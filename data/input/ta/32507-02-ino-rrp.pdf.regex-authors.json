Since 1997, the \ncountry  has  successfully  undertaken  key  financial  reforms, \nrestoring  the  solvency  and  profitability  of  the  banking  sector. \nHowever, the financial sector is shallow and dominated by banks. \nWhile  the  banking  sector  has  been  strengthened,  regulators \naccept that capital markets also need to be reformed and cross-\nborder links must be established to develop greater resilience to \nexternal shocks. Although Indonesia's nonbank financial sector, \nparticularly  the  capital  markets,  is  still  small,  it  offers  a  major \nopportunity to rebalance the financial sector and to reinvigorate \ngrowth through more efficient intermediation. \nIndonesia has adopted the appropriate macroeconomic policies to \narrest the impact of the global financial crisis and maintain steady \ngrowth. The International Monetary Fund has lauded the country's \nmacroeconomic  responses.  However,  the  current  crisis  also \nhighlights the longer-term challenges of improving the structural \nresilience  of  Indonesia's  financial  sector  by  expanding  and \nenhancing the regulation and governance of the capital markets. \nConfidence  that  credit  and  financial  markets  will  continue  to \nfunction properly will be crucial for economic activity to continue to \nincrease.  Short-term  measures  to  boost  liquidity  and  ward  off \npressure on balance sheets will need to be complemented by \nmedium-term  efforts  to  improve  financial  supervision  further \nthrough  better  governance  of  market  institutions  to  safeguard \nfinancial systems.  \n \nEnhanced domestic capital markets can be an efficient source of \nfinance for the Government and Indonesian corporations while \nproviding  a  safe  and  stable  environment  for  investors. \nInfrastructure  development  will  also  need  a  deep  and  vibrant \ndomestic  capital  market  to  ensure  that  refinancing  risks \n(refinancing existing debts) are reduced.  \n \n ", " ii   \nThe CMDPC was formulated as two single-tranche subprograms \nanchored on the Government's medium-term reform agenda and \nits  financial  sector  reform  programs  from  January  2006  to \nDecember 2010. This required steps to foster deeper and more \nliquid  domestic  capital  markets,  including  (i)  broadening  the \ninvestor base; (ii) encouraging the development of more diverse \nlocal  financial  products;  (iii)  improving  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional  frameworks;  (iv)  upgrading  governance  and \ntransparency;  and  (v)  establishing  more  sound  market \ninfrastructure  and  institutions.  ADB  approved  a  single-tranche \nloan  of  $300  million  under  subprogram  1  (2006\u20132007)  of  the \ncluster  in  December  2007.  Subprogram  2  covering  the  period \nOctober 2007\u2013August 2009 has built on continued reforms in line \nwith the Government\u2019s medium-term reform agenda and its capital \nmarket master plan, 2005\u20132009 (CMMP) and will provide a base \nfor the CMMP, 2010\u20132014, which is being developed with ADB \nTA and will be implemented with the support of a proposed TA \nthat is being separately processed. Subprogram 2 has also taken \ninto account achievements under subprogram 1. \n \nSubprogram 2 is an important part of the CMDPC, which aims to \nstrengthen transparency and information disclosure in the capital \nmarkets. This is essential to building confidence in those markets \nand  their  institutions,  expanding  regulatory  oversight,  and \nensuring enhanced price discovery and market liquidity for market \nparticipants.   \n \nThe  reform  agenda  is  structured  around  the  following  policy \noutcomes,  which  form  the  basis  of  the  CMPDC's  four \ncomponents:  \n(i)  enhancing  information  disclosure  and  price \ndiscovery, \n(ii)  promoting  deeper  and  more  liquid  financial \nmarkets, \n(iii)  improving  market  surveillance  and  investor \nprotection, and \n(iv)  strengthening  governance  and  human  resource \ncapacity. \n \nPost-program  monitoring  framework.  The  Government \nrecognizes that the reform program would need to extend over the \nmedium term beyond the two subprograms under the CMDPC. As \nsuch, a post-program monitoring framework for follow-up policy \nactions  covering  September  2009\u2013June  2011  has  been \ndeveloped  in  consultation  with  various  agencies.  This  will \neventually be used as the basis for a follow-up program, currently \nin the 2011\u20132012 country pipeline. The post-program monitoring \nframework is proposed to be supported by a TA that is being \nseparately  processed  in  parallel  with  support  from  other \ndevelopment  partners,  such  as  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency and the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment. \n ", "  iii  \n \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  subprogram  2  as  part  of  the  overall  impact  of \nCMDPC  will  be  greater  financial  sector  diversification  and \nresilience. The outcome of the Program is greater contribution by \nthe  capital  market  to  domestic  financing.  Towards  this  end, \nCMDPC  supports  accelerated  capital  market  growth  to  enable \nmore diversification of markets combined with stronger regulatory \nand  supervisory  capacity  to  ensure  resilience  of  the  financial \nsector that will protect the economic development of the economy. \nThe Program is expected to lead to an increase in the nonbank \nfinancial sector\u2019s share of total financial assets. \n \nThe Program Loan  A loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nFinancing Plan  be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility  for  subprogram  2.  The  loan  will  have  a \n15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n \nPeriod and Tranching  The  implementation  of  subprogram  2  covered  the  period  from \n  October 2007 to August 2009 with a single tranche loan of $300 \nmillion. The Government has completed all actions in the policy \nmatrix for subprogram 2. \n \nCounterpart Funds  The Government will use the local currency counterpart funds \n  generated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures \nand associated costs of reform and additional budgetary allocation \nfor the fiscal stimulus program that is addressing the international \ncredit crisis. \n \nExecuting Agency  Bapepam-LK \n   \nImplementation  Bapepam-LK has been the Executing Agency for subprogram 2 \nArrangements  and  has  monitored  and  facilitated  the  implementation  of  the \nagreed upon reform actions to ensure that they have been carried \nout in a timely manner. The implementing agencies have been \nBank Indonesia; Bapepam-LK, Debt Management Office (DMO),  \nthe Directorate of Taxes (DOT), all three under the Ministry of \nFinance and the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX). Bapepam-LK \nestablished  a  program  coordination  committee  chaired  by  the \nBapepam-LK  with  representatives  from  Bank  Indonesia, \nBappenas (National Development Planning Agency), DMO, DOT \nand IDX. The committee has been responsible for coordinating \nthe  implementation  program  actions  and  sustaining  them.  The \ncommittee has overseen the implementation of the policy actions \ndetailed in the policy letter and the policy matrix, and has provided \nguidance  and  direction  to  Bapepam-LK,  the  implementing \nagencies, and other line agencies of the Borrower.  \n \nProcurement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \n ", " iv   \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  (other  than \nitems specified on the list of ineligible items and imports financed \nby other bilateral and multilateral sources). The Government will \ncertify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the \nuse  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification.  \n \nProgram Benefits and  The CMDPC has provided a policy framework that encourages \nBeneficiaries   financial innovation such as new instruments and longer tenors \ncritical for infrastructure funding, and new kinds of intermediation. \nIt  will  enhance  information  disclosure  and  facilitate  price \ndiscovery,  thus  improving  the  efficiency  with  which  financial \nmarkets price risk. This will help to create deeper and more liquid \ncapital markets. At the same time, subprogram 2 will promote \nstronger  intermediaries  that  are  better  able  to  mobilize  and \nallocate  resources  and  risks.  Better  market  surveillance  and \ninvestor protection will promote stability and resilience, and are \nessential  for  capital  market  development.  To  maintain  the \nmomentum of reforms, the Government proposes to have in place \nthe CMMP, 2010\u20132014, which is being developed with ADB TA \nand will be implemented with the support of a proposed TA that is \nbeing  separately  processed.  Together  with  broader  economic \nreforms in Indonesia, the reform of capital markets will contribute \nto financial sector stability and more broadly to productivity growth \nand employment generation. \nRisks and Assumptions  The assumptions underlying subprogram 2 included the following: \n(i) The economy will withstand the direct adverse effects of the \nongoing global financial crisis, both the decline in economic \nactivity and the distortions created in Indonesian financial \nmarkets. \n(ii)The needed political will and commitment to pursue capital \nmarket reforms will continue. \n \nWhile mitigation measures have been put in place for some of the \nkey risks anticipated, subprogram 2 did face some risks.  \n \nImplications  of  the  global  financial  crisis  and  external \nvulnerabilities. The main risk from the global financial crisis has \nbeen the possibility of capital outflows that could have affected the \nfinancial  sector.  During  2005\u20132007  Indonesian  macroeconomic \nindicators have improved significantly, which translates into more \nresilience to external shocks. However, Indonesians residents can \nswitch to foreign assets easily, and there are significant foreign \nholdings, especially in the stock market and government bonds. \nThus, Indonesia has been vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor \nsentiments. The Government will also have larger gross financing \nneeds over the next two years, and the availability and cost of this \ngross  financing  poses  risks.  Stronger  macroeconomic \n ", "  v   \nperformance,  a  high  degree  of  policy  continuity,  better  fiscal \nperformance, and improved liquidity in the global financial markets \nhave mitigated these risks. \n \nFiduciary and reputational risks. Civil society groups have also \nraised  concerns  about the  proper  use  of  development  partner \nfunds.  Despite  considerable  improvements  in  the  fiduciary \nenvironment in Indonesia since 2000\u20132001, risks had remained. \nIndonesia has a public sector institutional reform agenda aiming \nto  address  concerns  over  the  quality  of  its  public  financial \nmanagement  procedures  and  processes.  The  World  Bank\u2019s \nGovernment Financial Management and Revenue Administration \nProject and other development partner programs are helping the \nGovernment  to  lock  in  and  implement  institutional  reforms  in \npublic financial management. \n \nSustaining reforms. The financial and operational autonomy of \nBapepam-LK, which is essential for its effective supervision of the \nnonbank  financial  sector,  will  need  an  appropriate  regulatory \nframework. Vested or competing interests might have opposed \nreforms being undertaken by the Government. The consolidation \nof reform initiatives in recent years, and the commitment by the \nGovernment to continue with reforms has ensured Indonesia is on \nthe  path  to  renewed  rapid  growth  and  accelerated  poverty \nreduction.  \n \nGovernance and capacity constraints. Unless institutional and \nhuman capacity development had been fostered within Bapepam-\nLK, the implementation of reforms might have been delayed. TA \nwill  help  address  Bapepam-LK\u2019s  capacity  weaknesses.  In \naddition,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  commit,  through  its \nnormal  budgetary  processes,  expanded  provisions  for  human \ndevelopment to sustain capacity building efforts over the medium \nand  long  term.  ADB  has  provided  support  for  anticorruption \nmeasures,  including  procurement  reforms,  during  the  past  7 \nyears, and a number of ongoing activities funded by ADB have an \nanticorruption  and  capacity  building  focus.  ADB  has  also \nsupported the Partnership for Governance Reform\u2014a cooperative \nrelationship between the Government, civil society, the private \nsector,  and  international  development  partners  on  governance \nreform.  \n \nEnforcement  constraints.  Bapepam-LK  continued  to  have \ndifficulty implementing its compliance and enforcement mandate \neffectively. The Program has helped to strengthen its investigation \nstrategies and enforcement skills through clearly defined capacity \nbuilding programs within Bapepam-LK. \n \n \n ", "       \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 2 of the Capital Market Development Program \nCluster (CMDPC).1 The program design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n \n2.  The  CMDPC  was  formulated  as  two  single-tranche  subprograms  anchored  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Reform  Program.  The  CMDPC  period  was  envisaged  from \nJanuary 2006 to December 2010. In December 2007, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved a single-tranche loan of $300 million for subprogram 1 (2006\u20132007).2 Subprogram 2 \ncovered October 2007 to August 2009. In developing subprogram 2, the medium-term reform \nagenda under subprogram 1 and its timing were to be reviewed in light of the accomplishments \nunder subprogram 1 and possible changes in the policy environment including the international \ncredit crisis, modified as appropriate, and supported by the single-tranche subprogram 2. This \nwas expected to provide flexibility in program design. The reform agenda under subprogram 2 \nhas built on reforms to enhance financial system resilience and has been in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s financial sector reform agenda. The Government has strongly supported the \nprocessing  of  subprogram  2  as  originally  envisaged  to  sustain  the  capital  market  reform \nprogram despite the international credit crisis. It recognized the need to strengthen Indonesia's \nfinancial market structure and regulatory architecture, reflecting the intensified concerns arising \nfrom the global financial crisis. As this intensified reform process will need to extend over 2009\u2013\n2011,  a  post-program  monitoring  framework  following  subprogram  2  for  follow-up  policy \nmeasures has been envisaged (para. 83). \n \nIII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n \n3.  Strong position. Indonesia entered the current global financial crisis in a strong position, \nwhich  was  built  through  sound  policies  under  favorable  conditions  during  recent  years. \nEconomic  growth  averaged  about  6%  during  2005\u20132007,  the  fiscal position  improved,  the \ncurrent  account  was  in  surplus,  public  and  external  debt  dropped  to  about  30%  of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP), and international reserves rose to a comfortable level sufficient to \ncover  6.5  months  of  imports.  In  addition,  financial  sector  soundness  became  more  firmly \ngrounded with profitable and well-capitalized banks, and better supervision. \n \n4.  Withstood initial shocks. Benefiting from these strong conditions, the economy has \nwithstood the external shocks from the international credit crisis. The global economic slowdown \naffected Indonesia's growth, although the impacts appear less severe than elsewhere. The \neconomic  slowdown  started  in  the  fourth  quarter  (Q4)  of  2008  because  of  broad-based \nweakening in private demand. Growth remained near decade-highs up to Q3 2008, before \nslowing sharply in Q4 with the worsening external environment and anticipatory retrenchment in \ndomestic demand. In 2009, growth weakened further to 4.4% in Q1 and 4.0% in Q2 2009 as the \nimpacts of a deeper global economic downturn hurt externally oriented sectors. However, its \nimpacts on Indonesia's growth are relatively smaller because the country has been less reliant \n                                                 \n1  Despite participating in the appraisal mission, the Japan International Cooperation Agency is unlikely to cofinance \nsubprogram 2 as no formal request has been received from the Government of Indonesia. \n2  ADB 2007.

Manila. \n ", "2   \non exports to support its economic growth. Investment growth also declined as firms reduced \nborrowing  and  postponed  part  of  their  investment  spending.  Although  private  consumption \nslowed  considerably  during  the  peak  of  the  financial  turbulence  in  Q4  2008,  consumer \nconfidence remained robust, supported by a good harvest and an unconditional cash transfer \nprogram supported by the Government\u2019s stimulus program.  \n \n5.  Returning market confidence. Signs of returning market confidence have emerged as \nindicated by the stronger rupiah and lower interest rates and these were reflected in a recovery \nin the stock market (Figure 1). Government consumption also increased, in part because of \nelection spending. External conditions are expected to remain difficult, which could weaken \neconomic growth further. Earlier Bank Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund projected \neconomic growth of 3%\u20134% in 2009. More recently, the Asian Development Outlook and the \nGovernment upgraded the growth projections to 4.3%. The economy is expected to gradually \nrecover in 2010, lifting growth to at least 5%. Public finances remained in good health, with the \nbudget barely in deficit in 2008 (\u20130.1% of GDP) and public debt ratios continuing their secular \ndecline,  providing  significant  additional  fiscal  space.  Moreover,  the  Government  and  Bank \nIndonesia have adopted a series of mitigating measures, including lowering banks\u2019 reserve \nrequirements, injecting liquidity through repurchase agreements, expanding eligible collateral for \nshort-term financing from Bank Indonesia, temporarily banning short selling, and expanding \ndeposit insurance coverage. These factors, combined with the stronger-than-expected growth in \nthe first half of 2009, boosted domestic and foreign investor confidence. Inflation has also eased \nsince Q3 2008. In October 2009, Bank Indonesia kept its policy rate at a record low of 6.5% in \nresponse to slowing inflation, a reduction in the pressure on the rupiah, and continued need to \nsupport growth. \n \nFigure 1: Indonesia Stock Exchange Composite Stock Price \nIndex and Equity Trading Value in 2009\nSource: Bank Indonesia.  \n \n6.  Fiscal stimulus. While Bank Indonesia has eased monetary policy, the Government has \nprovided fiscal stimulus to stimulate the economy. The fiscal stimulus package totaled Rp73.3 \ntrillion  (1.4%  of  GDP).  Protecting  the  poor  has  been  a  high  priority  during  the  economic \nslowdown. The economy is poised to revive, but a slow global recovery and lingering structural \nimpediments limit the upside. The subdued performance in the first half of 2009 has provided a \nbasis for real GDP to grow of up to 4.3% in 2009 followed by 5.4% in 2010, compared with 6.1% \nin 2008. The outlook for moderate inflation means that Bank Indonesia may lower the policy rate \nfurther by the end of 2009 before pausing, while fiscal policy continues to be expansionary.  \n \n7.  Strengthening of rupiah. Stabilizing the rupiah is a key objective following the earlier \nweakness, and the exchange rate firmed to Rp9,653 per US dollar in September 2009 from \nRp11,700 in March 2009. The lift to investor sentiment from the elections and firming of the \ncapital account contributed to a stronger rupiah during the recent months. This reflects both \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    3 \nexternal  developments,  particularly  improvements  in  global  risk  tolerance,  as  well  as  the \ncountry-specific factors such as increasing market confidence in the response of Indonesian \npolicy makers to the crisis, the sustainability of its financing needs, and the orderly elections.  \n \n8.  Stock market rebound. Like the rupiah, equities on Indonesia\u2019s stock markets have \nreturned  to  pre-October  2008  levels.  The  Jakarta  composite  index  rose  75.5%  between \nDecember 2008 and end August 2009, outperforming the 34% increase for the MSCI-EM index \nfor Asia. Nonresidents have moved back into the equities markets since March 2009 and are \nnet buyers of equities.  \n \n9.  Strong  banking  system.  The  direct  impacts  of  the  global  financial  crisis  on  the \ndomestic banking system have been muted because of limited direct investment in troubled US \nassets. The banking system, which accounts for 80% of the financial sector\u2019s assets, remains \nstrong (Figure 2). Some small banks, accounting for less than 0.5% of total banking assets, \nhave run into trouble since the onset of the crisis.3 Lending has started to expand, although not \nat an optimum level. The projected slowing of economic growth would affect corporations, which \ncould increase nonperforming loans (NPLs) further. The Government has expanded deposit \ninsurance on rupiah and US dollar deposits up to Rp2 billion. \n \nFigure 2: Macroeconomic Performance \nStock Indexes and Exchange Rates  Stable Rupiah Exchange Rate and Stock Market Recovery \n   \n % change in stock index                % appreciation against USD               Exchange Rate (LHS)                            Stock Index (RHS) \nSource; Bloomberg, up to 22 July 2009. \nCapital Adequacy Ratio Remains Stable  Non Performing Loans at Historical Low Levels \n   \n   \n \n                                                 \n3  In November 2008, the Government recapitalized Bank Century as its liquidity problems mounted and it breached \nthe minimum reserve requirement. In 2009, Bank IFI and one rural bank were liquidated.  \n ", "4   \n \n10.  Improved  balance  of  payments.  After  deteriorating  in  Q4  2008,  the  balance  of \npayments position improved considerably in the first half of 2009. A contraction in imports and \ninflows from tourism raised the current account surplus to $3.1 billion in Q2 2009 from $2.9 \nbillion in Q1, and a deficit of $0.7 billion in Q4 2008. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) is still \npositive, but decreased to $3.5 billion in the first half of 2009 from $5.2 billion in the second half \nof 2008. However, about the same amount of net FDI was recorded in the first half of 2008. \nMeanwhile, net portfolio investment was $3.9 billion in the first half of 2009.  \n \n11.  Acceptable foreign reserves. A shift to net capital inflows also helped boost official \nforeign exchange reserves to $62.3 billion in September 2009 from $50.6 billion in February \n2009.  \n \n12.  Sustainable public debt. Total external debt had fallen to about 29% of GDP in 2008, \ndown from 55% in 2004 (Table 1). Despite the large budget deficit in 2009, total public debt is \nestimated to increase to 33.1% of GDP in 2009. The debt service ratio over the 4-year period \nfell  to  an  estimated  18%  in  2008  from  27.1%  in  2004.  The  Government  will  emphasize \nstimulating economic growth in 2009 and 2010, while keeping the fiscal deficit at prudent levels. \nThe budget shortfall is expected to narrow to 1.6% of GDP in 2010 from 2.5% in 2009. The \nGovernment reached agreement with its development partners, including ADB, to provide more \nthan $5 billion of standby loans,4 if conditions in international capital become too restrictive. The \nGovernment expects that the standby loans will underpin market confidence and enable it to \nmeet its financing requirements from market sources. The Government also moved quickly to \nraise funds through the sale of domestic and international bonds. They sold $3 billion in 5- and \n10-year notes in February 2009, and sold Rp5.56 trillion of Islamic financial certificates, or sukuk \nbonds.  Furthermore,  Indonesia  has  access  to  a  total  of  $30  billion  under  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  currency  swap  arrangements  that  provide  additional  back  up  for  international \nreserves.  \n \n13.  Well  positioned  to  deal  with  further  economic  downturn.  The 2009 budget law \npassed in November 2008 continued the spirit of fiscal discipline, while containing a number of \npositive budgetary measures. As the economic outlook deteriorated rapidly, the Government in \nFebruary 2009 revised its revenue projections and formulated fiscal stimulus measures. As a \nresult, Indonesia\u2019s 2009 budget deficit has risen from 1.0% to 2.5% of GDP. The expanding \ndeficit  together  with  large  debt  repayments  increased  the  Government's  financing  needs \nsignificantly. Better market conditions have helped in meeting its financing requirements from \nthe market. As of mid-August, the Government had raised more than 80% of its financing needs \nfor all of 2009 from capital markets. \n \nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators for Indonesia, 2004\u20132009 \n \n  Fiscal Year \nItem  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009a \nA.

Indonesia  has  taken  important  steps  to  intensify  its \nstructural reform agenda, enhance the investment climate, improve public infrastructure, and \nstrengthen  financial  sector  intermediation.  A  time-bound  investment  policy  package  was \nintroduced subsequently in February 2006, and the Investment Law was passed in March 2007. \nThe Government prepared and undertook a inter-ministerial review of a presidential regulation \non the implementation of the 2007 Investment Law. An infrastructure reform package was \nadopted in 2006 to support the investment policy package. Notable recent reforms include the \npassage in September 2008 of the amended Income Tax Law, which reduces corporate and \npersonal  rates.  Economic  policy  packages  covering  the  investment  climate  have  been \nintroduced  in  each  of  the  last  3  years,  and  major  reforms  of  customs  administration  are \nunderway. \n  \n15.  Need for continuing capital market reforms. Indonesia has adopted the appropriate \nmacroeconomic  policies  to  arrest  the  impact  of  the  crisis  and  maintain  steady  growth.  Its \nmacroeconomic responses have been lauded.5  However, the current crisis also highlights the \nlonger-term  challenges  of  improving  the  structural  resilience  of  Indonesia's  financial  sector \nthrough accelerated capital market development and expanding and enhancing the regulation \nand governance of its capital markets. Confidence that credit and financial markets will continue \nto function properly will be crucial for supporting the further expansion of economic activity. \nShort-term measures to boost liquidity and ward off pressure on balance sheets will need to be \n                                                 \n5 International Monetary Fund. 2009. Report on the Article IV Consultation. Washington, DC (June). \n ", "6   \ncomplemented by medium-term efforts to further improve financial supervision and, through \nbetter governance of market institutions, to safeguard financial systems. In this environment, the \ncapacity of the Indonesia capital markets must be expanded in a measured way to reduce \nrefinancing  risks  as  capital  markets  are  still  small  compared  to  the  banking  sector.  The \ndevelopment  of  capital  market  capacity  which  can  provide  longer-term  financing  will  also \nrebalance and create enhanced resilience in the financial sector. These enhanced domestic \ncapital  markets can  be  an  efficient  source  of  finance  for  the  Government  and  Indonesian \ncorporations,  while  providing  a  safe  and  stable  environment  for  investors.  Infrastructure \ndevelopment will also need a deep and vibrant domestic capital market.  \n \n16.  The  medium-term  development  plan. Continued fiscal prudence has provided the \nGovernment with the fiscal space needed to meet Indonesia\u2019s development challenges. The \nmedium-term national development plan, 2004\u201320096 provides a clear set of targets that the \nGovernment wants to meet by the end of the plan period. The plan sets out a good policy \nframework for the reforms and investments needed for each sector. Some adjustment in growth \nrates for 2009 and 2010 has now been acknowledged because of the impact of the global crisis. \nPolicies envisaged under the Government\u2019s medium-term macroeconomic framework aimed to \nhelp mitigate economic vulnerabilities, improve the business climate, and encourage investment.  \n \n17.  Key constraints on accelerating GDP growth include the absence of (i) a stable and \nconsistent legal and regulatory environment, (ii) well-developed capital markets and nonbank \nfinancial sector, and (iii) adequate skills and institutional capacity within public and market \ninstitutions. The 1997 crisis raised awareness of the risks associated with a growth-oriented \ndevelopment agenda without a deep and diverse financial sector. The financial system is still \ndominated by banks, although increasing attention is being paid to the nonbank financial sector. \nIn November 2004, the Government approved an action plan for the nonbank financial sector in \nconsultation  with  ADB.  The  action  plan  included  measures  to  support  and  implement  the \nGovernment\u2019s capital market master plan, 2005\u20132009 (CMMP). The CMMP focuses mainly on \nstrengthening  capital  markets  by  improving  surveillance,  increasing  legal  certainty, \nstrengthening the role and quality of market participants, expanding products, and developing \nIslamic financial products.  \n \n18.  Financial  sector  reforms.  Underscoring  the  importance  of  achieving  a  deep  and \ndiverse financial sector, two financial sector policy packages (FSPPs) were issued in July 2006 \nand July 2007. Both packages promoted financial sector reforms through clear policy, programs, \nand outputs. The policy actions outlined in the packages covered a number of areas with a time \nframe for actions up to July 2008, including strengthening financial system stability through \ngreater coordination across regulators. Progress on the actions has been largely on track. ADB \nprovided significant inputs to the preparation of the two FSPPs. \n \n19.  Capital market master plan. ADB has also been involved in the Government\u2019s reform \nprocess through policy dialogue and technical assistance (TA).7 This regulatory reform TA has \nprovided support to implement the main elements of the action plan (para. 17) and the CMMP. \nThese measures have established a good basis for further market development. While the \nCMDPC  is  predominantly  focused  on  development  of  the  capital  market  through  the \nimplementation of the CMMP, it also embraces some of the broader issues covered under the \n                                                 \n6   Presidential Regulation 7/2005 on the Medium-Term National Development Plan issued on 19 January 2005. \n7  ADB. 2002.

The CMMP for 2010\u20132014 is proposed to be developed through ADB TA (footnote 2) \nduring 2009. \n \n20.  Other  supporting  programs. ADB is also involved in a series of program lending \noperations in conjunction with the World Bank\u2019s development policy loans (DPLs). These will \nsupport the Government\u2019s broad-based, cross-cutting, medium-term investment climate and \ngovernance reform agenda. The first DPL was approved by the World Bank in 2004. ADB \nprovided parallel support in 2004 through financial sector and state-owned enterprise (SOE) \nreform programs. In 2005, at the Government\u2019s request, ADB approved the Development Policy \nSupport Program (DPSP).8 The second9 DPSP was approved in 2006, the third10 DPSP in 2007, \nand the fourth11 DPSP in 2008, while the fifth DPSP is being processed for consideration in 2009. \nThe DPSP series is embedded in the Government\u2019s medium-term national development plan, \n2004\u20132009. In addition to the Public Expenditure Support Facility (footnote 4), a Countercyclical \nSupport Facility was also approved in 2009 at the request of the Government.12 \n  \n21.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program.13 Financial sector deepening that facilitates \ndomestic resource mobilization was identified as one of the five key areas for ADB intervention \nunder the country strategy and program (CSP), 2006\u20132009. The CSP recommends using a \nsingle-tranche cluster approach for program loans to support the Government\u2019s medium-term \nreform agenda. The CSP also envisages TA in support of these loans. The CMDPC evolves \nfrom the Government\u2019s medium-term national development plan to support its financial sector \nreform agenda in line with the CSP, with a principal focus on the development of capital markets \nin Indonesia (Figure 3). \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005.

At an M2-to-GDP ratio of 49.5% at the end of \n2008,14 Indonesia lags behind regional competitors such as Malaysia and Thailand, which have \nratios of more than 100%. The long-term debt market had been constrained by delays in \npension and insurance sector reforms. Much liquidity was locked up in government bonds. In \n2008, with total banking assets as a percentage of GDP of 43.8%, Indonesia had the smallest \nmarket in this region (Table 2).

East Asian Finance: The Road to Robust Markets. \nWashington, DC: World Bank.  \n \n23.  High concentration of banking institutions. Banks account for more than 80% of \nfinancial sector assets. Despite its size and recent improvements, the Indonesian banking \nsector is not a source of long-term capital as more than 90% of bank deposits have a maturity of \nless than 1 year. As a reaction to the 1997 crisis, bankers in general are risk averse in their \napproach to lending and are appropriately focused on working capital financing given their \ndeposit base. As a result, the growth of loans has stayed below deposit growth, making banks \nvery liquid. While interbank lending has been improving since November 2008 and rupiah \nliquidity in the system is sufficient, reports suggest that it is not well distributed. Larger banks \ntypically  are  liquid,  while  smaller  banks  are  facing  problems.  Other  indicators  suggest  the \nbanking sector remains in relatively good health overall, with banks lifting their capital-to-assets \nratio and only experiencing a marginal increase in nonperforming loans during Q1 2009. \n \n24.  Undeveloped  nonbank  financial  subsector.  The  nonbank  financial  subsector  still \naccounts for less than one-fifth of total financial assets. Total assets of insurance companies \naccounted for about 5% of GDP as of June 2008, and pension funds net assets were only about \n2% of GDP. The Government considers the development of the nonbank financial sector urgent \nand imperative. Indonesian institutional investors are small and have not been a source of long-\n                                                 \n14 The M2-to-GDP ratio (demand, savings, and time deposits, or M2, divided by the output of goods and services, \nnamely GDP) is a common measure of financial depth. \n ", "10   \nterm capital. Indonesia\u2019s pension funds and insurance companies invest a significant portion of \ntheir  resources  in  short-term  bank  deposits.  Total  market  capitalization  of  Indonesia  stock \nexchange (IDX) as of October 2009 accounted for 36.1% of GDP, and the total value of \ncorporate bond issuance was 1.3% of GDP.  \n \n25.  Stronger  governance  and  regulations  needed.  Financial  sector  regulation  and \nsupervision are under the authority of two main supervisory authorities. Banks are regulated and \nsupervised by Bank Indonesia, the central bank, which has been strengthened significantly in \nthe aftermath of the 1997 crisis and has been given financial and operational autonomy. The \nBapepam-LK was initially the Capital Markets Supervisory Agency (Bapepam) established in \n1976 under Presidential Decree No. 52/1976, and it has weaker powers and capacity compared \nto Bank Indonesia. In 2005, Bapepam-LK responsibilities were expanded. It is now responsible \nfor the regulation and day-to-day supervision of capital markets as well as the nonbank financial \ninstitutions, including insurance and private pensions, as an integral part of the Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF).  The  MOF  is  responsible  for  high-level  policy  matters,  and  Bapepam-LK \nexercises delegated authority in relation to the conduct of investigations, inspections, and other \nregulatory  functions.  The  merger  and  the  endorsement  of  a  plan  for  improvements  in  the \nregulatory and supervisory structure of the newly created Bapepam-LK were significant steps \ntoward strengthening supervision of nonbank financial services and the capital markets. A \nsenior (echelon 1)15 official was appointed to head the merged entity, paving the way for a \nconsolidation of nonbank financial institution supervision with the supervision of the capital \nmarkets. \n \n26.  In 1999, Parliament passed the Banking Law to insulate the regulatory and supervisory \nframework  from  political  interference.  The  legislation  required  the  establishment  of  the \nConsolidated Supervisory Authority for Financial Services (OJK) by the end of 2002 to be able \nto cope with financial conglomeration and innovation, and to lower the cost of regulation by \nmaking efficient use of scarce resources. However, prudential regulation of banks focusing on \ntheir  safety  and  soundness  and  systemic  risk  is  fundamentally  different  from  the  investor \nprotection needs of securities or capital markets, which are focused on disclosure, fairness, and \nprevention of fraud through enforcement of business rules and punishment of offenders. As \nbecame evident following 1999, merging two different approaches and cultures poses significant \nchallenges, not least of which is the need to manage the risks of a decline in the quality of \nsupervision during the transition phase. This challenge is more complex in Indonesia, where the \ntwo entities to be merged differed sharply in terms of independence, salary structures, and \nregulatory capacity and were operating in areas where systemic risks remain a key concern. \nRecognizing these difficult institutional issues and the systemic risks, Parliament amended the \nBanking Law in December 2003 and postponed the establishment of the OJK from 2002 to \n2010. \n \n27.  Bapepam-LK has an intensive program to improve the capacity of its entire staff. ADB \nand  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  are  supporting  this \ntransformation  and  providing  training  and  human  resource  development  assistance  to \nBapepam-LK.  The  MOF  supports  further  strengthening  of  Bapepam-LK\u2019s  financial  and \noperational autonomy through annual budget allocations. Since 2007, steps have been initiated \nto enhance Bapepam-LK\u2019s operational and financial autonomy through legal and regulatory \nmeasures  designed  to  provide  stronger  regulation  of  capital  markets  and  the  contractual \nsavings industry. Major steps were also undertaken to strengthen the associated institutional \n                                                 \n15  All structural positions in Indonesia\u2019s national civil service are grouped into echelons, with echelon 1 being the most \nsenior. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    11 \nstructures of MOF and Bapepam-LK through restructuring of key departments, combined with \nsignificant pay increases. They were also given the authority to recruit staff from the market. \n \n28.  Shallow equities market. Indonesia\u2019s equities market has improved steadily since 2002 \nand was among the best performers in the region in 2004 and 2005. In 2006, it was among the \ntop three stock markets in the world with growth of about 50% in market capitalization. Despite \nthe growth, Indonesia\u2019s equities market remains one of the smallest in Asia and the Pacific.  The \nnumber of listed companies increased from 336 in 2005 to 401 as of July 2009 with total market \ncapitalization of Rp1,719 trillion. In 2008, the downturn in the global economy had a significant \nimpact on the composite index of the IDX and its market capitalization in 2008, but the market \nhas now recovered (para 8). \n \n29.  Promising fixed-income market. Compared to other markets in Asia, the bond market \nin Indonesia is still small. The total bond market dropped to 13.6% of GDP in 2008 from 22.2% \nin 2007. At 12.3% of GDP, the government bond market in Indonesia is among the smallest in \nAsia. Only Hong Kong, China at 9.1% of GDP is smaller, but it has a sizeable corporate bond \nmarket at 30.4% of GDP. All the other countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) have much larger bond markets as a percentage of GDP. Malaysia is the biggest \n(76.0%), followed by Singapore (72.0%), Thailand (52.4%), the Philippines (34.2%), and Viet \nNam (14.2%).  \n \n30.  Government bonds. However, the Government of Indonesia is trying to tap the bond \nmarket as a source of financing for economic development and raising funds, including through \nbuy-back arrangements and issuance of sovereign Islamic bonds (sukuk) in 2009. Maturities go \nout to 20 years, considerably longer than in 2000. While the credit default swap premiums \nincreased  steadily  from  2007  to  the  peak  in  September  2008,  it  started  to  decline  from \nDecember 2008 and fell substantially to pre-crisis levels as of August 2009. \n \n31.  Banks hold about three-quarters of government bonds by value. The Debt Management \nOffice (DMO) has followed a strategy of consolidating bond issues\u2014through buy-backs and \nasset swaps\u2014and has sought to build benchmark issues. The DMO issued its first treasury bills \nin  June  2007  with  a  12-month  tenor.  Retail  investors'  participation  increased  with  the \nintroduction of retail government bonds, issued exclusively to Indonesians in the primary market \nin July 2007. A system of primary dealers was introduced in December 2006, and these dealers \nhave been providing two-way quotes. In the secondary market, an over-the-counter market and \nthe exchange market coexist, both offering avenues for trading of all debt securities. \n \n32.  Limited  corporate  bond  market.  The  corporate  bond  market  in  Indonesia  is \ninsignificant compared to government bond markets. Corporate bonds account for only about \n1.3% of GDP compared with about 12.3% of GDP for the government bond market. This \npercentage  is  also  low  compared  to  neighboring  countries\u2014Republic  of  Korea  (47.0%); \nMalaysia (34.6%); Hong Kong, China (30.4%); Singapore (29.0%); Thailand (10.4%); and the \nPhilippines  (3.3%).  However,  the  potential  for  developing  the  corporate  bond  market  in \nIndonesia is vast given the number of infrastructure development projects in the pipeline, but \nthis will require a more comprehensive policy in combination with concerted efforts from the \nGovernment and corporate sectors. Greater pricing transparency is expected in the future with \nthe establishment of Bond Pricing Agency and the Government's benchmark issues. \n \n33.  Market intermediaries. The IDX is the national stock exchange based in Jakarta. It was \npreviously  known  as  the  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange  before  its  name  was  changed  in  2007 \nfollowing  the  merger  with  the  Surabaya  Stock  Exchange.  The  new  merged  exchange  is \n ", "12   \noperating successfully. However, Indonesia still maintains two systems for clearing, settlement, \nand deposits: the Indonesian Central Securities Depository (KSEI) and the Indonesian Clearing \nand Guarantee Corporation (KPEI). IDX, KSEI, and KPEI are self-regulating organizations with \nthe authority to set rules and oversee the activities of broker-dealers, and custodian banks \ndealing  in  securities  and  bond  trading.  Indonesia  has  158  securities  brokerages.  Pefindo, \nestablished in 1994, is the country's largest rating agency. It is an affiliate of Standard and \nPoor\u2019s and has adapted its rating methodology. The only other rating agency is PT Fitch Rating \nIndonesia,  incorporated  in  2006.  An  inability  to  obtain  and/or  enforce  timely  commercial \njudgments  has  hampered  the  development  of  the  financial  sector  and  capital  markets  in \nparticular. Other agencies have provided support to the judiciary to enhance its capacity, but \nmore assistance is needed. \n \n34.  High trading cost. Total trading cost includes commission and fees charged for trading \nactivities. Based upon a market survey, Indonesia's total trading cost of 72 basis points in 2005 \nhad declined to 53 basis points in 2008. Nonetheless, Indonesia is the second-most cost-\ninefficient market in Asia, trailing only the Philippines. In 2008, most countries had more efficient \ntrading costs\u2014Malaysia (41 basis points); Thailand (42); Singapore (36); and Hong Kong, China \n(41). However, these costs are estimates and comparisons are problematic. \n \n35.  Regional integration of equity markets. Regional integration can facilitate domestic \ncapital market development as well as global integration by providing the liquidity, scale, and \ncapacity to compete globally and manage volatility more effectively. In one significant step \ntoward regional integration, the ASEAN capital market regulators, through the ASEAN Capital \nMarkets Forum, have developed an Integration Plan to anchor integration of capital markets. \nAdditionally, five ASEAN exchanges\u2014Bursa Malaysia, Indonesia Stock Exchange, Philippine \nStock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, and the Stock Exchange of Thailand\u2014had signed a \nmemorandum of understanding (MOU) on 23 February 2009 to establish an electronic trading \nplatform by the fourth quarter of 2010. A virtual ASEAN Board will be established, on this board, \neach of the five exchanges will list its top 30 stocks by market capitalization. These 150 \ncompanies represent around 60% of the total market capitalization of the five markets. \n \n36.  Need  for  stronger  corporate  governance.  In  March  2005,  a  World  Bank  review \nconcluded that a number of initiatives were underway that could eventually result in compliance \nwith  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  principles.16 \nHowever,  practices  and  enforcement  diverge.  ADB  has  supported  the  development  of  a \ncorporate governance code for SOEs and strengthening of the governance standards under the \nlisting requirements for the Jakarta Stock Exchange.17 Guidelines to improve performance and \ncorporate governance at state-owned banks were issued in February 2007. Bapepam-LK has \ntried to increase the standards of management of financial and public Institutions by issuing \nminimum  standards  for  commissioners  and  directors  of  regulated  entities  and  mandatory \ninternal audits for public firms and public issuers. In its 2008 Doing Business report,18 the World \nBank rated investor protection in Indonesia in 2007 at slightly below the OECD average. The \nindexes range from 0 and 10, with higher values indicating greater disclosure, greater liability of \ndirectors,  greater  powers  of  shareholders  to  challenge  a  transaction,  and  better  investor \n                                                 \n16 The OECD principles provide specific guidelines for policy makers, regulators and market participants in improving \nthe legal, institutional and regulatory framework that underpins corporate governance, with a focus on public traded \ncompanies. \n17 ADB. 2001.

Manila.  \n18 World Bank and International Finance Corporation. 2008.  Doing Business Report 2008 is the fifth in a series of \nannual reports investigating the regulations that enhance business activity and those that constrain it. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    13 \nprotection.  Particularly  noteworthy  was  Indonesia's  score  of  9.0  in  the  disclosure  index, \ncompared with a regional average of 5.0 and an OECD average of 6.4. On the other hand, the \ncountry scored only 3.0 in the shareholder suits index, compared with a regional average of 6.3 \nand an OECD average of 6.5. \n \n37.  Sharia-based capital market products. Islamic finance in Indonesia is newer than \nconventional finance, but has grown rapidly. Bank Indonesia has developed a blueprint for \nsharia banking derived from Islamic values. Sharia-based capital market products were first \nintroduced in Indonesia by a sharia investment fund in mid-1997. The Government is working on \na comprehensive framework for Islamic finance covering the legal framework, market rules, \naccounting,  and  tax  structure  to  support  its  growth.  Bapepam-LK  has  been  involved  in \ndiscussions with the Indonesian Accounting Association to formulate the issuance of sharia \naccounting standards. In July 2008, the Parliament approved the issuance of government sukuk \nworth $2 billion. With credit markets tight, the Republic of Indonesia sold a $650 million 5-year \nglobal sukuk in April 2009. This development has been seen as a strong indication of the \nGovernment\u2019s increased attention to developing sharia finance.  \n \n38.  Derivatives. Indonesia has exchange-traded derivatives and over-the-counter (OTC) \nderivatives. Exchange-traded derivatives are traded on the IDX, whereas OTC derivatives are \ntraded  mostly  by  banks  under  the  oversight of  Bank  Indonesia.  IDX  offers  three  types  of \nexchange-traded derivatives: (i) stock options, (ii) index future contracts, and (iii) rights or \nwarrants. The exchange-traded derivatives market in Indonesia is small. The OTC derivatives \nare more actively traded by banks in the foreign exchange market. When the economic recovery \nhas  solidified,  Bank  Indonesia,  in  coordination  with  Bapepam-LK  and  IDX  are  planning  to \nintroduce interest rate and bond futures to further develop bond markets. \n \n39.  Newly introduced financial products. New financial products include (i) exchange-\ntraded funds, (ii) asset-backed securities (although no company has issued such securities \nsince the regulations were introduced), (iii) single stock futures, and (iv) stock lending and \nborrowing. A presidential decree on secondary mortgage financing was issued in February 2005 \nestablishing the Secondary Mortgage Corporation (PT Sarana Multigriya Finansial). Its function \nis to purchase qualified mortgages from financial institutions and issue bonds backed by these \nassets. It recently issued its maiden instrument in the form of the Asset-Backed Exchange-\nTraded Fund in February 2009, based on the securitization of the mortgage portfolio of Bank \nTabungan Negara. \n40.  Contractual  savings  industry.  The  insurance  industry  is  still  small.  The  ratio  of \npremiums to GDP rose from 1.6% in 2006 to 1.9% in 2007. The gross premiums collected by \nthe insurance industry in 2007 reached Rp74.51 trillion, 42% higher than the previous year's \nfigure of Rp52.42 trillion. Since the Asian financial crisis, the Government has introduced some \nimportant  regulatory  changes  governing  insurers,  including  a  new  risk-weighted  capital \nadequacy regime to encourage mergers, risk-based supervision, and an increase in the capital \nrequirements for new insurance companies. The industry is heavily concentrated, with the top \nfive general insurance companies accounting for 51% of general insurance assets and the top \nfive life insurance companies accounting for 55% of life insurance assets. The licenses of eight \ncompanies\u2014five life insurance and three general insurance\u2014were withdrawn in 2006. The \nGovernment still needs to address the remaining one state life and two insolvent general \ninsurance companies. Insurance companies currently invest about 25% of their assets in short-\nterm  deposits.  The  insurance  industry  needs  to  be  consolidated  into  fewer  but  stronger \ncompanies. Policy holders must be protected and standards raised in anticipation of reductions \nto  barriers  to  entry  with  equal  treatment  under  freer  service  agreements.  The  quality  of \n ", "14   \nprofessional  services  to  the  pension  and  insurance  industry  also  needs  to  be  improved, \nespecially  actuaries  and  accountants  but  also  asset  managers,  to  shift  toward  risk-based \nsupervision. \n \n41.  The  Government  regulation  81/2008  requires  the  general  insurance  companies  to \nincrease their minimum equity from Rp40 billion to Rp100 billion over a transition period from \n2010 to 2014. Higher capital requirements imposed on insurance firms may foster consolidation \nof the industry. Takaful insurance19 is also expected to emerge in Indonesia.   \n \n42.  Small pension sector. In Indonesia, the pension sector is small, accounting for less \nthan 4.7% of GDP in assets, compared with Thailand at 8.4%, Malaysia at 57.0%, and Australia \nat 75.0%. Only 12.0% of the workforce is covered by public pension and old-age savings \nprograms, provided by PT Jamsostek for private sector workers, by PT Taspen for civil servants, \nand by PT Asabri for the military. Less than 2% of the workforce is covered by voluntary private \npensions.  The  Private  Pensions  Law  11/1992  will  be  reviewed  and  amendments  will  be \nsubmitted together with the amendments proposed to the Capital Market Law and the Insurance \nLaw. The uncertainties that prevent the growth of the pension industry need to be resolved \ntogether with the uncertain implementation of Law 40 on the National Social Security System \nand debates on the funding of benefits under Law 13 of 2003 on Labor.  \n \n43.  Bapepam-LK, which oversees the voluntary pension schemes, is taking steps to improve \nthe private pension industry, particularly to increase risk-based supervision. To enhance the \nperformance of pension fund industry, the Ministerial Decree on Pension (Decree 199/PMK-\n010) was issued in December 2008 to allow for investment in a wider range of domestic \ninstruments.  \n \n44.  Accounting  and  auditing  standards.  The  Indonesian  Institute  of  Accountants \nestablishes accounting, auditing, and ethics standards and is also involved in certification and \neducation. MOF had prepared a draft public accountancy law, which was expected to address \nthe  legal  liability  of  accountants  and  independent  public  oversight  system.  The  Indonesia \nFinancial Accounting Standards consist of International Financial Reporting Standards and US \nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles-based standards, as well as sector-specific rules. \nThe Capital Market Law requires public companies to file audited financial statements with \nBapepam-LK  and  also  provides  for  Bapepam\u2013LK  to  establish  additional  accounting \nrequirements  for  the  capital  markets.  Under  the  Capital  Market  Law,  issuers  and  public \ncompanies are required to have their financial statements audited by the auditors registered \nwith  Bapepam-LK.  These  auditors  must  comply  with  the  Code  of  Ethics  and  professional \nstandards. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n45.  Need  for  reforms. Capital market reforms are crucial to increasing financial sector \nresilience, protecting development momentum, and accelerating poverty reduction. Since the \n1997 crisis, Indonesia has undertaken key financial reforms, restoring the banking sector to \nsolvency and profitability. However, economic growth has not returned to pre-crisis levels. \nIndonesia needs investments, especially in infrastructure, but the domestic financial sector is \nnot yet able to provide the longer-term credits that would not involve refinancing risks. The \nfinancial sector is shallow and dominated by banks. Bank lending balance sheets make them \nunsuited  to  meet  the  nation\u2019s  need  for  long-term  financing.  The  nonbank  financial  sector, \n                                                 \n19 The word Takaful is derived from the Arabic root word kafala, which means mutual guarantee or protection. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    15 \nparticularly the capital markets, offers a major opportunity to reinvigorate growth thorough more \nefficient intermediation.    \n    1.  Enhance Price Information and Price Discovery  \n \n46.  The debt market has long suffered from a lack of price transparency for both government \nand corporate bonds. No entity is able to offer a credible and reliable fair valuation service to the \nmarket. The availability of reliable and timely information is essential for capital markets to \nfunction efficiently and for the prices to reflect the fundamentals. Subprogram 1 supported the \nissuance  of  rules  to  establish  a  bond  pricing  agency.  These  measures  were  aimed  at \naddressing the major regulatory failures in 2005 that resulted in the mispricing of fixed-income \nsecurities in mutual funds, which caused fund investors to lose confidence. The bond pricing \nagency, which has been operational since July 2009, is expected to provide an independent and \nobjective fair value of all bonds each day. The OECD principles of good governance suggest \nthat  firms  should  disclose  all  material  information  in  accordance  with  high  standards  of \naccounting and financial and nonfinancial disclosure. Previously, there was no mandatory post-\ntrade reporting regulation for market participants in the government and corporate bond markets. \nFurther, no mechanisms were in place to enable consolidation of market data or provide real-\ntime information. Before November 2007,  an OTC fixed-income trading system that could be \nused to quote prices, review product information, and facilitate negotiation and trade reporting \nfor government and corporate bonds was available, but the dealers had few incentives to use it. \nThe  system  was  replaced  in  November  2007  by  a  centralized  trading  platform,  and  the \ntransactions executed on the exchange are required to be reported in real time to the central \ntrade aggregator. For trades outside the exchange, the reporting time from trade execution also \nneeded to be shortened. Rules and procedures to enable prompt public disclosure of changes \nin  beneficial  ownership  of  officers,  directors,  and  shareholders  with  5%  holding  of  public \ncompanies needed to be improved in line with international best practice.    \n \n  2.   Develop Deeper and More Liquid Capital Markets \n \n47.  Indonesia's markets are smaller and the secondary markets are less liquid than those of \nmost  other  Southeast  Asian  economies  (para  28).  Indonesia\u2019s  equity  market  has  been \nimproving steadily since 2002. While the market value increased to $204.8 billion in 2007\u2014\nbefore dropping to $91.4 billion in March 2009 because of the global crisis\u2014Indonesia remains \nthe fourth-smallest market in Asia and the Pacific. The biggest constraint on the development of \nthe bond markets has been the limited liquidity in the secondary markets, which affects the \nefficiency of the market overall. Against this background, Indonesia faces two challenges: (i) \ncatching up with its neighbors, and (ii) ensuring that it is able to participate in efforts to integrate \nregional markets and economies.  \n \n \n ", "16   \nFigure 4:  Efficiency of the Indonesian Securities Markets \nC \nLiquidity  Investor base low \nInstitutional investors limited \nSavings rate low at 25% \nFree float small \nA  B  Not many listed companies \nInformation to price  Transaction costs  \naccurately  (explicit  taxes,  commissions, \nTransaction  costs  reduced  but \nfees, and impact) \nstill  high  compared  with  other \nexchanges in Asia and the Pacific \nCorporate \n\uf0b7  90% of the bonds traded are \ngovernance \ngovernment securities \n\uf0b7  Crowding out other instruments  Complementary \n\uf0b7  True yield curve yet to emerge  \uf0b7  Highly concentrated  Market infrastructure  structure \n\uf0b7  Bond  Pricing  Agency   ownership of the publicly  and mechanisms\noperationalized  listed corporate sector  \uf0b7  Short-selling and \n\uf0b7  Dealers are mostly banks  \uf0b7  Limited float  \uf0b7  JSX and SSX  margin trading \n\uf0b7  Need to improve transparency  \uf0b7  Corporate governance  merged  need revision \nin pricing  needs strengthening  \uf0b7  Settlement T+3  \uf0b7  Not many hedging \n\uf0b7  Two credit rating agencies  \uf0b7  Minority shareholders  (3 days after the     instruments \n\uf0b7  Limited issues of private debt  need legal empowerment  date of trade)  \uf0b7  Not conducive tax \npapers  \uf0b7  Bankruptcy law needs  \uf0b7  Investor protection  environment \n\uf0b7  Disclosure needs improvement  revision  fund to be set up by \n2010 \nJSX = Jakarta Stock Exchange, SSX = Surabaya Stock Exchange. \nSource: Adapted from Ghosh, Swati R. 2006.

Overall liquidity \nin government bonds has improved, but the market is still volatile. The government bond market \noperates with daily intraday spreads of 50\u2013100 basis points, which is high for the government \nsegment, because of the lack of efficient market makers20 and excessive control over price \nformation by foreign intermediaries that control the major trade flows. Ownership distribution is \nalso skewed towards banking intermediaries that act more like investors than dealers. A lack of \ninteragency policy coordination because of overlapping regulatory functions between the DMO \nand Bank Indonesia hampers development and adds to market distortions. Regular updates on \nthe annual auction calendar for government bonds were needed to be provided to market \nparticipants to provide clarity on issuance expectations as otherwise this increase the risk to \nparticipants, which raises the cost of debt and reduces the attractiveness of the market. The \nlack of market making by intermediaries and the absence of credible benchmarks or any form of \nhedging mechanism have also affected price formation. The continuous replacement of Bank \nIndonesia securities with short-term treasury bills with a greater range of maturities is also \nrequired to develop the short end of the yield curve. The suitability of allowing nonbank primary \ndealers to participate in the Bank Indonesia repurchase agreement window should also be \nconsidered to provide equal opportunities for all market participants. \n \n49.  Another issue that affects market efficiency is Bank Indonesia\u2019s scripless securities \nsettlement system, which undertakes the depository activity for government bonds but does not \nprovide direct access for nonbanking institutions that are not subregistries. The level of system \nintegration with the subregistries is poor and contributes heavily to operational costs and the \n                                                 \n20 A brokerage or bank that maintains a firm bid and ask price in a given security by standing ready, willing, and able \nto buy or sell at publicly quoted prices. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    17 \nlack  of  straight-through  processing21 capabilities  for  the  market.  Issuance  of  government \nsecurities would improve with a coherent policy for debt issuance, a proper primary dealer \nsystem, and infrastructure to support the primary and secondary market for government debt \nsecurities. Poor liquidity in the corporate segment is the result of the limited supply of high-\nquality  corporate  bonds.  Because  the  supply  is  inadequate  to  meet  demand,  institutional \ninvestors such insurance and pension funds buy up most issues and hold them to maturity. ADB \nis  providing  TA  to  Bapepam-LK  (footnote  2)  to  create  a  more  liquid,  transparent,  and \ncompetitive bond market with wider and more harmonized access throughout the industry.  \n \n50.  Repurchase markets. The Government began a market for repurchase agreements in \n2004 and launched a master repurchase agreement in 2005. However, market participants have \nmajor  problems  with  the  agreement  because  it  lacks  clarity  with  regard  to  its  terms  and \nconditions and the extent to which parties can exercise their rights if a counterparty defaults. \nOnly five institutions have executed the master repurchase agreement to facilitate repurchasing \ntransactions. Another key hurdle is the master repurchase agreement structure, which is based \non a sale and buy-back with full legal transfer of securities, resulting in the participants being \ntaxed at both stages of the transaction. Intensification of these reforms is badly needed to \ninitiate the development of the repurchase markets. \n \n51.  Equity market liquidity. In 2008, 8% (29 companies) of the 394 listed companies were \nnot traded at all, while 55% (189 companies) accounted for less than 0.1% of the total trading \nvolumes  on  the  IDX.  The  main  reasons  for  the  lack  of  liquidity  of  these  shares  are  (i) \nconcentrated share ownership causing minimal real free float, (ii) an absence of corporate \naction plans, (iii) weak investor relations, and (iv) insufficient provision of information to the \npublic.  As  a  consequence,  the  market  remains  small  and  illiquid,  and  this  restricts  the \ndevelopment  of  domestic  institutional  investors.  The  process  of  listing  is  unnecessarily \ncumbersome and time-consuming, and companies have few incentives to do so. Taxation has \nbeen  a  major  issue,  as  unequal  tax  treatment  of  institutions  has  significantly  affected  the \nparticipation of market intermediaries, especially securities firms. Stock option products were \nlaunched in 2006, but they did not find much favor with the market as the rules were not \nconsidered attractive. \n \n52.  Indonesia\u2019s capital market needs supporting infrastructure. In addition to repurchase \nmarkets  (para.  50),  securities  lending,  margin  trading  (particularly  short  selling),  and  a \nderivatives market need to be developed. The lack of these instruments and facilities reduces \nliquidity and increases transaction costs. Liquidity will also be improved through measures to \nwiden the investor base, in part by encouraging the introduction and issuance of rules for \ndifferent types of products to suit the different risk preferences of investors. These include \nexchange-traded funds, real estate investment trusts, municipal bonds, asset- and mortgage-\nbacked securities, and sharia products. Assistance was also required for the introduction of \nsharia accounting standards for Islamic finance instruments. The collective investment schemes \nhave a highly concentrated market structure with five managers controlling 90% of market. \nBapepam-LK is planning to increase the minimum capital to weed out the smaller participants \nwho  are  not  contributing  to  the  growth  of  the  industry.  Greater  compliance  by  asset \nmanagement firms is expected upon the introduction of the new rule.   \n \n53.  To enhance the performance of the contractual savings industry, pension funds need to  \n                                                 \n21  Straight Through Processing (STP) enables the entire trade process for capital markets and payment transactions \nto be conducted electronically without the need for re-keying or manual intervention, subject to legal and regulatory \nrestrictions. \n ", "18   \nbe allowed to invest in a wider range of domestic instruments. Similarly, market competition \ncould be increased by allowing the participation of more fund mangers who are appropriately \nqualified. The implementation of the new social security system for pension, old age savings, \nand death benefit schemes needs to be expedited through the submission of a white paper that \nwas developed with ADB TA.22  \n \n54.  Mutual exchange structure. The implementation of the merger agreement between the \nJakarta Stock Exchange and Surabaya Stock Exchange, which were merged in September \n2007, has been effectively implemented. The Indonesia Stock Exchange has upgraded to a new \ntrading system in March 2009. The new trading platform replaces the two systems previously \nused at the Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges. Diversification of ownership of the merged \nexchange  will  however  require  amendments  to  the  Capital  Market  Law.  A  comprehensive \nreview  of  all  self-regulatory  organization  activities  and  detailed  measures  for  market \ndevelopment and surveillance also needs to be carried out, including enabling the operation of \nan alternative trading system and electronic communication network (non-exchange trading \nvenues) through the amendments to the Capital Market Law.  \n \n  3.  Improve Market Surveillance and Investor Protection \n \n55.  Regulatory  structure.  A  strong  Bapepam-LK  is  needed  for  a  coherent  policy  and \nregulatory  approach  to  the  capital  markets  and  the  nonbank  financial  sector.  However, \nBapepam-LK is still part of the MOF and does not have the same autonomy or human resource \ncapacity as Bank Indonesia. The Government recognizes the importance of the International \nOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) principles for investor protection as the basis \nfor the development of modern capital markets. In line with these principles, the Government is \ncommitted to enhancing Bapepam-LK\u2019s operational and financial autonomy through appropriate \nlegal and regulatory measures. The initial focus was to establish OJK as an independent body \nby 2010 to supervise capital markets, nonbank financial institutions, and banks through an \noversight board. As originally proposed, the OJK law was to be drafted and submitted to the \nPresident of Indonesia by 30 June 2009. However, the global financial crisis has prompted a \nreassessment of financial regulatory systems worldwide, including in Indonesia. The global \ncrisis has led national authorities\u2014together with regional and global financial institutions\u2014to \nreexamine approaches to financial regulation and supervisory oversight. The combination of \nregulators under one structure has faced major challenges, for example in the United Kingdom. \nThe crisis continues to reshape the global financial architecture, and regulatory overhauls are \nunder discussion worldwide to address apparent weaknesses and gaps.  \n \n56.  The region\u2019s authorities need to strengthen their national regulatory and supervisory \nframeworks, in line with higher regulatory standards emanating from global reforms. Regardless \nof  the  institutional  arrangements  for  supervision\u2014whether  unitary,  \u201ctwin-peaks,\u201d  or  multiple \nsupervisors\u2014legal authority, information sharing, and effective coordination remain essential for \neffective crisis management. Institutional frameworks for financial regulation come in many \nforms,  depending  on  the  different  structures  of  financial  sectors  and  the  stage  of  market \ndevelopment  in  individual  economies.  Little  evidence  has  been  found  that  one  regulatory \nstructure is universally better than the alternatives. Whether a country follows an approach of a \nsingle unified supervisor or several supervisors may not be as critical as having a supervisory \nstructure with clear objectives and supervisors with the authority and legal power to regulate \nand take effective action, especially in resolving financial distress in a coordinated manner. \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Republic of  Indonesia for Financial Governance and Social Security. \nManila.  \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    19 \nRather than rushing through structural reforms, it is appropriate for Indonesia to conduct a \ndetailed review to decide on a regulatory structure that is more integrated and efficient, while \nreducing externalities and enhancing financial stability to minimize systemic risks. In parallel, \nBapepam-LK must have sufficient autonomy and independence for efficient regulation of the \ncapital market and nonbank financial sector. \n \n57.  An amendment to the Capital Market Law is required to give Bapepam-LK staff legal \nimmunity  when  carrying  out  their  supervisory  functions.  Revisions  to  the  Capital  Market, \nPension, and Insurance Laws also need to be accelerated to bring them in compliance with \nIOSCO  principles  for  securities,  International  Association  of  Insurance  Supervisors  core \nprinciples, and OECD guidelines for occupational pensions. \n   \n58.  Regulation and supervision. The legal and regulatory environment for mutual funds \nneeds to be improved. The laws are an amalgam of US regulations for corporate funds (which \ndo not exist in Indonesia) with a few references to contractual funds (i.e., all mutual funds in \nIndonesia).  The  sections  of  the  Capital  Market  Law  that  pertain  to  mutual  funds  and  the \nassociated regulations need to be amended to improve investor confidence and to develop the \nindustry.  Guidelines  on  asset  valuation  and  disclosure  rules  need  to  be  issued  with  the \nprospectus  for  each  investment  fund.  Bapepam-LK\u2019s  investigation  procedures  need  to  be \nstreamlined  and  the  flow  of  information  improved  to  allow  administrative  sanctions  to  be \nimposed more easily. For suspected criminal offenses, better coordination and cooperation with \nthe  judicial  branch  is  needed.  To  strengthen  its  internal  governance  and  accountability, \nBapepam-LK needs to establish an internal compliance bureau with a code of conduct for \nofficials and staff.  \n \n59.  Investor protection. Indonesia does not have an investor protection fund to protect \ninvestors if a broker defaults. The rules require securities firms to take out insurance to cover \nthis eventuality, but such insurance is not available and the rule has not been enforced. This \nlack of insurance exposes investors to significant risk and is likely to deter investors of all sizes \nfrom participating in the market. Such funds are typically built up by contributions from brokers. \n \n60.  International cooperation. Bapepam-LK has entered into bilateral arrangements with \ndomestic and foreign regulators, and has taken steps to seek membership of the IOSCO \nmultilateral memorandum of understanding. However, it is prevented from joining because of a \nlack of legal clarity with regard to its powers to (i) share confidential data with other regulators, \n(ii)  access  bank  records  and  identify  beneficial  ownership  of  shares,  and  (iii)  guarantee \nconfidentiality of requests from foreign regulators. Bapepam-LK needs to initiate the necessary \nsteps to promote regional cooperation by developing action plans to implement the IOSCO \nmemo. Regional integration can facilitate domestic capital market development by providing the \nliquidity, scale, and capacity to compete globally and manage volatility more effectively (para. \n35). Bilateral MOUs with foreign capital markets regulators will help strengthen information \nsharing.   \n \n61.  Risk-based  supervision  in  contractual  savings  industry  and  minimum  capital \nrequirements. In 2000, Indonesia became the first country in Asia to implement modern risk-\nbased capital requirements for life and general insurers. The Bureau of Insurance has been \nmoving toward risk-based supervision, although more rapid progress is needed. Implementation \nof risk-based capital regulations need to be reviewed and corporate governance standards \nenforced.  The  pension  industry  also  needs  to  move  toward  risk-based  supervision.  To \nstrengthen  and  consolidate  the  insurance  sector,  an  increase  in  the  minimum  capital \n ", "20   \nrequirement levels for both non-life and life insurers from the current Rp40 billion has been \nconsidered in line with international standards. \n \n4.  Improve Governance and Human Resource Capacity \n \n62.  Strengthen  financial  sector  risk  management  through  coordination  among \nregulators. If there is more than one regulator, each needs to have clear and precise objectives, \nbe  subject  to  extensive  disclosure  requirements,  and  be  publicly  accountable.  Adequate \narrangements, preferably documented, are also needed to ensure the regulators cooperate \nwhen necessary, and that they have powers to exchange relevant information. Incentives for \nregulatory  arbitrage  should  be  recognized  and  minimized,  and  regulatory  gaps  should  be \nspotted and filled at an early stage. Formal coordination between Bank Indonesia, the MOF, and \nthe Deposit Insurance Institution needs to be clearly outlined to prevent potential risks to the \nsystem\u2019s stability. A financial sector assessment program to allow for comprehensive and up-to-\ndate diagnosis of financial sector vulnerabilities is overdue.  \n \n63.  Anti-Money-Laundering  Regime.  While  considerable  progress  has  been  made  in \nstrengthening the anti-money-laundering regime for the banking sector, the nonbank financial \nsector lags in terms of the effectiveness of regulations and supervision, as well as in the \ncapacity  of  institutions  to  comply  with  the  law.  To  reduce  the  risk  of  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions being used for money laundering, regulations, supervision (capacity, enforcement \npowers, and sanctions), and capacity for compliance will need to be strengthened to achieve \nparity with the banking sector.  \n \n64.  Institutional Capacity. Bapepam-LK will require support over the medium term for it to \nbecome  an  effective  regulator.  Governance  of  regulatory  agencies  and  market  institutions \nrequires  staff  with  graduate  level  education  in  actuarial  science  and  finance,  as  well  as \nexperience in regulatory practices and market surveillance in developed markets. Acquiring \nthese skills is a precondition for success, but the Government will have to commit adequate \nresources  over  the  medium  and  long  term  if  technical  and  regulatory  excellence  is  to  be \nachieved. \n \nC.  Lessons \n \n65.  ADB\u2019s financial sector interventions in Indonesia. In addition to subprogram 1 under \nthe  CMDPC,  ADB  has  undertaken  four  major  financial  sector  operations  in  Indonesia \naddressing banking, capital markets, pensions, and insurance over the past two decades. The \nthrust of financial sector reforms over this period moved from deregulation of the banking sector \nand capital market to implementation of a comprehensive set of reforms aimed at strengthening \npotential safeguards while encouraging market forces and market efficiency. The rapid growth \nthat occurred after deregulation and the subsequent problems in the banking sector highlighted \ninadequacies  in  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory  frameworks,  while  underpinning  the \nimportance of a long-term approach to strengthening capacity. \n \n66.  Continuing support through technical assistance.  ADB TA (footnote 7) focused on \nstrengthening Bapepam-LK. It supported the preparation of a nonbank financial sector action \nplan, an assessment of Indonesian standards in meeting IOSCO principles for capital market \nregulation, and an evaluation of training needs within Bapepam-LK. The TA has also supported \nthe development of the bond market, improvements to the research and surveillance functions \nof Bapepam-LK, and the preparation of regulations and guidelines for Islamic financial products. \nFollow-up TA support (footnote 2) for implementation of reforms and policy actions under the \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    21 \nProgram was attached to subprogram 1. The TA is being used to develop the capacity within \nBapepam-LK. \n    \n67.  Lessons learned. Broad-based reforms require long-term institutional development and \nmust  be  fully  aligned  with  the  Government\u2019s  national  and  sector  development  plans.  The \nCMDPC  comprising  subprogram  1  and  subprogram  2  was  developed  on  this  basis  to  be \nimplemented from 2006 to 2010. The program cluster is considered a useful approach in this \nregard, as it combines a long-term view covering a wide range of policy and institutional reforms \nwith the flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances. Policy actions initiated under subprogram \n1 will be maintained and pursued to completion through proposed follow-up actions under \nsubprogram 2. It allows the gradual introduction of critical components in the sector, including a \ncomprehensive  legal  framework  and  an  action  plan.  Program  clusters  can  also  enable \nbenchmarks to be established and unify policy makers who advocate reforms. The program \ncompletion  report 23  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Social  Security  Reform  Program \nrecommended a framework based on single-tranche programs within a program loan cluster to \nprovide more flexibility while focusing on achievable, upfront outcomes. Much of the success of \nsuch an approach will depend on the commitment by stakeholders. The Indonesia country \nassistance program evaluation24 noted that the ADB financial sector projects and programs have \ngenerally performed well.  \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \n68.  The  accomplishments  since  subprogram  1  (Table  3)  have  exceeded  some  of  the \nperformance indicators originally envisaged in the design and monitoring framework (DMF) for \nthe  CMDPC  and  fully  justify  subprogram  2.  The  DMF  has  been  revised  to  reflect  these \nachievements  (Appendix  1).  The  indicative  policy  actions  adopted  for  subprogram  2  while \nprocessing subprogram 1 in 2007 and their links to the proposed subprogram 2 is in Appendix 4.  \n    \nTable 3: Accomplishments since Subprogram 1  \nIndicators  2006  July 2009  Increase (%) \nMarket capitalization (Rp trillion)a   1,249.10  1,875.04   50 \nInvestors a   215,025  339,352  58 \n(Dec 07)  \nListed companies a  344  404   18 \nMutual fund unit holders  197,380  351,489  78 \nForeign mutual fund unit holders  5,611  6,003  7 \nAssets of pension funds (Rp billion) a  74,806  86,007  15 \nTrading cost (basis points)  72  52.98  26 \n(reduction) \n(i) New products introduced such as Asset Backed Exchange Traded Fund, sharia-compliant \nsecurities \n(ii) Enhanced trading system infrastructure in stock exchange \n(iii) Setting up of Capital Market Institute to lead to improved quality of industry professionals \n(iv) Enhanced Institutional Capacity in Bapepam-LK  \n(v) Infrastructure Financing Company to be set up in 2009 to provide long-term financing \n     a Exceeded targets set under the design and monitoring framework during subprogram 1. \n     Source:  Bapepam-LK. \n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n \n ", "22   \nA.  Program Design \n \n69.  The Government recognizes that the Indonesian capital market needs to be enhanced \nby strengthening the institutions and the regulatory policy framework. In 2007, subprogram 1 \nidentified  a  strong  need  to  strengthen  transparency  and  information  disclosure,  which  are \nessential  to  building  confidence  in  capital  markets  and  institutions,  facilitating  regulatory \noversight, and promoting price discovery and market liquidity. Both supply and demand sides of \nfinancial markets needed to be addressed. On the supply side, a sequence of measures was \nneeded to deepen government bond markets and develop the short-term and interbank money \nmarkets as the essential building block for the development of corporate bond markets. On the \ndemand side, broadening the investor base through the promotion of institutional investors, \nsuch as contractual savings and collective investor schemes, is required. To enable markets to \nfunction with sufficient speed, efficiency, and accountability, the underlying micro-structure for \ntrading  securities  needed  to  be  strengthened.  The  operational  and  financial  autonomy  of \nregulatory and supervisory authorities also needed to be strengthened with a view to ensuring \ninvestor protection. As a result, a policy reform program initiated with two subprograms was \nproposed to begin addressing these issues from January 2006 to August 2009. The initial \nsuccess of the reforms under subprogram 1 has fully justified the development of subprogram 2. \nWhile subprogram 1 covered January 2006 to September 2007, subprogram 2 covers October \n2007 to August 2009. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n70.    The impact of subprogram 2 as part of the overall impact of CMDPC will be greater \nfinancial  sector  diversification  and  resilience.  The  CMDPC  has  been  embedded  in  the \nGovernment's medium-term reform agenda. The outcome of the CMDPC is greater contribution \nby the capital market to domestic financing.  Towards this end, CMDPC will support accelerated \ncapital  market  growth  to  enable  more  diversification  of  markets  combined  with  stronger \nregulatory and supervisory capacity to ensure resilience of the financial sector that will promote \neconomic development. The CMDPC is expected to lead to an increase in the nonbank financial \nsector\u2019s share of total financial assets. \n \nC.  Policy Framework and Accomplished Actions \n \n71.  The  policy  measures  supported  by  the  CMDPC  include  a  set  of  sector  reforms  to \npromote financial diversification by enhancing the growth and development of capital markets. \nThe reform agenda is structured around the following policy outcomes, which form the basis of \nthe four components of the CMDPC: \n(i)  enhancing information disclosure and price discovery, \n(ii)  promoting deeper and more liquid financial markets, \n(iii)  improving market surveillance and investor protection, and \n(iv)  strengthening governance and human resource capacity. \n \n1.  Enhancing Information Disclosure and Improving Price Discovery \n \n72.  Bapepam-LK has issued rules requiring prompt disclosure of secondary trading in bonds \nunder subprogram 1, while requiring issuers of bonds to have an annual rating of outstanding \nsecurities.  With  this  disclosure,  the  market  valuation  of  fixed-income  instruments  can  be \nachieved. To this end, Bapepam-LK issued regulations to establish a bond pricing agency \n(BPA) in the private sector. Under subprogram 2, the BPA has become operational as an \nindependent  market-neutral  entity  to  provide  fair  valuation  of  fixed-income  instruments. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    23 \nMoreover, all issuers and public companies were required under subprogram 1 to provide \nadditional information on corporate governance as part of their annual reports. To improve \nmarket transparency, Bapepam-LK has issued directives under subprogram 2 for prompt public \ndisclosure of changes in beneficial ownership beyond 5% in the shareholding of any listed \ncompany. \n \n2.        Promoting Deeper and More Liquid Financial Markets \n \n73.  The supply and demand sides are important, as is the underlying micro-structure, for \ntrading of securities. On the supply side, the Government has adopted a series of measures \nunder  subprogram  1  and  2  to  develop  deeper  and  more  liquid  securities  markets,  most \nimportantly at the short end of the market. Benchmark yields for government bonds are being \ndeveloped by concentrating the issuance of government bonds at the selected maturities of 5, 7, \n10, 15, 20, and 30 years. This has been improved further under subprogram 2 where the DMO \ndirectorate general issues regular updates to the annual auction calendar to provide market \nparticipants with more clarity on issuance expectations. The primary dealer system has been \nestablished with market making responsibilities in government debt securities to ensure two-way \nquotes and to support the development of its secondary market. To develop the short-term \ngovernment  debt  market,  treasury  bills  of  9\u201312  months  maturity  have  been  issued.  The \nGovernment will gradually progress issuance of treasury bills down to 1 month maturity with the \nlonger-term objective of replacing short-term bills issued by Bank Indonesia. The DMO issued \nits first 3-month bills in February 2009. \n \n74.  Secondary  market liquidity has been enhanced under subprogram 2 through better \ncoordination between Bapepam-LK and Bank Indonesia. In coordination with Bapepam-LK, the \nDMO directorate general, the tax directorate general, and market participants, Bank Indonesia \nhas initiated a comprehensive review of the legal and business requirements for adoption of the \nGeneral Master Repurchase (Repo) Agreement. It is also developing a centralized borrowing \nand lending program for government bonds. The monitoring of the operations of the primary \ndealer has improved under subprogram 2 to ensure that the market making commitments are \nbeing carried out and obligations to provide the two-way quotes are being met. Steps have been \ninitiated to improve the clearing and settlement infrastructure under subprogram 2, moving \ntowards continuous settlement. Revisions in rules and regulations on short selling and margin \ntrading were issued in June 2008 supported under subprogram 2. Infrastructure development \nhas been facilitated through the amendment of Presidential Decree 61/1998 in 2009 to allow the \nestablishment  of  finance  companies  to  provide  long-term  financing  for  infrastructure,  thus \ndeepening the debt market.  \n \n75.  On the supply side, government bonds have been issued in small denominations in a \nsuccessful appeal to the retail public. In parallel, rules were issued under subprogram 1 to \nfacilitate the issuance of new products, such as municipal bonds, sharia-based instruments, \nexchange traded funds, and securitization of asset-backed receivables such as mortgages. \nOther than municipal bonds, these new products were offered during subprogram 2. Steps have \nbeen initiated under subprogram 2 to introduce hedging instruments, such as stock options and \nindex-based futures. The development of the housing finance industry has been another priority \nwith amendments to the Presidential Decree No.19 of 2005 to enable PT Sarana Multigriya \nFinansial, the secondary mortgage finance institution, to lend up to 15 years to develop the \ncritical mass of primary mortgage receivables. This measure is expected to eventually lead to \nthe development of a secondary market for securitization of mortgage receivables. Other new \nproducts, such as sharia-compliant government bonds (sukuks) and Asset-Backed Exchange \nTraded Fund, were developed and issued during subprogram 2. \n ", "24   \n76.  The infrastructure\u2014or micro-structure\u2014for market trading is being enhanced. Screen-\nbased trading has been introduced countrywide. The merger of the two stock exchanges in \nJakarta supported under subprogram 1 is supporting further developments in this area. This is \nexpected to lead to better governance of the stock exchange, while broadening ownership and \nintegrating offerings of debt and equity securities. The implementation of the merger agreement \nof  the  two  exchanges  was  completed  under  subprogram  2,  while  the  proposal  for \ndemutualization of the merged exchange will be initiated through the proposed amendments to \nthe  Capital  Market  Law.  Government  regulation  25/2009  (March)  provides  for  same  tax \ntreatment for sharia-based products as conventional transactions. Distortions and preferential \ntreatment for mutual funds on income derived from fixed-income securities have been removed. \nMoreover, to promote more listing and float in the securities market, tax incentives have been \nprovided,  effective  January  2008,  through  the  issuance  of  a  decree.  Bapepam-LK  is \nprogressively adopting international financial reporting standards. \n \n  3.         Improving Market Surveillance and Investor Protection \n \n77.  Subprogram 1 supported the development and submission to the Minister of Finance of \na proposal for an appropriate regulatory structure for the capital markets and the nonbank \nfinancial institutions supervisory agency. This was to be independent of the MOF, but reporting \nto the minister, with powers to recruit staff outside the civil service code. To establish OJK as an \nindependent body to supervise capital markets, nonbank financial institutions, and banks with \nan oversight board, a draft OJK law was being developed for submission to the President of \nIndonesia by 30 June 2009. Given the implications of the global financial crisis and the need for \na more detailed study on an appropriate regulatory structure (paras. 55\u201356), subprogram 2 \nsupported the establishment of a task force in August 2009, comprising senior officials of \nBapepam-LK and Bank Indonesia. This review will consider different options on regulatory \nstructures,  including  separating  the  monetary  policy  and  supervisory  functions  in  Bank \nIndonesia. The study is expected to be completed by the end of 2009. Irrespective of the \nstructure that is adopted, the aim will be to empower Bapepam-LK with more autonomy and \nindependence by separating it from the MOF (but reporting to the minister of finance) in early \n2010. Amendments to the three sector laws (capital markets, pensions, and insurance), which \nParliament  was  to  consider  after  the  OJK,  were  drafted  during  subprogram  2  and  made \navailable for public comments. Submission to the President is targeted by the end of April 2010. \nDrafts will allow for greater compliance with international best practices and principles (IOSCO), \nOECD, International Association Insurance Supervisors, and Bank for International Settlements. \nAll draft sector laws will (i) provide indemnity for staff for official acts done in good faith, (ii) \nrequire better governance by market participants, and (iii) strengthen enforcement powers. The \nproposed measures for greater operational and financial autonomy will be accompanied by \nenhanced accountability. The follow-up actions, including the submission of the above sector \nlaws  to  the  President  and  then  to  Parliament  will  be  monitored  through  the  post-program \nmonitoring framework (para. 83). \n \n78.  Risk-based supervision has been extended under subprogram 2 to all institutions in the \ncapital markets and the contractual savings industries. Subprogram 2 supported the issuance of \nrules in 2008 requiring an increase in minimum equity for insurance companies from Rp40 \nbillion to Rp100 billion, and for reinsurance companies from Rp100 billion to Rp200 billion \nduring a transition period from 2010 to 2014. Based on the feasibility study carried out under \nsubprogram 1, an implementation plan was developed under subprogram 2 for establishing an \ninvestor protection fund by 2010-2012 in consultation with the brokerages.  \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    25 \n79.  Under subprogram 2, IDX has also entered into bilateral MOUs (drafted by Indonesia) \nwith five other participating ASEAN exchanges as part of regional commitment to set up an \nASEAN trading board, which will involve 30 stocks from each participating stock exchange \nimplemented through a common exchange gateway.   \n \n  4.         Improving Governance and Human Resource Capacity \n \n80.  The Government has initiated the Financial Sector Assessment Program evaluation \n(with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank) to allow for comprehensive and up-to-\ndate diagnosis of financial sector vulnerabilities. This was initiated during subprogram 2. \n \n81.  Under subprogram 2, an awareness raising and training program for regulated entities in \nthe nonbank financial sector was conducted to strengthen their capacity to comply with anti-\nmoney-laundering responsibilities. \"Know-your-customer\" rules were strengthened for nonbank \nfinancial institutions under subprogram 1, while the capacity within nonbank financial institutions \nis further strengthened under subprogram 2 to improve compliance with anti-money-laundering \nregulations.  \n \n82.  Efforts to strengthen the human resources in the capital markets that was initiated under \nsubprogram 1 was further broadened under subprogram 2 with Bapepam-LK studying a number \nof  options  including  developing  and  adopting  a  plan  of  collaboration  with  universities  in \nIndonesia to serve the research needs of the capital markets and the contractual savings \nindustries. An important milestone was the MOU signed under subprogram 2 in 2009 to initiate \nthe Capital Markets Institute cooperatively by IDX, KPEI, KSEI, University of Indonesia, and \nBapepam-LK  to  provide  a  focus  for  undergraduate,  graduate,  and  professional  training  to \ndevelop  the  capital  markets.  Bapepam-LK  has  also  adopted  a  medium-term  plan  to \ndevelop regulatory information and the research capability at Bapepam-LK to meet current and \nfuture needs. In addition to the ADB TA under the Program, the Government is committed to \nallocating through its normal budgetary process $18 million during 2008\u20132012 to meet capacity \nbuilding needs in the area of capital markets and nonbank financial institutions (e.g., support for \nsecondments, specialized recruitment and advanced training, specialized training, and support \nthrough academic institutions) to move towards achieving technical regulatory excellence. With \nwell-trained  regulators,  regulatory  implementation  and  effectiveness  will  be  substantially \nenhanced. \n \n83.  Post-program  monitoring  framework.  The  Government  has  recognized  that  the \ncapital market reform program would need to extend beyond the two subprograms under the \nCMDPC.  As  such,  a  post-program  monitoring  framework  for  follow-up  policy  actions  for \nSeptember  2009\u2013June  2011  has  been  developed  in  consultation  with  various  agencies \n(Appendix 4). This policy matrix will eventually be used as the basis for the follow-up program \nproposed in the 2011\u20132012 pipeline. A completion report for evaluating the accomplishments \nunder the CMDPC is also proposed in 2010. \n \nTable 4: Post-Program Monitoring Framework for Follow-Up Policy Measures \nNO.

Important Features \n \n84.  The CMDPC has a number of distinct and innovative features. First, the Government is \nstrongly committed to the development of capital markets through the CMMP and the FSPP. \nThese initiatives represent a combination of economic, business, legal, and regulatory factors \ndesigned to enhance the role of Indonesia's capital market in contributing to financial sector \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    27 \nresilience and as an engine of accelerated economic growth. Second, the CMDPC supports \nqualitative changes in reform processes to ensure effective implementation for results-based \noutcomes. CMDPC focuses on outcomes and allows for greater flexibility in actions necessary \nto achieve compliance. Third, it is predicated on the need for a policy and institutional response \nto significant market developments since the completion of the subprogram 1. Fourth, the \nCMDPC has helped establish a program coordination committee that will be responsible for \nimplementing  the  action  plan  adopted  for  the  CMMP  and  the  FSPP.  Fifth,  it  includes  an \nindicative  policy  reform  agenda  for  the  follow-up  program  in  2011\u20132012  that  builds  upon \nsubprogram 1 and 2 reforms, thus providing for flexibility in developing future programs. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n85.  The gross financing needs of the Government have increased from $18.2 billion in 2008 \nto $25.8 billion in 2009 based on the revised 2009 budget that included the fiscal stimulus to \nrespond to the global financial crisis. These growing financing needs reflect higher levels of \ndomestic and foreign debt principal repayments and changes to the 2009 budget. The revised \n2009 budget projects a lower increase in revenues because of the economic slowdown, and the \nneed for additional spending to stimulate the economy in 2009 and to fund poverty reduction \nprograms. The revised budget protects social sector spending, particularly education and the \nflagship  community-based  poverty  reduction  program,  to  provide  a  cushion  for  adversely \naffected  households.  Overall,  the  Government  is  budgeting  for  additional  spending  and \ncountercyclical spending of up to Rp73.2 trillion in 2009. Its financing plan (Table 5) indicates \nthat gross financing requirements of $25.8 billion will be met from the following sources: (i) \n$13.8 billion from the issuance of domestic and international bond bonds, (ii) $5.4 billion from \nthe  banking  system  and  excess  financing  from  2008,  and  (iii)  $6.6  billion  from  official \ndevelopment  assistance  and  project  lending.  The  Government  will  draw  down  the  Public \nExpenditure Support Facility (footnote 4) and related support from other development partners \nwhen it cannot meet its financing targets from the markets within market access conditions \nspecified in the Government\u2019s financing plan and other conditions set out in the related loan \nagreement.  \n \nTable 5: Projected Financing Requirements of the Government of Indonesia, 2009 \n($ billion) \n     Proposed \nFinancing Mix     Amount \nGross Financing Requirements    25.77 \nLess Amortization   12.15 \n   \nNet Financing Requirement          13.62 \nProgrammed Gross External Borrowings            6.60 \nof which:   \nADB\u2019s Proposed Loan Pipeline            0.75 \nDevelopment Policy Support Program             0.20 \nIndonesia Infrastructure Financing Facility            0.10 \nCapital Market Development (Subprogram 2)            0.30  \nNational Community Empowerment Project    0.07 \nMetropolitan Sanitation Project   0.05 \nJava Bali Distribution  Performance Improvement    0.04 \nOther Funding Agencies and Commercial Borrowings             5.85 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nNote: Exchange rate: $1 = Rp 10,500. \nSources: Ministry of Finance and ADB estimates. \n \n86.  The  proposed  single-tranche  loan  for  subprogram  2  of  $300  million  will  help  the \nGovernment meet its financing needs. The loan will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \n ", "28   \nresources. It will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, and a commitment charge of 0.15% per year.25  \n \n87.  The size of the proposed loan is based on (i) the economic importance of the financial \nsector, (ii) the significance of the proposed reforms over the medium term, (iii) the CMDPC\u2019s \ndevelopment impact, and (iv) the Government\u2019s overall financing needs for the fiscal stimulus to \nmeet the international credit crisis. Market forces need an effective and transparent regulatory \nframework. In the absence of timely reforms, the financial sector will continue to be ineffective in \nintermediating resources for productive investment, financial institutions will remain vulnerable \nto systemic risks, and investors will be vulnerable to fraud and misconduct. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n88.  Bapepam-LK has been the Executing Agency for subprogram 2 and has monitored and \nfacilitated the implementation of the agreed upon reform actions to ensure that they have been \ncarried  out  in  a  timely  manner.  The  implementing  agencies  have  been  Bank  Indonesia; \nBapepam-LK, Debt Management Office (DMO), the Directorate of Taxes (DOT), all three under \nthe Ministry of Finance; and the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX). Bapepam-LK established a \nprogram coordination committee chaired by the Bapepam-LK with representatives from Bank \nIndonesia, Bappenas (National Development Planning Agency), DMO, DOT, and IDX. The \ncommittee  has  been  responsible  for  coordinating  the  implementation  program  actions  and \nsustaining them. The committee has overseen the implementation of the policy actions detailed \nin the policy letter and the policy matrix, and has provided guidance and direction to Bapepam-\nLK, the implementing agencies, and other line agencies of the Borrower.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period  \n \n89.  The implementation period for subprogram 2 has been from October 2007 to August \n2009. The Government has completed all actions in the policy matrix for subprogram 2. In \naddition,  a  post-program  monitoring  framework  has  been  adopted  by  the  Government  in \npartnership with ADB for September 2009\u2013June 2011. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n90.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \nduties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items, and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998), the reimbursement procedure will be used to disburse \nthe loan proceeds based on certification by the Borrower. No supporting import documentation \nwill be required if during each year the value of Indonesia\u2019s total imports minus imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nsuch year. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal \n                                                 \n25 There will be no commitment charge for the single-tranche loan if it is declared effective and disbursed within \n60 days after the signing of the Loan Agreement.  \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    29 \nrequest. Otherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Assessment \n \n91.   ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the Government and Bapepam-LK. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n92.  The proposed subprogram 2 directly addresses anticorruption issues in the financial \nsector  through  its  core  focus  on  strengthening  protection  for  investors  against  fraud  and \nmisrepresentation. This is part of a broader Government agenda to fight corruption and improve \nits  public  financial  management  systems.  Presidential  Decree  80/2003  sets  out  the  basic \nprinciples of procurement: transparency, open and fair competition, economy, and efficiency. \nSeveral state auxiliary bodies have been established with mandates to fight corruption: the \nCommission for Eradication of Corruption, the National Ombudsman Commission, the National \nLaw  Commission,  and  the  Commission  for  the  Eradication  of  Money  Laundering.26 The \nCorruption  Eradication  Commission  has  effectively  prosecuted  some  high-ranking  officials. \nFurther, the DPSP cluster (footnotes 8 and 9) had a core focus on improving governance and \nanticorruption initiatives. It promotes transparency in public finance management and aims to \nstrengthen the independent oversight mechanisms by improving the auditing framework. The \nGovernment has reorganized MOF, separating the budget and treasury functions. It has also \ninitiated  steps  to  increase  efficiency  and  transparency,  and  to  reduce  corruption  in  public \nfinance management. The Government emphasizes strengthening internal control systems and \noverall public finance management, with support from the World Bank.27  \n \n93.  An update of the country\u2019s financial management systems assessment also draws on \nrecent economic and sector work undertaken by the World Bank and ADB.28 It is also anchored \non the results of a public expenditure and financial assessment concluded in June 2008.29 \nBased on this assessment, the fiduciary arrangements proposed for subprogram 2 remain \nacceptable.  Since  1997,  substantial  progress  has  been  made  in  improving  the  regulatory \nframework for improved public financial management, under three laws (The Law on State \nFinance, The State Treasury Law, and the State Audit Law), and the other complementary laws \non planning and procurement, and related implementing regulations. The Fiscal Policy Office \nwithin  MOF  has  a  mandate  to  undertake  macro-fiscal  projections  and  analysis.  Budget \ndocumentation and disclosures to the public have improved. A fiscal risk statement is now \nincluded in the annual budget documents, making Indonesia one of the pioneers in fiscal risk \nanalysis among emerging market economies. A more recent focus has been on improving \n                                                 \n26 ADB has been closely involved in the establishment and strengthening of the anti-money-laundering regime in \nIndonesia through TA support as well as policy-based loans. \n27 The Government Financial Management and Revenue Administration Project was approved in December 2004. \n28 ADB. 2007.

The 2007 government cash management regulations \ncontributed to consolidating government bank accounts, and also improved cash management \nby  including  off-budget  accounts  in  the  single  treasury  account.  Major  public  financial \nmanagement  reforms  are  underway  in  Indonesia  including  medium-term  expenditure \nframework,  program,  and  performance  budgeting;  and  the  modernization  of  the  treasury \nsystem, including a financial management information system. Other complementary measures \ninclude unification of the planning and budgeting processes, revised chart of accounts and \nbudget classification, new treasury processes, and improved auditing. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n94.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe  Government\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment will nominate an account (the deposit account) at Bank Indonesia to receive the \nloan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms \nsatisfactory to ADB. Bapepam-LK will submit progress reports on policy and institutional reform \nimplementation to the program coordination committee and ADB. These will be submitted in \nsuch form and in such detail as ADB may request, and should include (i) progress made and \nproblems encountered during the period in review, (ii) steps taken or proposed to be taken to \nremedy problems encountered, (iii) proposed detailed activities for program implementation, and \n(iv) expected progress based on (ii) and (iii) above. \n \n6.  Counterpart Funds \n \n95.  Counterpart funds generated by subprogram 2 will be used by the Government, under \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  meet program  expenditures  and  associated  costs  of \nreform  and  additional  budgetary  allocation  for  the  fiscal  stimulus  program  to  address  the \ninternational credit crisis.  \n \n7.  Monitoring and Review \n \n96.  ADB will, in cooperation with MOF and Bapepam-LK, carry out periodic reviews of \nprogress and outcomes of subprogram 2 after it is completed. The Government will keep ADB \ninformed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that \nhave implications for program implementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to \ncomment on any resulting policy proposals. ADB, in collaboration with MOF and Bapepam-LK, \nwill review program performance about 6 months after loan effectiveness to review the outcome \nof subprogram 2. In addition to the progress reports, MOF and Bapepam-LK will submit within \n30 days of the subprogram 2 review by ADB a report that will evaluate the implementation of the \npolicy  reform  measures  under  subprogram  2.  To  enable  the  processing  of  the  program \nenvisaged in 2011\u20132012, this report will also assess the impact on the sector, describe lessons \nidentified  during  the  program  period,  and  outline  reforms  and  assistance  needed  for  the \ndevelopment of the sector. \n \nVI.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n97.     A TA is being processed separately to support the continuation of the reforms beyond \nthe CMDPC, including the policy measures included in the post-program monitoring framework. \nThe TA will lead to a deeper and more resilient capital market, and better supervision with \nimproved regulatory resources and capacity. Through the proposed technical support, overall \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    31 \ngovernance standards and investor protection will be improved. To attain these objectives, the \nkey activities targeted are (i) supporting regulatory reforms identified following the Financial \nSector  Assessment  Program;  (ii)  supporting  implementation  of  CMMP  (2010\u20132014);  (iii) \nstrengthening the enforcement resource capability of Bapepam-LK; (iv) further benchmarking of \nthe  regulatory  framework  for  harmonization  of  standards  and  regional  cooperation;  (v) \nestablishing an investor protection fund for the securities market; (vi) developing a structured \napproach to fully implement capacity building of human resources of Bapepam-LK, including the \nestablishment of the Capital Markets Institute; (vii) developing a comprehensive capital markets \ndatabase  for  public  information  services  and  the  promotion  of  market  transparency;  (viii) \nformulating  a  comprehensive  compliance  framework  for  capital  market  intermediaries;  (ix) \nsupporting the development of new products such as mortgage credit insurance and other risk \nmitigation products; and (x) supporting insurance industry consolidation. These activities are \nessential to promote capital market resilience, growth, and sustainability. \n \nVII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n98.  The CMDPC is providing a policy framework that encourages financial innovation in \nterms of new capital market instruments, longer tenors, and new kinds of intermediation\u2014all \ncritical for infrastructure financing. It will enhance information disclosure and facilitate price \ndiscovery, thus improving the efficiency of financial markets in pricing risk. This will help to \ncreate deeper and more liquid capital markets. In particular, subprogram 2 will also promote \nstronger intermediaries that are better able to mobilize and allocate resources and risks. Better \nmarket  surveillance  and  investor  protection  will  promote  stability  and  resilience,  and  are \nessential  for  capital  market  development.  To  maintain  the  momentum  in  reforms,  the \nGovernment proposes to have in place the CMMP for 2010\u20132014, developed through ADB TA, \nby end 2009 and implemented through a TA that is being separately processed. Together with \nbroader economic reforms in Indonesia, the reform of capital markets will contribute to financial \nsector stability, productivity growth, and employment generation. \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n \n99.  Subprogram 2 did not entail any involuntary resettlement or have a negative impact on \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement, \nthe impact on indigenous people, and the impact on the environment. Subprogram 2 was a \ngeneral intervention aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth and is expected to have \nan indirect positive effect on poverty reduction. The summary poverty and social impact analysis \nis in Appendix 6; the environmental impact analysis is in Appendix 7. \n \nC.  Risks  \n \n100.  The assumptions underlying subprogram 2 included the following: \n(i)  The economy will withstand the direct adverse effects of the ongoing global \nfinancial crisis, both the decline in economic activity and the distortions created in \nIndonesian financial markets.  \n(ii)  The needed political will and commitment to pursue capital market reforms will \ncontinue. \n \n101.  While mitigation measures have been put in place for some of the key risks anticipated, \nthe subprogram 2 did face some risks:  \n ", "32   \n \n(i)  Implications of global financial crisis and external vulnerabilities. The main \nrisk from the global financial crisis has been the possibility of capital outflows that \ncould  have  affected  the  financial  sector.  During  2005\u20132007  Indonesian \nmacroeconomic  indicators  have  improved  significantly,  which  translates  into \nbetter resilience to external shocks. However, Indonesian residents can switch to \nforeign assets easily, and there are significant foreign holdings, especially in the \nstock market and government bonds. Thus, Indonesia has been vulnerable to \nsudden shifts in investor sentiments. The Government will also have larger gross \nfinancing needs over the next 2 years, and the availability and cost of this gross \nfinancing poses risks. Stronger macroeconomic performance, a high degree of \npolicy  continuity,  better  fiscal  performance,  and  improved  liquidity  in  global \nfinancial market have mitigated these risks. \n(ii)  Fiduciary  and  reputational  risks.  Civil  society  groups  have  also  raised \nconcerns  about  the  proper  use  of  development  partner  funds.  Despite \nconsiderable  improvements  in  the  fiduciary  environment  in  Indonesia  since \n2000\u20132001, risks had remained. Indonesia has a public sector institutional reform \nagenda  aiming  to  address  concerns  over  the  quality  of  its  public  financial \nmanagement  procedures  and  processes.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Government \nFinancial  Management  and  Revenue  Administration  Project  and  other \ndevelopment  partner  programs  are  helping  the  Government  to  lock  in  and \nimplement institutional reforms in public financial management. \n(iii)  Sustaining reforms. The financial and operational autonomy of Bapepam-LK, \nwhich is essential for its effective supervision of the nonbank financial sector, will \nneed an appropriate regulatory framework. Vested or competing interests might \nhave opposed reforms being undertaken by the Government. The consolidation \nof reform initiatives in recent years, and the commitment by the Government to \ncontinue with reforms has ensured Indonesia is on the path to renewed rapid \ngrowth and accelerated poverty reduction.  \n(iv)  Governance and capacity constraints. Unless institutional and human capacity \ndevelopment  had  been  fostered  within  Bapepam-LK,  the  implementation  of \nreforms might have been delayed. TA will help address Bapepam-LK\u2019s capacity \nweaknesses. In addition, the Government has agreed to commit, through its \nnormal budgetary processes, expanded provisions for human development to \nsustain  capacity  building  efforts  over  the  medium  and  long  term.  ADB  has \nprovided support for anticorruption measures, including procurement reforms, \nduring the past 7 years, and a number of ongoing activities funded by ADB have \nan  anticorruption  and  capacity  building  focus.  ADB  has  also  supported  the \nPartnership  for  Governance  Reform\u2014a  cooperative  relationship  between  the \nGovernment,  civil  society,  the  private  sector,  and  international  development \npartners on governance reform.  \n(v)  Enforcement  constraints.  Bapepam-LK  continued  to  have  difficulty \nimplementing its compliance and enforcement mandate effectively. The CMDPC \nhas  helped  to  strengthen  its  investigation  strategies  and  enforcement  skills \nthrough clearly defined capacity building programs within Bapepam-LK. \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                                    33 \nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n \n \n102.  In addition to the implementation of the actions specified in the policy matrix and to the \nstandard assurances, the Government has given the following specific assurances, which are \nincorporated in the Loan Agreement.  \n \n(i)  Continuity and coordination of reforms. The Government will carry out the \npolicies and actions in accordance with the schedule of policy reforms contained \nin  the  policy  matrix  and  ensure  sustainability  of  the  reforms  beyond  the \nsubprogram 2 period. \n(ii)  Policy dialogue. The Government will keep ADB informed of (a) the progress \nmade in carrying out the reforms beyond the CMDPC, from time to time, and (b) \nthe policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have \nimplications for implementation of subprogram 2 or the post-program monitoring \nframework and will provide ADB with an opportunity to comment on any resulting \npolicy  proposals.  The  Government  will  take  ADB\u2019s  views  into  consideration \nbefore finalizing and implementing any such proposals. \n(iii)  Counterpart  funds.  The Government will use the local currency counterpart \nfunds  generated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures  and \nassociated  costs  of  reform  and  additional  budgetary  allocation  for  the  fiscal \nstimulus program to address the international credit crisis.  \n \nIX.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n103.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board  \napprove the loan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 2 of the Capital \nMarket Development Program Cluster from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n          C.

Regional Comparison of Indonesia's Financial System \n1.  In terms of composition and growth, Indonesia\u2019s financial system has not progressed \nmuch since 2005 compared with those of its neighbors. Although the Indonesian capital market \nhad been the best performing in the region, its breadth and depth and enforcement of regulation \nand supervision still need to be addressed. The long-term debt market had been constrained by \ndelays in pension and insurance sector reforms. Much liquidity was locked up in government \nbonds. In 2008, with total banking assets as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) of \n43.8%, Indonesia had the smallest market in this region. With equity market capitalization as a \npercentage of GDP of 21.8% in 2008\u2014it dipped because of the global crisis but has since \nimproved\u2014Indonesia had the smallest market, with Hong Kong, China ahead of the pack, \nfollowed by Singapore, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, People's Republic of China, the Philippines, \nand Thailand. Indonesia also had the smallest debt market of the countries in Table 2 of the \nmain text with the percentage of bonds outstanding to GDP of 13.6%.  \nB.  Banking Institutions in Indonesia \n \n2.  Bank Indonesia announced plans in January 2005 to strengthen the banking sector by \nencouraging consolidation and improving prudential banking and supervision. Bank Indonesia \nhopes to encourage small banks with less than Rp100 billion in capital to either raise more \ncapital or merge with healthier \"anchor banks\" before the end of 2010. It also announced the \ncriteria for anchor banks in July 2005. Bank Indonesia plans to improve operations of its credit \nbureau  to centralize  data  on  borrowers.  Another  important  banking  sector  reform  was  the \ndecision to eliminate the blanket guarantee on bank third-party liabilities. \n \n3.   Loan quality and risk management in the banking industry. Since the nonperforming \nloans (NPL) ratio of banks peaked at 48% in 1998, the asset quality of commercial banks in \nIndonesia has recovered. The NPL ratio of commercial banks fell to 4.07% in 2007 and 3.8% by \nthe end of 2008, and was 4.2% as of April 2009\u2014an improvement over 2005, but still higher \nthan in Malaysia (2.2%). Stronger corporate balance sheets, including less reliance on external \nfinancing, have also reduced risks. The average capital adequacy ratio in Q1 2009 is about \n17.82% is well above the prescribed prudential norm of 12%, and higher than the average in \nMalaysia (12.10%) and Thailand (14.16%).  \n \n  Table A2.1: Health of the Indonesian Banking Sector (%) \nItem  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  Q1 2009 \nNPL  7.2  48.6  32.9  18.8  12.1  7.4  6.8  6.2  7.6  7.0  4.07  3.8  4.2 \nRate of  1.4  (18.8)  (6.1)  1.6  1.5  2.0  2.63  3.46  2.55  2.64  2.78  2.33  2.76 \nreturn on \nassets \nCapital  9.1  (15.7)  (8.1)  2.1  18.9  22.4  19.4  19.4  19.3  21.2  19.3  16.7  18.0 \nadequacy \nratio \nNPL = nonperforming loan.  \nSource: Bank Indonesia; CEIC Data Company.  \n ", "  Appendix 2       41\nC.  Nonbank Financial Sector \n \n4.  Underdeveloped. The nonbank financial sector accounts for about one-fifth of total \nfinancial assets. The sector includes securities brokers and dealers, derivative market, mutual \nfunds (also known as investment companies), insurance companies, pension funds, pawnshops, \nrural institutions, and venture capital companies. In line with Indonesia\u2019s long-term development \nagenda and development priorities, the Government considers development of the nonbank \nfinancial sector urgent and imperative. Indonesian institutional investors are small and have not \nbeen a source of long-term capital. Pension funds and insurance companies invest a significant \nportion of their resources in short-term bank deposits.  \n \n5.  Shallow equities market. The market capitalization of Asian equities has tripled since \n1997. Capitalization as a percentage of GDP in Southeast Asian economies such as Hong Kong, \nChina; Malaysia; and Singapore compares favorably with that of Germany, the United Kingdom, \nand the United States. Indonesia\u2019s equities market remains one of the smallest in Asia and the \nPacific. The number of listed companies increased from 336 in 2005 to 401 as of July 2009 with \ntotal market capitalization of Rp1,719 trillion. \n \n6.  Small  bond  market.  Compared  to  other  economies  in  Asia,  the  bond  market  in \nIndonesia is still small. The bond market dropped to 13.6% of GDP in 2008 from 22.2% in 2007.  \n \n7.  Government  bond  market.  At  12.3%  of  GDP,  the  government  bond  market  in \nIndonesia is among the smallest in Asia. Only Hong Kong, China at 9.1% of GDP is smaller, but \nit has a sizeable corporate bond market at 30.4% of GDP. Although the capital market remains \nsmall  and  illiquid,  Indonesia  has  been  issuing  significant  volumes  of  government  bonds. \nLiquidity in the domestic market began to ease in January 2009.  \n \nTable A2.2: Size and Composition of Local Currency Bond Market \nAmount (billion)  Growth Rate (%) \nItem  Sep 2008  Oct 2008  Nov 2008  Dec 2008  Sep 2008  Oct  Nov  Dec 2008 \n2008  2008 \n  IDR  $  IDR  $  IDR  $  IDR  $  y-o-y  q-o-q  m-o-m  m-o-m    y-o-y   q-o-q     m-o-m \nTotal  736,560  77  752,939  69  775,667  65      (9.7)  (3.9)  22  3.0       \nGovernment  658,669  69  679,274  63  702,232  58      (10.3)  (3.7)  3.1  3.4       \nCentral  541,700  56  541,700  50  534,455  44  525,695  46  15.7  4.4  0.0  (1.3)  11.0  (3.0)  (1.6) \nGovernment \nbonds \nCentral bank  116,969  12  137,574  13  167,777  14             (56.1)  (29.2)  17.6  22.0       \nbonds \nCorporate  77,890  8  73,665  7  73,435  6  73,010  6  (9.7)  (5.6)  (5.4)  (0.3)  (7.7)  (7.7)  (0.6) \n( ) = negative, IDR =  \nSources: Bank Indonesia, Indonesia Stock Exchange, and Bloomberg LP/ \nhttp://asianbondsonline.adb.org/indonesia/writeup/writeup_2008_q1_id.pdf. \n \n8.  Credit default swap. In line with global conditions, credit defaults swaps have spiked, \nas indicated in Table A2.3.

Corporate  bond  market.  The  corporate  bond  market  was  only  1.3%  of  GDP  in  2008, \ncompared with the government bond market at about 12.3% of GDP. The size of the market has \nshrunk from 2.0% in 2007. This percentage is low compared to many of Indonesia's neighboring \ncountries\u2014Republic of Korea (47.0%); Malaysia (34.6%); Hong Kong, China (30.4%); Singapore \n(29.0%); Thailand (10.4%); and the Philippines (3.3%). However, the potential for the development of \ncorporate bond market in Indonesia is vast given the significant number of infrastructure development \nprojects in the pipeline. However, this will require a more comprehensive policy and serious efforts on \nthe part of Government and private sector. Greater transparency is expected in the future with the \nestablishment of the Bond Pricing Agency, but much more needs to be done. This also relates to the \nlow level of market capitalization of listed companies on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and \nsmall number of listed companies.  \n \nTable A2. 4: Local Currency Corporate Bond Market (% of GDP) \n \nEconomy  2007  2008  Country  2007  2008 \nPeople's Republic  4.4  6.1  Philippines 2.6  3.3 \nof China  \nHong Kong, China  38.8  30.4  Singapore 31.7  29.0 \nIndia  3.6  4.5  Thailand 11.0  10.4 \nIndonesia  2.1  1.4  Viet Nam 0.5  0.6 \nMalaysia  35.8  34.6  Emerging East Asia  13.6  12.5 \nTotal corporate \nRepublic of Korea       54.9  47.0  Japan 16.8  19.8 \nNote: 2008 GDP from the Economic Outlook Database, October 2008, IMF.

A similar trend in the erosion of value was observed for \ncollective investment schemes, where total net asset value fell from Rp92.19 trillion in 2007 to \nRp74.06 trillion in 2008, However, this decline did not affect the growth of units, which increased \nby 13.8% to 61.51 billion units in 2008. A total of 602 funds were offered in 2008, compared to \n473 at the end of 2007.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 2       43\n11.  Sharia-based capital market products. Islamic finance in Indonesia is newer than \nconventional finance, but has grown rapidly. Bank of Indonesia has developed a blueprint for \nsharia  banking  based  on  Islamic  principles.  Sharia-based  capital  market  products  were \nintroduced in Indonesia by a sharia investment fund in mid-1997. The Government is working on \na  comprehensive  framework  on  Islamic  finance  covering  legal,  rules,  accounting,  and  tax \nstructure to support its growth. Parliament approved a law on sovereign sharia securities on 7 \nMay 2008; it forms a legal basis for the Government to issue and utilize sovereign sharia \nsecurities to mobilize funds and finance national development. The law covers sovereign sharia \nsecurities in domestic and foreign currencies. In addition, Bapepam-LK issued its Rules on the \nIssuance of Shariah Securities and Criteria and Issuance of Shariah Securities List (Revised) in \nJune 2009.  Market participants have adopted 70% of the guidelines on the presentation of \nfinancial statements for selected instruments; full adoption is expected by 2012.  Bapepam-LK \nhas been involved in discussions with the Indonesian Accounting Association to formulate \naccounting standards for the issuance of sharia securities. In regard to the development of \nIslamic insurance, takaful, the Ministry of Finance will be submitting a bill to Parliament to \nstrengthen the legal basis for takaful operations.  \n \n12.  To address the tax disincentives for sharia-based products, Parliament approved the \nnew Income Tax Law (36/2008; article 31d), which allows the Government to regulate sharia-\nbased instruments. Another government regulation (25/2009) approved in March 2009 provides \nfor similar tax treatment as applied to conventional bonds to eliminate any disparity. In July 2008, \nParliament approved the issuance of government sukuk worth $2 billion. With credit markets \ntight, the Republic of Indonesia sold $650 million 5-year global sukuk, closing on 16 April 2009. \nMany see this development as a strong indication of the administration\u2019s increased attention to \ndeveloping sharia finance. It was the first dollar-denominated Islamic bond in the world in 2009 \nand is expected to spark demand for more.  \n \n13.  Newly introduced financial products and services. These include (i) exchange traded \nfunds, (ii) asset-backed securities (although no company has issued such securities since the \nregulations were introduced), (iii) single-stock futures, and (iv) stock lending and borrowing. A \nPresidential decree on secondary mortgage financing was issued in February 2005 establishing \nthe  Secondary  Mortgage  Corporation  (PT  Sarana  Multigriya  Finansial).  Its  function  is  to \npurchase  qualified  mortgages  from  financial  institutions  and  issue  bonds  backed  by  these \nassets. The target market for these mortgage-backed securities will be long-term investors, \nsuch  as  insurance  companies  and  pension  funds.  During  the  Secondary  Mortgage \nCorporation's first 3 years of operations, it is expected to lend to financial institutions, which will \nonlend for qualifying mortgages, to build up the critical mass of primary mortgage receivables. \nThe loans will help build qualified mortgage portfolios for purchase by Secondary Mortgage, as \nwell as a track record in the lower- and middle-income echelons of society. \n \nD.  Market Infrastructure \n \n14.  Indonesia  Stock  Exchange.  Based  in  Jakarta,  IDX  was  previously  known  as  the \nJakarta  Stock  Exchange  (JSX)  before  its  name  was  changed  in  2007  after  merging  with \nSurabaya Stock Exchange (SSX). The merger included in the Capital Market Master Plan \n(2005-2009) and the 2006 Financial Sector Policy Package has been completed and IDX has \nstarted operations. However, Indonesia still maintains two systems for clearing, settlement, and \ndeposits: the Indonesian Central Securities Depository (KSEI) and the Indonesian Clearing and \nGuarantee Corporation (KPEI). IDX, KSEI, and KPEI are self-regulating organizations with the \nauthority to set rules and oversee the activities of brokers, dealers, and custodian banks dealing \nin securities and bond trading. Indonesia has 158 securities brokerages end 2008. Established \n ", " 4 4           Appendix 2 \nin 1994, Pefindo is Indonesia\u2019s largest rating agency. It is an affiliate of Standard and Poor\u2019s and \nhas adapted its rating methodology. The only other rating agency is PT Fitch Rating Indonesia, \nincorporated in 2006. It focuses on asset-backed securities, including plans for securitized \nmortgages, which have not developed yet in Indonesia as the first securitized mortgage was \nonly issued in 2009. Development of the financial sector and the capital market in particular is \nhampered by an inability to obtain and/or enforce timely commercial judgments. Other agencies \nhave provided support to the judiciary to enhance its capacity, but more assistance is required. \n \n15.  High trading cost. Table A2.5 provides total trading cost, which includes commissions \nand fees charged for trading in 13 countries, including Indonesia. Overall, the average total \ntrading cost fell from 46.80 basis points in 2005 to 39.83 basis in 2008 with most jurisdictions \nshowing declines. Based on total trading cost of 72.00 basis points in 2005 and 52.98 basis \npoints in 2008, Indonesia is the least cost-effective market after the Philippines. Most countries \nin this region had cost-efficient trading in 2008\u2014Malaysia (41.10 basis points); Thailand (42.73); \nSingapore (35.50); and Hong Kong, China (41.42). \n \nTable A2.5: Trading Costs \n \nTotal Trading \n  Costa  Commission and Fees  Market Impactb \nEconomy  2005  2008  2005  2008  2005  2008 \nPhilippines  99.00  80.47  75.00  69.33  24.00  11.14 \nIndonesia  72.00  52.98  56.00  42.61  16.00  10.37 \nThailand  66.00  42.73  43.00  30.11  23.00  12.62 \nMalaysia  60.00  41.11  39.00  30.32  21.00  10.79 \nSingapore  40.00  35.5  28.00  24.21  12.00  11.29 \nRepublic of Korea  58.00  50.3  42.00  39.38  16.00  10.92 \nTaipei,China  54.00  49.42  38.00  39.00  16.00  10.42 \nHong Kong, China  41.00  41.42  32.00  28.83  9.00  12.59 \nJapan  20.00  21.5  14.00  15.92  6.00  5.58 \nUK  29.00  47.45  16.00  40.24  13.00  7.21 \nNASDAQ  30.00  17.51  17.00  12.07  14.00  5.44 \nNYSE  17.51  13.89  15.00  9.77  8.00  4.12 \nGermany  22.00  23.56  18.00  16.11  5.00  7.45 \nNASDAQ = National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation; NYSE = New York Stock \nExchange; UK = United Kingdom \na  Total fees charged for trade execution, clearing, and settlement. \nb  Market Impact: Adverse price movement as a result of the trade\u2014defined as the gap between executed     \n     price and last bid/offer. \nSource: Elkins McSherry Survey. \n \n16.  Small insurance sector. The insurance industry is still small in terms of the ratio of \npremiums to GDP, although it grew from 1.57% in 2006 to 1.88% in 2007. The gross premiums \ncollected by the insurance industry in 2007 reached Rp74.51 trillion, 42% higher than the \nRp52.42  trillion  collected  in  2006.  Since  2003,  the  annual  growth  of  gross  premiums  has \naveraged about 20%. Insurance companies invest about 25% of their assets in short-term \ndeposits. Based on an unaudited insurance report, the assets of the 142 insurance companies \ntotaled Rp201.99 trillion, or 4.1% of GDP, as of December 2008.  \n \n17.  Unlike in banking, large-scale corporate failures have not been seen among insurers, \nmainly because regulations required insurers to hold a high proportion of their funds in bank \n ", "  Appendix 2       45\ndeposits. Indonesia has 51 life insurance companies, 97 general insurance companies, and 4 \nreinsurance  companies.  The  industry  is  heavily  concentrated,  with  the  top  five  general \ninsurance companies accounting for 51% of general insurance assets and the top five life \ninsurance  companies  accounting  for  55%  of  life  insurance  assets.  The  licenses  of  eight \ncompanies\u2014five life insurance and three general insurance\u2014were withdrawn in 2006. The \nGovernment still needs to address the remaining one state life and two insolvent general \ninsurance companies. The market is open to new entrants, and some of the major multinational \nfirms are represented in both sectors. A draft insurance law (including provisions on takaful) is \nexpected to be submitted to Parliament for approval by the end of 2009. \n \n18.  In terms of insurance penetration, based on premiums in percentage of GDP in 2007, \nIndonesia ranked 60 in the world, far below the Republic of Korea (5); Hong Kong, China (6); \nSingapore (18); Malaysia (32); and Thailand (41). \n \nTable A2.6: Insurance Penetration: Premiums in % of GDP in 2007 \n \n          \nWorld \nEnomomy  Total Business  Life  Non-life Business \nRanking \nBusiness \n5  Republic of Korea  11.8  8.2  3.6 \n6  Hong Kong, China  11.8  10.6  1.2 \n10  Japan  9.6  7.5  2.1 \n18  Singapore  7.6  6.2  1.5 \n32  Malaysia  4.6  3.1  1.5 \n41  Thailand  3.4  1.8  1.5 \n48  People's Republic  China  2.9  1.8  1.1 \n69  Indonesia  1.6  1.1  0.5 \n73  Philippines  1.5  0.9  0.5 \n74  Viet Nam  1.5  0.8  0.7 \n         Source: Swiss Re Economic Research & Consulting. \n \n19.  Small pension sector. In Indonesia, the pension sector is small, accounting for less \nthan 4.7% of GDP in assets, compared with Thailand (8.4%), Malaysia (57%), and Australia \n(75%). Indonesia had 288 private pension funds with net assets of Rp69.17 trillion as of June \n2008, covering privately managed employer pension funds and financial institution pension \nfunds.  Only  12%  of  the  workforce  is  covered  by  the  public  pension  and  old-age  savings \nprograms, provided by PT Jamsostek for private sector workers, by PT Taspen for civil servants, \nand by PT Asabri for the military. Less than 2% of the workforce is covered by voluntary private \npensions.  The  Private  Pensions  Law  (11/1992)  will  be  reviewed  and  amendments  will  be \nsubmitted together with the amendments proposed to the Capital Market Law and the Insurance \nLaw. The main impediments are (i) private pensions have to compete with other financial \nproducts, such as mutual funds and insurance, which are more flexible (allowing for early \nwithdrawals) and have better tax benefits; (ii) private pension savings have to be converted into \nannuities at unattractive rates at retirement age; and (iii) although taxation of private pensions is \ntheoretically an exempt-exempt-taxable regime, in practice this is not the case.  \n   \n20.  Bapepam-LK oversees the voluntary pension schemes. Overall, the pension sector is \ncharacterized by low coverage and limited capitalization. About half of the assets are in public \nprograms, and half in private programs. To enhance the performance of the pension fund \nindustry, the Ministerial Decree on Pension (Decree 199/PMK-010) was issued in December \n2008 to allow for investment in a wider range of domestic instruments. There is no unified \nprogram providing pensions for Indonesians, although several schemes promising lump sum \nbenefits or pensions for various segments of workers exist. Civil servants receive lump sum \n ", " 4 6           Appendix 2 \nbenefits and monthly pensions after retirement. The same benefits are also granted to members \nof the armed forces. A provident fund is established for private workers providing lump sum \nbenefits upon reaching the age of 55. Monthly pensions are still luxury for most private workers \nas only few employers adopt and implement pension programs voluntarily. No formal program \nhas ever been established for informal workers to make income available in old age. However, \nsince the enactment of the Pension Funds Law (No. 11/ 1992), the private pension sector has \ngrown steadily. Total assets of all private pension funds (employer pension funds and financial \ninstitution pension funds) at the end of 2007 were Rp90 trillion. More than 4,400 employers and \nabout 2.5 million active participants and beneficiaries participate in various pension programs. \n \nE.  Impressive Improvement in Indonesia's Competitiveness1 \n \n21.  The institutional reforms pursued by Indonesia in recent years have begun to bear fruit. \nThe IMD Competitive Center\u2014a leading world think tank and educational institution based in \nLausanne, Switzerland\u2014reported a major improvement in Indonesia's global competitiveness. \nIndonesia moving up from 51st to 42nd among the 57 major nations surveyed worldwide. These \nresults are published in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2009. Indonesia now stands \nin the same group as other emerging markets such as Brazil and ahead of the Philippines, \nMexico, South Africa and the Russia Federation. Despite this, Indonesia\u2019s competitiveness \nremains below that of India, Thailand, the People's Republic of China, and Malaysia.  \n22.  In ranking these nations, the IMD applied 329 criteria. Two-thirds of the criteria are \nobjective indicators in the form of statistics and other quantitative data, while the remainder are \nperception indicators obtained through interviews. The rankings for 2009 are based on results \nand data from 2008. For Indonesia, the improvement in 2009 was achieved through significant \ngains in economic performance, which climbed from 52nd place in 2009 to 41st in 2009, \nfollowed by government efficiency (up from number 38 in 2008 to 31 in 2009) and business \nefficiency (from 44 to 38).  Indonesia still needs to improve infrastructure, an area in which its \nranking slipped from 51st in 2008 to 53rd in 2009. The IMD also performed stress testing to \nassess country resilience to economic crisis.  The stress test results show that Indonesia ranks \n33rd in resilience to the global crisis. Of the four factors assessed in the stress test, Indonesia\u2019s \nresilience for the government factor rank best at 26th.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nBefore the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia had been successful in reducing poverty, with rates in terms of the \npopulation living below $1 per day dropping from more than 50% in 1970 to 16% in 1996. However, at the peak \nof the crisis in 1998, the poverty incidence reached 24%. Although it has been steadily falling since then, poverty \nremains persistent in Indonesia. Recent surveys suggest that about half of the population still lives below the $2 \nper day poverty line. Continued economic growth has lifted living standards; however, the benefits of economic \ngrowth are not equally distributed among the population. Rural poverty is significantly higher that urban poverty, \nwith about 60% of the country\u2019s poor living in rural areas. Causes of both urban and rural poverty include \nabsence of economic opportunities, lack of access to key social services, and poor infrastructure. \n \nThe medium-term national development plan, 2004\u20132009a provides a clear set of targets that the Government \nwants to achieve by the end of the period. Among them are sustained growth of more than 6%, job creation to \nabsorb 1.5 million new entrants into the labor market annually, achievement of Millennium Development Goal \ntargets, and a reduction in the stock of debt to 31.8% of gross domestic product. The medium-term development \nplan sets out a good policy framework for the reforms and investments needed for each sector. Some adjustment \nin growth rates for 2009 and 2010 is now acknowledged because of the impact of the global crisis. After growing \nmore than 6% in 2007 and 2008, the economic growth is expected to slow to 3.5% in 2009, before recovering to \nabout 5% in 2010. Policies envisaged under the Government\u2019s medium-term macroeconomic framework aimed \nto help mitigate economic vulnerabilities, improve the business climate, and encourage investment. Therefore, \nthe Government is placing a high priority on continuing reforms in investment procedures and regulations, \ncustoms  and  trade  facilitation,  and  labor  regulation,  as  well  as  dedicated  actions  aimed  at  improving \ninfrastructure and strengthening the financial sector to support a sound investment climate. To support faster \neconomic growth and poverty reduction, the Program supports the Government\u2019s development agenda to \nestablish Indonesia's capital market as a resilient and competitive market that supports higher growth for the \nnational economy. The Program will provide a policy framework that encourages financial innovation in terms of \nnew instruments and tenors, and new kinds of intermediation. \n \nThe Program supports the achievement of the medium-term reform agenda's economic growth and poverty \nreduction targets. It is also included in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s overall strategy, which sees capital market \nand financial sector reforms as a key area of engagement to address poverty and regional disparities, and to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals for development. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                         Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nAbout half of Indonesia's 235 million people are considered poor and survive on less than $2 a day; about 18% \nlive on $1 or less. In addition, a significant portion of Indonesia's population has an income that is just above the \npoverty line. A large proportion of vulnerable people are at risk of falling into poverty because of accelerating \ninflation caused by increases in food and oil prices, and the impacts of natural disasters. Poverty-related \nchallenges in Indonesia are not only the large number of poor but also the striking disparities between regions, \nprovinces, districts, and cities. Poverty is expected to increase in 2009 because of the global financial crisis. In \nresponse, the Government aims to increase development and social spending in 2009. The additional funding is \nneeded to mitigate the substantial negative effects on Indonesia's economy, and especially on the poor, of the \n ", "  Appendix  6   69    \ndeep  and  possibly  protracted  economic  recessions  in  Indonesia's  major  trading  partners.  Based  on  the \nexperience gained from the Asian crisis 1997\u20131998, the Government placed the task of reassuring financial \nmarkets at the top of its crisis response agenda. Aware of how important it is for the overall economic prospects \nof Indonesia during the crisis to maintain financial market confidence, the Government undertook several policy \nactions to soften the impact of the crisis on the vulnerable population.  \n \n2. Design Features. The Government's medium-term reform agenda includes financial sector development with \ncapital market development as one of the core elements. Over the longer term, these reforms will increase \nIndonesia's reliance on domestic financial markets for meeting its investment needs. The impact of the Program \nwill be greater financial sector diversification and resilience. The Program is embedded in the Government's \nmedium-term reform agenda. The outcome of the Program is sufficient capital market growth to enable more \ndiversification of markets combined with stronger regulatory and supervisory capacity to ensure resilience of the \nfinancial sector as well as the economy. The Program is expected to lead to an increase in the nonbank financial \nsector\u2019s  share  of  total  financial  assets.  The  Program  supports  the  Government\u2019s  development  agenda  to \nestablish the Indonesian capital market as a resilient and competitive market that supports faster growth for the \nnational economy. \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nDespite recent signs of progress, Indonesia lags its more prosperous neighbors in producing higher value-added \nnonagricultural jobs. Job growth has failed to match population growth since the Asian crisis, and job creation in \nthe formal sector has been especially sluggish. Though the open unemployment rate has fallen since its peak of \n11.2% in 2005 to 9.1% in 2007, unemployment remains high, especially among youth. Of greatest concern is \nthat, as of 2008, more than 40% of Indonesia\u2019s labor force still derived its livelihood from low-productivity \nactivities in agriculture and related areas, while only 30% of Indonesia\u2019s growing labor force appears to have \nmade the transition to what are considered high value-added activities. The country\u2019s authorities understand that \nthe central challenges Indonesia faces in realizing its development agenda are all, in one form or another, \ninstitutional. Development and sustainability of the financial sector through market-based reforms remain high on \nIndonesia's reform agenda. \n \nCapital market development contributes to poverty reduction in Indonesia. Against this backdrop, the Program \nwill  help  Indonesia  adopt  measures  that  would  lead  to  broader  access  to  financial  services  and  a  more \ncompetitive and diversified financial sector that reduces systemic vulnerability and meets the immediate funding \nneeds of the economy. It will lead to enhanced market-based financial intermediation, more efficiency and \noutreach of financial services and products, and stronger key institutions and human resources for the financial \nsector. Overall, the Program will lead to a more balanced and competitive financial structure, increase income \nand  employment-generation,  reduce  income  fluctuation  of  individuals  and  businesses,  and  contribute  to \nmacroeconomic stability and poverty reduction.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.          Findings of Social Analysis \nKey Issues. No direct issues. The budgetary support through the Program will help the Government stimulate \nlong-term economic growth and competitiveness. \n \nB.           Consultation and Participation  \nThe  Program  is  part  of  the  Government's  broad  reform  agenda  and  is  anchored  in  the  Government's \ncomprehensive financial sector reform and policy measures. It was designed through a participatory process \ninvolving major government and nongovernment stakeholders at the national level, and development partners. \nParticipation took place through regular consultations. During its implementation, broad stakeholder participation \nhas been maintained. The Government is strongly committed to developing the capital markets through the \nCapital Market Master Plan (CMMP) and the Financial Sector Policy Package (FSPP). The initiatives represent a \ncombination of economic, business, legal, and regulatory factors designed to enhance the role of the Indonesian \ncapital market as an engine of economic growth. The Program supports qualitative changes to processes to \nensure effective implementation. It focuses on outcomes and allows for greater flexibility in actions necessary to \nachieve compliance. It is predicated on the need for a policy and institutional response to significant market \ndevelopments since the completion of the subprogram 1. This will help to create deeper and more liquid capital \nmarkets. At the same time, the Program will promote stronger intermediaries that are better able to mobilize and \n ", "70       Appendix 6 \n \n \nallocate  resources  and  risks.  Better  market  surveillance  and  investor  protection  will  promote  stability  and \nresilience,  and  are  essential  for  capital  market  development.  To  maintain  the  momentum  in  reforms,  the \nGovernment proposes to have in place the CMMP for 2010\u20132015 developed and implemented through ADB \ntechnical assistance. Together with broader economic reforms in Indonesia, the reform of capital markets will \ncontribute to productivity growth, employment generation, and financial sector stability \n2.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Capital Market Development Program Cluster (CMDPC) supports the Government\u2019s \nreform agenda for the financial sector. The policy measures include a set of reforms to promote \nthe diversification of financial channels by enhancing the growth and development of the capital \nmarkets. The CMDPC has two subprograms. ADB approved a single-tranche loan of $300 \nmillion under subprogram 1 (2006\u20132007) of the cluster in December 2007. Subprogram 2 \ncovers the period October 2007\u2013August 2009. This environmental assessment report examines \nthe environmental impacts of the policy component of the subprogram 2. \n \nB.  Description of the Policy Interventions \n \n2.  The reform agenda is structured around the following policy outcomes, which form the \nbasis of the four components for the proposed CMDPC: (i) enhancing information disclosure \nand price discovery, (ii) promoting deeper and more liquid financial markets, (iii) improving \nmarket surveillance and investor protection, and (iv) strengthening governance and human \nresource capacity. \n \n3.  The CMDPC is embedded in the Government\u2019s medium-term reform agenda, and the \ntwo-tranche structure will provide the Government with the flexibility to adjust the Program and \nits speed of implementation according to country developments. \n \nTable A8: Environmental Assessment of the Policy Interventions \n \nPolicy Area  Economic and Social  Environmental  Mitigation \nOutcome  Impact  Measures \n1.
