In Asia and the Pacific, many of the region\u2019s poor live in developing member countries \n(DMCs) that are faced with particular development challenges related to weak institutional \ncapacity, poor governance, political instability, and, in some instances, conflict or post-conflict \nsituations. To operate more effectively in such challenging settings, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) has developed a specific strategic and operational approach.1 This approach \nacknowledges that modes of engagement should be tailored to the specific needs of countries \ndeemed  to  be  weakly  performing  according  to  ADB\u2019s  country  performance  assessments \n(CPAs)2 or that typically show signs of fragility. The approach provides a framework for planning \nand implementing interventions and proposes a menu of options allowing ADB to operate more \nflexibly. A steering committee was formed in October 2007 to guide the implementation of this \napproach.3 A focal point for fragile and conflict-affected situations, the secretary to the steering \ncommittee, was appointed in June 2008 to provide technical support for leading the approach. \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s engagement with weakly performing countries was a major theme of the ninth \nreplenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF). An operational approach is considered \ncritical for achieving significant progress within the ADB results framework. ADB\u2019s long-term \nstrategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)4 also gives special consideration to forms of \nassistance in fragile situations.5 Concept clearance for the proposed technical assistance (TA) \nwas obtained in November 2008 and the Fact-Finding Mission took place in January 2009.6 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  A Growing Priority of the Global Agenda on Aid Effectiveness. The question of aid \neffectiveness and modes of engagement in situations of fragility and conflict has received \ngrowing attention in international development debates over the past few years. The 2005 \nSenior  Level  Forum  on  Development  Effectiveness  in  Fragile  States7  was  an  important \nmilestone that helped shape consensus on how donors should engage with countries in fragile \nsituations.  From  extensive  research  and  case  studies,  the  Organisation  for  Economic \nCo-operation and Development\u2013Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) proposed \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Achieving Development Effectiveness in Weakly Performing Countries (The Asian Development \nBank\u2019s Approach to Engaging with Weakly Performing Countries). Manila. This document is referred to in the \npresent report as \u201cthe approach.\u201d  \n2  According to the methodology adopted in the approach, weak performers are DMCs that either (i) ranked in the \nfourth or fifth quintile in CPA exercises for 2 of the most recent 3 years, or (ii) are considered to be in conflict or \npost-conflict.  \n3  The steering committee, chaired by the director general of the Strategy and Policy Department, is composed of the \nheads  of  the five  regional  departments;  the  Office  of the  General  Counsel;  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department;  the  Budget,  Personnel,  and  Management  Systems  Department;  the  Office  of \nCofinancing Operations; and the Central Operations Services Office. \n4  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n5  The reference to \u201cfragile situations\u201d is now generally preferred to \u201cfragile states\u201d or \u201cweakly performing countries,\u201d \nas it focuses the engagement on operational risks in specific conditions\u2014for instance, in particular sectors or \ninstitutions, or at the subnational level\u2014rather than on a country in general.  \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 January 2009. \n7  The forum, convened by the OECD-DAC, the European Commission, the United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP), and the World Bank, was hosted by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom \nin London on 13\u201314 January 2005. \n ", "2   \nthe  Principles  for  Good  International  Engagement  in  Fragile  States  and  Situations.  The \nprinciples  complement  the  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness  (March  2005)  and  are \ncommonly used to guide joint donor assistance in post-conflict settings. As part of the effort to \nharmonize aid practices, a working group of multilateral development banks (MDBs) was formed \nin March 2007. The heads of the MDBs8 issued a joint statement on 20 October 2007 with \nagreed goals, principles, and operational approaches for engaging in fragile situations.  \n \n4.  The Accra Agenda for Action (September 2008) reaffirms the commitment of donors and \npartner countries to adapt policies for countries in fragile situations. Five specific actions to this \nend are identified: (i) joint assessments of governance and capacity and examination of the \ncauses  of  conflict,  fragility,  and  insecurity;  (ii)  agreement  on  a  set  of  realistic  peace  and \nstate-building objectives that address the root causes of conflict and fragility; (iii) provision of \ndemand-driven, tailored, and coordinated capacity development support for core state functions \nand for early and sustained recovery; (iv) work on flexible, rapid, and long-term modes of \nfunding to support stabilization, inclusive peace building, and the development of capable, \naccountable, and responsive states; and (v) monitoring of the implementation of the Principles \nfor Good International Engagement in Fragile States and Situations in selected countries. \n \n5.  Challenging Environments for Poverty Reduction. Development agencies working in \nfragile situations are faced with particular challenges and higher risks. Such situations typically \ncall  for  the  use  of  a  range  of  instruments  including  development  aid,  diplomacy,  security, \nhumanitarian  assistance,  and  financial  measures  such  as  debt  relief.  A  coherent \n\u201cwhole-of-government\u201d approach is necessary, often requiring MDBs to be involved in areas of \nwork beyond the mainstream of their operations (e.g., justice, human rights, humanitarian and \nemergency relief, reintegration of ex-combatants) and to engage in dialogue with a variety of \nactors in the donor, diplomatic, defense, and humanitarian communities.9 Such engagement in \npost-conflict settings reflects the overriding priority of aid toward preventing the country from \nreverting to conflict while creating the conditions for the people to benefit from the dividends of \npeace. Aid also tends to be less efficient and effective in reaching the poor in countries in a \nconflict setting, or with high corruption, poor governance, and weak country systems. Research \nlargely confirms that good performers best translate aid into development results and poverty \nreduction.10 Moreover, ownership and alignment of assistance in fragile situations are often \nproblematic\u2014institutional  capacity  is  weaker,  strategic  and  policy  frameworks  for  national \ndevelopment and poverty reduction are lacking, and countries rely more heavily on external \naid\u2014and yet are necessary for more effective poverty reduction. Development partners have \ntherefore  sought  to  align  and  harmonize  aid  through  transitional  results  frameworks,  post-\nconflict needs assessments, or sector-level frameworks.11\n \n6.  The Need for Longer-Term Engagement and More Predictable Aid Flows. As a \nresult of these challenges and risks, aid tends to be more volatile in fragile situations and donors \nare generally under-engaged in weakly performing countries (except in countries emerging from \n                                                 \n8  The African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the International Monetary \nFund, and the World Bank. \n9  See, for instance, OECD. 2006. Whole of Government Approaches to Fragile States. Paris.  \n10 See, for instance, Dollar, David, and Paul Collier. 1999. Aid Allocation and Poverty Reduction. World Bank Policy \nResearch Working Paper No. 2041. Washington, DC. \n11 The World Bank and the United Nations Development Group prepared in 2007 the Joint Guidance Note on \nPost Conflict Needs Assessments and Transitional Results Frameworks.  ", "  3\nrecent conflict).12 Aid to these countries is typically less\u2014even taking into account the impact of \nthe performance-based allocation systems adopted by MDBs\u2014although increased and more \nstable  engagement  is  needed  to  reduce  income  and  non-income  poverty.  The  risk  of \ncross-border spillover is another concern and a key motivation for more effective engagement in \nfragile situations.13 Thus, both progress toward the Millennium Development Goals and the \npotential impact of fragile situations on global economic performance and security demand that \ndevelopment  agencies  seek  ways  to  engage  durably  in  situations  where  partnerships  for \npoverty reduction are more difficult to sustain. To achieve development results, donors should \nbe willing to remain engaged for the long term and accept the likelihood of setbacks.  \n \n7.  Emerging Good Practice. Field experience in development in fragile situations and \ncommissioned research point to a number of good practices. Before engagement, the political \neconomy and the root causes of the fragility or conflict must be analyzed well. The findings will \ndetermine  the  feasibility  of  the  interventions  and  inform  the  design  and  implementation  of \noperations.  Various  aid  instruments  should  be  used;  their  selection  can  be  based  on  an \nassessment  of  state  capacity,  on  the  one  hand,  and  government  commitment  to  poverty \nreduction,  on  the  other.  The  sequencing  of  instruments  and  their  relationship  to  political \nprocesses also deserves particular attention.14 In designing their operations, donors should not \nattempt to bypass weak government capacity and systems. Rather, their overriding focus should \nbe on supporting the authorities in assuming core functions of the state, including security and \nthe provision of basic needs. Delivery of basic services is thus a good entry point for donors, \nboth for its own sake and for the sake of gaining public support for the reform and reconstruction \nefforts of the government.15  \n \n8.  The Need to Differentiate and Customize Operational Approaches. ADB DMCs can \nbenefit from adopting elements of the approach in many different ways, and no single or \nstandardized  engagement  model  can  apply  uniformly  across  countries.  While  country \ntypologies16 have been useful in drawing up general models of engagement, aid effectiveness \nrequires differentiation based on risks and causes of fragility specific to each country. ADB\u2019s \napproach  therefore  promotes  the  adoption  in  its  country  partnership  strategies  (CPSs)  of \ndifferent models of engagement. Elements of such models can influence, among others, (i) the \nselection of aid instruments; (ii) the focus and strategic directions of interventions; (iii) the \napplication of business processes; (iv) responses to the challenges of ownership, alignment, \nand harmonization; and (v) field presence and capacity to supervise operations. \n                                                 \n12 See, for instance, Dollar, David, and Victoria Levin. 2005.

The African Development Bank has adopted a \ncontinuum approach that distinguishes between countries characterized by (i) marked deterioration, (ii) active \nconflict or prolonged crisis, (iii) post-crisis and transition, and (iv) gradual improvement.  \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will help bring into the ADB mainstream different operational approaches to \nsituations of fragility or post-conflict. Pilot country initiatives that localize particular elements of \nADB\u2019s approach in country settings will be implemented. In parallel, the TA will develop and \ndisseminate tools and knowledge to facilitate ADB\u2019s engagement in fragile situations. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The resident missions and regional departments concerned, in consultation with relevant \nagencies of the participating countries and with the assistance of the ADB fragile situations \nsupport team (FSST)17 at ADB headquarters, will prepare requests for TA support\u2014called \ninitiatives\u2014that  address  specific  challenges  that  face  ADB  in  fragile  environments.  These \ninitiatives will augment the capacity of ADB and government counterparts to formulate and \nimplement different strategic and operational approaches. This methodology was tested during \nthe Fact-Finding Mission in a sample of countries. \n \n11.  A two-pronged approach to operations support, which takes into account both the DMCs\u2019 \nabsorptive capacity and ADB\u2019s field presence and skills mix, is proposed. In DMCs considered \nto be weakly performing or faced with post-conflict challenges, where ADB already has a field \npresence and substantial programs in place, initiatives will support the adoption of elements of \nADB\u2019s approach that can improve program delivery and quality. The following areas would \ntypically be covered: (i) supplementary resources to strengthen project supervision and risk \nmonitoring in challenging institutional environments, geographic areas, or sectors; (ii) support \nfor capacity development, including the upgrading of country systems as provided in the Paris \nDeclaration; (iii) analytic work on issues of fragility, vulnerability, or conflict, including political \neconomy  analysis,  conflict  analysis,  or  a  study  on  ways  of  incorporating  peace-building \nprocesses  into  operations;  and  (iv)  facilitation  of  dialogue  with  government  and  other \ndevelopment partners for coordinated adoption of best practices and best methods.  \n \n12.  In small or new DMCs where ADB has no field presence or limited programs, initiatives \nwill primarily help establish or supplement the field presence and capacity to draw up different \nstrategic and operational approaches to address the root causes of fragility. The assistance \nwould cover (i) analytic work to support the preparation of the first CPS or other programmatic \ndocuments, including joint assessments of damage and needs; (ii) expertise and supplementary \nresources to facilitate dialogue and coordination with the government or transitional authority, \nwhere  relevant;  (iii)  expertise  and  supplementary  resources  to  establish  coordination \nmechanisms and develop joint work with other development partners; and (iv) pilot-testing of \ncapacity development models geared to the specific needs of small countries.  \n \n13.  To disseminate knowledge and provide technical support to operations staff, the TA will \ncontribute to the establishment of a resource center to be managed by the FSST and an in-\nhouse  network  of  operations  in  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situations.  Country  initiatives \nsupported by the TA will be disseminated through the network, which will also be the primary \n                                                 \n17 The FSST, hosted by ADB Pacific Department (PARD), will consist of the ADB focal point for fragile and conflict-\naffected situations, a national officer, and an administrative assistant assigned by PARD to provide the focal point \nmechanism with part-time support. Two TA-funded consultants will be integrated into the FSST to work on the \ndevelopment of country initiatives (see para. 15 below). ", "  5\nmeans of sharing experiences and reporting progress in implementing the approach throughout \nADB.  A  C-Cube  platform  will  be  developed  to  facilitate  communication  between  network \nparticipants and access to information and resources from ADB and its institutional partners. A \nfinal publication on country initiatives and the TA findings will be produced.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  (Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund\u2013IV).  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented from July 2009 to December 2011, and will be executed and \nimplemented by ADB. The focal point for fragile and conflict-affected situations, assisted by the \nFSST  and  working  under  the  guidance  of  the  steering  committee,  will  exercise  overall \ncoordination and supervision. While all DMCs may participate in the TA, priority will be given to \npost-conflict or weakly performing countries identified in past assessments. TA activities will \nbegin in a particular country after ADB receives the no-objection statement from the government \nconcerned regarding the inclusion of the DMC.  \n \n16.   A  TA  coordinator  and  expert  on  fragile  and  post-conflict  situations  (international \nconsultant, 12 person-months), based at ADB headquarters, will assist the regional departments \nand regional missions in identifying the need for services and developing initiatives, and, where \nfeasible, in directly supporting implementation. A specialist in knowledge management and \nnetworking  (national  consultant,  15  person-months)  will  help  prepare,  implement,  and \ndisseminate country initiatives through the resource center and the in-house network. Both \nconsultants, to be integrated into the FSST, will do intermittent work under the supervision of the \nfocal  point.  The  implementation  of  country  initiatives  will  require  the  hiring  of  national \nconsultants  (total  of  60  person-months)  and  short-term  inputs  from  international  experts \n(6 person-months). The scope of services will be determined for each case and detailed terms \nof reference will be prepared as part of the country initiatives. (Generic terms of reference, and \nsuggested outlines and criteria for reviewing country initiatives, are presented in Appendix 3.) \nThe consultants will be recruited by ADB according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The focal point will submit TA progress reports together \nwith other reports to the steering committee at its semiannual meetings.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n17.

Technical Support from ADB Headquarters \n1.  The consultants recruited under the technical assistance (TA) and operating out of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) headquarters will be integrated into the fragile situations support \nteam (FSST) hosted by ADB\u2019s Pacific Department with an ADB-wide mandate. The FSST will \nconsist  of  the  ADB  focal  point  for  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situations  (ADB  staff);  an \nadministrative staff and a national officer (ADB staff) from the Pacific Department, for part-time \nsupport for the focal point mechanism; a TA coordinator and expert in fragile and post-conflict \nsituations (international consultant, intermittent); and a TA knowledge management and networking \nspecialist (national consultant, intermittent). The terms of reference of the two experts to be hired \nunder the TA are outlined below. \n1.  Technical Assistance Coordinator and Expert in Fragile and Post-conflict \nSituations (international, 12 person-months) \n2.  This consultant, working under the supervision of the focal point and in close collaboration \nwith the FSST at ADB headquarters, will mainly provide technical support to resident missions and \nregional departments particularly in the development of full-fledged country initiatives that meet the \nestablished criteria and quality requirements. In coordination with the ADB offices concerned, he or \nshe  will  support  the  selection  of  other  consultants  for  the  initiatives.  Where  feasible  and \nappropriate, and as needed by the regional missions and regional departments, this consultant \nmay  directly  support  and  contribute  to  the  implementation  of  country  initiatives  in  his  or  her \ndomains of expertise. He or she will also review and exercise quality control of all outputs and \nknowledge products delivered by the TA, including materials posted on the Web and the intranet, \ncountry initiatives, and consultants\u2019 reports. \n3.  The TA coordinator and expert in fragile and post-conflict situations will (i) coordinate with \nthe regional departments and regional missions in identifying and developing country initiatives; \n(ii) review  and  finalize  country  initiatives  according  to  the  established  criteria  and  quality \nrequirements; (iii) assist in identifying and selecting experts for the proposed initiative; (iv) give \ntechnical advice to the regional departments and regional missions for the implementation of \ncountry initiatives; (v) where desirable, directly support the regional missions in implementing \nspecific country initiatives; (vi) guide and support the other consultants as necessary for the \nimplementation of initiatives; (vii) assist in preparing and disseminating knowledge products related \nto the country initiatives; (viii) review and exercise quality control of all materials and knowledge \nproducts posted on the Web and disseminated through the network; (ix) facilitate the eventual \ndiscussion  forum  on  the  network;  (x)  prepare  and  submit  regular  (quarterly)  TA  reports  and \ncontribute to ADB-wide progress reports on the fragile situations agenda; and (xi) contribute as \ncoeditor and author to the final TA publication. \n2.  Knowledge Management and Networking Specialist (national, 15 person-months) \n4.  This consultant, working under the supervision of the focal point and in close collaboration \nwith the FSST at ADB headquarters, will be mainly responsible for preparing and disseminating \nknowledge on country initiatives, by setting up and managing a resource center and an in-house \nnetwork  of  operations  in  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situations.  The  consultant  will  mainly \n(i) develop  and  update  information  databases;  (ii)  maintain  a  document  repository  system; \n(iii) manage and disseminate knowledge products and publications for the TA, including reports on \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n \ncountry  initiatives  and  the  final  publication;  and  (iv)  develop  Web  and  intranet  content.  For \ninformation  to  be  disseminated  outside  ADB,  the  consultant,  in  coordination  with  ADB\u2019s \nDepartment of External Relations, will draft and update Web pages on ADB\u2019s approach, to be \nposted on adb.org. For information to be disseminated within ADB, the consultant will establish and \nmaintain a C-Cube platform as document repository system and main tool for communication of the \nnetwork, in coordination with the Office of Information Technology. \n5.  The in-house network will provide a platform for disseminating knowledge on operations in \nfragile and conflict-affected situations (\u201cthe domain\u201d) within ADB. Through mutual learning and \nsharing, the network will help strengthen staff collaboration, networking, and competencies, for the \nbenefit of ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs). The functions envisaged for the network, \nto  be  developed  progressively  as  needed,  will  consist  of  (i)  facilitating  members\u2019  access  to \ninformation and resources on the domain, (ii) developing and providing access to a roster of \nexperts and practitioners, (iii) posting and reviewing country initiatives proposed as part of the TA, \n(iv) providing opportunities for further direct staff exchange, possibly through a chat-room facility, \nand (v) facilitating corporate reporting on the implementation of ADB\u2019s approach in general and the \nTA in particular. Membership in the network will be open to all ADB staff on request, but the \nmembers are expected to come mainly from country teams and regional mission staff working in \nDMCs where elements of ADB\u2019s approach are being implemented, including staff involved in the \nimplementation of the TA. \nB.  Country Initiatives  \n6.  The  country  initiatives  will  facilitate  the  adoption  of  elements  of  ADB\u2019s  approach  to \nsituations of fragility or post-conflict, and help operationalize the approach to enhance ADB\u2019s \nengagement.  The  country  initiatives  should  be  demand-driven  and  prepared  by  the  regional \nmissions or regional departments and the DMC counterparts concerned, with the assistance of the \nFSST at headquarters. Final proposals will be submitted to the FSST for review and endorsement. \nAs stated in this report (see paras. 11 and 12 of the main report), a two-pronged approach is \nproposed. It distinguishes between DMCs where ADB has an established field presence through a \nresident mission or office, and DMCs where the ADB presence is limited to a national liaison officer \nwithout resident mission or office.  \n1.  Generic Terms of Reference for Country Initiatives \n7.  Proposals will not be required to follow a specific format or template, but each proposal \nshould include at least a summary description of the following:  \n \n(i)  Issues and challenges to be addressed through the initiative. This section of \nthe  proposal  should  be  based  on  available  assessments  of  operational  risks, \ncountry  performance,  or  root  causes  of  fragility.  ADB\u2019s  approach  paper,  which \nidentifies the factors underlying weak performance, could be used as reference. The \ninitiative could have been prompted, for instance, by recognized weaknesses in \npolicy implementation and management capacity, country systems (as defined in \nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness), and project implementation / monitoring \ncapacity, or by the smallness and isolated condition of markets, or by physical and \nsocial disruptions linked to conflict. Where insufficient knowledge of fragility issues is \nan identified constraint, the initiative may consist of further analytic work\u2014such as a \npost-conflict needs assessment, a political economy study, or an assessment of \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \nbinding constraints on inclusive growth\u2014to inform the country partnership strategy \n(CPS) process or to support ADB\u2019s participation in a joint needs assessment.  \n \n(ii)  Relevance of ADB\u2019s approach and elements to be implemented through the \ninitiative. The proposal should identify those options or elements of the approach \nthat will be implemented to address the identified issues, and contribute to more \neffective ADB development interventions in the country. These options or elements \nmay include, among others, (a) adjusting ADB\u2019s strategy and modes of engagement \n(engagement models developed by the World Bank and the African Development \nBank, among others, could be used as reference); (b) strengthening ADB\u2019s field \npresence  and  project  monitoring  capacity;  (c) relaxing  business  process \nrequirements;  (d)  mobilizing  resources  for  capacity  development;  (e) enhancing \ndonor harmonization and alignment; and (f) developing new partnerships to improve \nprogram delivery. An explanation of how the initiative would promote principles of \ngood international engagement in fragile situations would be useful as well.  \n \n(iii)  Key activities and milestones. This section of the proposal should describe the \nmanner in which the initiative will be implemented, the key activities envisaged, the \nspecific results and outputs expected, and the monitoring methods. Initiatives should \nnormally  be  implemented  by  the  responsible  regional  department  or  regional \nmission and completed at least 3 months before the date of TA completion.  \n \n(iv)  Scope of services and terms of reference for consultants. Detailed terms of \nreference for each consultant, resource person, or expert will be included in the \nproposal, and a recruitment method (according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants [2007, as amended from time to time]) will be recommended.  \n \n(v)  Cost  estimates.  The  specific  amount  requested  from  the  TA  will  be  clearly \nidentified in the proposal. Given the pilot nature of the initiatives and their potentially \nlarge number, each initiative is expected not to exceed $100,000 in TA support. \nWhere feasible and appropriate, the FSST at headquarters could provide support for \nimplementing the initiative. \n8.  Country initiatives will be reviewed and selected on the basis of four main criteria: (i) clear \nidentification of the root cause of fragility and operational risks to be addressed; (ii) synergies with \nthe  current  CPS  or  use  in  formulating  or  revising  a  differentiated  operational  approach; \n(iii) advancement of the local aid effectiveness and harmonization agenda, including contribution to \nthe  strengthening  of  country  systems  and  capacity,  and  improvement  of  ADB\u2019s  portfolio \nperformance; and (iv) pilot nature, possible demonstration effect, and potential for knowledge \ncapture and dissemination. \n2.  Role of Experts for Country Initiatives (international, 6 person-months; national, \n60 person-months) \n9.  Consulting services required for the implementation of country initiatives will be determined \nfor each case. The terms of reference of each expert will be submitted as part of the country \ninitiatives, and reviewed and complemented as necessary, by the FSST at ADB headquarters. \nExperts may be drawn from a range of individual consultants, consulting firms, research institutes, \nacademic institutions, and nongovernment organizations. Under the supervision of the responsible \nADB officer in the regional mission or regional department, the experts will (i) contribute to the \nimplementation  of  country  initiatives  according  to  their  terms  of  reference;  (ii) coordinate  as \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n \n \nnecessary with the FSST at ADB headquarters; and (iii) report regularly on their assignments, \nthrough quarterly progress reports and a final report. \n \n10.  Depending on the scope of the individual country initiatives, the experts could be assigned \nto (i) monitor ADB operations considered at risk or requiring close supervision, for reasons of \nsecurity, remoteness, and isolation, among others; (ii) coordinate with government counterparts, \ndonor agencies, nongovernment organizations, and civil society to strengthen ADB\u2019s visibility and \npresence  in  aid  coordination  and  harmonization  initiatives;  (iii)  support  country  systems  and \ncapacity, including systems for procurement, financial management, social safeguards, project \nmanagement, and results-based monitoring and evaluation; (iv) carry out analytic work related to \nfragility, conflict assessments, and peace-building processes, in the framework of CPS preparation \nand  review,  among  others;  (v)  participate  in  joint  donor  programmatic  exercises  including \npost-conflict needs assessment; and (vi) advise on conflict-sensitive project design and monitoring \nsystems,  including  mechanisms  to  make  the  projects  more  inclusive  and  incorporate  peace \nbuilding into operations. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090415105220+08'00'", "Subject": "Regional\u2014Capacity Development Technical Assistance (R-CDTA)", "Author": "RR3", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word", "Keywords": "ADB\u2019s engagement in fragile situations, regional capacity devt technical assistance, adb R-CDTA, fragile situations support team, adb FSST, adb technical assistance 7269, adb project 42539", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090424115525+08'00'", "SourceModified": "D:20090415025156", "Title": "Supporting ADB\u2019s Engagement in Fragile Situations"}}
