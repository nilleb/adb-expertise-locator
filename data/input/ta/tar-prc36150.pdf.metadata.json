INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), during the 2002 Country Programming Mission, to provide technical \nassistance (TA) support to strengthen fiscal management as the PRC enters the third decade of \nits transition to a market economy. A Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in August 2002 and \nreached an understanding with the Government on the TA.1 The TA is included in the 2002 TA \nprogram. The logical framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Macroeconomic  management  and  the  fiscal  functions  of  the  Government  are  not \neffectively coordinated in PRC. Traditionally, much of the fiscal planning process had evolved \naround  the  needs  of  a  centrally  planned  economy,  with  limited  coordination  between  the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) and the State Development and Planning Commission (SDPC) at the \ncentral  level.  Until  the  initiation  of  reforms  in  1999,  spending  priorities  had  been  largely \ndetermined at the central level, with little discretion given to the line ministries in planning or \ndetermining  expenditures.  The  significant  support  provided  through  Government-directed \ninfrastructure investments or debt issuance to restructure the domestic banking sector has been \ntreated outside of the fiscal envelope, for purposes of policy formulation. The MOF has played a \nprimarily allocative role, along with some monitoring functions.  \n \n3.  Given the size of the PRC and its economy, public sector resource management and \nestablishment  of  overall  macroeconomic  and  strategic  priorities  have  posed  significant \nchallenges.  There  are  22  provinces  and  5  autonomous  regions,  each  with  an  average \npopulation of 45.3 million; and 4 municipalities in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing, \neach with an average population of 16.8 million. The PRC has 331 prefectural units, 2,109 \ncountry-level units, and 44,741 township-level units.  \n \n4.  Despite these issues, PRC has managed to keep budget deficits at a manageable level, \nclose to less than 1.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP) until 1996. Since 1997, however, \nfiscal deficits have grown, reaching 2.8% of GDP by 2000. While deficits declined slightly in \n2001, the upward trend continues, given the Government\u2019s expansionary fiscal stance in 1998-\n2002. For instance, three fiscal stimulus packages were introduced over 1998-20002 to cushion \nthe  impact  of  the  Asian  financial  contagion.  While  revenues,  supported  by  enhanced  tax \ncollection, increased from 12.1% of GDP in 1997 to 17.4% in 2001, public expenditures grew \nfaster, reaching 20% of GDP by 2000. In nominal terms, public expenditures grew at around \n6.5% annually over much of the 1990s. \n \n5.  While the PRC has embarked on commendable reforms in fiscal management, several \nissues need to be effectively addressed. First, the budget is not comprehensive. Under the \ncentrally planned system, the budget was treated as an accounting tool, capturing only part of \nthe resource allocations, with all major revenue and expenditure decisions taken as part of the \n5-year central plan. The revenue collection mechanism almost collapsed with the adoption of \nmarket-oriented reforms in the late 1970s. Overall Government revenue fell from 35% of GDP in \n1978 to 11.4% in 1996. The declining trend led all levels of government to impose a wide range \nof fees, levies, and surcharges to generate significant extrabudgetary funds (EBF) to offset the \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in July 2002. \n2  Together, they amounted to CNY360 billion ($43.5 billion): CNY100 billion in 1998, CNY110 billion in 1999, and \nCNY150 billion in 2000.  ", "2 \nrevenue  loss  and  growing  expenditure  responsibilities.  The  off-budget  revenues  and \nexpenditures  are  particularly  evident  at  the  lower  levels  of  government.  While  overall \ngovernment revenue had recovered to half of the pre-1980 levels by 2001 because of the fiscal \nreform initiatives adopted in 1999, EBFs have not declined in any significant manner. \n \n6.  Published data indicate that EBFs and off-budgetary expenditures grew from 2.6% of \nGDP in 1980 to 5.7% of GDP by 1996, before declining to 4.1% in 1999. Independent audits by \nMOF and the State General Audit Agency estimate these unauthorized funds and fees in the \nrange of 8-10% of GDP. At this magnitude, the rapidly growing EBFs and other off-budget \nfunds3 account for more than half of all consolidated resources of the Government. If quasi-\nfiscal  expenditures  such  as  directed  credit  to  state-owned  enterprises  were  added,  the \nGovernment\u2019s extra budgetary spending would be close to 24% of GDP. While EBFs have \nprovided  flexibility  to  finance  local  initiatives  without  having  to  seek  central  approvals  and \nallocations, they have impeded expenditure control, thus, adversely affecting macroeconomic \nmanagement. Off-budget spending has eroded fiscal discipline and significantly reduced the \noverall budgetary performance of the Government in relation to economic stabilization, regional \nequalization, and resource allocation. Fees and extra charges in health and education sectors, \nin  particular,  have  had  an  adverse  impact  on  the  poor.  Oversight,  transparency,  and \naccountability with regard to EBFs are limited.  \n \n7.  Second, budget preparation is not fully integrated with the fiscal cycle or the overall \nplanning process. It takes place late in the fiscal year, and is not well coordinated between the \ncentral, provincial, and subprovincial levels. As a result, the spending units do not receive their \nappropriations in time. Although the National People\u2019s Congress approves the overall budget, \nMOF engages in negotiations with the spending units and adjusts the budget throughout the \nfiscal year. The link between the budget and overall strategic priorities is weak. Annual budgets \nare prepared and implemented with a distinction between basic, recurrent expenditures and \nproject  outlays,  with  the  latter  including  both  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures.  Basic \nexpenditures are estimated through norms of the past and are seldom discussed or changed. \nMOF manages the recurrent budgets in relation to projects, while the SDPC deals with the \ncapital budgets. This poses coordination difficulties and impedes effective fiscal planning, since \nMOF does not play any role in determining new capital investments, but is presented with \ninformation on the recurrent needs only upon approval of the new projects. \n \n8.  Third, there is no effective framework to account for or analyze the contingent liabilities \nstemming from the quasi-fiscal operations to finance investment projects, social expenditure \nneeds  of  other  state-owned  entities,  and  the  implicit  pension  debt.  To  meet  the  financing \nrequirements, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) has lent more than CNY460 billion ($55.6 \nbillion) to the four state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) and over CNY1 trillion ($121billion) \nto the three policy banks. While directed credit has gradually declined, it still accounts for about \n3-5% of GDP at present. Overall public debt planning is not well integrated with fiscal policy. For \ninstance, the four asset management companies that operate at present, each established with \nCNY10 billion in operating capital, have issued interest-bearing bonds worth CNY820 billion to \nthe SOCBs and policy banks in return for over CNY580 billion of the loans extended by PBC. \n \n9.  Fourth, while significant tax reform measures have been introduced, revenue adequacy \ncontinues to be a problem. The formal tax system contributes only 16% to GDP and consists of \n                                                 \n3  In the PRC, EBFs comprise surtaxes, levies, and other types of user charges that various ministries, government \ndepartments, and administrative units can levy. All other funds are categorized as off-budget funds, including, self-\nraised funds, enterprise contributions to local and central governments, social security funds, and tax exemptions. ", "    3 \nvarious taxes that are distortionary in their impact. For instance, although enterprises in coastal \nareas have received favorable income tax treatments, the Government does not undertake \nperiodic assessments to determine whether tax rebates should be continued or eliminated in a \ntimely manner. Joint-venture enterprises enjoy tax benefits, while domestic enterprises in the \nsame sectors face unfair competition. Although provinces can determine the local tax rates, \nmost of the direct taxes and key indirect taxes have a narrow base and generate relatively little \ntax revenue except in the larger provinces or municipalities. \n \n10.  Fifth, while the fiscal decentralization process has reassigned revenues, it has paid \nlimited attention to the mounting expenditure burden at the provincial and subprovincial levels. \nThe dismantling of the central planning system led to major changes in the overall tax base and \nin the tax-sharing arrangements between the center and the provinces. In general, tax sharing is \nnot adequate and has over the years aggravated horizontal and vertical imbalances across \ndifferent  tiers  of  the  government,  and  distribution  of  revenues  has  generally  favored  rich \nlocalities. As provincial growth rates diverged during the transition, so have public expenditures. \nAs a result, regional disparities in fiscal spending and service provision are large by international \nstandards. The combination of heavy responsibilities and inadequate transfers has meant that \nthe levels of service provision vary considerably in line with local economic potential. Local \ngovernments in the poorer regions are unable to fulfill their expenditure responsibilities, and \nprovide inadequate levels of vital public services. These problems call for rationalization of \nintergovernment fiscal transfers. \n \n11.  Sixth, there is lack of coordination in formulating fiscal and monetary policies. At a basic \nlevel, MOF aims at lower interest rates on Government securities to lower the cost of financing. \nAlthough there is an auction system in place for the sale of securities, there is also an implicit \nceiling on the interest rates. This deters PBC\u2019s role in effective monetary policy formulation and \ncoordination. While PBC prescribes a floating interest rate system and short-term rolling over of \ndebt, MOF has issued fixed-coupon securities, which may increase the long-term risks faced by \nthe commercial banks that hold these instruments. There is no integrated approach in place to \nevaluate the implications of debt issuance through treasury securities versus lending through \nSOCBs for long-term fiscal and monetary policies. \n \n12.  Finally,  budget  execution  suffers  from  significant  weaknesses.  The  current  internal \ncontrol systems are not designed to effectively trace the use of funds. In addition to leakages \nstemming from the recourse to EBFs, system wastage and misuse of contingency funds occur. \nThere is no capacity to assess the veracity of the final statements produced by the departments \nwithin MOF and the provincial finance bureaus (PFBs). These constraints have reduced the \ncredibility of fiscal reporting and internal controls. \n \n13.  Recognizing these difficulties, the Government has undertaken a number of key reforms. \nSince the late 1990s, with advisory support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the \nWorld Bank (WB), public expenditure management has received high priority as part of the \noverall  budget  reform  package.  This  package  includes  the  enactment  of  the  Budget  Law, \nintroduction of new procedures for budget preparation and approval, adoption of a new budget \nclassification scheme, and strengthening of audit practices. MOF has been restructured, and a \ntreasury department was established in 2000. It has introduced measures to consolidate all \nbudgetary transactions into a treasury single account, and a pilot is under way in six key central-\nlevel agencies. ADB\u2019s past TAs have supported an evaluation of subprovincial fiscal relations \nand efforts to reduce EBFs at the central level. WB undertook a public expenditure review in \n2000 and a study on intergovernmental fiscal relations in 2002, both of which have highlighted \nthe constraints outlined above. The Government has sought the proposed TA to enhance ", "4 \nmacroeconomic and fiscal coordination and strengthen internal controls. ADB will coordinate \nwith IMF and WB in implementing the TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The goal of the TA is to strengthen fiscal management in the PRC. This is to be \nachieved by (i) improving macroeconomic and fiscal coordination to meet national strategic \npriorities  leading  to  a  fair  and  equitable  distribution  of  growth  across  the  provinces;  and \n(ii) instituting sound internal control systems to ensure that the budget is executed effectively. \nThe outputs include (i) recommendations to MOF and the State Council for improving the \nlinkage between established policy priorities, and budget formulation and resource allocation in \nkey sectors; and (ii) redesigned internal control systems within MOF and PFBs to improve the \nuse of budgetary funds. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The TA will have two components. The key activities are listed under each. \n \n1.  Component A: Strengthening Macroeconomic and fiscal Coordination \n(i)  Provide overall institutional capacity building support to enhance coordination \nbetween macroeconomic priorities and fiscal policy formulation. \n(ii)  Enhance the interface between MOF and the line ministries to strengthen budget \nformulation and execution. \n(iii)  Evaluate budgetary and off-budgetary allocations to eliminate support to state \nactivities that crowd out the private sector. \n(iv)  Streamline EBFs to improve the linkage between expenditures and strategic \npriorities. \n(v)  Recommend measures to rationalize expenditure and revenue assignments at all \nlevels of the government, based on efficiency (choice and economies of scale) \nand equity (access) considerations, to align macroeconomic priorities and fiscal \nfunctions. \n(vi)  From work already undertaken by MOF, assess the current tax and fiscal levy \npolicies and tax-revenue sharing arrangements to improve income redistribution \nacross provinces. \n(vii)  Support the transition to medium-term budget planning to strengthen the link \nbetween macroeconomic planning, fiscal policy formulation, and budgeting.  \n(viii)  Develop  a  sound  methodology  and  implementation  framework  for  effectively \nintegrating  quasi-fiscal  means  of  financing  and  other  contingent  liabilities  in \nformulating the medium-term budget. \n(ix)  Evaluate  the  coordination  between  MOF  and  PBC  in  formulating  fiscal  and \nmonetary  policies,  and  prepare  a  position  paper  with  recommendations  and \nappropriate institutional arrangements to achieve greater coordination. \n(x)  Through  in-country  and  external  training  seminars,  enhance  the  skills  and \ncapacity of policy and budget officials in MOF and selected key ministries in \nmacroeconomic and fiscal coordination and medium-term budget planning.  \n(xi)  Design for the State Council\u2019s consideration, a comprehensive strategy for fiscal \nmanagement focused on achieving market economic objectives through efficient \nuse of fiscal policy tools. ", "    5 \n2.  Component B: Instituting Sound Internal Controls and Audit on Budget \nUtilization  \n \n(i)  Institute an effective internal control system in MOF and the PFBs of three \nselected  provinces  to  strengthen  budget  preparation  and  execution,  control \nEBFs, improve monitoring of treasury operations, and enhance fund tracing.  \n(ii)  Enhance the integrity and consistency of internal audits, with effective reporting \nto the senior management of MOF and PFBs.  \n(iii)  Strengthen the interface between the internal supervision departments and other \nline departments within MOF and PFBs as well as between MOF/PFBs and the \nother line ministries to enhance coordination in monitoring budget execution at all \nlevels. \n(iv)  Enhance the skills and capacity of financial controllers and auditors in MOF and \nthe selected PFBs through in-country training seminars. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,155,000 equivalent. ADB will provide \n$875,000 on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program comprising the entire foreign \nexchange cost of $634,000 and the local currency cost of $241,000 equivalent. Component A \nwill be allocated $575,000 equivalent and component B, $300,000 equivalent. Overall, the \nGovernment will contribute $280,000 equivalent by providing counterpart facilities. Detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will engage a team of three international consultants to provide 17 person-\nmonths of advisory services and 4 domestic experts to provide 18 person-months of services. \nAll will be recruited individually, in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. Their expertise will \ncover macroeconomic and fiscal coordination, tax and fiscal levy review, and internal control \nand audit functions. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA is \nexpected to begin in January 2003, and will be implemented over a period of 15 months. Any \nnecessary equipment will be procured in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n18.  The International Department of MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and the \nPolicy and Fiscal Affairs Department and the Supervision and Inspection Department of MOF \nwill be the Implementing Agencies for components A and B, respectively. The executing and \nimplementing agencies will ensure smooth implementation of the TA and coordinate with all \nrelevant agencies, including PBC. MOF will provide the necessary counterpart facilities and will \nfacilitate the consultants\u2019 liaison with local governments, relevant agencies and organizations. \nAn advance payment facility will be instituted to support the Government in organizing the \nexternal study visits.  \n \nIV.
