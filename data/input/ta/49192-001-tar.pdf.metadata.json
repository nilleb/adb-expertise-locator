INTRODUCTION \n1.  At the request of the Government of Mongolia for supporting private sector development \nin rural areas, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) carried out a fact-finding mission in May \n2015. Following the fact-finding mission, ADB and the government reached an understanding \non the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, terms of reference, and costs of the \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA). The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A recent significant increase in mining in Mongolia has underpinned rapid economic \ngrowth, with gross domestic product having risen at an average annual rate of 12% from 2011 \nto 2014. However, mining is capital-intensive and employs less than 4% of the workforce. The \neconomy is now vulnerable to downturns in energy and mineral prices and mining investment. \nAgriculture remains the largest source of employment (employing one-third of the workforce), \ngenerates one-sixth of gross domestic product, and is the main source of livelihood in rural \nareas. To achieve inclusive growth, it is important to balance the promotion of mining with \nefforts to develop agriculture and other competitive nonmining sectors. Economic diversification \nwill help reduce economic vulnerability and sustain job creation.  \n \n3.  The rural economy of Mongolia is heavily dependent on three sectors: agriculture, retail \ntrade and manufacturing. There are over 23,900 formal businesses active in the rural areas, of \nwhich 32% operate in retail trade, 12% in agriculture, and 9% in manufacturing. Agricultural and \nrelated manufacturing activities include wool and cashmere cleansing, skin and leather crafting, \nand seabuckhthorn, meat and dairy products processing, animal husbandry, and wheat and \nother crops.  \n \n4.  Mongolia\u2019s rural economy is, however, constrained by a lack of experience in private \nsector development, and low penetration of business and technical skills such as financial \nliteracy. Limited local capacity and expertise render herders, farmers and rural enterprises \nunable  to  market  products  or  undertake  robust  economic  and  financial  analyses,  prepare \nbusiness plans and cash-flow projections, or conduct market research on their own. Their main \nassets, notably livestock and remote land, are also poor sources of collateral. These limitations \nreduce the interest of banks and other sources of finance. A recent survey of small and medium \nenterprises (across urban and rural areas) reported that 47% of male and 36% of female \nentrepreneurs  identified  access  to  finance  as  a  critical  challenge  for  development  of  their \nbusinesses.2 Weak technical skills make it difficult to enter into contracts, address taxation and \nother regulatory requirements, and resolve legal problems. \n \n5.  Furthermore,  Mongolia\u2019s  border  trade  and  food  sanitation  requirements  are  overly \ncomplex and inconsistent with those of its two neighbors, the People\u2019s Republic of China and \nthe Russian Federation. In terms of trading across borders, Mongolia has been ranked 74th out \nof 189 countries.3 \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 September 2015. The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Mongolia (2015).   \n2  International Finance Corporation. 2014. SMEs and Women-owned SMEs in Mongolia Market Research Study. \nWashington, DC.   \n3  World Bank Group. 2015. Doing Business 2016: Measuring Regulatory Quality and Efficiency. Washington, DC.   \n ", "2   \n6.  Finally, inadequate infrastructure also hampers the development of Mongolia\u2019s rural \neconomy. As a large landlocked country, Mongolia faces high transit costs and low reliability of \nlogistics chains, which constrain the country's competitiveness and limit regional integration. \nTransport costs to the People\u2019s Republic of China and Russia are high, transit times long, and \nlogistics within Mongolia relatively inefficient. Of the 10 topics in the ranking in Doing Business \n2016, getting electricity was ranked the lowest (134th out of 189 countries).4 Mongolia has been \nranked 112th out of 144 countries for infrastructure quality, and 120th out of 160 countries for \ninfrastructure logistics performance.5 These problems are especially severe in the rural western \nregion,  where  remoteness  from  political  and  economic  centers,  long  distances  between \ntownships, a low population density, and a shortage of economic hubs make infrastructure \ndevelopment costly.  \n \n7.  The three rural western aimags or provinces\u2014Bayan-Ulgii, Khovd, and Uvs\u2014are among \nthe most underdeveloped in the country.6 In 2014, the unemployment rate was 22.5% in Bayan-\nUlgii, 11.7% in Khovd, and 14.8% in Uvs, well above the national rate of 7.9%. In 2014, these \nthree  aimags  only  produced  4.1%  of  gross  domestic  product,  yet  accounted  for  8.3%  of \nMongolia\u2019s total population and 12.2% of its land area. Western Mongolia has relied on cheap \nnatural resources as the basis for the little industrial activity that exists. Thus, an abundance of \nland became the source of a livestock industry, which in turn led to meat processing, cashmere \nand wool production, and hides and skins. There is little opportunity for expanding the number \nof livestock because of overgrazing and desertification. Better use needs to be made of the \nregion\u2019s resources if the rural economy is to diversify and expand. \n \n8.  The western region has the potential to develop new value-added economic activities \nbased on agriculture. An abundance of natural resources and livestock (around 12 million head), \nborders with the People\u2019s Republic of China and Russian Federation, and a potential market for \ntourism and other services offer opportunities for economic growth under the right policies and \ninstitutions. This will require an increased focus on (i) the development of infrastructure, (ii) the \ntechnical expertise required by the private sector, and (iii) cooperation among the aimags.  \n \n9.  The poverty rate in western Mongolia declined from 52.7% in 2010 to 26.0% in 2014 \nlargely due to increased activities in agriculture and retail trade. In terms of ease of doing \nbusiness,  Uvs  is  ranked  11th,  Khovd  eighth,  and  Bayan-Ulgii  third  among  Mongolia\u2019s  21 \naimags.7 This demonstrates the western region\u2019s commitment to achieving economic growth \nthrough private sector development.  \n \n10.  ADB is currently helping to upgrade infrastructure in western  Mongolia through the \nWestern Regional Road Corridor Development Project, which supports the development of 111 \nkilometers of the region\u2019s main road corridor, first in Khovd then in Bayan-Ulgii.8 This corridor will \n(i)  provide  a  vital  link  to  economic  opportunities  and  social  services,  (ii)  improve  the \ncompetitiveness of the region\u2019s exports, and (iii) reduce the high costs of imports needed for \nproduction. \n                                                \n4  World Bank Group. 2015.

Other development partners are providing very limited assistance to the private sector, \nwith only two bilateral organizations implementing TA projects in western Mongolia. The Swiss \nAgency for Development and Cooperation is helping local governments improve the capacity of \nherder cooperatives, while German Development Cooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft \nf\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit is providing a capacity building TA to micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprises operating in Uvs. The TA will mitigate this shortage and create a \nmore favorable environment for private sector development by supporting partnerships between \nthe government and private sector.  \n \n12.  The aimag governments lack the specialist human resources and financial capacity \nneeded to support private sector development. Their ability to prepare a regional private sector \ndevelopment strategy and to plan and evaluate its implementation is insufficient. Much can be \ndone to promote balanced economic development in western Mongolia by addressing these \ncapacity  gaps.  Moreover,  a  well-functioning  set  of  institutional  arrangements  for  regional \neconomic  cooperation  among  the three  western  aimags  is missing.  Enhanced  cooperation \nwould  provide  synergies  in  facilitation  of  the  private  sector.  It  would  also  improve  the \ncoordination of public investment, thereby ensuring a more efficient allocation and use of the \nscarce public resources in rural areas. The TA will draw on successful examples from other \ncountries,  as  well  as  lessons  learned  from  ADB  support  for  private  sector  development \nprograms in developing member countries. Furthermore, to capitalize on earlier work, maximum \nuse will be made of assistance from ADB and other development partners. \n \n13.  The proposed TA will support private sector development in the rural western region. \nThe TA will help address the constraints to private sector development that can be alleviated at \nthe local level. It will strengthen coordination between the three western aimags, with a focus on \nimproving access to export markets. It will also improve the investment and market analysis \ncapacity of businesses, aimag authorities, and other stakeholders.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the TA is aligned with the government\u2019s goal of enhancing economic \ndiversification in agriculture and other nonmining industries in western Mongolia.9 The outcome \nwill be enhanced readiness for value-added activities in private sector development in the three \nwestern aimags. Performance will be assessed from a private sector development strategy \nsubmitted to local aimag governments for endorsement by 2017. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will extend ADB\u2019s engagement with private sector development in Mongolia to \nthe local government level, with a focus on Bayan-Ulgii, Khovd, and Uvs. Specifically, the TA \nwill (i) help local governments promote value-added agriculture and tourism activities, and (ii) \nhelp build the capacity of local governments and nonmining private sector participants, including \nvalue-chains for investment planning and market analysis through a learning-by-doing approach \nand  in-house  training  sessions  addressing  capacity  and  institutional  development  while \nemphasizing project preparation. \n                                                \n9  For a discussion of the government\u2019s goal for and plans in the western region, see Government of Mongolia, \nCabinet Secretariat. 2005.

Output 1 will be the assessment of the aimags\u2019 economic competitiveness and potential. \nThis will provide a building block for other outputs. The assessment will identify the constraints \nin each aimag to expanding the private sector, such as access to infrastructure and finance, \ngaps in business and technical skills, trade restrictions, and inexperience within government in \nfacilitating private sector development. It will focus on the potential for private sector led value-\nadded activities in agriculture as well as tourism in each aimag suited to their natural resources \nand other sources of competitive advantage.  \n \n17.  Output 2 will be the assessment of the readiness of each aimag. This output will (i) \nassess the skills in each aimag among businesses and the labor force required to develop \npriority sectors, including private sector led value-added activities in agriculture (ii) assess the \ncapacity of each aimag government to manage a pro-growth economic policy in the context of \nprivate sector development, and (iii) prepare a study of public infrastructure needs, with an \nemphasis on transport, in western Mongolia. This output will help local governments establish (i) \nevidence-based policy-making practices, (ii) training modules for vocational training institutes, \nand (iii) on-the-job training for businesses. \n \n18.  Output 3 will be the preparation of robust investment and market analyses for selected \nprojects  in  priority  sectors.  This  output  will  (i)  produce  investment  and  market  studies  for \nselected private sector opportunities in priority sectors with a focus on value-added activities \nand exports, and (ii) train private sector participants in qualitative and quantitative research \nmethodologies and financing plans. Government officials will help review investment and market \nstudies and identify the supporting actions the government and ADB can take, such as in \ninfrastructure development. They will also join training events in order to develop their skills in \nfacilitating private sector development.  \n \n19.  Output 4 will be the strengthening of coordination and information sharing for economic \ncooperation  among  the  three  western  aimags.  This  output  will  (i)  establish  institutional \narrangements  and  facilitate  collaborative  planning  among  the  aimags,  and  (ii)  support  the \nformulation  of  a  regional  private  sector  development  strategy.  Regional  conferences  will \nunderpin the building of an institutional arrangement that will help local governments formulate \ndevelopment strategies and enhance coordination. The output will also include an international \nstudy tour to demonstrate how other governments develop environments that attract private \nsector participants such as investors.  \n \n20.  Government officials will lead the design and implementation of key initiatives, with TA \nconsultants playing an active supporting role. Thus, the TA will provide an important learning-\nby-doing exercise that will (i) build internal capacity, (ii) strengthen the operational framework, \nand  (iii)  sustain  the  TA  results.  The  TA  will  also  apply  a  participatory  approach  to  the \npreparation of outputs, such as by supporting collective focus group discussions and workshops \nfor officials and stakeholders.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $865,000, of which $815,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, meeting and workshop venues, \nand other in-kind contributions. Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with the \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The  Cabinet  Secretariat  of  Mongolia  will  be  the  executing  agency.  Local  aimag \ngovernments in Bayan-Ulgii, Khovd, and Uvs will be the implementing agencies and will (i) \nsupervise the day-to-day work of the consultants, and (ii) assume overall responsibility for \nseminars and workshops. A project steering committee composed of the Cabinet Secretariat, \naimag  governments,  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mongolian  National  Chamber  of  Commerce  and \nIndustry, and Economic Policy and Competitiveness Research Center will be established to \nguide the TA.10 The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from December 2015 to December \n2017.    \n \n23.  The TA will engage up to 67 person-months of international and national consultants. All \nconsultants will be recruited individually. The international consultants will include (i) a private \nsector development advisor and team leader, and (ii) an agribusiness specialist, for a total of 17 \nperson-months. The national consultants will include (i) a project management specialist and \ndeputy team leader; (ii) a capacity building and business development specialist; and (iii) three \ntechnical specialists in areas such as law, meat processing, and the production of leather and \nskins,  for  up  to  50  person-months.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  the  recruitment  of \nconsultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n24.  All relevant government departments and divisions will participate actively in the TA. The \nTA will also be implemented in close coordination with related rural development projects in \nwestern Mongolia supported by ADB and other partners. Development partners\u2019 outputs related \nto the private sector will be used to formulate a private sector development strategy in each \naimag, and outreach activities will help ensure these partners\u2019 understanding and engagement. \n \n25.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed timeline and budget allocation. To support \nmonitoring and evaluation, the consultant team will submit inception, midterm, draft final, and \nfinal reports to the government and ADB. TA review missions will monitor progress, assess \nperformance, and ensure relevance. \n \n26.  The  key  risks  are  that  (i)  political  uncertainty  weakens  the  government\u2019s  ability  to \npromote private sector development in rural areas, (ii) turnover in key staff reduces ownership \nand institutional memory, (iii) weak public sector capacity delays implementation, (iv) political \npressure erodes the aimags\u2019 willingness to coordinate, and (v) changing market conditions \nreduce the relevance of the assessments. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n27.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $815,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for Fostering Value-Added Activities in Western Mongolia, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n10  The Cabinet Secretariat is responsible for the administration of the Government of Mongolia and assists in \ngovernmental decision making by (i) facilitating intergovernment agencies and line ministries, and (ii) providing \nguidance and recommendations regarding policy formulation and implementation.
