INTRODUCTION \n1.   The Government of Sri Lanka requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to help the government develop a national master \nplan for its port sector, including the restructuring of Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA). This is \nthe first ADB intervention in Sri Lanka\u2019s port sector since the Colombo Port Expansion Project \nclosed in July 2013.1 The concept for this TA was approved by ADB Management on 10 June \n2016. An ADB fact-finding mission was conducted from 26 May to 3 June 2016 where key \naspects  of  the  TA  were  discussed  with  officials  of  the  government,  SLPA,  and  other \nstakeholders. This report is based on the consensus reached with the government and SLPA \nregarding the TA framework, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \noutline terms of reference for consulting services.2 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.   As Sri Lanka is an island nation, maritime transport is essential for the nation. It is the \ndominant transport mode for international trade and accounts for a large share of the country\u2019s \ninternational logistics cost. Low-cost logistics is critical to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic efficiency and \ntransition  to  an  export-oriented  economy  because  it  affects  both  the  competitiveness  of \nexported goods  and  consumer  price  of  imported goods  of the country.  Sri  Lanka  plays  a \nsignificant role as a regional transport hub due to its strategic location in the vicinity of major \ninternational shipping routes. Ports and shipping are central to the economic ties between Sri \nLanka and the rest of the world, including South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nnations.3 \n3.   Sri  Lanka  needs  to  keep  strengthening  its  ports\u2019  capacity  and  competitiveness  by \nimproving infrastructure, operational efficiency, and institutions, in order to maintain its role as a \nregional  transport  hub  despite  severe  competition  with  the  ports  of  other  nations.4 The \nintroduction of larger vessels and the emergence of gigantic container shipping line alliances \nhave exacerbated the competition between international ports. Due to Sri Lanka\u2019s national \neconomic growth and the rapid growth of international container shipping demand, the country \nurgently needs to strengthen its port capacity. Being left behind these recent trends will lead to \nthe loss of economic opportunities and growth impediments in the South Asia Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation region.    \n4.   The  Colombo  port  became the  world\u2019s  83rd busiest  port  in terms  of total shipping \ntonnage and the world\u2019s 35th busiest container port in 2014.5 From 2005\u20132015, total container \nvolume handled in Sri Lanka ports increased by 111%, from 2.5 million twenty-foot equivalent \nunits to 5.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units.6 Due to the rapid growth of vessel size, vessel \ncalls recorded only a 15% increase during the same period. More than 75% of total container \ncargos are transshipment containers, mostly from or to the Indian subcontinent. The Colombo \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Sri Lanka \nfor the Colombo Port Expansion Project. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 June 2016.  \n3  Member countries are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.  \n4  The six ports under the Sri Lanka Ports Authority are Colombo, Trincomalee, Hambantota, Galle, Oluvil, and \nKankasanthurai. \n5  American  Association  of  Port  Authorities.  World  Port  Rankings  2014.  http://www.aapa-\nports.org/unifying/content.aspx?ItemNumber=21048 (accessed 29 July 2016). \n6  Twenty-foot equivalent unit is a standard unit to describe volume of container cargo. A forty-foot container cargo is \ncounted as two twenty-foot equivalent units. ", "2   \nport handles more than 90% of the total cargo volume in the country, including 8 million metric \ntons of non-containerized cargo, which is equivalent to 22% of the port\u2019s total cargo volume.  \n5.   In spite of the needs for capacity strengthening, the Colombo port is constrained due to \nthe urbanization of and growing congestion in Colombo City. The Colombo port development \nmust cope with urban development on the land side. At the same time, the Colombo port cannot \naccommodate all development needs due to its limited port area inside the breakwaters. Hence, \ncargo handling capacity for container, dry bulk, liquid bulk, automobile, and other types of cargo, \nas well as passengers, needs to be strategically allocated to other ports to alleviate growing \npressures on the Colombo port and facilitate national economic growth. Port development \ndirection must be properly determined with full consideration of the economies of scale, the size \nof the port hinterland, potential demand, and connection to other transport networks. Also, \ndeveloping  local  ports  is  vital  for  economic  growth,  and  will  contribute  to  addressing  the \nsignificant economic divide among the regions in the nation.  \n6.   Trincomalee City, situated on the eastern shoreline, is the capital of Sri Lanka\u2019s Eastern \nProvince,  which  is  one  of  the  nation\u2019s  most  underdeveloped  provinces.  The  city  is  still \nrecovering from the prolonged ethnic conflict that ended in 2009. The Trincomalee port currently \nhandles bulk cargo only, but its total cargo-handling volume is the second largest in the nation. \nThe Trincomalee port has a number of potential advantages including its geographical location, \nbeing situated within a deep and spacious harbor near the southern boundary of the Bay of \nBengal.  As  Trincomalee  area  has  been  identified  as  a  zone  that  could  be  developed  as \nagricultural and energy hubs under the development program of the present government, the \nTrincomalee  port  development  needs  to  be  sufficiently  discussed  and  planned  along  with \ndiscussions about the direction of the urban development.  \n7.   Maritime related industries have not yet grown in the country, although the Colombo port \nis a dominant container hub port in South Asia. In comparison, Singapore has a diverse and \nlarge cluster of maritime industries including shipbuilding, ship registration, bunkering, trade \ncredit  insurance,  vessel  charter  market,  logistics,  consulting,  and  international  maritime \narbitration. The presence of such a cluster reinforces its function and attractiveness as a hub \nport. Sri Lanka\u2019s ports need a strategy to foster such auxiliary functions.  \n8.   Efficiency improvement in operations is another agenda in the port sector. The SLPA is \na  statutory  corporation  established  under  the  SLPA  Act  of  1979  as  the  owner,  operator, \nregulator, and supplier of marine and cargo handling services at the ports. SLPA is complex, \nlarge, and inefficient in comparison with other competing international port operators. As of \nDecember 2013, SLPA employees are no fewer than 9,900, and around 8,900 serves at the \nColombo  port.  Build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  concessions  have  been  applied  to  some  container \nterminals,  which  led  to  alleviation  of  the  financial  burden  and  efficient  operations.  Further \ninstitutional strengthening, including the restructuring of SLPA, needs to be sought with full \nconsideration of a level playing field for all terminal operators, financial strength, efficiency, and \ncompetitiveness of Sri Lanka\u2019s ports.  \n9.   Mitigation of environmental impacts of the port operations to surrounding residential and \ncommercial areas, including vibration, noise, and odor, is critical for the sustainability of the \nColombo port. As cargo volume grows and urbanization continues, coexistence of port and \nurban activities is tested and requires alleviation of the impacts. Congestion attributed to port \ntraffic  also  requires  harmonization  of  port  and  urban  development.  As  Sri  Lanka  aims  to \ntransform to an export-oriented economy, the multimodal transport network plying ports and \nindustrial zones must be strengthened and industrialization promoted.  ", "  3 \n10.    Under these circumstances, the preparation of a master plan for the port sector was \nlisted in the Ministry-wise Program of the government in 2015.7 Given that SLPA recognizes its \nlack of capacity to develop a master plan, this TA will support the Government of Sri Lanka to \ndevelop  the  National  Port  Master  Plan  (NPMP)  and  identify  priority  projects,  which  will \ncontribute to scaling up future ADB interventions in the nation. At the same time, the TA will \ntechnically support the government to coordinate with the road sector and ensure that the \noperation and development of the Colombo port in future will not be unduly constrained by the \nplanned road development which will run through the port. \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.   The  impact  will  be  the  realization  of  the most  competitive  and  preferred  ports  and \nshipping destination in the region, in line with the Public Investment Programme, 2016\u20132018.8 \nThe outcome will be harmonized and balanced port development facilitated in the nation.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   Output 1: National Port Master Plan finalized for approval. The NPMP will have two \nsections: (i) National Policy Directions, and (ii) individual port development plans. The National \nPolicy Directions will contain visions, policies, institutional issues, and overall development \nframework from a national point of view, including the restructuring of SLPA. The individual port \ndevelopment plans will set the direction of development and identify priority projects for the \nColombo and Trincomalee ports. \n \n13.   The NPMP will ensure that port infrastructure is developed and operated in an optimum \nmanner,  in  coexistence  with  urban  areas  and  in  line  with  long-term  planning.  Hence,  in \ndeveloping  the  NPMP,  ample  consideration  will  be  given  to  harmonization  with  urban \ndevelopment,  hinterland  economy,  industries,  and multimodal transport  network  as  well  as \nfuture port expansion. The NPMP will also identify priority projects, promote public and private \ninvestment, and boost economic efficiency by reducing logistics cost along with the restructuring \nof SLPA.  \n \n14.   The National Policy Directions will include the (i) future visions of Sri Lanka\u2019s port sector; \n(ii) market analyses of the auxiliary functions of container hub ports; (iii) market analyses of non-\ncontainer strategic cargo; (iv) future cargo and passenger demand estimation with a 30-year \nplanning horizon; (v) designation of the key functions of ports under SLPA; (vi) trade facilitation; \n(vii)  prioritized  projects;  (viii)  study  of  the  SLPA  restructuring,  including  separation  of  the \nregulatory and operational functions; and (ix) study of the multimodal hinterland connectivity and \nlogistics. Restructuring of SLPA will lead to economic efficiency improvement by strengthening \nthe sector institutions and will be the most significant institutional change since its establishment \nin 1979. \n \n15.   The individual port development plans will include (i) traffic forecast of the port, (ii) \nassessment of port operations and infrastructure, (iii) clarifying development and improvement \n                                                \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n7m  Gemovbeernrsm, eBnot aorfd S orif  LDairnekcat,o Drse,p Maratmnaengte omf eNnat,t ioonr asl taPflfa,n annindg .m Maiyn ibstery p oref lNimaitnioanrayl  iPno nliaciteusr ea.n  d Economic Affairs. \n2015.

The priority projects identified in the TA will be further prepared by financing the \ndetailed design and preparing bidding documents under a proposed TA loan.9 \n \n16.   The  NPMP  is  designed  to  support  the government  to  accomplish the  Ministry-wise \nProgramme. The government is committed to implementing the NPMP which will be an official \ndocument to direct SLPA operation and port development with endorsement by the Parliament. \nThe NPMP will be maintained and periodically updated by SLPA.  \n \n17.   Output 2: Technical review of the final design of the port access elevated highway \nsubmitted. This output will support SLPA to conduct the technical verification of the design of \nthe port access elevated highway (PAEH) and other engineering issues to secure an efficient \nport operation.10 The Colombo port has only one access road connecting it with Colombo City \nso that this road is essential for the efficient operation of the port. As the Road Development \nAuthority is planning to construct the PAEH, which will run through the port and beyond the \nexisting access road, technical verification is needed from the point of view of the port operation. \nThis component provides review of the design and other technical documents of the PAEH, and \nassistance to SLPA to coordinate with other agencies through a multiagency committee, i.e., \npreparation of reports and presentations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.   The TA is estimated to cost $1,900,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office \nsupplies, and other in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.   The  executing  agency  will  be  the  SLPA.  The  executing  agency  will  provide  policy \nguidance and national-level coordination in relation to the TA and ensuing projects, and be \nresponsible for managing daily implementation activities. A TA advisory committee headed by \nSLPA\u2019s managing director will be established within SLPA to guide and provide support to the \nTA team for smooth implementation. SLPA will appoint a project director to supervise the \nconsultant team, and six supporting team members to work with the consultant. The supporting \nteam members will contribute to data collection, drafting reports, analyses, and other relevant \ntasks, subject to its capacity. The TA will be implemented over 24 calendar-months, starting \nfrom November 2016 to November 2018. \n20.   ADB will engage an international consulting firm through the quality- and cost-based \nselection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. The firm will be selected by full technical \nproposals. The TA will require about 47 person-months of international consulting services and \n20 person-months of national consulting services in total to deliver the TA outputs.

Under the proposed TA loan for Transport Project Preparatory Facility, the detailed design \nand other preparation works will be prepared. ", "  5 \nconsulting service period for the firm will be 18 months. The required experts for the consulting \nfirm  will  be  a  senior  port  engineer,  maritime  transport  specialist,  economic  assessment \nspecialist,  financial  specialist,  trade  facilitation  specialist,  public  administration  specialist, \nenvironment  specialist,  port  engineer,  port  operation  specialist,  information  technology \nspecialist, and social safeguard specialist. Individual consultants as reviewers will be recruited \nfor 2 person-months to support the executing agency on technical matters, including validation \nof deliverables by the consulting firm. The outline terms of reference for consultants is in \nAppendix 3. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). Advance contracting for the recruitment of consultants will be used \nto expedite the implementation.    \n21.   During implementation, five workshops will be held in Colombo and Trincomalee to \nfacilitate incorporation of the views and requests from related agencies, port users, and other \nstakeholders, and to disseminate the NPMP to them. All TA-financed goods and equipment will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime).  The  procured  equipment  will  be  handed  over  to  the  executing  agency  upon  TA \ncompletion. \n22.   A review of the TA will be undertaken after 6 months of implementation to assess the \nprogress, fine-tune the outputs, and make necessary adjustments, if any, to the key activities \nand implementation arrangements. Good practices and lessons will be disseminated through \nknowledge products and outputs available on the ADB website, as applicable. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.
