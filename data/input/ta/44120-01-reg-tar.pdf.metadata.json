INTRODUCTION \n1.  The key procurement principles in the Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time) and the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are (i) eligibility, (ii) economy and efficiency, (iii) fairness, \n(iv) transparency, and (v) promotion of domestic industries. The business opportunities outreach \ninitiatives (BOOI) proposed in this regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) will \nbenefit developing member countries by enhancing competition in ADB-financed procurement \nand recruitment of consultants, promoting cost-effectiveness, and building capacity.1 They will \nalso reinforce ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) which aims to (i) support \ncompetitive markets and effective public administration, (ii) support explicit anticorruption efforts \nand combat fraud and corruption, and (iii) ensure that all individuals and firms involved in ADB-\nfinanced projects adhere to the highest ethical standards.  \n \n2.  Significant portions of ADB loan, grant, and TA proceeds are used to fund procurement \nof goods, works, and consultant services. In order to be successful in ADB-funded projects, \ncontractors and consultants need to (i) be aware of how to locate and pursue ADB business \nopportunities, and (ii) become familiar with ADB procurement policies and procedures. The \nBOOI will provide a range of tools to support potential contractors and consultants to gain this \nknowledge. \n \n3.  Typically,  national  chambers  of  commerce,  consulting  and  contractor  associations, \nfederations of industries, and ministries of trade have approached ADB through its Board of \nDirectors to provide BOOI. To date, this has been limited to conducting business opportunities \nseminars in ADB member countries. The demand for seminars has been increasing, especially \nin borrowing member countries, where national industries strive to increase their participation in \nADB-financed  projects.  In  nonborrowing  member  countries,  the  recent  financial  crisis  has \nincreased the interest of contractors and consultants in either establishing or consolidating their \nbusiness relationships with ADB. \n \n4.   This TA will expand the scope of BOOI interventions by adopting a more proactive and \nsystematic approach to supporting contractor and consultant access to public sector contracting \nopportunities funded by ADB over a 3-year period from March 2010 to December 2012.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.   Although  the  business  opportunities  seminars  and  the  more  recent  business \nopportunities fair2 have been useful information-sharing and public relations events, there is a \nneed to broaden the tools available to respond to clients' needs and to monitor the effect of \nthese initiatives.  \n \n6.  The need to develop a wider range of BOOI tools is driven by (i) changes in the global \nbusiness environment, (ii) the emergence and availability of new information technologies, and \n(iii) more sophisticated client needs. This requires a variety of tailor-made BOOI tools so ADB \ncan be more effective and efficient in addressing the demands of the business community.   \n \n7.  Since  1985,  over  13,000  prospective  suppliers,  manufacturers,  contractors,  and \nconsultants have attended 263 seminars in 34 member countries. The seminars have been \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 8 March 2010. \n2 The first business opportunities fair was held at ADB headquarters on 18\u201319 November 2009. \n ", "2 \ndemand-driven. Although participants have consistently reported that they found the seminars to \nbe generally successful, the efficiency and effectiveness of this approach has been difficult to \nassess and baseline data have not been collected. The TA will redress this by establishing a \nmonitoring and evaluation framework with indicators measuring: (i) the quality of specific ADB \nBOOI-sponsored events, (ii) the quality of host organization support for ADB BOOI initiatives, \nand  (iii)  the  effect  on  participation  by  contractors  and  consultants  and  the  quality  of  the \npreparation of their bids and proposals. It is proposed that ADB will conduct pre- and post-event \nsurveys and annual electronic questionnaires to survey BOOI participants, host organizations, \nindustry associations, and professional groups. An expert in electronic time-based surveying will \nbe engaged to help develop an appropriate electronic platform, including survey tools that can \nbe used to monitor the BOOI effectively.  \n \n8.  The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The outcome will be high-quality competitive bids and proposals for the supply of goods \nand works, and consulting services from suppliers, contractors, and consulting firms in ADB \nmember  countries.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  greater  competition  among  suppliers, \ncontractors, and consulting firms for procurement under ADB-funded projects in its member \ncountries.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The outcome will be achieved through three outputs. The first will be that suppliers, \ncontractors, and consulting firms in ADB member countries will be advised on how to locate \nbusiness opportunities with ADB. ADB and its member countries will conduct 40 business \nopportunities seminars whose location will be demand-driven and determined in consultation \nwith members of ADB Board of Directors, among others. However, it is expected that a seminar \nwill not normally be held more than once a year in a member country.33The host organization \nwill provide the venue, promote the event, and invite participants. Seminars will be sequenced \nwhere practicable to ensure resources are used efficiently. Business opportunities fairs will \nnormally be hosted annually by ADB in its headquarters or in the region. They will provide a \none-stop forum and networking event for contractors, consultants, suppliers, and ADB staff.  \n \n11.  On  a  case-by-case  basis,  opportunities  will  be  taken  to  couple  BOOI  with  \"anchor \nevents\" in the contracting and/or consulting industry to maximize audience attendance and \nexposure to ADB. Anchor events will be either sector-based (e.g., energy, transport) or theme-\nbased (e.g., public\u2013private partnerships, environment) events such as conferences, conventions, \nforums,  fairs,  or  exhibitions.  ADB  Central  Operations  Services  Office  (COSO),  in  close \ncooperation with resident missions, the Regional and Sustainable Development Department, \ncommunities of practice, and regional departments, will identify and develop a list of preferred \nanchor events by region or country for which BOOI are targeted. \n \n \n                                                \n3 A list of countries will be developed during implementation. \n3 A list of countries will be developed during implementation. \n ", "3 \n12.  The second output will be an improved ADB business opportunities website that will \nprovide relevant information on business opportunities under ADB-financed projects to suppliers, \ncontractors,  and  consulting  firms.  This  will  be  achieved  by  upgrading  the  website  and \nimplementing a web-based BOOI monitoring tool. This will include recording feedback from \nparticipants  so  ADB  has  a  better  understanding  of  the  kind  of  information  requirements \ncontractors and consultants have and what they would like to have covered by BOOI events so \nADB service delivery quality can be further improved.  \n \n13.  The third output will be web-based BOOI training materials, and an efficient, web-based \nBOOI monitoring and evaluation tool. This will be implemented at ADB headquarters with the \nassistance of consultants. The target audience for the BOOI training materials will be staff \nworking at manufacturers, suppliers, exporters, trading houses, contractors and consultants, \nuniversities,  nongovernment  organizations,  embassies,  ministries  of  trade,  chambers  of \ncommerce, federations of industries, contractors and consultants associations, and government \nofficials involved in ADB-financed projects.  \n \n14.  Depending on the nature and intent of a specific BOOI, the training materials may cover \nall  or  a  selection  of  the  following  topics:  (i)  ADB's  mission,  organization,  and  operations;  \n(ii) ADB\u2019s project cycle, and the opportunities that exist at each stage of the cycle; (iii) the \nprovision of advance information about forthcoming business opportunities as contained on the \nADB website; in news releases, bid invitations in local newspapers, and on other websites; and \nin procurement notices in United Nations Development Business;44(iv) aspects associated with \nthe  recruitment  of  consultants,  including  registration,  expressions  of  interest,  short-listing \nprocedures, requests for proposals, preparation of competitive technical proposals, preparation \nof financial proposals, contract negotiations, and contract administration; (v) aspects associated \nwith the procurement of goods and works by the borrower, including prequalification, use of \nstandard bidding documents, procurement methods and procedures, preparation of responsive \nbids, public bid opening, bid evaluation, and application of domestic preference; (vi) ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and the investigative process and sanctions; \n(vii) redress procedures; (viii) procedures for the disbursement of funds to suppliers of goods, \nworks, and services; and (ix) contractors' and consultants' success stories under ADB-financed \ncontracts. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-IV). The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.   ADB is the executing agency for this TA. Disbursements under the TA will be done in \naccordance  with  the  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook.5  Individual \nconsultants will be recruited under the TA in accordance with the ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (1997, as amended from time to time).  \n \n                                                \n4  \n4 United Nations Development Business. http://www.devbusiness.com/ \n5 ADB. 2008.

The COSO business opportunities team will organize business opportunities seminars \nand a business opportunities fairs, coordinate and participate in anchor events, maintain the \nbusiness opportunities website, submit annual work plans related to business opportunities, and \ncollate annual statistics and data relevant to measuring BOOI performance. Consultants will \nassist the COSO business opportunities team with the (i) handling of logistical aspects of the \nBOOI, (ii) improvements to the ADB business opportunities website, (iii) development of related \nweb-based BOOI training materials, and (iv) development of an efficient, web-based BOOI \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  tool.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  these  consultants  is  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n18.  For  business  opportunities  seminars  and  anchor  events,  host  organizers  will  be \nresponsible  for  all  local  arrangements,  such  as  providing  conference  rooms,  audiovisual \nequipment, and secretarial assistance, and the issuing of advertisements and invitations to \ninterested participants. The host organizers may charge a nominal attendance fee to cover \nthese costs, including rental of conference rooms and lunch. Participants will be responsible for \ntheir own travel and accommodation costs. ADB will provide the resource speakers and seminar \ndocuments for participants. Members of the ADB Board of Directors normally help ADB to  \ncontact relevant organizations in the member countries represented by their constituencies.  \n \n19.  Business  opportunities  seminars  are  usually  requested  through  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors. In response to such requests, COSO communicates with the host organization and \ndesigns and plans the seminar in close cooperation with the organizers to suit their particular \nneeds and preferences. Seminars are conducted in English. The standard format recommended \nby COSO spans 2 days; on the first day, the seminar is held and on the second individual \ninterviews take place with the resource speakers. On the first day, there is usually a morning \nplenary  session,  after  which  the  participants  divide  into  two  groups:  an  industry  group \n(contractors, suppliers, and manufacturers) and a consultants group. Typical requests to amend \nthis  standard  format  to  suit  the  needs  of  a  particular  organization  include  (i)  conducting \ncondensed  presentations  in  consecutive  sessions  rather  than  concurrently;  (ii)  including \npresentations on ADB's private sector and/or cofinancing operations; (iii) emphasizing particular \nsectors,  countries,  and  topics  during  the  presentations;  and  (iv) having  abbreviated \npresentations but longer individual meetings or round table discussions. \n \n20.  For business opportunities fairs, ADB will provide the venue, resource speakers, and \npresentation materials. ADB staff will be available to conduct one-on-one meetings. The event \nwill be advertised on ADB's business opportunities website and details will be given on the \nprogram and logistics. The website will incorporate an online registration system. Feedback and \nrecommendations of participants attending the first business opportunities fair will be taken into \nconsideration in the planning of future events. Participants will be responsible for their own \ntravel and accommodation costs.  \n \n21.  The proposed use of anchor events as an additional BOOI tool will be carefully assessed \non a case-by-case basis, using agreed criteria to ensure the events are complementary and the \nlink with the anchor event adds value. Criteria for the identification of suitable anchor events \nmay include the following: (i) events are well publicized, (ii) the theme of the event is consistent \nwith business opportunities offered by ADB, (iii) the participant profile fits the target group for \nADB business opportunities, (iv) there are opportunities for meaningful interaction between ADB \nrepresentatives and interested participants, and (v) the organizers have experience of delivering \nwell-organized events. \n \n ", "5 \nIV.
