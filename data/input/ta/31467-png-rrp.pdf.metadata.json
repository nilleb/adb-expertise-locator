It will provide piped water supplies, sewerage and\nsewage  treatment  (new  or  upgrading  of  existing  systems  and\nexpanding  coverage)  to  six  selected  provincial  towns,  capacity\nbuilding for the PNG Waterboard, and support for selected sector\npolicy  measures.  In  addition,  a  low-cost  sanitation,  community\nawareness  and  health  education  (LCS-CAHE)  program  will  be\nimplemented  to  provide  (i)  affordable  options  (e.g.  ventilated\nimproved  pit  latrines)  for  on-site  sanitation  to  low-income\nhouseholds, and (ii) community awareness and health education.\nClassification Primary : Human development\nSecondary : Environment\nEnvironmental Category B\nAssessment An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken, and the\nsummary IEE is a core appendix.\nRationale The  prevailing  environmental  conditions  in  provincial  towns  have\nsignificant adverse impacts on people's health and quality of life and\nnegative  impacts  on  their  human  and  economic  development.\nImproving  basic  urban  services,  particularly  water  supply  and\nsanitation, is directly linked to the goal of improving public health and\noverall social indicators. Large sections of urban society suffer from\nservice  inadequacies  and  unsanitary  conditions,  with  the  poor\nsuffering  disproportionately  more.  Water  supply  and  sewerage\nsystems cover about 43 percent and 20 percent of the total urban\npopulation of PNG, respectively. Communities in the project towns\nacknowledge water as their number one priority, with lack of water\nduring the dry season as a very serious and universal problem.\nSanitation is generally inadequate. Where sewerage systems exist,\nthey  serve  mostly  the  developed  sections  of  towns.  For  many\ncommunities on the urban fringes, defecating in open air is the only\noption.\nObjectives and Scope The overall goal is to promote human and economic development in\nselected provincial towns by improving public health and quality of\nlife. The Project has two primary goals: (i) improvement of social\nindicators  for  the  overall  population,  particularly  in  the  poor\ncommunities  of  selected  provincial  towns;  and  (ii)  improved\ngovernance in the water supply and sanitation sector. The objectives\nof the proposed Project are to (i) increase coverage and improve\nquality  in  the  delivery  of  basic  water  supply  and  sanitation\n(sewerage) services; and (ii) improve management and coordination\nof the water supply and sanitation sector by building the capacity of\nthe Waterboard. The objective of the LCS-CAHE program (financed\nby  JFPR)  is  to  improve  health  and  reduce  poverty  for  poor\nhouseholds and other urban residents through low-cost sanitation\n(LCS),  community  awareness  and  health  education  (CAHE)\nactivities.\nThe Project scope consists of the following components:", "ii\n(i)  Provision  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  to  six  provincial\ntowns: (a) new or extension of safe water supply services in Kerema,\nMendi, and Wabag; and (b) rehabilitation of sewerage services and\nsewage treatment to improve environmental conditions in the towns\nof Alotau, Madang, and Mt. Hagen.\n(ii)  Sector  policy  support  and  capacity  building  for  the\nWaterboard:  (a)  support  policy  reform  to  establish  clearer  sector\nplanning  and  regulatory  responsibilities  as  well  as  funding\nprovisions; and (b) build the capacity of the Waterboard to improve\nmanagement capacities for higher efficiency, better operation and\nmaintenance, and adequate environmental management of its own\noperations.\n(iii)  Project management support: provision of consulting services\nto assist with project management activities including procurement,\ndetailed design, and construction supervision.\nIn addition, as a highly complementary part, a LCS-CAHE program\nwill  be  financed  by  the  JFPR  with  contributions  from  the  local\ngovernments  and  the  beneficiaries.  The  program  will  cover  five\nprovincial towns with two major components: (a) low-cost and on-site\nsanitation solutions to the problem of inadequate sanitation for the\nurban poor and other residents; and (b) awareness and education\nprograms to improve communities\u2019 knowledge on water, health, and\nsanitation issues.\nCost Estimates The Project is estimated to cost $23.3 million equivalent of which\n$13.2 million is the foreign currency cost and $10.1 million equivalent\nis the local currency cost.\nFinancing Plan The Project will have the following overall financing plan.\n($ million)\nSource   Foreign    Local Total          Percent\nExchange Currency  Cost\nADB        11.8       3.5              15.3    66\nCentral Govt             -                   6.1                6.1                  26\nAusAID          1.4       0.4                1.8      8\nTotal        13.2     10.1             23.3              100\nLoan Amount and The Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan will amount to Special\nTerms Drawing Rights 11,985,000 ($15,300,000 equivalent) from the Asian\nDevelopment Fund (ADF) with a term of 32 years, including an 8-\nyear grace period, with an interest charge of 1 percent per annum\nduring the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nJapan Fund for Poverty The low-cost sanitation, community awareness and health education\nReduction Grant (LCS-CAHE) program was approved by the Government of Japan\nfor financing in the amount of $1.74 million equivalent, under the\nJFPR.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 September 2005\nExecuting Agency PNG Waterboard\nImplementation The PNG Waterboard will establish a central project management\nArrangements unit that will be responsible for coordinating and managing all project\nactivities.

It will\nalso  strengthen  the  Waterboard\u2019s  management  capacities  and\noverall performance. In addition, the LCS-CAHE program will give all\nbeneficiaries, particularly the poorest, access to affordable on-site\nsanitation and improved health education.", "iv", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Provincial Towns Water\nSupply  and  Sanitation  Project,  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  assistance  for  low-cost\nsanitation, community awareness and health education.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In recognition of the adverse impacts of inadequate water supply and poor sanitation on\nhuman and economic development in provincial towns, in 1998 the Government requested\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) assistance in preparing the Provincial Towns Water Supply and\nSanitation Project. Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for this purpose was included\nin the 1999 Country Assistance Program and approved on 23 March 1999. The TA consultants\npresented the final report to ADB and the PNG Waterboard in May 2000. A Fact-Finding\nMission was fielded from 15 May to 4 June 2000. An Appraisal Mission followed on 18-29 July\n2000.1 The Mission held discussions with national and local government officials as well as with\nproject  stakeholders  including  representatives  of  the  private  sector,  non-government\norganizations (NGOs), and local communities to confirm the project objectives and components,\nand the willingness to actively participate in the project, especially in the low-cost sanitation\nprogram. This report is based on the findings of the ADB missions; reports prepared by the TA\nconsultants;  participatory  workshops;  and  discussions  with  Government  agencies,  NGOs,\ninternational  organizations,  bilateral  aid  agencies,  and  potential  project  beneficiaries.  The\nproject framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n \n1.  Poverty\n 3. After 25 years of political independence and some economic and social progress, a\nlarge number of the people of PNG remain poor. The Human Poverty Index for PNG is at the\nlevel of the Central African Republic and Mali, which are among the most poverty-afflicted\nnations in the world. Evidence from a 1996 household survey and 1996 prices indicate that 37\npercent of the population are below the poverty level of $350 (K461) per year.2 Poverty is high\ncompared with that in countries with similar income levels. Approximately 17 percent of the\npopulation cannot meet the basic requirement of 2,200 calories per day per adult equivalent,\neven if they spend all their income on food.\n \n 4. Poverty coexists with wealth. The richest 10 percent of the population account for 36\npercent of consumption, whereas the poorest 50 percent account for just 20 percent. The Gini\ncoefficient of 0.461 is high compared with that for countries of similar income levels. This\nreflects the dualistic pattern of growth during the postindependence period. Growth has been\nled by a capital-intensive minerals sector generating State revenues that were used in part to\nsupport a relatively large public service. The semisubsistence sector on which the vast majority\nof the population depends has shown little intensive growth. Per capita real gross domestic\n                                                \n1 The Mission comprised D. Ponzi, Economist (Environment) and Mission Leader; O. Tiwana, Counsel (20-25 July);\nM.

Poverty in PNG has an important regional dimension, with 93.3 percent of the poor living\nin rural areas. The incidence and extent of poverty vary significantly across the five major\nregions (Table 1). The Momase/North Coast region exhibits the highest incidence of poverty,\nwith 45.8 percent of the population living below the poverty line. Poverty rates in the regions of\nPapua/South Coast, Highlands, New Guinea Islands are clustered slightly below the national\naverage, ranging from 33.2 percent to 35.8 percent. The urbanized National Capital District\n(NCD) accounts for only 3.8 percent of the poor and only a quarter of its population fall below\nthe poverty line. The depth of poverty, measured by the poverty severity index3 is twice as high\nin the poorest Momase/North Coast region as in NCD.\nTable 1: Poverty Measures by Region\nRegion Head Count Index Poverty Severity % of Total\nPopulation\nIndex Contribution Index Contribution\nto total (%) to total (%)\nNational Capital District 25.8 3.8 3.3 3.3 5.5\nPapua/South Coast 33.2 13.2 5.5 14.7 14.9\nHighlands 35.8 38.3 5.3 38.0 40.1\nMomase/North Coast 45.8 35.5 6.6 34.2 29.2\nNew Guinea Islands 33.6 9.2 5.3 9.8 10.3\nPNG Total 37.5 100 5.6 100 100\nUrban 16.1 6.5 1.6 4.2 15.1\nRural 41.3 93.5 6.3 95.8 84.9\n Source: PNG Household Survey 1996.\n \n 6. The incidence of poverty is linked to the ability to earn cash income to pay for nonfood\nitems, to vary and improve diets, and to permit savings for times of economic difficulty (e.g.,\ndrought). Almost 17 percent of the poor population live in households whose heads earn no\ncash income, relying entirely on subsistence production (and perhaps gifts of cash). The poverty\nrate for these households is 47 percent. For almost 8 percent of the poor in households whose\nmain source of cash income is hunting, gathering, and fishing, the poverty rate is 57 percent.\nPoverty rates are also above the national average for households that earn cash income from\ntree crops (44 percent) and commercial agriculture (42.7 percent). These households account\nfor 42.5 percent and 19.0 percent of the poor population, respectively. Where household heads\nearn cash income from running a business or wage employment, poverty rates are much lower\n(25 percent and 17 percent, respectively). Although the latter households collectively account\nfor 29 percent of PNG's total population, they account for only 14 percent of the poor population.\nIn general, increased opportunities for earning secure cash incomes are needed to reduce the\nincidence and severity of poverty.\n \n7. Both  the  extent  of  income-earning  opportunities  and  the  ability  to  respond  to  such\nopportunities are determined significantly by access to the basic public services of transport,\nutilities,  health,  education,  and  financial  services.  The  population  as  a  whole  expressed\nconsiderable dissatisfaction with access to services in 1996, and it is highly likely that the\n                                                \n3 The poverty severity index is a distributionally sensitive poverty measure that takes into account the distribution of\nconsumption for those falling below the poverty line. The index shows that poverty is significantly deeper in rural\nthan in urban areas of PNG.", "3\ndegree of dissatisfaction increased during the late 1990s as a result of a widely acknowledged\ndeterioration in service provision. Poverty reduction requires improved service delivery to rural\nareas. This was the intention of provincial and local government reforms introduced under the\nOrganic  Law  of  1995,  but  capacity  and  funding  constraints  have  limited  the  effective\nimplementation of devolution.\n8. The fundamental and long-recognized development challenge for PNG is to achieve\nsustained  economic  growth  with  equity.  The  poorest  40  percent  of  the  population  must\nparticipate in and benefit from the growth process if poverty is to be reduced. There are severe\ndevelopment constraints, including the rugged terrain of PNG\u2019s 462,000 square kilometers,\ncomplexity of land tenure systems, dispersal of 4.5 million people collectively speaking well over\n800 languages, limited and deteriorating physical infrastructure, a major law and order problem,\nand low level of human resource development. Nonetheless, some key development constraints\ncan be eased over time through appropriate government action, notably in regard to investment\nin human capital, better service delivery including access to finance in the rural areas, and\ninfrastructure improvement. The Government is committed to address these issues to reduce\npoverty  and  socioeconomic  inequalities  through  private  sector-led  growth  and  employment\ncreation.\n2.  Water Supply and Sanitation Sector\n9. Papua New Guinea\u2019s population has a very high linguistic and cultural diversity. Total\npopulation in 1996 was estimated at 4.5 million, most of whom live in a subsistence lifestyle in\nthe rural areas without access to basic services such as potable water, adequate sanitation, and\nelectricity. A semi-subsistence sector provides livelihood for 85 percent of the population, which\nhas a current per capita gross domestic product of just under $900. Low life expectancy, high\ninfant mortality rate, poor adult literacy, and low enrollment ratio combine with low per capita\nincome  to  make  PNG\u2019s  human  development  level  the  lowest  in  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  developing\nmember countries (PDMCs). Health indicators show a high incidence of waterborne intestinal\ndiseases, particularly diarrhea and typhoid, which are directly attributable to unsafe drinking\nwater supplies and poor sanitation conditions.\n10. About 16 percent of PNG\u2019s urban population is categorized as poor.4 They are squatters\nin informal settlements, the unemployed and underemployed, and low-income groups burdened\nby  very  large  households.  The  urban  poor  are  most  vulnerable  because  they  have  fewer\nresources with which to change their circumstances. The time consumed in searching for water\ndiverts the poor from other productive tasks. Searching for alternative sources of water during\nthe dry season has a high negative impact on their already low productivity.\n11. PNG towns are typically small, consisting of 500 to 1,000 households, with the urban\npopulation  as  a  whole  not  growing  rapidly.  Port  Moresby  and  Lae  are  exceptions,  with\npopulations in excess of 100,000. Some urban centers have water supplies and only a few have\nadequate sanitation services. The small size of the towns and low urban population density\ncombined with the low average per capita income of the urban residents limit the scope for\nproviding and sustaining reticulated water supply and sanitation services on a cost recovery\nbasis.\n12. The Waterboard, Eda Ranu, Goroka Town Council, the Provincial Works Department in\nKiunga operate reticulated water supply systems. The Waterboard operates in 11 towns (Alotau,\nDaru, Kavieng, Kimbe, Kokopo, Kundiawa, Lae, Madang, Mt. Hagen, Wabag, and Wewak) with\n                                                \n4     The World Bank 1999 Papua New Guinea Poverty and Access to Public Services.", "4\nabout  20,800  connections.  Eda  Ranu,  a  private  company  operating  in  Port  Moresby,  has\napproximately the same number of connections as the Waterboard, and Goroka has about\n2,000. Small community or village water supply systems were provided in the past by aid\nagencies, government funding, and NGOs. In rural areas and urban fringes, most households\nstill obtain water from traditional sources such as rainwater catchment, dug wells, and rivers.\nWater supply coverage in PNG in 1996 was 43 percent of the total urban population and 29\npercent of the total rural population.\n13. Sanitation, a culturally sensitive issue in the country, is generally less developed than\nwater supply. The Waterboard operates sewerage systems in Alotau, Kimbe, Kundiawa, Lae,\nMt. Hagen, Popondetta, and Rabaul, collecting sewage through a reticulation system. Levels of\ntreatment vary, and operation and maintenance (O&M) problems are frequently encountered\nwith the treatment plants. Eda Ranu provides the only other reticulated sewerage system. The\ntown councils in Madang and Wewak operate a pan collection system, where household toilet\nwaste is collected twice weekly and discarded in waterways, some with basic treatment. Pan\nsystems pose significant health hazards and are not well regarded by the town councils and\nhousehold members. Urban households not connected to a sewerage system especially in\nsmall towns commonly use septic tanks and pit latrines, and waterways, and the surrounding\nbush continue to be used in many cases. Rural households defecate in open air. Sanitation\ncoverage in 1996 was estimated at 20 percent of the total urban population. There were no\nestimates of rural coverage.\n14. Although  the  National  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  (NWSS)  Act  established  the\nWaterboard in 1986 with broad powers to regulate all water supply and sanitation systems, the\nsector  remains  highly  fragmented.  The  Office  of  Conservation  and  Environment  (OCE)  is\nresponsible for administering the Environmental and Contaminants Act. The Department of\nPlanning  and  Monitoring  (DPM)  is  responsible  for  planning  development,  formulating  the\nnational budget, and sector policy issues including water and sanitation. The Department of\nWorks (DOW) has a Local Government Engineering Unit (LGE) that constructs small water\nsupply systems funded from the Rural Development Fund of members of Parliament. Prior to\nthe enactment of the Organic Law5 in 1996, the Department of Health (DOH) through its\nprovincial  offices  carried  out  programs  promoting  health  and  sanitation  in  the  rural  areas,\nincluding providing water supplies at the village level. Since 1996, the direct responsibilities of\nDOH have been devolved to the provincial governments (Figure 1, Supplementary Appendix B).\n15. The Waterboard is a commercial statutory authority with a board of directors directly\nappointed by professional bodies and the government agencies as stipulated in the NWSS Act.\nAs a result of this status, the Waterboard has to generate sufficient revenue to sustain its\nactivities.6 Its primary role is the development and O&M of urban water supplies and sanitation.\nUnder the terms of its enabling legislation,7 the Waterboard also has the broader mandate of (i)\npromoting  water  supplies  and  sanitation  in  rural  areas  and  urban  fringe  areas,  (ii)  setting\nstandards for materials and equipment, and carrying out adequate compliance functions and\nexercising control over other organizations providing water supply and sanitation services, and\n(iii) advising the Government on sector policy development and investment planning. However,\nas directed in the NWSS Act, these \u201cnonrevenue-generating\u201d activities are to be undertaken\nwith separate Government funding. Since the Waterboard receives no subsidy for this purpose,\nit has never been in a position to actually implement this broader role.\n                                                \n5    The Organic Law of Provincial Governments and Local Governments, 1996.\n6  The Waterboard is required to cover its operating costs from its revenues. However, no firm cost recovery targets\nhave been defined.\n7  The National Water Supply and Sewerage Act of 1986.", "5\n16. A number of constraints contribute to the low water supply and sanitation coverage in\nboth urban and rural areas in PNG. The underlying major sector issues can be put into the\nfollowing  categories:  (i)  sector  planning  and  coordination,  and  (ii)  service  delivery  and\nWaterboard performance.\n \na.  Sector Planning, Regulation, and Funding\n17. The absence of a central agency responsible for sector planning and coordination has\nled to ad hoc implementation of water supply and sanitation projects as Government agencies\nand  communities  react  to  offers  of  assistance  from  various  aid  agencies  and  NGOs.\nConsequently, there is no long-term national plan for developing the water supply and sanitation\nsector covering both the urban and rural areas. Shortage of financing is also a major constraint\nto sector development. A well-prepared national plan for developing water supply and sanitation\nthat includes financial requirements can be a powerful tool for advocating more fund allotments\nto  the  sector,  whether  from  the  central  Government  or  from  external  sources.  Similarly,\nprovincial sector plans prepared as components of the national plan can be used for a similar\npurpose with the provincial and local-level administrations (an initial analysis of the sector is in\nFigure 2, Supplementary Appendix B).\n18. There is a major gap in the organization of the sector, leaving rural water supply and\nsanitation highly underdeveloped. The NWSS Act gave the Waterboard the mandate to promote\nwater supply and sanitation in the rural areas, but did not provide it with funds to perform this\nrole. Hence, this function was not actively pursued but by default was delegated to DOH, which\nplanned  and  implemented  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects  through  its  provincial\noffices  as  part  of  its  health  promotion  program.  The  devolution  of  these  functions  to  the\nprovincial governments under the Organic Law resulted in virtually no development of the rural\nwater supply and sanitation sector. At present, the provincial and local governments lack the\nskills and management capability to ensure the sustainability of water supply and sanitation\nprojects.\n19. Further  development  of  the  sector  will  also  require  the  Waterboard  to  perform  its\nstandard setting, licensing, compliance, and regulatory functions. These responsibilities cover\nthe entire sector and are important to ensure that adequate water and sanitation services are\ndelivered by service providers. The issue of funding for these activities will have to be resolved\nfor the Waterboard to perform its mandated tasks. If the sector is reorganized in the future, the\nGovernment  should  consider  placing  the  regulatory  and  compliance  functions  under  an\nindependent regulatory body. This would allow the Waterboard to concentrate on providing\nwater supply and sanitation services to urban areas, including about 60 small secondary towns\nthat are still not served.\n \nb.  Service Delivery and Waterboard Performance\n20. The 11 water districts under the Waterboard supply water to about 59 percent of the\npopulation in 11 provincial towns. The water districts are relatively small with water connections\nranging from about 608 in Kundiawa to 6,560 in Lae. Currently, total production of treated water\nis  about  1,675,000  kiloliters  (kl)/month.  The  financial  and  operational  performance  of  the\nWaterboard has improved in recent years. Current average nonrevenue water for all 11 water\ndistricts is 25.1 percent, which is better than the average (40 percent) for the Asian and Pacific\nregion and this is an improvement from the 30-40 percent average level in the last four years.", "6\nStaff per 1,000 connections is 10.7, down from 14.7 in 1995 and better than the regional\naverage of 11.8. Sales per employee have increased from K29,000 in 1996 to K49,600 in 1999.\n21. In the last two years, the Waterboard has made an overall profit, mainly the result of\nnonoperational activities. Essential core activities, the supply of water and sewerage services,\ncan best be described as only marginally profitable and have relied on substantial cross-\nsubsidization between towns. Net assets of the Waterboard are currently valued at K66.6\nmillion. (The last major revision of these values was undertaken in 1988.) Current liabilities in\n1999 were K4.0 million and long-term liabilities were K13.3 million. Total shareholders funds\ncurrently stand at K66.6 million with the PNG Government as the lone shareholder. the ratio of\nnet profit to total assets has risen from negative 0.8 percent in 1996 to 5.9 percent in 1999. The\nreturn to owners\u2019 (Government) equity has risen from negative 0.7 percent to 5.7 percent in the\nsame period. To further improve its financial position, the Waterboard approved an increase in\ntariffs effective April 2000. Rates for higher volume blocks for all types of consumers were\nincreased. However, the new tariff structure also adopted a reduced charge lifeline rate for the\nfirst 12 kl, targeting low-income households. Similar reduced rates were also adopted for small\ncommercial and industrial consumers.\n22. Despite the improvements, delivery of water supply and sanitation services has been\naffected by deterioration in the facilities. Sewerage systems are presently discharging only\npartly treated effluent into receiving waters. Equipment needs repair, approaching complete\nobsolescence and breakdown. Water supply systems also suffer from problems of inadequate\nmaintenance. The Waterboard will have to improve O&M and environmental management of its\nwater supply and sanitation facilities particularly the sewerage systems (an initial analysis of the\nWaterboard management performance is in Figure 3, Supplementary Appendix B).\n23. In  addition  to  addressing  the  issue  of  O&M  and  environmental  management,  the\nWaterboard is trying to maintain and, to the extent possible, increase its customer base. Some\nof its smaller water districts are losing customers who disconnect from the water systems and\nconstruct and install their own systems. This problem is being addressed by adopting a more\ncustomer-oriented strategy and management policy, as well as enforcement of its compliance,\nregulatory, and monitoring functions.\n24. Similarly,  rural  water  supply  facilities  often  break  down  only  a  few  months  after\ninstallation  and  continue  to  be  in  a  state  of  disrepair  due  to  the  absence  of  repair  and\nmaintenance  programs  involving  the  beneficiary  communities  and  relevant  Government\nagencies. This was one of the lessons learned from the European Union-funded rural water\nsupply  programs.  The  ADB-funded  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Study8  in  1996\nrecommended a community-based approach that could lead to sustainable water supply and\nsanitation projects. The approach enhances participation through community awareness and\nhealth/hygiene  education.  Unfortunately,  subsequent  sector  projects  have  not  followed  the\nrecommendation.\n25. The low sanitation coverage for both urban and rural areas in PNG is a major sector\nissue that needs to be resolved. For lack of promotion there are not many sanitation programs\nespecially in the rural areas. Promoting sanitation and hygiene education is difficult due to\nlimited staff and financial resources of most rural local governments, the long distances to the\nvillages, and the highly varied conditions in PNG. In the urban areas, the high cost of reticulated\nsystems due to low population densities and rugged terrain makes it difficult to expand coverage\n                                                \n8 TA 2196-PNG: Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Study, for $380,000, approved on 2 November 1994.", "7\nfor these systems. Services also suffer from inadequate maintenance. On-site sanitation using\nlow-cost technologies may be the only viable and affordable solution for many urban areas,\nespecially for the low-income households in the urban fringe areas and settlements.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n26. The Medium-Term Development Strategy 1997-2002 (MTDS) of the Government is the\nmain strategic plan for the country\u2019s economic and social development. Its central objective is to\ncreate an environment that encourages people to use land, labor, and natural resources for their\nown welfare and the national benefit. To this end, the Government assigns a crucial role to the\nprovision  of  health  and  education  services,  maintenance  of  infrastructure,  creation  of\nopportunities  for  income  generation,  and  addressing  the  problems  of  law  and  order.\nAccordingly,  six  priority  sectors  receive  a  significant  proportion  of  the  total  central  budget\nappropriation and most of the external assistance: (i) agriculture and rural development, (ii)\nhealth, (iii) education, (iv) infrastructure, (v) law and order, and (vi) institutional strengthening\nand capacity building for good governance.\n27. The  health  sector,  in  particular,  is  a  major  focus  of  the  MTDS  and  was  recently\nrecognized as the main avenue, combined with education and agriculture, for achieving poverty\nreduction objectives. The Government recently reiterated its commitment to reduce poverty\nalong the lines of the ADB poverty reduction strategy.9 The Government recognizes that poverty\nis a major development issue that continues to undermine the government\u2019s efforts. In this\ncontext, the provision of basic services such as water supply and sanitation as part of a primary\nhealth care program is definitely a priority area for additional investments. Significantly, the new\ntariff structure recently implemented by the Waterboard is directed to the urban poor, with the\nadoption of a low and affordable lifeline rate of K3.50 for 12 kl water consumption per month\nand  abolition  of  the  connection  fees.  Another  development  with  good  potential  impact  on\npoverty is the Waterboard\u2019s commitment to include low-cost sanitation as an option for those in\nperi-urban areas of provincial towns.\n28. A major decentralization process was initiated with the passage of the Organic Law in\n1995 and the associated Provincial Governments Act and the Local-Level Governments Act\nwhich were both approved in 1997. The Organic Law provides for the devolution of powers,\nfunctions, and financial resources from the central to provincial, district, and local governments.\nIts thrust is to improve services delivery by relocating civil servants to provincial, district, and\nlocal  levels;  shifting  responsibilities  for  implementation  and  funding  to  local  governments;\nstrengthening  community  participation  in  government  decision  making;  and  fostering\ninvolvement of NGOs and community groups in service delivery. However, the objectives have\nnot been realized in the water supply and sanitation sector. Provincial and local governments do\nnot have the human and financial resources to plan and implement water supply and sanitation\nprograms and therefore will need assistance in developing their capacities.\n29. The MTDS further stresses that provincial and local Governments must be responsible\nfor basic services, and be innovative in identifying efficient and effective means for ensuring that\nthe grass roots have reasonable access to these services. In November 1999, the national\nGovernment and the provincial governments signed the National Charter on Reconstruction and\nDevelopment signifying their commitment to work together to improve basic services and create\nopportunities for income and employment activities as enunciated in the MTDS. They also\n                                                \n9  Statement made by the National Planning and Monitoring Minister representing the Prime Minister, endorsing\nADB\u2019s strategy against poverty during the 33rd Annual Board of Governors Meeting held in Chiang Mai in May\n2000.", "8\npledged  to  allocate  appropriate  resources,  including  funds  and  personnel,  to  the  priority\nprograms through national, provincial, district, and local budget appropriations.\n30. The  government  policy  machinery  was  recently  realigned  to  better  implement  the\ngovernment program for rapid divestment and privatization of government-operated businesses.\nThe  policy  objectives  and  strategies  of  the  Government  now  increasingly  focus  on  (i)\nencouraging  competition  and  fostering  efficiency  and  productivity  by  reforming  the  present\ninstitutional structure and supporting private sector development; (ii) stabilizing the economy\nthrough an integrated package of financial, monetary, and budget adjustment and stabilization\nmeasures;  and  (iii)  adopting  a  corporatization  and  privatization  program  to  divest  State\nownership,  management  and  control  of  public  enterprises  as  well  as  create  an  enabling\nenvironment for developing private sector initiatives. In this connection, the Government is\nconsidering privatizing the Waterboard.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n31. ADB support to the sector commenced with the TA10 and loan11 for the first Water Supply\nProject in 1975 and 1976, respectively. In total, three ADB-funded urban water supply projects\nhave  progressively  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  in  five  provincial  towns\n(Kokopo, Lae, Madang, Mt. Hagen, and Wewak). The most recent of them, the Third Urban\nWater Supply Project,12 is scheduled for completion in October 2001. Three TA projects since\n199413  have  aimed  at  strengthening  the  Waterboard  and  reviewing  the  water  supply  and\nsanitation sector. ADB also assisted the development of rural water supply as a component of\nits Third Rural Health Project loan.14\n32. Other bilateral and multilateral agencies active in the water supply and sanitation sector\ninclude  the  European  Union,  World  Bank,  the  governments  of  Australia,  Japan,  and  New\nZealand. All have been particularly active in rural water supply. The European Union has funded\na number of rural water supply projects. The World Health Organization and Australian Agency\nfor  International  Development  (AusAID)  are  providing  technical  expertise  for  planning  and\ndesigning  rural  water  supplies.  Similarly,  the  World  Bank  has  supported  mainly  the  rural\nsubsector. However, while ADB remains the main aid agency in the field of urban water supply,\nsignificant and recently increasing funding for urban projects has also come from AusAID and\nJapan International Cooperating Agency. A table showing external assistance to the sector is in\nAppendix 2.\n \n D. Lessons Learned\n33. ADB is the leading funding agency in the water supply and sanitation sector with various\ninvestment and TA projects implemented in the last 15 years. As a result, some important\nlessons have been learned with respect to both sustainable sector development in general, and\ntimely project implementation in particular. Lessons relating to sectorwide development point to\nthe following constraints: (i) inadequate sector coordination, funding, and medium- and long-\nterm planning; (ii) inadequate capacities of main sector agencies, especially the Waterboard; (iii)\n                                                \n10TA 0179-PNG: Water Supply Project, for $185,000, approved on 11 November 1975.\n11Loan 0278-PNG: Water Supply Project, for $13.5 million, approved on 11 November 1976.\n 12Loan 1211-PNG: Third Urban Water Supply Project, for $11.3 million, approved on 15 December 1992.\n 13TA 1803-PNG: Institutional Strengthening Project, for $400,000, approved on 15 December 1992, TA 2196-PNG,\nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector Study, for $250,000, approved on 2 November 1994; and TA 3173 - PNG:\nProvincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation, for $500,000, approved on 23 March 1999.\n 14 Loan 1097\u2013PNG: Third Rural Health Project, for $22.3 million, approved on 5 September 1991, of which $1.1\nmillion was for water supply and sanitation.", "9\ninsufficient funding for O&M of water supply and sanitation systems; (iv) insufficient attention to\nlow-cost options for both water supply and sanitation for the poor; (v) ineffective implementation\nof the overall sector regulatory functions of the Waterboard; and (vi) limited implementation of\ncommunity-based programs, and awareness and health education activities.\n34. Most water supply and sewerage systems have suffered from O&M deficiencies, lack of\nplanned upgrading, and failure to replace obsolete equipment. Provisions for addressing O&M\ncapacities and overall asset management have to be effectively built into any new project.\nAnother major issue often causing project implementation delays and cost overruns relates to\nland  ownership,  land-lease  disputes,  and  compensation.  Based  on  ADB  and  Waterboard\nexperience, land acquired and leased - particularly from customary landowners - may become a\ncompensation issue with each new generation every 15 to 20 years. One solution is to minimize\ncustomary land involvement whenever possible. Where this is not possible, land can be used\nthrough joint ventures or other convenient arrangements with the traditional landowners.\n35. In recent years and as a result of the Organic Law and the new role of the provincial\nadministrations,  some  project  implementation  problems  have  arisen  because  of  lack  of\ncoordination  among  the  central  agencies  and  between  the  Waterboard  and  the  provincial\nadministrations. Underdevelopment of water supply and sanitation for rural and urban fringe\nareas will continue unless a Government agency actively promotes sector development for\nthose areas. DOH is no longer involved in promoting rural water supply and sanitation after\nresponsibility for that was devolved to provincial administrations. In many developing countries,\nlow-cost technologies for both water supply and sanitation have been successfully introduced to\nmake services affordable to poor households in both rural and urban areas. In light of this\nexperience, the Project will include a low-cost sanitation component. Finally, another major\nneed  is  to  design  projects  with  the  active  participation  of  beneficiaries  and  local-level\ngovernment institutions at all phases of project planning, implementation, and O&M.\n \n E. ADB's Sector Strategy\n36. ADB\u2019s  policy  on  water  supply  and  sanitation15  is  centered  on  the  following  main\nobjectives: (i) strengthening the policy and regulatory functions of the main planning/regulatory\nbody for the sector; (ii) fostering overall institutional framework and institutional arrangements\nfor efficient management of the sector; (iii) increasing community participation and management\nof water supply and sanitation at the lowest practicable level to ensure interaction with the\nbeneficiaries; (iv) targeting the poor and addressing their needs through appropriate specific\nlow-cost schemes, tariff adjustments (lifeline block tariffs), low or zero connection fees, and\nother  appropriate  solutions;  (v)  promoting  private  sector  participation,  public-private\npartnerships,  and  contracting-out  arrangements;  (vi)  improving  water  utilities  management\nperformance; and (vii) increasing investments in the sanitation subsector as a percentage of the\ntotal water supply and sanitation sector investments.\n37. The ADB country operational strategy (COS) for PNG is generally consistent with the\noverall  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  policy  outlined  in  para.  36  and  with  the  ADB\noverarching goal of poverty reduction. In particular, the COS has a major focus on the goal of\nimproved  social  indicators  (together  with  improved  governance  and  private  sector\ndevelopment), which is among the main goals of the proposed Project. This goal is to be\nachieved mainly by pursuing the objectives of ADB\u2019s sector policy, which aims at increasing\noverall coverage of adequate water supply and sanitation in an equitable way. This is to be\n                                                \n15 Final draft under review.", "10\nattained by ensuring that existing and future services are affordable, particularly to the poor, and\nfinancially viable and economically sustainable in the medium to long term. Other cross-cutting\nissues such as gender, community awareness and education on health and hygiene, and\nenvironmental protection also remain central concerns of the sector strategy and positively help\nin achieving improved social indicators for the country. The Project is in line with these sector\nstrategy objectives, is consistent with the COS for PNG, and meets ADB's poverty reduction\nstrategy in relation to social sector and urban development.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n38. Policy dialogue with the Government started with the first Water Supply Project (footnote\n11), which was approved in 1976. The ADB study identified a number of priority areas for\nlegislation and policy reform including strategic development planning, policy development, and\ncoordination. These are sectorwide functions that have been largely ignored by major sector\ninstitutions such as the Waterboard and currently remain crucial issues of the policy agenda.\nHence, while progress in certain areas is encouraging, various key policy issues remain to be\naddressed and constitute the focus of the current policy dialogue.\n39. In recent years, strengthening the Waterboard has been the focus of various TAs.16\nInstitutional strengthening is the area where policy dialogue efforts have been most successful,\nwith significant improvements achieved in the last few years. They relate notably to (i) staff\nretrenchment  and  increase  of  overall  personnel  productivity,  (ii)  tariff  increases  and  tariff\nstructure adjustment, (iii) management information system, (iv) financial management, and (v)\ncorporate strategic planning. An initial analysis of the Waterboard management performance is\nin Figure 3, Supplementary Appendix B.\n \n  1. Sector Policy Support and Capacity Building for the Waterboard\n40. Institutional and policy reform are needed to address policy issues relating to sector\nplanning and coordination, such as (i) overall rationalization and coordination of the sector and\nleadership role of the Waterboard; (ii) sector planning responsibilities and the advisory role of\nthe Waterboard; (iii) promoting water supply and sanitation in rural areas; (iv) improving the\ndecentralization process and developing partnerships with provincial and local governments; (v)\nfunding  the  Waterboard  nonrevenue-generating  activities  (compliance,  licensing/monitoring,\nother planning and regulatory functions, rural water supply and sanitation, etc.); and (vi) future\nof the Waterboard vis-\u00e0-vis recent government privatization policies.\n41. The issues have to be resolved to allow the Waterboard to fulfill its mandate under the\nNWSS Act. As a national organization with a sector focus and with central and provincial\npresence, the Waterboard is well placed and has authority under the Act to bring coordination\nand  cohesive  planning  to  the  sector.  Under  the  Project,  and  in  particular  the  Waterboard\nCapacity Building Action Plan (Table 1, Supplementary Appendix B), the Waterboard will submit\nto the National Executive Council (NEC) a policy reform statement on a program to strengthen\nthe water and sanitation sector. The submission will seek NEC approval to have the NWSS Act\namended so that the sector can become self-funding by being allowed to use part of the\nWaterboard\u2019s previous years' revenue to promote rural water supply and sanitation and to\neffectively fulfill its planning and regulatory functions. The policy reform statement will also seek\nNEC approval for the Waterboard to become the main sector-planning agency to assist the\nDepartment of Planning and Monitoring by preparing a comprehensive sector development\n                                                \n16 TA 1803-PNG (footnote 13) which was associated with the Third Urban Water Supply Project; and TA 3173-PNG\n(footnote 13) (advisory elements)", "11\nplan. Approval will allow the Waterboard to take the lead in sector planning and coordination,\nincluding the preparation of a long-term national plan for developing the water supply and\nsanitation sector.  It can then take the necessary steps to actively promote rural water supply\nand  sanitation  and  perform  its  other  noncommercial  functions  with  the  use  of  part  of  its\nrevenues.\n42. Under the project preparation TA, the Waterboard started developing partnerships with\nprovincial and local governments through dialogue and workshops on the Waterboard\u2019s new\ncorporate strategy in delivering water and sanitation services in urban areas. This will be\ncontinued during project implementation in eight provincial towns.\n43. The Government recently proposed the privatization of various state owned enterprises\n(SOEs). The Waterboard is included tentatively on the list of SOEs to be privatized; however, it\nis definitely not a high priority. The Government needs to maintain a continuing dialogue and\nconsultation with ADB on the status of any plan to privatize the Waterboard. The prevailing\neconomic, social, and market conditions in the water supply and sanitation sector in PNG may\nnot be suitable for full privatization and complete divestiture of the Waterboard. Its overall size\n(20,800 total connections) and the size of its water districts (608-6,560 connections) are very\nsmall.    This  characteristic  combined  with  rugged  topography,  low  urban  density,  and  low\naverage household income, creates an environment not likely to attract private investors.\n44. In  addition,  at  the  current  development  stage,  the  sector  still  needs  financing  on\nconcessional terms and overall public support despite recent progress in overall efficient service\ndelivery and cost recovery. ADB\u2019s general support to the sector and capacity building for the\nWaterboard  should  therefore  continue,  especially  toward  increased  efficiency  and  financial\nautonomy. This could include some form of private sector involvement through contracts for\nspecific  services  or  management.  Besides,  the  Waterboard  has  sector  management\nresponsibilities including regulatory, licensing, and compliance functions that should remain\nunder Government control, notwithstanding any possible privatization of the office.\n45. The Waterboard as a water utility needs to improve the performance of its water districts\nin supplying water and sanitation services to the urban population. Under the Project, the policy\ndialogue on capacity building for the Waterboard relates to the following issues: (i) introducing\nan  integrated  management  information  system  (MIS);  (ii)  strengthening  compliance\nenforcement, standard setting, licensing, and other regulatory capacities; (iii) implementing a\nmore client-oriented strategy and management policy; (iv) improving financial management; (v)\nstrengthening the environmental management and monitoring capacities; (vi) improving O&M\nperformance; and (vii) building the capacity to provide technical support for and promote low-\ncost sanitation programs. Accordingly, through the Project, the Waterboard will address various\nissues:  establishing  an  integrated  MIS;  developing  capacities  for  O&M;  environmental\nmanagement and monitoring; and setting up a compliance and monitoring unit. This capacity-\nbuilding program is well coupled with the recently developed Waterboard Corporate Plan and\nStrategic Plan oriented to further improvement of its internal operations and customer focus,\nincluding creating institutional awareness among consumers and local governments of the\nWaterboard\u2019s new strategies and service development policies.\n \n  2. Low-Cost Sanitation\n46. The high capital costs of conventional reticulated sewerage systems have proved to be\nunsustainable,  particularly  for  low-income  households  in  the  urban  settlements.  Current\nsanitation practices such as unsafe disposal at the household and local authority level present", "12\nmajor health risks in many towns. Alternative affordable low-cost and easily maintained forms of\nsanitation must be used to improve living conditions for these households. The Waterboard\nrecently  developed  a  pro-low-cost  sanitation  (LCS)  position,  according  to  which,  the\nimplementation of both water and sanitation projects needs to be a progressive process, the first\nstep being low-cost and affordable solutions. To address these concerns, under the LCS part of\nthe proposed Project, the Waterboard will pilot-test in selected provincial towns a community-\nbased  approach  in  providing  on-site,  low-cost  technology  solutions  to  sanitation  where\nreticulated sewerage is unaffordable to urban residents. The program will involve participatory\napproaches with the communities/beneficiaries, NGOs, and the local governments.\n47. Drawing  from  past  sector  experience,  particularly  that  of  the  European  Union,  the\nproposed Project will complement the use of appropriate on-site sanitation technology with\ncommunity  awareness  and  hygiene  education  to  improve  sustainability  by  strengthening\ncommitment and participation of the partners in the Project. The use of a community-based\napproach  was  also  recommended  in  the  ADB  study.  The  active  participation  of\ncommunities/beneficiaries in planning and implementing this component will reduce the cost of\nsanitation facilities at the community level, provide a sense of community ownership, and help\nmaintain improved community sanitation conditions.\n \n  3. Tariff Reform, Cost Recovery and Affordability\n48. Following a review under the TA, the Waterboard took steps to address the objectives of\n(i) improved financial performance and sustainability, and (ii) poverty reduction and affordability.\nAs a result of the work undertaken during project preparation and during the policy dialogue\nbetween the Waterboard and ADB, new tariffs applicable to all districts became effective in April\n2000. The new tariff structure includes a lifeline tariff for the first 12 kl for both domestic and\nnondomestic users, and abolishes connection charges. These measures address the needs of\nlow-income groups - households and small commercial and industrial users - by making water\nservices affordable to them. To improve financial performance, rates for higher volume blocks\nwere  increased  (average  tariff  increases  of  about  20  percent)  to  improve  revenue  and\nencourage rationale use and water conservation through demand management.\n49. While the April 2000 tariffs uniformly apply across all the Waterboard towns, the board of\nthe Waterboard in principle accepted the need for differential tariffs across towns and is working\ntoward the goal of financial viabilty for each district cost center and gradual elimination of cross-\ntown subsidies. In pursuit of this financial objective and to improve the overall financial position\nof the Waterboard, the board recommended that any investment undertaken as part of the\nProject should be financially viable for each individual subproject. This requires tariffs to cover\nO&M including administration costs at the district level, full depreciation on assets, interest\npayable, and incremental head office costs. While a subsidy may be acceptable in the short\nterm, the board requires each subproject to break even in the medium term and provide in the\nlonger term a return on investment of around 5 percent, in accordance with the recently adopted\nWaterboard corporate plan.\n50. The application of full cost recovery tariffs needs to be carefully structured to ensure that\npoverty reduction and affordability objectives are not compromised. Required increases in tariffs\nshould take place gradually, and their effects monitored, particularly in small districts, to balance\nthe need for financial viability on one side and affordability on the other. Tariffs also need to be\nstructured in such a way as to encourage demand management, and also participation and\ncustomers\u2019 loyalty to ensure adequate revenues. To this end tariff adjustments will need to be\nbacked by strong compliance, licensing, and regulatory procedures to ensure that higher tariffs", "13\ndo  not  lead  to  disconnections  and  an  overall  loss  in  Waterboard  revenue.  Compliance,\nlicensing,  regulation,  and  enforcement  are  critical  to  the  financial  performance  of  the\nWaterboard at the subproject and at the general institutional level. These needs are addressed\nas a key part of the Waterboard capacity building component that will help the Waterboard\nachieve its financial objectives.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n51. Prevailing environmental conditions in provincial towns have significant adverse impacts\non people's health and quality of life, with negative impacts on their human and economic\ndevelopment.  Improving  basic  urban  services,  particularly  water  supply  and  sanitation,  is\ndirectly linked to the goal of improving public health and overall social indicators. Currently,\nlarge sections of urban society suffer from service inadequacies and unsanitary conditions, with\nthe poor suffering disproportionately more. Urban water supply and sewerage coverage is about\n43 percent and 20 percent, respectively. 17 Communities in these towns consider water as their\nnumber one priority, with lack of water during the dry season being a very serious and universal\nproblem. Households often resort to polluted supplies, thus exposing themselves to risks of\nwaterborne intestinal diseases. The incidence of diarrhea and typhoid, among others, is high.\nSanitation is generally inadequate, and where sewerage systems exist, they mostly serve the\ndeveloped sections of towns. For many communities on the urban fringes and most of the\npoorer settlements, defecating in open air is the only option. The fact that many sewerage\nschemes carry out only partial treatment of wastewater and often are malfunctioning adds to the\noverall environmental degradation process. At the same time, residents have little appreciation\nof good sanitation and hygiene practices and their linkage to health conditions. In many towns,\ntherefore, inadequate sanitation is a source of major health hazards: human waste continues to\npollute water sources used for all purposes while raw or poorly treated sewage flows into\nwatercourses, tidal beaches, and onto coastal and harbor foreshores.\n52. The contribution of women to the PNG household welfare is affected by high levels of\ndiarrhea, which has impacts on their role in the family and the local economy, particularly the\ninformal sector - subsistence gardening and selling of produce. Due to intestinal illnesses,\nchildren repeatedly miss out on education opportunities, and those who continue to attend\nschool while sick exhibit reduced attention and low knowledge retention levels. Improvements to\nwater supply and sanitation will reduce household outlays on medicines and hospital visits.\nHealth improvements resulting from better sanitation and greater availability of clean water are\nparticularly important to the poor who frequently do not have cash for health services and\nmedicines.  The need for intervention in the project target towns is very strong.\n53. Past external support to the sector has significantly improved the level of water supply\nand sanitation (mainly sewerage) services in towns around the country and strengthened the\nmanagement capabilities of the Waterboard. However, the situation in the sector remains critical\nin a number of crucial areas and there is a strong need to (i) increase overall coverage in an\nequitable, participatory, and sustainable way in various provincial towns for both water supply\nand sanitation as current coverage remains relatively low; (ii) extend low-cost and sustainable\nsolutions to the urban fringes and informal settlements where most of the poor reside (small\nurban populations in most provincial centers combined with their average low income translate,\nin most cases, into low levels of affordability of conventional reticulated sewerage schemes);\n                                                \n17As percentage of total urban formal population Source: TA 219 \u2013PNG: Water Supply & Sanitation Sector Study,\nfinal report, March 1996 (the ADB study).", "14\nand (iii) further improve management capacities and operational efficiency of the Waterboard as\nwell as promote improved sector planning, policy development, and institutional coordination.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n54. While the overall goal is to promote human and economic development in selected\nprovincial towns by improving public health and quality of life, the Project has two primary goals:\n(i) improved social indicators for the overall population, particularly the poor communities of\nselected provincial towns including improved health and poverty reduction through the provision\nof affordable water supply, sewerage, and sanitation services; and (ii) improved governance in\nthe water supply and sanitation sector. The Project objectives are as follows:\n(i)  increased coverage and improved delivery of basic water and sanitation services\nby developing affordable and sustainable water supply, sewerage, and sanitation\nschemes in selected priority towns;\n(ii)  improved  management  and  coordination  of  the  water  supply  and  sanitation\nsector  through  sector  policy  reform,  institutional  strengthening,  and  capacity\nbuilding for the Waterboard;\n55. The project consists of the following three components:\n(i) provision of water supply and sewerage to selected provincial towns. These\nsubprojects will provide for: (a) new or expanded safe water supply services in\nthe provincial towns of Kerema, Mendi, and Wabag; and (b) new or rehabilitated\nsewerage services in the provincial towns of Alotau, Madang, and Mt. Hagen.\nDetailed technical design of subprojects and construction supervision will also be\nprovided through specific consulting services packages. A summary description\nof the water supply and sanitation subprojects is in Appendix 3.\n(ii) Sector  policy  support  and  capacity  building  for  the  Waterboard. The  first\nsubcomponent is policy reform support to establish clear sector planning and\nregulatory responsibilities and initiate other required policy changes relating to\nthe planning and advisory role of the Waterboard, promotion and funding of water\nsupply and sanitation in rural areas, funding of the Waterboard\u2019s nonrevenue-\ngenerating  activities  (regulatory  functions),  overall  rationalization  and\ncoordination  of  the  sector,  and  the  potential  overall  leadership  role  of  the\nWaterboard in the context of the organic law for decentralization (Appendix 2). A\npolicy/institutional specialist will provide consulting services for this component.\nThe second subcomponent is capacity building. Consulting services will help\nimprove the Waterboard's overall performance by (a) strengthening to improve its\nmanagement capacities and increase efficiency; (b) building its capacity for O&M\nthrough appropriate training, systems establishment, and awareness programs;\nand (c) strengthening its capacity to effectively assess and mitigate negative\nenvironmental impacts resulting from its operations. A summary description of\nthis component is in Supplementary Appendix A.\n(iii) Project management support. An engineering consulting services package will\ntrain the project management unit to carry out all project management activities\nincluding procurement, detailed design, and construction supervision.", "15\nC.  Technical Justification\n56. To select the subproject towns, prefeasibility studies and engineering designs were\nmade during project preparation for water supply and sanitation for 12 provincial towns currently\nwithout adequate facilities. Where technical options were available, an economic least-cost\nanalysis was undertaken. The selected options were then subjected to financial and economic\nanalyses, with the economic international rate of return (EIRR) decision cutoff rate of 10 percent\nas  the  main  criterion  to  select  the  subprojects.  As  a  result  the  following  schemes  were\nrecommended: (i) water supply subprojects for Kerema, Mendi, and Wabag; and (ii) sewerage\nsubprojects for Alotau, Madang, and Mt. Hagen. In addition a LCS program for the urban fringe\nareas of Alotau, Lae, Madang, Mt. Hagen, and Wewak was recommended to target poor\nhouseholds that could not be covered by sewerage systems.\n57. Project identification and preliminary designs for the water supply reticulated schemes\nwere based on predicted demand as determined by projections of population levels for the year\n2020  and  per  capita  water  consumption.  In  towns  where  no  potable  water  supply  exists,\nalternative water sources were identified and options for their use considered in detail. Preferred\noptions  were  chosen  on  the  basis  of  availability,  cost,  quality  of  the  water  source,  and\nconsequent ease of treatment. In towns where a potable water supply exists, augmenting the\nexisting system, using the same source and treatment methods, was found feasible, allowing for\nsimpler installation and O&M of the new or improved plant.\n58. The scope for installing reticulated systems and a sewage treatment plant and the\ndemand for a sewerage system were assessed before identifying and designing the sanitation\nsystems. The technical feasibility for a reticulated system was constrained in some towns by\nvery  low  housing  density  that  requires  a  very  high  investment  per  household  in  pumping\nfacilities. This situation is exacerbated in several cases by low gradients and high water tables.\nThe simplicity of O&M of the treatment systems was also considered. There is scope for low-\ncost alternatives, particularly in areas of low-density housing. The LCS program covers options\nfor managing human waste and substantially reducing exposure to the pathogens it contains,\nbased on a single household on site. The need to improve the living conditions of poor urban\ndwellers is further addressed through the CAHE program.\n59. Limited  land  availability  affected  the  scope  for  both  water  supply  and  sanitation\nsubprojects.  All  proposed  systems  were  designed  to  be  sited  within  the  present  town\nboundaries on public-owned land or roads because nearly all remaining candidate sites for\ntreatment plants and other facilities were on customary land, which is rarely made available for\npublic use in PNG on an indisputable, long-term basis. In the unlikely event that land issues\ncause  problems,  a  20  percent  physical  contingency  for  the  water  supply  and  sewerage\nsubprojects was included in the cost estimates to ensure that insufficient funding does not\nbecome a constraint in resolving such issues.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n60. The total cost of the Project, including allowance for physical and price contingencies,\nand duties and taxes, is estimated at $23.3 million equivalent. The foreign currency cost is\n$13.2 million equivalent, or 57 percent of the total cost. The local currency cost is $10.1 million\nequivalent, or 43 percent of the total cost. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 2.\nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix C.", "16\nTable 2: Cost Estimates\n($ millions)\nComponent Foreign Local Total Cost Percent\nExchange Currency\nWater Supply\n   Kerema 1.0 1.1 2.1 9\n   Mendi 3.7 3.2 6.9 29\n   Wabag 1.5 1.3 2.8 12\nSub-Total 6.2 5.6 11.8 51\nSewerage\n   Alotau 0.2 0.1 0.3 1\n   Mt.

Because of the preliminary\nnature of the engineering designs, lack of detailed topographical maps, and the need to ensure sufficient funding to assist in\nresolving any potential land issues, a physical contingency of 20% has been applied to base costs.\ncThe international escalation factor used is 2.4% and the domestic is 5%.\nE.  Financing Plan\n61. Under ADB\u2019s Graduation Policy, the normal cost-sharing limit for PNG during 2000 is 50\npercent. However, the policy allows ADB financing for a project to exceed the cost-sharing limit\nunder exceptional circumstances, when justified by country and project considerations. The\nGovernment has recently faced severe financial constraints due to the economic crisis and the\nattendant  scarcity  of  domestic  counterpart  funds.  As  a  consequence,  in  August  1999,  the\nGovernment initiated a macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms program with wide\nexternal support: the International Monetary fund (IMF) approved a $115 million line of standby\ncredit in March 2000, and the World Bank approved a $90 million Governance Promotion\nAdjustment Loan in June 2000. Technical assistance and budgetary support from Australia, and\ngeneral balance of payments support from Japan are also providing additional assistance to the\nGovernment's program. These measures have brought about improvements in the country's\nfiscal and balance of payments positions with inflation and interest rates also declining since the\nbeginning of the program. Nevertheless, the very tight fiscal situation is expected to continue\nover the next few years. Accordingly, the Government has requested ADB to consider a general\nchange in its treatment of PNG and, in the interim, consider an increase in the cost-sharing\npercentage for this project. Therefore, it is proposed that ADB\u2019s share of the project cost be\nincreased from 50 percent to 66 percent of the total project cost.\n62. It is proposed that ADB finance $15.3 million equivalent (66 percent) of the total project\ncost ($23.3 million). About $6.1 million equivalent (26 percent) will be financed by the central\nGovernment. Detailed financing plans for the ADB-funded components are in Appendix 5 and\nSupplementary Appendix C.\n63. AusAID has agreed, in principle, to provide parallel grant co-financing in the amount of\n$1.8 million equivalent (8 percent) for the capacity building component of the Project, subject to\ncompleting its own appraisal and obtaining required internal approvals.", "17\n64. The ADB loan will be from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund (ADF) with a term of 32\nyears, a grace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1 percent per annum during the grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent thereafter. The Borrower will be Papua New Guinea. In consideration of\n(i) the social nature of the project, which will bring significant benefits in terms of public health,\nbetter environmental conditions and improved access to basic services for all town residents\nincluding the poor; and (ii) the need to further support the financial position of the Waterboard,\n(paras. 44 and 45), it is proposed that the Government bear the foreign exchange rate risk and\nrelend  to  the  Waterboard  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  through  a  subsidiary  loan\nagreement  in  form  and  substance  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Waterboard,  as  the  Executing\nAgency, will enter into a project agreement with ADB.\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Cost Percent\nExchange Currency\nADB 11.8 3.5 15.3 66\nCentral Government 6.1 6.1 26\nAusAID 1.4 0.4 1.8 8\nTOTAL 13.2 10.1 23.3 100\nADB =Asian Development Bank, AusAID =Australian Agency for International Development.\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Overall Project Implementation and Coordination Arrangements\n65. The Project will be implemented over four years starting from 2001 (Appendix 6). The\nWaterboard has established a project management unit (PMU) with qualified staff acceptable to\nADB. Staff will also be seconded from the Waterboard provincial offices to the PMU to develop\ntheir capacity for supporting the construction and operation of the project facilities. For water\nsupply and sewerage construction implementation, project towns implementation units (PTIUs)\nwill  be  established  in  the  provincial  town  offices  of  the  Waterboard  for  day-to-day  project\nmanagement  and  supervision.  Detailed  project  implementation  arrangements  are  in\nSupplementary Appendix D.\n66. A project steering committee (PSC) at the central level is envisaged to ensure adequate\nsupport  from  and  liaison  with  other  Government  agencies.  The  PSC  will  comprise  the\nWaterboard\u2019s managing director and officials from various government departments, including\nDPM as chair, DOH, DOW, Department of Finance, and Department of Provincial and Local\nGovernment Affairs. The PSC will also have representatives of the private sector and NGOs\nnationally  recognized  for  their  involvement  in  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  and\ncommunity  development  work.  The  Waterboard  will  provide  the  PSC  secretariat.  The\ncommittee's responsibilities will include overall supervision of the Project and approval of the\nreports  and  financial  statements  to  be  submitted  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  PSC\nmembership  and  preliminary  terms  of  reference  (TORs)  are  outlined  in  Supplementary\nAppendix F.\n67. To  complete  the  coordination  arrangements  and  to  facilitate  consultation  and\nparticipatory processes with the provincial, town, and local authorities and the community,\nprovincial towns coordination committees (PTCC) will be established for the water supply and\nsewerage subprojects. The PTCC will comprise the provincial administrator as the chair, the", "18\ntown manager, a representative of women's interests, representatives of the NGOs active in the\ndistrict,  the  Waterboard  district  manager,  and  community  representatives  chosen  for  their\nstanding in the community and their ability to bring community participation inputs to the project.\nThe PTCC will meet regularly, make its operations public, advise on and facilitate public debate\nand involvement in matters of community interest in water supply and sanitation. Membership\nand  preliminary  TORs  for  the  PTCC  are  outlined  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The\nWaterboard\u2019s provincial offices will provide the PTCC secretariats.\n2. Procurement\n68. All  ADB-financed  procurement  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\nProcurement. All civil works contracts for water supply, sewerage, and other major civil works in\nexcess of $1,000,000 will be awarded under international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures.\nInternational shopping (IS) may be employed where the estimated cost is less than $1,000,000.\nAll contracts for procurement of goods exceeding $500,000 in value will be procured under ICB,\nand IS may be employed where the estimated amount is less than $500,000.\n69. At the Government\u2019s request, and given the lack of interest of foreign contractors and\nsuppliers, all civil works and materials supply contracts for the LCS\u2013CAHE program not in\nexcess of $200,000 may use local competitive bidding (LCB) in accordance with standard\ngovernment  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Under  the  LCS\u2013CAHE  program,  civil  works\nestimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $50,000  or  less  may  be  procured  through  community\nparticipation in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. The proposed packaging and\ndraft bidding documents for the LCS-CAHE program should be submitted for prior review and\nconcurrence of ADB.\n70. Minor and off-the-shelf items such as office equipment and consumables, with cost not\nexceeding $100,000, will be procured by direct purchase. ADB\u2019s approval prior to the awarding\nof contracts will be required for all ICB contracts. Copies of all contracts not requiring prior ADB\napproval will be furnished to ADB for its review and consideration after contract award. If ADB\ndoes not concur with any decision taken by the Waterboard, ADB will not be committed to\nfinancing those contracts. The list of contract packages is in Appendix 8.\n71. The ADB anticorruption provisions (as provided in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement\nand Guidelines on the Use of Consultants) will apply to all expenditures financed under the loan.\nThis means that (i) ADB will reject a proposal for award if it finds that the proposed bidder has\nengaged in corrupt or fraudulent practices in competing for the contract in question; (ii) any\nexpenditures incurred with or through corrupt or fraudulent practices will not be reimbursable;\n(iii) any firm or individual found to have engaged in such practices will be declared ineligible,\neither indefinitely or for a stated period, for ADB-financed contracts; and (iv) where the Borrower\nhas  not  taken  timely  and  appropriate  remedial  action  when  such  practices  have  been\ncommitted, the relevant portions of the loan may be cancelled.\n3. Consulting Services\n72. All ADB-financed consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic\nconsultants.  As  the  Government  has  requested  that  internationally  recruited  consultants\ncollaborate with domestic consultants, there will be one consulting service package for overall\nproject management and the water supply and sanitation engineering design and supervision\n(71 person-months of international and 178 of domestic consultants). Capacity building in the", "19\nO&M component will require 9 persons-months of international and 16 of domestic consultants.\nAdditional separate consulting packages will combine capacity building for the Waterboard and\ncapacity  building  for  environmental  management  (21  person-months  international,  and  12\ndomestic), and the LCS-CAHE program (5 person-months international, and 363 domestic).\nTotal  consulting  services  will  be  106  international  person-months  and  569  domestic.  The\nconsultant inputs and summary TOR are in Appendix 7 and Supplementary Appendix F. ADB\napproved advance action for selecting the project management consultants, but approval does\nnot commit ADB to finance the Project.\n4. Disbursement Procedures\n73. The  Government  will  allocate  annual  counterpart  funds  for  expenditures  for  four\nconsecutive years. All disbursements for eligible expenditures will be made in accordance with\nADB\u2019s  disbursement  guidelines  following  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (1996). All\napplications for withdrawal of loan proceeds may use one of the following procedures: (i) direct\npayment, (ii) reimbursement procedures, and (iii) imprest fund procedure.\n(i) Direct payment. Under direct payment procedures, the Government, using ADB\u2019s\nstandard withdrawal application, requests ADB to pay the supplier of goods and\nservices  directly  from  the  loan  funds.  The  Government  will  indicate  in  the\nwithdrawal application the date on which payment becomes due to the supplier.\nA separate application will be filled out for each currency in which the payment is\nrequested. The application should be submitted with supporting documents such\nas contract invoice receipts and vouchers. This procedure will be used to pay for\n(a) consultant\u2019s fees, (b) civil works, and (c) procurement of goods. Copies of\nsigned contracts will be forwarded to ADB promptly to facilitate timely payments.\n(ii)  Reimbursement procedures. Reimbursement procedures are used when eligible\nexpenditures are paid from the Waterboard\u2019s budget and reimbursement claimed\nfrom ADB. The Waterbaord will prepare withdrawal applications with supporting\ndocuments and summary sheets of expenditures, and ADB will make payments\ndirectly to the Waterboard\u2019s account. The reimbursement procedure will be used\nto  pay  (a)  local  currency  costs,  (b)  small  purchases,  and  (c)  small  works\ncontracts.\n(iii)  Imprest  fund.  Under  the  imprest  fund  procedure,  ADB  provides  the  relevant\nborrower with funds in advance to meet expenditures to prefinance payments to\ncontractors and suppliers. The imprest account will be used for small civil works\nexpenditures, payment of indirect foreign exchange costs in local currency, and\nsmall purchases under all cost categories eligible for ADB financing. The ADB\nstatement of expenditure (SOE) procedure may be used for reimbursing eligible\nexpenditures and liquidating the imprest account for payments with value equal\nto or below $10,000 each. The imprest account will be in US dollars and the\nmaximum initial advance will be $300,000. The imprest account will be opened\nby the Government at a bank acceptable to ADB. Government contributions to\nthe Project will be maintained in a separate counterpart trust account. Further\ndisbursement details will be finalized during project inception.", "20\n5. Midterm Review\n74. In addition to regular loan reviews, a comprehensive midterm review will be carried out\nwhen all the detailed designs are completed and contracts are awarded, which will be about 24\nmonths after loan effectiveness. The review will evaluate the actual progress of each project\ncomponent; coordination, implementation procedures; monitoring and evaluation functions of\nthe PMU, PSC, PTIUs, PTCCs, LCS/CUs, and LCS/IUs; and performance of the consultants.\nThe  financial  performance  of  the  provincial  water  supply  and  sanitation  activities  and  the\nagreed-upon  cost  recovery  mechanisms  for  the  subprojects  will  be  reevaluated.  Remedial\naction will address identified problems, if any. The review will also determine the need for\nchanges in the original project design, implementation arrangements, and loan allocations, or\nmore  generally  identify  cost  overruns  and  other  factors  that  may  constrain  satisfactory\nimplementation of the Project.\n6. Reports and Accounts\n75. The Waterboard will submit to ADB quarterly project progress reports. The PMU, with\nassistance from the consultants, will collect and consolidate project information in a format\nacceptable to ADB. The format will be set in ADB\u2019s Project Administration Memorandum (PAM).\nThe Government and the Waterboard will maintain separate accounts for project expenditures\nand will furnish ADB with the Project's accounts and financial statements of the Waterboard.\nSuch project accounts and financial statements will be audited annually by independent auditors\nacceptable to ADB and submitted to ADB within nine months of the close of the relevant fiscal\nyear. The loan includes amounts for engaging independent auditors. The imprest account and\nSOE procedures will be audited as part of the regular audit of the project accounts and financial\nstatements, and audit opinion on the imprest account and SOE should be set out separately. A\nproject completion report will be submitted by the project director to the Government and ADB\nwithin  three  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project.  The  report  will  highlight  the\ndevelopment impacts of the Project.\n76. The PMU, with assistance from the consultants for project management support, will set\nup the project accounts in accordance with ADB and Government guidelines. The consultants\nwill also provide training and operating support to the PMU accounting staff in the use of these\naccounts in the initial stage of project implementation. The PMU, assisted by the consultants,\nwill  prepare  the  required  information  for  audit  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  project  auditing\nrequirements.\n7. Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation\n77. To ensure that the Project is managed efficiently and that the intended benefits are\nmaximized, a system for project performance management and evaluation (PPME) will be\ndeveloped in accordance with ADB's Guidelines (Supplementary Appendix F). Project benefit\nmonitoring and evaluation (BME) during the implementation period will be conducted by the\nPMU with the assistance of the provincial health department agencies as well as other relevant\nprovincial governments. For 24 months after the project is completed, the Waterboard will\ncontinue BME as part of its routine operations. For the duration of implementation (four years)\nand the following two years, the BME surveys will be carried out by the PMU at six-month\nintervals starting from project inception. Participatory, community, and beneficiary surveys will\nbe the basis for these evaluations. The officers responsible for BME will be well-experienced\nstaff with wide community consultation experience. The Waterboard will maintain all records for", "21\nthis and make such records available to ADB when required. BME will cover all the components\nof the Project.\n78. In addition, particular attention will be paid to the LCS program as its implementation\nduring the first 18 months is seen as a pilot to gauge community acceptance and preferences.\nThe project achievements will be periodically monitored against performance indicators by the\nPSC, PTCCs, and LCS/CUs. Benchmark information collected during project preparation will be\nupdated at the beginning of the Project. A special report will be prepared for the midterm review\nof the Project. Detailed arrangements for the LCS-CAHE program are in Appendix 4 and\nSupplementary Appendix F.\n8. Land Acquisition\n79. At present, no water supply and sanitation subprojects will require land outside town\nboundaries or alienated state land for their implementation. Detailed design of the subprojects\nwill  also  be  geared  to  minimizing  land  acquisition.  However,  it  is  recognized  that  some\nsubprojects may require the construction of infrastructure outside the town boundaries. Should\nthis occur, work will be planned to be alongside the existing facilities. In the unlikely event that\nsome land acquisition may be required, negotiations will be held with landowners, the provincial\ngovernment  and  town  administrations.  The  cost  estimates  have  used  a  high  physical\ncontingency of 20 percent to ensure that insufficient funds do not become a constraint in\nresolving such issues. While the Project does not involve population relocation, land will be\nacquired by the Government, as necessary, in accordance with the consultative and legal\nprocess under its Land Act and applicable ADB policies. In particular, the Government will\nacquire the required land or rights thereto on a timely basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on\nInvoluntary Resettlement and provide compensation including crop compensation, as required,\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant guidelines. The Waterboard, with support from the project\nmanagement consultants, will identify a program for resolving outstanding land disputes and\nclaims.\nG.  The Executing Agency\n80. The Executing and Implementing Agency is the PNG Waterboard. The Waterboard\u2019s\nexecutive  manager  for  technical  services  will  be  the  project  director.  The  Waterboard  will\nappoint a suitably qualified project manager to head the PMU in charge of implementing the\nProject. The Waterboard overall has a good record as Executing Agency for both TAs and\nloans.  It  has  shown  consistent  experience,  competence,  and  sufficient  resources  in\nimplementing ADB-funded projects. It has also demonstrated a good absorptive capacity for\ninstitutional  strengthening  and  project  implementation  and  a  firm  commitment  to  adopt\norganizational and policy changes required to increase its financial sustainability and enable it to\nfully carry out its mandate as the main water supply and sanitation agency in PNG.\n81. During  project  implementation,  the  Waterboard  will  be  supported  by  domestic  and\ninternational  consultants,  through  the  project  management  and  the  Waterboard  capacity\nbuilding  components.  The  latter  is  described  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  In  particular,\nWaterboard staff will receive support and training in (i) pursuing policy and institutional reform,\n(ii) improving its management information systems, (iii) strengthening its compliance functions,\n(iii) building public (institutional) awareness of Waterboard\u2019s plans and operations, (iv) improving\nO&M, (v) strengthening overall inspection and monitoring, and (vi) improving environmental\nmonitoring and management.", "22\nH.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n82. The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  and  an  initial  environmental\nexamination (IEE) was conducted for each subproject under the project preparatory TA study.\nNo  significant  adverse  effects  are  anticipated,  and  the  IEE  concludes  that  a  detailed\nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. The potential environmental impacts and\nmitigation measures are summarized in Appendix 9. The IEE indicates that the Project will\nimprove the environmental conditions in the project towns by (i) providing new and upgraded\nwater supplies to the towns of Kerema, Mendi, and Wabag; (ii) providing new and upgraded\nsewerage and treatment facilities to Alotau, Madang, and Mt. Hagen; and (iii) introducing a LCS\nprogram in Alotau, Lae, Madang, Mt. Hagen, and Wewak.\n83. For water supplies with surface sources (Wabag and Mendi surface water option), the\npossibility of abstraction interfering with the downstream river regime is assessed as minimal for\nthe sites chosen. For towns with groundwater sources (Kerema and Mendi groundwater option),\nthe possibility of abstraction interfering with and drying up the shallow wells in the area has\nbeen  examined.  The  average  borehole  depth  to  reach  the  aquifer  is  50  to  100  meters.\nAbstraction of water for the town supplies from an aquifer this deep is not expected to affect the\nshallow (phreatic) groundwater, which sustains shallow wells. The disposal of effluent and\nsludge  has  been  examined  for  the  towns  concerned.  At  the  detailed  design  stage,  the\nconsultants will be required to provide design, monitoring, and mitigation safeguards to ensure\ncompliance with the national environmental standards of PNG. For the LCS program, there is\nthe possibility of direct contamination of the shallow groundwater if the toilet tanks for any of the\nlatrines are not constructed with due care. This risk will be mitigated by requiring that the design\nand construction of the tanks follow appropriate technologies and, as necessary, watertightness\nrequirements.\n2.  Social Analysis\n84. The household survey indicates that water is a number one priority. The poor segments\nof the society suffer more from services inadequacies and unsanitary conditions than do the\nwider urban population. During the dry season, urban communities with no town water supply\nturn to alternative, often polluted, sources and risk exposure to waterborne diseases. Human\nwaste is polluting water sources used for drinking, washing clothes, and bathing. Statistics for\nurban towns indicate a high prevalence of typhoid, diarrhea, and skin diseases. The water and\nsanitation components are designed to improve basic services and the unacceptable health and\nenvironmental conditions.\n85. Active community involvement is essential to identify and address the felt need of the\npeople. Community and beneficiary participation was encouraged during project preparation.\nDiscussions were held with key stakeholders including central Government agencies, provincial\nand town governments as well as local communities, representatives of women's interests,\nNGOs, and the private sector. Socioeconomic surveys were conducted in all project provincial\ntowns.  Socioeconomic  and  technical  surveys,  key  interviews,  meetings,  and  workshops\n(particularly  on  the  parallel  LCS-CAHE  program)  with  provincial  and  town  agencies  and\nrepresentatives were organized and conducted during project preparation. As a result, the\nProject has comprehensive knowledge of the communities\u2019 background, needs, willingness to\npay, expectations, and social desires. The Project was designed to respond to those conditions", "23\nand to ensure outcomes that will have positive social impacts. A summary initial social analysis\nis presented in Appendix 10.\n86. Social measures were incorporated into the Project. For instance, the new water and\nsanitation pricing and tariff structure developed during project preparation in consultation with\nthe Waterboard sets rates affordable particularly to the poorer sections of the community. The\nabolition of direct costs for service connections for low-volume consumers and the inclusion of a\nminimum quantity \u201clifeline\u201d supply (12 kl) monthly at K3.5 are examples of the Waterboard\u2019s\nproactive recognition of the broad social needs.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1. Financial Viability and Cost Recovery\n87. In  accordance  with  the  financial  viability  requirements  of  the  Waterboard  and  cost\nrecovery objectives of ADB, proposed subproject tariffs were set to achieve cost recovery. No\nlong-term subsidies are required. The proposed tariffs are set to recover full O&M costs of the\nfacilities, including administration costs at the district level, full depreciation on assets, interest\npayable on the ADB loan, and incremental head office costs. In the medium to long term, the\nsubprojects will also yield a small return of around 2 percent.\n2. Financial Appraisal\n88. Each subproject was financially appraised in real terms using constant June 2000 prices.\nFor all subprojects, the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) compared favorably with the\nweighted average cost of capital of negative 0.6 percent for water supply subprojects and\nnegative 0.8 percent for sewerage subprojects. Average incremental financial revenues (AIFR)\nexceeded average incremental financial costs (AIFC) for all. Sensitivity tests showed that each\nsubproject can withstand adverse cost and revenue scenarios. The financial analysis and the\nWaterboard financial projections are presented in Appendix 11.\n3. Affordability\n89. The Waterboard recently introduced a lifeline tariff of K3.50 for the first 12 kl of water\nand K4.86 for sewerage for the poor. While connection is voluntary, connection charges were\nalso abolished to give the poor access to the basic services of water supply and sewerage.\n90. The affordability analysis incorporates the current block tariff system, which charges\ndifferent rates for domestic and nondomestic customers and for different volumes consumed.\nFor subprojects to be affordable to domestic customers, while maintaining individual financial\nviability,  some  degree  of  cross-subsidization  is  needed  from  nondomestic  to  domestic\ncustomers  and  from  higher  volume  customers  (those  in  higher  income  brackets)  to  lower\nvolume customers (including the poor).\n91. The affordability analysis demonstrates that, with careful structuring of tariffs within the\ncurrent block system, subprojects can be made more affordable without compromising financial\nobjectives. The analysis calculates a possible tariff structure that, given current consumption\npatterns  across  comparable  towns,  will  achieve  the  required  average  tariffs  while  keeping\nhousehold bills at affordable levels.", "24\n92. In all cases, the nondomestic high-volume user was the main target to absorb most of\nthe impact resulting from adoption of the proposed structure where costs to the lower volume\nand  domestic  users  are  kept  at  affordable  levels.  In  addition,  any  tariff  increase  must  be\ncarefully structured to take account of price and income elasticity of users, and the need for\ncompliance,  regulation,  and  enforcement,  which  will  be  critical  where  nondomestic,  large-\nvolume charges are high.\n4. Economic Analysis\n93. Least-cost analysis at the prefeasibility stage compared viable technical alternatives,\nwhere available. In all cases the least-cost alternative was the chosen subproject option. Where\non-site sanitation proved to be the least-cost option, the subproject was included under the LCS\ncomponent.\n94. The economic analysis was for 25 years inclusive of the project construction period, in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Economic benefits\nand costs were denominated in the domestic price numeraire and expressed in constant June\n2000 prices. Project benefits and costs were estimated on a without- or with-project basis\nappropriately  apportioned  on  the  basis  of  the  components  being  tradable  or  nontradable.\nTradable components were adjusted to economic prices using a shadow exchange rate factor of\n1.1, and nontraded components were valued at domestic market prices. No other conversion\nfactors were applied.\n95. For the water supply subprojects, nonincremental benefits were valued based on the\nexisting supply price and incremental benefits were valued based on incremental revenues.\nNon-technical losses and a small allowance for resource savings in O&M were included. For\nsewerage  subprojects,  benefits  were  valued  based  on  incremental  revenues  and  on  the\nestimated reduction in the use of medicines resulting from a lower incidence of waterborne\ndisease, the benefits amounting to about K3.5 per person, which represents about 20 percent of\nprovincial spending on public health.\n96. For both water supply and sewerage subprojects, the base case economic internal rate\nof return (EIRR) exceeds the assumed 10 percent economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC)\nwith the lowest EIRR being for Alotau sewerage where the base case EIRR is 11.4 percent.\nWhile some of the calculated EIRRs are relatively low compared with the assumed EOCC of 10\npercent, under the project significant economic benefits will be generated, particularly public\nhealth benefits, amenity values, and indirect economic benefits. However, these benefits are not\nfully valued and reflected in the EIRR analysis. All subprojects are believed to be economically\nviable.  The  economic  analysis  including  base  case  EIRR,  net  present  value  (NPV)  and\nswitching values (SV) is presented in Appendix 12.\nB.  Environment\n97. The Project will significantly improve the urban environment and quality of life for the\ncommunities in the project towns. The people living in the project towns (Alotau, Kerema, Lae,\nMadang, Mendi, Mt. Hagen, Wabag, and Wewak) currently do not have adequate safe, secure,\nwater supplies or sanitation. Lack of these basic facilities and the consequent environmental\ndegradation result in very high levels of preventable waterborne intestinal diseases (diarrhea,\ndysentery). These are reflected in the very poor public health indicators.", "25\n98. In  addition,  the  Project  addresses  the  present  lack  of  environmental  management\ncapacity  within  the  Waterboard  through  the  environmental  management  capacity  building\ncomponent. The broad aim is to enable the Waterboard to become a responsible \u201ccorporate\ncitizen,\u201d  fully  aware  of  all  the  possible  impacts  of  its  operations  and  their  effects  on  the\nenvironment while carrying out its mandated functions. This component will provide technical\nand institutional advice and training to strengthen the Waterboard\u2019s environmental management\ncapacities  for  higher  levels  of  pollution  prevention,  better  monitoring  and  compliance  with\nstandards and wastewater minimization. Selected officials of the Waterboard will be trained. It is\nexpected  that  nominees  from  DOH,  Office  of  Environment  and  Conservation,  and  related\nInstitutions will also participate and thus ensure that the training program will have a broader\nimpact for better management of the environment.\nC.  Social Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n99.  In PNG towns, as is typical in many developing countries, it is most often the poor who\ndo not have easy access to safe water supply and safe excreta disposal. Low incomes go\ntogether  with  general  absence  of  basic  services.  Poverty  engenders  more  poverty  unless\nconscious efforts are made to break the vicious cycle. This points to the need for including more\nsocial  indicators  in  appraising  the  viability  of  projects.  About  16  percent  of  PNG\u2019s  urban\npopulation are categorized as poor. These people and the broader community stand to benefit\nfrom the project. Among PNG\u2019s urban poor are squatters, unemployed and underemployed,\nlow-income families that are often very large. As populations have increased, particularly in\nsquatter settlements and urban areas, environmental conditions have suffered and public health\nhas deteriorated.\n100. Lack of water during the dry season is a difficulty experienced all over PNG. A reliable\nyear-round  supply  of  clean  water  is  essential  to  ensure  good  health.  The  shift  by  the\nWaterboard to a strong and proactive stance in customer services coupled with the decision to\nprovide better services to existing and potential customers is a step in the right direction.\n101. Improvements to general sanitation through both the sewerage and the parallel LCS-\nCAHE program will ensure that better health and improved quality of life are spread to a wider\nsection of the population, than through a sewerage system alone. Sewerage systems in towns\nand  cities  throughout  the  developing  world  usually  serve  only  a  small  proportion  of  the\npopulation, typically the richer residential, commercial, or government areas. The low population\ndensities and rugged terrain of most provincial towns make it difficult to justify the cost of\nsewerage schemes for every town for most of the settlements. The LCS-CAHE program will\nallow a greater number of low-income urban dwellers and the urban poor to benefit from the\nproject. The primary beneficiaries of LCS-CAHE will have lower levels of pollution and incidence\nof less preventable illnesses, more time for productive use, and the resulting better opportunities\nfor economic improvement. The need for low-cost on-site schemes was emphasized by ADB in\nits Urban Sector Profile in 1992.\n102. Workshops participated in by all stakeholders were held in selected provincial towns in\nthe  second  phase  of  project  preparation  to  identify  and  discuss  the  main  findings  and\nrecommendations of the TA final report, and to seek feedback and commitment to the Project,\nparticularly with regard to the proposed LCS-CAHE program. The Appraisal Mission visited the\nselected urban settlements for the pilot phase of the program. The level of support for both\nwater supply and sewerage subprojects and for the LCS VIPL program was clearly positive. The\nLCS-CAHE  program  will  involve  community  mobilization,  participatory  planning  with  the", "26\ncommunities,  NGOs,  and  the  provincial  town  administrations.  Active  involvement  of  the\ncommunity will be maximized and the social impacts of the proposed Project enhanced.\n103.  The Project will also assist in improving the hygiene education of poorer households by\nraising awareness of health and sanitation issues through the parallel LCS-CAHE program. It\nwill benefit households financially by providing information and ideas on water conservation and\nvarious methods to reduce expenditure, including simple water tap maintenance. The Project\nwill improve the availability of safe water in the project towns and eliminate the substantial time\nspent daily by the family, especially the women, in fetching water and enable them to attend to\nmore productive tasks.\nD.  Benefits and Risks\n1.  Benefits\n104. The Project will assist the PNG Waterboard in pursuing its mandate of enhancing the\ndelivery of water supply and sanitation services to the communities in PNG. The Project will\naddress basic needs and poverty reduction by improving overall health status, living conditions\nand lifestyle, and specifically ensuring that poorer beneficiaries are not unduly economically\nburdened. Through its components, the Project aims in particular to (i) improve the coverage of\nwater supply to give a greater number of people access to safe water; and (ii) increase the\nquantity of water available through improved and more cost-effective delivery of the services.\nThis includes new supplies, upgrading existing ones, 24-hour service, and loss reduction.\n105. Providing appropriate and adequate systems for the safe disposal of human waste is the\nother key component of the Project. This will be achieved by rehabilitating sewerage systems\nand treating sewage, where possible, through the sewerage component of the main project. In\naddition, the parallel LCS-CAHE program will address the problems generated by indiscriminate\ndefecation and the need for health education in the selected towns. This will result in substantial\nimprovement in public health and environmental conditions for the community in the long term.\nThe LCS-CAHE program will therefore enhance the positive health impacts and overall poverty\nreduction benefits of the main project. The Project and the parallel LCS-CAHE program meet\nthe objectives of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.\n2.  Health Impacts\n106. Health  statistics  in  the  provincial  towns  show  that  inadequate  water  supply  and\nsanitation,  poor  living  conditions,  and  bad  health  and  hygiene  practices  contribute  to  the\nprevalence of preventable intestinal diseases. Typhoid, diarrhea, dysentery, skin diseases, and\nintestinal worms are common and are easily transmitted. The elderly, very young, and infirm are\nat considerable risk of death from some of these illnesses. Diarrhea is one of the leading causes\nof infant mortality in PNG. The LCS-CAHE program will cover all aspects of community health-\nrelated issues.\n107. The sewerage component of the project and the LCS-CAHE program activities will\nimprove hygiene and living conditions for residents in Alotau, Madang, and Mt. Hagen. These\ntowns have problems with overflowing septic toilets, unsanitary bucket toilets, and unhygienic pit\nlatrines. Adequate sanitation, through the isolation and safe containment of feces, is the first\nstep in improving public health. Improved sanitation will also address environmental conditions\nsuch  as  bad  smell,  sewage  overflows  or  effluent  seepage,  and  other  concerns  raised  by\nhouseholders  in  the  survey.  Sewerage  system  improvements  will  reduce  the  potential  for\ncontamination of shallow wells and open water.", "27\n108. Provision of piped treated water to Kerema, where 96 percent of households rely on\nrainwater and 4 percent use bores or wells, will reduce the incidence of illness during the dry\nseason and periods of extended drought. At present, when rainwater supplies are exhausted in\na few months, households depend on alternative water supplies, which are often of poor quality\nand  contaminated  bacteriologically  or  otherwise.  Similarly,  improvements  to  water  supply\nquantity and quality in Wabag will greatly reduce waterborne illness there. The incidence of\ndiarrhea, which ranks seventh as cause of death, is very high in Wabag district. The project\npreparation household survey reported more cases of typhoid for Wabag than for any other\ntown. Typhoid ranked fourth as cause of death in Wabag district, with 19.2 deaths per 100,000\npeople between 1995 and 1997 (DOH). A continuously treated water supply will significantly\nimprove health conditions for Wabag residents.\n3.  Gender Impact\n109. In PNG, as in many other developing member countries, the responsibility for water\ncollection, which often takes considerable effort, labor and time, falls on women. It is also the\nwomen  who  provide  most  of  the  work  in  maintaining  the  household  and  caring  for  small\nchildren, the elderly, and the sick in the family. Through adequate sanitation, the incidence of\nthe now common preventable intestinal diseases will be considerably reduced. This will mean\nnot only improving health generally, but also considerably reducing the time that women have to\nspend caring for the sick, and freeing them to use that time more profitably. The Project will\nbenefit women in two specific ways. First, through the LCS-CAHE program, women will be\ntargeted for sanitation awareness training and they will benefit significantly from education\nbuilding on water use and hygiene. This information will give them control and choice in the way\nthey care for families, and manage water resources and household finances. Second, the\nprovision of safe and easily accessible water means that the time women spend in fetching\nwater will be obviated. Active involvement of women during planning and implementing the\nLCS-CAHE program will provide them with opportunities to decide on issues that affect their\ndaily lives and the well-being of their families.\n4. Risks\n110. The main risks to the Project and the parallel LCS-CAHE program are (i) the potential\nunwillingness of the provincial governments and local councils to work with the Waterboard and\ncommit funds to support project implementation with respect, in particular, to the LCS-CAHE\nprogram; (ii) inadequate available resources for counterpart assistance and resourcing of the\nPMU, PTIUs, LCS/CUs and LCS/IUs; (iii) slow project implementation and ineffective project\nmanagement due to insufficient number of trained staff with experience in externally funded\nprojects; (iv) unresolvable land acquisition issues; (v) slow implementation of the LCS-CAHE\nprogram due to limited community participation and lack of trained local government staff; (vi)\nimproper  selection  of  settlements  in  a  way  that  does  not  meet  community  priorities,  e.g.,\nsettlements with very limited water availability and (vii) vandalism and destruction of piped\nnetworks and VIPLs due to low security in the project areas and LCS selected settlements.\n111. The attitude, level of support, and commitment of the provincial and local governments\nhave  been  assessed  as  positive  as  a  result  of  the  workshops  carried  out  during  project\npreparation. The assessment was confirmed in subsequent field visits during project fact-finding\nand appraisal. The required provincial counterpart contributions for the LCS-CAHE program\nwere confirmed during appraisal. During project preparation, civic society groups, NGOs, and\nlocal communities expressed their firm willingness to be involved in project implementation,\nparticularly in the LCS-CAHE program. With this level of enthusiasm and able support from the", "28\nWaterboard, the project is well positioned to achieve its goals. As indicated earlier, the PNG\nWaterboard has considerable experience and evident competence in managing aid-funded loan\nprojects. It has the capabilities required, but the demand for the secondment of resources could\nstretch the organization should the need come on top of other demands. Strong international\nconsultant assistance is proposed to bolster the resources for project management and to assist\nthe Waterboard in this regard. With respect to the land acquisition risks, (para. 83), during\nproject preparation all efforts were made to minimize land requirements. As a result, no water\nsupply and sewerage subprojects are envisaged to require land outside town boundaries or\nalienated State land. In any case, the Waterboard with support from the project management\nconsultants will develop a program to address and resolve outstanding and potential land\ndisputes and claims. With regard to vandalism and possible lack of community demand for LCS,\nthese risks will be minimized through the highly participatory and community-based approaches\nthat will be used in planning, designing, and implementing the LCS-CAHE program. Through\nthis process the poor and low-income households will have the opportunity to confirm their\nwillingness to contribute and demonstrate their interest and motivation to participate.\nVI.  THE JFPR FUNDED PROGRAM (LCS-CAHE)\nA.  Rationale\n112. Although some reticulated water supplies and sewerage systems are proposed in the\nmain  project,  for  reasons  of  nonviable  population  groupings,  physical  and  topographic\nhindrances and high unit cost per head, developing additional reticulated sewerage in most of\nthe other provincial towns is not economically and financially viable and is thus not included. For\nthese populations, the proposed community- and individual household-based LCS activities\nprovide the best option. The LCS program is planned for three years, with the first 18 months to\nbe implemented as a pilot trial covering only the towns of Lae and Madang. During the pilot trial,\nlow-cost ventilated improved pit latrine (VIPL) systems will be introduced in selected settlements\nat the urban boundary and in the settlements on the periphery of the urban boundary.\n113. The LCS program aims to provide appropriate and affordable sanitation for the poor in\nthe target towns. The urban poor often resort to informal and ad hoc methods to dispose of\nhuman waste, directly causing the high incidence of preventable intestinal diseases - diarrhea\nand dysentery - which are endemic in most towns. The causes of such behavior are not only the\ninability to afford sanitation but also lack of general public health and hygiene knowledge and\nawareness. It is evident that the communities do not understand the cause-effect relationship\nbetween sanitation or hygiene and waterborne diseases. To rectify this and ensure that the\nsanitation interventions of the Project have a long-lasting effect on the target population, the\nLCS  program  is  combined  with  the  CAHE  program.  The  CAHE  program  will  specifically\ndisseminate  basic  knowledge  to  the  target  populations  in  a  simple  format  that  can  be\nunderstood  and  accepted  by  ordinary  citizens,  for  eventual  change  of  behavior  regarding\nhousehold and personal hygiene. The LCS-CAHE program is expected to have significant\npositive results in the long-lasting improvement of general public health for all the program\ntowns' residents, particularly the poor.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n114. As a highly complementary part of the main project, the LCS-CAHE program will offer a\nsolution to inadequate sanitation by (i) providing options to improve sanitation standards, and (ii)\nenhance  overall  health  and  environmental  conditions  in  the  project  provincial  towns.  The\nprimary objective of the program is public health improvement and poverty reduction in the", "29\nselected provincial towns. In addition, the program will involve a participatory approach that\nincludes individual households and the community in developing affordable on-site sanitation\nsolutions. The scope will include two major activities: (i) providing LCS schemes to urban\nresidents particularly in the poorer urban settlements in Alotau, Lae, Madang, Mt. Hagen, and\nWewak; and (ii) undertaking of CAHE program activities to improve communities\u2019 knowledge of\nthe linkages between water, sanitation, and health, as well as to develop community networks\nand  institutional  arrangements  between  the  Waterboard,  the  local  governments,  and  other\nstakeholders  to  support  the  low-cost  sanitation  projects  and  related  training.  A  summary\ndescription  of  the  LCS-CAHE  program,  as  well  as  its  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,\nimplementation  arrangements,  poverty  reduction  impact,  and  benefits  and  risks  are  all  in\nAppendix 4.\nVII.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n115. The Government and the Waterboard have given the following assurances, in addition to\nthe standard assurances which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i) Counterpart funds. The Government will ensure during each year of project\nimplementation, timely and regular (a) submission of necessary requests for\nannual  budgetary  appropriations  and  disbursements  of  required  counterpart\nfunds; and (b) release of such funds by the relevant authorities to facilitate\nproject implementation.\n(ii) Cofinancing. If the Government is unable to obtain the AusAID grant within six\nmonths of loan effectiveness, it will (a) enter into other arrangements, satisfactory\nto  ADB,  to  obtain  the  required  additional  funding  necessary  for  timely  and\neffective implementation of the sector policy reform and Waterboard capacity\nbuilding component; or (b) provide additional counterpart funds to finance any\nshortfall resulting from the Government's inability to obtain the AusAID grant or\nthe alternative funding.\n(iii) Project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PPME).

The Government will ensure that at least 50 percent of the community\nrepresentatives who are members of each PTCC will be women.\n(v) Waterboard  operations.  The  Waterboard  will  implement  its  first  five-year\ncorporate plan (1999-2003) including: (a) maintaining a collection rate of not less\nthan  90  percent;  (b)  ensuring  that  its  average  nonrevenue  water  from  all\nWaterboard districts will not be more than 20 percent by 31 March 2005; and (c)\nensuring  that  the  percentage  of  current  receivables  due  from  Waterboard\ncustomers outstanding for more than 90 days will not exceed 15 percent of the\ntotal value of all current receivables payable to the Waterboard.\n(vi) Cost recovery. The Waterboard will increase water supply and sewerage tariffs\nduring  project  implementation  from  current  levels  to  ensure  operational  cost\nrecovery. To this end, the Waterboard will prepare and submit the necessary\napplications for tariff increases to government authorities concerned to ensure\nthat, on or before 30 September 2005, the applicable average tariff rates charged", "30\nto consumers will not be less than approximately K1.3/kl for water and K0.5/kl for\nsewerage (in constant March 2000 prices).\n(vii)  Operations and maintenance (O&M). The Waterboard will ensure that necessary\nexpenditures  are  incurred  to  maintain  and  operate  its  assets,  so  that  (a)\ncontinuous water supply and sanitation services are provided in districts in which\nit operates so that the average number of hours of water supply in any town does\nnot fall below 20 hours per day, and (b) the quality of water supplied to districts in\nwhich it operates conforms to current World Health Organization standards. For\nmonitoring (a) and (b), the Waterboard will maintain records of daily hours of\nwater supplied and results of periodic water testing.\nThe Waterboard further undertakes (a) to increase O&M expenditure from the\ncurrent rate of 0.5 percent to not less than 1 percent on the average asset value\nof the Waterboard in any year; (b) to prepare and implement an O&M action plan,\non terms and with time-bound milestones acceptable to ADB, to improve its O&M\nof  water  supply  and  sewerage  systems,  including  improvements  in  related\nenvironmental management; and (c) ensure that annual budgeted amounts for\nO&M expenditures are used exclusively for O&M purposes.\n(viii) Environment. The Waterboard will ensure, that the environmental mitigation and\nmonitoring measures recommended in the IEE for the Project will be followed in\ndesign and implementation of the Project, including: (a) for the water supply\nsubprojects, that regular monitoring will be undertaken of (i) abstraction of water\nfrom  aquifiers  and  its  impact  on  the  level  of  available  surrounding  shallow\ngroundwater; and (ii) the downstream flow of Mangani River and Pagwa Creek\nbelow the relevant abstraction points and related impacts, if any, on downstream\nusers  and  fish  and  wildlife,  and  timely  measures  to  mitigate  any  adverse\nenvironmental impacts monitored under (i) and (ii) will also be undertaken; and\n(b) for the sewerage subprojects, that sewerage works and treatment, including\nconstruction of facilities, disposal of sludge, and discharge of effluent, will comply\nwith applicable national standards of the Borrower and relevant ADB guidelines.\nFurther, the Waterboard shall ensure that training will be provided for senior and\noperational  staff  in  environmental  awareness,  with  particular  reference  to\nWaterboard activities including Project implementation, in form and substance\nacceptable to ADB.\n(ix) Land. The Government will ensure that all (a) title to land (and related easements\nor rights-of-way) required for each water supply and sewerage (WSS) subproject\nwill have been obtained in a timely manner to ensure proper commencement and\ncompletion  of  the  related  WSS  subproject  activities,  and  to  such  end  the\nGovernment will provide satisfactory evidence to ADB in the proposal submitted\nto  ADB  for  financing  of  such  WSS  Project,  that  the  land  (or  any  related\neasements or rights-of-way therein) has been obtained; and (b) land acquisition\nunder  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on\nInvoluntary Resettlement.\n(x) Privatization. The Government will ensure that any proposal for privatization of\nthe Waterboard through sale of more than 20 percent of the Government's equity\nand/or transfer of management of any part of the operations of the Waterboard to\nthe private sector by way of lease, concession, or otherwise will be submitted to\nADB for prior review and comment.", "31\n(xi) Audit.  The  Government  shall  cause  the  Waterboard  to  ensure  that  any\nindependent auditors financed under the loan will be selected and engaged in\naccordance with competitive selection procedures acceptable to ADB.\n(xii) Mid-term  review.  The  Government  will  carry  out  a  comprehensive  mid-term\nreview no later than the expiry of 24 months from the loan effectiveness.\nB. Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n116. The Government has agreed to complete the following, prior to loan effectiveness, in\nform and substance satisfactory to ADB:\n(i)  A PTCC will have been established for each of the provincial towns participating\nunder the WSS subprojects component of the Project.\n(ii) The  Government  and  the  Waterboard  will  have  executed  a  subsidiary  loan\nagreement, on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB, for the Government to\nrelend the loan proceeds to the Waterboard for the purposes of the Project.\nVIII.

Background and Rationale\n1. Papua New Guinea (PNG) is the poorest country among the Pacific developing member\ncountries (PDMCs). An estimated 17 percent of the population are hard core poor falling below\nthe food poverty line, while 37 percent live below a poverty line of $350 per year.1 Prevailing\nenvironmental  conditions  in  provincial  towns  have  significant  adverse  impacts  on  people's\nhealth and quality of life with negative impacts on their human and economic development.\nImproving basic urban services, particularly water supply and sanitation, is directly linked to the\ngoal of improving public health and overall social indicators. Large sections of urban society\nsuffer  from  service  inadequacies  and  unsanitary  conditions,  with  the  poor  suffering\ndisproportionately more. Urban water supply and sewerage coverage is about 43 percent and\n20  percent  respectively.  Communities  in  selected  towns  put  water  and  sanitation  as  their\nnumber one priority, with lack of water during the dry season being a very serious and universal\nproblem. Sanitation is also generally inadequate and where sewerage systems exist, most of\nthem serve the developed sections of towns. Thus for many communities on the urban fringes,\ndefecating in open air is common practice.\n2. The poorest households in the component towns of Alotau, Lae, Madang, Mt. Hagen,\nand Wewak live in unsanitary conditions and the present practices in human waste disposal\nharm  their  health  and  pollute  the  environment.  The  high  incidence  of  diarrhea  and  other\nwaterborne, preventable intestinal diseases among the urban poor in the provincial towns is\nhigh.  Lack  of  awareness  of  the  relationship  between  basic  cleanliness,  hygiene,  and  the\npathogens of waterborne intestinal diseases is seen as a major issue in public health.\n3. It is against this backdrop that the low-cost sanitation, community awareness and health\neducation program is proposed. The logical framework for this program is in Table A4.1 (page\n13).\n4. The LCS-CAHE program is a highly complementary and additional part to the overall\nProject. Grant financing from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) is required because\nthe PNG Waterboard, a commercial statutory authority, is unwilling to borrow for an innovative\nand  highly  participatory  program  where  short-term  financial  viability  is  not  yet  proven.  In\naddition, funding from JFPR is appropriate as it will allow the Waterboard to fulfill its wider social\nfunction and help prove the viability of a new sanitation technology in PNG.\nB.  Objectives\n5. The long-term goal of the LCS-CAHE program is health improvement for the population,\nparticularly the poor in provincial towns, to enhance their standard of living through lower health\nexpenditures, higher labor productivity, and increased income-earning opportunities. The main\nobjective is to provide poor urban dwellers affordable, environment-friendly, and appropriate\nsanitation facilities and to bring about positive behavioral changes in sanitation practices.\nC.  Scope\n6. The LCS-CAHE program will include two major activities: (i) low-cost sanitation (LCS) to\nprovide low-income groups and the urban poor with easy access to low-cost basic sanitation\nfacilities, and (ii) community awareness and health education (CAHE) to build awareness and\n                                                \n1 World Bank 1999 Papua New Guinea: Poverty and Access to Public Services, Report No. 19884-PNG, October\n1999.", "40\nAppendix 4, page 2\nimprove health education for the communities. The targeted beneficiary communities have been\nidentified. The CAHE program activities will be implemented in selected urban and peri-urban\nsettlements  where  unhealthy  waste  disposal  systems  (e.g.,  bucket  system  and  simple  pit\nlatrines)  exist  and  where  a  reticulated  sewerage  system  would  be  too  expensive.\nImplementation of the LCS program activities will start in selected settlements in Lae and\nMadang where 2,400 ventilated improved pit latrines (VIPLs) will be installed. During the second\nphase of implementation, an additional 1,800 VIPLs will be installed in selected urban and peri-\nurban settlements in Alotau, Mt. Hagen, and Wewak.\n7. Low-Cost Sanitation. The LCS program activities provide for the construction and\nmaintenance of low-cost sanitation facilities such as VIPLs will involve participatory planning\nwith the targeted beneficiary households. During project preparation, needs were assessed in\nthe  field.  It  was  found  that  about  8,620  poor  households  in  the  urban  settlements  of  the\nprovincial  project  towns  need  improved  sanitation.  The  program  will  construct  low-cost\nsanitation facilities for the most needy 4,200 households (36,000 people), about half of the total\npotential demand. It will provide funds for construction costs, and the beneficiary households will\nshare through in-kind contributions such as materials and labor. The required funding will give\nthe  initial  impetus  to  the  provision  of  much-needed  sanitation  services.  The  LCS  will  be\nimplemented  over  three  years  with  an  initial  18  months  pilot-testing  period  in  poor  urban\ncommunities  in  Lae  and  Madang2.  During  this  learn-as-you-go  phase,  workable,  socially\nsensitive,  and  cost-effective  approaches  to  LCS-CAHE  interventions  will  be  developed,\nproviding a model for building a community sense of ownership and involvement. The situation\nwill be replicated more extensively in all provincial towns during the remaining 18 months of the\nimplementation  period.  The  total  duration  of  the  project  will  be  36  months,  with  start-up\nexpected in April 2001 and completion in April 2004 (Table A4.2).\nTable A4.2: Implementation Schedule\nProgram Activities III-2001 2002 2003 II-2004\n\u2022  Recruit Consultants\n\u2022  Planning & Development of LCS\nProgram\n\u2022  Pilot Test in Madang and Lae                                \n \n\u2022  Continue Implementation in                                \nMadang and Lae\n\u2022  Implementation in Alotau, Mt.                                \nHagen and Wewak\n\u2022  Monitoring                                \n \n\u2022  Evaluation\n8. Community Awareness and Health Education. The LCS subprogram will build on\ninterventions that are part of the CAHE subprogram. Household surveys in the targeted project\ncommunities and field investigations have confirmed a very low level of understanding of water\nand  sanitation-related  issues,  particularly  the  linkages  between  water,  sanitation,  personal\nhygiene, and good health. The health awareness campaigns under the CAHE subprogram will\n                                                \n2 During appraisal, participatory consultations were held with the beneficiaries as well as provincial and town\nauthorities for the initial selection of target settlements. For Lae, the following settlements were identified: Bundi,\nNawae and settlements 2,3 and 4. For Madang, the settlement of Sisiak was selected for the pilot phase.", "41\nAppendix 4, page 3\neducate people in appropriate toilet use and maintenance, and provide information on the health\nsanitation  linkages.  The  CAHE  activities  will  be  instrumental  in  mobilizing  the  targeted\ncommunities to introduce low-cost sanitation practices. As women are primarily responsible for\nmaintaining household sanitation conditions, a special project focus will be on existing women's\ngroups and the formation of new ones to help achieve positive behavioral changes in sanitation\npractices.\n9. The CAHE program will be implemented in all program towns. Awareness building is key\nto ensuring the long-lasting effects of public health knowledge within the communities. As the\nmost common source of bacteriological pollution to water sources is the indiscriminate disposal\nof fecal matter by the general public, the CAHE program is designed to address the problem\ndirectly to effect major changes in personal behavior. The aim is to impart knowledge of general\npersonal hygiene, the cause effect relationship between pathogens and illnesses (particularly\ndiarrhea, dysentery, typhoid, etc), effectively so that it is readily understood and accepted by the\ncommunities. Simple cartoon style handouts, together with mass media programs will be utilized\nto effectively disseminate this knowledge.\nD.  Costs and Financing Plan\n10. The  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $2.2  million  equivalent,  including  contingencies.  The\nforeign exchange part is estimated at $0.5 million, or 21 percent of total cost. Local currency\ncosts are estimated at $1.7 million equivalent or 79 percent of total cost. Of the total cost of $2.2\nmillion equivalent, $0.1 million equivalent will be financed by the beneficiaries, $0.3 million\nequivalent by the provincial and local governments, and the remainder ($1.74 million equivalent)\nis proposed to be financed by JFPR. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Table A4.3.\n11. Since the LCS-CAHE program will be for the low-income and poor people, households'\ncontributions will be mainly in the form of labor and partial cost of the VIPL materials. The cash\ncontribution will be determined with the community during the planning stage. The experiences\nof NGOs working in Lae in VIPL programs suggests that cash contributions for materials will be\nabout 10 percent. During project appraisal, field visits to the urban settlements indicated that the\nhouseholds were willing to pay cash as partial contribution for the VIPL materials.\nTable A4.3: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($ '000)\nItem Foreign Local Total Cost Percent\nExchange Currency\nA.

Executing and Implementing Agencies\n12. The Waterboard will be the Executing Agency for the program. However, the urban\nauthorities of the respective provincial towns will be the Implementing Agencies and will play a\nkey role. For each selected provincial town, a LCS-CAHE Coordination Unit (LCS/CU) and a\nLCS-CAHE Implementation Unit (LCS/IU) will be established in the relevant urban council\n(Figure A1, page 6). The LCS/CU will coordinate and oversee project operations and will deal\nwith  project-related  policy  matters.  The  LCS/IU  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the\nprogram. The national coordinator (domestic consultant) and the international consultant will\nadvise the LCS/CU and will assist the LCS/IU in implementing the program.\n2. Detailed Implementation and Coordination Arrangements\n13. The LCS-CAHE program will be implemented over three years. The Waterboard will be\nthe Executing Agency and will provide suitable counterpart staff as required. The costs for the\ninternational  consultants  (LCS  environmental  engineer,  LCS  project  accountant/financial\nanalyst)  and  domestic  consultants  (LCS  manager-headquarters-national  coordinator,  CAHE\nnational coordinator, computer aided design draftsperson, LCS provincial team coordinators,\nand LCS facilitators) will be covered by the budget of this component.\n14. Given the complex nature of this program, separate coordination and implementation\nunits will be established at the provincial level. An LCS-CAHE coordination unit (LCS/CU) and\nan LCS-CAHE implementation unit (LCS/IU) will be established in the provincial town offices of\nthe relevant urban council within three months of loan effectiveness. The LCS/CU will oversee,\nguide,  and  monitor  program  operations  and  will  deal  with  program-related  policy  and\ncoordination matters. The LCS/IU will be responsible for implementing the component.\n15. The LCS/CU will comprise the provincial administrator as the chair, town manager,\nWaterboard  district  manager,  director  of  health  and  community  service-urban  local-level\ngovernment council (ULLGC), provincial advisor for health, president of the urban local-level\ngovernment women\u2019s council, an NGO representative of women's interests, a representative of\nthe NGOs, and representatives of selected communities.\n16. The LCS/IU will consist of the LCS provincial team coordinator as the manager, LCS\nfacilitators, representatives of provincial health staff, ULLGC health staff, Waterboard staff,\ncommunity development officer of the relevant ward, a representative of the relevant women\u2019s\ncouncil, representatives of NGOs, and representatives of selected communities. The national\ncoordinator of the LCS\u2013CAHE program (domestic consultant) and the international consultants\nwill  advise  the  LCS/CU  and  will  assist  the  LCS/IU  in  implementing  the  program.  The\nparticipation of the communities and NGOs in the LCS/CU and LCS/IU will ensure active\ncommunity involvement at higher levels of management, planning, and implementation of the\nLCS-CAHE  program.  The  female  representatives  from  the  communities  and  the  women\u2019s\ncouncil  will  provide  the  required  inputs  in  addressing  gender  dimensions  in  planning  and\nimplementing the sanitation facilities, and increase overall women\u2019s participation in health and\nhygiene awareness activities.\n17.  The LCS-CAHE program will be implemented over the first three years of the project.\nThe first 18 months of implementation will take the form of a pilot trial. In selected urban and\nperi-urban settlements of Lae and Madang with water supply connections from the Waterboard,\none VIPL per household will be constructed. Lessons learned from the pilot phase will be used\nto expand the area in the second phase to include the towns of Alotau, Mt. Hagen, and Wewak.\nDuring the second phase, settlements depending on rainwater, shallow water wells, spring, and\nother water sources will also be selected.", "43\nAppendix 4, page 5\n18. The LCS-CAHE program envisages wide dissemination of basic hygiene principles and\nsanitation  awareness  training  in  the  beneficiary  communities.  The  training  will  include\nproduction of acceptable printed material, popular theater and media presentations, and holding\nfocus  group  meetings  on  sanitation,  etc.  In  addition,  training  for  staff  from  the  institutions\nconcerned (Waterboard, DOH, Urban Council, DOW, etc.) will also be implemented. The field\nsurveys  show  that  the  general  public  has  little  understanding  of  the  relationship  between\nhygiene, sanitation, and their own health.\n19. Through the CAHE program, communities will be mobilized to develop links with existing\ncommunity  groups  -  church  networks,  women's  groups,  and  other  existing  networks  -  for\nplanning and implementing the LCS-CAHE program. The LCS facilitators together with the\ncommunity development officer of the ward will plan and implement the program activities.\nCAHE will be introduced in individual households and the community before installing the toilets.\nHousehold and community contributions will mainly be in the form of labor and part of the cost\nof the materials. Through CAHE, awareness on health, sanitation, and O&M of the VIPLs will be\nundertaken. Eighty percent of the beneficiaries of the CAHE training and O&M program will be\nwomen.\n20. NGOs will support the LCS\u2013CAHE program by facilitating the selection of the LCS\nfacilitators working in the LCS/IUs. Several NGOs such as Adventist Development and Relief\nAgency  International,  Red  Cross,  Young  Women's  Christian  Association,  and  Habitat  for\nHumanity, PNG can provide the required cooperation and support.3 Any NGO participating in\nimplementing the LCS\u2013CAHE program will be engaged in accordance with competitive selection\nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  involvement  of  various  NGOs  will  facilitate  active\ncommunity participation in planning and implementing the program. The program will be linked\nwith other existing development programs in the settlements.\n2.  Linkages to the Project\n21. The ADB-financed components of the Project will provide water supply and sewerage\nservices to selected provincial towns. Provision of new or rehabilitation of the sewerage services\nunder  the  Project  will  be  limited  to  downtown  areas  in  Alotau,  Madang,  and  Mt.  Hagen.\nTherefore,  by  providing  cost-effective  low-cost  sanitation  facilities  in  urban  settlements  not\nserved by sewerage systems, the LCS-CAHE program will add substantive value to the Project\nand make it more poverty oriented. The program has specific objectives different from but highly\ncomplementary to those of the Project. Through the program, an integrated water supply and\nsanitation approach can be followed in the selected provincial towns.\n3.  Involvement of the Community and Non-Government Organizations\n22. The  program  will  mobilize  the  communities  and  develop  links  with  the  existing\ncommunity groups (particularly women's groups) by involving them in planning, design, and\nimplementation  of  LCS-CAHE  activities.  The  facilitators  (domestic  consultants)  under  the\nprogram, together with the community development officer of the urban settlement, will plan and\nimplement the program activities. Non-government organizations (NGOs) will be involved in\nimplementing the LCS-CAHE activities in several ways, e.g., identifying and possibly providing\nthe facilitators in each provincial project implementation unit (LCS/IU). Several NGOs could be\ncontracted to provide facilitators to work in the communities. The NGOs will help conduct the\nCAHE  activities  and  train  the  volunteers  and  relevant  staff  of  the  local  governments.\nInvolvement of NGOs will facilitate active community participation in planning and implementing\nLCS-CAHE activities.\n                                                \n3 At present, ADRA in Lae is involved in a VIPL sanitation program in the rural communities of Morobe Province and\nto this end is working with provincial health authority for water projects.", "44\nAppendix 4, page 6\nFigure A1: Implementation Structure\nEXECUTING AGENCY\nAsian Development Bank\nPNG Waterboard\nProject Steering Project Management\nCommittee Unit (PMU) Consultants\n-  Waterboard -  Project Director\nManaging Director\n-  Govt.

Women in particular have a primary role in collecting water, controlling its use and\nlooking after sanitation facilities. Women\u2019s preference for siting of the household VIPLs will be\ngiven priority. Knowledge about basic water and sanitation interlinks with health is poor in PNG.\nUnder the LCS-CAHE program, sanitation awareness training will be given to women. The\nprogram will benefit the community in terms of health and improved overall understanding of the\nhealthy livelihood.\n4.  Procurement, Consulting Services and Flow of Funds\n24. The Waterboard project management unit (PMU) will procure goods and services in\naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines for Procurement.  The  urban  councils  of  the  provincial\nadministrations will be responsible for design, site selection, and construction supervision jointly\nwith the appropriate local government departments and the Waterboard. The relevant town\nadministration may wish to undertake the construction of the VIPLs as a contractor to the\nWaterboard, through normal commercial contractual arrangements. Beneficiary households will\ngive their contributions (mostly labor) during the construction works. Civil works and materials\nmay  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding  or  through  community  participation  in\naccordance with procedures acceptable to ADB.\n25. Except as provided below for civil works contracts under $50,000 equivalent, civil works\nand materials supply contracts for the program in each case estimated to cost the equivalent of\n$200,000 or less may be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding among prequalified\ncontractors in accordance with the standard procurement procedures of the Government and\nacceptable to ADB. Prequalification selection and engagement of contractors shall be subject to\nthe approval of ADB. As soon as the bids received have been evaluated, the proposal for award\nof contract shall be submitted to ADB for approval. For this purpose, ADB shall be furnished\nwith three copies of (i) an account of the public opening of bids, (ii) a summary and evaluation of\nthe bids, (iii) the proposal for award, and (iv) a draft contract or a draft letter of acceptance.\nPromptly after each contract is awarded, ADB shall be furnished with three copies of the\ncontract executed. Civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or less may\ninvolve  the  participation  of  local  communities  and  may  be  awarded  in  accordance  with\nprocedures agreed between the Waterboard and the community concerned and acceptable to\nADB.\n26. The PMU will select and engage the consultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic\nconsultants  (a  summary  of  consultant's  inputs  is  in  Table  A4.4).  Implementation  will  be\nsupported  by  a  consulting  team  that  includes  one  international  consultant  (environmental\nengineer), a national coordinator (environmental engineer), a CAHE coordinator, five provincial\nteam coordinators, and the facilitators. The international consultant, the national coordinator and\nthe CAHE coordinator will be hired intermittently to provide required inputs. The consultants\nshould  have  experience  in  the  following  fields:  international  consultant,  environmental\nengineering and community health in developing countries; national coordinator, environmental\nengineering  as  well  as  management  of  community  health  projects;  LCS-CAHE  program\ncoordinator,  design  and  planning  of  health  and  sanitation  awareness  campaigns  at  the\ncommunity level; provincial team coordinator, environmental engineering and community health;\nfacilitators,  community  organizing;  NGOs  selected  for  component  implementation,  work  on\ncommunity health and community organizing. The terms of reference are in paras. 43-44.\n27. To facilitate payments under the program, a JFPR special account will be opened with a\ncommercial bank in the name of the EA (the Waterboard). An annual Work Plan and funds\nrequirement are to be established that would ascertain the amount for advance, which is limited\nto the estimated 6 months' expenditure by the EA. The Special Account will be replenished after\nthe EA liquidates at least 50% of the initial advance on the basis of a statement of expenditures", "Appendix 4, page 8\n46\n(SOE).  This  procedure  is  applicable  to  all  expenditures  of  $10,000  or  less  for  individual\npayments, otherwise, the EA is required to attach supporting documents such as invoice and\nreceipts for liquidation and replenishment purposes.\nTable A4.4: Summary of Consultants Inputs\nInternational Consultants                                       Domestic Consultants\n\u2022  Environmental (low-cost  4.0 P  ilot low-cost sanitation\n              sanitation) engineer          activities (1.5 years)\n\u2022  Accountant/Financial  0.75 \u2022  National coordinator-CAHE 4.0\nanalyst \u2022  Computer aided Design\ndraftsperson 2.0\n\u2022  LCS manager-nat.coord (HQ) 7.0\n\u2022  Team coordinator (2 towns) 36.0\n\u2022  LCS facilitators (2 towns) 54.0\nC  omprehensive LCS-CAHE\nResponse\n5.0\n      (1.5 years)\n\u2022  LCS manager-nat.coord (HQ) 3.0\n\u2022  National coordinator-CAHE 90.0\n162.0\n\u2022  Team coordinator (5 towns)\n\u2022  LCS facilitators (5 towns)\nSubtotal 4.75 363.0\n5.  Performance Monitoring Indicators\n28. A simplified and cost-effective LCS-CAHE program performance management system\n(PPMS) will be set up in the LCS/CU, and linked to the Project's PPMS through the PMU. The\nindicators will monitor both process and impacts. The process indicators will give information on\nthe  progress  and  implementation  of  CAHE  activities  (number  of  participating  households,\nnumber of households that have adopted sanitation practices and show behavioral changes)\nand LCS activities (number of households that have installed VIPLs, household contributions,\nparticipation  in  training  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)).  The  impact  indicators  will\ncomprise  data  on  changes  in  incidence  of  diseases,  public  health  expenditures,  and\nimprovements in standard of living. Benchmark surveys will collect detailed information specific\nto  the  targeted  beneficiary  communities  at  the  earliest  possible  stage  during  program\nimplementation. Data on the process and impact indicators will be collected and analyzed every\nsix months. At the end of the initial phase (18 months), an assessment report will describe\nlessons to be incorporated in the LCS-CAHE activities, which will cover more comprehensively\nthe  selected  urban  settlements  in  five  provincial  towns  during  the  second  phase.  An\nindependent NGO will carry out the assessments at the end of phase I and phase II.\n6.  Reporting and Auditing\n29. The LCS-CAHE coordinator in each provincial town will submit a biannual report on\nLCS-CAHE performance monitoring and assessment to the national coordinator at the project\nPMU. The report's contents will be included in the progress reports to be submitted quarterly to\nADB. At the end of this component implementation, performance assessment reports prepared\nby the LCS/CUs will be consolidated by the PMU and then submitted to ADB.\n30. All expenditures under the program including funds held in the JFPR special account,\nSOE transactions are subject to periodic audit by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB.", "47\nAppendix 4, page 9\nF.  Impact Assessment\n1.  Impact on Poverty\n31. Poor urban residents in the project provincial towns will benefit from access to clean and\nreliable water, and safe disposal of excreta through the upgraded existing services or the newly\nconstructed services under both the LCS-CAHE program and the Project components.\n32. About 16 percent of PNG\u2019s urban population are categorized as poor (World Bank,\n1999) and these people and the broader community residing in the five project component\ntowns stand to benefit from the Project. PNG\u2019s urban poor include squatters, the unemployed\nand underemployed, and low-income families that are often very large. The poor are most\nvulnerable because they have fewer resources they can use to change their circumstances.\nUnaffordable costs drive poor people to compromise on living standards, by resorting to such\ncommon practices as drinking unsafe water from rivers. Other options, such as purchasing\ndrinking water through vendors which is common in Asia, do not exist in PNG, largely due to the\nprohibitive transport costs to supply and distribute water. The poor cannot afford the inflated\nprices of tanker-supplied water during the dry season.\n33. The five program towns, diarrhea due to unsafe water and inadequate sanitation is\nendemic. This disease and others reduce the capacity of adults to work productively and to care\nfor other family members. Intestinal diseases are more prevalent among poorer people and the\nresulting loss of productivity has more pronounced negative economic effects on them.\n34. The LCS subprogram will remedy the situation by offering significant benefits to the\ncommunity  without  economically  burdening  the  beneficiaries  at  the  lower  end  of  the\nsocioeconomic  scale.  The  LCS-CAHE  program  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction\nstrategy as it will provide essential sanitation services to poor urban dwellers. The CAHE\nsubprogram will assist in improving the hygiene education of poorer households by raising\nawareness  of  health  and  sanitation  issues.  Health  education  will  also  benefit  households\nfinancially by providing information and ideas on water conservation and use.\n35. Community education in water supply and sanitation has been largely ignored in PNG.\nThe program will assist to address this gap by developing and implementing a package of\nactivities  to  improve  the  knowledge  of  householders  in  basic  hygiene,  safe  collecting  and\nstorage  of  water,  environmental  health,  and  O&M  of  various  toilet  systems.  The  CAHE\nsubprogram will also emphasize safe water supplies and the desirability of sanitation systems.\nThe program will adopt a holistic approach to community health and hygiene.\n36. Finally, health improvements will greatly benefit women by reducing the time they need\nto look after the sick, particularly small children. Women stand to benefit significantly in the\neducation on water use, hygiene practices, and other CAHE activities. The information will give\nthem control and choice in the way they care for their families and manage resources of water\nand money. It will give women opportunities to make decisions about issues that affect their\ndaily lives and enable them to actively contribute to the economic development of the family.\n2.  Sustainable Poverty Reduction Impact\n37. At the macro level of the component will have a structural impact on poverty. First,\ncompared with other nonaffordable options (sewerage, septic tanks), the proposed low-cost\nsanitation facilities (VIPLs) are the most cost-effective solution to the existing public health\nproblem and are a viable alternative from an economic viewpoint as scarce project resources\nwill be used efficiently for the benefit of the poor. Second, and more importantly, the LCS-CAHE\nprogram will directly contribute to better public health. The benefits, in terms of savings of", "48\nAppendix 4, page 10\nprivate  and  public  health  expenditures  and  direct  opportunity  costs,  will  disproportionately\nbenefit the urban poor through higher labor productivity and increased real income at the\nhousehold level. Annual public health expenditures in the provinces are estimated at K15 per\nperson4 and a major share is for treating waterborne diseases. Although undocumented to date,\naverage health expenditures may be significantly higher in the targeted urban settlements in the\nfive program provincial towns. As targeted LCS-CAHE program beneficiaries are about 36,000\npeople, a reduction in public health expenditures by 20 percent would result in around K100,000\nresource cost savings annually.\n38. Beneficiary ownership is critical to a sustainable outcome of the proposed component.\nDirect  community  involvement,  participation,  and  sense  of  ownership  have  been  secured\nthrough agreed-upon cost sharing with the beneficiary households. The field visits during project\npreparation have confirmed that the targeted beneficiary households are willing to share about\n5-10 percent in the construction costs through labor and in-kind contribution.\n39. Sustainable provision of low-cost sanitation services also requires regular maintenance\nof the VIPLs. Training for the beneficiaries will be part of the CAHE subprogram. The beneficiary\ncommunities, particularly the women, will be responsible for maintaining the LCS facilities.\n40. From a gender perspective it is expected that the targeting of women and their close\ninvolvement will contribute considerably to sustainable project outcomes.\n3.  Participatory Development Issues\n41. Because of higher population density and as a result of poor sanitary practices, the\nurban and peri-urban poor in the proposed Project's provincial towns are more directly exposed\nto health risks than are the rural communities. Public resources to address the sanitation\nproblems  of  the  urban  poor  are  not  available  and  public  interventions  alone  will  not  be\nsustainable. Durable solutions to public health issues due to poor sanitary conditions require an\ninnovative approach and a new strategy through a participatory process. Therefore, building a\nGovernment-community partnership and close involvement of the beneficiary communities in all\nLCS-CAHE activities is critical.\n42. During the project preparatory fieldwork, civil society groups (church networks, women's\ngroups, local NGOs, neighborhood associations) that were consulted expressed willingness to\nbe  involved  in  the  implementation  process.  The  proposed  program  will  be  a  model  of\npartnership building involving the provincial government, urban authorities, and a variety of\ncommunity based organizations.\nG. Risks and Assurances\n43. Two major risks have been identified. First, the provincial governments and the urban\nauthorities  of  the  respective  provincial  towns  may  lack  the  capabilities  to  implement  the\nprogram. This risk will be minimized by establishing LCS/CU and LCS/IU in each selected\nprovincial town. Both units will be assisted and guided by consultants. Second, there may be no\ncommunity demand for low-cost sanitation facilities. This risk is minimized in the project design\nthrough the implementation of the associated CAHE subprogram. Field investigation at the\nproject  design  stage  has  confirmed  that  poor  and  low-income  households  are  willing  to\ncontribute, demonstrating their interest and motivation to participate. The Government and the\nWaterboard have given the following assurances:\n                                                \n4 UNDP. 1998. PNG Human Development Report.", "49\nAppendix 4, page 11\n44.

Operations and Maintenance (O&M). The Government will ensure that a memorandum\nof understanding will be executed between the Waterboard and each participating province and\nlocal government, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, which will describe in detail the\nrequired contributions to capital cost and O&M, as well as contributions in-kind or in cash, from\nthe beneficiaries of the LCS facilities, including arrangement for inspection of such LCS facilities\nat least once every six months after completion.\n47. Environment.  The  Government  and  the  Waterboard  will  ensure  that  adequate\nenvironmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  will  be  followed  in  the  design  and\nimplementation of the proposed low-cost sanitation program and that (i) design and construction\nof each toilet will adhere to specific environmental guidelines; and (ii) samples from shallow\ngroundwater  sources  surrounding  particular  toilets  will  be  tested  in  accordance  with  the\nenvironmental monitoring and mitigation program.\n48. Gender. The Government will ensure that women will comprise (i) at least 50 percent of\nthe community representatives who are members of each LCS/CU; and (ii) at least 80 percent\nof the participants for training and at least 50 percent of the facilitators engaged under the LCS-\nCAHE program.\n49. Performance  Monitoring:  Within  12  months  of  commencement  of  the  program,  a\nsimplified LCS-CAHE programs performance management system with indicators to monitor\nprogram progress and inputs will be set up. Such data will be collected every six months and an\nassessment report will be provided at the end of 18 months after commencement of the LCS-\nCAHE program.", "50\nAppendix 4, page 12\nH.  Conditions for Disbursement\n50. No withdrawals shall be made from the relevant account of any JFPR grant proceeds for\nthe LCS-CAHE program until: (I) a memorandum of understanding shall have been executed\nbetween the Waterboard and the participating provincial and local level government concerned\non terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank; and (ii) the LCS/CU and LCS/IU in the\nparticipating province concerned shall have been established in a manner satisfactory to the\nBank.\nI.

Introduction\n1. The  proposed  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B  as  per  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank's  (ADB)  guidelines  for  environmental  assessment  of  project  impacts.\nConsequently, consultants for each subproject carried out an initial environmental examination\n(IEE) as part of the project preparatory technical assistance for this Project. The IEE examined\nthe  likely  environmental  impacts  and  consequences  of  implementing  the  water  supply,\nsewerage and sewage treatment activities as identified in each project town.\n  2. The Project aims at (I) increased coverage and improved delivery of basic water and\nsanitation  services  by  developing  affordable  and  sustainable  water  supply,  sewerage,  and\nsanitation schemes in selected priority towns; (ii) improved management and coordination of the\nwater supply and sanitation sector through sector policy reform, institutional strengthening, and\ncapacity building for the Waterboard; and (iii) improved health and poverty reduction for poor\nhouseholds  and  other  urban  residents  through  the  provision  of  affordable  water  supply,\nsewerage, and sanitation services.\nB.  Description of the Project\n3. The  Project  will  provide  water  supplies  (new  or  upgraded  existing  systems  and\nexpanded coverage) to selected provincial towns and piped sewerage and sewage treatment\n(new or upgraded existing systems) to selected towns.\nC.  Description of the Environment\n4. Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a tropical country, generally hot and humid with varied\nclimates in the different regions. There are three highland project towns (Mt. Hagen, Mendi, and\nWabag) and five coastal towns (Alotau, Kerema, Lae, Madang, and Wewak). The coastal areas\nhave equatorial climates and the northern towns (Alotau, etc) suffer from the same cyclone\nseason as Northern Australia. Temperatures range from 23o to 32o C. Rainfall is of the order of\n2,200 to 2,500 millimeters per year. In the highlands, Mendi is 1,700 meters above sea level\n(asl). Mt. Hagen is at 1,500-2,100 masl with peaks of 4,100 m and has a typical tropical\nhighlands climate regime. Temperatures range from 12o to 24o C. Rainfall averages 2,500 to\n3,000 mm per year.\n5. PNG has a wealth of fauna and flora which are considered some of the most diverse and\nunique in the world. The project components are in urban areas surrounded by rural areas\ndominated by low-density population and subsistence livelihood activities. There are no known\nspecies of endangered fauna or flora or sites of archaeological significance in the immediate\nvicinity. The Project will not have any negative impact.\n1.  Human and Economic Development\n6. The most recent population census was in 1990; the next census is due in 2001. The\nestimated population of PNG is 4.6 million, most of whom live a subsistence lifestyle. Most of\nthe larger populations live in coastal towns, and population density in both the coastal towns\nand the highlands is low. Many towns are former government administration centers, and have\nbecome provincial administration centers after decentralization. Many towns have 500-1,000\nhouseholds.  A  semi-subsistence  lifestyle  provides  livelihood  for  over  85  percent  of  the", "64\nAppendix 9, page 2\npopulation. Urbanization is a recent phenomenon in PNG. The 1971 census, had only three\ntowns with more than 20,000 people. In 1980, the urban population was 13 percent. Projections\nof the 1990 census estimate that the urban population will rise to 25 percent between 2010 and\n2020. The population of PNG is very youthful; surveys show 47 percent of the population are\nbelow the age of 15.\n7. The project towns are urban in a broad sense. People from many parts of the country\nand migrants from rural areas from the same province coverage in most urban centers, all\nexpecting to find gainful employment. Strong provincialism at the urban and peri-urban levels\nresults in the concentration of clans and the general intolerance for \u201coutsiders.\u201d\n8. The per capita gross domestic product is $1,266. A survey of 979 households\u2019 income\nshowed that in most of the project towns, the median income was K667 per month (equivalent\nto $266.8). Significantly, the bottom 10 percent had an income of less than K292 per month\n(equivalent to $116.8), and the top 10 percent had an income five times that of the lowest 10\npercent.\n9. Discrete central business areas occur in the larger towns and are evident even in the\nsmaller  towns.  Water  and  sanitation  services  for  these  areas  are,  however,  generally\ninadequate. Residential areas of towns vary with the socioeconomic status of residents. In most\ntowns, \u201csettlements\u201d occupied by squatter communities are interspersed among the residential\nareas. Environmental services are generally very poor for those settlements. The peri-urban\nareas  usually  consist  of  markets,  workshops,  institutional  establishments,  and  low-density,\nsemirural subsistence communities. Basic services including water and sanitation in these areas\nare usually very poor.\n2.  Quality of Life Values\n10. Housing surveys showed that more than 65 percent of households in the towns live in\nlow-standard housing with 25 percent living in makeshift or bush material housing. The average\nhousehold  size  is  8.2  persons;  households  of  medium-  or  high-cost  housing  have  fewer\nmembers per household. There is no official poverty line in PNG. A consumption-based poverty\nassessment by the World Bank in 1996 suggests that about 37 percent live below the poverty\nline. The United Nations Development Program in 1999 reported that the Human Poverty Index\nfor PNG is one of the worst in the world. The project towns are small, with populations ranging\nfrom 4,200 in Kerema to 9,400 in Alotau, 24,400 in Mt.Hagen and 26,600 in Wewak. Lae is\nunusually large with 130,000.\n11. Low life expectancy, high infant mortality rate, poor adult literacy rate, and low school\nenrollment all combine to make PNG\u2019s human development level one of the lowest in ADB\u2019s\ndeveloping member countries. Health indicators are very poor and show a high incidence of\nwaterborne  diseases  (Malaria,  typhoid)  and  preventable  intestinal  diseases  (diarrhea,\ndysentery). The latter are directly attributable to poor sanitation conditions, poor hygiene, and\nunsafe drinking water combined with the public's lack of understanding of the general principles\nof hygiene and sanitation. In the \u201csettlement\u201d areas in the towns, environmental conditions are\ngenerally worse than in other parts, because of lack of safe water and sanitation, which lowers\nthe quality of life.\n12. Highland towns have many settlements in steep-sided gullies that often experience\nlandslides and mudflows. Rainwater is often the preferred drinking water source when available", "65\nAppendix 9, page 3\nin most towns. However, supplies do not last all year, and most people resort to water vendors\nfor supplies, that are often unsafe.\n13. Most towns have, to a greater or lesser degree, problems with personal and property\nsecurity. Vandalism is another common social problem in most towns.\nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n14. Table  A9.1  and  A9.2  give  an  overview  of  the  proposed  works  and  the  physical\ninterventions.\nTable A9.1: The Water Supply Component\nTown Source Proposed Works Physical Interventions\nKerema Groundwater New water supplies Chlorinated water distributed by gravity\nfrom an elevated reservoir\nMendi Two options- surface and New supplies Weir,  water  treatment  plant  (WTP),\ngroundwater chlorinated  water  to  reservoir,  gravity\nsupply to town\nWabag Surface Upgrade  existing  works, Upgrade  the  existing  intake,  refurbish\nextend delivery network existing  WTP,  extend  reticulation,  new\nmetering\nTable A9.2: The Sewerage Component\nTown Proposed Works Physical Interventions\nAlotau Sewerage for new part of town or a combination of old Sewerage  for  the  business  area,  or\nand new business and residential area; modular\nsewage treatment plant (STP); outfall to\nsea\nMadang New  rising  main  to  deliver  to  the  existing  sewage New pumping station plus connection of\nponds the two existing stations to a new rising\nmain  that  will  deliver  the  combined\nsewage to the existing sewage ponds\nMt. Upgrade the existing treatment plant Convert  existing  first  sewage  pond  to\nHagen aerated lagoon; add wetlands for further\noxygenation,  and  a  disinfection  unit\nbefore effluent discharge point\n1.  Construction of Water Supply and Sewerage Facilities\na.  Project Location\n15. Water supplies are proposed in Kerema, Mendi and Wabag. Work for the first two entail\nnew supplies and distribution, works for Wabag entail upgrading the existing treatment plant and\nextending the delivery network. The output will be safe supplies of chlorinated water. Land\nrequirements were carefully assessed, and the subprojects will be located on lands that are\nunlikely to be contested. Mendi will abstract 3,400 cubic metres (m3) of raw water per day from\nthe Mangani River. This abstraction is not expected to cause significant negative changes to the\nriver regime. Wabag will use the existing Pagwa creek intake after upgrading it. The intake is\nexpected to provide 168 liters per second (l/s) and the abstraction is assessed to cause no\nsignificant  change  to  the  river  regime.  Kerema's  water  supply  is  aimed  at  providing  1.5\nmegaliters per day (Ml/d) now and 1.7 Ml/d in 2020, with a suitable number of boreholes. The\ntypical borehole depths in Kerema are 50-100 m. It is claimed that abstracting these quantities", "66\nAppendix 9, page 4\nof water from aquifers this deep will have no significant effects on the shallow groundwater in\nopen wells. A plan for minimal monitoring of the boreholes themselves and some open wells\nmust be prepared to confirm that this is the case.\n16. Sewerage services will be provided for Alotau, Madang, and Mt. Hagen to ultimately\nhave 24-hour service. Alotau will have sewerage and a new, modular sewage treatment plant.\nMadang and Mt. Hagen will use the existing sewage ponds after these facilities are upgraded to\nensure adequate treatment. Madang will have a package sewage treatment plant and the\neffluent will be discharged by sea outfall. The Department of Environment permit is mandatory\nand  will  ensure  that  standards  are  adequate  for  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  and  total\nsuspended solids. Sludge will be discharged to sludge ponds for treatment. Alotau will have a\npackage plant to treat up to 184 kiloleters per day (Kl/d), and the effluent will be disposed of by\nsea outfall to discharge no less than 200 m past low water, which is considered sufficient to\nensure that no coral reefs or mangroves are affected. Mt. Hagen\u2019s design figures are a total of\n2,475 Kl/d. Treatment is in concrete-lined sewage ponds and final polishing of the effluent is by\nwetlands. The effluent will be disposed of by outfall to the river, and chlorination prior to\ndischarge is recommended. Sludge will be taken from the aeration ponds for treatment in the\nfacultative ponds, where it will be rendered harmless. In Madang, the flow from the hospital is\n31 l/s and the others combined is 72 l/s. Sewage from the hospital is only toilet waste and\ntherefore does not contain any intractable waste material.\nb.  Design Aspects\n17. The water supply component will provide clean and safe water for, ultimately, 24-hour\nsupplies.  Design  considerations  will  ensure  that  abstraction  (ground  water  or  surface),\ntreatment, and distribution through trunk mains and networks to the delivery points will be\naffordable to the target populations and water delivered at the point of consumption will be safe.\nSewerage services will be provided to ensure adequate treatment of sewage so that the effluent\nwill not cause environmental damage primarily to receiving waters. The new sewage treatment\nplant in Alotau will conform to effluent standards. The upgrading in Mt. Hagen and Madang will\nensure that the resulting effluent conforms to appropriate standards. The final and safe disposal\nof sludge will be addressed during the design phase. Sewerage works are designed for a time\nhorizon to year 2020. The law requires all sewerage interventions to obtain approval from the\nOffice of Environment. Before a license is given, the treatment details must be presented and\nthe quality of effluent and its disposal and disposal of sludge will have to comply with the PNG\nnational standards. Effluent and sludge disposal was examined for the towns concerned. At the\ndetailed  design  stage,  the  consultants  will  be  required  to  provide  design,  monitoring  and\nmitigation safeguards to ensure compliance with PNG's national environmental standards.\nc.  Construction Stage\n18. No significant or unusual environmental problems are envisioned during the construction\nstage. Excavation for pipelines and backfilling of the trenches will involve some disruption to\nnormal traffic flows (both vehicular and pedestrian), and may cause some soil to be washed off\nthe sites. However, this problem is estimated to be minor and can be further minimized by\nscheduling construction during the dry season and adequate monitoring. However, as land\nownership and access to it are vexing questions in PNG, adequate care will be taken during\nconstruction to ensure minimum levels of problems arising from land disputes.", "67\nAppendix 9, page 5\nd.  Operations Stage\n19. Adequate water testing at the treatment works, at points along the distribution system\nand at sample points of delivery, will be undertaken to ensure that standards for delivering safe\nwater  are  maintained.  As  maintenance  of  project  facilities  is  crucial  to  their  longevity  and\nsustainability,  the  operational  and  maintenance  (O&M)  capacity  building  program  will  train\nWaterboard staff. Adequate effluent testing will be undertaken at entry points to treatment works\nand the effluent discharge points to ensure that the sewage entering the works and the effluent\nbeing discharged into receiving waters comply with the design standards.\n20. The  Project  aims  to  strengthen  the  environmental  monitoring  capacity  of  the  PNG\nWaterboard, both institutionally and physically by providing adequate laboratory facilities and\ntraining technologists in routine monitoring functions. This will ensure that problems arising will\nbe dealt with to safeguard the environment.\ne.  Critical Overall Environmental Review\n21. In the short term, during the design, construction, and operation of the project facilities, it\nis anticipated that environmental impacts will be minor and can readily be managed with proper\nplanning, and adequate mitigation measures together with regular monitoring.\n22. For  the  much  longer  term,  project  facilities  will  significantly  improve  the  personal,\nhousehold, and community hygiene; and health and environmental sanitation. The enhanced\nquality of life can lead to poverty reduction in the target communities.\nE.  Environmental Monitoring and Institutional Requirement\n23. The  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  together  with  the  consultants  ensure  that\nenvironmental monitoring programs are designed for the Waterboard generally and incorporated\nin  the  civil  construction  contracts  with  specific  mitigation  measures.  The  provincial  town\nimplementing unit will ensure that the contractors comply with the mitigation measures required.\nRegular monitoring of the actual environmental impacts and conditions during implementation\nwill be carried out as part of the new responsibilities of the Waterboard, and ultimately delegated\nto  the  provincial/district  offices.  Tables  A9.3  will  serve  as  a  guideline.  To  strengthen  the\npresently weak environmental management capacity of the Waterboard, senior and operational\nstaff  will  be  trained  in  environmental  awareness,  especially  of  their  own  projects,  and  in\nenvironmental assessments and ways to mitigate adverse impacts. This will ensure that the\nWaterboard will play its role as an environmentally responsible corporate citizen. Additionally,\nsenior staff from the Office and the Department of the Environment, Department of Health, etc.\nwill be included in the training program.\nF.  Findings and Recommendations\n24. The  Project  will  bestow  long-lasting  and  significant  improvements  in  personal,\nhousehold, and community health and well-being, thereby improving the quality of life for the\ntarget populations in the project towns. It will also reduce poverty. The Project as is conceived\nand prepared is recommended for implementation.", "68\nAppendix 9, page 6\nG.  Conclusions\n25. The Project will have no significant adverse environmental impact. On the contrary, it will\nresult  in  significant,  widespread,  and  long-lasting  environmental  improvements.  A  full\nenvironmental impact assessment is not necessary.\nTable A9.3: Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation/Protection Measures\nProblems Arising Impacts Mitigation/Protection Post Mitigation\nMeasures Environmental Effect\nA.

Introduction\n1. Papua New Guinea (PNG) in the western Pacific comprises the eastern portion of the\nisland of New Guinea and about 300 small islands to the north and east. It is dominated by\nmountain ranges subject to earthquakes and volcanic activity. PNG has a population of 4.4\nmillion  about  85  percent  of  whom  reside  in  the  rural  areas.  The  people  speak  over  800\nlanguages. The country is rich in mineral resources, including copper and gold. The main\neconomic activity is mining and minerals account for most exports. The country's energy is from\nnatural gas, oil and hydroelectric power. Agricultural activity tends to be either subsistence\nfarming or intensive production of coffee, tea, cocoa, and copra for export. Important fisheries\nand forestry exports include prawns, tuna, palm oil, logs, and lumber. Because of the islands\u2019\nmountainous and swampy terrain, transportation is mainly by air.\nB. Stakeholder Features\n2. The Project is expected to contribute to human development and economic growth, and\nthus help to reduce poverty in the project towns. The profile of the stakeholders is based on the\nsocioeconomic  surveys  carried  out  during  project  preparation  for  the  technical  assistance,\nreview of available data and statistics, and discussions with Waterboard personnel, and central\nand provincial government organizations. The table gives the population of the project towns,\nand the estimated number and percentage of people within the areas to be served by the water\nsupply and sanitation subprojects.\nTable A10: Populations and Estimated Service Coverage in Project Towns\nTown Urban Service Area Population\nPopulation a\nno b Percent\nWater Supply\nKerema 4,900   4,900 100\nMendi 12,100 12,100 100\nWabag 3,700   3,700 100\nSewerage\nAlotau 17,100    6,300c na\nMadang 60,500   3,500 6\nMt.

The  household  survey  during  project  preparation  indicates  that  47  percent  of  the\npopulation are below the age of 16. Males outnumber females 112:100 in all age groups in the\n1990 census of the urban population, and in the 15\u201324 years age group the ratio is 122:100.\nUrban  centers  typically  have  a  much  higher  male-female  ratio  than  the  rural  areas  (126\ncompared with 109).\n4. Household Size. The average household has around 8.2 persons.\n5. Poverty.  There  is  no  poverty  line  in  PNG.    Using  data  collected  from  the  1996\ndemographic and health survey of 1,200 households, the World Bank (1999) calculated a", "71\nAppendix 10, page 2\npoverty line based on consumption of 2,200 calories per day together with nonfood essentials to\nreach an overall upper poverty line of K461 per adult equivalent per year.  The report further\nsuggested that some 16 percent of the urban population lived below this upper poverty line in\n1996.  The household surveys for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) study confirmed that the\nbottom 10 percent of the population has an income of less than K292.50 per month.  The top 10\npercent of households has an income more than five times that of the lowest percentile.\n6. Health. Infant mortality rate is 73 per 1,000 live births while maternal mortality rate is\n0.37 per 1,000 live births. Life expectancy is 54.6 years for men and 53.3 years for women. One\nhealth extension worker serves every 16,800 people and one nurse per 1,400 people. The five\nleading causes of national mortality for 1995-1999 were predominantly diseases exacerbated by\npoor living conditions: pneumonia, malaria, prenatal conditions, tuberculosis, and meningitis.\nDiarrhea and typhoid also ranked high as leading causes of death. The health indicators for\nPNG  show  a  high  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  particularly  diarrhea  and  typhoid,  a\nsituation that was confirmed by the household survey and the review of data for each town.\n7. Education. Education levels are low and so are the literacy rates. Literacy rate is 40\npercent for women and 50 percent for men.  Enrollment rate is 90.5 percent for elementary\ngrades 1-2, 55.8 percent for primary (grades 3-9), 9.2 percent for secondary (grades 10-12),\nand only 0.4 percent for tertiary or higher education.\n8. Employment. All towns show high levels of unemployment and/or under-employment.\n9. Housing and Tenure. More than 26 percent of all households surveyed live in makeshift\nor bush materials housing, and more than 65 percent live in low-cost, low-standard housing.\nThe majority (54.9 percent) of urban residents do not own the house they live in.\n C. Infrastructure Needs\n10. Water.  Information  from  household  surveys  suggests  that  21.6  percent  of  the\nhouseholds overall do not have enough water, and at least 31 percent do not have water\navailable year-round. Households in the towns that rely predominantly on rainwater are very\nvulnerable to shortages during the dry season, and prolonged lack of water during droughts.\nFor these households a regular and reliable reticulated water supply is most important.  In towns\nwhere reticulated water supply is available, the level of access varies significantly between the\nricher and poorer households. In Mt. Hagen it appears that 75 percent of the households\nsurveyed have access to a reticulated supply. However, the poor are less likely to be connected\nand  are  more  likely  to  rely  on  unsafe  water  sources.  While  86.7  percent  of  the  wealthy\nhouseholds are connected, only 50.9 percent of the poorer households are. The results are\nsimilar for Lae, the other large town.\n11. Sewerage.  The  main  types  of  sanitation  units  in  urban  areas  are  flush  toilets\n(waterborne sewerage and septic) and pit latrines, with bucket disposal systems still operating\nin some towns. The household survey shows that about 41 percent of households are using\nflush toilets and 41 percent are using pit latrines. Almost 8 percent of households have no toilet\nand members defecate in the sea, bush, or mangrove areas. Towns such as Kerema, Wabag,\nand parts of Madang rely on the unsatisfactory bucket collection system.\nD. Service Demands\n12. Household  surveys  show  that  a  reliable  reticulated  water  supply  and  sanitation\nimprovements are top priorities of households in all towns. There is also a significant awareness\namong  households  of  the  benefits  from  improved  urban  environment  and  infrastructure.\nWillingness to pay, however, is quoted at less than the amount households are actually paying", "72\nAppendix 10, page 3\nat present. A more fair and less subjective test of the willingness to pay for urban services could\nbe based on the amounts the households are actually paying at the time of the survey, e.g., K6-\nK10 per month for bucket collection, and K10\u2013K15 per month for piped water supply. During the\ndry season, untreated water is purchased at prices far in excess of the town water tariffs.\n \nE. Impact on the Communities\n13. Improved quantity and quality of water supply will improve the health and well-being of\nthe project beneficiaries. Beneficiaries who presently spend considerable time fetching water for\nhousehold use, can more productively spend time on income-generating and/or subsistence\nactivities.\n14. The LCS-CAHE program (JFPR) will undertake a comprehensive community awareness\nand health education program to raise the communities' appreciation and knowledge of public\nhealth and hygiene and the linkages between water supply and improved sanitation. The LCS-\nCAHE program, in particular, will involve community mobilization, participatory planning with the\ncommunities,  non-government  organizations  and  the  provincial  town  administrations.\nCommunity involvement will help maximize the social impacts of the proposed project. Since\nLCS will be provided to low-income and poor people, the households contribution will be in the\nform of labor and partial cost of the ventilated improved pit latrine (VIPL) materials.\n F. Impact on the Poor\n15. The  Project  will  address  the  needs  of  the  poorer  members  of  the  communities,\nespecially those who currently have little access to safe water and therefore suffer higher than\naverage incidences of waterborne diseases. The recent Waterboard decision to introduce a\nlifeline tariff of 12 kl at a fixed (discounted) rate of K3.50 and to remove the direct charge for\nwater connections removed the substantial impediments of connection fees and high water\ncharges for the poorer sections of the community.\n16. Construction works under the Project will require labor and will generate direct income-\nearning opportunities for the poor. Moreover, by stimulating economic growth and attracting\ninvestments  to  the  project  towns,  improved  infrastructure  will  indirectly  create  employment\nopportunities.\n17. In addition, the LCS-CAHE program (JFPR) will directly target the poorer sections of the\ncommunity with information designed to assist them in making informed choices on sanitation\noptions.  In  parallel  the  LCS  program  will  offer  affordable,  technically  appropriate  on-site\nsanitation facilities for the poorer urban households. The improved hygiene and sanitation\nresulting  from  the  Project  will  lead  to  improved  health,  greater  productivity,  and  reduced\nexpenses on medical treatment.\n G. Gender Impact\n18. Although the water supply and sanitation components are not specifically targeted at\nwomen, the Project will improve their living conditions by providing easier and more affordable\naccess to potable water and improved sanitation. Women and children are particularly affected\nby poor living conditions arising from inadequate supplies of water and poor sanitation. Women\nexposed to unsanitary conditions in the domestic environment while managing the household,\nexhibit higher incidence of disease. Children exposed to standing and contaminated waters in\ntheir immediate environment are highly vulnerable to waterborne and vectorborne diseases.", "73\nAppendix 10, page 4\n19. Activities under the parallel LCS-CAHE program will make women and children less\nvulnerable to disease and will enhance their health, education, and productivity. The LCS\nactivities  will  be  designed  to  ensure  that  women  play  a  key  decision  role,  increase  their\nawareness of environmental sanitation issues and maximize their commitment to the O&M of\nthe  household  water  supply  and  sanitation  requirements.  To  this  end,  the  implementation\narrangements for the LCS-CAHE program have centered on women and their potential role. For\ninstance, at least 50 percent of the provincial town facilitators will be women.\n \nH. Potential Adverse Impact\n20. The  project  design  incorporates  an  appropriate  degree  of  training  and  awareness\nbuilding to allow early identification of adverse social impacts. This will ensure that such adverse\nimpacts  are  properly  dealt  with  do  not  hinder  the  goal  of  achieving  a  highly  viable  and\nsustainable project. Institutional impacts could occur where project demands cannot be met\nbecause of the influence of traditional attitudes and social norms toward the poorer and more\nvulnerable groups in the community. This would artificially reduce or constrain the absorptive\ncapacities of the Waterboard and the local agencies to effectively implement the Project. The\nProject contains significant capacity-building which, while focusing on the more traditional areas,\nwill also enhance the role of women in development. With a view to changing attitudes, the\nProject will encourage the Waterboard and its agencies to interact more with the poorer and\nmore vulnerable groups in the community.\n21. The tariff structure adopted will be important to the poorer and more vulnerable groups, if\nthey are to gain access to the services. The tariffs required for the water supply sub-projects will\nrange between 5.2 percent and 9.2 percent of the monthly household income. Under the PNG\nWaterboard\u2019s new tariffs, low-volume, poor customers will pay only K3.50 for the first 12 kl of\nwater consumed. For the sewerage subprojects, the tariffs established for cost recovery are\nrelatively high but can be reduced by contribution or subsidy from the provincial and local\ngovernments, if necessary.\nI. Monitoring and Evaluation\n22. An outline of the project's monitoring methodology by component is given in the project\nframework (Appendix 1) and the detailed methodology and approach are in Supplementary\nAppendix E. Similarly, monitoring and evaluation arrangements for the LCS-CAHE program are\nincluded in Appendix 4. A detailed benefit and monitoring manual will be prepared. It will contain\nproject monitoring and evaluation frameworks for each component and details on the objectives,\nevaluation criteria and achievement indicators. The manual and its associated procedures will\npermit  a  quantifiable  and  logical  assessment  of  outcomes  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nrequirements. The procedures and indicators will measure the positive changes to the urban\nenvironment, such as improved health, and number and type of beneficiaries serviced by the\nnew utilities and services.", "74\nAppendix 11, page 1\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND WATERBOARD FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS\nA.  General\n1.  For the water supply and sewerage subproject components chosen and evaluated under\nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) -funded TA 3173-PNG1 and subsequently reviewed and\nupdated  during  appraisal,  financial  internal  rates  of  returns  (FIRRs)  were  calculated  in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Preparation and Presentation of Financial Analysis of\nProjects. A summary of the financial analysis, affordability of tariffs, together with a summary of\nthe financial projections of the Waterboard for the next 15 years are presented. International\ninflation is assumed to be 2.4 percent per annum. The exchange rate is assumed to be K1 =\n$0.4. Domestic inflation is assumed to be 15 percent for 2000 and 5.0 percent thereafter. The\ndetailed calculation for each subproject is in Supplementary Appendix G.\nB. Financial Analysis\n2.  In accordance with the recommended investment criteria of the Waterboard, proposed\nsubproject tariffs were set to achieve cost recovery so that no long-term subsidies are required.\nExpenditures include full operation and maintenance of the facilities including administration\ncosts  in  the  districts,  full  depreciation  on  assets,  interest  payable  on  the  ADB  loan,  and\nincremental head office costs. Tariffs are assumed to be introduced as soon as the facility\noperates and to remain constant in real terms. Revenues are based on the demand assessment\nundertaken as part of the project preparatory technical assistance and the proposed average\ntariff. The net revenue (profit/loss) is calculated for each year. Since the number of connections\nand volume consumed are assumed to rise over time while tariffs remain constant, the annual\nreturn on the total initial investment will rise. The proposed tariffs are calculated on the basis\nthat,  in  the  medium  to  long  term,  each  subproject  will  also  yield  a  small  return  on  initial\ninvestment. All figures and calculations are in constant June 2000 prices. All components are\nassumed to have a life of 25 years. The analysis is undertaken for 20 years from the start of\noperations, and thus no residual value is included.\n3.  Current tariffs for water and sewerage are structured by user type - domestic/non-\ndomestic - and by volume. Based on the volumes sold by category block for February and\nMarch 2000, the average tariff of water services for C category towns is K1.08, ranging from\nK0.81 for domestic users and K1.46 for nondomestic. For the first five months of 2000, the\naverage  sewerage  tariff  was  K0.39,  ranging  from  K0.20  for  domestic  and  K0.44  for  non-\ndomestic.\n4.  The recommended tariff for financial viability was calculated on an average kiloleter\nbasis. A tariff that remains constant in real terms (increases in line with inflation) is more\npractical and easier to implement. It is also more appropriate in terms of affordability (paras. 9-\n13). Summary results of required tariffs, and the proportionate increase on current tariffs, for\nsystem  operation  (3-5  years)  for  each  subproject  are  shown  in  Table  A11.1.  A  detailed\nbreakdown of the calculation and the yearly profit/loss to 2010 is shown in Supplementary\nAppendix G. The average tariff required for financial viability varies across towns. This reflects\nthe fact that the number of connections, water sales, and the capital cost of the subproject are\nnot directly related to the volume of water produced. Generally the smaller the system, the\nhigher the cost per kiloleter consumed. Capital cost estimates are based on preliminary design\n                                                \n1 TA 3173-PNG: Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation, for $908,000, approved on 23 March 1999.", "75\nAppendix 11, page 2\nand incorporate the design of the system, number of pumps, storage, treatment, length of pipe\nrequired among topographic, geographic, and other technical considerations.\n5.  An  investment  appraisal  for  each  subproject  was  undertaken  using  methods  that\nconsider the time value of a flow of expenditure and income. The net present value (NPV) is the\npresent-day value of the income and expenditure stream discounted at the weighted average\ncost of capital (WACC). The FIRR is the discount rate at which the NPV equals zero. The\naverage incremental financial revenue (AIFR) and average incremental financial cost (AIFC) is\nthe NPV of the revenue (cost) stream discounted at the WACC divided by the NPV of the\nvolume of water sold (or sewerage treated), giving the per unit revenue (cost). Where the NPV\nis  greater  than  zero,  the  FIRR  exceeds  the  WACC,  or  the  AIFR  exceeds  the  AIFC,  the\ninvestment is financially viable.\nTable A11.1: Required Tariffs for Financial Sustainability\nSubproject Current Average Required Average Increase (percent)\nTariff (K/kl) Tariff (K/kl)\nWater Supplya\nKerema 1.08 1.6   48\nMendi 1.08 2.5 130\nWabag 1.08 2.7 150\nSewerageb\nAlotaua 0.44 2.5 468\nMt Hagenb 0.37 0.8 116\nMadang 0.39 1.3 233\na The required tariff for Alotau is very high due to the low number of connections (32). A flow volume of 100 kiloleters\nper connection/month is used, based on water volumes for the central business district area. Current average tariff\nis K0.44/kl, since all users are non-domestic.\nb For Mt. Hagen the average current tariff is K0.37/kl.\n6.  The  WACC  is  calculated  at  negative  0.6  percent  for  water  supply  subprojects  and\nnegative  0.8  percent  for  sewerage  subprojects.  Table  A11.2  shows  the  calculation  of  the\nWACC, which is negative given the low ADB borrowing rate and an average domestic inflation\nrate of 5 percent.\nTable A11.2: Weighted Average Cost of Capital (%)\nSource Amount Interest Rate Inflation WACC\nRate1\nWater Supply\nADB, ADF loan 67 1.5 5.0 -3.3\nPNG Government equity 33 5.0 0.0 5.0\n      WACC -0.6\nSewerage\nADB, ADF loan 70 1.5 5.0 -3.3\nPNG Government equity 30 5.0 0.0 5.0\n       WACC -0.8\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund\nPNG = Papua New Guinea, WACC = weighted average capital cost\n1   The ADB loan is discounted at domestic inflation since the PNG Government, not the Waterboard, will assume the\nFX risk. The real return on equity is assumed to be 5 percent; grant-funded portion is discounted at domestic\ninflation. Tax does not apply since the Waterboard is tax exempt.", "76\nAppendix 11, page 3\n7.  Table A11.3 summarizes the results of the analysis and sensitivity tests. The base case\nFIRRs exceed the WACC for all subprojects. Sensitivity tests show that the subprojects remain\nviable under assumptions of adverse cost, revenue and exchange rate.\n8.  For all subprojects the AIFR likewise exceeds the AIFC, demonstrating that at the\nchosen tariff level, the average revenue gained from producing each unit is greater than the\naverage cost. The analysis indicates that each subproject will realize positive returns. Since\nNPVs are positive, the FIRR exceeds the WACC, and the AIFR exceeds the AIFC, each\nsubproject  appears  financially  viable.  Detailed  calculations  are  found  in  Supplementary\nAppendix I.\nC. Affordability\n9.  Affordability is critical to (i) ensure that the poverty reduction policy objective of ADB is\nmet, (ii) encourage domestic and other customers to connect to the system, (iii) ensure that bills\nare paid to provide revenue for the Waterboard so that service provision is sustained, and (iv)\nreduce misuse of facilities, and limit the number of disconnections.\nTable A11.3: Summary of FIRR Analysis and Sensitivity Tests\nSubproject Base Costs Revenues Revenues Devaluation\nCase Increase decrease delayed  one 30%\n10% 10% year\nWater Supply\nWACC (-0.6%)\nKerema 4.6 3.4 3.3 3.7 2.9\nMendi 5.1 3.8 3.7 4.1 3.3\nWabag 4.8 3.5 3.3 3.8 3.0\nSewerage\nWACC (-0.8%)\nAlotau 3.8 2.6 2.5 3.0 2.2\nMt Hagen 9.1 6.0 5.6 6.4 4.7\nMadang 3.7 2.4 2.3 2.9 2.0\nWACC = weighted average cost of capital\n10.  The analysis for affordability looked at the tariff structure and used information on the\nnumber and volumes of consumers across user types and for different volumes of consumption\nin line with the current block tariff system. For water, the information used is for C category\ntowns, which are the smaller towns more relevant to the subprojects. For sewerage in Alotau\nand Madang, volumes were based on an average of all towns covered. Since Mt. Hagen\nalready has an existing system, actual data provided by the Waterboard was used. For a\nsubproject to be affordable to domestic customers while maintaining financial viability, a degree\nof cross-subsidization is needed from non-domestic to domestic customers and from higher\nvolume customers (those in higher income brackets) to lower volume customers (including the\npoor).\n11.  With careful structuring of tariffs within the current block system, subprojects can be\nmade more affordable without compromising financial objectives. The analysis calculates a\npossible tariff structure that, given current consumption patterns across comparable towns, will", "77\nAppendix 11, page 4\nachieve required average tariffs while keeping household bills to affordable levels. However,\nthese rates are indicative and are for assessing whether a tariff structure could be designed to\nachieve both affordability and financial objectives.\n12.  In all cases, the nondomestic high volume user was the main target to absorb most of\nthe impact of constraining the cost to the lower volume and domestic users. In the case of\nwater, for the lowest volume domestic users, the lifeline tariff remained at K3.5, less than 2\npercent of monthly income. For consumers in the middle volume block, average bills remain\nbelow  5  percent  of  household  income  at  the  25th  percentile.  The  resultant  high  volume,\nnondomestic tariffs were in the order of K2.4/kl, K3.7/kl, and K4.3/kl. Table A11.4 summarizes\nthe tariffs. It is evident that for towns where the number of connections is very low, constraining\ndomestic tariffs may lead to problems of affordability for nondomestic, high-volume consumers\ndespite their better ability to pay.\n13.  In the case of sewerage, the lifeline domestic tariff remained at K4.86, and average bills\nfor those in the lower and middle range incomes were less than 2 percent. The resultant high-\nvolume, non-domestic tariffs were in the order of K0.8/kl to K2.5/kl. Table A11.5 and A11.6\ncompares household incomes and proposed charges for a range of water supply consumption\nand sewerage volumes. The potential impact of tariff structure and proposed charges will be\nassessed further during project implementation. In particular, once the results of the 2000\ncensus are available, further analysis of incomes and nondomestic use in each subproject area\nwill assess the potential for differential tariffs. The analysis will also consider price and income\nelasticity of users, and the need for compliance, regulation, and enforcement, which will be\ncritical  where  nondomestic,  large-volume  charges  are  high.  In  conclusion,  the  affordability\nanalysis  shows  that  it  is  possible  to  design  a  tariff  structure  that  balances  the  need  for\naffordability and revenue generation. Detailed analysis and presentation of proposed charges\nfor different consumption levels for both domestic and non-domestic customers are in the\nSupplementary Appendix G.\nTable A11.4: Current and Proposed Tariffs, by User Type and Volume\nProposed For Water Supply (K) Proposed for Sewerage (K)\nVolume Current Kerema Mendi Wabag Current Alotau Mt.

Financial Projections\n14.  The Papua New Guinea Waterboard was established in 1986 under the National Water\nSupply and Sewerage (NWSS) Act, with a broad mandate to provide and regulate water and", "78\nAppendix 11, page 5\nsanitation services. The Waterboard operates and maintains services in 11 towns in Papua New\nGuinea, including Lae, the second largest town. Financial projections are based on existing\noperations and facilities proposed under the Project. The proposed ADB-financed project will\nprovide  water  services  in  three  towns  where  the  Waterboard  does  not  currently  operate\n(Kerema, Mendi, and Wabag) and sewerage services in three towns where the Waterboard\ncurrently  provides  water  supply  services  (Alotau,  Madang,  and  Mt.  Hagen).  The  capacity\nbuilding component and LCS-CAHE program will be financed by grants from the Australian\nAgency for International Development (AusAID) and Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR)\nrespectively.  Both  the  capacity  building  component  and  the  LCS-CAHE  program  are  not\ntargeted for cost recovery, and the LCS-CAHE program will be operated and maintained by the\nbeneficiaries. These component/program activities are not incorporated in the forecast.\n15.  Current  operating  costs  of  the  Waterboard  are  around  K14  million  including  water\nproduction, water distribution, sewerage services, and administration (Table A11.7). Wages and\nsalaries form the largest component although the workforce has been reduced by approximately\na third since 1995. Operating costs are assumed to increase at 3 percent above inflation.\nAdditional operating costs are estimated at K0.9 million in 2003 rising to K2.0 million in 2010\nand thereafter (2000 prices), including fixed and variable costs of administration, labor, power,\nmaintenance, chemicals, and incremental head office costs. Operating costs are assumed to\nincrease in line with inflation.\n16.  Project capital expenditure is estimated at K50 million over four years. This includes\nphysical contingencies of 20 percent for physical items and 10 percent for project management,\nand  price  contingencies  in  line  with  expected  inflation.  AusAID  will  finance  Waterboard\nexpenditure of A$45 million as a grant over the next five years. Since, the expenditure is not\ndetermined, this grant financing is not included in the forecast. If capital items are created\nthrough grant financing, then depreciation charges will be higher.\n17.  Revenues will come from direct user charges and other nonoperating income. Existing\nrevenues include the increase in tariffs of around 12 percent in April 2000. Revenues are\nassumed to increase by 2 percent per annum, reflecting a growth in consumption and number of\nconnections. Additional revenues from project components are assumed to be realized during\noperation of the facility. Tariffs for project towns are set for cost recovery with a small return in\nthe medium to long term.\n18.  The opening balance is based on an estimate of the Waterboard balance sheet for 1999.\nProject fixed assets are depreciated at 3.5 percent per annum on a declining balance. Existing\nassets are depreciated at 3.3 percent per annum for civil works and 3.5 percent for buildings,\nplant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. Accounts receivable represent 10 percent of\ncurrent period debit. Accounts payable represent about 10 percent of operating expenses.\nSeventy percent of additions to accounts payable are paid in the following year. The allowance\nfor doubtful debts represents 5 percent of current period debit. Long-term debt includes the ADB\nloan of $15.3 million from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund. Other long-term debt includes the\nADB and CTB loans, which are assumed to have an interest rate of 10 percent and a grace\nperiod of three years. Loan repayments begin in 2000, at K2.1 million. Nonoperational revenue\nin 1998 and 1999 provided windfall gains for the Waterboard from funds held as treasury bonds.\nIt is assumed that the funds held as short-term interest-bearing deposits will be used to fund\ncapital investment during 2000 and other expenditures. Other nonoperating revenue, mainly\nfrom engineering work, is assumed to continue. No changes to the existing tariff structure are\nassumed. However, the Waterboard, as expressed by the board and shown in its corporate\nplan, is moving toward full cost recovery, and further tariff increases are likely, even without the", "79\nAppendix 11, page 6\nProject. Loan conditions for real tariff increases of 20 percent by the year 2005 are incorporated\nin the forecast. It is likely that tariff would be increased much earlier.\n19.  Detailed financial projections go up to the year 2015. They cover the current operations\nof  the  Waterboard  and  the  facilities  proposed  under  the  Project.  The  projected  financial\nstatements are presented in current prices that include inflation in each year. A summary\nbalance sheet, sources and application of funds, and income statement is shown in Table\nA11.7.  Total  assets  are  seen  to  increase  to  K188  million  by  2010,  primarily  due  to  the\ncompletion of capital works under the Third ADB Water Supply Project, the revaluation of assets\nthat took place in 1999, and the proposed ADB Project.\n20.  On the basis of the existing tariffs, the proposed tariffs for the new project facilities and\nthe 20 percent real tariff increase required under the Project, the Waterboard will run at a loss\nuntil 2004. In 2005, the increase in revenue in line with the ADB loan condition is assumed to\noccur. Profits (measured by return on capital employed) in the early years are low, rising to 4.0\npercent by 2010.\n21.  The financial projections indicate that the Waterboard under the Project will be financially\nsustainable in the medium to long term. However, important factors will impact on the overall\nperformance of the agency and should be monitored carefully. First, expenditure on regulation\nand compliance is set to increase under Waterboard plans for improved performance, which will\nenhance revenue collection and should improve performance. The Waterboard is currently\ninvestigating  the  potential  impact  of  expenditure  scenarios.  Second,  the  impact  of  price\nincreases on consumption is important, particularly for the proposed Project, and further work\nshould be undertaken on the potential impact of tariffs.", "Table A11.5:  Household Income and Proposed Charges  Table A11.6:  Household Income and Proposed \nfor a Range of Water Supply Consumption Charges for a Range of Sewerage Volumesa\nKerema Mt Hagen\nMonthly HH Income at nth Percentile Monthly HH Income at nth Percentile\nCharges (K) 10th 25th 75th Mean Charges (K) 10th 25th 75th Mean\nVolume (kl) Current Proposed 433 541 1060 954 Volume (kl) Current Proposed 216 352 1083 1086\nPercent of Monthly Income Percent of Monthly Income\n10 3.5 3.5 1% 1% 0% 0% 10 4.9 4.9 2% 1% 0% 0%\n20 8.6 13.5 3% 2% 1% 1% 20 6.0 8.9 6% 4% 1% 1%\n30 15.0 26.0 6% 5% 2% 3% 30 7.4 13.9 12% 7% 2% 2%\n40 42.0 50.0 12% 9% 5% 5% 40 5.7 20.0 23% 14% 5% 5%\n50 52.5 62.5 14% 12% 6% 7% 50 7.2 25.0 29% 18% 6% 6%\n80 84.0 100.0 23% 18% 9% 10% 80 11.4 40.0 46% 28% 9% 9%\n100 105.0 125.0 29% 23% 12% 13% 100 14.3 50.0 58% 36% 12% 12%\nMendi Madang\nMonthly HH Income at nth Percentile Monthly HH Income at nth Percentile\nCharges (K) 10th 25th 75th Mean Charges (K) 10th 25th 75th Mean 8\nVolume kl Current Proposed 316 478 1291 939 Volume kl Current Proposed 322 438 1002 954 0\nPercent of Monthly Income Percent of Monthly Income\n10 3.5 3.5 1% 1% 0% 0% 10 4.9 4.9 2% 1% 0% 0%\n20 8.6 19.5 5% 4% 2% 2% 20 6.0 8.9 9% 6% 2% 2%\n30 15.0 39.5 9% 7% 4% 4% 30 7.4 13.9 18% 11% 4% 4%\n40 42.0 80.0 18% 15% 8% 8% 40 5.7 20.0 37% 23% 7% 7%\n50 52.5 100.0 23% 18% 9% 10% 50 7.2 25.0 46% 28% 9% 9%\n80 84.0 160.0 37% 30% 15% 17% 80 11.4 40.0 74% 45% 15% 15%\n100 105.0 200.0 46% 37% 19% 21% 100 14.3 50.0 93% 57% 18% 18%\nWabag a Alotau is not included since customers are all non-domestic\nMonthly HH Income at nth Percentile\n10th 25th 75th Mean A\np\nVolume kl Current Proposed 308 498 1013 865 p\ne\nPercent of Monthly Income n\nd\n10 3.5 3.5 1% 1% 0% 0% ix\n20 8.6 19.5 5% 4% 2% 2%  1\n1\n3400 1452..00 3860..00 188%% 175%% 38%% 48%% , pa\n50 52.5 100.0 23% 18% 9% 10% g\ne\n80 84.0 160.0 37% 30% 15% 17%  7\n100 105.0 200.0 46% 37% 19% 21%", "Table A11.7:  PNG Waterboard\nFinancial Statements, 2000- 2015\n(K million)\nBALANCE SHEETS 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets 18 19 20 19 22 31 41 51 63 72 83 94 106 119 133 147\nNet Fixed Assets 117 118 129 149 147 140 134 127 120 113 106 98 91 84 77 70\nTotal Assets 135 138 149 169 169 172 174 178 182 185 188 193 198 204 210 218\nLIABILITIES\nCurrent Liabilities 4 5 5 5 5 6 7 8 10 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nLong-term Liabiliites 24 30 40 54 58 57 57 57 55 53 50 48 45 43 40 37\nTotal Liabilities 29 34 44 59 63 64 64 64 65 63 61 60 58 56 55 53\nEquity 107 103 105 109 107 108 110 113 117 122 127 133 140 147 156 165\nTotal Assets and Liabilities 135 138 149 169 169 172 174 178 182 185 188 193 198 204 210 218\nINCOME STATEMENTS 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\nOperating Revenues 17 18 19 22 24 33 36 39 42 45 48 51 55 59 62 67\nOperating Expenses 13 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 33 35 38 41 44 47\nIncome Before Depreciation 3 3 4 4 4 11 12 13 14 15 16 16 17 18 19 19\nDepreciation 5 5 5 6 6 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\nOperating Income -1 -2 -2 -2 -2 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 10 11 11 12\nNet Non-Operating Income -1 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 0 0 1 1 2\nIncome Tax Expense 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 5\nNet Income -3 -4 -4 -4 -4 2 3 5 6 6 8 9 10 11 13 14\nCASH FLOW STATEMENTS 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\n8\nSources of Funds 1\nInternal Cash Generation 4 4 4 4 5 11 12 13 13 15 16 16 17 18 19 19\nGovernment Investment 0 0 5 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nBorrowing 3 6 10 15 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nTotal Sources 8 10 20 28 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 16 17 18 19 19\nApplication of Funds\nCapital Investment 11 6 16 26 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nDebt Service 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\nIncrease in Working Capital 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3\nTotal Applications 14 9 20 30 9 4 5 4 5 8 7 8 8 8 8 8\nNet Change in Cash -7 1 0 -2 1 7 7 9 9 7 8 9 9 10 10 11\nTARGETS AND RATIOS 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\nCurrent Ratio 4.27 4.17 4.21 3.86 4.17 4.94 5.80 6.58 6.37 7.02 7.42 7.86 8.26 8.62 8.96 9.27\nLong-Term Debt to Capital Employed 0.19 0.23 0.28 0.34 0.35 0.35 0.34 0.34 0.33 0.31 0.30 0.28 0.26 0.24 0.22 0.20\nOperating Ratio (%) 109 110 109 108 109 88 87 85 84 83 82 82 82 82 82 82\nDebt Service 0.34 0.29 0.22 0.18 0.18 0.32 0.35 0.38 0.41 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.67 0.75 0.84\nRate of Return on Average Capital Emloyed ( 0 -3 -3 -2 -3 1 2 3 4 4 4 5 6 6 7 7\nRate of Return on Average Net Fixed Assets  -5 -3 -3 -3 -3 1 2 4 5 5 7 9 11 13 16 19\nA\nAverage Rate of Return on Capital Employed (2001-201 0.70% p\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 1\n1\n, p\na\ng\ne\n 8", "82\nAppendix 12, page 1\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\nA.  Economic Context\n1.  Many provincial towns in Papua New Guinea do not have a reticulated water supply and\nmost do not have adequate facilities for collecting and safely disposing of wastewater. Where a\nreticulated water system is not available, rainwater tanks and streams are the main sources of\nwater. Considerable problems are experienced during the dry periods when residents often turn\nto alternative, often polluted, sources of water, risking exposure to waterborne diseases. Current\nsanitation practices also pose a major health risk. Water sources are being polluted by open-air\ndefecation, seepage from pit latrines, improper disposal of septic sludge and bucket waste and\noverflowing septic tanks. Living conditions are generally poor and the incidence of diseases\nassociated with lack of clean water and inadequate sanitation facilities is high. The poorer\nsegments of society who also have the least means to fund alternative water supplies from\nsources and medical treatment suffer most from the lack of these basic facilities.\n2.  The proposed Project provides a new reticulated water system, including storage and\nchlorination in Mendi and Kerema, and upgrading of the existing system in Wabag. It also\nprovides for waste collection and treatment for the central business district (CBD) in Alotau,\nrehabilitation of the existing collection and treatment facility in Madang, and upgrading of the\nexisting treatment facility in Mt. Hagen. In addition, a LCS-CAHE program (JFPR funded) will\nprovide low-cost sanitation (LCS) facilities in six provincial towns, targeting peri-urban areas\nwhere the needs are highest and reticulation systems are not viable.\nB.  Methodology and Approach\n3.  The  economic  analysis  is  undertaken  separately  for  each  subproject  or  town.  The\nanalysis  establishes  the  economic  rationale,  describes  beneficiaries,  sets  out  the  without-\nProject  situation,  assesses  the  need  and  demand  for  each  component,  and  examines\nalternatives  where  they  are  available.  Since  the  benefits  are  nontradeable  in  nature,  the\ndomestic  price  numeraire  is  used  and  financial  costs  are  converted  into  economic  costs,\nincluding physical contingencies but excluding taxes and duties. The shadow exchange rate\nfactor of 1.1 is applied to tradables, no other conversion factors are used. The analysis was\nconstant June 2000 prices.\n4.  The calculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for each subproject is compared\nwith the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC), which is assumed to be 10 percent for\nwater supply subprojects and 10 percent for sewerage subprojects, given their environmental\nbenefits. The analysis also assesses nonvalued factors, which are particularly important, given\nthe difficulties of valuing benefits.\nC. Water Supply\n1.  Subproject Selection and Alternatives\n5.  Three towns of the five considered under the project preparatory technical assistance\n(PPTA) were chosen for the introduction of Waterboard water supply services. Systems in the\nother towns were not considered viable.\n6.  For Kerema, groundwater and surface water sources were considered. The chosen\nalternative  was  the  groundwater  scheme  as  it  has  the  least  cost.  There  was  no  feasible\nalternative for Mendi. For Wabag, the proposed subproject is an upgrading of the existing\nsystem, which is not operated by the Waterboard. This option would be considerably cheaper\nthan introducing of a new scheme and is therefore also the least-cost option.", "83\nAppendix 12, page 2\n2.  Without-Project Situation\n7.  Without the Project, Kerema and Mendi will continue without a reticulated water supply\nsystem.  In  Wabag,  the  town  is  likely  to  continue  experiencing  problems  with  quality  and\npressure of the water supply, and the system will eventually fail completely. Residents will\ncontinue to suffer during dry periods, being forced to pay water vendors for water of suspect\nquality or search for alternative supplies, which are becoming increasingly contaminated.\n3. Project Beneficiaries and Demand for Water\n8.  In all three subproject towns, the proposed reticulated system will cover 100 percent of\nthe urban area, with 4,900 residents in Kerema, 12,100 in Mendi, and 3,700 in Wabag in 2000.\nSystems are designed to the Waterboard standard of 270 liters per capita per day (lpcd). This\nstandard includes demand from nondomestic users. Domestic consumption is on average 90\nlpd or 21kiloliters (kl) per connection per month. This is low by Pacific standards. Nondomestic\nuse is conservatively estimated at 109 kl per connection per month.  Demand projections are\nbased on expected population growth and economic trends within the town.\n4. Economic Rate of Return Analysis\na. Costs and Benefits\n9.  Capital and operation and maintenance costs are converted to economic costs and are\nphased  over  the  life  period  of  the  Project.  Capital  costs  are  adjusted  to  exclude  project\nmanagement costs, which cover the subprojects other than water supply and sewerage.\n10.  The component will supply water to the urban areas of the three towns. In Kerema and\nMendi, in addition to the increased volume of water supplied, incremental benefits include\nimprovement in quality, pressure, and reliability of the existing water. Benefits include resource\ncost savings from reductions in (i) the need to install and maintain rain tanks, (ii) time and effort\nin collecting water in dry periods, (iii) amounts paid for water from water vendors during dry\nperiods, (iv) risk of waterborne disease and other diseases associated with lack of water for\nwashing, and (v) damage to the environment from the use of rivers and streams for washing.\n11.  As recorded in the PPTA social survey, households were willing to pay on average about\nK16 per month for water in Kerema, K13 per month in Mendi, and K8 per month in Wabag. The\nexpressed willingness to pay is less than the actual amount paid for untreated water during the\ndry season, which is estimated at K30-K90 per month, based on minimum consumption levels\nand prices paid for tankers or containers.\n12.  The benefits from the subprojects were based on (i) the value of nonincremental water at\nits average supply price, (ii) incremental water at the proposed average tariff, (iii) 10 percent\nnontechnical losses valued at the proposed average tariffs, and (iv) savings in maintenance\ncosts for water supplies. The average supply price of non-incremental water is the weighted\naverage price of all existing water sources including rain tanks, streams, wells, and water\nvendors and is calculated to be K2.8 for Kerema, K4.6 for Mendi and K8.6 for Wabag.\n13.  Valued  benefits  attempt  to  cover  direct  benefits  to  households  and  businesses.\nHowever, the benefits are likely to be underestimated, since the proposed water charges are\nintentionally kept to a minimum. The social and environmental benefits of a reticulated, safe,\nand reliable water supply include public health benefits, which are not fully reflected in the\nsupply price and which are the primary objective of the Project.\nb. Results\n14.  Table A12.1 summarizes the results of the EIRR analysis and the sensitivity tests. The\nbase case EIRRs for Kerema, Mendi, and Wabag are 12.7 percent, 13.3 percent, and 12.8", "84\nAppendix 12, page 3\npercent respectively. While these values are relatively low compared with the EOCC of 10\npercent, significant economic benefits, particularly public health benefits, have not been fully\nvalued  and  are  not  reflected  in  the  EIRR  analysis.  Given  the  significant  nonvalued\nenvironmental and health benefits, the calculated EIRRs understate the true value of the EIRR,\nand the subprojects are considered economically viable.\nTable A12.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Tests\nItem Kerema Mendi Wabag\nBase case\n   Economic Internal Rate of Return (%) 13.33 11.98 12.81\n   Net Present Value (K) 1,251,853 2,265,417 1,281,127\nSensitivity Analysis\n   Costs Increase by 10% (%) 11.70 10.44 11.21\n                            Sensitivity Indicator 1.04 1.23 1.11\n   Revenue Reduced by 10% (%) 11.54 10.28 11.05\n                            Sensitivity Indicator 1.17 1.38 1.25\n   Costs Increase and Benefits Reduced by 10.00 8.79 9.52\n   10% (%)\n   Benefits Delayed by One Year (%) 11.30 10.13 10.83\nSwitching Value(%)\n   Cost increase 8.00 - 5.00\n   Revenue reduce 7.00 - 5.00\nD. Sewerage\n1.  Subproject Selection and Alternatives\n15.  Three towns of the five considered under the PPTA were chosen for the sewerage\nservices. Systems in the other towns were not considered viable.\n16.  In Alotau, two service coverage options were considered for the reticulated system. In\nthe first, the system would cover only the CBD; in the second, the system would include nearby\nresidential areas. For the CBD, topographic and space constraints make on-site sanitation\ninappropriate; while for the residential areas, on-site sanitation was found to be cheaper. The\nsubproject  design  therefore  restricts  the  service  area  to  the  CBD  but  allows  capacity  for\nexpansion to accommodate residential flows if required.\n17.  In Mt. Hagen, the proposed subproject is to rehabilitate the existing treatment works,\nwhich  do  not  function  properly  and  are  an  environmental  hazard.  The  service  area  was\nconsidered in assessing the appropriate size of the facility. The first option was to cover existing\nflows and the second to allow for an increased number of connections. As in Alotau, on-site\nsanitation was cheaper for those not already connected; thus the subproject involves only\nrehabilitation of the existing plant.\n18.  In  Madang,  three  technical  treatment  options  were  considered.  The  least-cost\nalternative, which involves the proper use and rehabilitation of existing facilities, forms the\nproposed subproject.\n2. The Without-Project Situation\n19.  Without the Project, the residents will be exposed to greater health risks, and lack of\nadequate  facilities  for  collection  and  disposal  of  wastewater  will  affect  amenity  and", "85\nAppendix 12, page 4\nenvironmental quality within the town. In Mt. Hagen and Madang, the subprojects include the\nrehabiliation of existing facilities, which themselves pose a significant health and environmental\nhazard.\n3. Project Beneficiaries and Demand for Sewerage Services\n20.  In all three towns, the proposed subproject provides facilities for a specific area within\nthe town. In Mt Hagen and Madang, the need is for primarily rehabilitating and upgrading\nexisting facilities to enable them to treat and dispose of existing flows effectively. In Alotau, the\nCBD is the area covered. The total number of connections is about 680. However, all residents\nwill indirectly benefit from public health, and environmental and amenity improvements, giving a\ntotal of about 70,000 beneficiaries.\n4. Economic Rate of Return Analysis\na. Costs and Benefits\n21.  Capital and operation and maintenance costs are converted to economic costs and are\nphased over the life period of the Project, which is assumed to be 25 years. Capital costs are\nadjusted to exclude project management costs, which cover the subprojects other than water\nsupply and sewerage.\n22.  The component will permit safe and environmentally sound disposal of wastewater in the\nurban  areas  of  the  three  towns.  Benefits  are  valued  considering  the  proposed  subproject\nrevenues and an amount for improvements to public health. Public health benefits are estimated\nat K3.5 per person per year, based on the incidence of waterborne and sanitation-related\ndiseases in Madang, average length of illness, and cost of medicines. This represents around\n20 percent of provincial expenditure on public health.1\nb. Results\n23.  Table A12.2 summarizes the results of the EIRR analysis and the sensitivity tests. The\nbase case EIRRs for Alotau, Mt. Hagen, and Madang are 11.4 percent, 19.2 percent and 14.6\npercent, respectively. The calculated EIRRs considerably underestimate the true EIRRs as not\nall environmental and public health benefits could be correctly valued.\nTable A12.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Tests\nItem Alotau Mt.

Poverty Impact\n25. The human poverty index for Papua New Guinea ranks it as one of the most poverty-\nafflicted nations in the world. About 16 percent of the urban population are categorized as poor,\nand most do not have access to systems for reliable water supply and safe disposal of excreta.\nThe subprojects and the LCS-CAHE program (JFPR funded) will benefit all town residents,\nincluding the poor, by improving public health and the environment. Since the poor are least\nable  to  purchase  water  during  the  dry  season,  or  medicines  for  treating  waterborne  and\nsanitation-related  diseases  prevalent  in  the  subproject  towns,  they  will  be  significant\nbeneficiaries  of  the  subprojects.  In  addition,  the  Waterboard  pricing  structure  is  designed\nspecifically to ensure that the poor are not excluded. Connection fees were abolished and a\nlifeline tariff provides domestic households with access to safe water at a very low rate. The\npoor will have significant savings, considering the cost of their existing, untreated, and often\npolluted water supply.\nF. Summary\n26. The six water supply and sewerage subprojects are all economically viable. In fact, the\nEIRRs probably understate the true economic value of the subprojects, since significant health\nand environmental benefits are not fully reflected in the calculations."], "metadata": {"Author": "jm9", "CreationDate": "D:20001125154310Z", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "ModDate": "D:20131111180627+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R277-00rrp"}}
