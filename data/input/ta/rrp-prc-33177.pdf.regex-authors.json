An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was \nAssessment  undertaken. The summary EIA was circulated to the Board along \nwith the summary resettlement action plan on 29 July 2002. \n \nProject Description  The Project will help meet the demand for high-quality treated \nwater to the city of Harbin through 2010. The reservoir and head \nworks  developed  by  the  Project  will  have  adequate  storage \ncapacity to support a second phase of development sufficient to \nmeet the needs through 2019. Harbin City, with over 3 million \nresidents,  is  the  capital  of  Heilongjiang  Province  and  is  the \nseventh largest city in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction through provision \nof  water  supply  connections,  lifeline  tariffs,  increased  water \nsupply  to  targeted  poor  areas,  and  employment  generation \nduring its implementation and operation. Capacity building and \ntraining will assist implementation and increase efficiency in the \nHarbin  Municipal  Water  Supply  Construction  Company \n(HMWSCC)  and  the  Harbin  Municipal  Tap  Water  Company \n(HMTWC). \n \nRationale  The Project will relieve a large deficit in supply capacity, estimated \nat 450,000 m3/day in 2005. The last major expansion in treatment \ncapacity was completed in 1993. Since the mid-1980s, Harbin has \nbeen studying options and arranging the financing for a new clean \nwater source. The proposed Mopanshan dam will be built in the \nupper reaches of the Lalin River, about 175 kilometers (km) from \nHarbin City. The Project was identified in the Government\u2019s 10th \nFive-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) as a key water supply project and as \na technically viable least-cost alternative to the continued reliance \non the polluted Songhua River as a source of water for Harbin \nCity. \n \nThe Songhua River, the major existing source of raw water for the \ncity of Harbin, is severely polluted by the discharge of untreated or \npartially  treated  wastewater  from  upstream  industries,  in \nHeilongjiang and Jilin provinces. The river, which flows through \nthe Inner Mongolia Autonomous region and Jilin and Heilongjiang \nprovinces and then into the Russian Federation, is contaminated \nwith a number of trace organic chemicals, some metals, and \nconventional pollutants. The Government classifies its water as \nClass IV (declining to V\u2013VI during the low-flow winter season), \nwhich  is  unsuitable  for  domestic  water  use.  The  river  water \nparameters  consistently  fail  to  meet  Class  III  standards,  the \nminimum quality required for the water to be used as a source for ", "ii \nminimum quality required for the water to be used as a source for \nwater supply. A 3-year government research study project on \nchemical pollution in the Songhua, completed in March 2002, \nidentified 191 trace organic chemicals in the river, of which 46 are \nknown and suspected as causing serious health problems. The \nGovernment  is  taking  measures  to  decrease  pollution  in  the \nSonghua,  beginning  with  adoption  of  the  Songhua  Pollution \nControl Plan (expected to be approved by the State Council in \nMarch 2003). Implementation of the plan will facilitate the return of \nthe Songhua River to Class III water quality levels but this is \nunlikely to be achieved earlier than 2015. The Project will provide \nthe required clean water while the Songhua is being cleaned of its \npollution. Through the technical assistance for Songhua River \nWater Quality and Pollution Control Management (approved in \nDecember 2002), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will assist \nthe Government in refining the Songhua Pollution Control Plan \nand  finalizing  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  clean-up  of  the \nSonghua River basin. \n \nUse of existing public and self-supplied groundwater is depleting \nthe aquifer beneath the city, resulting in land subsidence and \ndamage to buildings. With the Project, wells will be placed on \nstandby status, to meet maximum daily and emergency demands, \nand groundwater use will be limited to sustainable yields.  \n \nObjectives and Scope  The main objectives of the Project are to (i) provide 450,000 \nm3/day of clean water supply in Harbin; (ii) improve public health \nby  providing  clean  safe  water;  (iii) promote  long-term  urban \ndevelopment  in  Harbin  City  by  avoiding  water  shortages; \n(iv) provide  institutional  strengthening  of  HMWSCC  and \nHMTWC; and (v) use tariff reform to achieve full cost recovery.  \n \nThe  Project  scope  includes  (i) a  45-meter  high  dam  at \nMopanshan with a reservoir volume of 356 million m3, a diversion \ntunnel and river outlet works, a water intake tower and raw water \nsupply tunnel, and a gated spillway; (ii) a 175.5 km raw water \npipeline  delivering  water  from  Mopanshan  dam  by  gravity  to \nHarbin; (iii) a 450,000 m3/day capacity water treatment plant; \n(iv) expansion and rehabilitation of the water distribution network, \nby installing 73.8 km of large pipes, 18 km of smaller pipes, and \nseparation valves; and (v) capacity  building  of  HMWSCC  and \nHMTWC. As a result of the inundation of areas behind the dam, \nabout  6,022  persons  (1,740  households)  will  be  relocated, \nmostly to host villages within the same county. \n ", "iii   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost si $399.5 million equivalent, including a \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  $100.0 million  (25%)  and  a  local \ncurrency cost of $299.5 million equivalent (75%).

HMWSCC, as the project implementing agency, will be \nresponsible for day-to-day supervision and implementation of the \nProject. \nExecuting Agency  Harbin Municipal Government \n \nProcurement  ADB-financed  equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Major \ncontracts for equipment and materials will be tendered through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  or  international  shopping \nprocedures, depending on the contract amount. \n \nConsulting Services  About 62 person-months of international consultants, including 8 \nperson-months for an independent international dam panel and 7 \nperson-months  for  a  resettlement monitoring panel, and 130 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consultants  will  be  required. \nExpertise  will  be  needed  in  dam  design,  construction \nsupervision,  and  quality  control;  resettlement  monitoring; \npipeline,  treatment  plant,  and  network  construction  and \nimprovement;  ADB  procurement  procedures  and  reporting \nrequirements;  social  and  environmental  monitoring;  and  tariff \nanalysis, quality control, and project performance management \nsystems. The international consultants will also provide training \nand capacity building in water supply planning, water resources \nand  quality  management,  financial  management,  and \nenvironmental monitoring and management. The consultants will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit a population of around 3 million people \nBeneficiaries  (including a largely poor floating population of 283,000), of which \n  32% have incomes below the ADB operational urban poverty line \nof  CNY3,300  per  person  per  year.  The  Project  includes  the ", "v   \nof  CNY3,300  per  person  per  year.  The  Project  includes  the \nimplementation  of  a  poverty  intervention  program  directly \nbenefiting 325,000 poor with an annual per capita income below \nCNY3,300,  including  (i) waiving  future  tariff  increases  for  the \npoorest households, and (ii) connecting the poorest households \nto  tap  water  in  Harbin\u2019s  five  poverty  districts.  The  Project \nincludes monitoring mechanisms and a loan assurance that the \npopulation below the ADB urban poverty line (about 889,000 \nbeneficiaries, including the 325,000 poor) will have access to the \nnew water supply and could be eligible for the waiver on tariff \nincreases, lifeline tariffs, and free meters and connections if they \ncannot  afford  project  water.  The  Project  will  improve  public \nhealth in Harbin. It will also create a minimum of 800 permanent \njobs for the operation of the facilities, and 3,500 jobs during the \n5-year construction period. The extraction of groundwater will be \nreduced to sustainable levels, thus reducing land subsidence.  \n \nPublic  health  benefits  will  accrue  through  a  reduction  in \nwaterborne diseases and reduced exposure to dangerous trace \norganic chemicals. The reliable supply of water will reduce the \nburden on women responsible for domestic duties and caring for \nthe sick. The benefits of such improvements are included in the \neconomic analysis of the Project using stated willingness to pay \nof domestic customers, with a possible addition to the economic \nbenefits and reduction in health care costs.  \n \nADB-supported tariff reforms in the PRC water sector facilitated \nboth  the  policy  dialogue  on  tariff  reforms  and  cost  recovery \nundertaken  during  project  processing  and  the  introduction  of \nrecent tariff increases in Harbin. The financing of water supply \ninfrastructure directly from water tariff increases ($70 million), \nwhich  is  in  line  with  the  ADB  water  policy,  will  have  a \ndemonstration impact on water tariff reforms in both the PRC \nand the rest of Asia. The Project is technically sound, affordable \nto beneficiaries, and financially and economically viable with a \nfinancial  internal  rate  of return of 6.0% (higher than the real \nweighted average cost of capital of 4.5%) and a base case \neconomic internal rate of return of 12.6% (18.2% if benefits from \ndecreased health care costs are added). \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Potential institutional, financial, and policy risks related to the \nProject  include  failure  of  (i) HMG  to  implement  institutional \nreforms;  (ii) HMG  to  increase  tariffs  to  meet  cost-recovery \ntargets; (iii) HMTWC to honor the water purchase agreements; \nand (iv) HMG to meet the equity requirements to implement the \nProject.  These  risks  have  been  mitigated  by  (i) obtaining \nassurances from HPG and HMG on the financial and managerial \nautonomy  of  HMWSCC;  (ii) institutional strengthening of both \nHMWSCC and HMTWC; (iii) periodic water tariff reviews and \nadjustments following the national guidelines; and (iv) provision \nof  counterpart  funding.  ADB  review  missions  will  monitor ", "vi \nof  counterpart  funding.  ADB  review  missions  will  monitor \ncompliance  with  the  financial  and  operational  covenants  to \nensure  HMWSCC  financial  sustainability.  Although  it  is  not, \nstrictly speaking, a project risk, adherence of the Government to \nan agreed program of cleaning up the Songhua River is another \nissue of concern. This risk would be mitigated, in part, by the \ntechnical  assistance  for  Songhua  River  Water  Quality  and \nPollution Control Management approved in December 2002, and \nregular follow-up/monitoring of the Project by ADB.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Harbin Water Supply Project. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  In line with its long-term goals for the urban sector of improving living conditions and \nexpanding the supply of clean water, the Government of the PRC has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to assist in increasing the supply of clean water to the city of Harbin. \nThis report is based on the findings of the loan appraisal mission and discussions with central, \nnational, and local government agencies concerned. The project framework is in Appendix 1 \nand the project processing chronology in Appendix 2. Past ADB assistance to the PRC in the \nsector is given in Appendix 3.  \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Annual economic growth in the PRC has been 8% over the last 20 years and economic \ngrowth is projected at 7% over the next 5 years. The urbanization rate has increased to 36% \nand is expected to rise to at least 50% by 2030. This urbanization process will continue to \nincrease the demand for all urban services. In particular, it will place a strain on the physical and \nfinancial capacity of most cities to provide adequate water infrastructure. Without significant \ninvestment, there will be a deterioration of the quality of life for urban residents, degradation of \nthe urban environment, and inefficient economic development.  \n4.  Municipal water supply in the PRC has increased steadily in the past decade. In 1999, \ntotal water production and sale were 26.8 billion m3/day and 22.8 billion m3/day, respectively, \nwith unaccounted-for water (UFW) at 15% of total water production. The industrial and domestic \nwater sales account for 35.5% and 55.3% of water sold respectively while other sales are 9.2%. \nThe calculated national average use of water was 362 liters per capita per day (lpcd). Domestic \nconsumption was 200 lpcd. In most large PRC cities, more than 90% of all urban households \nhave access to piped water supply. However, this good coverage indicator obscures shortages \nin many cities of high-quality raw water supply, water supply delivery capacities, and wastewater \ntreatment facilities. The Government has classified more than 300 cities as \u201cwater short\u201d, with \n108 having serious water problems and more than 60 being critically short of water. The \nsituation has been exacerbated by the pollution of raw water sources by the discharge of \ninadequately treated agricultural, municipal, and industrial wastewater.  \n5.  The Government has recognized the severity of the water problem and identified the \nwater  sector  as  one  of  the  priority  sectors  of  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005). The \nGovernment\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) developing water sources; (ii) protecting existing sources \nby controlling industrial and residential pollution; (iii) controlling overextraction from groundwater \nresources; (iv) introducing water-efficient technologies and operations; and (v) using appropriate \npricing mechanisms to encourage conservation and generate necessary funds for operation, \nmaintenance,  and  investment.  Government  guidelines  for  urban  water  supply  emphasize \n(i) proper planning, (ii) mobilizing financial resources for the construction of new facilities, (iii) full \ncost recovery from industrial and commercial users, (iv) recovery of at least operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs from residential users with a movement toward full cost recovery, \n(iv) use of loans to finance urban water supply, and (v) application of new technology where \nappropriate. The Government\u2019s ongoing economic and enterprise reform programs require that ", "2 \nall  water  supply  and  wastewater  projects  be  financially  sustainable  and  capable  of  cost \nrecovery. The water supply sector analysis is given in Appendix 4. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  Harbin City is included in the Government\u2019s list of 108 cities that have serious water \nproblems. The proposed Project was identified in the Government\u2019s 10th Five-Year Plan as a \nkey water supply project and the technically viable least-cost alternative to the continued \nreliance on the polluted Songhua River as the source of water for Harbin. It is also considered a \n\u201ckey lifeline project\u201d for Harbin City and Heilongjiang Province.  \n7.  Key problems and opportunities include (i) unsatisfied demand for clean water in Harbin; \n(ii) pollution of the existing water sources, both surface and underground; (iii) land subsidence \narising from the overuse of groundwater; and (iv) making water supply self-financing through \ntariff reforms and possible private sector partnership.  \n1.  Background and Long-Term Plans for Songhua \n8.  The Songhua River basin is the third largest river basin in the PRC after the Chang \n(Yangtze) and Huang (Yellow) rivers. It has an area of 557,000 square kilometers (km2) and a \npopulation of 62 million. Major cities such as Harbin and Changchun, and the PRC\u2019s largest oil \nfields are located in the basin. Agriculture is well developed and there is a large industrial base. \nThe Songhua River catchment area covers portions of three provinces\u2014Jilin and Heilongjiang \nprovinces and the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. After Harbin, the river joins the \nHeilongjiang River, enters the Russian Federation, and eventually discharges into the sea. \n9.  The Songhua River, the major existing source of raw water for the city of Harbin, is one \nof the most polluted among 47 major rivers in the PRC.1 The pollution is mainly because of the \ndischarge of untreated or partially treated wastewater, primarily from industries upstream from \nHarbin. The Songhua River, which is contaminated with a number of known and suspected trace \norganic chemicals, metals, and conventional pollutants, is classified by the Government as \nClass IV2 (falling below Class V during the 6-month low-flow winter season), and is considered \nunsuitable for municipal domestic water use. The river water parameters consistently fail to \nmeet PRC Class III standards, the minimum water quality required for the water to be used as a \nraw water source for water supply. Trace organic chemical pollution of the Songhua River was \nfirst reported in the early 1980s. A 3-year government research study completed in March 2002 \non  chemical  pollution  in  the  Songhua  River  and  associated  health  risks  supported  by \ninternational specialists identified 191 trace organic chemicals, of which 46 chemicals are \nknown or suspected as causing serious health problems.3 The chemicals appear to be coming \nfrom petrochemical plants and agricultural areas upstream from Harbin. The government study \nindicated that trace organic chemicals detected in the water distributed indicated heightened \nhealth risks linked to consumption of Songhua River water. In recent years there have been a \n                                                 \n1  In addition to being heavily polluted, the Songhua River is adversely affected by frequent large-scale flooding and \ndrought. A large flooding event in August 1998 surrounded the water intake plant at Harbin and flooded a key \ntransmission line. Drought conditions in July 2000 caused historically low water levels, which stranded the water \nintake structures causing a water shortage throughout the city. \n2  The PRC water quality standards have five classes of quality covering about 40 pollution parameters. Class I is \npristine, while Class V is suitable only for industrial use.  \n3  Completed  in  March  2002,  the  study  was  undertaken  by  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Environmental  Protection \nResearch Institute, Harbin City and National Environmental Monitoring and Testing Stations; Songliao Water \nResource Protection Bureau; Harbin University of Medicine; Harbin University of Industries; and Sawa University, \nFrance. ", "3 \nnumber of initiatives to control Songhua River water quality and pollution emissions. However, it \nis still uncertain as to how long the Songhua River might remain excessively polluted. A \ngovernment deadline for providing industrial wastewater treatment by December 2000 was \nassociated  with  control  of  conventional  pollutants,  rather  than  the  types  of  trace  organic \nchemicals affecting the Harbin water supply system. At the same time, water pollution from \npesticides,  chemical  fertilizers,  and  trace  organic  chemicals  from  nonpoint  sources  may \ncontinue, given that there is a 400,000 km2 drainage area upstream from Harbin. It is difficult to \ncontrol  the  pollution  from  the  several million  farmers  within  the  river  basin  applying  such \nchemicals under existing legal and enforcement regimes.  \n10.  Existing public and self-supplied groundwater use is depleting the aquifer beneath the \ncity, resulting in land subsidence and damage to buildings. The groundwater is polluted by \nrecharge from uncollected urban wastewater and soluble trace organic chemicals in river water, \nand is becoming a serious public health concern. \n11.  The Songhua Pollution Control Plan prepared by the State Environmental Protection \nAdministration (SEPA), and expected to be approved by the State Council in March 2003, is the \nbeginning of concrete steps needed to bring the Songhua River back to the minimum Class III \nwater quality levels. The main objectives of the plan include (i) protecting the sources of urban \ndrinking water supply; (ii) accelerating the construction of centralized treatment facilities for \nmunicipal sewage; (iii) controlling pollution from enterprises that have the largest pollution load \nand  volume  and  are  potentially  the  most  damaging  to  the  ecosystems;  (iv) strengthening \necological  construction  and  protection;  and  (v) strengthening  capacity  in  law  enforcement, \nmonitoring, and research and information systems. The general water quality targets include \nimproving  water  quality  in  the  mainstream  Songhua  and  key  tributaries  to  water  quality \nstandards,  the  entire  Songhua  watershed  meeting  water  quality  standards  by  2015,  and \nensuring  the  sustainable  utilization  of  water  resources.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nSonghua River Water Quality and Pollution Control Management4 will assist the Government in \nrefining the Songhua Pollution Control Plan and in finalizing the time-bound action plan for the \nclean-up of the Songhua River basin. The action plan will oblige compliance from the industrial, \ndomestic, and nonpoint source polluters to the proposed actions through selected programs and \npriority investment projects, including those to be financed by ADB. In line with government \npolicy, the TA will assist in undertaking a public information campaign on the health risks \nassociated with Songhua River water pollution and help in mobilizing public support for cleaning \nup the Songhua River. The last major expansion in treatment capacity of Songhua River water \nintake and treatment facilities (250,000 m3/day) was completed in 1993. Further expansion of \nwater supply is overdue, and Harbin is forecast to have a shortage in water supply capacity of at \nleast 450,000 m3 /day in 2007, increasing to at least 950,000 m3/day by 2020. \n2.  Alternative Sources \n12.  Due to the increasing levels of pollution of the Songhua River since the mid-1980s, \nHarbin has been studying options and arranging the financing to develop a new clean water \nsource. Over a period of 10 years, five alternative reservoir sites were examined in detail for \nHarbin water supply. Of these, only one could provide the same quantity of water as the Project, \nbut  at  a  unit  cost  one  third  greater.  Water  pollution  and  significant  resettlement  and \nenvironmental impacts5 and related costs were important considerations that eliminated the \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n5  The Taoshan and Xiquanan reservoir sites had an estimated 20,000 and 18,000 persons to be resettled, \nrespectively. ", "4 \nother alternatives. The option of tapping the Lalin River downstream (closer to Harbin) was \nrejected due to the freezing of that portion of the river during the winter. Use of the water of the \nSonghua River was reviewed during the project preparatory TA. The consultants concluded that \nthe  minimum  facility  to  meet  national  treated  water  standards6  would  be  advanced  water \ntreatment (AWT).7 However, there is uncertainty as to the extent to which AWT could remove the \ntrace  organic  chemicals  from  Songhua  water.  Also,  the  use  of  breakpoint  chlorination  for \nammonia  removal  with  AWT  could  create  a  health  risk  from  other  potentially  hazardous \nchemicals released into the drinking water during treatment. Following the completion of the TA, \nADB contracted an independent consultant to undertake a peer review desk study of the \nconclusions of the government study and the TA report on the treatability of the Songhua River. \nThe peer review desk study confirmed the assessment of the TA consultants. \n13.  Given the significant health risks and uncertainty related to continued reliance on the \nexisting  river  water  source  and  in  accordance  with  internationally  accepted  engineering \npractices, the proposed Project involves the development of a new water source from the Lalin \nRiver while actions are under way to clean up the Songhua River. The Project is consistent with \nADB strategy in the PRC water supply and wastewater sector. The Project (i) will help avoid a \ndeficit in supply capacity, estimated to be 450,000 m3/day, and (ii) of the total population of \n889,000 below the ADB urban poverty line will (a) connect 100,000 poor city residents to the \nmunicipal water supply system and (b) normalize supply to another 225,000 poor residents who \nsuffer from low pressure. With the Project, groundwater use will be reduced to sustainable levels \nand wells will be placed on standby status to meet maximum daily and emergency demands.  \n3.   People\u2019s Republic of China River Basin Management \n14.  ADB has been involved in the formulation of the PRC water law (amended in 2002), \nwhich  provides  a  better  framework  for  strengthening  river  basin  management and water \nconservation and managing pollution. An ongoing ADB cluster TA8 is assisting the Government \nin operationalizing transjurisdictional provisions of the Water Pollution Prevention and Control \nAct. The other objectives are to help the Government (i) strengthen environmental management \nof  the  Huang  River  basin  by  developing  transjurisdictional  administration,  environmental \nstandards  and  regulations,  and  environmental  monitoring  and  enforcement  mechanisms; \n(ii) develop local legislation and regulations for implementing the transjurisdictional provisions of \nthe Act; (iii) examine the need for a national law to integrate various dimensions of river basin \nenvironmental  management;  and  (iv) disseminate  the  findings  and  recommendations  for \npotential application in other river basins. ADB has also assisted in strengthening the Songhua \nRiver Basin Commission under the Songhua River Flood Management (Sector) Project.9 In \naddition, ADB assisted in strengthening the PRC\u2019s policies and strategies for water resources by \nassessing the strategic options for the water sector.10 The study reviewed and recommended \n                                                 \n6  PRC\u2019s drinking water standards are different from that of the US Environmental Protection Agency, and are more \nstringent than in some countries. ADB standard practice, supported by the World Health Organization\u2019s policy, is \nthat national/local laws, recommendations, and guidelines override international or other countries\u2019 norms.  \n7  The economic net present value (NPV) of costs of the Project is $343.2 million. The costs for abstraction from the \nSonghua River with AWT are estimated to be between $317.1 million and $339.8 million (i.e., within 1% to 8% \ndifference of the Project NPV). AWT includes pre-ozonation, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, anthracite \nfiltration ozonation, granulated activated carbon filtration, and post chlorination. \n8  ADB.  2002.

The TA for \nSonghua River Water Quality and Pollution Control Management would follow the experience of \nprevious ADB assistance to the PRC, develop currently lacking pollution control mechanisms, \nand outline a time-bound pollution control action plan. The proposed Jilin Water Supply and \nWastewater Treatment Project (2005), among others, will be able to support some of the \ninitiatives in the Songhua River basin clean-up.   \n4.  Water Tariff Reforms \n15.  During the era of the centrally planned economy, the provision of water was considered \na basic social need and was heavily subsidized by the Government. Water tariffs in many cities \nremained unchanged for 20 to 40 years. As a result (i) water supply companies (WSCs) did not \nhave sufficient financial resources to expand, or to operate and maintain existing systems in a \nfinancially sound manner; and (ii) consumers and industries had no market-oriented incentives \nto conserve water. Beginning in the mid-1980s, the need for tariff adjustments was recognized. \nUnder the Government's ongoing market-based reforms, all WSCs and new water supply \nprojects are required to be financially sustainable and capable of full cost recovery. WSCs are \nbeing  encouraged  to  corporatize  and  improve  their  cost-recovery  capability  and  financial \nsustainability. Between 1986 and 2001, there were major increases in water tariffs, averaging \n17% to 25% annually. Despite these increases, water tariffs are still relatively low.  \n16.  ADB has supported the water supply tariff reform process through two completed water \ntariff studies11 with the Ministry of Construction. The first study assisted the Government in \ndeveloping the National Guidelines on Water Tariffs (NGWT), focusing on improving the cost-\nrecovery performance of the WSCs and promoting water conservation and environmentally \nsustainable  use  of  water.  The  second  study  assisted  the  Government  in  developing  the \ninstitutional and methodological capacities to implement the NGWT tariffs and to set water \ntariffs. The impact of this TA will benefit all future ADB water supply projects in the PRC as tariff \nreforms and cost recovery are always on the policy dialogue agenda. The proposed Project is \nnoteworthy as the first major water supply development in which the NGWT and the principle of \nfunding investments directly from tariffs are being implemented in the PRC.  \n17.  Tariff  and  other  reforms  have  created  opportunities  for  the  WSCs  to  improve \nsustainability by entering into joint ventures, by creating profitable subsidiary companies, and by \nseeking private sector partners to provide technical and financial assistance to undertake capital \nprojects. However, government policy to encourage foreign investment in the sector and private \nsector participation in the water supply industry in the PRC is still at a very early stage of \ndevelopment. HMG, however, did take the initiative in searching for partners for the Project, \nalthough that effort was unsuccessful, and there remains the possibility of some private sector \nequity investment in the future.  \n5.  Lessons Learned \n18.  During project processing, lessons of experience have been addressed by (i) thoroughly \nevaluating the technical designs and technologies; (ii) ensuring an adequate debt-equity ratio for \nthe  Harbin  Municipal  Water  Supply  Construction  Company  (HMWSCC);  (iii) undertaking \nrigorous  sensitivity  analysis  of  cash  flows,  and  financial  and  economic  analysis; \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1997.

Lessons learned from ADB\u2019s postevaluation experience in water supply and sanitation \nindicate that it is necessary to integrate both supply- and demand-side concerns into project \ndesigns.  Encouraging  broad  reforms  such  as  commercial  management,  and  introducing \ncompetition will promote efficient and responsive delivery of water supply and wastewater \nservices. Appropriate pricing policies for water and sanitation services are also required. The \npolicy agenda for the Dalian Water Supply12,  Zhejiang-Shanxi Water Supply (Phase I),13 the \nFuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment,14  and Tianjin Wastewater Treatment and \nWater Resources Protection projects15 have centered around cost recovery and tariff reform, \nand water resources and wastewater management. The Dalian Water Supply Project has been \nsuccessfully completed and the Zhejiang Shanxi Water Supply Project (Phase I) is nearing \nsuccessful completion. The Dalian project has similarities to the proposed Project in terms of \nlength of raw water transmission line, average incremental economic cost and total project cost \nat appraisal.16 The June 2000 project completion report rated the Dalian project17 as generally \nsuccessful and the key success factor was the strong ownership of the project by the local \ngovernment.18 The Zhejiang project involved a larger dam than the proposed Project and \nsignificantly  more  resettlement.  With  close  supervision  of  ADB  through  an  independent \ninternational dam panel and a resettlement monitoring panel, both the dam construction and the \nresettlement have been successfully completed. Lessons learned are reflected in the design of \nthe proposed Harbin Project.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n20.  The main objectives of the Project are to (i) alleviate the current water shortage and \nwater quality problems in Harbin and meet future water demands; (ii) improve long-term public \nhealth  by  providing  safe  water;  (iii) promote  long-term  urban  development  in  Harbin  City; \n(iv) provide institutional strengthening of HMWSCC and HMTWC for efficient and effective O&M \nof the new system; and (v) assure tariff reforms to achieve full cost recovery.  \nB.  Components and Outputs \n21.  The Project has four physical components, comprising: (i) a 45-meter (m) high dam at \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 1994.

Manila. \n16 HMG and HMWSCC and the concerned design institutes have undertaken several detailed field visits to Dalian to \ndiscuss technical and other aspects of project implementation and incorporated the lessons learned in the design \nof the proposed Project. \n17 The Dalian Water Supply Project was picked as a case study for a successfully implemented project under RETA \n6022: Impact Evaluation Study of Water Supply and Sanitation Projects in Selected DMCs. \n18 The proposed Project also has very strong ownership at the local government level and strong support at \nprovincial and central government levels. ", "7 \nMopanshan on the Lalin River, having a reservoir volume of 356 million m3, a diversion tunnel, \nand river outlet works, a water intake tower and raw water supply tunnel, and a gated spillway; \n(ii) a raw water pipeline of 2,200\u20132,400 millimeter (mm)  diameter and 175.5 km length from \nMopanshan dam to the city; (iii) a water treatment plant of 450,000 m3/day capacity; and \n(iv) expansion and rehabilitation of the water distribution network, consisting of 73.8 km of trunk \nmains ranging in diameter from 300 mm to 1,800 mm,18 km of small water pipes 100\u2013250 mm \nin diameter, and separation valves. In a possible second phase to be evaluated in 2007 for \ndevelopment from 2010, a parallel raw water pipeline could be built, the water treatment plant \nexpanded by an additional 450,000 m3/day, and further distribution improvements made. The \nreservoir will have capacity to provide an additional 450,000 m3/day in a future phase, sufficient \nto  meet  the  demands  for  water  through  2019.  A  panel  of  international  technical  experts \n(Supplementary Appendix A) will be established to independently monitor the detailed designs \nand construction of the dam, with particular emphasis on safety and quality control.19 \n22.  The feasibility study report defines the domestic and industrial water supply zones for \nthe Project water source and existing water treatment plants, and accordingly develops a \ndetailed plan for modification and rehabilitation of the distribution system including locations, \npipe sizes, and ground conditions with the pipelines designated for either domestic or industrial \nuse. The proposed Project includes rehabilitation of 91 km of the domestic distribution network, \nand will provide water supply to the residential areas of Harbin City. The industrial areas will be \nsupplied by the existing water treatment plants. With the above actions and the introduction of \nseparation actions and control including separation valves to be completed by 2007, the project \nwater quality will be maintained. The proposed Project will serve about 53% of domestic water \nand other nonindustrial demands in Harbin in 2008.  \n23.  Hydrological  and  river  flow  data  collected  over  the  past  several  years  confirm  the \nadequacy of flow in the Lalin River, which drains into the Songhua River about 150 km upstream \nfrom Harbin City. Aside from irrigation diversion weirs, there are no reservoirs or hydraulic \ncontrols  on  the  Lalin  main  stem  before  the  Songhua.  Extensive  geological  investigations \nincluded (i) test holes and drill cores to confirm the subsurface conditions at the dam sites, and \n(ii) analysis of rock formations at the entrance and exit of the water conveyance tunnel for the \nMopanshan dam. The ADB-required, internationally accepted simulation of flood control and \nconservation systems, HEC-5 model was used to verify the targets set in the feasibility study \nreport for water supply, irrigation, and flood control.  The report incorporated the major dam \ndesign comments provided by the TA consultants, particularly regarding peak flood flows. The \nTA studies confirmed the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed investments. The \n45 m high dam will provide the storage capacity to alleviate flood-drought cycles and provide \nwater to meet the year-round water demands of both Harbin City and downstream residents. \nThe operating rules for conservation storage  have been defined.  \n24.  There are some settlements within the Lalin catchment area. The largest, Wuchang City, \nis  the  county  seat  of  Wuchang  County,  with  a  population  of  about  50,000.  Two  smaller \ntownships,  Xiangyang  and  Shahezi,  are  near  the  Lalin  River  between  the  dam  site  and \nWuchang  City.  These  settlements  are  susceptible  to  flooding  about  once  every  3  years. \nAgricultural land near the river was flooded three times during the summer of 2002. The land \ndownstream from the dam site is relatively flat rainfed agricultural land on rich black soil. Hills \nalong the periphery of the watershed support forestry, which also predominates within the \n                                                 \n19   The Dam Panel for the Project will include (i) dam engineer with experience in rock-and earth-fill clay-core dams, \n(ii) geologist with expertise in rock cuts and tunneling, (iii) geotechnical engineer with expertise in foundation \nengineering and embankment design of gravity dams, and (iv) expert in hydrology and hydraulic analysis and \ndesign of spillways, outlet works, and control structures. ", "8 \nproject watershed area. After resettlement of 6,022 persons, the project watershed area would \ncontain an estimated population of 13,000 people engaged in agriculture and forestry, at 10 to \n12 forestry stations, at a density of only 12 persons per km2. In contrast, the density for the \nSonghua River basin as a whole is 105 persons per km2. Allocation of project water between \nsectors will be determined by the Harbin Water Authority on behalf of the Ministry of Water \nResources and HMG and most of the water will go to supply Harbin water.  UFW is currently \nrecorded at 20%. This will be reduced by (i) an HMTWC program for replacement of old water \nmains, (ii) installation of new water mains and rehabilitation of the distribution system under the \nProject, and (iii) the short length of pipe per capita.  \nC.  Special Features \n25.  The  Project  supports  and  strengthens  several  ADB  policy  initiatives:  (i) poverty \nreduction;  (ii) cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform;  (ii) adoption  of  water  purchase  agreements; \n(iii) wastewater  management;  (iv) upstream  pollution  prevention  and  control;  (v) water \nconservation;  (vi) regulatory  enforcement  and  monitoring;  (vii) corporate  governance  and \nenterprise reform; (viii) private sector participation; and (ix) watershed management. The policy \ndialogue agenda is in Appendix 5.20 \n26.  The funding of the Project directly from tariffs (about $70 million) is a major reform in line \nwith the ADB water policy21 and will have a demonstration impact in the PRC and elsewhere. \nThe two completed water tariff studies (footnote 11) have had a significant impact on tariff \nreforms and implementation of the NGWT in Harbin. The tariff increase in the last 2 years has \ncontributed to effective demand management, water conservation, and recycling of industrial \nwater. ADB involvement in the Project, with the committed water tariff increases, should have a \ncatalytic effect in attracting private sector participation in the future.  \n27.  Based on the social assessment and poverty impact analysis, the project design was \nadjusted to give significant poverty reduction effects through (i) increased water supplies in poor \nareas  where  supply  is  now  limited;  (ii) adopting  and  maintaining  lifeline  tariffs  for  poor \nconsumers; and (iii) employment generation during project implementation and operation. The \nplanned water supply improvement program will benefit 325,000 poor22 with an annual per \ncapita income below the ADB operational urban poverty line of CNY3,300 per year. In Harbin, \nthose  living  below  the  poverty  line  have  been  exempted  from  the  December  2001  tariff \nincreases. This will be extended and  HMG will implement a poverty intervention program \nincluding (i) waiving of future tariff increases for the poorest households, and (ii) connecting the \npoorest households to tap water in five districts23 in Harbin. Under the poverty intervention \nprogram, pipeline connection fees will not be charged to the poor households, resulting in total \nsavings of over CNY16 million to the poor beneficiaries.24 Further, each poor household will be \nprovided with a water meter free of charge representing an additional saving of CNY80 per \nhousehold. The Project includes an assurance covering the implementation of the poverty \nintervention  program.  The  project  framework  (Appendix  1)  includes  a  set  of  measurable \nindicators that were developed based on the project design, impacts, and risks.  The ADB loan \n                                                 \n20 This appendix also includes a history and future prospects of private sector participation for the Project. \n21 The  cumulative  effect  of  the  June  2000  (34%)  and  the  December  2001  (26%)  increases  (CNY1.3/m3  to \nCNY1.8/m3) was to raise average tariffs by 68%. About 60% of the December 2001 increase would accumulate in \na special fund that would be used to finance the Project.  \n22 About 225,000 people presently suffer from low pressure and 100,000 poor people have no access to tap water. \n23 Dongli, Dongfeng, Pingfang, Wanggang, and Xinxiangfang. \n24 The cost will be covered by the annual budget allocation for improvement of water services from the Harbin Water \nConservancy Bureau. ", "9 \nimplementation consultants will carry out the monitoring during the project implementation \nperiod. Monitoring procedures for the postproject implementation period will be developed by \nthe implementation consultants and implemented by HMWSCC.  \n28.  To safeguard the quality of water released from the project reservoir and to prevent \npollution in the upstream part of the Lalin River system, the Lalin River Water Resource \nProtection  Committee  will  be  established  by  February  2003  to  coordinate  and  facilitate \nenvironmental monitoring and mitigation and to address the interests of stakeholders before, \nduring, and after project implementation. Plans include (i) closing off the reservoir to the general \npublic, and (ii) restricting access to its catchment area to prevent any pollution entering the \nwater system in the upstream part.25 Part of the reservoir will be classified as a nature reserve, \nand there are concrete plans to reestablish some of the indigenous mixed forests around the \nreservoir. The Committee will increase environmental awareness in the project area, develop \ncooperation between various regional stakeholders by sharing data, and provide a forum for \ndiscussion of environmental issues not related to the Project. The Committee will be chaired by \nthe mayor of Harbin, and consist of members of concerned provincial and municipal bureaus, \nHMWSCC, and civil society. The Committee will gradually expand the area of its expertise to the \nwhole of the Lalin River basin, turning into a coordination and decision-making mechanism for \nthe  full  scope  of  issues  related  to  water  resources  management  and  environmental \nconservation. The Committee will serve as an example for the other sub-basins of the Songhua \nRiver, contributing to developing the sustained  effort of cleaning up pollution and promoting \nenvironmentally sustained water resources and environmental management of the Songhua \nRiver basin. A particularly important initiative that is under way is the preparation of the Songhua \nPollution Control Plan  prepared over 2 years by the Heilongjiang Environmental Protection \nBureau, the Songliao River Basin Commission, and SEPA. The Plan will follow a similar format \nand structure to the Hai River Pollution Control and Prevention Plan developed with assistance \nof the ADB advisory TA on Hai River Wastewater Management and Pollution Control.26 The \nSonghua  River  Water  Quality  and  Pollution  Control  Management  TA  will  provide  the \nGovernment with similar assistance. Further, the comprehensive geographic information system \nof the Songhua River basin being prepared under the Songhua River Flood Management \n(Sector) Project will provide inputs to the Government\u2019s Songhua Pollution Control Plan. The \nimplementation of this Plan will be monitored during construction of the Project.  \nD.  Cost Estimates \n29.  The total project cost is $399.5 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange cost of \n$100 million (25%) and a local currency cost of $299.5 million equivalent (75%).

The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years. \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total  Total \nSources  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percentage \n         \nAsian Development Bank Loan  100.0    0  100.0  25 \nCounterpart Funds         \nHarbin Municipal Government Equity    0  119.9  119.9  30 \nCommercial Cofinancing         \nDomestic Loans     0  179.6  179.6  45 \nSubtotal Financed by Counterparts   0  299.5  299.5  75 \n         \nTotal Cost to be Financed  100.0  299.5  399.5  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n31.  The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The Borrower will be the Government of \nthe PRC, which will relend to the Heilongjiang provincial government (HPG). HPG will onlend to \n                                                 \n27 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Bank of China (BOC) have already issued their official letters \nof commitment for the domestic loans as required by the State Development Planning Commission. The loans \ncarry an interest rate of 6.1% per annum with a maturity of 11 years, including a grace period of 4 years. ", "11 \nHMG, which will onlend to HMWSCC. All onlending will be on the same terms and conditions as \nthe ADB loan. HMWSCC will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks for \nADB\u2019s loan. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n32.  The Executing Agency will be HMG.  A project leading group has been established, \nheaded by the mayor of Harbin and comprising the heads of relevant HMG departments. The \nproject leading group will provide overall policy direction and guidance. HMWSCC will be the \nimplementing agency. Within HMWSCC, a project management office has been established and \na project director has been appointed. HMWSCC is a limited  liability company incorporated \nunder  PRC  company  law  with  an  initial  registered  capital  of  CNY200 million  ($24 million). \nAccording to the company\u2019s articles of association, its primary business is the development, \nconstruction, and management of the Project. A board of directors will oversee financial and \noperational  matters  of  the  company  including  (i) hiring/firing  of  senior  management; \n(ii) reviewing staffing and remuneration plans; (iii) reviewing the progress of construction and \napproving annual construction plans; (iv) reviewing and approving annual financial budgets; \n(v) reviewing  the  investment  plans  and  accounts  of  the  company;  and  (vi) approving the \nprocurement of major equipment and civil works contracts. HMWSCC will increase its staff from \nits present 32 to about 80 for the construction period and to about 382 when operations begin. \nThe internal controls and accounting and auditing procedures of HMWSCC are generally in \norder and will be fully functional and available for use under the Project. An assessment was \nundertaken of HMWSCC\u2019s technical and institutional capacities, which are adequate for project \nimplementation. Since the chairperson of HMWSCC is also a former vice mayor of HMG, \nHMWSCC has high-level support in HMG and is well positioned to implement the Project. The \norganization of HMWSCC is given in Appendix 7.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n33.  The Project will be constructed over a period of 5 years from 2003 to the end of 2007 \n(Appendix 8). This schedule is considered realistic because the project implementation structure \nis already in place, and preparatory works are under way. ADB\u2019s successful experience in \nsimilar projects in the PRC and HMG\u2019s in-depth knowledge and experience in water supply \nprojects indicates that this schedule is achievable. \n3.  Procurement \n34.  Equipment, materials, goods, and services financed by ADB\u2019s loan will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Procurement  and  follow  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) for packages each with a value greater than $0.5 million. \nPackages  valued  $500,000  or  less  will  be  procured  following  international  shopping  (IS) \nprocedures and packages at $100,000 and less will be procured following local competitive \nbidding (LCB) or direct purchase procedures. Indicative procurement packages are listed in \nAppendix 9. The locally procured materials, and civil works contracts estimated to cost below \n$5 million per package, will follow local competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the ", "12 \nPRC\u2019s  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  and  the  respective  procurement  regulations.28  Major \nequipment will be purchased through ICB procedures and financed by the ADB loan. The \ninternationally tendered equipment packages will include the necessary technical support for \nensuring proper installation, testing, commissioning, and training of operational staff as part of \nthe related contracts. In accordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate \nin the bidding for LCB contracts.  \n35.  The Government requested, and ADB approved, advance action to expedite project \nimplementation. Advance action, which may take place prior to loan effectiveness, includes \n(i) prequalification  of  contractors,  tendering,  and  bid  evaluation  for  civil  works  contract \npackages; and (ii) preparation of tender documents for the procurement of materials, plant, \nequipment, and vehicles. HMWSCC was advised that issuance of invitations to bid or to \nprequalify under advance procurement action was subject to approval by ADB. All advance \nprocurement actions will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. \nThe Government and HMWSCC were advised that approval of advance action does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n36.  The Government is increasingly concerned with governance issues and has conducted \nwell-publicized  campaigns  against  corruption  involving  use  of  public  funds.  During  project \nprocessing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local government officials. \nAttention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors to observe the \nhighest standards of ethics in the procurement and execution of the ADB-financed contracts, \nand the sanctions to be applied if fraud and corruption are discovered. The anticorruption \nprovisions added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed. ADB provided \nTAs to draft procurement regulations and standard bidding documents.29  \n4.  Consulting Services \n37.  Consulting services will be required to (i) build the capacity of the staff of HMWSCC; \n(ii) monitor dam construction and operations; and (iii) monitor resettlement. The consultants will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.30  Provision has \nbeen  made  for  62  person-months  of  international  and  130  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services to be funded under the loan, to support HMWSCC in project implementation \nand capacity building. These tasks include (i) reviewing designs, specifications, and tender \ndocuments; (ii) construction supervision, quality control of concrete-faced, rock-filled dams and \nrelated monitoring of progress over the project implementation period; (iii) training to HMWSCC \nin finance, accounting,  mechanics, and O&M, including leakage detection; (iv) developing a \nmanagement  information  system  for  HMWSCC;  (v) social  and  environmental  monitoring; \n(vi) undertaking a midterm and final review of project tariffs and impact on retail tariffs based on \nactual  investment  cost;  (vii) providing  advice  to  HMTWC  on  performance  improvements \nincluding management of nonrevenue  water; and (viii) monitoring of dam construction and \nresettlement (the outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix A).  \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n30 The selection of consultants will employ the quality and cost-based selection method. This will involve the \nsimultaneous submission of technical and financial proposals and the use of price as an evaluation criterion.  ", "13 \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n38.  To make adequate amounts of the loan proceeds available on a timely basis for the \nProject, an imprest account will be established by Heilongjiang Provincial Finance Bureau after \nloan effectiveness in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). \nDisbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal \napplication and related documentation. Such documentation will demonstrate, among other \nthings, that the goods and/or services were (i) produced in and procured from ADB's members \nand (ii) eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will \nnot exceed 6-month estimated expenditure for the Project or 10% of the loan amount, whichever \nis  lower.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \nexpenditures and to liquidate advances in amounts not exceeding $200,000 equivalent per item \nof expenditure.  \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n39.  Sound  auditing  is  an  important  element  of  good  governance  and  an  important \nanticorruption measure. ADB is helping strengthen the PRC auditing system. HMWSCC will \nmaintain records adequate to identify goods and services financed out of the loan proceeds \nfollowing accounting principles and practices as prescribed by the Accounting Law of the PRC. \nThe Accounting Law requires enterprises to prepare financial statements and generally follow \ninternationally  accepted  accounting  standards.  HMWSCC  will  maintain  separate  project \naccounts  and  records.  The  financial  statements  of  the  project  accounts  and  the  annual \ncorporate financial statements for HMWSCC will be subject to external audit by the Harbin \nMunicipal  Audit  Bureau,  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Audit  Bureau,  and  the  State  Audit \nAdministration. The audits will be carried out in accordance with the regulations for auditing \napproved by the State Council in 1993 and will meet ADB\u2019s requirements. The project-audited \naccounts will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year for the \nentire implementation period plus 3 years after completion of the Project. The Government, \nHMG, and HMWSCC have been informed about ADB's policy on submission of audited financial \nstatements and possible penalties for delays in submission.  \n40.  HMWSCC will submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use of the loan \nproceeds,  project  implementation,  and  HMWSCC  performance.  The  reports  will  include \n(i) quarterly progress reports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports; and (iii) a project \ncompletion report, not later than 3 months after completion of the project facilities. Progress \nreports will emphasize progress made in the areas of policy dialogue, including (i) water supply \ntariff changes, (ii) environmental and water quality monitoring, (iii) resettlement, (iv) social and \npoverty reduction aspects, and (v) capacity building and financial management of HMWSCC. \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n41.  At the beginning of the Project, HMWSCC, with the assistance of consultants, will \ndevelop  comprehensive  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  procedures  to \ngenerate systematic data on inputs and outputs of the Project and the indicators to be used to \nmeasure project impacts. Indicators that have been agreed during project preparation include \nservice levels, nonrevenue water, water conservation, treated water quality, and other measures \nof operational performance; user satisfaction; relevant economic data to monitor project impacts \non improved living conditions and economic opportunities; number of connections provided to \nthe poor; and number of people benefiting from lifeline tariffs. These relate to (i) improved water \nsupply  and  sewerage  treatment  facilities  and  services,  (ii) improved  quality  of  life, ", "14 \n(iii) resettlement, (iv) physical completion, (v) institutional strengthening, and (vi) policy reforms. \nThe Project provides a budget for baseline and follow-up socioeconomic surveys (Appendix 6) \nin  years  three,  four,  and  five  of  the  project  construction  period  to  collect  the  necessary \ninformation on the target population (disaggregated by poor/nonpoor status) so that coverage of \nthe  poor  is  monitored  against  the  baseline  survey  data  as  the  new  water  is  distributed \nthroughout the project area. HMWSCC will refine the PPMS framework, confirm achievable \ngoals, firm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and procedures \nno  later  than  6  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  HMWSCC,  with  the  assistance  of  the \nconsultants, will monitor and assess activities, and report to ADB quarterly on the physical \nimplementation, resettlement, environment, social and poverty, and financial aspects of the \nProject to ensure that impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements.  \n8.  Project Review \n42.  Besides  regular  ADB  review  missions,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a \nmidterm review, 2 years after project implementation begins. This review will include a detailed \nevaluation of the scope, implementation arrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled \ntargets, and progress on the agenda for policy reform and capacity-building measures. A review \nof retail water tariffs in Harbin City will also be undertaken.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n43.  The Project will avoid water shortages and provide a safe clean source of water for \nHarbin, which presently relies on the heavily polluted Songhua River. In 2001, the five existing \nwater works in Harbin operated over the year at 88% of capacity, and customer water demands \ncould  not  be  met  during  peak  demand  periods.  Individual  facilities  operated  at  up  to  an \nunsustainable 118% of capacity on a monthly basis. Under the Project, the water supply will be \nincreased by 450,000 m3/day, sufficient to meet maximum daily water demands after 2007. The \nproposed Mopanshan reservoir will provide sufficient yield to support future development of an \nadditional 450,000 m3/day, which will meet forecast demands through 2019. When the project \nwater starts to flow in 2008, separation of the distribution system will be completed, so that the \ndam water will supply the residential areas, and the Songhua River will serve the industrial \nareas. The proposed Project will serve 53% of domestic and other nonindustrial demands in \nHarbin in 2008.  \n44.  Pollution in the Songhua River has reduced the existing raw water quality to less than \nthe required Class III standard, and has  placed the population at risk from dangerous trace \norganic chemicals31 discharged upstream from Harbin that cannot be removed by the existing \nHarbin water treatment works. The Project will provide Harbin with a clean source of water \nsupply, which will significantly improve the reliability and safety of the domestic water supply. \nMinimum flows from the dam will be no less than at present. \nB.  Institutional Strengthening \n45.  Significant consultant advisory services will be provided to develop HMWSCC such that \nit will (i) be a properly constituted enterprise company, established under the provisions of PRC \n                                                 \n31 The Ministry of Public Health has issued drinking water standards covering trace organic chemicals. ", "15 \nlaw, and managerially and financially autonomous; (ii) act as a the project implementing agency, \nworking and liaising closely with the various departments and agencies of local government; \n(iii) assume  management  responsibility  for  future  O&M  of  project  facilities,  including \nresponsibility for debt servicing and the repayment of loan principal; and (iv) assume ownership \nof all project assets. These services can also be extended to include HMTWC, which will \npurchase project water and supply water at a retail level in the city. \nC.  Social Dimensions \n1.   Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n46.  The Land Administration Law (articles 48 and 49) requires disclosure and consultation \nwith affected persons (APs). The public consultation process for the Project began in 1997 with \nthe initial asset inventory survey by the Hydraulic Design Institute. The Project has been \npublicized to the local population through the mass media, including local television. During \nproject processing, site reconnaissance and surveys of affected households, host villages, \nvillage leaders, township leaders, and the project beneficiaries were completed. The public \nconsultation process confirmed that the Project was welcomed by the local beneficiaries and \nmany of the resettlers, who see relocation as the best way to improve their current living \nstandards. \n47.  The construction of the Project will affect 1,740 households or 6,022 persons by land \nacquisition and resettlement. In total, 3,110 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired permanently \nand 650 ha temporarily. The total cost for both land acquisition and resettlement is estimated to \nbe  CNY504.6 million  ($61.0 million).32  Resettlement  impacts  have  been  identified  and  a \nresettlement action plan (RAP; Supplementary Appendix C) and a summary RAP (Appendix 10) \nhave  been  prepared,  addressing  issues  related  to  entitlements  of  APs.  The  resettlement \ninformation booklet (RIB) has been distributed to the APs, via village offices. The final revised \nRAP reflects feedback received. The full RAPs in Chinese and English have been posted at \nvillage offices. The RAP and the summary RAP have been posted on ADB's resettlement web \nsite. Resettlement supervision milestones have been prepared to closely monitor progress on \nthe resettlement actions. The Government, HMG, and HMWSCC will ensure that all APs are \ncompensated in a timely manner and resettled in accordance with the RAP so that they will be \nat least as well off as they would have been without the Project. A mechanism was built for \nfurther consultation with APs throughout the resettlement process. There will be minimal effect \non  indigenous  people  or  ethnic  minorities.  The  Project  includes  careful  monitoring  of  the \nresettlement  component  by  using  independent  international  experts  to  undertake  annual \nreviews  and  report  to  ADB.  ADB  consulting  services  include  a  3-year  resettlement  panel \ncomprising two international and one domestic resettlement monitors (a total of 8 person-\nmonths), who will visit the site yearly to review the progress made, the general welfare of those \nresettled, make recommendations to resolve any issues and support the training programs. The \nadvisors will pay special attention to programs to help APs experiencing difficulties in regaining \ntheir preproject standards of living and report progress to HMWSCC, which will forward a copy \nto ADB.  \n2.  Poverty Reduction \n48.  ADB completed a study on urban poverty in the PRC33 using income and expenditure \n                                                 \n32 The substantial costs dedicated to resettlement clearly demonstrate the Government\u2019s strong commitment to \nminimizing problems associated with resettlement. \n33 ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to People\u2019s Republic of China for Urban Poverty Study. Manila. ", "16 \ndata to determine poverty lines for all provinces and major cities. Using the ADB urban poverty \noperational poverty line of CNY3,300 per capita per year, an estimated 32% of the urban \npopulation to be served by the Project fall below the poverty line. There will be a wider impact, \nsince the beneficiaries also include 35,000 farmers potentially less susceptible to crop damage \nfrom floodwaters. The Project will improve the health and well-being of beneficiaries through \nimproved water supply. The poor are more susceptible to health problems because of poor diets \nand less ability to pay for preventive and curative measures against disease. Women will benefit \nas homemakers from a reduction of pollution-induced illnesses among family members, and \nfrom a healthier safer environment in which to raise children. HMG will provide a (i) social \ndevelopment fund for women-headed and vulnerable households; (ii) implement a community \nawareness and participation program that prioritizes women; and (iii) give special preference to \nwomen for project-related employment and training. The Project will also create construction job \nopportunities for both skilled and unskilled labor during the implementation stage. The Project \nwill create a minimum of 800 permanent jobs for the operation of the facilities, and 3,500 jobs \nduring the construction period. The results of the poverty impact assessment are in Appendix \n11.  \n49.  The poverty impact analysis established that (i) based on the population census, about \n32% of the target population will be poor households, which is higher than the national urban \npoverty incidence (9%); (ii) the poverty impact ratio is 36%; and (iii) for the poor who cannot \nafford to access the water supply, new connections will be made available, tariffs will not be \nraised, and piping and meters will be installed free of charge. The poor benefiting from free \nmeters and new water supply connections constitute 11.1% of total beneficiaries. Likewise, the \npoor benefiting from fixed tariff charges account for 16.7% of total beneficiaries. A benefit \ndistribution and poverty impact analysis was carried out to compute the poverty impact ratio of \nthe Project (see Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix D). The share of net project benefits \ndirectly accruing  to the poor is estimated at 36%. Through an assurance and monitoring \nmechanisms, the poor households who constitute 32% (889,000 people) will have access to the \nproject water and could be eligible for subsidy assistance if they cannot afford access. \nD.  Financial Aspects   \n50.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  estimated  at  6.0%,  which  compares \nfavorably with the weighted average cost of capital in real terms of 4.4%. Tariff increases are \nrequired to ensure the financial sustainability of HMWSCC. The sensitivity analysis included \nexamination of the risk that costs would increase by 20%, or that revenues would be 24% less \nthan anticipated; the resulting FIRRs are 3.6% and 2.3%, respectively. Detailed verification of \nthe local financing plan indicated that the equity contribution from the city is about 1% of annual \nrevenues,  indicating  minimal  risk.  HMG  has  sufficient  financial  resources  to  take  on \nresponsibility  for  guaranteeing  the  loan  repayments,  and  has  provided  assurances  that  it \naccepts this risk. \n51.  An affordability analysis has been undertaken, based on proposed tariffs and household \nincome data from the social survey. Tariffs under the Project are considered affordable if the \ncombined average water and wastewater charges are less than 5% of household income. The \nestimated tariffs on this basis are affordable to the average household (less than 1% of income), \nand affordable to the poorest 10% of households (less than 3% of income). The risk that the \nproposed tariffs are not affordable is minimal, since the tariffs are within the affordability limit by \na sufficient margin to allow for future wastewater tariffs. \n52.  The financial sustainability of the Project was verified through the financial analysis of ", "17 \nHMWSCC and secured through the signed water purchase agreement (WPA) with HMTWC. \nThe financial projections for HMWSCC indicate that the minimum debt service coverage ratios \nand acceptable rates of return on equity included as loan covenants will be achieved by the \nProject. To ensure that the Project does not have an adverse fiscal impact on any level of \ngovernment, wholesale and retail tariffs were structured on the basis of achieving full cost \nrecovery for the Project. The overall fiscal impact resulting from the Project is expected to be \npositive,  since  various  levels  of  government,  including  HMG, are investors in the Project. \nHowever, the shareholders and subsequently the guarantor of the ADB loan are assuming some \nfinancial risk during construction and the first few years of production. Based on the financial \nanalysis these risks are manageable (Supplementary Appendix E). \nE.  Economic Aspects \n53.  The economic analysis was conducted for a 30-year period inclusive of the project \nconstruction period, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. \nProject benefits and costs were estimated on a without- and with-project basis appropriately \napportioned on the basis of being tradable or nontradable, and with appropriate adjustments to \nthe nonincremental and incremental project benefits. Incremental benefits were valued on the \nbasis of willingness to pay. An estimation of health costs was undertaken and the effects of \nincluding relevant benefits are shown as incremental benefits.  \n54.  A least-cost analysis comparing the Project with treatment of the Songhua River water to \nmake its water at least comparable to the Project was performed.34 This showed that AWT by \nitself would have cost 8% less than the Project. The peer review desk study estimated AWT \ncosts to be 1% less than the Project. However, there is uncertainty over the extent to which \nAWT water would still contain trace organic chemicals as indicated by the TA consultants and \nthe peer review desk study. The economic analysis is discussed further in Appendix 12, which \nshows the levels of benefits (from decreased trace organic chemicals) required to raise the \nproject economic internal rate of return (EIRR) versus AWT above 12%. Assuming that AWT \nwater is the equal in other respects to project water (which is not certain), project water would \nhave higher net benefit than AWT water if (i) people were willing to pay an additional $6 per \nperson per year with the TA consultant\u2019s estimates for AWT costs and $0.76 per person per year \nwith the peer review estimates; or (ii) it decreased annual deaths, linked to consumption of the \nriver water, by between 2% and 12%. \n55.  The EIRR of the Mopanshan system, including any benefits observed by consumers and \nfor which they are willing to pay, is estimated at 12.6%. If only the benefits from decreased \nhealth risks to served persons to 2015 are included, the EIRR would increase to 18.2%. \nSensitivity analysis indicates that the Project is slightly more sensitive to changes in benefits \nthan costs. \nF.  Environmental Aspects \n56.  An environment impact assessment (EIA) report for the Project was approved by SEPA \non 19 July 2002. The summary EIA was circulated to the ADB Board on 29 July 2002.The EIA \nconcluded that the most adverse project impact would be the resettlement of approximately \n6,022 people. A comprehensive RAP has been prepared to mitigate this impact. Impacts on \nfisheries, reservoir operation due to sedimentation, water quality, reservoir and river hydrology, \n                                                 \n34 The project proponents believe that Songhua River should not be used to provide additional drinking water to \nHarbin until it is cleaned of pollutants. The TA study, and the subsequent desk study, confirm that even AWT could \nnot guarantee complete removal of trace organic chemicals. ", "18 \nthe Sanjiang wetlands downstream from the project area, and terrestrial ecology were among \nother major potential impacts investigated during the EIA study. Reservoir water quality will be \nwithin acceptable ranges for municipal water supply (Class I and II) and strict limits will be \nplaced on the use of the reservoir to ensure the level of water quality required to meet the water \nsupply objectives. The loss of ecological resources from inundation (about 3 km2) is considered \ninsignificant  since  the  biological  resources  of  the  region  are  confined  to  higher-ground \nelevations in the watershed. The natural fish population of the Lalin River has already been \ndepleted by overfishing. No significant habitats or species will be damaged or threatened by the \nProject. \n57.  Other  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment  will  be  minimal  and  will  be  mitigated. \nImplementation of the Project, together with the planned remedial measures, will have relatively \ninsignificant adverse environmental impacts. Adequate environmental mitigation and monitoring \nmeasures have been included in the project design. A comprehensive monitoring program has \nbeen prepared that will be guided and implemented by a leading team for environmental \nprotection and an environmental monitoring office located at the project site. These offices will \ncoordinate  with,  and  complement,  activities normally undertaken by existing environmental \nmonitoring offices, especially the local environment protection bureaus. HMWSCC will prepare a \nspecific environmental management plan for mitigation to be approved by ADB during the \ninception mission.  \nG.  Project Risks \n58.  The Project does not have any unusual technical risks. The main dam is 45 m high and \nthe earth-fill dam design is a sound and well-proven technology, with a high safety factor against \nfailure. The Design Institute and the domestic project consultants have extensive experience \nwith this type of dam. The TA international dam specialist concurred with the basic design. A \npanel of technical experts will be engaged by HMWSCC to conduct annual reviews on the \ntechnical aspects of implementation with provision of regular progress reports to ADB and \nHMWSCC throughout the 5-year construction period. The mechanical and electrical equipment \nassociated with the Project are conventional and manufacturers/suppliers will be prequalified. \nThe  ICB  equipment  package  will  include  technical  support  for  installation,  testing,  and \ncommissioning as recommended by the manufacturer. In addition to the panel of technical \nexperts, internationally experienced consultants will support project implementation. Based on \nthe performance of ADB\u2019s PRC portfolio, cost overruns and major implementation delays are not \nexpected.  \n59.  Potential risks in developing a strong water supply utility include (i) future constraints on \ninstitutional reforms, and (ii) lack of adequate public support to increase water supply tariffs to \nmeet cost-recovery targets. These risks have been mitigated by (i) assurances from HMG on \nthe financial and managerial autonomy of HMWSCC; and (ii) the diversity and frequency of \npublic participation conducted to date, which HMWSCC is committed to continue, in combination \nwith regular tariff reviews and oversight of local price bureaus. \n60.  Potential financial and commercial risks related to the project include (i) failure to meet \nthe cash/equity transfers required to construct the Project; (ii) failure of HMTWC to honor the \nWPA; (iii) constraints on institutional reform of HMWSCC; and (iv) failure  by  HMWSCC  to \nincrease the tariffs to meet cost-recovery targets. The potential financial and policy risks will be \nmitigated by assurances related to the financial and managerial autonomy for HMWSCC. ADB \nreview  missions  will  monitor  HMWSCC\u2019s  compliance  with  the  financial  and  operational \ncovenants to ensure its financial sustainability. The risks associated with lack of local funding ", "19 \nwill be addressed by having HMG pass a resolution that it would (i) meet whatever cost \nincreases are incurred and (ii) provide a guarantee on the required equity injections to meet the \nfinancing requirements and financial ratios of the Project. HMWSCC will provide assurances on \n(i) establishing a retention account to cover 4 months of operating expenditures and (ii) setting \nup a debt service account with sufficient funds to cover 4 months of debt service payments \nunder the ADB loan. Should actions in support of Songhua clean-up be delayed or unresolved \nthere is a potentially significant health risk to the population resident in the Songhua River basin. \nThis risk would be mitigated, in part, by the TA for Songhua River Water Quality and Pollution \nControl Management approved in December 2002, and regular follow-up/monitoring of the \nProject by ADB. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n61.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and HMWSCC have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:   \n(i)  The Government, through HPG and HMG, will ensure that HMWSCC will be \nmaintained as a separate legal entity with full financial and managerial autonomy \nas provided for under the relevant law in the PRC. \n(ii)  HPG, HMG, and HMWSCC will ensure that HMG and/or HMWSCC will carry out \nthe  provisions  of  the  RAP  agreed  with  ADB,  including  compensation  and \nentitlements for APs, to be implemented in accordance with all applicable laws \nand regulations and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, to ensure that the \nsocial and economic base of the APs will be restored or enhanced through the \nmitigation measures. They will ensure timely provision of counterpart funds for \nland acquisition and resettlement activities specified in the RAP, and will meet \nany  obligations  in  excess  of  the  RAP  budget  estimate  in  order  to  satisfy \nresettlement  objectives.  HMWSCC  will  ensure  that  counterpart  funds  for \ncompensation and entitlements under the RAP are fully provided directly to APs \nand the relevant village organizations prior to displacement from housing and \nprior to loss of land, livelihood, income, or other assets. \n(iii)  HMG and HMWSCC will ensure that (a) the Project is constructed and operated \nin accordance with environmental procedures and guidelines of the Government \nand ADB; (b) any adverse environmental impacts arising from the Project are \nminimized  by  implementing  the  mitigation  measures  and  environmental \nmonitoring program presented in the EIA; and (c) the implementation of the \nenvironmental monitoring program, including mitigation measures, and copies of \npermits, licenses, and clearances, is regularly reported to ADB as specified in the \nEIA, including violations of safety and environmental standards, if any, and their \ncorrection. \n(iv)  The Government, through HPG and HMG, will ensure that all local cost financing \nfrom HMWSCC shareholders, including cash injection and equity contribution is \nprovided for the Project on a timely basis to enable the full and timely completion \nof the Project. The Government, HPG, and HMG will ensure that in the event of \nany shortfall of funds or cost overruns, the HMWSCC shareholder will make \navailable such funds as are required to complete the Project. ", "20 \n(v)  In order to improve the management of wastewater generated within the urban \narea of Harbin, HMG will ensure that construction of the wastewater treatment \nplants  and  sewers  targeted  under  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005) is \ncompleted before the end of 2005. HMG and HMWSCC will ensure that the \ndistribution improvements will facilitate separation of project water from Songhua \nwater; the former will serve five urban districts for domestic and commercial \npurposes, while the latter is for industrial use.  \n(vi)  HMG and HMWSCC will provide necessary support within the framework of the \nTA for Songhua River Water Quality and Pollution Control Management, and will \nassure the disclosure of relevant environment monitoring data, including river \nwater quality and potential health risk of drinking that water, eating fish from the \nriver, and contact with the river. \n(vii)  HMG will ensure that (i) the  water users who are unable to afford the water \nsupplied from the project facilities and defined as the poorest households in the \nProject beneficiary area in accordance with the ADB urban poverty line of CNY \n3,300 per person per year, shall be exempt from the charge of any future \nincreased water tariff; (ii) that the water supply shall be connected to the poor \nhouseholds defined in accordance with the ADB Urban Poverty Line in the \ndistricts of Dongfeng, Dongli, Pingfang, Wanggang, and Xinxiangfang townships \nof  Harbin  Municipality  without  charging  connection  fees;  and  (iii)  each  poor \nhousehold defined in accordance with the ADB Urban Poverty Line shall be \nprovided water meters free of charge. \nB.  Condition for Effectiveness \n62.  Execution and delivery of an onlending agreement between HMG and HMWSCC, and \nissuance of a legal opinion on the onlending agreement by a counsel acceptable to ADB will be \na condition for effectiveness of the loan proceeds for the project component. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n63.  I am satisfied that the  proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $100,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic \nof China for the Harbin Water Supply Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with interest \nto be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreement presented to the Board. \n         TADAO CHINO \nPresident \n10 February 2003", "  Appendix 1  21 \nPROJECT  FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nSummary  Indicators/Targets \n1.

", "  Appendix 4  27 \n \nWATER SUPPLY SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Sector Profile \n \n1.  Growth in the urban population in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), from about \n190 million in 1980 to 456 million in 2000, excluding the growing \u201cfloating\u201d population, and the \nnumber of cities from 136 in 1949 to more than 600 in 2001, has posed serious challenges for \nthe supply of urban services. Rural to urban migration is expected to continue in the foreseeable \nfuture. About 700 million people, equivalent to 45% of the population, are expected to live in \ncities by 2010, which will result in rapid increases in the demand for water. An environment of \nincreasing threats of pollution to water quality will exacerbate the problem, as will a shortage of \nraw water supply in some cities, and water supply delivery capacities and wastewater treatment \nfacilities in many others.  \n2.  During the era of the centrally planned economy, the provision of water was considered \na basic social need and was heavily subsidized by the Government. Water tariffs in many cities \nremained unchanged for 20 to 40 years until, beginning in the mid-1980s, the need for tariff \nadjustments was recognized. Under the Government's ongoing market-based reforms, all water \nsupply companies (WSCs) and new water supply projects, including those dealing with raw \nwater supply delivery, are required to be financially sustainable and capable of full cost recovery. \nBetween 1986 and 2001, increases in water tariffs averaged 17\u201325% annually but, due to \nconcomitant income increases, in many if not all places tariffs remain affordable.  \n3.  The Ministry of Water Resources is responsible for the planning and administration of \nwater resources. The Ministry of Construction, through the provincial and municipal construction \ncommissions, is responsible for overseeing urban plans and investments for cities. The State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration (SEPA) plays an important role in the development of \nsound environmental practices in the PRC water sector.  \n4.  The  major  source  of  financing  continues  to  be  government  equity  and  grants \nsupplemented  by  domestic  loans  and  official  development  assistance.  To  mobilize  the \nnecessary domestic resources, the Government has created a tax-based water resources fund. \nPrivate sector participation in the water supply industry in the PRC is still at a very early stage of \ndevelopment. But the  Government recognizes that because of the large investments needed, \ngreater efforts are required to mobilize private sector funding.  \n5.  Water pollution remains a serious problem in most PRC cities. The Government has \nrecognized that pollution of water resources is a major threat to sustainable development. The \nproblem is being progressively tackled. Initial efforts were focused on industrial wastewater \ntreatment but investment is also being made in municipal wastewater treatment.  \n6.  The water sector continues to be a priority sector in the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u2013\n2005).  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on  (i) developing  water  sources;  (ii) protecting \nexisting sources by controlling industrial and residential pollution in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs; \n(iii) controlling  overextraction  from  groundwater  resources;  and  (iv) improving  demand \nmanagement by introducing water efficiency technologies and operations and using appropriate \npricing mechanisms. Guidelines for urban water supply emphasize (i) proper planning and the \ninclusion of water supply projects in national, provincial, and municipal economic development \nplans; (ii) mobilizing financial resources from users and from various government sources for \nthe construction of new facilities; (iii) full cost recovery from industrial and commercial users and ", "28  Appendix 4 \nrecovery of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs from residential users; (iv) use of loans \nand  credit  to  finance  urban  water  supply;  and  (v) application  of  new  technology  where \nappropriate. The Government is increasingly concerned about the need for policy reform and \ncapacity building to improve water resources management, and to introduce cost-recovery \ntechniques and capability to enable water delivery programs to be financially self-sustaining. \nAlso, because of the severity of urban environmental problems, the Government has made \ncities the focal point of its environmental protection efforts.  \n7.  In addition to ADB, the World Bank and a number of bilateral agencies have supported \nthe urban water supply and wastewater sector in the PRC. The World Bank has participated in \n19 urban, environmental, and water supply projects. A number of other bilateral aid agencies \nincluding those in Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Finland, \nand Sweden are also involved in the water and wastewater sectors, although on a smaller \nscale. Most bilateral assistance has been designed to address urban environmental problems \nwith an emphasis on wastewater and sewerage treatment, and energy conservation. \nB.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Development Experience \n \n8.  Since 1988, ADB has supported  50 technical assistance (TA) studies in the  PRC for \n$34 million to address issues relating to water resources management, environment, and water \nsupply. ADB has helped to strengthen the PRC\u2019s policies and strategies for water resources, \nincluding a TA that assessed the strategic options for the water sector.1 ADB has also supported \nspecific water resources and quality management and planning activities. An ADB-financed \nstudy assisted the Government in developing the National Guidelines on Water Tariffs (NGWT), \nfocusing on improving the cost-recovery performance of the WSCs. A follow-on study assisted \nthe Government in developing the institutional and methodological capacities to implement the \nNGWT tariffs and to set water tariffs.2 ADB is also assisting the Government in the formulation of \nnational guidelines for urban wastewater tariffs.3 \n9.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  PRC\u2019s  wastewater,  water  supply,  and  water  resources \nmanagement sectors has resulted in more rational pricing of water, major increases in water \ntariffs, introduction of wastewater tariffs, implementation of commercial principles, improved \nenvironmental  management  and  related  fees,  formulation  of  effluent  standards  and \ndevelopment of regulatory aspects, and the introduction of private sector participation. ADB is \nalso assisting the Government to design and implement market-based instruments for water \nquality management and establish dynamic water quality monitoring capabilities. These are \nfundamental improvements that will help make the water and wastewater sectors financially and \noperationally sustainable.  \nC.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Sector Strategy \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s operational strategy for the water supply and urban development sectors aims to \n(i) reduce existing bottlenecks that increase transaction and production costs, and hamper the \ngrowth of the industry and services sectors in urban areas, (ii) address urban environmental \nproblems, and (iii) reduce poverty and improve the living conditions and standards of urban \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

The unique problems of megacities, particularly environmental degradation, urban \nsprawl, and service bottlenecks, will continue to be addressed through policy advice, physical \ninvestments, and the use of market-based instruments for environmental management. While \nrecognizing the importance of problems in the coastal cities, ADB will promote investments in \nthe poorer inland provinces. In the water sector, ADB is focusing on (i) improving the efficiency \nof  water  supply  and  distribution  systems  through  investment  in  physical  infrastructure, \n(ii) promoting improved corporate governance and commercial management to enhance the \npotential for private sector involvement, (iii) improving cost recovery by strengthening tariff \nsystems and structures for raw water and treated  water, and (iv) ensuring water resources \nconservation and environmental protection through the continuing support of legislative and \nregulatory provisions governing water pollution and natural resources management. ADB is \npursuing investment projects in both physical infrastructure and human resources for urban \nwater supply, wastewater, and sewerage treatment. ADB assistance will focus on (i) water \nsupply  and  distribution,  (ii) sewage  and  wastewater  treatment,  (iii) water  conservation  and \nresources development, (iv) improvement of severely degraded water bodies, (v) solid waste \nreduction/recycling/treatment and disposal, (vi) clean technologies, and (vii) industrial waste \ntreatment and industrial recycling. \n11.  Due to the emphasis on cost recovery and tariffs, ADB\u2019s water supply projects are not \nnow focused in the relatively poor western and central provinces. However, poverty incidence is \nalso quite high in the coastal and northern cities of the PRC where there are an increasing \nnumber  of  laid-off  workers  resulting  from  state-owned  enterprise  restructuring.  ADB  water \nsupply and waster treatment projects complement the poverty reduction efforts of the concerned \ncity or municipality by (i) increasing income and skills of the poor from employment opportunities \ncreated by the construction and operation of the project; (ii) improving sanitation and public \nhealth benefits from improved and increased access to safe drinking water and waste water \ntreatment; (iii) raising agricultural production, income, and food security from increased water \nsupply for irrigation; and (iv) reducing loss of lives, property, and production as a result of the \nreduced risk of flooding.  \n12.  ADB\u2019s agenda for policy dialogue for water supply and wastewater covers (i) improving \ncost  recovery  and  tariff  reform;  (ii) strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework; \n(iii) improving environmental management in the water sector through wastewater treatment; \n(iv) improving resource management (water conservancy); (v) strengthening management of \nwater  resources  and  wastewater;  (vi) improving  corporate  governance;  and  (vii) promoting \nprivate investment in the water sector. Addressing urban environmental problems and improving \nwastewater treatment and water resources protection is accorded priority in ADB\u2019s PRC country \noperational strategy. ADB has provided the PRC with nine loans, totaling more than $1 billion in \nenvironmental improvement, wastewater management, and water supply. ADB has played a \nleading  role  in  promoting  the  involvement  of  the  private  sector  in  water  supply,  through \nseminars, follow-up TA to ensure transparent bidding procedures, and cofinancing.4  \n13.  The modalities of ADB assistance are through (i) project preparatory TAs that prepare an \ninvestment project in the water and wastewater sectors; (ii) advisory TAs that have a strategic \nimpact on the development of the water and wastewater sectors; and (iii) investment projects \nthat will provide the required water supply and wastewater treatment facilities.

The \nprovincial-level  interventions  include  (i) evaluating  and  certifying  the  domestic  counterpart \nfinancing plan, which si required by the State Development Planning Commission and the \nMinistry of Finance; (ii) monitoring the preparation of the domestic feasibility study report and \nfollowing detailed investigation and clearance submitting it to the State Development Planning \nCommission for approval; and (iii) monitoring project construction.  \nD.  Framework for Decision Making on Dams \n \n14.  ADB noted a report prepared by the World Commission on Dams5 and conducted a \nconference on the report in Manila in February 2001. The focus of the report is on improved \nconsideration of environmental and human impacts into plans for development of dams, whether \nfor irrigation, hydropower, or water supply. The strategic priorities identified in the report are: \n(i)  Gaining public acceptance: recognition of the rights and the need for informed \nparticipation of all stakeholders. \n(ii)  Comprehensive assessment of options: selection of projects by assessment of all \nrelevant policy, institutional and technical options, as alternatives to dams. \n(iii)  Addressing existing dams: adaptation to changing circumstances over the useful \nlife of a project, including social issues.  \n(iv)  Sustaining rivers and livelihoods: minimizing the negative impacts on the health \nand integrity of river systems.  \n(v)  Recognizing entitlements and sharing benefits: assuring the accountability of the \ndam owner or government to agreed provisions on resettlement, mitigation and \ndevelopment. \n(vi)  Ensuring compliance with commitments. \n(vii)  Sharing of rivers for peace, development, and security. \n \n15.  These strategic priorities have been developed after consideration of global statistics \nand  country  case  studies  on  dams,  which  indicate  that  many  large  dam  projects  have \nencountered  problems.  These  include  cost  overruns,  delays  in  completion,  shortfalls  in \nachievement of planning objectives, and rigidities in adapting to changes over the life of a dam \nproject. Regarding quality of dam design in the PRC, the technical expertise there in dam \ndesign and construction has increased significantly since 1959 and today the domestic technical \nstandards are at par with international standards. Under the 10th Five-Year Plan, the PRC is \ninvesting about $450 million into the upgrading of 145 large dams and 584 medium-sized dams, \nmany of them built before 1959.6 All past ADB water supply projects involving dams have been \nconstructed to meet PRC and international standards; there have been no major technical \nproblems or delays in implementation and resettlement has generally proceeded satisfactorily. \nRegarding the Mopanshan reservoir, there have been extensive consultations since 1996/97 \nwith  various  stakeholders  through  focus  group  meetings  at  the  village  and  county  levels, \nsurveys, and meetings. The local media disseminated information to the public on the proposed \nProject. The Project has strong local ownership with 75% of the resources being provided by the \nGovernment. The water tariff increases of December 2001 are generating $70 million for the \nProject. Following the NGWT, Harbin increased the tariffs after consulting the public through \npublic hearings.  \n                                                 \n5  Dams and Development: A New Framework for Decision-Making. 2000. World Commission on Dams. November. \n6  China Daily News, 21 February 2002. ", "  Appendix 5  31 \nPOLICY DIALOGUE \nA.  Poverty Reduction \n \n1.  Harbin Municipal Government (HMG) has noted that poverty reduction is an overarching \nobjective of ADB.  The results of a recently completed ADB technical assistance study on urban \npoverty in the PRC1 were discussed with HMG and HMWSCC. The purpose of the study was to \nassist the Government in developing an analytical framework for addressing increasing urban \npoverty. To achieve this, the objectives of the study were to (i) estimate urban poverty and \nvalidate the statistical findings, and (ii) provide recommendations for implementing the analytical \nframework. It was agreed that the framework would complement the ongoing poverty reduction \nefforts of HMG. \n2.  Discussions with the Harbin Price Bureau indicate an awareness of the need to protect \nthe poor from these adverse impacts of increased utility charges. Those living below the poverty \nline have been exempted from the most recent price increase in water supply charges. These \ncustomers pay a reduced tariff of CNY1.3/m3, as applied prior to December 2001, on showing \nHarbin Municipal Tap Water Company a certificate from the Civil Affairs Bureau to confirm their \neligibility. Broader discussions reveal that all levels of government are aware of the links \nbetween poverty, unemployment, and social unrest. Continued economic growth and reform of \nthe social security system are two of the principal policy objectives being pursued. Availability of \nan adequate water supply is a necessary condition for economic development and growth.  \nB.  Cost Recovery/Tariff Reform \n \n3.  The Project will support the Government\u2019s ongoing economic and enterprise reform \nprograms that require all water supply projects to be financially sustainable and capable of cost \nrecovery.  Water  supply  companies  (WSCs)  are  required  to  improve  their  cost-recovery \ncapability. Appropriate mechanisms for tariff setting are a critical factor in attracting the needed \ninvestment  to  the  sector,  ending  WSC  reliance  on  government  subsidies  and  providing \nincentives to users to conserve water resources.  \n4.  ADB is actively encouraging this transition in its policy dialogue and lending operations. \nTwo ADB water tariff studies supported the Government\u2019s initiatives, the first by assisting with \nthe development of national guidelines for appropriate tariff mechanisms at the national level, \nincluding the National Guidelines on Water Tariffs (NGWT). The NGWT was promulgated by the \nState Development Planning Commission and Ministry of Construction in September 1998 and \nwill become fully operational by 2003. The NGWT is the first national regulation on water tariffs \nand also the first national tariff regulation within the urban public utilities sector. Stipulations in \nthe  NGWT  cover  tariff  definitions,  tariff  setting,  application  and  approval  procedures, \nsupervision, and monitoring. Tariffs are to recover costs, fees, taxes, and profits; wastewater \ntreatment fees are included as an addition to the tariff and collected with the water bill. The \nNGWT provides a reference level for profit, based on source of funds. Tariffs should be set \nfollowing the principles of cost recovery, a reasonable profit, water conservation, and fairness to \nusers. The tariff application and approval procedures also include mandatory public hearings \nwhile the authority to approve new water tariffs lies within the concerned municipal government; \nthese are a major step in improving governance in the water and wastewater sectors. The ADB-\nfinanced second water tariff study focused on implementing the NGWT at the municipal and \nprovincial government levels, and provided assistance in (i) drafting the local implementing \nregulations  under  the  NGWT,  (ii) setting  and  approving  water  tariffs  following  the  NGWT, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

", "32  Appendix 5 \n(iii) making the NGWT fully operational, (iv) recommending ways to control the costs of WSCs, \n(v) assessing affordability and related urban poverty issues, (vi) assessing the impact on water \nconservation and sustainable environmental management, (viii) assessing water supply capacity \ndevelopment requirements, and (ix) developing a national program for implementing the NGWT. \n5.  As a result of policy dialogue, the municipal and provincial price bureaus confirmed that \nthe NGWT was being implemented in Harbin City. Accordingly, HMG increased its water tariff \ntwice, once by 34% in June 2000 and then by 26% effective December 2001. The cumulative \neffect of these increases was to raise average tariffs by 68%. Following detailed financial \nassessment, the full cost recovery wholesale price for raw water to be sold by Harbin Municipal \nWater  Supply  Construction  Company  to  HMTWC  is  CNY3.46/m3  upon  start  of  project \noperations. The average retail tariff that HMTWC will charge will be similar but the tariff to \ndomestic users is likely to be less, CNY2.75/m3. These rates are affordable, accounting for less \nthan 3% of the 2002 income of the poorest 10% of households in the service area. The major \nchanges in the NGWT that reflect specific recommendations of the first Water Tariff Study  \ninclude: (i) selecting a tariff structure based on local conditions and priorities, (ii) adopting full \ncost recovery as the main objective in setting and approving tariff levels, and (iii) adopting a \nsimple process for tariff regulation requiring evaluation and approval at the local level supported \nby review and monitoring at the provincial or state level. In addition, WSCs are requested to \ncontrol costs and decrease unaccounted-for water. Public consultations were held prior to \nadopting the tariff increases.  \nC.  Water Purchase Agreement   \n \n6.  A water purchase agreement  (WPA) between HMWSCC and the primary customer, \nHMTWC  was  signed.  Following  the  NGWT,  the  full  cost  recovery  project  level  tariff  was \ncalculated, and is included in the WPA. The WPA will secure the full cost recovery requirements \nand financial viability of HMWSCC by indicating the minimum quantity of water sales and the \npredetermined treated-water wholesale tariff. The WPA also assures that the  HMTWC will \nreceive high-quality treated water from HMWSCC once the Project is commissioned. The \nHeilongjiang Price Bureau has approved the water tariff levels under the Project, based on full \ncost recovery objectives. The signed WPA is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \nD.  Wastewater Management \n \n7.  The Government and ADB recognize that provision of an increased water supply leads \nto an increase in the volumes of wastewater generated. Adequate facilities for wastewater \ntreatment are essential for public health, and their lack tends to have a disproportionate effect \non the livelihoods of the poorer groups in the community. This treatment must be undertaken \nincrementally and in phases because of the high cost involved. The success of the wastewater \nmanagement  policy  will  impact  the  sector  objective  of  pollution  reduction  and  the  cost-\neffectiveness of wastewater management and operations. \n8.  ADB has supported the Government\u2019s policies in this area by providing a number of \nrelated  environmental  loans  that  included  wastewater  treatment  components  in  Tianjin, \nShanghai, Hefei, Chaohu, Beijing, Tangshan, Chengdu, Qingdao, and Fuzhou. The importance \nof wastewater treatment was also addressed under the Urban Environmental Improvement \nPlanning TA2 that strengthened institutions responsible for environmental improvement in a \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1993.

An ongoing ADB \ncluster TA3 for clean production, which contributed to the drafting of the 2002 Clean Production \nLaw, is promoting investments that use cleaner production technology, make appropriate use of \nresources, and minimize waste generation in urban and rural areas.  \n9.  Discussions were held with Harbin Planning Commission to identify overall investment \nplans for the sector. An overall wastewater management plan for the city has been drawn up \nunder the auspices of Harbin Construction Commission. A number of large-scale interventions \nare planned in the periods of the 10th and 11th Five-Year Plans to improve sewage interception \nand increase the proportion of  wastewater receiving treatment. Based on these plans, the \nincremental wastewater treatment capacity that will be added will exceed the incremental water \nsupply. \n10.  Discussions with Heilongjiang Environment Protection Bureau covered reference to the \npreparation of the Songhua River Pollution Control and Prevention Plan, which is expected to \nbe approved by the State Council in December 2002. The TA for Songhua River Water Quality \nand Pollution Control Management will assist the Government in refining the Songhua Pollution \nControl Plan and in firming up the time-bound action plan for cleaning up the Songhua River. \n11.  The PRC policy guidance on setting wastewater tariffs was amended by Circular No. \n1192, issued in September 1999 by the State Development Planning Commission, Ministry of \nConstruction, and State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) jointly. The Circular \nincludes provisions that wastewater tariffs be set on the basis of full cost recovery principles but \nallows local governments flexibility in deciding the time scale for implementation of the Circular. \nWastewater treatment charges were introduced in Harbin from 1 September 1999. The current \ncharges  are  CNY0.25/m3  for  residential  customers  and  CNY0.45/m3  for  nonresidential \ncustomers. Wastewater charges are levied on 100% of water customers. Harbin expects an \nincrease in the wastewater tariffs to about CNY1.0/m3 when the planned wastewater treatment \nplants are completed and in operation.  \nE.  Upstream Pollution Prevention and Control in the Lalin River \n   \n12.  To safeguard the quality of water released from the Mopanshan reservoir, it will be \nnecessary to prevent any pollution in the upstream part of the Lalin River system. As a result of \npolicy dialogue, HMG is giving high priority to protecting the Lalin River and the reservoir by \n(i) developing an environment management program to ensure that the high quality of the raw \nwater  from  the  Mopanshan  reservoir  is  maintained;  (ii) implementing  the  environment \nmanagement  plans  as  specified  in  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA);  and \n(iii) strengthening the environmental monitoring units in the Lalin River.  \n13.  HMG has Water Resources Protection Rules for the Lalin River watershed and will close \noff the reservoir to the general public and restrict access to its catchment area, which should \nprevent pollution from entering the water system in the upstream part. Part of the reservoir will \nbe classified as a nature reserve, and some of the indigenous mixed forests around the \nreservoir will be reestablished. The Lalin River Water Resource Protection Committee, which \nwill be established by December 2002, will coordinate and facilitate environmental monitoring \nand  mitigation  during  project  implementation.  The  Committee  will  increase  environmental \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1998.

The Committee will gradually expand the area of its expertise to the whole of the Lalin \nRiver basin, becoming the coordination and decision-making mechanism for the full scope of \nissues  related  to  water  resources  management  and  environmental  conservation.  The \nCommittee  will  serve  as  an  example  for  the  other  sub-basins  within  the  Songhua  River, \ncontributing toward developing and sustaining pollution cleaning and promoting sustained water \nresources and environmental management of the whole Songhua River basin.  \nF.  Regulatory Enforcement and Monitoring for Environmental Management \n \n14.  In May 1996, the National People\u2019s Congress amended the 1984 water pollution law to \naddress many of the weaknesses of the old law, and reflect the revisions recommended under \nan ADB-funded TA.4 Also in 1996, the State Council approved the 10th Five-Year Plan for \nEnvironmental Protection for 2010 with two supplemental documents, a total emission quantity \ncontrol  plan  for  major  pollutants  and  a  trans-century  green-engineering  plan.  Government \npolicies  have  shifted  to  enhance  command  and  control  approaches  with  market-based \ninstruments. ADB is helping design a water pollution trading system by actively supporting pilot \nprojects in Fuzhou and Shanghai. \n15.  To help build the necessary capacity for sound environmental management and to \nstrengthen  the  legal  framework,  ADB  helped  train  staff  of  the  Environment  Protection \nCommission of the National People\u2019s Congress and is assisting in drafting and revising some of \nthe PRC\u2019s environmental laws.5 ADB is also helping promote a more effective legal/regulatory \nframework for environmental protection in light of the PRC\u2019s transition to a market economy and \nits adherence to international environmental protection agreements. ADB helped upgrade the \nknowledge and skills of provincial legislative drafters in the review, amendment, and formulation \nof local legislation related to the protection and conservation of the environment and natural \nresources.6 ADB supported improved environmental management through (i) an analysis of the \nmost suitable market-based instruments and (ii) the formulation of a program for their adoption, \nspecifically  in  the  water  and  energy  sectors.7  In  addition,  ADB  provided  assistance  in \nenvironmental management by improving the institutional capacity of SEPA, and the local and \nprovincial  environment  protection  bureaus,  to  strengthen  environmental  standards  and  to \nenforce environmental laws and policies.8 \n16.  Both the Government and HMWSCC have acknowledged their responsibilities to ensure \nthat the commitments given in the EIA documentation are adhered to during the implementation \nof the Project. This responsibility will be discharged by HMWSCC in conjunction with relevant \ndepartments  of  HMG  and  a  specific  member  of  staff  will  be  designated  to  undertake  a \nmonitoring and coordination role. Establishment of appropriate monitoring procedures will be \nincluded in the implementation consulting services contract. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1994.

Water Conservation \n \n17.  The issue of water conservation is an important part of the government and ADB \nagendas in the water sector in the PRC. The water conservation policies that have been \npursued in conjunction with the Project include (i) ensuring that system losses are kept to a \nminimum  through  efficient  and  commercial  operations,  leakage  detection  and  repair,9  and \ntraining related to reduction of nonrevenue water; and (ii) providing market-based incentives to \nreduce water use through adequate pricing of water and the introduction of wastewater tariffs.  \nH.  Corporate Governance and Enterprise Reform \n \n18.  The  water  supply  sector  in  the  PRC  has  traditionally  been  owned,  managed,  and \noperated by the public sector through municipal water bureaus. Some of these have recently \nbeen converted into companies to encourage more independence, commercial operation, and \nmore responsible financial policies. The PRC\u2019s efforts to improve corporate governance in the \nwater sector have been encouraged and supported by ADB, whose Dalian, Anhui, Zhejiang \nShanxi  (Phase  I), and  Fuzhou  projects  all  included  assistance  for  capacity  building  and \nconversion to commercial operations.  \n19.  ADB\u2019s policy dialogue during project processing addressed three aspects of corporate \ngovernance:  (i) strong  local  ownership,  (ii) guaranteed  water  sales,  and  (iii) structuring \nHMWSCC along commercial lines. As a result (i) HMG will have equity ownership of HMWSCC \nand will be represented  on the board of directors; (ii) water sales are guaranteed through a \nlegally binding WPA; (iii) the Project will be constructed, owned, and managed by HMWSCC, a \nregistered, limited liability company; (iv) HMWSCC will be responsible for its own financial \nmanagement and performance and will prepare a business plan; and (v) HMWSCC will be \ngoverned by a board of directors that will be responsible for overseeing all financial and \noperational matters.  \nI.  Private Sector Participation \n \n20.  ADB has played a leading role in promoting the involvement of the private sector in \nwater supply. In October 1996, an ADB-sponsored seminar held in Beijing brought together \nmore than 100 senior government officials, bankers, and potential private sector investors to \ndiscuss private sector involvement on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) concept for water supply \nprojects.10 As a follow-up to this seminar, ADB approved a TA11 to assist the Government in \npreparing  a  pilot  BOT  water  supply  project  to  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  transparent \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  The  objective  of  the  TA  was  to  build  the  capacity  of \ngovernment agencies involved in BOT projects in water supply by providing assistance in the \nbidding and negotiation process. The TA and subsequent efforts have resulted in ADB financing \nof the BOT Chengdu Water Supply Project, the first private sector water supply BOT project in \nthe PRC for which the franchise was awarded on the basis of competitive bidding.12 This BOT \nproject demonstrates that water supply projects can be designed to be attractive to international \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1997.

The BOT Chengdu Project also demonstrated the importance of transparent, \nfair bidding processes, and the need for good legal documentation and assurances to reduce to \nacceptable levels the potential risks faced by potential project financiers. ADB approved, in June \n2002, the Water Infrastructure Development Facility Project.13 The facility will catalyze small \nwater supply and sewerage treatment projects that require substantial investments, but that, on \ntheir own, lack the economies of scale necessary to make them attractive for private sector \nfinancing. The facility will arrange private sector capital and give municipalities access to \nfinancing to (i) expand their water supply facilities to meet increasing demand and (ii) meet \ngovernment targets for wastewater treatment. Expansion of these facilities will improve the \nquality of urban life and public health conditions, arrest environmental degradation, and sustain \nacceptable levels of economic growth. \n21.  Over the past 2 years, HMG has pursued private sector participation possibilities for the \nProject.  ADB  provided  comprehensive  information  and  assistance.  ADB  made  a  detailed \npresentation to HMG in June 2001 on four financing options including (i) public sector financing \nof  all  components  (reservoir,  raw  water  conveyance  system,  water  treatment  plant,  and \ndistribution networks); (ii) public sector financing of reservoir, raw water conveyance system and \ndistribution  networks,  and  private  sector  financing  of  the  water  treatment  plant  through  a \ncompetitive  contractual  joint  venture;  (iii) public  sector  financing  of  the  reservoir  and  the \ndistribution network and private sector financing of the raw water conveyance system and the \nwater  treatment  plant  on  a  BOT  basis;  and  (iv) public  sector  financing  of  the  raw  water \nconveyance system and the reservoir and private sector financing of the water treatment plant \nand distribution network.  \n22.  HMG was interested in private sector participation to help in solving the counterpart \nfinancing problem and accordingly sought the BOT modality to include the water treatment plant \nand the 175 km long raw water pipeline. However, private sponsors were interested only in the \nwater treatment plant, not the raw water pipeline. HMG considered that in this case the BOT \noption would be less useful since the cost of the water treatment plant was relatively small. \nHMG carefully examined the advantages and disadvantages of the financing options presented \nand discussed these in detail with potential private sector sponsors. HMG conducted a detailed \nfield investigation to Beijing and Chengdu to further study their private sector experience. HMG \nexpressed  appreciation  for  the  assistance  provided  by  ADB  in  terms  of  provision  of \ncomprehensive information on the private sector participation matters related to the Project and \nthe detailed presentation made by ADB. During the inception phase of the project preparatory \nTA, HMG and HMWSCC finally decided to pursue the public sector financing option as the most \nviable, given the need to construct the Project on a timely basis. \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2002.

Introduction \n \n1.   The final resettlement action plan (RAP) was submitted to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in July 2002 and subsequently a summary RAP was posted on ADB\u2019s web site in August \n2002.  \n \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \n2.  The  Mopanshan  dam  will  be  built  in  the  upper  reaches  of  the  Lalin  River,  about \n1.8 kilometers (km) upstream from Shenjiaying Village, Shahezi Town, Wuchang City. The \ninundation of the Mopanshan reservoir and construction of pipeline will involve the demolition of \n85,000 square meters (m2) of private and public houses, mostly due to the reservoir inundation \nand a small portion due to the pipeline construction. In total, 1,740 households (6,022 people) \nwill be affected by land acquisition and resettlement. They include 859 households (3,314 \npeople) in Wuchang and 640 households (1,861 people) working at Shanhetun Forest Bureau, \nto be relocated for the reservoir inundation; 101 agricultural households (505 people) due to the \nconstruction  of  the  pipeline;  and  140  agricultural  households  (342  people)  for  the  water \ntreatment plant. \n \n3.  The Project will involve the permanent acquisition of 3,110 hectares (ha) of land. Of this, \n2,996 ha will result from the inundation of the Mopanshan reservoir, 89 ha from the construction \nof the pipeline, and 25 ha from the construction of the water treatment plant. The dam site, \nreservoir office, and living quarters will occupy an additional 42 ha of land. The construction of \nthe Mopanshan reservoir, pipeline, and water distribution network will also require the temporary \nacquisition of 650 ha of land. Table A10 provides a summary of land acquisition and housing \ndemolition. \n \n4.  Other assets to be acquired by the Project include auxiliaries, household utilities, trees, \npublic properties, basic infrastructure, special utilities, and a small hydroelectric plant. The \nassessment of impacts is based on measurement surveys for each component. While the scope \nof land acquisition and resettlement for Mopanshan reservoir and water treatment plant has \nbeen finalized, the routing of the pipeline and water distribution network may be subject to slight \nchanges, as may the scope of their impacts. The Harbin Municipal Water Supply Construction \nCompany (HMWSCC) is required to submit an updated RAP for approval by ADB if the routing \nchanges are significant. \n \nTable A10: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement  Impacts \nHouseholds and Population  Permanent Land  Temporary  Houses \nto be Affected   Acquisition (ha)  Land  to be \nHouse-  Agric.

The primary objective of the land acquisition and resettlement program is to ensure that \naffected persons (APs) will improve their standards of living, or at least not be made worse off \nbecause of the Project. This objective is consistent with the laws and regulations of the PRC \nand ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. The RAP is based on the provisions of the Land \nAdministration Law of 1998. In addition, the following associated laws and regulations also \napply  to  resettlement  under  the  Project:  (i) Heilongjiang  Land  Administration  Regulation, \neffective  2000;  (ii) Forest  Law  of  the  PRC;  (iii) Secondary  Phase  of  Land  Reallocation; \n(iv) Household  Registration  System;  (v) Administration  System  of  Registered  Permanent \nResidence;  (vi) Policy  on  Residential  Status  Transference;  (vii) Water  Law  of  the  PRC, \npromulgated in 1998; (viii) Environmental Protection Law of the PRC, promulgated in 1997; and \n(ix)  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Regulation  of  Large-  and  Medium-  Hydro  Power \nEngineering Construction, 1991. \n \nD.  Compensation and Entitlements \n \n6.  To ensure that the affected households and individuals can restore or improve their \nlivelihoods and living standards, adequate compensation and rehabilitation will be provided. The \ncompensation rates will follow the provisions of the Land Administration Law of the PRC, 1998, \nwhich  sets  the  minimum  of  land  compensation  and  relocation  allowance  for  all  types  of \nagricultural land at 10 times the annual average output value (AAOV) in the past 3 years. \nCompensation  rates  will  be  CNY78,000/ha  for  dry  land,  CNY118,000/ha  for  rice  land, \nCNY210,000/ha for fishponds, CNY216,000/ha for orchard land, CNY40,000/ha for forestland, \nand  CNY31,200/ha  for  homestead.  For  permanent  loss  of  land,  the  compensation  and \nresettlement allowance will be paid through the resettlement office of each affected village and \nforest station. These entities will distribute the land compensation and resettlement subsidy in \ncash to the individual APs. Any income lost from temporary land occupation will also be paid in \ncash directly to the APs at a rate of two times the AAOV. As soon as the construction is \ncompleted, the land will be returned to the users in its original form.  \n   \n7.  Compensation for public houses will be paid to the collectives and that for private \nhouses will be paid in cash directly to the owners, in compliance with the provincial guidelines \nfor housing replacement, according to the class and type of dwellings. Compensation for \nstanding crops, auxiliaries, and other assets (e.g., wells, sheds, walls, and tombs) will be paid \ndirectly to the APs based on the provincial compensation standards. The households will \nreceive  a  transfer  and  transportation  allowance.  Compensation  for  the  loss  of  house \nconstruction land will be paid to the village collective, to be reallocated to the residents. \nRelocated households will be allowed to salvage materials from their old houses. Compensation \nfor the loss of enterprises, shops, and small business will be paid in cash to the owners. All civic \ninfrastructures, facilities, and other assets will be compensated at replacement rates, without \nany deduction for depreciation, to allow full reconstruction by the relevant entities. \n \n8.  The principles of the compensation and entitlements established for the Project are: \n(i) land acquisition and involuntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible \nby developing and comparing a series of design alternatives; (ii) compensation and entitlements \nprovided must be adequate to allow APs to at least maintain their preproject standard of living, \nwith the prospect of improvement; (iii) land temporarily occupied and the period of disruption are \nto be kept to a minimum; (iv) all APs, whether with legal or illegal title, will be taken into \nconsideration and compensated; (v) the per capita land holding after land acquisition will be ", "44  Appendix 10 \nsufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standard; (vi) where land allocation per capita is not \nsufficient to maintain previous livelihood standards, other income generating activities will be \nprovided for; (vii) a preferential policy will be provided to vulnerable groups, including national \nminorities, in such things as compensation, housing assignment, transfer, and employment; \n(viii) all APs will be adequately informed about eligibility, compensation rates and standards, \nlivelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing; and (ix) there will be close internal \nand external monitoring.  \n \nE.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation \n \n9.  The ultimate objective of the RAP is to ensure that the living conditions of the affected \nhouseholds and host communities will be better after the Project, or at least will not be worse. \nSince the permanent loss of land to the Project will reduce the availability of the resources to the \nrural communities, which depend largely on land for their livelihoods, the achievement of the \nobjective of better living conditions will require establishment of income restoration programs \nthat will offer the APs, as well as their host communities, alternative livelihood opportunities. \n \n1.  Resettlement Plan for Shahezi Township Residents \n \n10.  In Shahezi Township, 3,314 APs, including 3,303 agricultural and 11 nonagricultural \npeople, will be relocated. Most of the APs (about 89%) will be resettled to the nearest villages, \nthe same township, or other townships within Wuchang City. At their request, a small proportion \nof the APs (9.8%) will be relocated under the sponsorship of relatives or friends. The rest (1.2%) \nwill move to cities or town centers, and their resident status will be changed from rural to urban.  \n \n11.  In Shahezi Township, most households to be affected by the land acquisition and \nresettlement are farmers. The HMWSCC identified in the early stages of resettlement a wide \nvariety of income restoration and livelihood restoration programs for all the affected sites. They \nhave provided information on these to the affected households and allowed them to choose, so \nthat the needs and expectations of the APs will be met to the greatest extent possible, in \naccordance with the results of the field survey and consultations by the design institutes with \nAPs, community leaders, and the local government. \n \n12.  For  people  who  would  like  to  move  near  their  relatives  or  friends,  resettlement \nimplementing agencies and local governments will assist with transfer and transportation. The \nland compensation and relocation allowance will be paid to such APs directly. People who \nchoose land-based resettlement in Wuchang will be moved to existing resettlement villages or \nto newly developed areas. The environmental and sociocultural carrying capacity of these host \nvillages and areas has been fully assessed, especially with regard to water supply for irrigation. \nThe average farmland holding will be increased from 0.24 ha before to 0.27 ha per person after \nresettlement. \n \n13.  In  addition  to  farmland  allocation,  agricultural  measures  include  developing  new \nfarmland, improving irrigation works, upgrading low-yielding farmland, and providing training in \nagricultural technology. Income generation activities such as forestry, horticulture, livestock, and \nsideline businesses will also be developed to restore incomes and livelihoods for the relocated \npeople, as well as for the host communities. Activities such as pig, chicken, and duck raising will \nbe developed to supplement the income of APs. The APs will also be encouraged to develop \nstraw-craft products, such as hats, curtains, rope, and bags. Affected urban households will \ncontinue at their current jobs so their income will remain the same as before relocation. \n ", "  Appendix 10  45 \n2.  Resettlement Plan for Shanhetun Forestry Bureau \n \n14.  The inundation of the Mopanshan reservoir will affect 640 forestry households or 1,861 \npeople in Shanhetun Forest Bureau (1,847 urban and 14 rural). As they are a nonagricultural \npopulation, they do not have farmland. Two forest stations, Hansong and Xianfeng, will be \nentirely relocated to the Fendou and Shahezi forest stations, respectively, about 50\u201360 km \naway. The 104 people in the Sanchahe forest railway station will be resettled to the Feidou \nforest station. People who do not want to relocate to the selected resettlement areas may \nchoose  to  resettle  under  the  sponsorship  of  relatives  and  friends.  The  resettlement \nimplementing agencies and local governments will assist in their transfer and transportation. \n \n15.  After relocation, the forestry workers will work in the same forestry bureau and in the \nsame forestry production areas. The bureau will be compensated by HMWSCC for the loss of \nforest land. HMWSCC and the Shanhetun Forest Bureau will redeploy all the affected forest \nworkers in the existing forest stations so that no jobs will be lost, and retraining will be provided \nto those whose jobs are changed. Some of the affected workers will also temporarily be \nengaged  in  the  rehabilitation  of  forest  stations,  such  as  rebuilding  of  nurseries,  railway \ntransportation, production facilities, and public infrastructure. The forest bureau will support and \nencourage those who have the desire, skills, and knowledge to develop their own businesses. \nSome APs will also be provided employment in the afforestation of wasteland around the \nreservoir area. The resettlement implementing offices of the forest stations and the Shanhetun \nForest Bureau will also encourage and facilitate APs in the collection and marketing of forestry \nproducts. \n \n3.  Pipeline and Water Treatment Plant \n \n16.  The  pipeline  corridor  will  pass  through  long  stretches  where  houses  are  sparsely \ndistributed.  Every  effort  will  be  taken  to  avoid  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The \nresettlement strategy will be to move people as close as possible to the original homes, and to \nminimize  the  impact  on  peoples\u2019  means  of  production  and  livelihood.  Compensation  for \ntemporary land acquisition will be paid directly to APs. The water treatment plant will involve \n25 ha of permanent land acquisition and APs will be compensated with replacement land \nnearby.  In  addition,  the  APs  will  be  given  special  preference  for  employment  during  the \nconstruction and operation of the Project.  \n \nF.  Vulnerable Groups \n \n17.  The socioeconomic survey identified 49 families as  vulnerable families: 37 national \nminority households (Hui and Korean households almost entirely integrated socioculturally into \nthe  Han  majority),  2  women-headed  households,  5  single-parent  households,  and  5  poor \nhouseholds. To ensure maximum protection of the vulnerable households, the following special \nprovisions  are  made:  (i) HMWSCC  and  Harbin  Municipal  Government  will  give  priority  to \nvulnerable groups for employment opportunities with the Project; (ii) a special development \nfund,  totaling  CNY7,000  per  vulnerable  household,  is  to  be  established  as  a  microcredit \nprogram  to  improve  their  agricultural  production  and  business  development;  (iii) a  50% \nreduction in water tariff will be given to poor households; and (iv) the village committee and local \ngovernment will provide assistance for house construction, including a house construction \nsubsidy. \n  \n18.  The programs for women will include the following: (i) HMWSCC will employ women \nstaff during resettlement operations to work with and assist women in resettlement activities, ", "46  Appendix 10 \nparticularly income restoration and poverty reduction plans for women; (ii) women will be given \nhigh  priority  for  employment  opportunities  generated  by  the  Project;  (iii) women-headed \nhouseholds  will  be  able  to  use  the  special  development  fund,  averaging  CNY7,000  per \nhousehold; (iv) special financial incentives will be provided for new small businesses/enterprises \ndeveloped by women from the affected households, according to the preferential policies of \nlocal government; (v) assistance for housing construction and housing subsidy will also be \nprovided to women-headed households; and (vi) targeted training will be provided to women. \n \nG.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n19.  The  project  resettlement  office  (PRO)  within  HMWSCC  will  be  assigned  the  lead \nresponsibility for coordinating the planning, implementing, financing, and monitoring of land \nacquisition and resettlement. The PRO, which has eight staff members, will also coordinate staff \ntraining for resettlement offices in the city, counties, and forest bureaus. At the municipal level, \nthe  Wuchang  City  Resettlement  Office  and  the  Resettlement  Office  of  Shanhetun  Forest \nBureau, each with 15 full-time staff, will supervise the resettlement of the Mopanshan reservoir. \nThe Wuchang City Resettlement Office and the Shuangcheng City Resettlement Office will be \nresponsible for the resettlement associated with the pipeline. The Harbin City Resettlement \nOffice will be responsible for the land acquisition for the pipeline, water treatment plant, and \nwater  distribution  network.  The  resettlement  offices  will  assume  full  responsibility  for \nimplementing the RAP in their jurisdictions. They will work closely with relevant township and \nvillage resettlement offices/forest stations, which will be responsible for delivering entitlements, \nselecting new housing sites, monitoring development of replacement land, and implementing \nother economic measures among both the affected and the host villages. \n \n20.  The  resettlement  implementing  offices  will  consult  with  the  branches  of  the  local \nwomen\u2019s federation to ensure that entitlements for women, especially households headed by \nthem, are paid and that gender issues are addressed properly. HMWSCC will finance the costs \nand assume responsibility for resettlement monitoring and reporting. Payments for resettlement \nentitlements and land and house compensation will be provided in full to APs before ground \nleveling or inundation takes place.  \n \nH.  Consultation and Grievance Redress \n \n21.  The Land Administration Law (articles 48 and 49) requires disclosure to and consultation \nwith APs. In April 2002, APs were notified about the key elements of the RAP during village \nmeetings  and  interviews.  They  have  participated  in  the  planning  and  designing  of  the \nresettlement program. Resettlement information booklets were distributed to APs in June 2002. \nIn addition, a number of meetings and interviews to discuss key elements of the resettlement \nstrategy were convened in both the relocation and host villages during implementation of the \nproject preparatory technical assistance, and the results were integrated into the RAP.  \n \n22.  Consultation  with  the  APs  will  continue  to  address  all  issues  prior  to  the  start  of \nconstruction and during the implementation of the RAP. Meetings will be arranged by township \nand  village  officials  and  will  be  attended  by  the  PRO,  municipal  resettlement  offices, \ntownship/village resettlement offices, and resettlement offices of forest bureaus and stations. \nEach affected household will have the opportunity to negotiate the valuation contract, which \nthey will sign with Harbin City Resettlement Office, Resettlement Office of Shanhetun Forest \nBureau, Shuangcheng City Resettlement Office, and/or Wuchang City Resettlement Office.  \n ", "  Appendix 10  47 \n23.  The grievance redress arrangements have been included in the resettlement booklets \nprovided  to  all  affected  collectives  and  villages.  The  resettlement  implementing  offices  at \ndifferent levels will maintain good records and make them available to the external monitors for \ninspection and verification. \n \nI.  Budget and Implementation Schedule \n \n24.  The preliminary cost estimate for the land acquisition and resettlement program is \n$61 million (CNY504.6 million) at October 2002 prices, including 10% contingencies. Of this, \n20% is expected to be used in the first year, 30% in the second year, 40% in the third year, and \n10% in the fourth year. The estimated costs include compensation for land and land allowance, \nhouses  and  auxiliaries,  transfer  and  transportation,  infrastructure  development  for  host \ncommunities, special facilities, infrastructure, land-related taxes, compensation for temporary \nland borrow, training, monitoring and evaluation, and other costs. HMWSCC will finance the \ncosts of land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \n25.  To  ensure  that  all  aspects  of  the  RAP  can  be  achieved,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement will start 1 year before construction. The APs will move into their alternative \nhousing at least 1 month before demolition. For those opting to construct their own houses, \npayment of compensation and provision of housing sites should be completed at least 3 months \nbefore relocation. Resettlement implementation will be scheduled in stages to coincide with the \nconstruction schedule and the initial filling of the reservoir. Before the APs are moved, a final \ndetailed measurement survey will be conducted in each village, and household contracts will be \nnegotiated  and  signed.  All  arrangements  for  housing  replacement  and  replacement  of \nagricultural land in the host communities will be finalized before relocation proceeds.  \n \nJ.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n26.  The Executing Agency and the RAP implementing agencies will take responsibility for \ninternal monitoring and supervision to ensure that the Project complies with requirements \ndescribed in the RAP. The status of resettlement implementation will be reported to ADB as part \nof quarterly progress reports. \n \n27.  An independent monitoring agency will be engaged by the EA, through competitive \ntendering,  to  undertake  resettlement  monitoring,  and  evaluation  for  the  Project.  External \nmonitoring will be undertaken semiannually during the land acquisition and relocation stage, and \nannual  evaluation  will  be  undertaken  for  2  years  after  resettlement.  The  monitoring  and \nevaluation reports report will be submitted to the EA, which will forward a copy to ADB.  \n \n28.  In  addition,  ADB  consulting  services  include  a  resettlement  panel  comprising  two \ninternational and one domestic resettlement monitors (a total of 8 person/months), who will \nmake recommendations to resolve any issues/problems. The panel will submit a report to the \nEA with their findings and recommendations at the end of each panel visit, with a copy to ADB. \n ", "48  Appendix 11 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY FORM \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector Identified as a National Priority in    Sector Identified as a National Priority in   \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   YES  Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?    NA \n  Contribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in PRC: In line with the Government\u2019s water \nsector strategy to promote socioeconomic development and to meet the basic needs of the poor, increased water \nsupply is needed to support the national poverty alleviation program. Adequate and clean drinking water supply is \nessential to human well-being and as a crucial enabler of economic activities. The Project will alleviate water \nshortages and reduce water-related diseases, from which the poor, women, and children suffer most. Overall, the \nwater supply project will complement the ongoing poverty alleviation effort in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                 Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n  Poverty analysis has been treated as an integral part of project design. It is based on quantitative (direct and \nindirect) and qualitative methodologies. The project planning and design has made use of poverty data at national, \nprovincial, regional, and subproject levels and has involved field-poverty assessments, questionnaire surveys, and \nstakeholder consultations, in particular resettlers and project beneficiaries. Participatory methods have been used to \nidentify the local poor population and the provisions that may better meet their needs. \n \n   In the project area, about 32% of the people live below the ADB operational urban poverty line of CNY3,300 \nper person per year. The Project includes monitoring mechanisms and an assurance that this population (32%) will \nhave access to the new water supply and can be eligible for the subsidy assistance in terms of waiver on tariff \nincreases, lifeline tariffs, and free meters and connections if they cannot afford the access. To ensure that water \nsupply is affordable and accessible to the poor, Harbin Municipal Government (HMG) has agreed to implement two \nimportant measures to maximize the poverty impacts. The first measure is to waive future tariff increases for the \npoorest households. The second measure is to connect poor households  to tap water in the districts of Dongli, \nDongfeng,  Pingfang,  Wanggang,  and  Xinxiangfang.  The  two  interventions  are  planned  for  the  water  supply \nimprovement program and will benefit about 325,000 poor people with a per capita income less than CNY3,300 per \nyear.  \n \n  Of the poor population of 325,000 people in Harbin City, about 225,000 people presently suffer from low \nwater pressure and 100,000 people have no access to tap water. Under the poverty intervention program, the pipeline \nconnection fees will not be charged to the poor households, which will result in a total saving of over CNY6 million to \nthe poor beneficiaries for the first phase and over CNY10 million for the second phase. Moreover, each poor \nhousehold will be provided with a water meter free of charge, an additional saving of CNY80 per household. These \npoverty intervention programs will support and enhance the poverty reduction impact of the Project. \n \n   As a result of the  project-related construction activities, about 3,500 employment opportunities will be \ncreated, of which 2,210 full-time employment opportunities will go to the local poor and/or women, translating into a \nsum of CNY55.0 million as wage payment. When the Project goes into operation, about 800 permanent employment \npositions will be created; about half of the operational positions or the equivalent of CNY2.2 million in annual wage \npayments are expected to go to the poor and women. Restaurants and grocery stores, along with entertainment \nfacilities and vegetable greenhouses, will be established to serve the construction workers. With the availability of \nmicrocredit and appropriate training, the poor and women can capture at least an equal amount of the opportunities \ncompared to other segments of the population. The procurement of local materials will boost the regional economy, \nand stimulate the development and expansion of local enterprises, thus generating further employment opportunities \nfor the poor and women. Since the project beneficiary area is home to a greater proportion of poor, the improved water \nsupply will benefit the poor disproportionately. The public health benefits of the Project for supplying clean and safe \ndrinking water are significant since the current water supply source is from the heavily polluted Songhua River, which \nis a primary contributing factor to the incidence of waterborne diseases. The improved water supply will reduce the \nmorbidity and mortality rates of waterborne diseases and associated medical costs, loss of working days, and human \nsuffering. For the beneficiary population as a whole, the total annual savings in direct medical costs as a result of the \nProject are estimated at CNY11.4 million per year from 2007. The benefits to children, elderly, women, and the poor \nwill be disproportionately greater given their susceptibility to such diseases. \n ", "  Appendix 11  49 \nC.

Beneficiaries were consulted as part of the decision-\nmaking process that led to a tariff increase. A community participation and awareness program will be formulated and \nimplemented by Harbin Municipal Water Supply Construction Company (HMWSCC) by December 2002 to serve as an \nongoing consultation mechanism for the involvement of all stakeholders. \nParticipation Strategy:                                                                                                                                               YES \n  A resettlement information booklet was distributed. The resettlement action plan (RAP) was published on ADB's \nresettlement web site in August 2002. Further consultation with people affected by the Project will continue through the \nresettlement process. Ongoing consultations will also be carried out by HMWSCC to understand and meet the evolving \nneeds and expectations of the users as well as to increase the awareness of the public, especially the beneficiaries, \nabout the benefits of the Project. This will encourage the active involvement of local communities to maximize their \nsupport for the Project, promote water consumption and saving, and raise the social acceptance of user fees. The \nconsultations will take the forms of annual questionnaire surveys by consumer category, combined with ad hoc \ncommunity forums. Women\u2019s organizations and schools have extensive networks that can be used for the distribution of \ninformation materials and survey questionnaires. \n \nD.

The  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  strategy  and \nimplementation are included in the RAP. \nGender   Nonsignificant  Women were fully represented in the participatory design to ensure that all  Yes \n  components of the Project reflect the women\u2019s role in the household activities, \n  domestic  economy,  and  that  employment/income  generation  and  improved \nefficiency and reliability of water supply benefits reflect women\u2019s needs. Special \npreference will be given to women for employment and training. Particular \nattention will be paid to women-headed households during the resettlement \nprocess. A project social development fund will be directed at women-headed \nhouseholds. \nAffordability   Nonsignificant  The affordability of the poor has been assessed. From 2007 through 2015, the  Yes \n  lowest 10% of consumers are expected to spend about 0.3% more of their \nhousehold income (from 2.5% to 2.8%) on water. This percentage is considered \nto be affordable. Impact on individual poor households will be mitigated through \nthe exemption from recent and future water tariff increases. \nLabor  Nonsignificant  The  construction  and  operation  of  the  Project  will  generate  about  3,500  Yes \n  employment opportunities to the local beneficiaries. Inundation of the Mopanshan \n  reservoir will resettle a total of 1,861 forestry workers, who will be fully deployed. \nNo job and income losses are expected to take place since all affected workers \nwill work in the same forestry bureau and in the same forestry production areas. \nProper training will be provided to the affected workers if it deems necessary.

There are about 50,000  Yes \nPeople  minority  persons,  including  Manchurian,  Korean,  Hui,  Mongolian,  Miao,  and \nZhang, who will benefit from the improved water supply. About 37 ethnic minority \nhouseholds (2 Hui and  35 Korean) will be affected by land acquisition and \nresettlement. Particular attention will be paid to them to ensure their interests and \nrights and sociocultural customs are protected.

In 1994, the Heilongjiang Provincial Water Resources Development Leading Group \ncompleted  the  catchment  planning  studies  of  all  the  rivers  in  the  province.  The  group \nrecommended that a new water source be developed for Harbin. All reasonable sources were \nconsidered, including five reservoir sites, later excluded because of high social, environmental, \nand/or investment costs. The group\u2019s studies confirmed the Lalin River catchment area as being \nthe most appropriate for a new water supply scheme for Harbin. Regarding the Mopanshan \nreservoir, there have been extensive consultations since 1996/97 with various stakeholders \nthrough focus group meetings at the village and county levels, as well as surveys and meetings. \nAs a result, the Project has very strong ownership at the local level and strong support from the \nHeilongjiang provincial government, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Construction, Ministry of \nWater Resources, and the State Development Planning Commission. The Project was identified \nin the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) as the least-cost alternative to the polluted Songhua \nRiver as a source of water for Harbin City. It is also considered a \u201ckey lifeline\u201d project for Harbin \nCity and Heilongjiang Province. A 3-year government research study1 suggests a linkage \nbetween health problems in Harbin and the known and suspected trace organic chemicals in the \nSonghua River water. There is uncertainty as to the extent to which these chemicals could be \nremoved even with advanced water treatment (AWT). \n2.  The 1999 feasibility study for Harbin Mopanshan Reservoir Water Supply Project was \nconducted by Heilongjiang Provincial Investigation, Design and Research Institute of Water \nConservancy and Hydroelectric Power, China Northeast Municipal Engineering Design and \nResearch Institute, and Heilongjiang Provincial Geology Investigation Institute of Hydrology and \nGeology Engineering. The report, finalized in May 2002, evaluated the technical, economic, \nfinancial, institutional, social, and environmental viability and sustainability of the Project. During \nthe  design  of  the  Project,  alternative  locations  for  reservoir/dam,  water  treatment  works, \npumping stations, water storage tanks, and raw water transmission and distribution mains were \nconsidered within the selected project area. The base case and sensitivity analyses given below \ndemonstrate that the Project is the least-cost acceptable alternative to the Songhua. \n3.  The objective of the Project is to provide 450,000 cubic meters (m3) per day of high-\nquality raw water to the city of Harbin, to treat that water, and to construct a piping network in \nHarbin City to supply it to retail customers. The Project will be constructed and operated by the \nHarbin Municipal Water Supply Construction Company (HMWSCC). Following treatment, the \nwater will be sold to the tap water company, Harbin Municipal Tap Water Company (HMTWC). \nA signed water purchase agreement ensures that HMTWC will purchase all the water that \nHMWSCC makes available through the Project. The water purchase tariff has been set to cover \nfinancial costs and is used in the financial analysis. The economic analysis estimates project \nbenefits from the willingness of the final consumer to pay. A least-cost analysis has been \nperformed, comparing the project to continued use of the Songhua. \nB.    Economic Parameters and Assumptions \n4.  An economic analysis of the investment Project was conducted over a 30-year period \ninclusive of the project construction period. Project construction will commence in 2003 and be \ncompleted in 2007. Before that time, a decision will be made as to the benefit of constructing \n                                                 \n1  Organic Poison Pollution and its Prevention, Research for Songua River, Heilongjiang Provincial Environmental \nProtection & Research Institute, March 2002. \n ", "  Appendix 12  51 \nPhase II, a second pipeline and treatment plant, which would double supply capacity. Economic \nbenefits and costs were denominated in terms of the domestic price numeraire and expressed \nin constant 2002 prices using an exchange rate of CNY8.3 per dollar. Project costs and benefits \nwere estimated on a without- and with-project basis appropriately apportioned on the basis of \nnonincremental and incremental project effects in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and its Handbook for the Economic \nAnalysis of Water Supply Projects.  \n \nC.    Costs \n5.  Base project investment and operating costs were estimated and apportioned on the \nbasis of tradable, nontradable, skilled, and unskilled labor costs, and valued in economic prices. \nTradable components were adjusted to economic prices using a shadow exchange rate factor of \n1.08, and nontraded components were valued at domestic market prices. Shadow wage rate \nfactors of 2.0 and 0.67 were applied to the domestic price level wages of skilled and unskilled \nlabor respectively. Additional conversion factors were used as necessary. Transfer payments \nwere excluded in the valuation of the cost estimates in economic prices. Physical contingencies \nwere added to capital costs.  \n6.  The Project will require the permanent acquisition of 3,110 hectares (ha) of land, of \nwhich all but 114 ha are for the reservoir. The economic value of this land was estimated from \nits annual output value, plus a conversion factor of 1.10. The opportunity cost of raw water was \nestimated on the basis of forgone agricultural production, the most economically productive \nalternative use of the water. CNY0.1 per m3 was added to project operating costs to allow for \nthe costs of tap water company sales and billing. \n7.  If increased use of the Songhua River as a source for required water is allowed, \nconstruction of an AWT plant would be possible for lower investment but higher operating costs \nthan the Project. These costs were estimated by the PPTA consultants, converted to economic \nprices as discussed above, and used in the least-cost analysis. \n \nD.     Benefits \n8.  Consumer willingness to pay for water was estimated separately for domestic and \nindustrial sales. The value of domestic water was estimated separately for (i) water of present \nquality, and (ii) the increased quality of water that will be provided by the Project. The value of \npresent quality water was taken from the CNY1.8 per m3 tariff now paid. The value of higher \nquality water was taken from household survey data, which indicated that people on average \nwere willingness to pay an additional 43% for such water, due to increased observed quality. \nThe value of industrial water was estimated from the value added to industrial output by water \ninput.2 The estimate for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) as a whole is CNY5/m3. For \nnorthern PRC, the average is CNY6.32. \n9.  The 43% willingness to pay-based quality increase to the value of water provided to the \ndomestic sector will include any supply and health benefits of which survey respondents were \naware, i.e., which they had observed. This would include the 24-hour-a-day availability of water \nand also well-known health problems such as diarrhea and hepatitis. However, there is minimal \nknowledge in the city of health problems caused by trace organic chemicals in the Songhua. \nThese are known to be capable of causing cancers, birth defects, and/or premature births but \nthe appropriate level of incidence of these problems in the city is uncertain. The government \nstudy also gives a calculation of the possible increased mortality as the excess risk factor \n                                                 \n2  As estimated by Hua Wang and Somik Lall of the World Bank\u2019s Development Research Group.

This has been used, with an estimate for the actual cost of \ntreatment, to calculate a possible benefit to be added to the above-mentioned willingness to pay \nbenefit observed by consumers. The cost of increased mortality has not been included since \nthere is considerable uncertainty as to the value to give for a statistical life.  \n10.  The government research study also argues that removing trace organic chemicals from \nthe water is difficult and provides results that imply that active carbon, the basis of AWT, would \nnot be sufficient. The relative quantities of trace organic chemicals found (averaged over 2 \nyears) were as follows: untreated, 100%; conventionally treated, 50%; and active carbon, 40%. \nThere are uncertainties as to the interpretation to give to these data, however, and these \nuncertainties are thought to be too large to enable a reasonable quantitative assessment of \nproject versus AWT health benefits.  Instead, an approach outlined in ERD Technical Note \nNo. 13 has been used. This note presents a method to calculate the required benefit per person \nserved in order to raise the EIRR to the cut-off point, assumed to be 12%. Essentially, the \nmethod divides the additional net present value required by the number of persons served, \ndiscounted at 12% over the period during which benefits will be obtained. A similar method can \nalso be used to estimate the required number of deaths saved before the river is cleaned of \npollutants. This does require a quantified value to give for a statistical life and estimates based \non both willingness to pay and productivity are given.  \n11.  In addition to the quantified benefits there are also other possible unquantified benefits \nfrom the Project. These include (i) construction opportunities in areas where there are few at \npresent; (ii) tourism and resulting employment generation at the reservoir site; (iii) stabilization \nof flows in the Lalin River that might increase irrigation and flood control possibilities; and \n(iv) diversification of supply, decreasing risks from drought or calamity (through the introduction \nof extremely hazardous wastes into the Songhua).  \n \nE.    Least-Cost Analysis \n12.  There have been advances in treatment technology since the decision to exclude the \nSonghua was made. For that reason, ADB and the TA consultants felt it necessary to evaluate \npossible alternatives using that river. This least-cost analysis does not have the support of the \nproject proponents, who do not consider the Songhua sufficiently clean to be an alternative to \nthe Project. The alternatives that were considered were:  \n(i)  conventional water treatment plant  \n(ii)  advanced water treatment plant  \n(ii)  full advanced water treatment plant  \n \n13.  The purpose of least-cost analysis is to allow simple choices between projects that \nwould provide the same, or at least similar, benefits. It should not be used by itself as a \nsufficient basis for comparison between projects that are known to have different benefits. For \nthis reason, it is necessary to evaluate each of the alternatives for comparative benefits as well \nas costs. \n14.  Conventional water treatment plant, even if backed by household boiling of water, would \nnot remove all known pollutants in the Songhua water. These pollutants would best be removed \nat source and this would probably be the least-cost solution. There are many relevant point \nsources, however, the most important of which are not under the direct control of the local \nand/or provincial government. In addition, certain of the trace organic chemicals previously \nreleased are now deposited in the riverbed and would continue to be released even if the \n                                                 \n3  Contingency Calculations for Environmental Impacts with Unknown Monetary Values. 2002.

Evaluation of the political and practical realities for pollutant \ncontrol has convinced relevant governments, the technical assistance (TA) consultants, and \nADB that this method cannot be expected to achieve the necessary result until around 2015. In \nthe meantime, Harbin needs clean water. Since conventional water treatment would not provide \nsuch water, by itself it is not a proper alternative for least-cost analysis.  \n15.  Theoretically,  it  would  be  possible  to  supplement conventional water treatment and \nprovide water for human consumption from an alternative source. This might be a separate \ndistribution system providing small quantities of full AWT water. Such a separate system was \ncosted by the project proponents, however, and was found during State Development Planning \nCommission review to be prohibitively expensive. Bottled water is not a realistic alternative. \nFirst, a small number of households (2.2%) use bottled water in the home at present. More \nimportantly, convincing nonusing households of the need to do so would require the publication \nby the Government of warnings about trace organic chemicals in river-based piped water and \nthe fact that boiling the water (e.g., to make tea) will not eliminate them. Second, is the effect of \nextreme cold in the Harbin winter (minus 200C). Carrying large quantities of bottled water into \nhigh-rise apartments in these conditions is hardly an option. \n16.  Both AWT and the addition of reverse osmosis (full AWT) would provide water that \nsatisfied existing standards and so have been included in the quantified least-cost analysis. The \ninvestment and net present value costs for the Project, AWT, and full AWT are shown in Table \nA12.1, which also shows the slightly higher costs for AWT estimated by the later desk study. \n \nTable A12.1: Costs of Project Alternatives \n \nAWT  AWT \nEconomic Costs  Project  TA Consultants  Desk Study  Full AWT \nInvestment (CNY million)  2,949  2,490  2,670  5,821 \nNPV All Costs (CNY million)  2,849  2,632  2,822  5,929 \nInvestment ($ million)  355.3  300.0  322.0  701.3 \nNPV All Costs ($ million)  343.2  317.1  340  714.4 \nNPV Cost Difference ($ million)     -26  -3  371 \nNPV Cost Difference (%)     -7.6  -1.0  108.1 \nAWT = advanced water treatment, NPV = net present value, TA = technical assistance. \n \n17.  Full AWT with reverse osmosis would cost nearly twice the Mopanshan project, in terms \nof both investment and the net present value of all costs. Therefore, it can be rejected as an \nalternative.4 AWT, as now envisaged, would have costs slightly (1%) below those of the \nproposed Project.  \nF.    Benefit Comparison\u2014Project and Songhua Advanced Water Treatment Water \n18.  Project and Songhua AWT water might differ in two possible ways. First is  observed \nquality, the willingness of customers to pay higher tariffs than for conventional water treatment \nwater. Second are any unobserved health effects, which would be costs to users but, because \nthey are not known, would not be included in surveyed willingness to pay. These health effects \nare known to exist with present quality water. Evidence that they are unobserved is provided by \nthe small proportion of households using bottled water and the high proportion boiling water. \nThe latter is believed to increase the  health effects of contaminants in current water and is \nunnecessary for standard pollutants that are removed by conventional water treatment. \n                                                 \n4  The peer review desk study has also rejected reverse osmosis as an alternative. ", "54  Appendix 12 \n19.  The observed willingness to pay for water provided by the AWT plant treating Songhua \nwater would be likely to be less than project water, if only because consumers would be less \nlikely to believe the water to be clean. Data are not available to estimate how much of the 43% \nvalue increase for project water quality should be applied to AWT and the results of a range of \nestimates between 50% and 100% have been calculated. AWT provision of water to industry \nhas been given the same benefit as project water.  \n20.  Assuming only  differences in  observed quality, excluding in other words the effect of \ntrace organic chemicals and assuming that the local government would allow it, the Project \nEIRRs vis-\u00e0-vis AWT would be as shown in Table A12.2 below. For example, if the willingness \nto pay for AWT water was only 50% of the willingness to pay for project water, then the EIRR of \nthe  Project  would  be  15.5%;  the  net  present  value  at  a  12%  discount  rate,  would  be \n$12.9 million. If the  willingness to pay for AWT water was 75% of the willingness to pay for \nproject water, then the EIRR for the Project would be 9.5%, and the net present value would be \n\u2013$6.6 million at a 12% discount rate. And if the willingness to pay for AWT were 100% of the \nwillingness to pay for project water (that is, people were willingness to pay the same for AWT \nand project water), then the Project would not have a positive EIRR; the net present value of the \nproject is -$26.2 million at a 12% discount rate. \n \nTable A12.2: Least-Cost Analysis Economic Internal Rates of Return \n \nAdvanced Water Treatment Observed  100% with \nQuality as % of Project   50%  75%  100%  Desk Study Costs \nEIRR (%)         \nProject  15.5  9.5  \u2014  \u2014 \nNPV ($\u2019000)           \nProject  12,878  (6,649)  (26,177)  (3,269) \n \u2014 = not available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \n \n21.  Both the TA and the desk study consultants agree that there is significant uncertainty \nover the extent to which AWT could remove the trace organic chemicals. There is also the \npossibility  that  AWT  could  add  possibly  hazardous  chemicals  as  a  result  of  breakpoint \nchlorination to remove ammonia.  \n22.  It is safe to assume that people are unaware of the potential health risk of AWT water, \nsince it is a very technical issue, and since the health risk of even the current water is largely \nunknown to the people of Harbin. Under this assumption, then, the Project could provide \nadditional benefits relative to AWT, since the benefit of reduced health risk would not already be \ncaptured in the measured willingness to pay. \n23.  Table A12.3 shows the required extra benefits of the Project in per capita terms, using \nthe methodology presented in ERD Technical Note No. 1. For example, if people are willing to \npay the same for AWT and project water (that is, AWT observed quality as a percent of the \nProject is 100%), then the required extra benefit of the project is $6.09 per person per year with \nthe TA consultants\u2019 cost estimates and $0.76 per person per year with the desk study cost \nestimates. The table also shows the required extra benefit of the Project for other levels of the \nwillingness to pay for AWT versus the Project. \n24.  To put these per capita figures into some perspective, the per capita income in Harbin is \nabout $750 per year, and the per capita water expenditure is about $5 per year (the annual \nwater bill per household is $17). \n ", "  Appendix 12  55 \nTable A12.3: Required Benefit Per Year Per Person Served to Raise the Economic \nInternal Rate of Return to 12% \n \nAdvanced Water Treatment Observed Quality  100% Desk \nas % of Project  75%  100%  Study \nBenefit ($)  1.55  6.09  0.76 \n \nG.  Economic Internal Rate of Return (and average incremental economic costs)\u2014No \nSonghua Alternative \n25.  The base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project, to be funded by \nADB, is 12.6%. These estimates include observed willingness to pay for higher-quality water. \nThey do not include the health benefits from decreased trace organic chemicals in the treated \nwater, unless consumers are fully aware of these possible benefits. There are reasons to \nassume that they do not. If this is correct, and if only the benefits from decreased health risks to \nserved persons to 2015 are included, the EIRR would increase to 18.2%. These do not include \nthe benefits from the unquantified benefits listed above.  \n26.  The average incremental economic costs for treated water provided by the Project to \nHMTWC, including on-selling costs to consumers, are estimated at CNY4.24. \nH.    Sensitivity Analysis and Switching Values\u2014No Songhua Alternative \n27.  Sensitivity analysis and the calculation of switching values was undertaken for the \nProject and the results are shown in Table A12.4. The switching value is the percentage change \nin the variable (costs or benefits) required to set the EIRR equal to 12% or the net present value \nto zero (sensitivity indicators, if required, are the mathematical inverse of the switching values).  \n \nTable A12.4: Sensitivity Analysis\u2014No Songhua Alternative \nCost  Revenue \nBase  Both \n  Increase  Decrease  Base Plus  \n     20%  24%    Health Benefit \nEstimated Value               \nEIRR (%)  12.6  10.2  9.0  6.9  18.2 \nNPV (CNY million)  125  (445)  (601)  (1,171)  1,278,645 \nSwitching Value           \nEIRR (%)    4.9  3.2  2.0   \nNPV (%)    4.4  3.4  1.9   \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \n \n28.  The sensitivity analysis for cost increases should be interpreted with caution as it does \nnot include the effects of cost changes on the required tariff and through that on demand. This is \nalso important for the financial analysis. To deal with this, the sensitivity analysis for revenues \nincludes the effect of a higher than usual revenue decrease, 24%. This figure was obtained in \nthe financial analysis as a possible overrecording of demand. \n29.  The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the Project is cost and benefit sensitive. This \nis mainly because of the closeness of the base EIRR to the discount or cut-off rate. The \nswitching values indicate that a 4.9% increase in project costs or a 3.2% decrease in benefits \nwould drop the EIRR to ADB\u2019s cutoff rate of 12%.  \n30.  Project risks during construction are acceptable in economic terms but will require good \ncost management. The project risks during implementation are acceptable provided institutional, \nfinancial, and environmental sustainability can also be achieved. ", "56  Appendix 12 \nI.    Summary of Distribution Analysis \n31.  The  direct  poverty  impact  of  the  Project  is  assessed  by  evaluating  the  expected \ndistribution of the net economic benefit to different groups.5 The approach includes three steps. \nThe first step is to estimate the present value of net financial and economic benefits by each \nparticipating group. Next, group-wise, the financial benefits are deducted from the economic \nbenefits to give the distribution of  net economic benefit.  Finally,  the  net  economic benefit \naccrues to the poor according to the proportion of each group that is poor. A poverty impact \nratio expressing the proportion of net economic benefit accruing to the poor can be calculated \nby comparing net economic benefit to the poor with net economic benefit of the Project as a \nwhole (Table A12.5).6 \n \nTable A12.5: Benefit Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n(present value at 12%, CNY million) \n    Accounts      Beneficiaries     \n  Financial  Economic      Government  Unskilled   \nItem  Accounts  Accounts  Difference  Consumers  Economy  Labor  Total \nA.
