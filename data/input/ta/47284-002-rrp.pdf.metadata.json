THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the South Asia Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation (SASEC) Transport, Trade Facilitation, and Logistics Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will promote regional connectivity in the Phuentsholing area with a direct \nroad  connection  between  Samtse  and  Chhukha  districts.  The  new  road  section  between \nPhuentsholing and Chamkuna will (i) complete the last missing 3.3-kilometer (km) link along the \nPhuentsholing\u2013Samtse national highway, (ii) activate the full value of the entire 58 km Southern \nEast\u2013West Highway (SEWH) section for road users, and (iii) link Samtse district to the rest of \nthe  country.  The  trade  facilitation  and  logistics  component  is  aimed  at  improving  the \ninfrastructure and services at the border crossing points by adding additional equipment to \nfacilitate  cross-border  traffic  and  transit  of  goods  and  services,  trade,  and  commerce \nnationwide.2 These interventions are targeted at improving the working conditions and service \ndelivery at the checkpoints so that goods and services can be exported and imported safely and \nefficiently. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Landlocked  Bhutan  faces  unique  development  challenges  and  opportunities.  The \ncountry\u2019s small population of about 745,000 is dispersed throughout its mostly mountainous \nterrain.3 Formidable weather conditions make it difficult and expensive to deliver services and \nbuild  and  maintain  vital  infrastructure,  particularly  roads.  Almost  two-thirds  of  Bhutan\u2019s \npopulation still lives in rural areas and depends on an improved and available road network to \nensure its daily basic needs. Bordered by India in the east, west, and south, Bhutan is heavily \nreliant on its much larger neighbor for international trade. India accounts for 84% of its exports, \nincluding electricity, and 73% of its imports.4 However, Bhutan\u2019s inadequate cross-border road \nnetwork and customs infrastructure are hampering its international trade and logistics capacity. \nIt is important to lower high transport costs and improve accessibility and customs clearance \nservices to spur the country\u2019s economic and social development. \n \n4.  Road transport is the dominant mode of transport for passengers and freight within the \ncountry and with neighboring states in India, and national highways are the main arteries in the \nroad network. However, road construction in Bhutan remains a challenge due to the difficult \nenvironment and extreme weather conditions, especially during the monsoon season, when \nlandslides make roads along the hillsides unpassable. \n \n5.  The main border crossing point between Bhutan and India is in the city of Phuentsholing \nand connects Bhutan\u2019s north\u2013south highway to India\u2019s national highway network. Phuentsholing \nis the most important gateway for cross-border traffic and accounts for 74% of the total value of \nimport and export trade in the country. The inadequacy of the border facilities in dealing with this \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for preparing the project; \nBHU TA 8708 Kingdom of Bhutan: South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Transport, Trade Facilitation \nand Logistics Project. \n3  ADB. 2015. Basic Statistics 2015. Manila. \n4  Bhutan\u2019s international sea trade currently moves through Kolkata Port in India. Chittagong Port in Bangladesh is \nexpected to become an alternative port in the future. \n ", "2 \ntraffic causes long idle times, particularly when clearing goods for transport, which leads to \nheavy congestion and constrains trade in the city. \n \n6.  Bhutan is a member of the SASEC Trade Facilitation Program and receives support \nthrough the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other multilateral donors in complying with \ninternational standards and facilitate the safe and efficient trade of goods. However, cross-\nborder  trade,  logistics  procedures,  and  infrastructure  require  more  extensive  assistance. \nCurrently there are no cross-border facilities for trade on either side of the border. Through ADB \nassistance, construction of a new mini dry port (MDP) in Phuentsholing and a land custom \nstation (LCS) in Allay will be completed by early 2019.5 The trade facilitation and logistics \ncomponent under this project will finance identified additional equipment for trade facilitation, \nwhich will supplement the ADB-financed infrastructure and improve the customs processes for \nhandling goods in the two cross-border facilities to support efficient and secure cross-border \ntrade in the subregion. The main beneficiaries of improved handling of goods are the industry \nand trade, and agriculture sectors. Key imports are construction materials, food, and household \ngoods; key exports are timber, cardamom, apples, potatoes, oranges, steel, and ferro-alloys. \nThe project will expedite customs modernization and reform processes and help Bhutan comply \nwith the revised Kyoto Convention standards to simplify and harmonize customs procedures.6 \n \n7.  The government\u2019s strategic thrusts under the country\u2019s Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2013\u2013\n2018,  are  inclusive  social  development,  accelerated  green  economic  development,  and \nstrategic infrastructure development.7 In the transport sector, this involves the construction and \nimprovement of national highways. Improving efficiency in the sector will boost domestic and \ncross-border trade and allow for better delivery and wider coverage of basic social services. \n \n8.  The  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  has  aimed  to  improve  road  conditions  through \nsustainable road development and maintenance. It provides its staff with on-the-job training \nabout international best practices from international consultants, mainly during the course of \nimplementing  projects  financed  by  ADB  or  other  bilateral  development  partners.  This  has \nresulted  in  a  growing  number  of  dedicated  and  technically  capable  staff,  and  has  helped \novercome deficiencies in road maintenance capacity, road asset management, and road safety \nissues. The budget allocation for appropriate road maintenance has steadily increased since \n2011, and the DOR is increasing the number of maintenance centers to provide sufficient \npreventive maintenance and respond faster to damage caused by landslides or other natural \ndisasters. ADB has helped Bhutan develop its road sector strategy, road asset management, \nand  road  safety  program through more than 10  technical  assistance  projects,  which  have \nfacilitated the establishment and enhancement of the DOR\u2019s internal capacity. \n \n9.  The government has requested ADB financial assistance for the prioritized construction \nof the missing 3.3 km Phuentsholing\u2013Chamkuna link. The completed SEWH section between \nPhuentsholing and Samtse will provide a direct inland connection, which is important to develop \nthe  southwestern  part of  Bhutan.  Currently,  connecting  to  Samtse  district  involves  indirect \nroutes, either south via India or through a long indirect journey using the northern east\u2013west \nhighway. The completed section also runs parallel to the Indian border and connects several \ntowns  in  the  country\u2019s  southwestern  part,  which  had  previously  not  been  connected  by  a \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2014.

It will also indirectly connect with Ha district, which is now only \nconnected to the north and requires long detours to reach the commercial hub and border \ncrossing point in Phuentsholing. The provision of a domestic road connection will reduce the \ntravel distance between Samtse and Chhukha districts and decongest the main border crossing \nin Phuentsholing. As a result, the Phuentsholing\u2013Chamkuna road will foster inclusiveness by \ngiving larger segments of Samtse and Ha districts\u2019 populations better access to markets and \nbasic services in Phuentsholing. \n \n10.  The 3.3 km Phuentsholing\u2013Chamkuna link will complete the last part of the 58 km \nSEWH section and allow travelers to reap the full benefit of this national highway between the \ntwo districts. The 3.3 km road section is constructed partly on the bed of the Amochu River and \nadjoins to a steep and unstable slope on the eastern side. Due to these characteristics and \ntechnical  challenges,  the  road  could  not  be  developed  solely  with  government  funding, \nespecially since the road is also the first of this type to be built in the country. In the west, the \nroad will connect to the existing road formation leading to the Amochu Bridge. At the eastern \nstart point, it will connect to the northern bypass road (footnote 5) and to the Omchu Bridge in \nPhuentsholing,  and  will  supplement  infrastructure  projects  in  the  region  funded  with  ADB \nassistance.8 Through traffic from the west, bound for the north and east, will therefore be able to \nbypass Phuentsholing. \n \n11.  The project and its outcome are consistent with the strategic objective set in ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Bhutan, which is to assist the government in (i) \nachieving  inclusive  economic  growth  by  developing  key  infrastructure  for  transport  and \nenhancing trade facilitation, and (ii) broadening access to economic opportunities and making \ngrowth more inclusive by providing support to enhance national and cross-border connectivity.9 \nThe project also supports government plans for the construction and improvement of national \nhighways  to  boost  international  and  regional  trade.  The  project  is  included  in  the  country \noperations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Bhutan and in the regional operations business plan, \n2016\u20132018 for South Asia.10 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  will  be  improved  mobility  and  cross-border  movement  of  goods  and \npassengers, aligned with Bhutan\u2019s Eleventh Five Year Plan (footnote 7). The outcome will be \nimproved road connectivity and service delivery at the border crossings in Samtse and Chhukha \ndistricts. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  There  will  be  two  outputs:  (i)  3.3  km  of  national  highway  constructed  between \nPhuentsholing and Chamkuna; and (ii) equipment for trade facilitation and logistics at MDP in \nPhuentsholing and the LCS in Allay procured and installed. Output 1 consists of a two-lane \nnational highway section with pedestrian walkways on a 6-meter high embankment to take into \naccount the special environmental conditions along a riverbed (para. 10). Output 2 includes a \ntruck X-ray scanner, handheld scanners, heavy machinery for transshipment and off-loading \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2011.

The Department of Revenue and Customs (DRC) will appoint Phuentsholing Thromde to \nact on its behalf as executing and implementing agency for the trade facilitation and logistics \ncomponent of the project. For this purpose, the DRC will open the project account and channel \nthe funds to Phuentsholing Thromde, but ownership of the trade facilitation equipment procured \nand  installed  under  this  project  remains  with  the  DRC.  The  engineering  designs  and  the \npreparation  of  bidding  documents  for  the  equipment  and  the  road  component  are  being \nconducted through existing consultancy contracts under the SASEC Road Connectivity Project \n(footnote 5). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  Engineering. The 3.3 km national highway section is constructed partly on the bed of \nthe Amochu River stream. The east side of the road is adjacent to a mostly unstable mountain \nslope with corresponding degradations. To minimize possible interruptions in the use of the \nroad, a conventional design is not sufficient or sustainable. Technical solutions will be applied to \nsecure the road asset against forces of nature. The engineering design for the road is based on \n ", "6 \nsite conditions and field investigations, and includes protective measures for the embankment. \nThree actions to avoid erosion and deployment of flood control systems were integrated in the \npreliminary design: (i) positioning diverging spurs with bank reinforcement and anchoring the \nembankment, (ii) training the river to maintain a safe distance between the main Amochu river \nchannel and the embankment during the construction, and (iii) controlling surface runoff laden \nwith  sediment  and  boulders  from  the  hillside  east  of  the  embankment  road  by  providing \nadequate channeling structures that will allow water to pass under the road toward the Amochu \nRiver. The design will optimize the construction works for cost-effectiveness and use proven \ntechnology and standard materials compatible with local conditions for a durable road with \noptimized  maintenance  costs.  The  chosen  road  alignment  has  the  least  impact  on  the \nenvironment and social safeguards and is closely coordinated with future projects in the area. \nMeasures to support road safety and climate resilience features have been included in the \npreliminary design and will be confirmed during detailed road design. \n \n20.  The project will provide trade facilitation equipment at the MDP in Phuentsholing and the \nLCS in Allay in the form of (i) a truck gantry X-ray scanner; (ii) a container lifter; and (iii) several \nsmaller types of equipment, such as customs rummage kits, drug testing kits, safety protective \nwear, and closed-circuit television systems. The technical specifications for the trade facilitation \nequipment have been assessed by the design consultant under the ongoing project (footnote 5) \nand are included in the design layout of the Phuentsholing MDP and Allay LCS. The number \nand type of equipment will be further assessed and selected during project implementation to \nsupport the best possible functions and roles of the two trade facilities. \n \n21.  Operation  and  maintenance.  Two  agencies  will  be  involved  in  the  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the equipment to be procured and infrastructure to be constructed under \nthe project: the DRC for the equipment at the Phuentsholing MDP and the Allay LCS, and the \nDOR for the 3.3 km national highway section. For the O&M of major equipment, a maintenance \ncontract and training for operating the machinery and equipment will be included in the supplier \ncontracts. To help sustain the road component, the construction supervision consultant (CSC) \nrecruited under the project will perform on-the-job training to develop the skills and ability of \nDOR staff to manage the road assets and oversee the road safety and climate resilience \naspects of the project throughout construction. The CSC, together with the DOR, will assess the \nrequired and preventive road maintenance measures for the road. On this basis, the DOR will \nprepare  and  maintain  a  road  asset  management  system  during  project  implementation  to \nensure that sufficient annual funding is set aside for O&M after road completion. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The economic assessment was carried out in accordance with ADB guidelines.13 The \nproject  is  expected  to  (i)  increase  connectivity  by  completing  a  missing  link  of  the \nPhuentsholing\u2013Samtse  highway  between  Phuentsholing  and  Chamkuna,  which  will  provide \ntravel time and vehicle operating cost savings for road users; and (ii) strengthen cross-border \ntrade and economic development by providing trade facilitation equipment at border crossings, \nwhich will enhance operational efficiency and improve fraud prevention, control, and detection. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project is estimated at 17.0% for the road \ncomponent and 15.5% for the trade facilitation and logistics component, with an overall EIRR of \n16.7%. Sensitivity analysis showed that both project components would remain economically \nviable in the event of a 10% increase in cost, a 10% reduction in benefits, or a combined 10% \n                                                \n13 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "7 \nincrease in cost and 10% reduction in benefits. In this last scenario, the EIRR would be 15.1% \nfor the road component and 11.8% for the trade facilitation and logistics component. \n \n23.  The financial sustainability of recurrent O&M costs was assessed for each component. \nIncremental annual costs for the Phuentsholing\u2013Chamkuna road are estimated to account for \n0.24% of the DOR\u2019s annual road maintenance budget of Nu3.5 billion in FY2016. Given the \nactual budget and the commitment of the government to provide adequate funds for road \nmaintenance under the Eleventh Five Year Plan, it is reasonable to expect that funds will be \navailable  to  meet  the  O&M  costs.  While  the  DOR\u2019s  budget  for  routine  maintenance  has \nsignificantly increased from Nu126.8 million in FY2012 to Nu281.1 million in FY2016, the budget \nfor periodic maintenance has varied by a factor of 1 to 7 in the same period. The risk associated \nwith  the  sustainability  of  the  road  section  has  therefore  been  rated  medium,  and  further \ndiscussions are proposed with the DOR and the government to help secure sufficient budget \nallocations for road O&M. The trade facilitation equipment is non-revenue earning, as cost \nrecovery will not be directly sought from users. Instead, the equipment is expected to generate \nindirect revenues through additional taxes and fines by use of a truck gantry scanner, which will \nallow systematic inspections of trucks and increase fraud prevention, control, and detection. The \ntotal annual costs required for the O&M of the trade facilitation equipment are estimated to \namount to Nu21.8 million in 2019, or 41.1% of the expected additional customs revenues, which \nare tax revenues accruing to the general revenues of the government. \n \nC.

The DOR will be the executing agency for the road component, \nand Phuentsholing Thromde, on behalf of the DRC, will be the executing agency for the trade \nfacilitation  and  logistics  component.  Both  the  DOR  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  have \nexperience in ADB-financed projects as an executing agency and implementing agency and \nhave appropriate staff at their disposal. \n \n25.  Financial management. An assessment of the accounting systems, financial reporting, \nand external audit procedures of the DOR and Phuentsholing Thromde concluded that their \nfinancial management systems are satisfactory. The accounting and reporting process in the \nfinance and accounting manuals developed by the Ministry of Finance will be followed. The \nDOR and Phuentsholing Thromde use the government\u2019s standardized budget and accounting \nsystem, which has been computerized since 2003, produces satisfactory financial reports, and \nensures  data  availability.  Each  project  implementation  unit  of  the  DOR  and  Phuentsholing \nThromde will include a suitably qualified accountant. Each will maintain separate project records \nand accounts to identify financing resources received and expenditures made for the project \nand ensure an adequate audit trail. The Royal Audit Authority of Bhutan, an independent and \nnonpartisan institution authorized to perform audits on government agencies, will audit project \nfinancial statements annually in accordance with international auditing standards. \n \n26.  Procurement. The overall risk related to the procurement capacity of the DOR and \nPhuentsholing  Thromde  has  been  assessed  as  low.  Both  have  implemented  ADB-funded \nprojects in the past, are presently implementing the SASEC Road Connectivity Project, and \nhave procured works and consulting services under ADB guidelines. The Public Procurement \nPolicy  Division  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance  oversees  public  procurement  under  the \ngovernment\u2019s  Procurement  Rules  and  Regulations  (2009).  The  division  is  mandated  to \nrecommend reforms of the procurement policy or laws to the government, prepare standard \nbidding documents, issue technical guidelines and manuals on procurement, and liaise with \ngovernment organizations to develop human resources and professionalism in procurement. \n ", "8 \nThe regulations recognize that the procurement rules and procedures of development partners \nmay prevail in projects funded by development partners. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the DOR, and Phuentsholing Thromde. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Poverty  reduction  and  social  impact.  Key project beneficiaries are the estimated \n65,387 Samtse district residents, 25,000 Phuentsholing residents, and traders and business \nowners from India and Bhutan. Chhukha district, where Phuentsholing is located, has a poverty \nrate of 11.2% compared with 22.2% in Samtse district. The road component will facilitate safer \nand  more  reliable  access  between  Samtse  and  Phuentsholing,  providing  an  alternative  to \ntraveling via India, which is currently the main link between these two towns. It will provide \nSamtse district residents with better access to markets and services in Phuentsholing. The trade \nfacilitation  and  logistics  component  will  improve  import  and  export  processes  in  the  most \nimportant  gateway  for  cross-border  traffic  in  the  country,  facilitating  household  access  to \ncompetitively priced goods and contributing to the country\u2019s development and integration with \nregional and international markets. \n \n29.  Gender. The gender assessment conducted during preparation (footnote 2) indicates \nthat women will benefit equally from the road, with 90% of them feeling comfortable traveling \nalone in taxis and buses or using their private vehicles. Most of the women consulted (92%) \nwere not interested in participating in construction activities, as most of them work in the civil \nservice or in the private sector, or manage their own businesses. Women are, however, likely to \nparticipate in maintenance activities, as females represent currently already more than 50% of \nthe road maintenance national workforce. The project is to be categorized as having some \ngender elements with the implementation of the following gender mainstreaming activities: (i) \nincluding  pedestrian-  and  women-friendly  design  features,  such  as  pedestrian  walkways, \nbenches, and signage; (ii) conducting (a) training sessions for DOR officials on how to better \nintegrate gender design features into future projects, and (b) on-the-job training for DOR staff on \nimproving  the  integration  of  social  and  gender  mainstreaming  features  into  future  project \ndesigns; and (iii) targeting 50% participation of women in community awareness campaigns on \nsexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. \n \n30.  HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and labor. The prevalence of HIV and human trafficking \nin the project area is low, and public information on human trafficking is not available. The \nmajority of people (92%) surveyed during project preparation were aware of HIV transmission, \nprotection practices, and detection programs in Phuentsholing. However, given that the project \nis  located  in  a  border  area,  community  awareness  campaigns  on  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking will be conducted as part of the project, and the contractor will conduct HIV/AIDS \nawareness sessions for its labor force. Moreover, the labor force will benefit from government \nprograms under the National AIDS Control Program. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is categorized as C for \ninvoluntary resettlement as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Due diligence of \nsocial impacts of the road works concluded that the project will neither affect private assets nor \ncause physical or economic displacement. The road alignment is located on government land, \n ", "9 \nand field verification and consultations confirmed the absence of private assets within the \ncorridor of impact. The trade facilitation and logistics component does not have any resettlement \nimpacts. There are no indigenous people in the project area. The civil works under this project \nwill not affect any persons and the project is categorized as C for indigenous peoples. \n \n32.  Environmental impact. In accordance with the requirements of the Safeguard Policy \nStatement,  the  road  project  component  has  been  classified  as  environment  category  B. \nTherefore, an initial environmental examination, including an environmental management plan \n(EMP), has been prepared and disclosed on the ADB website. The main environmental impacts \nof the project are related to the construction of the 3.3 km embankment road that is 4\u20136 meters \nabove the existing ground level, of which about 1.0 km directly abuts the Amochu River bank. \nThe construction will require dredging, erosion protection works, and river training. Significant \nslope stabilization in the form of gabions, spur dikes, and river channels were incorporated in \nthe design to provide adequate toe and flank protection of the embankment road against the \nerosive force of the Amochu River. Although less severe, other impacts are related to the \nborrow area and the transport of material and should also be addressed. The environmental \nimpacts include deterioration of air quality from dust and vehicular emissions, increased noise \nlevel, vibration, deterioration of surface water quality, and occupational and community health \nand safety. Adequate mitigation measures are included in the EMP to address these impacts \nand will be an integral part of the bidding documents. The key long-term impacts of vehicular \nemissions will be managed through mandatory annual vehicular emission testing. Meaningful \nconsultations were conducted during the project preparation stage, and concerns of the affected \npersons and stakeholders were considered in the initial environmental examination and the \nEMP. The consultations were attended by representatives from key environmental agencies, \nroadside  communities,  and  nongovernment  organizations.  An  integrated  social  and \nenvironmental grievance redress mechanism has been formed to continue receiving feedbacks \nand complaints, if any, from affected parties, and to address them during the construction and \noperation stages. The project management unit for the Phuentsholing\u2013Chamkuna road will be \ncreated under the DOR, which will include an environmental specialist to supervise the effective \nimplementation of the EMP and the preparation of semiannual environmental monitoring reports \nfor public disclosure. The project management unit will be supported by the CSC who will \ninclude an environmental specialist in their team. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.14 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate coordination  A steering committee representing all the project-related government \namong relevant ministries and  institutions will be formed for project implementation, and regular \nproject executing agencies  meetings will be held twice a year, or as may be necessary. \nProject implementation delay  Detailed design and bidding for the road component and the trade \nfacilitation and logistics component will be conducted by existing CSCs \nunder the SASEC Road Connectivity Project (footnote 5).

An annual preventive maintenance plan to support the \nintended operation of the structures will be developed during the design \nstage. A CSC will provide continuous on-the-job training to DOR staff on \nimportant aspects of road design and asset management, and on key \naspects for the proper maintenance of climate-resilient structures. The \nDOR will work with the Ministry of Finance to set aside sufficient funding \nfor O&M as part of annual budget bids. \nCSC = construction supervision consultant, DOR = Department of Roads, O&M = operation and maintenance, \nSASEC = South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n34.  The  government,  the  DOR,  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n35.  The government, the DOR, and Phuentsholing Thromde have agreed with ADB on \ncertain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the financing and project agreements. \n \nV.
