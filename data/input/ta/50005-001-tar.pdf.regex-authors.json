INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance  (TA) from the  Asian  Development Bank  (ADB) for  the  Research  on Innovative \nMechanism for Open Agricultural Investment. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2016\u20132018 for the PRC.1 A TA reconnaissance mission was conducted on 10\u2013\n11 March 2016. Government concurrence with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference was obtained. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Agriculture has made significant contributions to the overall economic development of \nand has been the principal driver to alleviating rural poverty in the PRC. Once a key sector for \nthe rural economy, agriculture now lags far behind industrial production, resulting in a widening \ndisparity in rural\u2013urban livelihoods. The sector\u2019s decline can be attributed to insufficient and \npoor agricultural infrastructure, climate-related disasters, overutilization of natural resources, \npollution and degradation of ecosystems, low levels of technological development and adoption \nof  technology,  and  inadequate  finance  and  marketing  mechanisms.  The  agriculture  sector \nneeds  reform.  Modernizing  the  sector  to  strengthen  agricultural  productivity  and  market \nconnectivity to generate employment, increase incomes, and reduce inequality between rural \nand urban areas is a key action of the 13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, of the PRC.3 \n \n3.  Because the government has limited resources and expertise to meet growing demand \nfor investment from the agriculture sector, new approaches are required to stimulate growth and \nmodernize the sector. The government\u2019s National Agriculture and Rural Economic Development \nPlan, under the 13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 states that opening the agriculture sector is \nkey to agricultural modernization.4 Modernizing and opening agriculture requires an enhanced \nintroduction of investment, the involvement of private enterprises and leading state enterprises \nwith both capital and intellectual resources, the optimization of foreign and domestic investment, \nand the adoption and adaptation of advanced technology and equipment.  \n \n4.  Innovative  partnerships  that  bring  together  business,  government,  and  civil  society \nactors are increasingly being promoted as a mechanism to improve productivity and stimulate \ngrowth in the agriculture and food sectors. One such example is public\u2013private partnership \n(PPP), a mechanism for improving the delivery of public goods and services by forming a \npartnership with the private sector while retaining an active role for the government to ensure \nthat  national  socioeconomic  objectives  can  be  achieved.5 PPPs  can  promote  agricultural \ndevelopment through a potential leveraging of finances and risk sharing, and by providing \ninnovation and market access, and contributing to food security and inclusion. \n \n5.  PPP initiatives are common in sectors such as infrastructure, health, and education. \nTheir application in agriculture is relatively new and has been driven by the government\u2019s \ninability to deliver public services such as food security, infrastructure, environmental protection, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nand agricultural viability in rural areas. The PPP framework has been used to design market \nincentives  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  in  activities  that  would  otherwise  be \nconsidered to have marginal commercial value and/or to be high risk. In such situations where \nthe resources and complementary capacities of both public and private partners are combined \nunder a well-defined legal and regulatory framework, governments can obtain economic and \nsocial benefits from public investments that they could not achieve on their own because of \nlimited technical expertise, management skills and/or lack of resources. \n \n6.  State-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  reform,  such  as  consolidation,  commercialization, \nprivatization, or partial privatization, also offers additional opportunities to improve enterprise \nefficiency  and  competitiveness,  reduce  costs,  improve  service  delivery,  and  provide  better \noutcomes for the economy in terms of resource allocation and productivity. SOE reform can \nimprove  competitiveness  in  overseas  markets  and  open  potential  partnerships  with \ngovernments  and  foreign  companies. It  can  also  be  seen  as  a  process  with  increasing \naccountability, management independence, and profit orientation, which in turn can lead to \nagricultural modernization and stimulate sector growth. State and non-state agriculture-leading \nenterprises have important roles in agricultural modernization in the PRC, but more research is \nneeded to determine how they can best contribute to the process.6 \n \n7.  The agriculture sector needs to explore new partnerships, including opportunities for \nPPPs, SOE reform, and agriculture-leading enterprises, and how they can best be utilized to \nhelp stimulate the growth of and investment in the sector. Opening investment and promoting \ninnovative partnerships in agriculture would potentially help modernize the sector and deliver \nmultiple benefits that can contribute toward sustainable agricultural development, including for \nsmallholder  farmers.  The  four  common  agricultural  project  types  are  partnerships  for  (i) \ndeveloping agriculture value chains; (ii) joint agricultural research, innovation, and technology \ntransfer; (iii) building and upgrading market infrastructure; and (iv) the delivery of business \ndevelopment services to farmers and small- and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n8.  While research has shown evidence that opening the sector can promote investment \nand  that  innovative  partnerships  can  have  positive  contributions  to  sustainable  agricultural \ndevelopment  objectives,  several  outstanding  issues  associated  with  the  impact  of  such \npartnerships on poverty reduction and inclusion remain and need to be addressed. These key \nissues include the need to (i) provide sufficient evidence on innovative financial products; (ii) \nhave risk management strategies and inclusive investment models; (iii) have supporting policy \nrecommendations; (iv) increase the capacity of the public and private actors; (v) have a network \nof influential international investors; (vi) form closer links between private and public investors to \nenhance their development impact; and (vii) disseminate knowledge management for more \neffective interventions through websites, international forums, and technical events. \n \n9.  To understand the potential benefits and challenges of open agricultural investment and \ninnovative  partnerships,  this  policy  and  advisory  TA  will  review  opportunities  to  increase \nagricultural investments through innovative partnerships in the PRC, and propose sound policy \nrecommendations on how to improve agricultural investment and growth through innovative \ninvestment and a partnership mechanism. The TA will also prepare a road map to guide and \ndescribe the steps to be taken to prepare for and implement open investment and promote \ninnovative agricultural partnerships, and identify potential initiatives  for investment projects. \n                                                \n6  Agriculture-leading enterprises are agro-enterprises that have an important role in promoting the transition of \nagricultural development, promoting farmers\u2019 employment, and increasing incomes. They work with farmers to \ndevelop agricultural production with emphasis on specialization, standardization, scale, and intensification. \n ", "3 \nAside from the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), the TA\u2019s target policy audience may include \nplanning  and  sector  regulation  agencies  such  as  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission and the Ministry of Commerce. \n \n10.  Government policy and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy. The TA supports key \nissues of the PRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan, emphasizing the importance of development for rural \nareas to improve agricultural productivity, markets, and rural incomes. In line with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC, the TA supports inclusive economic growth as \none of the five strategic priorities.7 Support for rural development by improving access to finance \nand to private sector participation is a key action area. The TA aims to promote investments \nfrom private entities and partnerships, which represent an important source of capital and \nintellectual resources for agricultural development, to complement government and domestic \nprivate investments. The TA will address important objectives of ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for \nAgriculture and Natural Resources, 2015\u20132020 to improve (i) market connectivity and value \nchain links through agribusiness investment, and (ii) value chain development through financial \nintermediaries and direct investment.8 In line with the Public\u2013Private Partnership Operational \nPlan, 2012\u20132020, promoting private sector development as a driver of change in Asia and the \nPacific can generate greater economic growth in the region.9 \n \n11.  This proposed TA builds on previous studies on agricultural modernization and foreign \ninvestment in the PRC, which found that the main constraints to agricultural investments were \nthe lack of a partnership exchange platform and supporting policies. This TA will build upon this \nprevious work to study and propose pilot activities for innovative agricultural partnerships in the \nPRC, to stimulate agricultural investments and promote rural development.10 \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be an increased investment in the agriculture sector. The outcome will be \na strengthened mechanism and policy framework to improve open agricultural investment. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Output  1:  Agriculture sector  diagnostic  assessment  conducted. This diagnostic \nassessment will cover (i) technical issues; (ii) legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks; (iii) \ninstitutional  and  capacity  status;  and (iv)  commercial, financial,  and economic  issues. The \ndiagnostic  will  assess  the  status  quo  and  identify  gaps  and  weaknesses  in  implementing \nagricultural partnerships. Stakeholder consultation will be a key component of the diagnostic \nassessment, which will include international and national experiences. The assessment will \nallow the government to evaluate its current environment for partnerships and will be the basis \nfor determining what activities are required to promote agricultural partnerships. The diagnostic \nreport will form the basis for work to be carried out under outputs 2 and 3. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2016.

Output  2:  Recommendations  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  an  open \ninvestment mechanism created. Using the diagnostic assessment, a strategy to guide the \ndirection for an investment road map will be developed. The strategy will set out how proposed \npartnerships can help achieve sector goals and will describe the steps to be taken to prepare for \nand implement partnerships. The investment road map will clarify the operating environment to \nprivate sector operators and the required commitment from the government. The final product \nwill be the agricultural partnership road map. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Policy  recommendations  for  open  investment  and  partnerships  in \nagriculture formulated. To support the implementation of the proposed open investment and \npartnerships, an enabling environment where policies and regulations are in place to allow and \nsupport partnerships is required. This output will be an integral component of the road map and \nwill  propose  recommendations  for  policy  and  regulatory  requirements  that  will  support  the \nimplementation of various partnerships to increase agricultural investments. \n \n16.  Output  4:  Awareness  about  and  capacity  to  implement  open  investment  and \npartnerships in agriculture enhanced. Stakeholder understanding, buy-in, and acceptance of \nvarious  forms  of  partnerships,  including  PPPs,  are  crucial  requirements  to  implement \npartnerships successfully. Workshops will be held to engage stakeholders, seek their input and \nfeedback on analytical work, and introduce them to the role and benefits of various forms of \nagricultural partnerships. The findings of the TA research will be presented at a conference to \nraise awareness and build capacity, and will be captured in a knowledge product report that will \nbe widely disseminated. \n \n17.  The design of the proposed TA assumes that the government is committed to pursuing \nthe market economy approach and opening the agriculture sector to attract private investment \nand engage in partnerships, and therefore is willing to assess the role of the public sector as an \nimportant  strategy  to  achieve  agricultural  modernization.  To  address  the  risk  of  limited \ngovernment  commitment,  the  TA  project  design  includes  awareness  raising  and  capacity \nbuilding for government agencies to implement open investment and partnerships in agriculture. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of remuneration and travel expenses of counterpart staff \n(including a translator); local transport for TA consultants to government offices in Beijing; \nprovision  of  available  relevant  government  data  and  studies  for  the  TA  consultants\u2019  use; \nprovision of meeting rooms, office facilities, and geographic information system maps; and other \nin-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MOA will be the executing agency and its Foreign Economic Cooperation Center (FECC) \nwill be the implementing agency. FECC will be responsible for (i) coordinating with other MOA \ndepartments, such as the Department of Planning and Development and the Department of \nInternational Cooperation; other government agencies, such as the National Development and \nReform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce; and provincial agriculture departments for \nguidance on the studies, policy dialogues, and dissemination of outputs; (ii) carrying out day-to-\nday TA activities, such as overseeing the TA consultants\u2019 work, conducting domestic reviews of \n ", "5 \nTA outputs, and holding TA review workshops; and (iii) organizing a conference for output \ndissemination and knowledge sharing. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 16 months, tentatively from 1 November 2016 to 28 \nFebruary 2018. A consulting firm will provide 24 person-months of national inputs (agricultural \neconomist  and  team  leader,  agribusiness  and  value  chain  specialist,  agricultural  policy \nspecialist, investment and finance specialist, and institutional and planning specialist) and 3 \nperson-months of international inputs (investment and partnership specialist). The consultants \nwill submit progress reports, which will be reviewed by ADB and the government. All reports will \nbe written in English and translated into Chinese. The outline terms of reference for consultants \nis in Appendix 3. Resource persons may be invited to review the consultants\u2019 outputs and share \nknowledge during workshops and conferences. \n \n21.  The consulting firm will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 by inviting biodata technical proposals. In line with the action plan for \nthe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,11 an output-based contract will be offered. The proceeds \nof the TA will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  The TA results will be disseminated through project reports, workshops, and ADB and \nFECC media releases. A knowledge product will be developed and electronic copies will be \ndisseminated by ADB, ADB's PRC Resident Mission, and FECC, as well as through posting on \nthe ADB website. A conference with about 60 participants will be organized to disseminate the \nTA outputs and share knowledge. The target participants include government officials from \nMOA, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Commerce, and local \nagriculture departments; representatives from domestic and foreign enterprises in the PRC; and \nnational  and  international  experts  on  open  agricultural  investment. The  policy  note  will  be \nsubmitted to relevant government agencies for their awareness and for policy reform. Evaluation \nof the TA outcome will follow ADB guidelines and will be provided to FECC. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China for the Research on Innovative Mechanism for Open Agricultural \nInvestment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2014.
