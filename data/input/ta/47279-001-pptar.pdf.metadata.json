The Government of the Province of Sindh, Pakistan, requested ADB to help improve the \nurban  transport  system  (UTS)  of  Karachi  and  provide  technical  and  financial  support  to \nimplement  a  bus  rapid  transit  (BRT)  corridor and  strengthen  institutions  and  organizations \nmanaging the urban transport sector. The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will \nbuild on feasibility studies for priority BRT corridors undertaken by the Japan International \nCooperation Agency (JICA) for the Green and Red lines and the government for the Yellow line, \nand on advance preparation activities undertaken under an ADB Cluster TA. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The PPTA will have the main following outputs: (i) policy reform framework and support \nto on-going institutional and organizational development in the urban transport sector in Sindh, \nsuch as establishing the Sindh Mass Transit Company (SMTC) and progressively setting up the \nSindh Mass Transit Coordination Authority (SMTCA) to undertake planning, coordination, and \nregulation of all mass transit systems in Karachi;1 (ii) optimized preliminary design and updated \ncost estimates, including drawings at sufficient level of details to be taken up for detail design;2 \n(iii)  assessment  of  opportunity  to  integrate  intercity  bus  depots  and  off-street  parking \ncomponents in the project scope, and preliminary design of such components; (iv) full due \ndiligence  for  the  selected  BRT  line  and  associated  infrastructures;3 (v)  detailed  terms  of \nreference (TOR) of consulting services under project design advance (PDA) and under the loan; \n(vi)  public-private  partnership (PPP)  assessment to  identify  viable  PPP  options,  leading to \ntransaction advisory services (TAS) to assist the government in the delivery of selected PPP \nscheme(s), if any; (vii) final project financing plan; (viii) indicative implementation schedule; (ix) \nprocurement strategy and plan; (x) stakeholders\u2019 engagement through inclusive design and \nawareness campaigns; (xi) parking strategy, street vendors\u2019 policy and other traffic rules along \nthe corridor; and (xii) urban development strategy along the corridor, following the transit-\noriented development concept.

The soon-to-be established Sindh Mass Transit Company (SMTC) will be evaluated in \nterms of staffing capacity, organizational and administrative setup, evidence of transparency and accountability, \nand filing systems. If risks are identified, PPTA will propose an action plan to minimize those risks, mainly through \ncapacity building. A security risk assessment will also be conducted to take into account Karachi\u2019s specific context.  \n ", "10  Appendix 4 \n3.
