THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Urban Transport Electrification Project. \nThe report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the High-Level \nTechnology Fund for the Urban Transport Electrification Project, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the \nadministration of the grant. \n \n2.  The proposed project will jumpstart a long-term transition towards a zero tailpipe-emission \ntransport sector in the Kyrgyz Republic. It will comprise four interlinked outputs: (i) zero-emission \ntailpipe bus fleet in Bishkek municipality upgraded, (ii) bus depot infrastructure upgraded, (iii) pilot \ngreen mobility corridor established, and (iv) Bishkek bus operation sustainability improved. The \nproject is economically justified by the reduced need for fossil fuel imports, vehicle operating cost \nsavings, better air quality, and reduced carbon emissions, which will promote energy security, \nimprove public health, and contribute to climate change mitigation. The project will also make \nBishkek more livable and foster gender equity. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Background and Issues. The Kyrgyz Republic is rich in renewable energy resources. It \nproduces more than 91% of its electricity from hydropower and, despite its vast hydropower \ncapacity of 3,068 megawatts, untapped technical potential is estimated to be more than 10 times \nthis amount.1 Despite its wealth in hydro resources, the Kyrgyz Republic is heavily dependent on \nthe import of fossil fuels in the residential, transport, and industrial sector, with about 90% of the \ncountry\u2019s domestic demand for gasoline, diesel, and compressed natural gas (CNG) being \nimported. In 2019, the Kyrgyz Republic spent more than $900 million or 11.1% of its national \ngross domestic product on the import of fossil fuels, exposing the country to significant price \nfluctuations in the international oil and gas markets. \n \n4.  Bishkek, the capital and economic center of the Kyrgyz Republic, accounts for 40% of the \ncountry\u2019s gross domestic product, and is home to one-sixth of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s population. \nSince 2000, the city has experienced an average annual population growth rate of 1.5%, reaching \n1.02 million inhabitants in 2019. This growth has brought a rapid increase in motorization, fuel \nconsumption, and traffic congestion resulting in combustion emissions of local air pollutants and \ngreenhouse gases (GHGs).  \n \n5.  Since 2005, passenger car density in Bishkek has quintupled, with 480,000 of the 1.2 million \nregistered vehicles nationwide located in the capital region.2 From 2011 to 2016, the national \nconsumption  of  petroleum  products  and  CNG  increased  by  27.8%,  underlining  the  growing \neconomic burden and fuel import dependency caused by the country\u2019s resource-intensive transport \nsector.3 As most vehicles are more than 20 years old and run on low-quality fuel without regular \ntechnical inspections, the increase in urban motor vehicles has led to a significant deterioration in \nair quality. In 2018, during the nonheating season, the average concentration of major air pollutants \nsuch as nitrogen dioxide (NO ) and fine particulate matter of less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter \n2\n \n1  International Energy Agency. 2020. Kyrgyzstan Country Report: Energy Profile. Paris (April). \n2  From 2005 to 2018, passenger car density in the city increased from 61 to 332 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants. \n3  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD).  2019.  Promoting  Clean  Urban  Public \nTransportation and Green Investment in Kyrgyzstan. Paris. \n \n ", "2 \n(PM2.5) reached a monthly mean of 55.7 microgram per cubic meter (\u03bcg/m3) for NO2 and 16.7 \u03bcg/m3 \nfor PM2.5\u2014far exceeding the air quality guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO).4 In \nDecember 2020, air quality in Bishkek was rated as very unhealthy, with recorded PM levels of \n2.5 \n184 \u00b5g/m\u00b3; a value more than 18 times above the WHO recommended air quality threshold.  \n \n6.  The transport sector is responsible for 75% of air pollution in Bishkek (footnote 3), and \nWHO estimates that outdoor air pollution causes about 400 premature deaths annually.5 As buses \ncause about half of transport-related PM  and NO  emissions in Bishkek, the public transport \n2.5 2\nsegment has been identified as a major contributor to air pollution.6 \n \n7.  A major reason for the high emission contribution of public transport is the large number \nof outdated minibuses, which dominate public transport in the capital.7 Following the collapse of \nthe Soviet Union, chronic underfunding has led to the downsizing of the city\u2019s municipality-owned \nlarge bus fleet\u2014resulting in the rapid emergence of private sector minibus operators.8 Since 1989, \nthe number of municipality-operated large buses has declined from 617 to 313 units. In contrast, \nminibuses operating in the city have increased from 450 to more than 4,071 vehicles during the \nsame period, aggressively taking over routes from public service providers.9 Compared with 1989, \nminibus operators have expanded their services from 20 routes to 106 routes, while the route \nsystem covered by the two municipality-owned companies has decreased from 66 routes to \n25 routes (footnote 9). Despite passengers\u2019 preference for the safer, more comfortable, and \nlower-cost large public buses, the lack of vehicles, reduced service frequency, and limited routes \nhave forced passengers onto the expanding fleet of minibuses. \n \n8.  On national level, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s transport sector accounts for 28% of national \nGHG emissions. As the country has a very low grid emission factor (0.13 kilograms of carbon \ndioxide [CO ] per kilowatt-hour), electrification of the sector could contribute significantly to the \n2\ncountry\u2019s climate target of reducing GHG emissions by 11.5%\u201313.8% by 2030 compared with \nbusiness as usual (footnote 3). The project will contribute to help the Kyrgyz Republic meet its \nnational determined contributions under the Paris Climate Agreement.  \n \n9.  Government Strategy. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic intends to capitalize its \nhydro-dominated clean energy sector to help address the highly polluting urban transport sector \nin Bishkek, with the objective to decrease the transport sector\u2019s GHG, PM2.5 and NO2 emissions. \nTo reach this aim, the government has declared the transition to environment-friendly modes of \ntransport as one of its top policy priorities in its National Development Strategy, 2018\u20132040.10 To \nstimulate the adoption of electric vehicles, numerous tax and duty exemptions on electric vehicles \nand related charging infrastructure have been proposed and implemented. In addition, the \ngovernment introduced a preferential electricity tariff for public electric vehicle charging in March \n2020. \n \n10.  Alignment  with  ADB  Strategy  2030.  The  project  is  designed  with  cross-sectoral \ncollaboration in the energy-urban transport nexus and is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n \n4  WHO\u2019s air pollutant thresholds are as follows: NO2 (40 \u03bcg/m3 annual mean) and PM2.5 (10 \u03bcg/m3 annual mean). \n5  United Nations Industrial Development Organization. 2019.

The project will focus on four out of seven operational priorities by (i) tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (ii) \nmaking cities more livable; (iii) accelerating progress in gender equality; and (iv) strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.11 \n \n11.  ADB and Development Partner Engagement. ADB to date has been assisting with \nimprovement of the reliability of existing infrastructure as well as the rehabilitation of major \nhydropower plants, and national transmission and distribution network. In the urban transport \nsector, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has supported the \nBishkek  Municipal  Government  by  procuring  a  total  of  131  large  trolleybuses.  The  limited \ninterventions of EBRD since 2011 have not been able to stop the trend of an increasingly \ndominant role of privately-operated minibuses in Bishkek\u2019s public transport sector.  \n \n12.  Lessons learned. The project design incorporates lessons from past assistance, notably \nthe need for (i) strong political support and consensus, (ii) thorough project preparation to achieve \nreadiness before project approval, (iii) trainings on new technology involved in battery electric \nbuses (BEBs) and charging infrastructure, as well as (iv) the provision of capacity building and \nconsistent monitoring to ensure compliance with the safeguard requirements of ADB.12 \n \n13.  Private Sector Engagement. Private sector opportunities are being sought on the project \nto enhance the financial sustainability of the bus system. In particular, private sector contracts are \nbeing pursued for: (i) advertising both at the bus shelters as well as inside and outside the \nvehicles; and (ii) commercial kiosk rental at the bus shelters. In addition, the project will be \ninvestigating the potential to commercialize the placement of mobile or broadband antennae on \nsystem infrastructure, including shelters and the new street lighting. The potential privatization of \nan on-street parking management system is another area being investigated for system revenue \ngeneration. \n \n14.  In phase 1 of the project, the electric bus operations will be delivered by the state-owned \ntrolleybus company, the Bishkek Trolleybus Department (BTD). This arrangement will ensure \noperational integration and continuity. However, ADB is already engaging with the government \non a phase 2 project in which electric vehicle development will be widened to private sector actors, \nincluding potentially both private taxi operators and private marshrutka (van service) operators.  \nThus, as the project proceeds, opportunities for private sector participation will likely increase, \nalong with the introduction of gross-based contracting and other business model innovations. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: transition to environment-friendly modes \nof transport promoted (footnote 10). The project will have the following outcome: environmental, \nhealth, and economic impacts of Bishkek\u2019s public transport sector reduced.13 \n \n16.  Output  1:  Zero-emission  tailpipe  bus  fleet  in  Bishkek  municipality  upgraded. \nOutput 1 will encompass the procurement of (i) 120 modern BEBs; (ii) 35 100kW and 35 300 kW \nchargers, including cabling, electrical and civil works; and (iii) substation infrastructure. All BEBs \n \n11 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n12 ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "4 \nwill include universal accessibility design features to serve the needs of disabled and elderly \npassengers as well as women with children. In addition, BEBs will be equipped with security \nfeatures, such as cameras and panic buttons, to cater to the needs of female and vulnerable \npassengers. \n \n17.  Output 2: Bus depot infrastructure upgraded. In at least one existing trolleybus depot \nadditional weather-protected parking facilities, and rain shields for charging infrastructure will be \nestablished to accommodate the fleet of 120 BEBs. In addition, pavement improvements will be \nimplemented. \n \n18.  Output 3: Pilot green mobility corridor established. A BEB pilot corridor will be \nestablished to reduce congestion in the city center, demonstrate improved traffic and parking \nmanagement, and increase bus speed and service reliability. This output consists of (i) the \nprovision of a dedicated busway lane which will increase average commercial bus speeds from \n15 km per hour to 20 km per hour; (ii) improvements to at least three traffic junctions, including \nimprovements to signalization synchronization, signage and road markings, and safe pedestrian \ncrossings; and (iii) introduction of a new parking policy along the length of the corridor. The parking \npolicy will address (i) the physical formalization of parking infrastructure, especially along the \ndemonstration corridor; (ii) management and revenue collection of on-street parking; and, (iii) \npotential application of a parking levy on off-street, non-residential parking as a future revenue \nsource for the overall public transport system. The parking policy is key to the overall project for \ntwo reasons: (i) existing uncontrolled parking conditions will interfere with the safe and reliable \noperation of the dedicated bus services on the demonstration corridor; and (ii) parking represents \na potential revenue source that can be hypothecated to the public transport system to ensure \nongoing financial sustainability. \n \n19.  Output 4: Bishkek bus operation sustainability improved. Output 4 will support the \nmunicipality in improving its management of urban mobility and the efficiency and financial \nsustainability of public transport operations through (i) the reduction of operational expenditures \nper vehicle-km travelled by 10%; (ii) an enhanced institutional framework and urban mobility \nmanagement system; (iii) development of a transport demand model to allow better route and \noperational decision making; (iv) professionalization of the business model including revenues \nfrom private sector opportunities in advertising, commercial sales, and parking management; (v) \ndelivery of capacity-development training sessions on electric bus operation and maintenance, \ninfrastructure maintenance, and business opportunity development, with at least 20% of the \ntraining participants being women; (vi) knowledge and skill development of bus drivers and \nconductors to handle incidents of violence against women and other vulnerable groups; and (vii) \nan employment priority program to ensure at least 20% of the bus drivers are women.    \n \n20.  The proposed modernization of Bishkek\u2019s large bus fleet, with state-of-the-art large BEBs, \nis a move to address the chronic issues of public buses to enable a shift away from the unsafe, \novercrowded, and highly polluting minibuses. \n \n21.  By replacing 95 diesel and 25 outdated trolleybuses with BEBs, the project will result in \nan annual net energy import savings of $1,080,000 and economic benefits of $538,000 million \n(including $86,000 in health benefits). Following the successful deployment of the initial batch of \nBEBs, the project foresees a modular scale-up of up to 130 additional BEBs. In this initial \nprocurement, though, no minibuses or vans will be replaced, and thus no livelihood impacts for \nthe  industry  are  expected.  The  project  will  initiate  progressive  electrification  of the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s transport sector and, because of its distinctive long-term economic, environmental, \nand urban transport-related benefits, will have a lasting positive impact on the country. \n \n ", "5 \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n22.  Building on ADB\u2019s earlier engagement in the energy sector, which particularly focused on \nthe expansion of renewable power generation and improvement of the national grid system \nreliability, this project will add benefit by enabling the public transport sector to utilize domestically \nproduced clean electricity in the hitherto fossil-fuel dominated public transport fleet. Moreover, the \nproject  will  provide  institutional  reform  recommendations  to  improve  the  efficiency  and \ncoordination of the fragmented Bishkek public transport system. ADB will ensure best practices \nin project design and implementation by mobilizing leading international experts in BEB systems \nand by building up a skilled labor force for the O&M of BEB vehicle fleets. The project is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018\u20132022 and the country \noperations business plan for the Kyrgyz Republic, 2021\u20132023 as well as ADB\u2019s sustainable \ntransport initiative.14 \n \n23.  The project will demonstrate that the implementation of a state-of-the-art BEB fleet, in \ncombination with the planned pilot corridor, is a viable option to (i) promote energy security, while \nreducing the economic burden incurred by fuel imports; (ii) reduce air pollutants and GHG \nemissions of Bishkek\u2019s public transport system; (iii) improve public health; (iv) reduce congestion \nin the city center; and (v) improve the ridership of environment-friendly large buses. \n \n24.  The project will promote gender equality and include the following gender elements: (i) \ndesignated seats for women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities; (ii) sufficient \nspace for baby strollers and wheelchairs; (iii) security features, such as panic buttons; (iv) onboard \nCCTV cameras; (v) an information campaign against violence and the harassment of women; and \n(vi) training of bus drivers on conduct in cases of violence, sexual harassment, and crimes against \nwomen. To promote gender equality at the company level, the BTD has committed to ensure that \nat least 20% of BEB bus drivers and 40% of technicians are female. \n \n25.  Despite the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, supply chains for BEBs and \nchargers are robust. Passenger demand in Bishkek for trolleybus and bus services fell by 47% \n(reduction of 28.9 million passenger trips) from 2019 to 2020 due to the ongoing pandemic. The \nprovision of the new BEB fleet and the dedicated busway corridor will assist in recovering this \ndemand in the post-pandemic period through more frequent services and time savings. Given \nboth the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the likely specter of future pandemics, the project\u2019s \nbeneficial air quality impact will contribute to decreased incidence of respiratory diseases, thus, \nindirectly relieving the public health system, as air pollution is a recognized aggravator of \nrespiratory illness.15 Moreover, the utilization of spacious BEBs will provide a more secure travel \noption for passengers than crowded minibus services. \n \nD.

The BMO, which will act as the \nproject\u2019s executing agency, will provide the proceeds of the loans and grants as grants to the two \nimplementing agencies: the BTD and the Urban Transport Department (UTD). The BTD will be \nresponsible for the implementation of outputs 1 and 2, while the UTD will be in charge of outputs 3 \nand 4. The Department of Transport and Municipal Property under the BMO will serve as the project \nmanagement unit (PMU). The PMU\u2019s responsibilities include overseeing the project implementation \nactivities  of  the  two  implementing  agencies,  procurement,  contract,  and  overall  project \nadministration, as well as safeguard compliance and reporting.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n32.  A detailed comparative analysis of different technologies was conducted, evaluating the \ntechnical, environmental, and economic performance of diesel, CNG, conventional and hybrid \ntrolleybuses, and slow- and fast-charging BEBs. The analysis was made based on the climatic, \nroute, and operational conditions of public transport operators in Bishkek; and it identified fast-\ncharging BEBs as the most suitable technology option. \n \n33.  Since hydropower produces more than 91% of electricity in the Kyrgyz Republic, the \nproject will have significant positive energy security, air quality, and climate benefits. Depending \non the time of the year, BEBs can be run up to 100% by renewable electricity. In comparison with \ndiesel and CNG buses, which are major sources of PM and NOx, BEBs (i) have zero combustion \n2.5 \nemissions of these pollutants; (ii) have up to 40% lower operation and maintenance (O&M) costs; \n(iii) have a longer lifetime; and (iv) with a high renewable energy share in the power mix, facilitate a \nlong-term decarbonization of the transport sector.18 From a GHG perspective, BEBs exhibit the \nlowest well-to-wheel CO  emissions of all evaluated technologies.19 On an annual basis, the \n2\nproject will mitigate 10,800 tons of CO  equivalent and will contribute to improved air quality by \n2\nreducing the emission of 2 tons of PM and 98 tons of NOx per year.20 \n2.5 \n \n34.  The project supports technological innovation in the Kyrgyz Republic and will improve the \nefficiency and stability of the power system and the safety of the public transport system. The \nstate-of-the-art battery technology and its fast-charging capability will allow for a maximum degree \nof operational flexibility. BEBs can be recharged from 20% to 80% of battery state of charge in \nless than 30 minutes. Compared with the trolleybus system, BEBs (i) are 60% more energy-\nefficient; (ii) are beneficial to the power system during electricity shortages, as BEBs are only \nrecharged during off-peak hours; (iii)  can operate independent from the existing trolleybus \ncatenary system; (iv) are less affected by localized blackouts; and (v) assuming a full transition to \na 100% BEB system, will make costly investments of an estimated $31 million into the dilapidated \ncatenary system and supporting substations redundant.21 \n \n35.  Fast-charged BEB systems are a proven technology that have been used worldwide in \ncities with similar climatic conditions, such as Beijing (11,000 units) and Harbin (600 units) in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, and Helsinki in Finland (51 units). BEBs and charging infrastructure \nspecifications have been adapted for cold winter conditions in Bishkek. The implementing agency, \nBTD, has extensive experience in the O&M of trolleybus systems, facilitating the transition toward \n \n18 Diesel (Euro V) combustion emissions are 9.24 grams per kilometer (g/km) for NOx and 0.07 g/km for PM2.5. CNG \nbuses emit about 4.84 g/km of NOx and 0.01 g/km of PM2.5. \n19 BEBs emit approximately 140 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilometer (gCO2e/km). Conventional public \ntransport technologies feature the following emissions: Diesel \u2013 Euro V (1,490 gCO2e/km), CNG (2,010 gCO2e/km), \nnew conventional trolleybuses (170 gCO2e/km), and hybrid trolleybuses (170 gCO2e/km). \n20 GHG and air pollutant reductions are based on the assumption of replacing 95 Euro II diesel and 25 operating \nconventional trolleybuses with BEBs. \n21 The estimate assumes an upgrade of 218 km of overhead lines (single line), including posts and 19 supporting \nsubstations. \n \n ", "9 \nBEBs. To ensure the smooth adoption of this related technology, the project includes a 3-year \nmaintenance contract with the bus manufacturer, which will provide extensive O&M training on \nBEBs and charging infrastructure for BTD technical staff. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n36.  The project\u2019s economic and financial viability was assessed following ADB guidelines.22 \nFast-charging BEBs have the lowest total costs of ownership (TCO) in the context of Bishkek\u2019s \nbus operations (footnote 6). The higher initial capital expenditure of BEBs is recovered because \nof their significantly lower energy and maintenance costs as well as the longer useful life of BEBs \ncompared with fossil-fuel buses. The cost\u2013benefit analysis was based on a comparison of an \ninvestment in BEBs with a baseline of 95 diesel and 25 conventional trolleybuses. The economic \nanalysis includes (i) the procurement of the BEB fleet, (ii) charging infrastructure including grid \nupgrades, (iii) bus depot upgrades, (iv) the e-bus pilot corridor, and (v) related consulting services. \n \n37.  The project is economically viable and, with an estimated economic internal rate of return \nof 10.4%, is above the benchmark of 9.0%. The direct economic benefits of electric buses are \nreduced  expenditures  on  energy  and  maintenance  totaling  $1.82  million  per  year.  Indirect \nmonetized benefits worth an annual average of $664,000 include (i) reduced air pollution (PM , \n2.5\nSO , and NOx, based on local health cost estimates); (ii) reduced GHG emissions (based on the \n2\nsocial cost of carbon); and (iii) decreased noise. The economic benefits of the pilot green mobility \ncorridor are based on time savings and are estimated at $493,000 annually. A sensitivity analysis \nover  a range  of  parameters  and  price  change  fluctuations  demonstrates  that  the  project\u2019s \neconomic viability is robust. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return remains above the \nbenchmark, with a 13% increase in e-bus investment, a 41% increase in capital expenditure of \ncharging infrastructure including grid connection, a 192% increase in capital expenditure of bus \ndepot upgrades, a 117% increase in electricity usage or prices, a 31% decline in economic \nbenefits, and a 41% decline in time savings. \n \n38.  The financial analysis, assuming adequate subsidy funding from the government to bridge \na deficit in the tariff for full cost recovery, confirmed the project\u2019s financial viability, yielding an entity-\nlevel financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for BTD of 3.9% and a project-level FIRR of 5.2%, which \ncompare favorably with the estimated 3.3% weighted average cost of capital (WACC). To ensure a \nrobust result, a separate sensitivity analysis was conducted, increasing by 5% and 10% the \nfollowing: (i) WACC, (ii) capital expenditure, (iii) energy cost, and (iv) labor cost. The analysis \nconcluded that the entity-level FIRR for BTD is generally more susceptible to increases in capital \nexpenditure and labor costs, and heavily dependent on the government\u2019s subsidies in adequate \ncash funding and electricity tariff support. In the case of no-subsidy scenario, the BTD\u2019s FIRR of \n2.2% is potentially below WACC\u2014meaning, without subsidies the project is not financially viable. \nTo safeguard the project\u2019s financial viability, relevant covenants have been included under the \nloan agreement of the project, committing the government to maintain the current level of \nsubsidies. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n39.  Bishkek\u2019s public bus segment is highly fragmented, consisting of the two municipality-\nowned public transport companies and a multitude of private van and minibus operators, which \nare poorly coordinated. Public transport services are currently regulated by the UTD, which \n \n22 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila; and ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence: A \nMethodology Note. Manila. \n \n ", "10 \noversees  route  licensing  and  system  quality.  Project  consultants  will  support  the  capacity \ndevelopment of UTD through training and other knowledge management activities. In addition, \nthe project consultants will evaluate the institutional alternatives for the future, including the \npotential introduction of a transport authority, which would have broader planning and system \nmanagement oversight. Only existing bus services are being upgraded with the new BEB \nvehicles. The existing van and minibus operators are unaffected by this initial procurement of \nBEBs (i.e., no route permits are removed for the van and minibus operators and thus no livelihood \nissues or crowding out of the private sector are expected). Compared with the other technologies, \nBEBs have (i) the lowest TCO per km, (ii) no tailpipe emissions (PM  and NOx), and (iii) very \n2.5\nlow  levels  of  GHG  emissions.  Supported  by  various  government  incentive  schemes  and \nsubsidies, BEBs are not only ecologically but also financially and economically sustainable; and, \nwith adequate institutional capacity improvements and reforms, BEBs will make bus operators \nless dependent on government subsidies in the long term. The project includes a 3-year O&M \nprogram,  with  capacity  building  to  reinforce  and  maintain  the  capacity  of  public  transport \noperators. Recurrent cost analysis has shown that, during project implementation, O&M costs are \nexpected to decrease gradually, progressively reducing the reliance on government subsidies. \nMoreover, a budget analysis of the BMO has shown that historical and projected transportation \ncosts were budgeted in excess of actual O&M costs, leaving sufficient fiscal headroom. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n40.  Financial  management.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is \nsubstantial mainly because of (i) weak internal and external audit arrangements in the internal \ncontrol framework; (ii) the relatively weak financial management capacity of the executing and \nimplementing agencies; (iii) the limited strength of finance and internal audit in the BMO, BTD, \nand UTD; (iv) the lack of experience of the executing and implementing agencies with ADB \nprojects; and (v) the required migration of project financial reports from Microsoft Excel to the 1C \naccounting information system.23 The executing and implementing agencies agreed with ADB on \na timebound financial management action plan and incorporated mitigation measures into the \nproject design. \n \n41.  Procurement  and  anticorruption.  The  project  procurement  risk  subject  to  the \nprocurement capacity of the BTD and the UTD was assessed following ADB\u2019s guidelines. The \nprocurement risk of the project is assessed high before mitigation measures, mainly because the \nimplementing agencies have limited experience related to foreign-assisted projects and ADB \nprocurement requirements.24 ADB will conduct regular training and capacity-building activities \nduring processing and implementation, provide expert support to both implementing agencies, \nand monitor procurement activities. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, the BMO, the BTD, and the UTD. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \nIntegrity due diligence was also conducted.25 The executing agency, the BMO, is part of the \ngovernment, and the implementing agency, the UTD (established in 2008), is a unit of the BMO; \nhence, both are exempt from integrity due diligence. No significant integrity risks were identified \nfor the BTD. \n \n \n23 Financial Management Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Procurement Risk Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 ADB. 2003.

Most of Bishkek\u2019s public transport trips are via vans and minibuses. Minibuses have a \nmaximum capacity of 18 passengers and charge fares that are 25%\u201340% higher than municipality-\nowned bus companies.26 Overcrowded minibuses do not provide sufficient safe seating space and \nexpose women, the elderly, and children to the dangers of harassment and accidents. Further, it is \nestimated that 93% of wheelchair users never use public transport because of access difficulties.27 \nThe project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Key gender design features of the \nproject that promote safe travel of women and other vulnerable groups are indicated in the gender \naction plan.28 \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n43.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.29 \n \n44.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE), including an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), covering outputs 1 and 2, has been prepared following \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement based on the preliminary design. The IEE shows that any \nimpacts  caused  by  construction  and  operation  will  be  site-specific,  short  in  duration,  not \nsignificant, and can be avoided and/or mitigated through measures identified in the EMP.30 The \nIEE will be updated based on detailed design and site-specific conditions. An environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF) was prepared and agreed with ADB to (i) guide the \nselection,  screening  and  categorization,  environmental  assessment,  preparation,  and \nimplementation of the safeguard plan of the pilot green mobility corridor (output 3), which will be \nprepared after Board approval; and (ii) facilitate compliance with the requirements specified in \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.31 The executing agency will engage qualified safeguard \nexperts to monitor the construction works and ensure the implementation of the EMP. Contractors \nwill be required to submit, as part of their bids, the expected costs for the implementation of the \nEMP and site-specific EMP to the executing agency before works start. Environmental reporting \nto ADB will be done on a semiannual basis and will continue until ADB issues the project \ncompletion report. All IEEs, the EARF, the EMPs, and corrective action plans (if any) will be \ndisclosed on the websites of ADB, and the executing and implementing agencies. Consultation \nand  public  participation  will  continue  throughout  implementation,  and  any  environmental \ngrievances will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress mechanism developed for \nthe project. \n \n \n26 Y.

An environmental assessment of the pilot green mobility corridor is required to \nfollow the procedures outlined in the EARF. The EARF will be reviewed regularly and, if necessary, updated during \nimplementation, e.g., if indicated by unanticipated new types of impacts (review of applicability and relevance) or if \nthere is any change in legal and regulatory framework. None of the provisions of the EARF will be relaxed or lowered \nin the subsequent revisions and updates. \n \n ", "12 \n45.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A social due diligence report (SDDR) has been \nprepared  covering  project components  related to  outputs  1  and  2.  Project  activities  under \noutputs 1 and 2 are expected to be phased first and be primarily conducted within existing right-\nof-way boundaries. These two outputs are not likely to trigger land acquisition and resettlement \n(LAR) impacts, which will be confirmed through an updated SDDR based on the detailed designs. \nThe SDDR also includes, on a sample basis, a rapid assessment of the pilot green mobility \ncorridor (output 3), which will be prepared after Board approval and may trigger some minor LAR \nimpacts.  Therefore,  a  LAR  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  further  screening  and \ninvoluntary resettlement planning following local laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  After  the  finalization  of  the  detailed  engineering  designs,  the  impact \nassessment will be updated for all components. If the assessments confirm that the pilot green \nmobility corridor (output 3) or any other output will have LAR impacts, the costs of acquiring land \n(if any) will be covered by the BMO, and approval will be sought for ADB\u2019s financing of the nonland \nportion of the LAR costs through the grant (for present planning purposes, a notional amount has \nbeen allocated from the grant to ringfence the financing for such costs). The social safeguards \nand resettlement specialist to be engaged by the executing agency will ensure the project\u2019s overall \nsocial safeguard compliance with support from the project supervision consultant, including (i) the \nupdate of the SDDR and/or preparation of a LAR plan (if any) upon finalization of the detailed \ndesigns, and (ii) compliance monitoring and reporting throughout project implementation. \n \n46.
