The Government of Nepal decided in 2003 to initiate comprehensive reforms in the \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  services  (WSSS)  sector,  including  institutional  reforms  in \nKathmandu Valley. The reforms are supported and financed under the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) Kathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Development Program (SDP, Loans \n2058/2059-NEP) loan package,1 under the overall framework of the Melamchi Water Supply \nProject (MWSP, Loan 1820-NEP),2 the umbrella project. The MWSP is a comprehensive water \nsupply improvement project that aims to improve the health and well-being of the people in \nKathmandu Valley by relieving the shortage of potable water. The SDP, the follow-on sector \ndevelopment program to the MWSP, is designed to complement the MWSP by supporting \ninstitutional reforms in the water services sector and by promoting a public-private partnership \n(PPP)3  model  in  water  services  delivery.  The  Government  has  completed  most  of  the \ninstitutional reform requirements agreed upon under the MWSP and the SDP.  \n \n2.   During the Loan Review Mission for the MWSP and the SDP in September 2007, the \nGovernment requested additional technical assistance (TA) from ADB to support the new utility \noperator, established as part of the agreed-upon institutional reform framework, in its initial \noperational  period.  The  aim  is  to  ensure  that  the  operator  has  the  required  operational \nenvironment,  corporate  structure,  and  resources  for  it  to  function  as  an  independent, \nautonomous, and commercially viable entity. Meetings were held with concerned officials of the \nMinistry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW), the Melamchi Water Supply Development \nBoard, the new utility operator\u2019s board members, and other key stakeholders involved in water \nservices delivery in Kathmandu Valley. A consensus was reached in principle on the goals, \npurpose, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for the TA. The TA4 framework is in Appendix 1. The concept was reviewed and \napproved by the ADB Management on 9 October 2007.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  A rapidly growing population, lack of investment in infrastructure in the urban water \nsupply and sanitation sector, absence of a clearly defined policy, and low institutional capacity   \nhave hampered the sector\u2019s sustainable development in Kathmandu Valley, resulting in chronic \ndrinking water shortages and inefficient service delivery. For an estimated population of 1.5 \nmillion in the Valley, the available water supply is equivalent to about 60 liters per capita per day \n(lpcd),5 of which 40% is still assumed to be unaccounted-for water. Supply is intermittent and \ninequitable, and ranges from 8 hours a day in some areas of the Valley to less than 2 hours \nevery  alternate  day  in  many  areas.  Such  chronic  shortage  of  water  supply  and  poor \nmanagement of the basic urban infrastructure are posing serious health risks to the urban \npopulation in the Valley. The burdens associated with these poor environmental conditions are \ndisproportionately borne by the poor. For instance, consumer surveys in the Valley indicate that \nan estimated 29% of households are not connected to the piped water supply network; of these, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n2  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Melamchi Water Supply Project. Manila. \n3  The term PPP is used in this paper to reflect the general economics of the  project and of this TA in which (i) KUKL \nis majority owned by the public sector and by private-sector (minority) investors; (ii) private-sector shareholders are \nrepresented on the Board by one director, along with three directors from the public sector and three independent \ndirectors selected on a competitive basis; and (iii) the proposed TA also intends to support and facilitate the \npotential outsourcing of parts of KUKL's operations to the private sector in the medium- to long-term future.  \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 October 2007. \n5  Asian standards show that for a city like Kathmandu, the water demand is generally above 150 lpcd.  ", " 2     \n60% are poor.6 The MWSP and the SDP (together known as the projects) seek to address \nthese issues. While the MWSP aims to solve the chronic water shortage by diverting water from \nthe  snow-fed  Melamchi  River  to  Kathmandu  Valley,7  the  SDP  seeks  to  develop  and \ninstitutionalize  a  comprehensive  institutional  and  regulatory  framework  for  efficient  and \nsustainable water services management. In an attempt to increase efficiency in service delivery, \nthe projects also sought to engage a private operator to manage and operate the water services \nunder a performance-based management contract (PBMC). \n \n4.  The Government has demonstrated its commitment to the agreed-upon reforms, despite \nthe extreme political instability with frequent changes of government and country-wide armed \nconflict in recent years, and has completed most of the institutional reforms agreed upon under \nthe projects, including the separation of asset ownership from management of the water utility, \nthe establishment of a regulatory commission for water tariffs, and the setting up of a fully \nindependent water services operator. As a result, the Kathmandu Valley operations of the Nepal \nWater Supply Corporation (NWSC), the public utility corporation, have already been split into \nthe  following  new  entities:  (i)  a  public  entity  called  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Supply \nManagement Board (KVWSMB), which holds assets, determines policies, awards and monitors \nlicences and contracts for water supply and wastewater services in Kathmandu Valley; (ii) an \nautonomous  limited  liability  company  called  the  Kathmandu  Upatyaka  Khanepani  Limited \n(KUKL), established under the Company Act with a majority of public shareholders, to take the \nresponsibility for water services operations in Kathmandu Valley; and (iii) the Water Supply \nTariff Fixation Commission (WSTFC), an independent regulatory body for the sector. Relevant \n8\nlaws  were already amended and newly enacted to establish the institutional reforms.  \n \n5.  However, in the past 6 years of implementing the MWSP and 3 years of implementing \nthe SDP, a number of major events and circumstances that occurred in Nepal and within the \nproject environment have changed the dynamics of the projects and constrained their overall \nimplementation. Among others, the Government\u2019s efforts in securing the private partner under \nthe PBMC failed. Past successive failures in engaging the private sector under a lease modality, \nand the recent failure under the PBMC have proven that even the PBMC is too difficult and \ncostly to process in the fluid political environment of Nepal despite several years of efforts. \nFurther, it has been agreed that trying the same private sector participation modality might fail in \nattracting interest from competent international players in the current context of continuing \npolitical instability in Nepal; the costs and uncertainties related to processing a re-tendering are \ntoo high. Therefore, considering the assessment of those factors, the weak institutional capacity \nto  process  the  re-tendering  of  PBMC,  and  the  best  practices  available  in  the  region,  the \nGovernment is proposing to revise the procurement modality to provide management support to \nKUKL and to move from the PBMC model to a consulting services package for a capacity-\nbuilding and public-private partnership support team (the CBP team),9 focusing on long-term \ncapacity building and strengthening of its management and operational resources. \n \n                                                 \n6  Measured as earning less than the official poverty line of NRs6,100 or about $85 per person per year. \n7 The first phase of the MWSP is designed to divert 170 MLD (million liters per day) of water from the Melamchi \nRiver through a 26-kilometer-long tunnel. Under the scheme, economical capacity expansions are feasible by \nextending the tunnel to tap the Yangri (second phase; 170 MLD) and Larke (third phase; 170 MLD) rivers, which \ncan ultimately provide a total of 510 MLD of additional water to Kathmandu Valley. \n8  The Water Supply Management Board Act (Act No. 21,2063 (2006)). The Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission \nAct (Act No. 29, 2063). The Nepal Water Supply Corporation (Third Amendment) Act (2063).   \n9  The proposed CBP team is being discussed by the Government and ADB as one of the alternatives to the failed \nPBMC. All references to the CBP Team should be read as representing this alternative rather than being the \nselected one. ", "                                  3\n6.  It  is  intended  that  KUKL  will  take  over  the  responsibilities  for  operating  the  water \nservices in Kathmandu Valley from the existing utility, NWSC, in January 2008. Besides its \nsupport through the projects, ADB has also been assisting the Government through TAs in \nsetting  up  the  necessary  institutional,  legal,  and  regulatory  frameworks  and  ensuring  that \nadequate start-up tools and resources are available to the entities at this critical transitional \nperiod. These include the TA 4096-NEP10 and TA 4776-NEP.11 The consultants engaged by \nthese TAs studied and developed the required institutional, regulatory, and legal framework for \nthe appropriate ownership, governance, and leadership structures for the new entities, and in \nsetting up their financial, legal, and managerial systems. While the main achievements of those \nTAs were development and enactment of the reformed institutional and regulatory framework to \nallow the new entities to be established, the proposed TA now intends to support their initial \noperations, capacity building, and management. Their respective capacities as a public asset \nowner, a service provider, and an independent sector regulator will be further supported by the \nproposed TA consultants and the CBP team under the SDP.  \n \n7.  Though a regulatory framework allowing water service management by an independent \nutility operator separate from the facility owner has been established, the potential issues lie \nwith the implementation of this framework and how to achieve the intended reform outcome to \nprovide efficient and sustainable water services in Kathmandu Valley while ensuring that KUKL \nfunctions as an independent, autonomous, and commercially viable utility operator. Further, the \nrecent failure in engaging a private operator for KUKL has created a situation where KUKL must \nstart operations soon, but the management advisory support to it will not be available for the \nnext 1.5 years until the recruitment process of the CBP team is completed. To mitigate the \nsituation and to build KUKL\u2019s capacity to operate the water services in the Valley for the initial \noperational period, the hiring of a small team of management advisors (the interim management \nadvisors or IMAs) is essential for a period of 18 months (the interim period).12 In light of the \nobjectives stated in the SDP and in particular the establishment of KUKL as a limited liability \ncompany under the provisions of the Company Act as opposed to a statutory entity, it is critical \nthat the independence and autonomy of KUKL be safeguarded and supported, and that the \nmomentum of these institutional reforms be maintained. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n8.  This advisory TA will assist the recently reformed water services sector and the new \nentities13 in (i) starting operations and initial capacity building to provide efficient and sustainable \nservices,  and  (ii)  setting  up  adequate  corporate  structure  and  operational  platforms  and \nproviding management support for the water services operator. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  desired  impact  is  the  improved  health  and  well-being  of  the  inhabitants  of  \nKathmandu Valley through efficient and adequate provision of water services. The outcome is to \nfoster  and  develop  the  appropriate  operational,  managerial,  and  institutional  capacity  for \nsustainable water services in the Valley. \n \n10.  The outputs of the TA will include the following:  \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2003, Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Kathmandu Valley Water Management Support \nProject.

Manila. \n12 During this interim period, no statutory managers are posted in KUKL while IMAs provide services to KUKL. \n13 KUKL is intended to be the beneficiary of the TA unless otherwise indicated in the TA paper. ", " 4     \n(i)  start-up management support to KUKL, including establishment of a functional \nproject management unit (PMU);  \n(ii)  preparation and setting up of the operational, accounting, quality control, and \nmanagement  systems  within  KUKL  for  day-to-day  service  delivery  and \nprocurement of equipment and works;  \n(iii)  procurement  of  consultancies  and  civil  works  for  the  identified  distribution \nnetwork demonstration scheme and immediate rehabilitation and improvement \nworks identified by the MWSP;  \n(iv)  preparation of plans and strategies, asset management and capital investment \nworks, accounting and information system, operating guidelines and procedures, \ncustomer services and pro-poor services management strategies for KUKL;  \n(v)  assessment of organizational, capacity building, and tariff reforms required for \nthe interim period;  \n(vi)  implementation of the distribution network demonstration scheme and immediate \nrehabilitation and improvement works identified by the MWSP; and \n(vii)  capacity  building  for  the  new  entities  through  training,  workshops,  seminars, \nbenchmark studies, etc.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will build on the existing projects and the previously associated TAs by bridging \nmanagement support to KUKL in the interim period while the CBP team is being recruited. The \nfundamental base, framework, and action plan of the institutional reforms have already been \ndeveloped  by  these  projects  and  TAs  and  are  now  being  duly  implemented.  Prior  to  the \nengagement of the IMAs, KUKL will have already acquired the operational assets and staff \ncurrently working for the Kathmandu Valley operations of the current utility, NWSC. The details \nof staff recruitment and rightsizing strategies for KUKL have already been developed based on \nextensive consultations with the stakeholders. The IMAs will assist KUKL in implementing the \nrecommendations  of  these  strategies  and  further  developing  them  to  enhance  the  overall \ncapacity of its staff.  They will also ensure that the required financial, corporate, and operational \nstructures are in place14 within KUKL for the interim period. In addition, ADB is providing a \ntransition management support team for 6 months, starting October 2007, to assist KVWSMB in \ntaking over the asset and liabilities and prepare KUKL for taking operational responsibilities from \n16 January 2008. It is expected that the transition management support team will overlap with \nand provide support to the proposed IMAs. \n \n12.  To ensure that KUKL is fully functional and operational, the IMAs will assess KUKL\u2019s \nlong-term  organizational  and  operational  needs  while  taking  into  account  the  studies  and \nrecommendations made by the previous TAs. After the assessment, they will prepare various \nplans and strategies covering human resources development, financial management, asset \nmanagement, capital investment works, quality assurance and quality control, computerization \nand information system, accounting system, customer billing and collection system, operational \nguidelines and procedures, customer service, and pro-poor service. The plans and strategies \nwill be translated into a detailed action plan to ensure that KUKL delivers the enhanced water \nservices  throughout  Kathmandu  Valley  in  an  effective,  efficient,  and  sustainable  manner. \nProvision of affordable water services to low-income consumer groups will be another key \nobjective of KUKL in its services delivery. The IMAs will support KUKL in implementing the \nalready designed subsidized tariff structure and systemize the overall pro-poor water services. \n \n                                                 \n14 A lot of preparatory works have been completed by the consultants engaged under the previous TA projects as \nmentioned above, and a team of consultants including a financial management specialist, a water supply specialist, \nand a legal specialist, are still engaged under TA 4776-NEP. ", "                                  5\n13.  The IMAs will also assist KUKL in setting up the PMU within KUKL to manage and \noversee all activities related to the projects. The board of directors of KUKL will appoint a full- \ntime project director who will head the PMU and authorize him/her as a signatory in withdrawing \nthe loan funds in coordination with ADB and subject to the terms of the loan agreements. While \nthe IMAs will manage preparation works for procurement of various consultancy, equipment \npurchase  and  civil  works  packages  relevant  to  the  demonstration  scheme  and  immediate \nrehabilitation and improvement works identified by the MWSP, the PMU will be responsible for \nassisting in procurement and seeking approval from KVWSMB and ADB, in accordance with \nrelevant ADB rules for the disbursement of funds and procurement of contracts. The IMAs will \nassist the PMU in preparing progress reports and other relevant documents for the projects.  \n \n14.  During the preparation of the institutional reforms in the sector, extensive consultations \nwere  carried  out  with  the  stakeholders,  including  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs), \nKUKL,and the IMAs, will continue the consultations as part of KUKL\u2019s public relations strategy. \nIn particular, plans for tariff reforms will be widely disseminated and discussed with consumer \nrepresentatives and NGOs, and issues raised by the stakeholders will be addressed.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $3,000,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $2,500,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the remaining costs of $500,000 equivalent by \nproviding  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  transport,  and  other  miscellaneous \nexpenditures. Details of the cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MPPW will be the Executing Agency and KUKL will be the Implementing Agency for the \nTA. The TA will be implemented over 18 months, from January 2008 to June 2009. Three \ninternational  consultants,  with  experience  in  managing  a  large-scale  water  utility,  will  be \nengaged as the IMAs (general management advisor, operational management advisor, and \nfinancial management advisor) for 18 person-months each. The IMAs will provide services as \nacting managers of the KUKL, as permitted under the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement and Articles of \nAssociation  of  KUKL  (2006)  for  the  interim  period,  and  will  be  selected  as  individuals,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Outline terms of reference for the IMAs are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  The IMAs are expected to start services on 16 January 2008. They will prepare a \nhandover  plan  outlining  the  operational  responsibilities,  key  issues  encountered,  updated \nfinancial status of KUKL, and progress on project implementation related to KUKL. After 18 \nmonths, they will hand over responsibilities to the CBP team, who are expected to begin their \nservices in July 2009 and assist KUKL for 4 years thereafter.  The sequencing of the IMAs, then \nthe CBP team, and the exploration of opportunities to contract out services to the private sector \nis designed to ensure KUKL\u2019s long-term capacity building and ability to gradually contract out \nservices delivery to the private sector. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n18.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,500,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Nepal for \nSupporting  Capacity  Development  for  Water  Services  Operations  and  Public-Private \nPartnership in Kathmandu Valley.

Introduction \n1.  These terms of reference outline the key tasks for the interim management advisors (IMAs) \nthat will be supporting the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL), a newly established \nlimited  liability  company  and  water  utility  operator.  The  IMAs  will  consist  of  three  individuals \n(general  management  advisor,  operational  and  technical  management  advisor,  and  financial \nmanagement advisor) with experience in managing a large-scale water utility, to act as acting \nmanagers of KUKL, as permitted under the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement and Articles of Association of \nKUKL (2006) for the interim period. The IMAs will take over the responsibility of managing KUKL \nfrom KUKL\u2019s takeover of services, which is expected to begin on 16 January 2008.   \n \n2.  The consultants will be engaged by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), for 18 person-\nmonths each, in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time) using the individual selection method. Considering that only three individuals are \nrequired  for  the  TA,  all  three  must  be  qualified,  with  utility  operation  experience  rather  than \nconsulting  experience.  Because  of  the  need/urgency  to  fast-track  the  engagement,  individual \nconsultant engagement has been found appropriate. \n \nB.  Background \n3.  The rapid and consistent growth of the urban population in Kathmandu Valley has led to a \ncorresponding increase in the demand for infrastructure and social services. This growing demand \nhas only been partially met by the Government of Nepal. As a result, the Valley is faced with a \nchronic shortage of water supply and inadequate access to basic urban sanitation services. This \nsituation  poses  serious  health  risks  for  the  urban  population  as  well  as  wider  environmental \nconcerns. \n \n4.  Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP, Loans 1820-NEP (SF))1 and Kathmandu Valley \nWater Services Sector Development Program (SDP, Loan 2058/59-NEP(SF))2 were prepared to \nimprove the health and well-being of the urban population by diverting water from the Melamchi \nRiver to Kathmandu Valley and improving the supply of potable water. From the outset, the projects \nacknowledged that the chronic water shortages in the Valley were caused not just by a lack of \ninfrastructure and bulk water sources, but also by the weak performance of the existing water utility, \nthe Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC).  \n \n5.  In response, the Government initiated a process of wide-ranging institutional reforms, which \nincluded  the  separation  of  asset  ownership  and  management  of  water  utility  operations;  the \nestablishment of a regulatory commission for water tariffs; and the establishment of KUKL, an \nindependent  water  services  operator.  In  effect,  these  three  entities3  take  over  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities that used to be vested in the NWSC.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for Kathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Program. Manila. \n3  Namely, (i) a public entity called the Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Board (KVWSMB), which holds \nassets, determines policies, awards and monitors licences and contracts for water supply and wastewater services in \nKathmandu Valley; (ii) an autonomous limited liability company called the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited \n(KUKL), established under the Company Act with a majority of public shareholders, to take the responsibility for water \nservices  operations in Kathmandu Valley; and (iii) the Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission (WSTFC), an \nindependent regulatory body for the sector. ", "10  Appendix 3   \n6.  By law, KUKL as a limited liability company is responsible for operating the assets under \nlease from the Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Board (KVWSMB); however, its \ncapacity to do so is limited due to the absence of a professional management team. Further, KUKL \nis expected take over operational services by 16 January, 2008. \n \n7.  To assist KUKL, Loan 2059 foresees a 4-year capacity-building scheme to address two \ndistinct but linked issues: (i) setting up KUKL as a utility that operates on private sector principles, \nand (ii) assisting with the management of the utility.  \n  \n8.  Support will be provided by a capacity-building and public-private partnership team (CBP \nteam) comprising a general manager, an operational and technical manager, a finance manager, \nand other advisors to be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nusing the quality- and cost-based method. To cover line management requirements, KUKL will \nengage deputy managers through a competitive recruitment process.  \n \n9.  The recruitment of the CBP team is expected to take 18 months, which would conflict with \nthe starting date of KUKL\u2019s operational takeover. For this reason, the IMAs will be engaged for an \n18-month period (the interim period), starting 16 January 2008. \n \n10.  The scope of work for the IMAs is outlined below.  \n \nC.  Scope of Work \n11.  As indicated above, the assignment for the interim period comprises three key assignments: \n \n(i)  providing start-up support for KUKL (organizational structure, business processes, \nfinancial management and administration);    \n(ii)  managing ongoing operations (jncluding prudent use of pilot investment funds); and \n(iii)  developing  and  implementing  a  capacity  development  strategy  that  addresses \nownership, knowledge transfer modalities, and exit or handover plan and indicators. \n \n12.   As  a  newly  created  commercial  entity,  KUKL  requires  assistance  to  develop  its \norganizational structure and plot its future strategic direction. The main objective for the IMAs is to \nassure  that  KUKL  has  the  necessary  management  and  business  systems  and  capacity  to \neffectively  assume  its  growing  responsibilities  as  a  limited  liability  company  and  water  utility \noperator. \n \n13.  The  scope  of  the  work  will  include  (i)  preparing  initial  business  policy  statements;  (ii) \ndeveloping operation, information, and reporting procedures and structures; (iii) developing job \ndescriptions; (iv) proposing levels of delegation of authority; and (v) developing an outline and \naction program for completing a business plan.  \n \n14.  The start-up support includes, but is not limited to, the processes in Table A3. \n ", "                      Appendix 3  11 \nTable A3: Processes of Start-up Support \n \n  Organizational Structure  Business Processes  Administrative Processes \n       \nA.

Management support to ongoing operations includes, but is not limited to,  \n \n(i)  managing KUKL on a daily basis; \n(ii)  implementing all services that KUKL is required to deliver, in accordance with the \noperating license and asset lease agreement issued by KVWSMB; \n(iii)  procuring  consultancies  and  civil  works  identified  under  the  MWSP  for  (a)  the \ndemonstration  distribution  network  improvement  scheme,  and  (b)  immediate \nrehabilitation and improvement of works; \n(iv)  implementing (a) the demonstration distribution network improvement scheme, and \n(b) immediate rehabilitation and improvement of works identified under the MWSP; \n(v)  implementing the second round of the voluntary retirement scheme and the transfer \nof the operator\u2019s permanent staff from KVWSMB; and \n(vi)  recruiting the CBP team, including preparing requests for proposals and related \ncontact documents (subject to ADB approval). \n \n16.  As a minimum, the capacity development strategy must incorporate the following: \n \n(i)  measures  to  ensure  ownership  on  behalf  of  the  Nepali  KUKL  staff  and  the \nGovernment stakeholders; \n(ii)  modalities for capacity development support at the level of  the three new entities \n(the capacity to make  the reformed utility management structure functional and \noperational in a sustainable manner) and at  the level of KUKL itself (focus on \nimprovements in internal management and service delivery; and  \n(iii)  a clearly defined knowledge transfer and exit strategy/hand-over plan. The capacity \ndevelopment package will need to be designed and programmed on the basis of (a) \na known start position (viz., baseline institutional and organizational assessment), \n(b) performance benchmarks that allow for meaningful monitoring, and (c) delivery \nmodalities that correspond to identified needs. As for the exit strategy, the IMAs will ", "12  Appendix 3   \nalso prepare a hand-over plan outlining the operational responsibilities, key issues \nencountered,  updated  financial  status  of  KUKL,  and  progress  on  project \nimplementation related to KUKL. \n \n17.
