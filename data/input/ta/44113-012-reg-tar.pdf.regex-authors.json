INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Coral Triangle\u2019s marine and coastal resources are at risk from continued threats \nfrom climate change-induced processes, such as wave actions and storm surges, as well as \nfrom human activities, including reef dynamiting and cyanide poisoning for higher fish yields, \nsand mining for construction, reef breaking for coral harvesting, and pollution from land-based \nsources.  Consequently,  the  Coral  Triangle  Initiative  on  Coral  Reefs,  Fisheries,  and  Food \nSecurity (CTI) 1 was launched in 2007 as a six-country regional cooperation program to protect \nthe  Coral  Triangle\u2019s  economic  and  environmental  assets.  Since  its  launch,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has been fully involved in efforts to provide technical and financial \nsupport to the CTI, with an assistance package valued at $294.4 million, consisting of $97.6 \nmillion (33.2%) in grants and $196.8 million (66.8%) in loans. \n \n2.  These threats are key to the protection and conservation of the Coral Triangle and will \nbe addressed by the proposed technical assistance (TA)2 by supporting the implementation of \nthe national plans of action of the CTI.3  The TA, with cofinancing from the Global Environment \nFacility, aims to enhance coastal and marine resources management by providing technical and \noperational support for institutional strengthening; application of the ecosystems approach to \nfishery management; development of alternative livelihoods for poor coastal communities; and \ncoordination of stakeholders in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines (which are also known \nas Coral Triangle Southeast Asia or CT3). The governments of the CT3 were consulted and \nagreed with the TA impact, output, outcomes, implementation arrangements, cost and financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for consultants. This TA is one of three regional TA \nprojects comprising ADB\u2019s core support to the CTI.4 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1 and a detailed description of the project activities is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Covering  nearly  5.7  million  square  kilometers  of  ocean  around  six  countries  (i.e., \nIndonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste, \nknown as the CT6), the Coral Triangle is often referred to as the \u201cAmazon of the Seas.\u201d It \ncontains 76% of all known coral species and 53% of the world\u2019s coral reefs; about 3,000 species \nof reef fish, including 40% of all known coral reef fish species; and the greatest extent of \nmangroves in the world. It also serves as the spawning and juvenile growth areas for the world\u2019s \nlargest and most valuable tuna fishery and provides income and food security to more than 120 \nmillion  people,  particularly  the  area\u2019s  coastal  communities.  Its  fishery  exports  and  coastal \ntourism revenues are reported to provide a combined annual foreign exchange income of about \n$6.0 billion. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The overarching commitments to action of the CTI are (i) designating and managing priority seascapes, (ii) \napplying the ecosystem approach to the management of fisheries and other marine resources, (iii) establishing and \nmanaging  marine  protected  areas,  (iv)  achieving  climate  change  adaptation  measures,  and  (v)  improving \nthreatened species statuses. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 November 2010. \n3  The national  plans of action focus on seascape management, ecosystem approach to fishery and marine \nresources management, effective marine protected area management, coastal and marine resources management \nfor climate change adaptation, and endangered species management. \n4  The other two TA projects are (i) ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the Coral Triangle for Regional Cooperation \non Knowledge Management, Policy, and Institutional Support to the CTI. Manila (TA 7307-REG); and (ii) ADB. \n2010. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Coastal and Marine Resources Management in the Coral Triangle of \nthe Pacific. Manila (TA 7753-REG). \n ", "2   \n4.  Many fisher families in the CT3 live in subsistence conditions, their livelihoods becoming \nfurther hampered by the destruction of coral reefs and collapse of marine resources. Problems \nof credit repayment, increasing debt, and low prices from middlepeople and/or traders have \noften led these fishers to destructive, illegal fishing methods (e.g., dynamiting) in an attempt to \nincrease their catches. About 90% of the fish in the CT3 is caught by fishers dependent on coral \nreefs for a living, and reef degradation, which has resulted in a drop in fish production, is \nseverely  affecting  the  incomes  and  living conditions  of coastal communities.  For  example, \nincome losses from 21,000 square kilometers of coral reef areas in the Philippines alone had \nbeen estimated at $1.2 billion over 20 years.5 \n \n5.  In addition to poverty and resource degradation issues, the CT3 coastal and marine \nresources sectors suffer from policy, legal, and institutional constraints. While environmental \nand resource management policies and legislation are in place, they are not implemented to the \nfullest extent due to the lack of budgetary allocations and interagency rivalries. Moreover, while \nthe CT3 have decentralized systems of coastal and marine resources management, the lack of \ninstitutional capacity and preparedness of many local governments for the required tasks has \nhampered  ongoing  and  planned  initiatives  and  exacerbated  the  problems  of  resource \ndegradation and poverty prevalence.  \n \n6.  At the subnational levels, capacity development is needed by the relevant government \nagencies to equip them for their responsibilities in coastal and marine resources management, \nparticularly  local  resources  planning,  formulation  of  integrated  coastal  zone  management \npolicies  and  implementing  guidelines  within  the  framework  of  national  policies,  and \ncomanagement with local communities. At the national level, support must be continued for \nsector planning and policy formulation, intersector coordination and networking, as well as \nknowledge  management  to  support  resources  management  decisions.  Finally,  there  is  an \nurgent need to raise income levels and living standards among the coastal communities so that \nthey can exercise effective stewardship over coastal resources, particularly coral reefs and \nassociated ecosystems. For these communities, alternative livelihood activities must also be \ndeveloped, with a focus on investment opportunities, to improve their income-earning potential.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  proposed  TA  will  result  in  the  increased  resilience  of  coastal  and  marine \necosystems and human communities in the CT3. The outcome will be improved management of \ncoastal  and  marine  resources  established  in  the  Sulu\u2013Sulawesi  Marine  Ecoregion  Priority \nSeascape within the Coral Triangle.6 The TA will support the introduction of more effective \nmanagement of coastal and marine resources, especially those associated with coral reef \necosystems, to build their resilience in a period of increased threats arising from climate change \nand  human-induced  impacts,  thereby  maintaining  ecosystem  integrity  and  productivity  and \nensuring the improved socioeconomic status of coastal communities. \n \n                                                 \n5  H. Cesar, L. Burke. and L. Pet-Soede. 2003. The Economics of Worldwide Coral Reef Degradation.

The ecoregion was also declared a priority seascape \nfor CTI implementation during the 4th CTI Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting held in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia in \nOctober 2009. \n ", "  3\n8.  The  TA7 complements  ongoing  and  planned  efforts  in  the  Coral  Triangle  of  ADB\u2019s \nSoutheast  Asia  Department,8 as  well  as  its  development  partners,  such  as  the  Global \nEnvironment  Facility,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,9 and  Australian \nAgency for International Development, which all aim to support the CT6 in the conservation and \nmanagement of coral reefs and associated habitats for food security and poverty reduction. The \nTA also supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which recognizes the urgent need to promote locally \nand globally environmentally sustainable economic growth, invest in sound environmental and \nnatural  resources  management,  and  further  strengthen  regional  initiatives  for  adapting  to \nclimate  change.10 It  is  likewise  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration \nStrategy, the fourth pillar of which is cooperation in regional public goods.11 The TA supports the \ncountry partnership strategy of the respective CT3 countries. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The  TA  impact  and  outcome  will  be  attained  through  three  outputs:  (i)  policy  and \ninstitutional frameworks for sustainable coastal and marine ecosystem management improved, \n(ii) ecosystem-based approach to coastal and marine resources management pilot tested, and \n(iii) effective project management established by ADB and the CT3 governments. \n \n10.  Output 1: Policy and institutional frameworks for sustainable coastal and marine \nresources management improved. The TA will support the CT3 governments in establishing \nan enabling environment for sustainable coastal and marine resources management through (i) \nimproving  policy  and  legal  frameworks,  and  monitoring  their  enforcement;  (ii)  building \ninstitutional capacity of national, subnational, and local government agencies in planning and \nimplementation of resources management plans, programs, and projects in marine conservation \nareas, reserves, and production seascapes; (iii) strengthening staff capability to understand the \nimpacts  of  climate  change,  need  for  climate  change  adaptation,  and  identification  and \nimplementation of technically appropriate and effective adaptation measures; (iv) promoting \nsustainable  financing  of  resources  management  and  adaptation  measures;  (v)  mentoring \ngovernment staff in the application of decision support tools in knowledge management and the \nproduction of tangible knowledge products (e.g., technical reports, guidelines, manuals, policy \nbriefs,  news  articles,  and  other  public  awareness  materials);  and  (vi)  conducting  public \nawareness campaigns to improve stakeholders\u2019 appreciation of the need for coastal and marine \nresources management as a tool for improving the resilience of ecosystems and communities to \nclimate change and other threats. \n \n                                                 \n7  This TA is one of three regional TA projects comprising ADB\u2019s core support to the CTI that are geared to assist the \nCT6 in developing strategies and activities to implement their respective national plans of action for the CTI and \nfacilitate  cooperation  on  regional  issues.  The  Technical  Assistance  for  Strengthening  Coastal  and  Marine \nResources Management in the Coral Triangle of the Pacific (TA 7753-REG) will support actions to help ensure \nfood security for the population in Pacific CTI countries (Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste), \nFiji Islands, and Vanuatu, resulting from the increased resilience of coastal and marine ecosystems. The Technical \nAssistance to the Coral Triangle for Regional Cooperation on Knowledge Management, Policy, and Institutional \nSupport to the CTI (TA 7307-REG) will link the Southeast Asian and Pacific CTI activities of ADB and facilitate CTI-\nwide information exchange and learning\u2014including program management and coordination support. \n8  ADB. 2008.

Output  2:  Ecosystem-based  approach  to  coastal  and  marine  resources \nmanagement pilot-tested. This output directly addresses illegal, unreported, and unregulated \nfishing; overfishing; destruction of natural habitats; and other constraints to sustainable fishery \nmanagement and economic development in coastal communities. A holistic, comprehensive, \nand integrated ecosystem-based approach to coastal and marine resources management will \nbe demonstrated at the national and regional levels through the (i) effective management of \nmarine  protected  areas;  (ii)  pilot  implementation  of  a  fishery  monitoring,  control,  and \nsurveillance system in the Sulu\u2013Sulawesi Marine Ecoregion Priority Seascape; (iii) pilot testing \nof ridge-to-reef management of a coastal zone with large-scale agricultural plantations and \nmarine industries; and (iv) development and pilot testing of sustainable livelihood activities as a \nmeans of reducing fishing pressure on resources and improving the socioeconomic conditions \nof coastal communities in Sabah, Malaysia. Opportunities for public\u2013private partnerships in the \ndevelopment  of  business  and  management  plans  for  marine  protected  areas,  sustainable \nfinancing  schemes,  and  climate  change  adaptation  interventions  and/or  measures  will  be \nidentified and pursued, and women will be encouraged and supported in livelihood and/or \nenterprise development in the ecoregion. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Effective  project  management  established  by  ADB  and  the  CT3 \ngovernments. A project management system will be set up, consisting of (i) a TA coordination \nunit within ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division \n(SEER); (ii) a regional project management office; and (iii) national project coordination offices \n(NPCOs)  in  each  CT3.  A  project  performance  management  system  will  be  designed  and \ninstalled in the ADB TA coordination unit and NPCOs, which will include agreed performance \nindicators, targets, and data and/or information sources as defined in the design and monitoring \nframework. An international project coordinator and monitoring and evaluation specialist and a \nproject management consultant will be engaged by ADB to support the countries in project \nplanning and implementation, and to liaise with ADB and the CTI secretariat. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $15.2 million equivalent, of which (i) $11.2 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Global Environment Facility and administered by ADB, and (ii) \n$1.0 million will financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013\nother sources). The governments of the CT3 will each contribute $1.0 million equivalent through \nin-kind support and related costs, for a total of $3.0 million equivalent. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  Executing and implementing agencies. ADB, through SEER, will be the executing \nagency, while the implementing agencies will be CTI focal agencies in the CT3: (i) Ministry of \nMarine Affairs and Fisheries, Indonesia; (ii) National Oceanography Directorate of the Ministry \nof Science, Technology and Innovation, Malaysia; and (iii) Department of Environment and \nNatural Resources, Philippines. The TA will be implemented over a 4-year period with a target \ncommencement date of 1 July 2011 and an end date of 30 June 2015. \n \n15.  Project management. A TA coordination unit will be set up within SEER under an \ninternational project coordinator, to be recruited directly by ADB, who will oversee day-to-day TA \nimplementation on behalf of ADB. The TA coordination unit will liaise with other relevant ADB \nunits  and/or  offices,  particularly  the  Pacific  Department  and  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \n ", "  5\nDevelopment Department. At the national level, an NPCO will be set up in each implementing \nagency to oversee and coordinate the implementation of TA activities in the field. The NPCOs \nwill  be  responsible  for  (i)  preparing  work  plans;  (ii)  setting  up  a  project  performance \nmanagement system for monitoring the work program under the project outputs, linking the \nnational  coordination  committees  to  the  CTI  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  at  the  CTI \nsecretariat, and preparing local progress and monitoring reports; and (iii) coordinating in-country \nactivities, and liaising with the national coordination committees and the Global Environment \nFacility focal points. A detailed description of the TA implementation arrangements, including \nthe project organization structure and funds flow, is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n16.  Consulting services. The TA will require 64 person-months of international and 640 \nperson-months of national consulting services. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3, \nand  further  details  are  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  ADB  will  engage  the \ninternational project coordinator and monitoring and evaluation specialist on an individual basis \nto serve for 24 person-months. A project management consultant (i.e., firm) will be recruited to \nsupply 34 person-months of international and 630 person-months of national consulting services \nto support in-country project management and implementation. The firm will also be responsible \nfor the management and administration of various training programs, workshops, conferences, \nand  surveys,  including  subcontracting  of  various  service  providers  such  as  academic  and \ntraining institutions, local nongovernment organizations, and community-based organizations. \n \n17.  In addition, the firm will establish a regional project management office that will be \nresponsible for overall TA management at the regional level and for coordination between the \nNPCOs and the CTI secretariat, as well as between the NPCOs and the TA coordination unit. \nThe office will establish links with other projects implemented in the Sulu\u2013Sulawesi Marine \nEcoregion Priority Seascape and under the CTI program framework of the Global Environment \nFacility.  It  will  also  prepare  regular  progress  reports  for  submission  to  the  CTI  national \ncoordination committees and senior officials' meetings. It will be supervised by an international \nteam leader and project management specialist, assisted by three deputy team leaders and \ninstitutional  development  specialists  (one  for  each  country),  who  will  head  the  respective \nNPCOs and be responsible for project management at the national level. Another international \nfirm will be engaged by ADB to prepare a study on scaling up investment program for coastal \nresources management in Indonesia. Six person-months of international consultants and 10 \nperson-months of national consultants are required for this study. \n \n18.  Firms will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection method (90:10) following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nDisbursements will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $11,218,180  for  Coastal  and  Marine \nResources Management in the Coral Triangle\u2014Southeast Asia, to be financed on a grant basis \nby the Global Environment Facility. If the Board approves ADB administering the technical \nassistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, will approve ADB \nproviding the balance of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on \na grant basis for the Coastal and Marine Resources Management in the Coral Triangle\u2014\nSoutheast Asia. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nIncreased resilience of  By 2020 from 2010  CTI secretariat meeting  CT3 governments \ncoastal and marine  baseline:a  reports and publications,  maintain a strong sense \necosystems and    including The State of  of commitment and \nhuman communities in  10% increase in the  the Coral Triangle  ownership throughout \nthe CT3  area of mangrove  Report  the 10-year \nforests, sea grass beds,    implementation of the \nand live coral cover in  RPMO, NPCOs, and  CTI regional plan of \nthe SSME  NCC reports  action. \n     \n10% increase in the  Reports of fish and reef  CTI development \nbiomass of coral reef  monitoring  partners and partner \nfish (e.g., groupers and  surveys/studies by the  institutions sustain and \nwrasses) in MPAs in  CT3  increase support to the \nthe SSME    implementation of the \n  GEF tracking tools  CTI regional plan of \nImproved food securityb  action. \nof coastal communities   \nin the SSME  Risk \nClimate change \nimpacts on marine \necosystems and \ncoastal communities \nare severe and difficult \nto mitigate. \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved  By 2015:  NCC reports to the CTI  CT3 governments \nmanagement of    secretariat, SSME  continue to be \ncoastal and marine  10%\u201320% of coral  subcommittees on  supportive of regional \nresources established  reefs, sea grass beds,  MPAs and networks,  environmental \nin the SSME Priority  and mangrove forests  and on sustainable  initiatives, including the \nSeascape within the  with management  fisheries  SSME Ecoregion \nCoral Triangle  designation    Conservation Plan, CTI, \n  State of the coast  and international \n3 MPAs within the  reports for Indonesia,  commitments under the \nSSME have  Malaysia, and the  Convention on \nmanagement  Philippines  Biological Diversity. \neffectiveness scoresc     \nimproved by 5%d  Project monitoring  Risk \n  reports  Delayed releases of \nEcosystem-based    counterpart funding \nmanagement  GEF biodiversity  from the participating \nframeworks established  tracking tools  governments delay \nin 5 production  project implementation. \nseascapes and climate \nchange adaptation \nframeworks \ndemonstrated in at \nleast 3 sites \n \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms Risks \nOutputs       \n1.

Six person-\nmonths of international consultants and 10 person-months of national consultants are required \nfor this study. The international consultancy firms will be recruited through quality- and cost-\nbased selection method (90:10).1 These consultants will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference \nare given below, and the organization of the consulting services and detailed terms of reference \nare in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nB.  Project Coordinator and Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist (Individual) \n(international, 24 person-months) \n \n2.  An international project coordinator will be engaged directly by ADB to manage the \noperations of the TA coordination unit at ADB, design and establish the project performance \nmanagement  system,  and  monitor  the  activities  of  the  participating  countries  during  TA \nimplementation. The coordinator will (i) liaise closely with the project management consultant to \nensure that work planning, financial management, and project reporting are consistently applied \nusing an agreed format and agreed timelines; (ii) review work plans and budgets; (iii) review \nprocurement documentation; and (iv) report on project progress to ADB. \n \nC.  Project  Management  Consultant  (international,  34  person-months;  national,  630 \nperson-months) \n \n3.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  to  serve  as  the  project \nmanagement  consultant  with  responsibility  for  the  provision  of  day-to-day  technical  and \nadministrative support to the national project coordination offices in the participating countries \nduring  project  implementation,  including  (i)  detailed  work  planning,  (ii)  coordinating  the \nimplementation of demonstration or pilot projects, (iii) procurement of goods and services, (iv) \nfinancial management, and (v) documentation and reporting. The consulting firm will provide the \nservices of the following consultants: (i) an international team leader and project management \nspecialist; (ii) three deputy team leaders to coordinate project inputs and ensure consolidation of \ncountry reports and documents (including country work plans, progress and financial reports, \nand statements of expenses) and reporting these to the project coordinator; (iii) coastal and \nmarine  resources  management  policy  specialist  and  knowledge  management  specialist  to \nsupport the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries, and Food Security secretariat; \nand  (iv)  short-term  technical  specialists,  both  international  and  national,  who  will  provide \nspecialized inputs in the conduct of studies and various technical analyses, depending on the \nspecific requirements of the countries (Table A3). \n                                                 \n1  Given the need to ensure that a firm with the technical skills and project management experience is recruited by \nADB, a heavier weight will be given to the technical merits of the proposals. Hence, the project management \nconsultant will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection method (90:10). \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nTable A3: Breakdown of Project Management Consulting Services  \n(number of person-months) \n \nPosition  International  National  Total \nA.
