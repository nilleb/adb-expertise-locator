INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  accelerate  the  sound \ndevelopment of the railway subsector in Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \ncountries1 through railway transport market research, project identification and preparation, \nknowledge sharing, and capacity development. \n \n2.  The  TA  aligns  with  Strategy  2030  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB);  ADB\u2019s \nOperational  Plan  for  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration,  2016\u20132020;  the  CAREC  2030 \nstrategy; the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020; and the CAREC railway \nstrategy, 2017\u20132030.2 It also complements other regional cooperation programs, such as the Belt \nand Road Initiative of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the Transport Corridor Europe\u2013\nCaucasus\u2013Asia program supported by the European Union, the Trans-Asian Railway supported \nby the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and the Lapis \nLazuli Corridor agreement.3 The TA supports regional and interregional trade and cooperation \nand promotes ADB as a prime development partner in the railway subsector in Central and West \nAsia, aiming for strong, long-term engagement with CAREC member countries.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Transport remains the primary vehicle for regional cooperation and integration in CAREC \ncountries. Aiming to transform CAREC countries from landlocked to land-linked, the CAREC \nProgram supports the expansion of trade and the improvement of economic development by more \nclosely connecting the CAREC region with its larger and rapidly growing neighbors. Central Asia \nhas great potential to benefit from growing Eurasian transit traffic and the intraregional trade. The \ndevelopment of an effective, efficient, sustainable, safe, and user-friendly multimodal corridor \nnetwork is the primary means of achieving this goal. Transport has therefore remained the largest \nsector of activity in the 17-year history of the CAREC Program, accounting for more than 80% of \ninvestments totaling $25 billion. \n \n4.  CAREC countries are increasing their emphasis on railways for regional connectivity. \nTransport activities are guided by the Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020 approved \nby CAREC countries in 2013, which recognized the need for balanced development of different \nmodes. Particular emphasis was placed on developing railway transport, given its dominant role \nin external trade and transit. In many CAREC countries, railways receive more attention and \nincreased financial support since improved railway connectivity facilitates trade and can have a \ncompetitive advantage in terms of transport time and cost over other modes of transport. \n \n5.  Subsequently, CAREC countries formulated the CAREC railway strategy, 2017\u20132030 to \nserve as a guiding document for the sound, long-term development of CAREC railways. The \n                                                \n1  Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, the People's Republic of \nChina (Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region), Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and \nUzbekistan. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n3  Signed in November 2017 between Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and Turkmenistan. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 October 2018. \n ", "2 \nstrategy was formulated by the Railway Working Group (RWG),5 which consists of representatives \nof railway agencies from CAREC countries, and was endorsed at the 15th CAREC Ministerial \nConference on 26 October 2016. The strategy is intended to equip the region\u2019s railways to better \ncapture evolving trade flows and contribute to regional development. It formulates a number of \npriorities for the following three primary efforts: develop effective rail infrastructure, develop robust \ncommercial capabilities, and improve legal and regulatory frameworks.6 Designated rail corridors \nhave been conceived by the RWG to (i) develop the national rail systems and (ii) benefit from \nregional transport connections.7 \n \n6.  Despite  their  importance,  railways  in  the  CAREC  region  often  struggle  to  remain \ncompetitive.  Since  rail  networks  have  a  long  life,  existing  network  configurations  do  not \nnecessarily match new traffic patterns; many railways in the region struggle to adapt to these \nchanging  conditions.  Besides  gaps  in  effective  railway  infrastructure,  the  lack  of  robust \ncommercial capabilities and inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks have caused railway \nmarket shares to decline, and most railways are not fully able to capture available trade flows. An \nincreasing amount of freight traffic is carried by roads rather than rail, costing CAREC economies \nmore in the form of traffic congestion, road crashes, and road asset deterioration. As a result, \ninterregional and intraregional trade is subjected to high transportation costs and bottlenecks. \n \n7.  Further  development  of  railways  requires  ways  to  prioritize  investments,  structure \nfinancing, and improve institutions. A regional railway system that has been improved through \ninfrastructure investments and policy measures will enhance access to regional and international \nmarkets and help increase economic growth and social welfare. \n \n8.  New investments are needed to maintain and improve the competitiveness of railways, \nbut it is difficult to attract commercial financing because railways are bulky, long term, and risky \nin nature. There is the continued need to seek financing and funding from the government and \ninternational financial institutions, with further consideration on how such public funds can attract \nprivate financing. Furthermore, CAREC countries lack an adequate regional traffic model that is \nneeded to identify the most promising rail transport routes and to prioritize investments in rail \ninfrastructure. \n \n9.  The institutional and commercial changes needed to improve the financial sustainability \nof railway organizations are difficult to implement and are time-consuming, requiring systematic \ninjection of knowledge and continued capacity building support. CAREC railways need to engage \nin a process of commercialization and reform to become efficient, customer-oriented transport \noperators, making investments economically viable. While the approach and pace of reform will \ndiffer among CAREC railway organizations, there is valuable knowledge to share in common \nareas,  such  as  financial  restructuring,  corporatization,  marketing,  asset  management, \ninteroperability, and railway safety. \n \n10.  At the 17th Meeting of the CAREC Transport Sector Coordinating Committee held on 18\u2013\n20 April 2018 in Istanbul, Turkey, CAREC member countries expressed particular interest in \nregional TA that would help the RWG address common challenges. \n \n                                                \n5  The RWG was set up by a decision of the 14th Transport Sector Coordinating Committee in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, \nin April 2015. \n6  Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Strategy: Vision, Approach, and Priorities (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 3). \n7  ADB. 2014. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020. Manila. \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: railway transport that is quick, efficient, \naccessible for customers, easy to use throughout the region, and the mode of choice for trade \nachieved.8 The TA will have the following outcome: railway investments in CAREC countries \nprioritized to match market opportunities and backed by sector reforms.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Subregional rail traffic model developed. Under this output, ADB will develop \na regional transport model that will indicate main traffic flows by origin and destination and type \nof cargo. The model will identify the cargo flows most suitable for rail transport, such as bulk goods \nand container transport, as well as crucial intermodal connections and border-crossing points. \nThe analysis of the transport flows will include an assessment of the sustainability of the volumes \nand routes. Where relevant to define viability, passenger transport will be addressed as well. \nBased on this assessment, priority projects for the completion of missing rail links and other critical \ninvestments (such as electrification, rolling stock, and terminals) will be identified and proposed \nfor inclusion in national railway investment plans. The model will help demonstrate to CAREC \ncountries the need for concerted investment planning to reap benefits from regional transport. \nThe model will be made publicly available through the CAREC website. Further, the aim is to link \nthe CAREC transport model with the transport corridor data collected for the Greater Mekong \nSubregion to gradually develop an Asia-wide rail transport database.10  \n \n13.  Output 2: Project preparation facility established. To help CAREC countries formulate \nbankable investment projects, the TA will facilitate swift mobilization of expertise to screen project \noptions, perform pre-feasibility studies or validate existing pre-feasibility or feasibility studies, and \nsupport the prioritization and initial conceptualization of investments. This will also allow ADB and \nother CAREC development partners to scope out their potential support before full-fledged project \npreparation. Future RWG meetings will be used to receive project ideas in line with the CAREC \nrailway strategy that may find sufficient government commitment to be implemented under the \nCAREC Program. The TA team will, in consultation with the RWG, select project suggestions \nbased on project size and complexity, regional impact, interest to include the project in the \ncountries\u2019 lending programs, feasibility to perform a quick assessment, and relative urgency. The \nTA will allow screening of such project ideas on their economic and technical viability at relatively \nshort notice. \n \n14.  Output 3: Knowledge products completed. The TA will develop knowledge products \nand conduct events in common areas of interest in sector reform and commercialization, such as \nstate-owned enterprise restructuring, financial restructuring, asset management, tariff regulation, \nborder-crossing policies, and interoperability. Topics will be prioritized based on consultations to \nbe done at the first RWG meeting under this TA. Development partners will be invited to join and \ncontribute to related activities, strengthening coordination and dialogue in the region. \n \n15.  Output 4: Capacity of executing agencies in project preparation improved. The TA \nwill facilitate activities to strengthen the capacity of railway agencies in key areas required for the \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2016.

Furthermore, the awareness and capacity of \nrailway agencies will be strengthened in the application of less traditional financial instruments \nsuch  as  sector  loans  and  policy-based  loans.  Based  on  staffing,  procedures,  and  policy \ndiagnostics of the railway agencies in the participating developing member countries, an agency-\nspecific set of actions and measures will be identified and supported under the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, of which (i) $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund \n(PRCF)11 and (ii) $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the United Kingdom Fund for \nAsia Regional Trade and Connectivity (ARTCF) under the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFinancing Partnership Facility, both to be administered by ADB. The PRCF will predominantly \nfinance consulting services, while ARTCF funds will particularly be used for costs related to events \nand publications.12 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, with the Transport and Communications \nDivision of the Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) responsible for managing the TA. \nStaff of the East Asia Department will be consulted for coordination with its developing member \ncountries.  TA  activities  will  also  be  aligned  with  activities  of  the  Transport  Sector  Group \ncoordinated by ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department. This will help \nto promote interregional cooperation, where the TA\u2019s activities can be linked to initiatives of the \nGreater Mekong Subregion and the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program. The \nTransport Sector Group will be kept informed on the progress and outputs achieved under this \nTA to ensure complementarity. \n \n18.  The primary vehicle for TA implementation will be the RWG. Representatives of each \nCAREC country and development partner to the RWG will be invited to provide inputs and \nfeedback on TA activities and outputs. RWG meetings will be held at least once a year to agree \non key actions and monitor progress against them. Key decisions by the RWG will be put forward \nto the CAREC Transport Sector Coordinating Committee, as the sector governing body under the \nCAREC Program, for endorsement and further guidance. The TA will financially support the \nconduct of RWG, Transport Sector Coordinating Committee and other associated events in \nsupport of the TA outputs and outcome. The Transport and Communications Division of the \nCWRD being part of the CAREC Secretariat will also be responsible for the organization  of \nmeetings and events in cooperation with the Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision of the CWRD. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented in coordination with development partners including but not \nlimited to the CAREC Institute, the International Union of Railways, the Organisation for Co-\n                                                \n11 The PRCF was originally named the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund \nin the 2005 Board paper. \n12 The PRCF will finance expenses related to the TA and other eligible initiatives agreed by the PRC and ADB, including \nconsulting services, training, conferences, and workshops. The PRCF may also finance small-scale civil works and \nother related expenses. The ARTCF will finance TA expenses in the form of consulting services, training events, \nconferences and workshops, and related activities. The grant can be used to support staff resources related to \nARTCF management in the form of sponsored staff and staff consultants as necessary. \n ", "5 \noperation between Railways, and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia \nand the Pacific. \n \n20.
