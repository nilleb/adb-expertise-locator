In response to requests from the Governments of Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the ADB is \nproviding assistance to mitigate flooding and bank erosion on the Pyanj River. The Pyanj River \nis the source and primary tributary of the Amu Darya River. With the Pamir River, the Pyanj \nforms the international border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The Pyanj\u2019s catchment area \ncomprises 107,000 square kilometers (km2) of mountainous terrain that extends into a lowland \nflood plain of 6,500 km2. The Pyanj travels about 1,000 kilometers (km) before becoming the \nAmu Darya after the confluence of the Vache and Pamir rivers. More than 2,400 km long, with a \nbasin of more than 530,000 km2, the Amu Darya is the largest river in Central Asia. The Amu \nDarya has annual flows of about 75 billion cubic meters, of which 13\u201318 billion cubic meters \noriginates from Afghanistan, with the vast majority of the rest coming from Tajikistan.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Flood Risks. The Pyanj River poses significant flood and erosion risks to Afghanistan \nand Tajikistan. Although the risks differ for the two countries, they are an issue of significant \nmutual concern. The Afghan side of the border has many low-lying, densely populated islands in \nthe delta as the river reaches the flood plain from the mountains. The soil is soft and very \nproductive in the delta and along the Afghan bank, but few formal flood protection works have \nbeen  undertaken  in  Afghanistan.  Banks  erode  regularly,  especially  during  the  spring  and \nsummer flood season, washing away settlements, traditional irrigation systems, and irrigated \nagricultural land. On the Tajik side, intensive irrigated agriculture was developed under the \nSoviet Union, and an extensive system of flood embankments was put in place to protect the \nirrigation systems. In the post-Soviet era, these defenses have deteriorated and erode during \nthe flood season. When the embankments are breached, the flooding damages the irrigated \nagriculture and settlements that have developed behind their protection. \n \n3.  Constraints to Effective Flood Management. Effective flood management and the \nlonger-term Pyanj River Basin development and management are constrained by (i) incomplete \nknowledge and understanding of the hydrology; (ii) lack of understanding of the Pyanj River \nmorphology; (iii) lack of modes or institutions to effectively coordinate a joint approach to basin \nplanning, development, and management; and (iv) lack of capacity to undertake the requisite \nactivities for basin planning, development, and management. \n \n4.  Hydrometeorological monitoring and data within the basin are inadequate; in the Afghan \nportion of the basin, they have been essentially nonexistent since 1980. The Tajikistan Agency \nfor Hydrometeorology in the Ministry of Agriculture and Nature Projection inherited the Soviet \nhydrometeorology system. However, the facilities have become increasingly dilapidated since \nthe early 1990s. Tajikistan operates four gauging stations on the Pyanj River at Ishkashim, \nShidz, Khirmanjo, and Nizhni Pyanj. However, river flow cannot be measured because the \nrequired cableways to the Afghan side are not functional due to lack of maintenance and \nsecurity issues. Additional weather stations to assess snow pack and precipitation are needed. \nThis information, essential for predicting flow, will become increasingly important with climate \nchange. In addition to equipment, Afghanistan and Tajikistan must share information, which \nrequires common protocols for data collection and analysis. Staff at the Ministry of Energy and \nWater (MEW) in Afghanistan and the Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation \n(MWRLR)  in  Tajikistan  needs  substantial  capacity  development  for  more  effective  water \nmanagement of the Pyanj. Establishing an extensive and reliable hydrometeorological network \nis critical for all aspects of basin planning, development, and management, including flood \ncontrol, irrigation, hydropower, water supply, and environment. \n                                                 \n1 The technical assistance project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 9 January 2008. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  The Pyanj River morphology is very dynamic, significantly increasing the difficulty of \npredicting floods, and designing and placing flood management infrastructure. This also has had \nimplications for the location of the international border. Afghanistan has had numerous border \ntreaties with its northern neighbors. The last one, signed with the Soviet Union in 1983, was \nbased on the main river channel at that time. Since then, however, the main river channel has \nmigrated north, well within Tajikistan, and runs nearly adjacent to the first 12 km of flood \nembankments downstream from the main irrigation intake on the Tajik side of the flood area.  In \npractice, Afghanistan is accustomed to occupying all of the territory to the south of this channel, \nmeaning Afghans are on the Tajik side of the border. While the two countries have talked \namicably to address this issue, significant further dialogue is needed to reach an agreement on \nborder concerns. Extensive cooperation and data sharing are also required for both counties to \ndevelop and implement effective flood management. \n \n6.  Development Concerns.  In addition to the immediate concern over flood management, \nsignificant  development  opportunities  exist  in  the  Pyanj  River  Basin.  An  estimated  19,000 \nmegawatts of hydropower potential could be exploited, although only a small fraction has been \ndeveloped. The Amu Darya supports 4 million hectares of irrigated agriculture, but additional \nland could be cultivated. Afghanistan, which has very limited development exploiting the Pyanj \nRiver  waters,  has  plans  to  expand  irrigated  area  and  develop  hydropower  in  the  basin. \nTajikistan also has development plans, primarily hydropower, for the basin. While many of these \nopportunities  will  be  exploited  in due  time,  their  successful  development  will require  more \nknowledge  and  cooperation  between  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan,  as  well  as  with  their \ndownstream neighbors in accordance with international best practice and law.2 \n \n7.  Existing Cooperation.  Afghanistan and Tajikistan have engaged in amicable dialogue \nand have demonstrated a willingness to work together, as expressed through the following: (i) \ncooperation agreement on the reclamation of hydropower resources of the Pyanj River (April \n2005), (ii) memorandum of understanding between MEW and MWRLR (September 2006), (iii) \nagreement between the governments on mutual cooperation on transboundary river use and \nprotection  (2007),  (iv)  minutes  of  the  joint  meeting  of  delegations  from  Tajikistan  and \nAfghanistan  concerning  bank  strengthening  works  on  the  Pyanj  River  (March  2007),  (v) \nstrengthening transboundary cooperation in water resources management between Afghanistan \nand Tajikistan in the Upper Amu Darya River Basin (Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization \u2013 \nEnvironment and Security Initiative) (April 2007), and (vi) a recent mission by Afghan officials to \nDushanbe in August 2007. Despite the dialogue and missions, most of the agreements are \ngeneral  with  few  specific  actions,  and  all  activities  have  been  on  an  ad  hoc  basis.  More \nsubstantive and permanent engagement is needed to address issues of common concern to \nAfghanistan and Tajikistan in the Pyanj River Basin. \n \n8.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) Assistance.  ADB has recently provided assistance \nto Tajikistan to address flood concerns through changes in scope to an agriculture rehabilitation \nloan and an irrigation rehabilitation loan to rebuild the embankments that were destroyed in the \nfloods in 2005. ADB also recently approved the Khatlon Province Flood Risk Management \nProject3 ($23 million) to finish the rehabilitation of the embankments, which will be implemented \nby MWRLR. Some of these actions have raised Afghan concerns that reinforcing the flood \n                                                 \n2  ADB is preparing a regional technical assistance (RETA) entitled Improved Management of Water Resources in \nCentral  Asia,  which  will  include  Afghanistan,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan. The RETA will foster dialogue and cooperation among the riparian states with the goal of an eventual \nagreement on water sharing. \n3  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Tajikistan for the Khatlon Province Flood Risk Management Project. Manila (Loan 2356-TAJ, for $23 \nmillion, approved on 5 October 2007). \n ", "  3\nprotection works on the Tajik side of the river will exacerbate flood and erosion problems on the \nAfghan side. However, the environmental assessments carried out under ADB projects have not \nsubstantiated  these  concerns.  Still,  the  damage  on  the  Afghan  side  is  substantial  and  of \nparamount concern to the Government of Afghanistan. ADB is responding to these concerns \nthrough a proposed $3 million grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) for the \nCommunity Flood Management and Livelihood Protection Project in Takhar Province, which will \nprovide livelihood development in affected areas and civil works for riverbank protection. In \naddition, the Afghanistan Water Resources Development Project, ADB\u2019s proposed next water \nresources grant to Afghanistan for approximately $200 million in 2009, has a large component \nproposed for extensive flood protection works along the Pyanj and Amu Darya rivers. \n \n9.  The  Way  Forward.  However,  to  address  flood  issues  effectively  and  sustainably \nthroughout the Pyanj River Basin, a more comprehensive and methodical approach is needed. \nThis requires Afghanistan and Tajikistan to work jointly on a plan to (i) improve river flow and \nflood prediction ability; (ii) identify, evaluate, prioritize, and program structural and nonstructural \nflood  management  measures;  and  (iii)  strengthen  flood  warning  and  emergency  response \ncapacity. While flood management is of immediate concern, it is a subset of overall river basin \nplanning, development, and management, which is the appropriate framework in which it should \nbe addressed. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the regional technical assistance (RETA) will be improved water resources \nmanagement in the Pyanj River Basin, and the immediate reduction of negative impacts from \nfloods and bank erosion. The RETA outcome will be improved knowledge, increased capacity, \nand strengthened institutions for planning and managing the Pyanj River Basin with a focus on \nflood management. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The RETA will have the following components: (i) improved knowledge base for basin \nplanning, development, and management; (ii) flood management; (iii) institutional development \nand cooperation; and (iv) capacity building supported through execution of relevant outputs. \n \n12.  Improved Knowledge Base for Basin Planning, Development, and Management. \nThis component will develop a program to compile and manage technical and socioeconomic \ninformation to support immediate efforts to improve flood management. The information and its \nongoing management also will support broader planning and management activities throughout \nthe Amu Darya Basin. The approach to this component will be to coordinate ongoing activities of \nthe governments, development partners, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the \nbasin. It will also directly support initial studies that address critical data gaps, focusing on \nhydrology, the hydrometeorology network, river morphology, and social and economic baseline \ndata. Outputs from this component will include an overall assessment of needs and plan for \nbasin  data  collection  and  management,  management  information  systems,  geographic \ninformation systems management tools, protocols for data sharing, and selected studies. \n \n13.  Flood Management. This component will have three subcomponents: (i) improving river \nflow and flood prediction capacity for the Pyanj; (ii) identifying, screening, and prioritizing a \nprogram of structural and nonstructural, mutually beneficial flood management measures for \nAfghanistan and Tajikistan; and (iii) strengthening the flood warning and emergency response \ncapacity for both countries. This component will build upon the work of the first component. As \nenvisaged, some of the high-priority flood management measures identified will be developed \n ", "4   \nfurther and supported by ADB financing under the proposed Afghanistan Water Resources \nManagement Project in 2009.4 Outputs from this component will include analyses of hydrology \nand morphology, institutional assessments of flood-related agencies, scoping, pre-feasibility and \nfeasibility studies for flood management, flood and hazard mapping, and plans to improve flood \nmanagement and response. The RETA will produce a Pyanj River Basin flood management \nmaster plan that covers Tajikistan and Afghanistan.5 For the first two components, a technical \nsecretariat will be created with MEW and MWRLR staff and other relevant ministries to work \nwith the implementation consultants. \n \n14.  Institutional Development and Cooperation. This component will foster cooperation \non various levels. It will support the establishment and regular meetings of a steering committee \nthat will set the agenda and guide the RETA, as well as serve as a permanent platform for \nAfghanistan and Tajikistan to discuss issues of mutual concern in the Pyanj River Basin. If the \ngovernments want a permanent management organization for Pyanj River Basin, the RETA \nteam will work with the steering committee to develop one. Importantly, the steering committee \nwill provide a forum to coordinate and communicate progress and concerns regarding ADB \nactivities in the area, including (i) the Khatlon Province Flood Risk Management Project, (ii) the \nproposed  JFPR  Community  Flood  Management  and  Livelihood  Protection  Project  in \nAfghanistan, and (iii) the proposed Afghanistan Water Resources Management Project for 2009. \nIn addition to flood management, the steering committee will address other issues of mutual \nconcern,  such  as  reconciliation  of  the  international  boundary.  This  component  will  provide \nneeded technical and/or legal and institutional expertise to support the development of bilateral \nagreements for planning, development, and management in the Pyanj River Basin. Initially, it \nwill focus on the requisite agreements to support the development of the flood master plan. This \ncomponent also will support facilitation of meetings and any required institutional and other \nexpertise to support the work of the steering committee. Further, it will facilitate community \nexchanges of local residents and local government officials to work on the flood master plan, \ncoordinate flood emergency response efforts, and execute other aspects of the RETA. Standing \nor ad hoc committees will be formed as needed while the work progresses. Outputs from this \ncomponent  will  include  agreements,  meeting  minutes,  special  studies,  and  policy \nrecommendations. \n \n15.  Capacity Development.  Capacity development cuts across all aspects of the RETA \nand will be delivered through a variety of methods. The technical secretariat will work closely \nwith the technical specialists recruited through the RETA, who will provide workshops, short \ntraining courses, and resource materials for the relevant agencies and communities in both \ncountries. Outside training and short courses also will be provided to the technical secretariat. \nThe RETA team will coordinate relevant training with ongoing ADB interventions in Afghanistan \nand Tajikistan, such as the Khatlon Province Flood Risk Management Project and the proposed \nAfghanistan Water Resources Management Project. Further, the RETA will support training for \nthe steering committee and fund its members\u2019 participation in conferences and other activities \nrelated to basin planning, management, and development. Outputs from this component will \ninclude resource materials, workshops, short training courses, and reports. \n                                                 \n4 The RETA will carry out required due diligence on the environment, indigenous peoples, and resettlement according \nto ADB\u2019s guidelines. The RETA will not support civil works. The majority of safeguard due diligence will be \nexecuted when feasibility studies and detailed designs are finalized under subsequent investments. \n5 The flood master plan will include screening criteria such as technical, social, economic, and environmental \nconsiderations for proposed interventions. It also will explore financing options for its implementation. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The RETA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.7 million, of which $1.6 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program. The governments will \ncontribute a local currency cost equivalent to $100,000 on a pro rata basis. Detailed cost estimates \nand financing are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA. MEW and MWRLR will be the lead \ncounterpart  agencies.  At  RETA  inception,  ADB  in  consultation  with  the  governments  will \nestablish the steering committee comprising ministerial-level officials from MEW, MWRLR, and \nother federal ministries, as well as senior local officials in the Pyanj River Basin. The steering \ncommittee, which will be responsible for RETA oversight, will meet as needed, but at least three \ntimes per year. A technical secretariat with representatives primarily from MEW and MWRLR \nwill be established to support the work of the RETA and the steering committee. The secretariat, \nwhich will serve as the project management unit, will work closely with the technical specialists \nrecruited through the RETA and the steering committee to execute RETA activities. Local \nofficials are also expected to be a part of the technical secretariat and support efforts to improve \nflood warning, preparedness, and emergency response activities. The secretariat\u2019s composition \nwill be confirmed at RETA inception, but it will include a project director from each country. The \ntechnical secretariat will work full time to support RETA activities, and will operate as required in \nDushanbe,  Kabul,  and  the  field.  Standing  or  ad  hoc  committees  to  facilitate  community \nexchanges  will  be  established  to  support  work  under  the  RETA  and  facilitate  greater \ncooperation in flood management efforts. In addition, the governments will provide access to \noffice space in Dushanbe, Kabul, and the field, as required; access to telephones and utilities; \nand logistical support. The activities will be executed over 30 months beginning in the first \nquarter of 2008.  \n \n18.  The RETA will finance 40 person-months of international and 94 person-months of \nnational consulting input in water resources management, hydrology, hydrometeorology, flood \nmanagement engineering, geographic information systems, financial and economic analysis, \nsocial assessment, and environment. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. ADB will \nengage the consultants under the RETA in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time), using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod  through  a  simplified  technical  proposal.  Suitably  qualified  NGOs,  other  firms,  or \nindividual  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  needed  to  assist  with  necessary  community \nengagement, as well as for other technical studies and services. No activities will commence \nunder this RETA until a letter of no-objection has been received by ADB from the Governments \nof Afghanistan and Tajikistan. \n \n19.  Operating in Afghanistan presents security challenges. The RETA team will work closely \nwith the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, the Government, and the ADB \nsecurity advisor to develop a security plan for RETA execution. The RETA will contract local \nNGOs  that  are  well  established  in  the  area  to  deliver  services  and  facilitate  community \ninteraction  with  RETA  technical  specialists  and  other  RETA  staff.  Technical  work  can  be \nconducted from the Tajik side with limited exposure to the Afghan side. However, the two \ngovernments should be equally engaged. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,600,000 on a grant basis to the governments of Afghanistan \nand Tajikistan for the Pyanj River Basin Flood Management Project. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nThe RETA impact will be  Reduced damage and  Signed agreements  \u2022 Security risks in \nimproved water resources  from bank erosion and  become components of  northern Afghanistan \nmanagement and  floods by at least 10%  legislation in each country are eliminated in the \ndevelopment in the Pyanj    foreseeable future \nRiver Basin, and the  Better emergency  \u2022 Afghanistan \nimmediate reduction in  response to flood  governance is strong \nnegative impacts from  disaster  enough to provide \nfloods and bank erosion.     effective planning and \nData from both \n  development. \ngovernments, especially \n \nMEW and MWRLR, \nRisks \nfollowing future floods \n \n  \u2022 One or both \nMonitoring systems set \ngovernments is \nup by the RETA \nunwilling to sign \n \nagreements. \nADB review missions for \n\u2022 One government does \nthe RETA \nnot or cannot comply \n \nMonitoring through  with agreements, thus \nADB\u2019s subsequent  leading to asymmetric \nWater Resources  flood management \nManagement Project   measures. \n   \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nThe RETA outcome will be  Improved understanding  Post-flood reports by both  \u2022 Previous and existing \nimproved knowledge,  of data needs, data, and  governments  flood damage can be \nincreased capacity, and  data management with  valued. \nstrengthened institutions  regard to floods and  \u2022 Future flood damage \nfor planning and  basin management in  avoidance will be \nmanagement of the Pyanj  the Pyanj River Basin,  measurable. \nRiver Basin with a focus  including the   \non flood management.  hydrometeorological,  Risk \n  network, hydrology, and   \n  morphology  \u2022 Implementation of \n  flood management \nImproved planning for  measures by one or \nflood management and  both governments is \nfor response to flood  slow, thus delaying the \ndisaster in the Pyanj  realization of benefits \nRiver Basin  beyond a reasonable \n  time horizon. \nImproved bilateral   \ncooperation and   \nstrengthened institutions \nfor flood and basin \nmanagement in the \nPyanj River Basin \n \nImproved capacity for \nrelated agencies and \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \ncommunities in the \nPyanj River Basin with \nregard to flood and \nbasin management and \nflood emergency \nresponse \n \nAll achieved by the end \nof the RETA \n \nMonitoring systems set \nup by the RETA \n \nADB review missions for \nthe RETA \n \nMonitoring through \nADB\u2019s subsequent \nWater Resources \nManagement Project  \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n       \n1.
