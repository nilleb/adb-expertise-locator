At the time of processing the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the \nNorth Eastern State Roads Project,1 the Government of India requested assistance to increase \nthe capacity of the region\u2019s road authorities to better manage the ensuing loan project and \nimprove  the  performance  of  the  road  network  in  the  long  run.  To  that  end,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) included an advisory TA2 in the 2004\u20132006 country strategy and \nprogram update. The Fact-Finding Mission and the Consultation Mission visited India during 28 \nMarch\u20138  April  2005,  and  31  August\u20131  September  2005,  respectively,  and  reached  an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  goals,  objectives,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, financing plan, and terms of reference. The TA design and monitoring framework \nis attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Significance of the Road Sector. The north eastern region (NER) of India, which \ncomprises eight states3 spanning 262,000 square kilometers (km2), about 8% of India\u2019s total \nland area and home to about 4% of the nation\u2019s population, is unique in many ways. It shares \nborders with five countries,4 but its formal travel and trade are largely domestic. The region\u2019s \nstate  capitals  are  experiencing  very  fast  urban  growth,  primarily  due  to  migration  from \ninfrastructure-deficient rural areas. State population densities range from about 40 persons per \nkm2 in Mizoram to 339 in Assam. The region\u2019s economy is primarily agrarian. NER produces \nover 75% of Indian tea, with Assam contributing more than 50%. The existing industrial base \nrevolves around oil and gas, wood, and food products. \n \n3.  The Government has initiated several transport-related activities that would increase the \nefficiency of freight and passenger flow, and improve the region\u2019s economy and living standards \nof the people. Among the activities are: (i) bilateral discussions on issues such as transit traffic \nthrough  Bangladesh,  (ii)  simplification  of  border  formalities  for  traffic  between  Nepal  and \nBangladesh via India, (iii) a move to build land communications connecting India and Myanmar, \nand (iv) opening of a land route between India and the People\u2019s Republic of China through \nSikkim. However, development is mired by the low quality of existing transport infrastructure, \nunreliable services, restriction on transit traffic through Bangladesh, and the largely hilly and \nrolling terrain. The region\u2019s surface connections with the rest of India is constrained by the low-\ncapacity  road  and  rail  links  through  the  22  km  wide  strip  of  land  between  Bhutan  and \nBangladesh. Over 90% of inter- and intra-regional trade and personal travel depend on the \npresent road network, which is sparse and comprises mostly substandard single-lane roads. \nPaved road network density is about 27 km per 100 km2 compared with the national average of \nabout 61 km per 100 km2 of land total area. Except in Assam, railways and scheduled air \nservices are limited, and Kalkota, the closest international gateway, is over 1,500 km away from \nmost state capitals of the region.  \n \n4.  In principle, the public works department (PWD) of each of the eight states in the NER \nholds  the  primary  responsibility  for  policy  development,  design,  procurement,  construction, \nmaintenance,  and  management  of  the  state\u2019s  road  network.5  However,  some  key \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to India for preparing the North Eastern State Roads Project. Manila (TA 4378, \napproved on 23 August 2004, for $800,000). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 9 June 2005. \n3  Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura. \n4  Bangladesh, Bhutan, People\u2019s Republic of China (Tibet), Myanmar, and Nepal. \n5  Except in Meghalaya and Sikkim, PWDs are also responsible for public buildings. ", "2   \nresponsibilities, which have direct impacts on road sector performance, are shared with other \nstate agencies such as the planning departments,6 finance departments, transport departments, \npolice departments, and revenue departments. \n \n5.  The poor condition of more than half of NER\u2019s road network, low accomplishment rates \nof road maintenance activities, high costs, underutilized workforce and equipment, low cost-\nrecovery from road users in relation to the damage caused to infrastructure, and inconsistent \nenforcement of road traffic laws are partly attributable to the multiagency regulatory framework. \nThey are symptomatic of inadequate investment planning, weak financial management, under-\nskilled and undertrained workforce, and lack of accountability. Inadequate investment is also \npart cause of the low asset value, but lack of tools and skills for informed decision making is \nwhat has prevented asset value from being enhanced in proportion to the level of investment. \n  \n6.  PWDs in the NER are overstaffed compared with those in other states in India. The \nnumber  of  employees  range  from  18  per  100  km  in  Arunachal  Pradesh  (involved  in \nconstruction) to 100 per 100 km in Tripura. According to the World Bank, the corresponding \nfigure in other parts of India range from 10 to 20, with some states having as low as 3. Hiring of \nnew employees has been frozen in many NERs states for over a decade. While that has \nreduced the total workforce, productivity has not increased due to the agencies\u2019 inability to \nmaintain the needed skill diversity and expose employees to emerging techniques such as \nadvanced contracting methods and project management. PWD staff recognizes the need to \nincrease asset value and productivity, and are eager to employ the best practices in road asset \nmanagement and state-of-the-art project management tools, but present opportunities to learn \nand adopt them are limited and costly.  \n \n7.  A central Government-funded infrastructure development program aimed at upgrading \nabout 3,000 km of roads is already in the pipeline, and several key state and urban roads are \nexpected to be improved with external funding in the next 5 years, thereby increasing the \nregion\u2019s road stock. However, major policy, legislative, technological, and operational changes \nwill be required to eliminate some of the root causes of poor road quality, connectivity, and \nasset performance. Some changes will take time and will be costly to implement. Others such \nas  technological  and  operational  changes  can  be  introduced  relatively  rapidly  and \ninexpensively. One technological change, which has proven effective in both developing and \ndeveloped countries, is a shift to computer-aided asset management systems, which allow road \nnetwork  data  on  pavement  condition,  traffic  volumes,  accident  records,  construction  and \nmaintenance activities to be used in conjunction with policies, and technical and economic \ncriteria  to  generate  solutions  to  selected  problems.  That,  together  with  systematic  project \nmanagement,  can  help  significantly  reduce  suboptimal  investment  decisions,  project \nimplementation delays, and cost-overruns.  \n \n8.  Funding Agency Activities and Lessons Learned. The World Bank has been actively \nsupporting India\u2019s road sector development, and has been a strong advocate of road agency \nreforms that permit better asset management. It has repeatedly emphasized that information \nflow must be advanced if asset management is to improve. In previous state road development \nprojects in southern Indian states, the World Bank prepared institutional development plans, \naccording  to  which  some  states  corporatized  the  PWDs  and  commenced  large-scale \noutsourcing  of  works  of  all  types.  The  agency  proposes  to  advance  the  concept  of \ncommercialization of PWDs in the forthcoming state road development projects in Punjab and \n                                                 \n6  State planning boards in some states. \n ", "  3\nAssam. No direct external assistance at present for computerizing road asset management in \nthe NER is reported.  \n \n9.  ADB  continues  to  finance  state  road  improvements  that  strengthen  rural-urban \nconnections and link poor rural producers to markets in towns, cities, and ports. It is also \nenabling state road agencies to enhance their capacity to better manage the networks. Two \nongoing state road projects in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisghar have shown that advance \nplanning and better management of projects are critical for making the right investments and \nsustaining the value of the investments.  \n \n10.  The road asset management system financed by ADB in Papua New Guinea7 is now \nused  to  plan  and  program  all  road  works.  Its  use  recognizes  the  efficiency  gains  from \ncomputerization and willingness of road agencies to employ technology to increase productivity. \nThe present TA is designed to ensure sustainability\u2013which is at risk in Papua New Guinea due \nto the transfer of trained staff to other positions\u2013by training trainers. Additionally, updating and \nupkeep of the system will be ensured through the trainers. Wider application of the system will \nbe promoted through support under ADB\u2019s ensuing north eastern state roads loan project. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA will facilitate long-term preservation of road assets in the NER. The capacity of \nNER\u2019s PWDs will be increased to allow: (i) computer-based road asset management tools and \n(ii) state-of-the-art project management techniques to be widely employed, thereby improving \nthe quality of the roads and increasing the productivity of labor and capital during and after the \nensuing loan project is implemented.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  ADB will recruit a firm of international consultants working with domestic experts to \nprovide the TA. The consultants will use the findings of the PPTA consultants and consult with \nPWDs in NER to understand the present methods of (i) road asset management, and (ii) project \nmanagement. Based on that understanding and a review of management systems such as \nthose used by PWDs in Gujarat, Karanataka, and Maharashtra the consultants will design and \ninstall a computerized asset management system. The system will be field-tested (calibrated) on \nthe road network of Meghalaya in conjunction with the state PWD. The consultants will also \ndetermine the level and type of training needed, and conduct training workshops and organize \nnational or international technical tours to demonstrate system applications, and provide hands-\non experience to selected PWD staff from each NER state. A separate set of in-state training \nworkshops  on  project  management  will  also  be  conducted  for  PWD  staff.  That  training \ncomponent will include, but will not be limited to, contracting out, contract administration, dispute \nresolution, quality control, use of project management software, technical tours, and compliance \nmonitoring, especially for ADB-financed projects. The sites and content of the technical tours \nwill be discussed and finalized during the tripartite review meeting, to be held within 6 months of \nTA  commencement,  to  allow  a  complete  assessment  of  the  existing  level  of  know-how, \nexperience, and the computer system to be implemented. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for the Road Asset Management System. Manila (TA \n3004, approved on 3 April 1998 for $1,000,000). \n ", "4   \n13.   The consultants will produce a computerized database and decision support system \n(validated and verified in Meghalaya) that could be adapted by any PWD in the NER. The TA \nwill support training for at least one PWD engineer from each NER state in the use of the \ncomputerized system for managing assets and system upkeep, and one engineer in project \nmanagement. At least two trainers will be fully equipped to continue training more PWD staff in \nasset and project management. In developing the asset management system, the consultants \nwill (i) review the PPTA consultants\u2019 report; (ii) review well-proven asset management systems \nin India and abroad to determine technical and other merits and demerits of each; (iii) prepare \nan inception report outlining the pros and cons of alternative systems, recommend a system to \nbe adopted, together with its specifications and costs, and tests and training to be provided; (iv) \nin consultation with the Ministry of Development of the North Eastern Region (MDONER), \ntogether with Meghalaya PWD, and ADB, select, implement, and field-test the system; (v) \nprepare  explanatory  and  training  documentation;  (vi)  organize  technical  tours  and  conduct \ntraining workshops; and (vii) train two trainers. In the case of project management training, the \nconsultants  will  prepare  training  manuals,  organize  and  conduct  workshops,  and  train  two \ntrainers to provide follow-up training. At the end of this TA, the consultants will prepare a final \nreport  describing  the  asset  management  system,  and  the  training  provided  on  asset \nmanagement and project management. The report will describe the strengths and weaknesses \nof  the  selected  management  systems,  enumerate  resources  needed  for  maintaining  and \nupgrading the systems, describe the level of understanding of the trained persons, include tests \nused for evaluating training effectiveness, and list proposals for continuing training and upkeep \nof the systems.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1.125 million equivalent, of which $422,100 \nis  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $702,900  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance $900,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $477,900 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency  cost,  equivalent  to  $225,000,  through  the  provision  of  office  space,  data,  and \ncounterpart staff. Details of the costs and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  MDONER will serve as the Executing Agency. It will appoint a project director to be \nresponsible for administering the TA, including supervising the work of the consultants, liaising \nbetween the consultant team and relevant agencies, and coordinating with ADB. MDONER will \nrequire the PWDs to nominate staff to serve as counterparts to the consultants in areas such as \n(i)  pavement  management,  and  (ii)  construction  supervision.  To  facilitate  technology  and \nknowledge transfer, counterpart staff of at least four persons from PWDs will work full-time \nalongside the TA consultants who will establish a field office in Shillong. \n \n16.  The TA will require 29 person-months (11 international and 18 domestic) of consulting \nservices from an international consulting firm to be engaged by ADB using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other \narrangements acceptable to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. \nThe international consultants will include specialists with at least 15 years of experience in each \nof the following areas (person-months are in parentheses): (i) transportation engineering/team \nleadership  (6),  (ii)  road  construction/project  management  (3),  and  (iii)  training  program \ndevelopment and workshop facilitation (2). The domestic consultants (each to provide 6 person-\n ", "  5\nmonths of input) will include specialists with at least 10 years of experience in each of the \nfollowing areas: (i) highway and bridge engineering, (ii) information technology and database \nmanagement, and (iii) training and education. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are \nin Appendix 3.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months starting in April 2006. MDONER will form a \nproject steering committee (PSC), which will be chaired by the director of MDONER or his/her \nnominee, and include representatives from relevant agencies including NEC and BRO. PSC \nmembers will participate in the inception, interim, and final tripartite meetings; evaluate the \ntechnical outputs of the consultants; and provide guidance as needed. \n \n18.  Project and asset management software, and hardware comprising personal computers, \ncolor laser printers, one plotter, global positioning systems as well as digital video/still cameras, \nand appropriate accessories will be procured by the international consultants according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. At the end of the Project, all hardware and software together \nwith spares and other accessories procured under the TA will be handed over to MDONER. \n \n19.  To facilitate timely implementation and successful completion of the TA, MDONER will \nprovide the following: (i) documentation necessary for international consultants to obtain visas, \ncustoms  clearances,  etc.,  to  enable  them  to  perform  the  tasks  specified  in  the  terms  of \nreference; (ii) copies of technical reports, drawings as well as general information such as maps \nand databases that will add value to the TA; (iii) counterpart staff to work with the consultants; \nand  (iv)  office  space  in  Shillong  with  appropriate  furnishings,  fixtures,  fittings,  and \ncommunication lines. MDONER will assist the participants in technical tours to secure official \ntravel documentation and authorizations from the relevant agencies in India and abroad, in case \nforeign tour sites are chosen. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for Development of Road Agencies in the North Eastern States, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance   Data  Assumptions and \nTargets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact        \nPreservation of road  \u2022  Increase in asset  PPTA report and PWDs   \nassets  value  baseline, periodic, and \n\u2022  Increase in economic  post-implementation \nreturn on road  data to ADB during \ninvestment  ensuing loan project \n\u2022  Percent of annual \nchange in number of \nprojects completed \non time \n\u2022  Percent of annual \nchange in length of \nroads in the network \nrated to be in good \ncondition \nOutcome      Assumptions  \nIncreased asset and  \u2022  Number of PWDs  Tripartite meetings,  \u2022  PWDs maintain and \nproject management  agreeing to adopt the  PPTA report, and data  update the system \ncapacity of PWDs in the  asset and project  submitted to ADB  according to \nnorth eastern region of  management  specifications. \nIndia  systems at the end of  \u2022  Annual road sector \nthe TA   funding increases or \n  remains at present \nlevels. \n \nRisk  \n\u2022  PWD investment and \npreservation \nprograms are not \napproved by state \nplanning authorities. \nOutputs      Assumptions  \n1.
