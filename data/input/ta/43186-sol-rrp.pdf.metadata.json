The \nERSP  will assist in adjusting to an economic and fiscal deterioration \naggravated  by  the  global  economic  crisis.  The  program  will  support \nimproved  fiscal  management  and  structural  measures  that  will  aid \neconomic recovery. Budget support will help protect the delivery of basic \nservices to the vulnerable and be complemented by actions to engage \nwith key stakeholders. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSectors (subsectors): Multisector (public sector management; transport, \nand  information  and  communication  technology;  heath  and  social \nprotection) \nThemes  (subthemes):  Economic  growth  (promoting  macroeconomic \nstability,  promoting  economic  efficiency  and  enabling  business \nenvironment, widening access to markets and economic opportunities), \ngovernance  (economic  and  financial  governance),  private  sector \ndevelopment (policy reforms) \nLocation impact: National (high impact) \n   \nEnvironment  Category C. No significant adverse environmental impacts identified. \nAssessment \n   \nSocial Safeguards  Involuntary resettlement: Category C \nAssessment  Impact of indigenous people: Category C \nNo involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected. \n   \nRationale and  The Solomon Islands economy has been among the most affected in the \nDescription  Pacific by the global economic crisis. Global events have brought forward \na sharp economic slowdown that had been expected between 2009 and \n2015 as natural forest resources approached exhaustion. Gross domestic \nproduct  growth  averaged  7.3%  per  annum  in  the  5  years  to  2008. \nPreliminary  estimates  are  of  little  or  no  economic  growth  in  2009. \nEconomic  stagnation  is  looming  in  the  absence  of  a  concerted \ngovernment response to the economic deterioration. \n \nWithout  policy  action  and  additional  external  financial  assistance,  the \ngovernment  faces  the  prospect  of  exhausting  its  cash  reserves  and \naccumulating large expenditure arrears. No fiscal space would be left for \nadditional government-funded development spending and much needed \nimprovements  in  public  service  delivery.  Such  developments  would \nundermine prospects for diversifying away from dependence on logging \nand foreign aid and achieving higher, socially inclusive economic growth. \n \nThe government has requested support from development partners to \nachieve economic adjustment. Early, prudent action can help reduce the \neconomic  and  fiscal  imbalances  aggravated  by  the  global  economic ", "ii   \ncrisis.  This  can  in  turn  help  avoid  the  re-emergence  of  potentially \ndestabilizing social tensions. The ERSP provides the contribution of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  a  collaborative  response  by  key \ndevelopment partners to the government\u2019s request. \n \nThe  program  will  help  realize  the  private  sector\u2019s  potential,  and \nspecifically the growth potential of the mining, agriculture, fishing, and \ntourism industries. Progress is being made toward reopening a large gold \nmine closed during past civil unrest, and there is a potential to develop \nlarge nickel deposits. The best prospects for creating jobs and generating \ngovernment revenue lie in large-scale palm oil developments, in fishing \n(there is already one large fish cannery), and in the smallholder tree \ncrops of cocoa and copra. The supply of fruit and vegetables to the urban \ncenters also offers good prospects, as does the fledgling tourism industry.\n \nThe  ERSP  is  anchored  in  the  Solomon  Islands  Medium  Term \nDevelopment Strategy 2008\u20132010, supporting sector plans, and the 2009 \nand 2010 budgets. The program design is aligned with a policy matrix \nprepared by the government to identify key fiscal measures and structural \npolicy actions. A core economic working group was established by the  \ngovernment, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands and \nkey development partners in March 2009. The group was central to the \npreparation  of  the  government\u2019s  policy  matrix.  Through  the  core \neconomic working group, key development partners have committed to \nsupport implementation of the government\u2019s policy matrix. \n \nThe ESRP builds on the macroeconomic assessment prepared by the \nInternational Monetary Fund through its 2009 Article IV Consultation. The \nconsultation  concluded  that  new  external  assistance  in  the  form  of \nbudget support can provide a cushion for undertaking more lasting \nfiscal adjustment and improving budget execution. The International \nMonetary Fund estimated a budget financing gap for the medium term of \n$25 million per year (around 4% of gross domestic product). \n \nThe ERSP has four output areas: (i) improved fiscal management, (ii) \nproductivity enhancing structural initiatives, (iii) support for the vulnerable, \nand (iv) communication and ownership of policy actions. Subprograms 1 \nand 2 support the same four output areas, and these will be progressed \nconcurrently under each subprogram. \n \nOutput (i) targets fiscal sustainability. This is to ensure the government \nhas the financial capacity to provide the investment and services needed \nto support economic growth and development over the medium term. \nPublic financial management is also to be improved under output (i), \nlifting the standard of governance and addressing priority needs identified \nin a 2008 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment. \n \nOutput (ii) will implement reform measures that can build the productive \nbase of the economy. This will help lift economic growth and diversify the \neconomy away from unsustainable logging and foreign aid. The areas of \nfocus are: (i) state-owned enterprises, so as to improve their efficiency, ", "i ii \nreduce their drain on the budget, and reduce crowding out of the private \nsector; (ii) deregulation of the telecommunications industry, to expand \nservice coverage, raise standards, and reduce prices; (iii) the business \nregulatory environment, so as to directly reduce costs of doing business \nin Solomon Islands; and (iv) transport infrastructure, in order to raise \ninvestment  levels  and  service  standards  in  infrastructure  and  thereby \nreduce transport costs for business while improving access to health and \neducation facilities and to markets. \n \nOutput  (iii)  is  to  help  protect  the  vulnerable  from  the  effects  of  the \neconomic slowdown. Additional financial resources provided by ADB will \nreduce a budget financing gap, thereby helping to preserve the delivery of \nbasic transport services, rural health services, and basic education. \n \nOutput (iv) brings stakeholders into the adjustment process in support of \ncontinued country ownership of the program. Close attention will be paid \nunder  output  (iv)  to  communicating  the  government\u2019s  strategy  for \nlessening  the  impact  of  the  global  economic  crisis  and  bridging \ncommunication gaps between economic stakeholders. \n   \nImpact and  The impact of the ERSP will be the achievement of a higher and more \nOutcome  inclusive path of economic growth. The outcome of the program will be \ninitiation of economic recovery with extra protection for the vulnerable and \nthe fiscal position.  \n   \nSpecial Features  The  core  economic  working  group  process  established  by  the \ngovernment has been critical to the formulation of a single government-\nled policy matrix supported by key development partners. \n \nSupport for the vulnerable is a feature of the program, in recognition of \nthe extra hardship imposed by the global economic crisis and a preceding \nepisode of high inflation. This support will help preserve the delivery of \nessential services to the most vulnerable. It is also proposed the ERSP \nwill link to a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant for social protection \nthat will support the piloting of social safety nets and associated policy \ndevelopment. \n   \nPeriod and  The program cluster period will be from 1 March 2009 to 28 February \nTranching  2012. A single tranche grant of $5.0 million is to be disbursed under \nsubprogram  1  when  the  government  has  met  the  conditions  for \neffectiveness. For subprogram 2, a single tranche grant of $5.0 million will \nbe  presented  for  consideration  and  approval  by  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors based on the progress achieved in implementing subprogram 1, \nincluding the status of compliance with the proposed policy actions and \nthe  readiness  of  the  government  to  undertake  the  succeeding  policy \nreform measures. Subprogram 2 is expected to be considered by the \nBoard about 12 months after subprogram 1 grant effectiveness. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a cluster of grants totaling $10.0 million, comprising two \nsubprograms of $5.0 million each, from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund \non terms and conditions set forth in the draft grant agreement. \n ", "iv   \n   \nProcurement and  Grant proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member \nDisbursement  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  from  other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. The grant proceeds will be disbursed to \nthe Borrower in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. \n   \nCounterpart  The government shall ensure that the local currency generated from the \nFunds  proceeds  of  the  grants  will  be  used  to  support  public  expenditure \nobjectives under the program. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  will  be  the  executing  and \nand  implementing agency. The Ministry shall be supported by the Central \nImplementation  Bank of Solomon Islands and relevant central and line agencies of the \nArrangements  recipient.  The  core  economic  working  group  will  be  the  program \ncoordinating committee and shall hold a special meeting on the program \nat  least  quarterly  to  monitor  progress  and  provide  guidance  to  the \nprogram\u2019s implementation. \n   \nBenefits  The program will provide broadly distributed benefits by helping lessen \nthe negative impacts of the global economic crisis and achieving higher, \nprivate sector-led economic growth over the medium to long term. The \nmost vulnerable members of the community will benefit from the support \nto economic growth and a preferential treatment of priority services by the \nbudget process. \n   \nRisks and  Key risks are that (i) political instability weakens fiscal discipline and \nAssumptions  policy commitment, particularly in the lead-up to the 2010 election; (ii) \nthere is insufficient capacity in government to implement the program; (iii) \nthe revenue position of the government deteriorates and impedes service \ndelivery; and (iv) excessive growth in expenditure crowds out essential \nexpenditure, making it difficult to achieve and capitalize on the policy \nactions linked to the program. \n \nProgram design mitigates these risks. The extension of the ERSP beyond \nthe 2010 general election will provide the flexibility to align the program \nwith the commitment and policy agenda of any new government. The \ncommunications  and  engagement  strategy  will  build  community \nawareness and demand for the program. Technical assistance will be \nprovided on a selective basis to supplement the expertise needed to \nimplement key policy actions. The risk of fiscal slippage will be lessened \nthrough  an  explicit  focus  in  the  ERSP  on  fiscal  discipline  and  the \nprovision of technical assistance on economic and fiscal management. \n \nThe ERSP also relies on (i) an improvement in the global economy; (ii) a \npositive response by the private sector to improved economic conditions; \n(iii) a commitment of government agencies to improved performance; (iv) \nthe  provision  of  complementary  financial  and  technical  resources  by \ndevelopment  partners;  and  (v)  the  continued  operation  of  key \ncoordinating  mechanisms,  notably  the  monthly  monetary  monitoring \nmeeting and the core economic working group. ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster comprising two subprograms to Solomon Islands for the Economic Recovery \nSupport Program (ERSP), and (ii) a proposed grant to the Solomon Islands for subprogram 1 of \nthe ERSP. The ERSP was prepared by a joint team of representatives of the Government of \nSolomon  Islands  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. The development policy letter, including the policy matrix for \nsubprogram 1 and triggers for subprogram 2, is in Appendix 2.  \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n \nA.  Development Performance \n2.  Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita grew slowly over Solomon Islands\u2019 first two \ndecades of independence (granted in 1978). The slow development progress reflected a failure \nto  ensure  adequate  infrastructure  development,  as  well  as  sound  economic  and  natural \nresource management and public administration (Appendixes 3, 4, and 5). An outbreak of civil \nunrest in 1999 evidenced the severity of the problems. Successive administrations had failed to \nprovide the leadership and policies to address the underlying causes of civil conflict (uneven \nregional development, uneven distribution of public resources, land issues, and a rising youth \npopulation with little education and poor job prospects) and then proved incapable of imposing \nlaw and order.1 The civil conflict lasted to 2003, resulting in hundreds of deaths and displacing \nover 20,000 people. Much of the post-independence income growth was lost (Figure 1).  \n3.  Military and police forces arrived in July 2003 with the Regional Assistance Mission to \nSolomon Islands (RAMSI).2 Civil order was quickly restored and has generally been maintained, \nexcept for mob riots in Honiara in April 2006. A surge in foreign aid under the umbrella of \nRAMSI  then  funded  large  increases  in  development  budget  spending  that  lifted  total \ngovernment expenditure (Figure 2). This initiated a post-conflict recovery. As the stimulus from \nrising aid leveled off, forestry, agriculture, and fishing activity expanded and kept economic \ngrowth at relatively high levels to 2008. The post-conflict growth surge saw a recovery in \naverage incomes. \n4.  RAMSI  has  also  been  instrumental  in  helping  begin  the  rebuilding  of  the  state. \nGovernment finances have been brought under better control through improved public financial \nmanagement practices. Business confidence, especially amongst traders and retailers, has \nimproved  with  the  restoration  of  law  and  order.  The  task  of  rebuilding  the  machinery  of \ngovernment  is  ongoing,  through  technical  assistance  (TA)  programs  for  strengthening \nParliament, key watchdog agencies (such as the Office of the Auditor General), the public \nservice, and provincial governments.  \n                                                 \n1  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2004.

Honiara (p. 5). \n2  RAMSI is a partnership between the government and people of Solomon Islands and 15 contributing countries \nfrom the Pacific region. It is a long-term exercise aimed at helping create the conditions necessary for a return to \nstability, peace, and a growing economy. RAMSI was deployed on 24 July 2003, with a mandate unanimously \napproved by the Solomon Islands National Parliament, to help the Government of Solomon Islands restore law and \norder, strengthen government institutions, reduce corruption, and reinvigorate the economy.

The post-conflict growth surge has masked deep problems in the economy, which has \nbecome dependent on very high levels of foreign aid and unsustainably high rates of logging. \nThe government has continued to capture too little of the resource rent from logging, even as \nlogging rates grew to five times the sustainable rate in 2007. It has been known for some time \nthere would be a sharp drop in logging, probably starting around 2009, and natural forest \nresources are expected to be largely exhausted before 2015. Logging rates could have been \ncurbed to extend the life of natural forests, or the unsustainably high income could have been \nsaved to smooth the inevitable drop-off in logging income. Such preventative action was not \ntaken, however. ", "  3\n6.  Political  instability  and  poor  accountability  and  transparency  in  government  remain, \nfuelled by weaknesses in the institutional environment.3 These weaknesses have undermined \nthe effectiveness of government, which in turn has slowed economic growth and continues to \nseverely restrain economic prospects. Solomon Islands is likely to remain a weakly performing \ncountry with a fragile state until such shortcomings are addressed. In response, the government \nhas adopted a broad-ranging development strategy. This Medium Term Development Strategy \n(MTDS) 2008\u20132010 seeks to provide the missing foundations of growth and development.4 \n7.  Economic growth prospects rest on the private sector and on developments in mining, \nagriculture, fishing, and, to a lesser extent, tourism. Progress is being made toward reopening a \nlarge gold mine closed during the civil unrest, and there is potential over the longer term to \ndevelop large nickel deposits. While mining projects would boost GDP, the sector would employ \nfew people and there would be long lags before government revenues rose as a result. The best \nprospects  for  creating  jobs  and  boosting  government  revenues  lie  in  large-scale  palm  oil \ndevelopments, in fishing (there is already one large fish cannery), and in the smallholder tree \ncrops  of  cocoa  and  copra.  The  supply  of  fruit  and  vegetables  to  the  urban  centers  as  a \nsubstitute for imports also offers good prospects, as does the fledgling tourism industry. \n8.  A number of recent studies have examined economic growth prospects under various \nscenarios (Appendix 3). The studies have identified the potential for economic growth after \nlogging, albeit at only low to moderate rates that would see at best slow growth in real GDP per \ncapita  in  the  medium  term.  The  studies  have  also  highlighted  the  necessity  of  concerted \ngovernment action to realize the potential growth (notably through increased investment in \ninfrastructure, efforts to improve the enabling environment for the private sector, governance \nreform, and maintaining macroeconomic stability) and the downside risk of inaction. \nB.  Impact of the Global Economic Crisis \n1.  Macroeconomic Impact \n9.  The Solomon Islands economy has been among the most affected in the Pacific by the \nglobal economic crisis. The global economic crisis has brought forward the sharp economic \nslowdown that was expected between 2009 and 2015 as natural forest logging comes to an \nend. GDP growth averaged 7.3% per annum in the 5 years to 2008. Preliminary estimates are \nof little or no overall economic growth in 2009. Economic data suggest the rural economy \ncontracted over 2009.5 \n10.  The value of goods and services exports was down by more than 20% over the first \nthree quarters of 2009 compared to the same period of 2008. The drop was driven by decline in \nlogging, copra, and fishing. Export volumes of these commodities were down by 29%, 46%, and \n23%, respectively, over the first three quarters of 2009 compared to the same period of 2008. \nPalm oil export volumes however continued to rise, while cocoa volumes increased slightly over \nthe first three quarters of 2009. The current account deficit is projected to have reached 11% of \n                                                 \n3  The 2006 riots demonstrated the potential consequences of the unstable political environment. During the riots, \nParliament House was surrounded by protesters and many premises linked to Asian business interests were \ndamaged or destroyed. The riots were incited by politicians who did not support the choice of prime minister \nfollowing the general elections held that month. The nominated prime minister resigned when it became clear he \nwould lose a vote of no confidence, just as his successor had in December 2007. \n4  Government of Solomon Islands, Ministry of Development Planning and Aid Coordination. 2008.

Pacific Economic Monitor. Various editions.  \n ", "4   \nGDP in 2009 and to reach 18% of GDP in 2010. The deterioration in exports was originally \nexpected to push reserves fall below the central bank\u2019s target of 3 months of imports in 2009 \nand to remain below target in 2010. \n11.  Inflation peaked at 25% year on year in August 2008, pushed up by a combination of \nhigh fuel prices and excess domestic demand. Inflation has since moderated, averaging around \n8.0% in 2009. Inflation is expected to remain relatively high in 2010 at around 8% because of \nthe recent increase in world oil prices. \n12.  Economic stagnation is looming in the absence of a concerted government response to \nthe economic deterioration. The rural economy is likely to be hit much harder than is Honiara\u2019s. \nThis is because the deterioration is led by a fall in international prices for tree crops and logging \nactivity, while high levels of foreign aid will continue to support economic activity in the capital. \n13.  Despite deterioration in the merchandise trade balance, however, the foreign reserves \nposition is better than originally expected. Lower world oil prices in late 2008 and early 2009, the \nbringing forward of foreign aid, an allocation of special drawing rights by the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), and a one-off internal transaction by one of the commercial banks helped \nlift reserves from below the Central Bank of Solomon Islands\u2019 comfort levels to 5 months of \nimports by end-November 2009. \n2.  Fiscal Impact \n14.  The real value of government tax revenue almost doubled over the 5 years to 2008, but \na revenue shortfall emerged over the first half of 2009 as the economy slowed and continued \nthrough the remainder of the year. The 2009 budget had forecast domestically sourced revenue \nat SI$1,642 million for 2009, but actual collections were only SI$1,420 million. The weakening in \nrevenue, combined with a government commitment to not borrow, necessitated widespread \nspending cuts. In April 2009, nonpayroll recurrent expenditure was cut by 10% and civil service \nhiring was frozen. A further temporary 25% cut (termed a reservation) was made on nonpayroll \nrecurrent  expenditure,  to  be  reversed  in  the  December  quarter  if  funding  allowed  (the \nreservation was relaxed in late October). Large cuts were also made to domestically financed \ndevelopment outlays. The general public sector wage increase for 2009 was kept to 4.5%, \nimplying a reduction in real terms of around 3.5% over the year. Offsetting these measures, \nhowever, were two supplementary appropriation bills which authorized a range of new spending \nmeasures  (totaling  3.7%  of  total  expenditure  and  1.7%  of  GDP).  Items  funded  under  the \nsupplementary appropriations include a compensation payment for Solomon Telekom, disaster \nrelief, election funding, scholarships, rural electrification, and minor building works. \n15.  Even with the expenditure cuts, arrears rose over the year and cash reserves declined \nbelow the level needed for normal operations. Service delivery was adversely affected and \ninfrastructure investment and maintenance were underfunded.6 The latest information from the \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) is that the fiscal situation remained tight in early 2010. \n                                                 \n6  Notably, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development fully utilized its revised budget for maintenance work by \nSeptember, and it was unable to issue contracts fast enough to utilize funds made available in October\u2013November \nwhen the 25% reservation was relaxed. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services also had fully utilized its \nrevised, locally funded budget for goods and services by September and was relying on a reallocation of budget \nsupport from Australia to supplement its operations. ", "  5\n3.  Poverty and Gender Impacts \n16.  The economic slowdown is occurring in a context of rapid population growth, high levels \nof urban unemployment, high poverty rates, and gender imbalances (Appendixes 6 and 7). \nTighter constraints on public service delivery arising from the revenue deterioration have the \npotential to place extra pressure on the vulnerable, who have poor access to basic services and \nlimited income-earning and employment opportunities. Approximately one-third of the population \nis estimated to live below the basic-needs poverty line. Households headed by women are \ndisproportionately represented among those living in poverty. Many households also live just \nabove the poverty line and can drop into poverty as conditions deteriorate. The vulnerable within \nthe community are more exposed to the negative impacts of the economic slowdown and have \nfewer reserves with which to meet their needs. \n17.  Women in particular are likely to face greater impacts from the economic slowdown \nbecause of tighter constraints on access to essential public services. Gender disparities are \nsignificant in education, as girls are often pulled out of school for economic reasons. Fertility \nrates are high, and women\u2019s access to health and family planning services are poor (especially \nin rural areas), as indicated by a high maternal mortality rate. Poor access to basic infrastructure \n(e.g., roads, clean water, and sanitation) generates additional burden on women\u2019s lives that \nlimits their time and opportunity for productive and income-generating activities. Actions to \nmaintain access to the limited services that are available is central to limiting the adverse social \nimpact of the economic slowdown. \nC.  International Monetary Fund Assessment \n18.  The IMF 2009 Article IV staff report concludes that growth in the medium term will \nremain below trend and that \u201clarge and potentially destabilizing macroeconomic imbalances \ncould emerge, necessitating sizable policy adjustment, as well as new exceptional financing.\u201d7 \nModest growth is expected from 2010 to 2011, before a projected commencement of gold \nproduction in 2012 accelerates economic growth and improves the current account position and \nbalance of payments (Table 1).8 \n19.  The strain on the fiscal and current account positions that emerged in 2009 is projected \nby IMF to intensify prior to recovery over the medium term. An annual budget financing gap of \n4% of GDP ($25 million) is projected for 2010 and 2011.9 An external financing gap on a similar \norder is expected. In recognition of the worsening fiscal situation, the IMF urged the government \nto pursue a cohesive strategy for easing the cash constraint, including to seek new budget \nsupport. Building a cash cushion is seen by the IMF as a means of providing the space required \nto improve budget execution and to implement lasting public financial management (PFM) \nreforms and fiscal adjustment. The latter is regarded as an important component of ensuring \nexternal balance over the medium term, but greater exchange rate flexibility is identified as the \nkey policy instrument for stemming foreign reserve losses.  \n                                                 \n7  IMF. 2009.

Solomon Islands: 2009 Article IV Consultation\u2014Staff Report. Washington, DC (November). \n \nD.  Policy Dialogue \n20.  In March 2009, the government initiated a regular dialogue with development partners \nunder  the  umbrella  of  a  core  economic  working  group  (CEWG).  The  group  comprises \ngovernment  central  agencies  and  key  development  partners.10  The  forum  has  shared \ninformation, discussed impacts of the global economic crisis, and examined possible options to \nmitigate these, including the potential for support to government finances. Government and \ndevelopment partners agreed to the need for a common framework setting out the government\u2019s \npolicy agenda and providing a foundation for technical and budget support. In response, the \ngovernment prepared through the CEWG process a policy matrix that identified key fiscal \nmeasures and structural policy actions. This in turn was based on the incoming policy statement \nmade by the government, which guided formulation of the MTDS 2008\u20132010, supporting sector \nplans, and annual budgets.  \n21.  The  development  partner  members  of  the  CEWG  have  committed  to  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s  policy  matrix.  Development  partners  have  also  committed  to  adopt,  to  the \nmaximum extent practical, a common approach to linking technical and budget support to the \ngovernment-led policy matrix.11 TA is now being oriented to implementing the medium-term \npolicy agenda presented in the matrix (major development partner programs are summarized in \n                                                 \n10 Development partner members are ADB, the Australian Agency for International Development, the European \nUnion, the New Zealand Agency for International Development, RAMSI and the World Bank.  \n11 The Australian Agency for International Development provided A$3 million in financial support to the education \nsector in early 2010 linked to the government policy matrix. The European Union is exploring the provision of \nsubstantial based support by the end of 2010 linked to a government policy matrix. ", "  7\nAppendix 8). Through the CEWG process, development partners have committed to meet \nalmost $10 million of the $25 million budget financing gap estimated by the IMF for 2010. The \nunfilled gap will need to be met by expenditure restraint and/or revenue measures.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n22.  The expected impact of the program is achievement of a higher and more inclusive \neconomic growth path. The expected outcome is initiation of economic recovery while protecting \nthe vulnerable and the fiscal position. The impact and outcome are to be achieved by helping \ninitiate a transition away from dependence on foreign aid and unsustainable logging to private \nsector-led economic growth from the agriculture, fishing, tourism, and mining sectors.  \nB.  Policy Framework \n23.  The  primary  contribution  of  the  ERSP  will  be  in  helping  address  the  underlying \nshortcomings in the economic growth and development process. Importantly, actions will be \nundertaken to strengthen fiscal management. This will help consolidate the fiscal position and \nimprove the operation of government agencies so the government is better able to respond to \nthe economic slowdown and fund priority investments and essential services over the medium \nterm. Structural measures will improve the operation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and \nhelp modernize the regulation of the economy. Extra effort will be taken to make the growth \nprocess more inclusive. Notably, the ERSP  will help deliver essential services by partially \nmeeting the government\u2019s overall budget financing requirements. \n24.  Consistent with the MTDS 2008\u20132010, the ERSP is oriented to achieving private sector-\nled economic growth.12 The environment for private sector development is to be supported at \nboth macroeconomic and microeconomic levels. At the macro level, the private sector will be \nassisted by supporting aggregate demand and lessening fiscal stress. At the micro level, the \nemphasis  will  be  on  helping  reform  of  SOEs  through  efforts  to  support  the  continued \ndevelopment of infrastructure and accumulation of human capital and on reducing the cost of \ndoing business by modernizing the legal framework for business. \n25.  In preparing the program, priority has been given to country ownership and keeping the \nprogram at a level that is manageable given capacity limitations. This is to help ensure the \nsustainability  of  outcomes.  The  formulation,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  the  ERSP \nthrough  the  CEWG  process  is  key  to  achieving  sustainable  results.  The  program  is  also \ndesigned to implement ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy for Solomon Islands, which \npromotes  equitable  private  sector-led  economic  growth  through  improved  transportation \ninfrastructure  and  services  and  a  stronger  business  enabling  environment.13  The  program \ndirectly addresses the guiding priority of ADB\u2019s strategy of promoting good governance.  \n                                                 \n12 The MTDS 2008\u20132010 recognizes that to achieve economic growth and prosperity Solomon Islands needs to \ncreate an environment promoting private sector activity. The strategy seeks to (i) improve the country\u2019s business \nenvironment, (ii) help public enterprises perform better, (iii) encourage public\u2013private partnerships, (iv) strengthen \nthe legal framework for business, and (v) increase opportunities and access to finance.

Interim Country Partnership Strategy: Solomon Islands, 2009\u20132011. Manila. \n ", "8   \nC.  Policy Actions \n26.  Potentially high return and feasible areas of policy action have been identified. These \nare feasible both in political terms and within the public sector\u2019s implementation capacity when \naccompanied by targeted external assistance. The program has four output areas: (i) improved \nfiscal  management,  (ii)  productivity  enhancing  structural  initiatives,  (iii)  support  for  the \nvulnerable, and (iv) communication and ownership of policy actions. The policy actions will be \npursued through two subprograms. Subprograms 1 and 2 support the same four output areas, \nwhich will be progressed concurrently under each subprogram.  \n27.  The policy actions build on a dialogue between the government and ADB and key \ndevelopment partners over a number of years. It includes significant actions by the government \nthat demonstrate a continuing commitment to improved economic and fiscal management. The \npolicy actions provide a package of priority, sequenced reforms in areas critical to achieving \nsustainable, inclusive economic growth. The intention is to continue improvement of economic \nand fiscal management through further action following completion of the ERSP.  \n28.  The ERSP\u2019s policy actions are drawn from the policy matrix prepared through the CEWG \nprocess.14 The link to the government policy matrix ensures the ERSP is aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s own plans and is harmonized with support provided by key development partners. \nThe ongoing dialogue of the CEWG is central to implementing and monitoring the ERSP and to \nsustaining the results achieved under the program.  \n1.  Output (i): Improved Fiscal Management \n29.  The output is directed to achieving the medium-term goals of overall fiscal discipline, \nproviding strategic guidance to PFM reform, ensuring effective expenditure controls are in use, \nraising the efficiency and fairness of the revenue system, and improving the allocation of public \nresources  through  strengthened  budgeting  and  planning  processes.  The  output  will  help \nachieve the short-term fiscal consolidation now urgently required while seeking to maintain the \ncapacity to fund essential services and public investment over the medium term. The output will \nalso help address shortcomings in governance. The emphasis is on initiatives that address the \nweakest areas of PFM identified in a 2008 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability \n(PEFA) assessment.15 \na.  Achieving Overall Fiscal Discipline \n30.  Subprograms 1 and 2 of the ERSP provide for adherence by the 2010 and 2011 budgets \nand the medium-term fiscal framework to the fiscal commitments of the Honiara Club agreement \n(or any updated arrangement put in place with the international community). Under subprogram \n1, the government is committed to keep the ratio of public debt to GDP below 30% and to keep \nthe ratio of payroll charges to GDP in 2010 to no more than the 2009 level.16  \n31.  The  Honiara  Club  agreement  is  a  key  instrument  for  guiding  the  overall  fiscal \nconsolidation. The agreement was reached in 2005 as part of a program of external debt relief. \n                                                 \n14  The formulation of the ERSP has also benefited from diagnostics presented in ADB. 2010. Solomon Islands 2010 \nEconomic Report. Manila (draft); and PEFA Program. 2008. Solomon Islands Public Financial Management-\nPerformance Report. Rotterdam: ECORYS Nederland BV (November, final report). \n15  The PEFA assessment, Solomon Islands\u2019 first, was undertaken to establish a baseline for monitoring progress on \nPFM and to help the government prioritize its reform efforts. The next PEFA assessment is expected in 2011. \n16  The action on public sector wages and salaries allows for some needed expansion in service delivery, notably in \nrelation to the expansion in basic education pursued by the recently adopted \"fee free\" policy. ", "  9\nUnder  the  agreement,  the  government  committed  to  no  further  borrowing  or  sovereign \nguarantees until it reached \u201cgreen light\u201d status under the international debt distress rating \nsystem (which will require, among other measures, that the ratio of public debt to GDP fall \nbelow 30%), as well as to maintaining a fully funded recurrent budget excluding the use of \nborrowing  to  fund  recurrent  expenditure.17  There  has  been  compliance  with  these  fiscal \nprovisions, with the exception of a guarantee of lending provided to two SOEs (Soltai and \nSolomon Airlines) in financial difficulty.18  \n32.  The Medium Term Fiscal Strategy 2008\u25002013 highlighted the fiscal consolidation that \nwould be required as early as 2009 as natural forest resources approached depletion.19 The \n2010 budget updates estimates of the needed fiscal adjustment, estimating that expenditure \ngrowth will need to slow from about 29% in 2008 to 8% per annum by 2014 if budgets are to be \nfully funded over the medium term. A broad-ranging strategy is in place to bring about the \nmedium-term  fiscal  adjustment,  including  actions  to  broaden  the  revenue  base,  rationalize \nspending, strengthen the finances of SOEs, and undertake structural reforms so as to promote \nbroad-based growth. In the period 2011\u20132014, the government expects a slowdown in revenue \ngrowth that will require a substantial reduction in the growth rate of nominal expenditure.  \n33.  Budget for 2010. The budget is based on the government\u2019s updated macroeconomic \nframework in which modest economic growth of 2% is expected in 2010 (slightly below the IMF \nforecast of 2.4%). The government\u2019s growth projection is based on an expected recovery in \nprimary export demand from Asian economies sufficient to offset the effects of declining log \nproduction. With inflation remaining at about 8%, nominal GDP growth of about 10% is forecast \nfor 2010, underpinning a rise of 17.2% over the estimated 2009 level in the government\u2019s tax \nrevenue  collection  (Table  2).  Achieving  the  projected  revenue  collection  will  be  crucial  to \nfinancing the projected 23% rise in recurrent expenditure while ensuring the budget deficit is \ncontained  to  a  level  fundable  from  cash  reserves,  so  that,  in  line  with  the  Honiara  Club \nagreement, there is no new borrowing. \n34.  Expenditure priorities. Care was taken in formulating the 2010 budget to support the \ndelivery of essential services by reinstating cuts to goods and services in 2009. Priority was \ngiven  to  funding  for  education  (notably  for  implementing  the  \u201cfee  free\u201d  policy  for  basic \neducation), health, law and order, the 2010 election (e.g., via funding for the Ministry of Home \nAffairs),  and  supporting  income-earning  activities.  The  government\u2019s  contribution  to  the \ndevelopment budget has also increased substantially. Additional budget support is factored into \nthe 2010 budget, including a grant of SI$40 million (around $5 million) to be provided by  ADB \nand an additional SI$35 million (around $4.5 million) in sector budget support provided by \nAustralia and New Zealand in early 2010.  \n35.  Payroll costs. The 2010 budget was based on a 5% cost of living adjustment to public \nservice pay rates (public service unions had initially sought a 66% increase). A 7.5% pay \nincrease was awarded by the independent trade dispute panel in December 2009, after the \n2010 budget had been tabled in Parliament. This increase is close to the inflation rate forecast \nfor 2010. Taking into account potential savings from tighter controls being placed on payroll \ncosts, MOFT estimate that the 7.5% pay increase will result in total compensation of employees \n                                                 \n17  Government of Solomon Islands, European Commission, European Investment Bank, Government of Australia, \nand International Fund for Agricultural Development. 2005.

This will be a 5.7% increase over the preliminary estimate for \n2009.20 With the 7.5% pay increase, the ratio of payroll costs to GDP will rise to 8.2% in 2010, a \nslight reduction on the preliminary estimate for 2009 of 8.4%. A supplementary appropriation is \nlikely to be required in 2010 to meet the higher than budgeted payroll cost. \n36.  Risk factors. There are a number of key risk factors in the 2010 budget. First, there is a \npotential for overestimating domestic revenue. The implicit elasticity of domestic revenue with \nrespect to nominal GDP growth is at the high end of the plausible range. Funding for investment \nand goods and services is likely to be displaced if the revenue outcome is less than expected. \nSecond, there are specific risks on the expenditure side, including the need to fund as yet \nundetermined increases in entitlements for members of Parliament for 2009 and 2010,21 the \nexpenditure pressures that will arise from the 2010 national election, and ongoing pressure from \nthe large wage and salary bill. Finally, the extent of fiscal restraint required over the medium \nterm has proven difficult to achieve in recent years (Appendix 4). \nTable 2: Summary of Government Accounts \n  SI$million (current prices)    Ratio to GDP (%)\n        2008 2009  2010   2008  2009 2010\n            Act.

A preliminary \nestimate of revenue for 2009 of SI$1,467 million was also released in January, which is higher than the projection \nfor 2009 of $1,420 million provided in the 2010 budget. The slightly better than expected revenue performance in \n2009 gives some reassurance that the small overall budget deficit projected in the 2010 budget can be achieved \ndespite higher than expected payroll costs. \n21  In late 2009, the High Court revoked an increase in entitlements for members of Parliament made for 2009. This \nwas critical to helping avert follow-on claims for extremely large public sector pay increases. The Parliamentary \nEntitlement Commission that is responsible to set entitlements for members of Parliament will need to reconvene to \ndetermine replacement entitlements for 2009 and a new decision on entitlements for 2010. ", "  11\nb.  Providing  Strategic  Guidance  to  Public  Financial  Management \nReform \n37.  Under subprogram 1, the cabinet endorsed a number of measures to provide high-level, \nstrategic guidance to the government\u2019s efforts to improve PFM. These high-level actions are the \ncreation of a multi-agency PFM working group, the preparation of strategies to strengthen \nwhole-of-government  financial  reporting  (including  for  SOEs,  other  entities,  and  third-party \ncontributions) and internal audit, and the creation of an audit committee. Subprogram 2 provides \nfor implementing the strategies to improve whole-of-government financial reporting and internal \naudit. These actions are oriented toward the long-term goal of receiving an unqualified audit \nopinion on the whole-of-government accounts. \n38.  Financial  reporting.  The  legislated  requirement  that  the  government\u2019s  financial \nstatements be prepared within 6 months of year-end is not being met. However, as noted by the \n2008 PEFA assessment, tremendous efforts have been made (with assistance from RAMSI) to \nbring the public accounts up to date. Good progress continues to be made.22 Quality as well as \ntimeliness is being improved. The aim is that the accounts for the year ending 31 December \n2009 will be prepared in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards. \n39.  Audit. The auditor general nonetheless issued a disclaimer of audit opinion on the 2007 \naccounts.23 While recognizing significant improvements in the control environment during 2007, \nthe  auditor  general  noted  continued  failure  in  the  system  for  recording  and  controlling \naccounting transactions, as well as insufficient audit evidence to materially support transactions \nand accounts. Since 2005, the Office of the Auditor General has annually prepared 4-year \nstrategic audit and tactical audit plans. In the latest plan for the period 2008\u25002012, the Office \nproposed to continue the ongoing capacity building and education programs. Legislation has \nalso been drafted to establish a National Audit Office. Since 2006, ministries have also been \nrequired to prepare audit action plans detailing their responses to the various recommendations \nmade by the auditor general. These audit plans are to be advanced under the ERSP. \n40.  Internal audit is essentially limited to a \u201cpolicing\u201d function, with most work undertaken as \nad hoc investigations. The 2008 PEFA assessment found management support for the function \nis limited and the response rate is very poor. The MOFT\u2019s Internal Auditor has prepared a plan \nto develop a more systems-oriented internal audit function that could operate in most ministries, \nand this would be advanced under the ERSP. \nc.  Ensuring Effective Expenditure Controls \n41.  The ERSP will assist the process of fiscal consolidation by strengthening expenditure \ncontrols.  Under  subprogram  1,  upgrades  were  completed  to  the  financial  management \ninformation  and  payroll  systems,  financial  instructions  were  revised  and  submitted  to  the \nattorney  general  for  vetting  (i.e.,  approval),  and  the  cabinet  endorsed  the  preparation  of \nstrategies to modernize supply chain management (procurement) procedures and enhance \ncash  and  asset  management.  Subprogram  2  provides  for  implementing  the  new  financial \ninstructions, cleansing of the payroll data so as to raise the effectiveness of the new payroll \nsystem, and implementing the strategies for procurement and cash and asset management. \n                                                 \n22  The financial statements for fiscal years 1997\u20132003 were completed and audited in 2007; the financial statements \nfor 2004\u20132006 were prepared and audited in 2008; the audit opinion on the 2007 whole-of-government accounts \nwas finalized in February 2009; and whole-of-government financial statements for 2008 were with the Office of the \nAuditor General in late 2009.  \n23 The auditor was unable to express an opinion on whether the annual accounts give a true and fair view of the \nfinancial position of the government. \n ", "12   \n42.  Financial management information system. Accounting and reporting is on a cash \nbasis, with the preparation of consolidated financial statements centralized within MOFT. The \nfinancial management information system (Maximize) had not been supported with updates \nsince 1991. Procurement of a new system was completed over 2009, and work has commenced \non preparing a new chart of accounts. The upgrade of Maximize will reduce system error and \nprovide  a  robust  platform  for  accounting  and  expenditure  reporting.  Complementary \nimprovements in MOFT and training of accountants in line ministries will be needed over the \nmedium term to fully realize the benefits of the upgrades. These improvements are being \nsupported by development partners through TA. \n43.  Payroll. Payroll data for the more than 10,000 central government employees has been \nmaintained centrally by MOFT on the Telepay system that was last upgraded in 1999. The list of \npeople that should be paid (i.e., the nominal roll) and personnel records are maintained by both \nthe individual sector ministries and by the Ministry of Public Service. The Auditor General\u2019s 2006 \nspecial audit on the payroll noted that a regular reconciliation between the three lists does not \ntake place. This remained the case post-audit, as the payroll system did not produce simple \naudit trails. A further limitation is that changing records (e.g., through salary authority forms) has \ntaken up to 3 months.24 A new payroll system (Aurion) was installed during 2009. Initially, only \nthe basic functionalities have been introduced. The next step is to cleanse the data used by the \npayroll system in order to remove \u201cghost\u201d workers and other sources of leakage. \n44.  Financial Instructions. The financial instructions prepared under the Public Finance \nand Audit Act 1978 set out basic rules and regulations for the use of public monies. While there \nhas been a general pattern of improving operation, there are instances where the financial \ninstructions are being waived without due process or simplified procedures are in use (e.g., \npayment of utility bills). New financial instructions were finalized in 2009 to tighten procedures \nand were submitted to the attorney general for vetting (i.e., approval). These are expected to be \nin effect by mid-2010. \n45.  The financial instructions contain procurement regulations, setting out procedures for \npurchase of goods and services. Currently, all expenditures exceeding SI$50,000 are required \nto go out to tender through either ministerial or, for larger tenders, the central tender boards. \nOffice of the Auditor General reports highlight poor compliance with the competitive bidding \nrequirements. The Office of the Auditor General is now including audit of procurement activities \nin its regular audit process. There is no systematic reporting mechanism, however, and tender \nboards (central and ministerial) are not required to issue reports on their proceedings.  \n46.  Cash and asset management. In 2009, the cabinet also endorsed the preparation of \nstrategies to enhance cash and asset management. Progress has been made in developing a \nnew cash flow forecasting model, increasing coordination between debt and cash management, \nmodernizing information technology systems, and establishing a new policy for asset valuation. \nd.  Raising the Efficiency and Fairness of the Revenue System \n47.  The Medium Term Fiscal Strategy 2008\u25002013 outlined the government\u2019s commitment to \nfurther tax reform. Key objectives are to broaden the tax base, shift reliance away from direct \ntaxes, and simplify tax administration for both the government and taxpayers.  \n                                                 \n24  PEFA Program. 2008. Solomon Islands Public Financial Management-Performance Report. Rotterdam: ECORYS \nNederland BV (November). ", "  13\n48.  Subprogram 1 advanced the reform agenda by (i) reducing the leakage of customs \nrevenue  via  gazettal  of  customs  valuation  and  penalties  legislation  and  initiating  a  joint \noperation  between  the  Customs  and  Excise  Division  and  the  Inland  Revenue  Division  to \nimprove collections at the port; (ii) adopting ministerial orders to raise import duties, excises, \nand  fees  on  luxury  goods,  alcohol,  and  tobacco;25  (iii)  cabinet  endorsement  of  a  limit  on \ndiscretionary exemptions to 50% of the total value; and (iv) adopting a process for identifying \nbusinesses outside the tax system, inclusive of a business education initiative. These revenue \nmeasures were forecast to add as much as SI$120 million to revenue in 2009 ($15 million or \n10% of total revenues). Subprogram 2 provides for (i) adopting a cross-government revenue \nmanagement strategy covering legislative and operational reform; (ii) endorsing of the Extractive \nIndustries Transparency Initiative and preparing a new tax regime for the mining industry; and \n(iii) commencing a review of the Customs Act, overseen by a high-level committee. \n49.  Customs  valuations.  The  Customs  and  Excise  Act  has  not  been  revised  for  a \nconsiderable time. The act provide little scope for the customs authority to challenge the values \nthat are notified by the importer, and the current valuation method is not in line with Solomon \nIsland\u2019s obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Solomon Islands is a \nmember of the World Trade Organization). In addition, the act provides an inadequate deterrent \nto  customs  offenses.26  The  Customs  Valuation  Act  passed  in  2009  addresses  these \nweaknesses and the associated significant loss of revenue.27 \n50.  Penalties are prescribed across a wide range of legislation, generally in monetary terms. \nThe ministries responsible for the legislation have generally not updated the levels of penalties \nfor  inflation,  and  these  have  moved  out  of  line  with  current  conditions.28  The  Penalties \nAmendment  Act,  passed  in  2009,  provides  a  mechanism  for  updating  penalties  across \nlegislation with an objective of ensuring a fair, consistent, and just penalty regime. A penalty unit \nsystem has been adopted. This allows the MOFT to advise the Ministry for Justice to increase \nthe value of a penalty unit, automatically increasing the level of penalties in 31 acts. \n51.  Coordination in revenue collection. These legislative reforms are complemented by \nactions to improve coordination across revenue agencies and prepare for a cross-government \nrevenue management strategy. Importantly, the activities of committees of the Inland Revenue \nDivision and the separate customs agency responsible for issuing exemptions are to integrate \nso  as  to  improve  the  administration  of  tax  exemptions.  A  post-clearance  audit  function  is \nproposed, assisted by a new data entry system (PC Trade Link), and stakeholders are to be \ntrained to better understand and comply with the new legislation.  \n52.  Major reviews of the tax system will be initiated under subprogram 2. The main tax laws \nin Solomon Islands were originally enacted in the 1960s. They have been subject to numerous \namendments over the years, but a comprehensive review is yet to be undertaken. Reviews of \nthe Customs and Excise Act and the tax regime for the mining industry will be commenced \n                                                 \n25  A key policy issue is whether more revenue should be raised, as recommended by the IMF, by raising the \ndetermined price of logs used for taxation purposes. The matter warrants close attention in the preparation of \nsubprogram 2. \n26  National Parliament of Solomon Islands Bills and Legislation Committee. 2009. Report on the Customs Valuation \nBill 2009. NP-Paper No. 33/2009. Honiara (August). \n27  Revenue has also been lost in the past through a difference between the international price of logs and the \nadministered value used in setting duties. The MOFT is of the view it has responded to recommendations to close \nthe gap, notably from the IMF, and there is parity between the two values. The issue warrants close monitoring \nthrough the ERSP period. \n28 National  Parliament  of  Solomon  Islands  Bills  and  Legislation  Committee.  2009.

The potential adoption of the international Extractive Industries Transparency \nInitiative will be explored. This initiative aims to ensure openness in the receipt of revenue from \nmining and oil industries.  \n \ne.  Better Budgeting and Planning \n \n53.  Subprogram 1 advanced preparations for multiyear budgeting through (i) procurement of \na new budget system with capacity for forward estimates, and (ii) cabinet endorsement for the \npreparation of a strategy toward adopting multiyear budgeting. Preparation of a replacement for \nthe MTDS 2008\u20132010 also was begun. Subprogram 2 provides for (i) commencing a public \nexpenditure  review,  (ii)  ensuring  the  new  budget  system  will  be  operational  and  ready  to \naccommodate multiyear budgeting and integration of the recurrent and development budgets, \nand (iii) ensuring the new MTDS (or an equivalent plan) is in place. \n54.  Multiyear budgeting. The horizon of the budget estimates is limited to the fiscal year. \nThere  is  no  formal  mechanism  for  medium-term  revenue  forecasting,  although  the \nestablishment of an economic model in 2009 has helped in this regard. These practices weaken \nthe alignment between expenditure decisions with multiyear implications and the availability of \nresources in the medium term. A further consequence is a weak link between capital investment \nand funding for maintenance (particularly donor-funded and central government investments in \nthe  provinces).  A  strategy  of  moving  to  multiyear  budgeting  is  to  be  prepared  and \nimplementation commenced under the ERSP. These actions will be supported by the new \nbudget system adopted in 2009, which provides for multiyear budgeting. As capacity allows, the \nMOFT  intends  to  forecast  out  3\u20134  years  and  to  progressively  integrate  the  recurrent  and \ndevelopment budgets into a unified budget formulation process. \n \n55.  Planning. The current MTDS terminates in 2010. A new MTDS will thus be required \nfrom 2010 following the general election due in the year. The Ministry of Planning and Aid \nCoordination commenced preparation of a new MTDS in 2009, exploring the potential to adopt a \nlonger-term  national  development  framework  to  span  more  than  one  MTDS.  This  will  be \ncomplemented by a public expenditure review to be undertaken with World Bank support.  \n2.  Output (ii): Productivity Enhancing Structural Initiatives \n56.  The output will implement structural initiatives that are ready to implement and could \nprovide quick gains in terms of quickly boosting economic activity. It will also implement those \nreforms needed to achieve a rebuilding of economic growth over the medium term. A key \nconcern is to diversify the economy away from logging and foreign aid and to the alternative \nsources  of  growth:  agriculture  (primarily  palm  oil,  cocoa,  and  copra),  fishing  and  marine \nproducts, mining, and tourism.  \n57.  There  are  four  areas  of  focus  under  this  output:  (i)  SOEs,  so  as  to  improve  their \nefficiency and reduce their drain on the budget, as well as to reduce crowding out of the private \nsector; (ii) deregulation of the telecommunications industry, so as to expand service coverage, \nraise standards, and reduce prices; (iii) the business regulatory environment, so as to directly \nreduce the cost of doing business in Solomon Islands; and (iv) transport infrastructure, in order \nto raise investment levels and service standards while lowering transport operating costs. ", "  15\ni.  Improved Accountability and Performance of SOEs \n58.  Under subprogram 1, SOEs\u2019 accounts for 2007 were updated and audited or submitted \nfor audit, and an SOE monitoring unit was established in the MOFT. Restructuring of SOEs also \ncontinued through (i) commencing commercialization the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority, \n(ii) finalizing the sale of Home Finance Limited, and (iii) continuing the sale of Sasape Marina \nLtd. Subprogram 2 provides for (i) public release of an annual SOE monitoring report, (ii) \nendorsement of a debt restructuring for the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority and new \nappointments to senior positions, (iii) completion of the tender process for sale of Sasape \nMarina, (iv) implementation of a cabinet-endorsed restructuring plan for Solomon Airlines, and \n(v) implementation of SOE regulations on community service obligations and appointment of \ndirectors with a view to further enhancing performance. \n59.  SOE accounts. The government has a majority shareholding in four SOEs, minority \nshares in three companies, and public interests in eight statutory bodies. Many underperform \nbecause  of  inadequate  governance  and  investment,  resulting  in  high-cost  services  of  low \ncoverage and poor reliability. Most of the SOEs and statutory authorities have lacked up-to-date \nfinancial statements. A number are experiencing financial difficulties and in the past have had to \nrequest support from the central government. The shortage of financial information on the status \nof the SOEs thus represents a fiscal risk. Following on from TA provided by ADB, a RAMSI-\nsupported project is progressively updating and auditing the accounts of SOEs. The next step in \ncompleting the 2007 financial statements for the major SOEs was undertaken in 2009, and a \nroving local accountant has been employed to assist with the 2008 financial statements. The \nERSP contains actions to maintain this momentum. \n \n60.  SOE monitoring unit. A reporting and monitoring unit for SOEs is needed within MOFT \nto  report  on  financial  performance  and  to  put  in  place  the  missing  elements  of  the  SOE \nmonitoring regime, such as statements of corporate objectives. Personnel were recruited in \n2009 for the SOE monitoring unit that is now operational. The unit\u2019s mandate is to monitor the \nperformance of SOEs. Public release of an annual monitoring report is to commence in 2010. \n61.  SOE restructuring has continued under the ERSP. In 2009, the privatization of Home \nFinance Limited was completed through a private sale to the National Provident Fund, and \npreparations were underway for privatizing Sasape Marina Ltd through an open, competitive \ntender to be executed in 2010 (both transactions are about $3 million each). The cabinet also \nendorsed commercialization of the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority. The commercialization \nis to be undertaken with World Bank support. It is to involve completing new appointments to \nsenior positions under subprogram 2 and debt restructuring through a debt swap with the \nNational Provident Fund. Little progress has been made, however, in the implementation of a \nrestructuring plan for Solomon Airlines that was approved by the cabinet in 2008.  \n \n62.  SOE regulations. The SOE Act was adopted in 2007, with ADB assistance, to introduce \nan  effective  and  consistent  framework  for  good  governance,  including  to  clarify  roles  and \nresponsibilities of ministers and the board.29 The new act was designed to function alongside \nand  complement  enterprise-specific  legislation  rather  than  to  replace  that  legislation. \n                                                 \n29  ADB. 2005.

Telecommunications Deregulation \n \n63.  The ERSP provides for ending the legislated monopoly on mobile telecommunications. \nUnder subprogram 1, the voluntary relinquishment of the existing operator\u2019s exclusive license \nwas completed and new telecommunications legislation was enacted. Subprogram 2 provides \nfor continuing this process by commencing operations of an independent regulator. Similar \ntelecommunication reforms have had quick and highly beneficial impacts elsewhere in the \nPacific, and these actions hold good prospects for a short-term stimulus to the economy. \n \n64.  Opening  telecommunications  to  competition.  In  1998,  a  15-year  exclusive \ntelecommunication license was awarded to the SOE Solomon Telekom. This was formally \ngranted in November 2003, after lengthy negotiation during the period of civil unrest, when it \nwas perceived that no other operator would wish to provide telecommunication services. As part \nof the agreement, Solomon Telekom was to review in good faith its exclusive rights after a \nperiod  of  5  years.  In  early  2006,  Solomon  Telekom  announced  that  it  would  welcome \ncompetition  subject  to  a  number  of  conditions,  the  most  important  being  that  (i)  new \ntelecommunications legislation would be established and provide a fair and level playing field for \nall participants; (ii) the new legislation would provide for an independent regulator, free from \npolitical interference that Solomon Telekom has perceived as impeding its operations; and (iii) \nthere would be fair and reasonable compensation for the early loss of Solomon Telekom\u2019s \nexclusive rights, coupled with adequate compensation for its obligations to provide services to \nloss-making customers.31 \n65.  Telecommunications Act 2009. Following several years of negotiations, and with TA \nfrom the World Bank, the Telecommunications Act was passed in September 2009. The act \nprovides for a telecommunication commission to regulate competition, and it sets up a system \nwhere  the  service  providers  will  be  able  to  negotiate  amongst  themselves  and  make \ndeterminations for the proper sharing of services or interconnection agreements. A level playing \nfield has been established to facilitate the entry of new private operators. The act provides for a \nstaged introduction of competition. The market for the key mobile telecommunications segment \nis to be open to competition from April 2010. Other aspects of telecommunications are to be \nprogressively opened thereafter. By late 2009, the final compensatory payment had been made \nto Solomon Telekom, a new mobile telephone license had been awarded to an operation linked \nto Papua New Guinea\u2019s B-Mobile, and a new telecommunications regulator was in the process \nof being appointed. \nc.  Lower Costs of Doing Business \n66.  The government is implementing a number of reforms aimed at reducing the costs of \ndoing business and ensuring a level playing field for all businesses. Under subprogram 1, the \nCompanies  Act  2009  and  the  Companies  (Insolvency  and  Receiverships)  Act  2009  were \npassed,  and  the  Secured  Transactions  Act  2008  registry  was  established.  Subprogram  2 \nprovides for establishment of a well-functioning companies registry. These actions have been \n                                                 \n30 Regulations have been drafted, with ADB support, covering directors\u2019 duties, appointment and removal of directors, \ncommunity service obligations, and economic regulatory functions. \n31  National Parliament of Solomon Islands Bills and Legislation Committee. 2009.

", "  17\nundertaken with ADB support in a highly consultative manner that is now providing a model \nprocess for other legislative reform.32  \n67.  Companies law reform. The previous Companies Act was based on the 1948 United \nKingdom Act. It primarily supported large companies and paid little attention to the needs of the \nsmaller  companies  comprising  the  majority  of  firms  operating  in  the  economy.  The  new \nCompanies Act supports a simpler approach that includes a number of innovations, such as the \nintroduction  of  single-shareholder  companies  and  community  companies.  The  innovative \ncommunity companies\u2014a special type of company designed for use by kin groups\u2014enable the \nuse of community assets in a way that benefits all members of the community. Such structures \nalso improve women\u2019s access to credit and encourage their participation in economic activity by \nmaking  it  easier  for  them  to  form  new  companies.  The  new  act  provides  a  modern  and \nappropriate codified statement of directors\u2019 duties and removes the compulsory requirement for \na company secretary. The act has also eliminated unnecessary discretion and removed many of \nthe onerous and unnecessary reporting obligations under the previous act. The act needs to be \nsupported by a new registry to provide greater certainty around transactions as well as greater \nefficiency. The new Companies Act 2009 is complemented by the Companies (Insolvency and \nReceiverships) Act 2009. \n68.  Secured transactions. The Secured Transactions Act 2008 enables banks to better use \nmovable assets as security for loans. The objective is to help more people access the finance \nnecessary to start or improve their business enterprises. This is intended to overcome the often \noverly strict banking requirements in past use related to securable assets and that prevented \nindividuals and small-  and medium-scale businesses from accessing finance. A registry is \nrequired to permit farmers, businesses, and consumers to document the movable property to be \nused as collateral for loans.  \nd.  Efficient and Safe Transport \n69.  Under  subprogram  1,  National  Transport  Fund  Regulations  were  submitted  to  the \nAttorney General for vetting (i.e., approval) to strengthen the funding, payment, and performance \nmonitoring and evaluation mechanisms of the National Transport Fund, and the Maritime Safety \nAdministration  Act  2009  was  gazetted  to  provide  for  operation  of  the  Franchise  Shipping \nScheme.  Subprogram  2  provides  for  (i)  implementation  of  the  National  Transport  Fund \nRegulations, (ii) implementation of an updated National Transport Plan and 3-year rolling work \nprogram, (iii) implementation of the Franchise Shipping Scheme and Solomon Islands Maritime \nSafety  Administration,  and  (iv)  gazettal  of  the  Shipping  (Bareboat  Charter  Registration) \nAmendment Bill. \n70.  The National Transport Fund, established via the National Transport Fund Act 2009, will \nincrease  the  predictability  of  resource  allocation  and  sustainability  of  operations  and \nmaintenance.  It  is  designed  to  provide  a  secure  source  of  funding  for  road,  wharf,  and \nnavigation aids maintenance while ensuring that funds are better used. It is undercapitalized, \nhowever, and managed under temporary arrangements. Regulations are required to formalize \nthe  operation  of  the  fund  (e.g.,  in  relation  to  payment  and  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation mechanisms). These are to be in place in early 2010. Complementary actions will be \nundertaken,  with  ADB  support,  to  build  the  planning,  contracting,  and  asset  management \ncapacity of the implementing agency, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development.  \n                                                 \n32  ADB. 2005.

Due to deferred maintenance, deteriorated rural facilities are hindering \nservice provision and posing safety risks, which problems will be intensified over time by the \neffects of global climate change. There is a need for more robust construction and better \nmaintenance. This in turn requires improved sector planning, funding, and asset management. \nThe 2006 National Transport Plan was prepared to help meet this need. Key objectives of the \nplan  are  integrated  planning,  protection  of  environmental  and  social  sustainability,  and \nincreased resilience in the face of natural disasters. The National Transport Plan provides the \nframework and action plan for developing and maintaining physical infrastructure, facilitating \ntransport  services,  improving  the  capacity  of  government  agencies,  and  enhancing  private \nsector participation. The plan is supported by a 3-year rolling work program. An update of the \n2006  National  Transport  Plan,  prepared  with  ADB  support,  is  to  be  adopted  in  2010  to \naccommodate the latest transport infrastructure condition and socio-environmental conditions.  \n72.  Marine transport. Marine is the main form of transport. In addition to the constraints \nposed by poor physical infrastructure and safety standards, long distances and low demand for \ncargo and passenger services mean that it is not commercially viable for operators to provide \nservices to some remote destinations. Services are often delayed for weeks or months, and \nsometimes cancelled, leaving people and cargo stranded. The Maritime Safety Administration \nAct was passed in 2009 to provide for establishment of the Solomon Islands Maritime Safety \nAdministration to tackle institutional capacity constraints, including lack of strategic direction and \nan incomplete and outdated regulatory environment.33 The act also provides for implementation \nand management of the Franchise Shipping Scheme that will provide subsidies for services to \nremote  communities  using  an  output-based  approach.  The  Shipping  (Bareboat  Charter \nRegistration) Amendment Act is to increase shipping capacity by permitting vessels with foreign \nregistry to be chartered for operation in Solomon Islands. \n3.  Output (iii): Support for the Vulnerable \n73.  The budget support provided under the ERSP will allow a slightly higher level of \ngovernment expenditure than otherwise possible. Additional financial resources provided by \nADB will reduce the national budget\u2019s financing gap and thereby help preserve the delivery of \nbasic  transport  services,  rural  health  services,  and  basic  education.  Limits  on  budgeting \nprocedures and the importance of ensuring simple monitoring necessitate the adoption of high-\nlevel expenditure indicators under subprogram 1.  \n74.  Specifically,  the  government  made  commitments  under  subprogram  1  to  allocate \nadditional funds under the 2010 recurrent budget to goods and services (i.e., nonpayroll costs) \nfor education, health, and infrastructure services. These additional funds (exclusive of sector \nbudget support) are to at least equal the level of the grant provided under the ERSP. The 2010 \nrecurrent budget provided an additional allocation of SI$118 million to goods and services for \neducation,  health,  and  infrastructure  services  that  substantially  exceeds  the  grant  of \napproximately SI$40 million provided under subprogram 1 of the ERSP (Table 3). The potential \nto refine the targeting of funding for basic social services will be pursued under subprogram 2.34 \n                                                 \n33 With the support of ADB. 2007.

Manila (TA 4980-SOL, approved in October, for $2.0 million). \n34  For example, a better targeting of resources would be provided by prioritizing provincial health services funded \nthrough the Ministry of Health, early education and primary school activities funded through the Ministry of \nEducation and Human Resource Development, outsourced repair and maintenance activities funded through the \nMinistry of Infrastructure Development, and the allocation to the National Transport Fund. ", "  19\n75.  In addition to helping maintain expenditure on basic services used by the vulnerable, it is \nproposed that the ERSP be complemented by a regional project: Social Protection of the \nVulnerable in the Pacific. The project is proposed for financing as a grant from the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction (see the discussion in Special Features). The design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1) will track key indicators of impacts on women and the vulnerable. \n4.  Output (iv): Communication and Ownership of Policy Actions \n76.  Under subprogram 1, fiscal information (prepared on a government financial statistics \nbasis) was presented publicly on a monthly basis, and the government publicly released the \nIMF\u2019s Article IV Staff Report 2009. A commitment was also made to release a midyear fiscal \nupdate reporting the status of implementing the 2010 budget and medium-term fiscal strategy. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  a  communications  and  engagement  strategy  will  be  developed  and \nimplemented to explain (i) the government\u2019s response to the global economic crisis, including \nactions to address the needs of the vulnerable; (ii) the state of the public finances and public \nfinancial management reform; and (iii) structural initiatives. Moreover, public release of key \nfiscal information will be expanded to include debt statistics and operation of a MOFT website. \nTable 3: Recurrent Expenditure on Goods and Services \n  SI$ Million    Annual Change in SI$ \n(current prices)  Million (current prices) \nMinistry  2008 2009 2010   2009  2010 \nEducation and Human Resource Development  221  165  238   (56)  73  \nHealth and Medical Services  140  122  162   (18)  40  \nHome Affairs  27  21  56   (6)  35  \nPolice and National Security  48  49  67   1  18  \nProvincial Government and Institutional \n2 \nStrengthening  43  45  62 17  \nCommerce and Tourism  22  17  29   (5)  12  \nInfrastructure Development  46  39  50   (6)  11  \nAgriculture and Livestock Development  9  11  16   2  5  \nOther ministries  244  288  337   44  49  \n  Total  799  756  1,015   (43)  259  \n                   \n( ) = negative. \nNote: Data for 2008 are actual, for 2009 are projected, and for 2010 are budgeted levels.  \nSources: Ministry of Finance and Treasury, Solomon Islands Budget: Budget Strategy, various years; and ADB staff \nestimates. \n \n77.  This output is directed to achieving the government\u2019s medium-term goal of bringing \nabout genuine economic, political, and social partnerships between stakeholders. It builds on \nlessons from ADB experience in implementing program grants calling for attention to developing \nlocal awareness, understanding, and ownership of programs in order to promote their success. \nThe output also draws on findings of the Parliamentary Bills and Legislation Committee, which \nhas reported insufficient consultation with external stakeholders on some legislative reform and \nurged additional effort on consultation.35 \n                                                 \n35 See for example the committee\u2019s reports on the Foreign Investment (Amendment and Validation) Bill 2009, the \nPenalties Miscellaneous Amendment Bill 2009, and the Customs Valuation Bill 2009 (available at the Parliament\u2019s \nwebsite, http://www.parliament.gov.sb/). \n ", "20   \n78.  This  action  will  deepen  the  steps  already  taken  by  the  government  to  broaden \ncommunication and engagement with stakeholders. Key parliamentary committees have been \nrevitalized, notably the Public Accounts Committee and the Bills and Legislation Committee.36 \nFurther, the monthly monetary monitoring meeting (4Ms) remains active. The 4Ms is chaired by \nMOFT and comprises the Central Bank of Solomon Islands, the Office of the Prime Minister and \ncabinet, and the Ministry of Development Planning and Aid Coordination. It meets monthly to \nmonitor the overall situation of government finances as well as the monetary position of the \neconomy.  The  4Ms  has  been  operating  since  the  early  1990s  and  was  a  key  source  of \neconomic and fiscal guidance during the period of civil unrest from the late 1990s.  \n79.  The  government  has  made  efforts  to  engage  with  the  private  sector  through  the \nestablishment of an economic advisory council of Solomon Islands that includes key business \nleaders.  The  communication  and  engagement  strategy  committed  to,  and  subsequently \nimplemented as part of this program, will build on this by involving the council and other key \nstakeholders in the formulation and implementation of the communications strategy.  \nD.  Triggers for Subprogram 2 \n80.  The ERSP is a cluster program of two subprograms. The development policy letter \n(Appendix  2)  sets  out  the  government  policy  agenda.  The  policy  matrix  attached  to  the \ndevelopment  policy  letter  describes  the  policy  actions  of  subprogram  1  and  triggers  for \nsubprogram 2. Indicative monitorable milestones for subprogram 2 are incorporated into the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n81.  The design of subprogram 2 will depend on the outcome of subprogram 1 and the \ngovernment\u2019s emerging priorities. Consideration of subprogram 2 will depend on satisfactory \nprogress  toward  the  policy  triggers  for  subprogram  2  and  reconfirmation  of  the  policy \ncommitment by the government formed following the 2010 national elections. The CEWG will \nplay an important role in assessing these matters. It is expected that subprogram 2 will be \nsubmitted to the ADB Board of Directors for consideration in early 2011 upon completion of key \ntriggers. It should be noted that the expected timeframe for processing subprogram 2 is only \nindicative and, in the event of delay, the timing is not specifically limited. \n82.  While subprogram 2 contains specific policy actions as triggers, the program cluster \napproach provides flexibility to respond to new circumstances. The tranche release conditions \nfor subprogram 2 are not specified at the outset of the ERSP. These will be determined in \nconsultation with the government based on lessons from subprogram 1 and ongoing policy \ndialogue. These tranche release conditions are likely to be in the policy areas set out in the \nsubprogram  2  triggers.  This  approach  will  ensure  the  ERSP  is  synchronized  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s policy agenda and is responsive to current conditions. \n                                                 \n36  The Public Accounts Committee is responsible for the examination of public accounts, Auditor General reports, and \nthe draft annual budget. The committee includes both government and opposition members, and it is chaired by a \nmember of the opposition. The Auditor General acts as secretary. The print and broadcast media are invited to \ncommittee meetings, which are normally televised. The Bills and Legislation Committee reviews all bills presented \nto  Parliament.  The  committees  issue  reports  on  its  findings  with  recommendations  that  are  available  on \nParliament\u2019s website.  ", "  21\nE.  Responding to Lessons \n83.  An  ADB-funded  public  sector  reform  program  was  initiated  in  August  1998.37  The \nprogram aimed at supporting policy reform measures in four main areas: (i) macroeconomic and \nfiscal reforms; (ii) public sector management, including public sector reform, reorientation of the \npublic  sector,  and  movement  toward  performance-based  management;  (iii)  SOE  reform, \nincluding  to  establish  regulatory  frameworks,  corporatization,  and  privatization;  and  (iv) \nstrengthening  governance  institutions  to  improve  accountability  and  transparency.  An  early \nreview of the program concluded that \u201c(p)rogress has been made in difficult circumstances and \nagainst considerable resistance from opponents of reform.\u201d38 However, the civil unrest that \nerupted in mid-1999 ultimately resulted in a new government taking over in mid-2000. The new \nadministration did not support the program objectives and the program ended prematurely. \nDesign of the ERSP has incorporated the lessons from this experience, as well as from ADB\u2019s \nprogram lending elsewhere in the Pacific and in Asia.39  \n84.  Country ownership is pursued by anchoring the ERSP, MTDS 2008\u20132010, and the 2009 \nand 2010 budgets to the government\u2019s policy matrix while aligning actions with that matrix. \nThere is broadly based awareness of the need for action, both in response to the global \neconomic crisis and to address the need to diversify away from logging and foreign aid. The \nERSP builds on this awareness.  \n85.  The cluster approach is adopted to provide the extra time and flexibility needed to build a \ndemand-driven  program.  Notably,  the  finalization  of  subprogram  2  after  the  2010  general \nelection will provide flexibility to align the policy actions with the agenda of any new government. \nThis will also facilitate reassessing the political commitment to the ERSP, which is considered \ncritical given the long-term nature of the policy actions pursued and ADB\u2019s experience with the \n1998 program loan.40 The cluster approach responds to the lesson that program lending has not \nalways been firmly based on an assessment of achievable rates of change and that it has been \ntoo inflexible where rigidity has contributed to program delays. This approach is a key response \nto the need to innovate in weakly performing countries such as Solomon Islands. \n86.  Because the creation of new structures and processes can erode country ownership, the \nuse of existing institutional structures and enhancing existing systems and processes have been \nemphasized. ADB\u2019s participation in the CEWG process is a key enhancement that will be critical \nto sustaining results from the program. \n                                                 \n37 ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors:  Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to Solomon Islands for the Public Sector Reform Program. Manila (Loan 1627-SOL[SF], for $25 \nmillion, approved on 27 August). \n38 ADB. 1999. Reforms in the Pacific: An Assessment of the ADB\u2019s Assistance for Reform Programs in the Pacific. \nManila (p.140). \n39  Key sources of lessons are: ADB. 2009. ADB\u2019s Support for Public Sector Reforms in the Pacific: Enhanced Results \nthrough Ownership, Capacity and Continuity. Manila; ADB. 2001. Special Evaluation Study on Program Lending. \nManila (November); and ADB. 1999. Reforms in the Pacific: An Assessment of the ADB\u2019s Assistance for Reform \nPrograms in the Pacific. Manila. \n40  ADB\u2019s 1999 evaluation of program loans from the 1990s (previous footnote) found that \u201cThe most significant \nsuccess factor of Bank assistance for reforms in the Pacific is also the most obvious: political commitment to and \nownership of the reform program is essential. Externally imposed reform measures (conditionalities) that have little \ngovernment ownership are doomed to certain failure.\u201d(ADB. 1999. Reforms in the Pacific: An Assessment of the \nADB\u2019s Assistance for Reform Programs in the Pacific. Manila. p.#167). The importance of political commitment and \nownership was reiterated in ADB. 2009. ADB\u2019s Support for Public Sector Reforms in the Pacific: Enhanced Results \nthrough Ownership, Capacity and Continuity. Manila. \n ", "22   \n87.  Country ownership and endorsement is facilitated by a relatively simple scope that \navoids the overly complex programs developed for the Pacific in the 1990s. The relatively \nsimple scope is adopted to enhance prospects for sustainable impacts by keeping the program \nrealistic and within the capacity of Solomon Islands. This is a further response to the need to \ninnovate in weakly performing countries. The relatively simple scope has also been adopted to \nfacilitate communication and encourage broad endorsement of the program. \n88.  Program lending evaluations have supported the basic rule that broad participation, in \nparticular from affected groups and sectors, is critical to the success of public policy reform. The \nERSP applies this principle by (i) implementing the government\u2019s policy agenda; (ii) drawing on \nthe diagnostic work of the latest Pacific Island Economic Report for Solomon Islands, which \nitself builds on findings from extensive consultation (including with community groups); and (iii) \nincluding as one of four output areas actions to provide for public communication and ownership \nof economic and fiscal management initiatives. \nF.  Special Features \n89.  The CEWG process established by the government is an innovative program feature. \nThe process has been critical to formulating a single government-led policy matrix that all \ndevelopment partner members support and to helping meet the budget financing gap arising \nfrom the economic slowdown. \n90.  The ERSP pays special attention to the needs of the vulnerable. The program contains \nactions to help maintain expenditure on key basic services used by the vulnerable. In addition, it \nis proposed that the program be complemented by a regional project: Social Protection of the \nVulnerable in the Pacific. The project is proposed for financing as a grant from the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction, with a proposed allocation for Solomon Islands of $2.5 million. The \nproposed regional project will provide (i) a short-term response to the vulnerable (a block grant \nto  selected  communities  for  health-related  activities  to  improve  food  security  and  health \noutcomes for the vulnerable, especially pregnant women and infants); (ii) a pilot social safety \nnet program (an innovate community social insurance scheme with skills development training \ntargeting  vulnerable  women  as  primary  participants);  (iii)  capacity  development  of \nnongovernment  organizations  and  civil  society;  and  (iv)  regional  dialogue,  knowledge \ndissemination, and project management. \nG.  Financing Plan \n91.  It  is  proposed  that  a  cluster  of  grants  totaling  $10.00  million,  comprising  two \nsubprograms  of  $5.00  million  each,  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian  Development  Fund \nresources  subject  to  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  grant  agreement.  The \nremaining cost to the budget of the actions included in the policy matrix will be met by the \ngovernment of Solomon Islands. \n92.  Grant size has been determined after due consideration for (i) the estimated impact of \nthe global economic crisis; (ii) the national budget\u2019s overall projected financing requirement, \nwhich is estimated by the IMF at $25.00 million annually in 2010 and 2011; (iii) the shortfall in \nfinancing available from other development partners; (iv) the significance and complexity of the \nERSP policy actions; and (v) the ERSP\u2019s conformity with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership \nstrategy  (2009\u20132011). Grant  size also  recognizes  (i)  the  contribution  that  will be  made  to \nprotecting important social expenditure; and (ii) the government\u2019s demonstrated commitment to ", "  23\nimplement a policy agenda, as evidenced by policy actions achieved over 2009 and efforts \nundertaken to promote effective government\u2013development partner dialogue through the CEWG. \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n93.  Program management. MOFT will be the executing and implementing agency and will \noversee policy, legal, and regulatory actions while ensuring that the policy actions as agreed by \nthe government and ADB are carried out duly and on time. MOFT will also be responsible for \noverall  implementation  of  the  program,  including  to  carry  out  all  policy  actions,  program \nadministration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program records. The CEWG will be the \nprogram coordinating committee and shall hold a special meeting on the program at least \nquarterly to monitor progress and provide guidance to the MOFT. The committee may invite \nother government agencies to contribute as needed. Consideration will be given to transferring \nthe program coordinating committee role to the 4Ms in the later stages of the ERSP. \n94.  Implementation period. The program cluster period will be from 1 March 2009 to 28 \nFebruary 2012. This is the period in which the policy actions agreed with the government and \nset out in the policy matrix were formulated and will be put into place. Subprogram 1 will be \nimplemented from 1 March 2009 to 28 February 2010, with monitoring continuing through 2010 \nand 2011 as necessary. \n95.  Procurement  and  disbursement.  The  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  to \nSolomon Islands as the recipient according to ADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures and \nrelated requirements for program loans.41 The proceeds will be used to finance items produced \nand procured in ADB member countries, while items in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 9) \nand imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources are excluded. Grant proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value \nof the total imports of Solomon Islands, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible \nimports, and imports financed under other official development assistance, is at least equal to \nthe amount of the grant to be disbursed during a particular year. \n96.  The grant proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs. Supporting \nimport documentation will not be required if during each year that grant proceeds are expected \nto be disbursed the value of Solomon Islands imports minus imports from nonmember countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to \nor greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during that year. The government will \ncertify its compliance with this formula with the withdrawal request. \n97.  In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  compliance  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  international  commodity  markets  will  be \nprocured according to procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. Before \nwithdrawal, the government will open or nominate a deposit account with the Central Bank of \nSolomon Islands to receive the grant proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and \nliquidated according to terms satisfactory to ADB. Subprogram 1 will provide for retroactive \nfinancing for eligible expenditures incurred by the government up to 180 days before grant \n                                                 \n41 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "24   \neffectiveness. ADB will have the right to audit use of the grant proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n98.  Tranches. The program will be provided as a cluster grant comprising two subprograms \neach of a single tranche. A single tranche grant of $5.00 million is to be disbursed under \nsubprogram 1 when the government has met the conditions for effectiveness. Subprogram 2, a \nsingle tranche grant of $5.00 million, will be presented for consideration and approval by the \nBoard based on the progress achieved in implementing subprogram 1, including the status of \ncompliance with the proposed policy actions and readiness of the government to continue the \npolicy agenda. Subprogram 2 is expected to be considered by the Board about 12 months after \nsubprogram 1 grant effectiveness. \n99.  Counterpart funds. Local currency generated from the proceeds of the grants will be \nused to support public expenditure objectives under the program. \n100.  Program performance monitoring and evaluation. MOFT will (i) within 3 months of \ngrant effectiveness, establish and maintain a performance evaluation system for the program \nthat will be derived from the design and monitoring framework, policy letter, and policy matrix; \nand (ii) monitor and report to ADB, on a biannual basis over the term of the program, the \nimplementation of policy actions and their impact on budget outcomes, in line with the program \nimpact and outcome indicators agreed upon with the government. As the program\u2019s outcomes \nand impacts will be most clearly felt beyond the period of its implementation, MOFT will continue \nto  monitor  these.  Monitoring  of  outcomes  and  impacts  will  make  maximum  use  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s own processes and other mechanisms, including the CEWG, so as to ensure it is \nnot an onerous requirement. \n101.  Program review. In cooperation with MOFT and the CEWG, ADB will carry out periodic \nreviews  of progress  implementation  and  assess  the  impact  of  the ERSP.  ADB\u2019s  Solomon \nIslands resident coordinator, colocated with the World Bank, will be central to ADB\u2019s contribution \nto continuing policy dialogue through the CEWG.  \n102.  The government will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other \nmultilateral and bilateral agencies having implications for ERSP implementation, and it will \nprovide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  ADB,  in \ncollaboration with MOFT and key multilateral and bilateral agencies via the CEWG, will review \nprogram  performance  about  6  months  after  grant  effectiveness  regarding  the  outcome  of \nsubprogram 1 and before beginning preparation of subprogram 2. This review will evaluate \nimplementation of the policy reform measures under subprogram 1, assess the impact, describe \nlessons identified during the program period, and outline policy actions and any assistance \nneeded for sustained economic recovery and to enable processing of subprogram 2. Program \nreviews and the subprogram 2 design will draw on dialogue with stakeholders from the private \nsector and civil society, such as the economic advisory council established by the Office of the \nPrime Minister and the Solomon Islands Chamber of Commerce. \n103.  The government and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators \nto monitor the ERSP implementation and evaluate its impact within the overall ERSP design \nand monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n104.  A program completion report will be prepared for each subprogram, with an overall \nreport to be prepared within 1 year following the end of the program for the purposes of \nevaluating its overall success. The government will maintain its monitoring and evaluation of the ", "  25\nprogram at least until completion of the program completion report. ADB will also conduct a \npost-program review to assess ongoing progress against the medium-term indicators of the \ndesign and monitoring framework and the medium-term program direction of the policy matrix. \n 105.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and MOFT. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nprogram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in the grant regulations and bidding documents for the program. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the program shall include provisions specifying \nADB\u2019s right to audit and examine the records and accounts of MOFT and all contractors, \nsuppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  program.  These \nmeasures  will  complement  the  actions  underway  to  improve  financial  accountability  and \nanticorruption  measures,  which  are  being  put  in  place  with  the  assistance  of  RAMSI  and \ndevelopment partners. Key actions relate to strengthening of financial reporting and audit, \nrevising  payroll  and  financial  management  systems,  and  refining  financial  instructions  and \nprocurement practices (as incorporated in output (i): improved fiscal management). \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n106.  The TA on Pacific Economic Management is supporting economic monitoring, analysis, \nand policy advice in Pacific developing member countries, including Solomon Islands.42 The TA \nsupports the strengthening of economic monitoring systems and uses this information to provide \nhigher-quality  economic  advice.  The  TA  is  focused  on  assisting  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of country-specific actions in response to the global economic crisis. The scope \nof assistance extends to revitalization of economic management systems, including support for \nthe implementation of communication and awareness raising initiatives and the formulation and \nimplementation of budget and structural reform actions. \n107.  Under the TA on Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, ADB is supporting Pacific \ndeveloping member countries, including Solomon Islands, in the coordination of private sector \nreforms;  analysis  of  private  sector  development-related  issues  and  projects;  reform  of  the \ncompanies, company registry, and bankruptcy legislation; secured transactions initiatives; and \nactions to improve governance and restructuring of the SOE sector.43 Support is also being \nconsidered for review of the Customs and Excise Act while building on ADB\u2019s experience with \nthe reform of business legislation. \n108.  ADB  is  the  lead  development  partner  in  supporting  improvements  to  the  transport \nnetwork (land, sea, and air). ADB TA has supported investment in the sector by developing \ncapacity in the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development. In 2008, a multiyear TA project \nstarted to support continuing development of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development as \na planning, contracting, and asset management agency through a technical support program.44 \nThis includes long-term support to the Transport Policy and Planning Unit to implement the \n                                                 \n42 ADB. 2009.

TA has also assisted developments in the maritime sector, notably the \npreparation  of  new  legislation  and  establishment  of  the  Shipping  Franchise  Scheme \n(Supplementary Appendix A). In addition, the new capacity will be utilized under a transport \nsector development project to be developed by project preparatory TA to improve sustainable \naccessibility via improved land, sea, and air transport throughout the nation and a sector-based \napproach to improve the effectiveness of donor contributions to the transport sector. \n109.  Recognizing the lead role undertaken by RAMSI and the Government of Australia to \ndirectly support PFM, and the support from the IMF\u2019s Pacific Financial Technical Assistance \nCentre (Appendix 8), ADB has not focused on this area in Solomon Islands.45 Support is, \nhowever, provided on a regional basis to the Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions of \nwhich the Solomon Islands Audit Office is a member.46 Through that association, the Solomon \nIslands Audit Office is participating in the activities of the Pacific Regional Audit Initiative. The \ninitiative assists regional cooperation and coordination among Pacific audit agencies so as to \nbuild and sustain public auditing capacity. In addition, ADB is supporting the development of \ninternal audit in the Pacific in conjunction with the IMF\u2019s Pacific Financial Technical Assistance \nCentre, initially in three pilot countries.47 While the government is not included as one of the \ninitial pilots, MOFT has expressed interest in the TA and ADB will consider extending support to \nthe Internal Audit Unit within MOFT later in 2010. \n110.  ADB\u2019s Solomon Islands resident coordinator (as funded under TA 6475-REG), colocated \nwith the World Bank, provides overall support to ADB\u2019s TA in Solomon Islands.  \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n111.  Economic. The program will help address the impact of the global economic crisis that \nhas brought forward an adjustment expected  as natural forests approach exhaustion. The \ngovernment  needs  to  counter  these  developments  by  improving  economic  and  fiscal \nmanagement. The program provides the fiscal resources to a collaborative development partner \neffort to assist Solomon Islands make the adjustment to the new economic environment. \n112.  Social. The program will help the government limit any short-run increase in poverty \nincidence arising from the economic slowdown. This is primarily to be assured by providing the \nfinancial resources needed for the government to protect funding for basic transport, education, \nand health expenditures, and thereby helping ensure the delivery of essential services to the \nvulnerable. No negative social impacts are expected. The program will not affect indigenous \npeoples. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n113.  Environmental. No adverse environmental impacts are anticipated from this program. \nNo  environmental  assessment  is  necessary  for  the  program  to  be  implemented.  An \nenvironmental analysis is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n                                                 \n45  ADB supports the operation of the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre through ADB. 2008.

Risks \n115.  Key risks are that (i) political instability weakens fiscal discipline and policy commitment, \nparticularly  in  the  lead-up  to  the  2010  election;48  (ii)  there  will  be  insufficient  capacity  in \ngovernment to implement the program; (iii) the revenue position of the government deteriorates \nand impedes service delivery; and (iv) excessive growth in expenditure will crowd out essential \nexpenditure, making it difficult to achieve and capitalize on the policy actions of the program \n(e.g., because of a large increase in entitlements for members of Parliament and/or a large \npublic sector wage increase). \n116.  Program design elements mitigate these risks. The first risk is to be minimized by \noperating  the  program  over  two  parliamentary  terms.  This  will  enable  the  government\u2019s \ncommitment to be reevaluated after the 2010 election as part of the subprogram 2 formulation, \nand, as necessary, for the ERSP to be tailored to new circumstances. A communications and \nengagement strategy is also incorporated into the ERSP in an effort to encourage broad-based \ncommunity and political support for the program\u2019s policy actions.  \n117.  TA  will  be  provided  on  a  selective  basis  to  supplement  the  expertise  needed  to \nimplement key policy actions. It is nonetheless recognized that although there is commitment to \ncontinuing implementation of the policy agenda, technical and managerial resources are in short \nsupply. There is thus a risk that insufficient skilled staff will be retained or recruited by the line \nministries and public enterprises to ensure the sustainability of policy actions.  \n118.  The risk of shortcomings on the fiscal side will be lessened through an explicit focus in \nthe ERSP on fiscal discipline. TA on economic and fiscal management will also be available to \nhelp improve budget formulation and implementation.  \n119.  Importantly, the ERSP also relies on (i) an improvement in the global economy; (ii) a \npositive response by the private sector to improved economic conditions; (iii) a commitment of \ngovernment agencies to improve performance; (iv) the provision of complementary financial and \ntechnical  resources  by  development  partners;  and  (v)  the  continued  operation  of  key \ncoordinating mechanisms, notably the 4Ms and the CEWG. \n120.  Overall, the potential benefits from reducing the impact of the global economic crisis and \nproviding improved basic services with supporting structural and governance initiatives are \nconsidered to outweigh the risks. Indeed, the cost of inaction could be high, particularly if social \ntensions are increased by weak economic conditions and problems in the delivery of basic \nservices by the public sector. \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n121.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n                                                 \n48  A key consideration is that although local ownership of the PFM reform agenda is evident, the risk of slippage has \nbeen identified as high (PEFA Program. 2008. Solomon Islands Public Financial Management-Performance \nReport. Rotterdam: ECORYS Nederland BV [November, pp.73\u201374]). \n ", "28   \n(i)  The government will (a) ensure that the policies already adopted and actions \nalready taken as described in the development policy letter, including the policy \nmatrix,  continue  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the  program  period  and \nsubsequently; and (b) promptly adopt all other policies and take all other actions \nindicated in the development policy letter, including the policy matrix, and ensure \nthat such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the program \nperiod and subsequently. \n(ii)  The  government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral or bilateral aid partners that have implications for implementation of \nthe  program,  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  progress  made  in  carrying  out  the \npolicies and actions set out in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, \nand  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy \nproposals. The government will continue policy dialogue with ADB on problems \nand  constraints  encountered  during  implementation  of  the  program  and  on \ndesirable changes to overcome or mitigate such problems and constraints. \n(iii)  Throughout the implementation of the program, the government will ensure that \nadequate resources are allocated and released in a timely manner in order to \nensure proper implementation of the ERSP as described in the development \npolicy letter.  \n(iv)  The government will undertake necessary measures to create and sustain a \ncorruption-free environment; ensure that its anticorruption law and regulations \nand ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are strictly enforced and complied with during \nthe  program  implementation;  and  facilitate  ADB  to  exercise  its  right  to \ninvestigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the program.  \n(v)  The government will ensure that: (a) within 3 months of grant effectiveness, a \nperformance  evaluation  system,  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  established  and \nmaintained; and (b) MOFT monitors and reports to ADB, biannually over the term \nof the program, the implementation of policy actions and their impact on budget \noutcomes  and  public  enterprise  performance  (including  financial  and \nperformance  indicators),  as  aligned  with  the  program  impact  and  outcome \nindicators agreed upon with the government. \n(vi)  The government will ensure that: (a) its monitoring and evaluation of the program \nremains in effect for at least 1 year after completion of the program, and (b) \nwithin 1 year of program completion, it will prepare a program completion report \nfor the purposes of evaluating the program\u2019s overall success. \n \nB.

Key Economic Issues \n1.  The well-being of the vast majority of the population has improved little in the years since \npolitical independence in 1978, despite the rapid depletion of a major resource: the natural \nforest.1 Real per capita gross domestic product (GDP) has changed little, as the high population \ngrowth rate (2.9% per annum during 1980\u20132009) almost kept pace with the moderate long-run \nrate of economic growth (3.4% per annum during 1980\u20132009). This has left the Solomon \nIslands population of over 500,000 with the second-lowest average income in the region. \n \n2.  Formal sector job creation has not kept pace with the increase in the labor supply, and \nthe open unemployment rate rose to 11% in 1999. It is reported that in recent years only one in \nevery six school-leavers has found paid employment and that the youth unemployment rate is \n45%. Many of those who have not found formal sector jobs have become underemployed in the \nsubsistence sector, where women\u2019s work has so far managed to feed the growing population. \nHowever, population pressure on arable land has become evident in some areas: in Malaita, \n\u201csteep slopes or hilly non-arable land are increasingly being cultivated.\u201d2 \n \n3.  Like other small island states, Solomon Islands is disadvantaged by (i) remoteness from \nmajor  world  markets,  (ii)  the  difficulty  of  achieving  adequate  economies  of  scale  in  the \nproduction of goods and provision of public services, and (iii) risks due to a narrow economic \nbase and vulnerability to natural disasters. Natural shocks have included cyclones Namu in \n1986 and Nina in 1993, as well as a tsunami in April 2007. Economic shocks have ranged from \ncommodity price declines to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and, more recently, rising oil and \nfood prices and the global economic crisis. \n \n4.  As noted by the governor of the Central Bank of Solomon Islands, however, the poor \npost-independence development performance largely is attributable to \u201cself-inflicted injuries or \nthings  which  the  country  could  have  avoided  by  prompt  action.\u201d3  These  have  included \nsuccumbing to the danger of dominant foreign investors exercising undue political influence, \nthereby undermining domestic governance and introducing corruption.4 \n \n5.  The  legislative  and  executive  arms  of  government  have  failed  in  several  respects. \nNotably, public sector management (revenue administration, public expenditure management \nand public administration, including policy development and coordination) has been weak. A \nlack of fiscal discipline during a period of export-led growth in the late 1980s and into the 1990s \ndrove the economy into crisis by 1995, leaving it with an unsustainable public debt burden. \nSimultaneously, under-taxation and under-invoicing of log exports caused a loss of revenue \nduring 1990\u20131997 that was more than double the cumulative recurrent budget deficit during this \nperiod. The failure to capture a reasonable domestic share of the resource rent from logging the \nnatural forest has continued into the 21st century. \n                                                 \n1  The sector diagnostics presented in this appendix draw heavily on ADB. 2010.

Further, the decade to 1997 \u201cwas a period when public sector institutions and principles \nof  good  governance  were  systematically  undermined  while  the  economic  and  social \ninfrastructure was left to deteriorate.\u201d5 The foundation of a good governance environment\u2014\ncharacterized by a skilled, motivated, and efficient civil service\u2014was eroded, with a consequent \ndeterioration  in  the  quality  of  service  delivery  that  remains  evident.  A  2004  Transparency \nInternational report concluded that \u201cthe public service has become corrupt\u201d and that \u201c(p)olitical \ninterference  in  administrative  matters  within  the  public  service  has\u2026escalated  since \nindependence to the point where it is unremarkable.\u201d6 \n7.  Successive governments failed to establish an effective forest resource management \nregime despite considerable technical advice over two decades. New forest legislation has been \nin the pipeline for years and remains there. Meanwhile, the forest continues to be exploited as if \nit were a nonrenewable resource. This outcome is closely associated with corruption in the \nexecutive arm of government, which \u201cis the one institution most deeply compromised with \nrespect to integrity, ethics and even lawfulness\u201d (footnote 6).  \n8.  Governments  failed  to  provide  a  transparent,  predictable  regulatory  framework  that \nprotects the public interest while encouraging private sector development through minimizing \nthe transaction costs of doing business. An inefficient state-owned enterprise sector has added \nto the difficulties of doing business, most notably by providing expensive and unreliable power, \nwater, and telecommunications.  \n \nB.  Economic Prospects \n9.  Economic growth prospects rest on developments in mining, agriculture, fishing, and, to \na lesser extent, tourism. A large gold mine closed during the civil unrest is near to reopening, \nand there is potential to develop large nickel deposits. While mining projects would boost GDP, \nthe sector would employ few people and there would be long lags before the projects boosted \ngovernment revenue. The best prospects for job creations and growth in government revenue \nlie in large-scale palm oil developments, in fishing (there is already one large cannery), in \nmarine products, and in the smallholder tree crops of cocoa and copra. The supply of fruit and \nvegetables to the urban centers as a substitute for imports also offers good prospects, as does \nthe fledgling tourism industry. \n \n10.  A  number  of  recent  studies  have  examined  the  economic  growth  prospects  under \nvarious scenarios and assumptions. The studies have identified the potential for economic \ngrowth after logging, albeit at only low to moderate rates that would see at best slow growth in \nreal GDP per capita. The studies have also highlighted the necessity of concerted government \naction to realize the potential growth and the downside risk of inaction. \n \n1.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Solomon Islands 2010 Economic Report7 \n11.  The Asian Development Bank report examined a business-as-usual scenario, being a \nsituation without policy and without structural or forced adjustment. The scenario assumed (i) \nforestry output began a demand-induced decline in 2009, falling by 30% in the year and then \ndeclining at 5%\u201310% per annum thereafter; (ii) Gold Ridge Mining Limited does not commence \n                                                 \n5  Central Bank of Solomon Islands. 2008.

The report concluded that \nunder these scenarios the economy could grow by almost 3% per annum from 2010 to 2013. \nGiven the high population growth rate, however, there would be no growth in real per capita \nGDP. This projection highlights the importance of mining operations to lift the economy once \nlogging declines.  \n \n2.  World Bank\u2019s Solomon Islands Sources of Growth8 \n12.  In its report, a World Bank and International Finance Corporation team assessed the \npotential impact of certain major projects and sector initiatives. Impacts on economic growth, \nemployment, the balance of payments, and government revenue over the period to 2013 were \nexamined while assuming that the global economy might grow only slowly and commodity \nprices would remain weak. The projections examined prospects in six sectors identified as the \npotential  economic  drivers  of  the  economy:  mining,  fishery,  plantation  forestry,  tourism, \nplantation agriculture, and palm oil plantations.  \n \n13.  Prospects were found to rest heavily on global economic conditions and the success of \nthe  government  to  conclude  agreements  with  project  sponsors.  A  number  of  outstanding \ndisputes were identified that could hold up projects. Regulatory reform was identified as having \nthe potential to allow major projects to proceed quickly while also sending positive signals to \nother prospective investors, particularly in the mining, tuna fisheries, palm oil, and tourism \nindustries. \n \n14.  A \u201cfavorable case\u201d scenario was prepared that assumed the government and investors \nsuccessfully addressed growth constraints and led to prompt establishment of major projects \nand sector initiatives. Under this scenario, it was found that (i) almost SI$2 billion (around $250 \nmillion) could be added to annual exports by 2013; (ii) government revenues could rise by about \n3%  of  GDP  per  year  (roughly  the  amount  of  the  government\u2019s  annual  contribution  to  the \ndevelopment expenditure); and (iii) growth in the six sectors could potentially create about 7,000 \nnew jobs. The main sources of new employment were identified in the palm oil and agricultural \nplantation sectors. \n \n3.  Government\u2019s  Solomon  Islands  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development \nStrategy9  \n15.  The government\u2019s report examined the potential for the economy to build on its non-\nmining natural resource base: food crops and fresh fruit, coconut, cocoa, timber, fish and marine \nproducts, oil palm, plus livestock in the past. The best prospects were found to lie with the \nconsolidation  and  diversification  of  existing  marketing  chains  that  relied  on  smallholder \nproduction, such as food crops and fruit, coconuts, and cocoa. It was concluded that the \nalternative rural activities\u2014livestock, tourism development, and forest plantation development\u2014\nwould take more time to develop. \n \n16.  A \u201cgrowth scenario\u201d concluded that a trend growth rate of GDP of 5.3% was a realistic \npossibility for the coming decade, assuming that the key constraints were addressed. These \nconstraints included (i) remoteness of the islands, which results in high transportation cost and \n                                                 \n8  World Bank. 2009.

It  was  concluded  that  growth  would  rely  upon  the  development  of  oil  palm  in \nGuadalcanal and, to a lesser extent, upon the continued growth of food and fresh produce \nproduction and marketing, forest plantations, cocoa, and development of the fishing sector. \n \n4.  International Monetary Fund 2009 Article IV Report10 \n18.  The International Monetary Fund 2009 Article IV Report documents a weakening of \neconomic performance in 2009, with negligible growth in GDP as the global recession and \ndepleting  forestry  reserves  adversely  affected  export  earnings.  The  fiscal  situation  has \ndeteriorated as declining revenue and weak spending controls have led to cash shortages and \nforced the government to adopt several expenditure-cutting measures. The Article IV report \npresents a medium-term baseline macroeconomic scenario for 2010\u20132014 in which growth is \nexpected to remain below trend over the next few years. For 2010, growth of 2.5% is projected \nas conditions among Asian trading partners improve, palm oil and copra production increase, \nand new foreign direct investment occurs in mining and telecommunications. However, decline in \nlogging is expected to act as a drag on income and employment, fiscal revenues, and export \nreceipts. Growth of 2.8% is forecast in 2011 before the anticipated commencement of large-\nscale gold production leads to a growth acceleration in 2012. Under the baseline scenario, the \ncurrent account deficit widens in 2010 and foreign reserves come under increasing pressure in \n2010\u20132011.  \n \n19.  The Article IV report concludes that large and potentially destabilizing macroeconomic \nimbalances  could  emerge  in  2010\u20132011,  necessitating  sizable  policy  adjustment  and  new \nexceptional financing. A budget financing gap equivalent to 4% of GDP a year (around $25 \nmillion in 2009) and an external financing gap of around $25 million a year are identified.  \n \nC.  Policy Priorities \n20.  To achieve sustained, diversified, and more socially inclusive economic growth, the \ngovernment must ease the identified growth constraints by vigorously fulfilling its core roles, \nnamely, to maintain macroeconomic stability and provide public goods and services, including \nan adequate economic infrastructure and legal framework for economic activity. \n21.  Ensuring fiscal sustainability is central to a stable macroeconomic environment and \ninvolves  maintaining  overall  fiscal  discipline,  improving  strategic  resource  allocation  and \nmobilization, and strengthening revenue administration and expenditure management. Public \nfinancial management reforms aimed at achieving these objectives need to be sequenced over \nthe long term, as indicated in the government\u2019s public financial management reform agenda \n(Appendix 5).  \n22.  In  a  remote  and  geographically  dispersed  island  nation,  transport  infrastructure \ndevelopment is essential to national and rural economic growth and basic services delivery. \nSuch infrastructure development has been limited, and there is a need to raise investment \nlevels, improve service standards and maintenance, and reduce transport costs. The poor \ncondition  of  many  roads  lowers  travel  speeds,  increases  fuel  consumption,  raises  vehicle \noperating costs, and reduces the economic lives of the vehicles. In particular, the condition of \n                                                 \n10  International Monetary Fund. 2009. Solomon Islands: 2009 Article IV Consultation\u2014Staff Report. Washington, DC. \n ", "Appendix 3  45\nthe rural road network does not provide much accessibility to markets and public services. \nShipping services have deteriorated because of the economic downturn and the number of \nusable wharves has decreased because of poor maintenance. International and domestic air \nservices and facilities also require upgrading. Effective implementation of the National Transport \nPlan  2007\u20132016  and  its  supporting  3-year  rolling  work  programs  is  needed  to  achieve  a \nsustainable, higher rate of transport infrastructure development (Supplementary Appendix A). \n23.  There also is a need to improve utilities services in respect of coverage, reliability, and \ncost.  The  introduction  of  competition  into  telecommunications  in  2010  is  a  welcome \ndevelopment, and this should be complemented by improving performance of the Solomon \nIslands Electricity Authority and Water Authority through such means as commercialization and \noutsourcing  management  under  performance-based  contracts.  In  general,  reform  of  state-\nowned enterprises is required to improve their efficiency and quality of service delivery, to \nreduce  their  drain  on  the  budget,  and  to  reduce  crowding  out  of  the  private  sector.  The \ngovernment should seek to divest itself of commercial activities as far as possible, leaving them \nto  the  private  sector.  The  privatization  of  Sasape  Marina  and  Home  Finance  Limited  are \nexamples. To improve the provision of international and domestic air services, the government \nalso needs to commit to implementing a restructuring plan for Solomon Airlines.  \n24.  To attract the investment necessary for faster economic growth, the investment climate \nand  business  regulatory  environment  need  improvement.  Efforts  by  the  major  producer  to \nexpand palm oil production and introduce coconut oil processing should be encouraged, as \nshould reopening of the Gold Ridge gold mine, private investment in tuna canning, and other \npotentially viable projects. This encouragement generally should be provided not by special \nincentives  but  by  adherence  to  a  clear  medium-  to  long-term  investment  policy  and  by \nadministrative simplicity, transparency, and equity and consistency in the treatment of investors. \nThe legal framework provided by the Foreign Direct Investment Act 2005 should be made fully \noperational.  \n25.  The government has recognized that the high cost of doing business in Solomon Islands \nconstitutes a major impediment to private sector-led growth. It has initiated a far-reaching reform \nof laws governing commercial activity to make it easier to open and operate businesses and to \nimprove access to credit. A Secured Transactions Act, new Companies Act, Insolvency and \nCompanies Receivership Act and a new Trustees Act have all been recently passed. The \nlegislation now needs to be implemented in a timely manner. The regulatory framework could be \nstrengthened further through reforming the business licensing system within the context of \nplanned taxation reform and updating labor legislation. Access to credit should improve with the \nfull implementation of the Secured Transactions Act, but greater access to financial services \nrequires providing services in rural areas. This will be best achieved through the development of \nrural banking. Land tenure reform is a high priority, albeit a complex and long-term issue. \nCurrent government initiatives to facilitate the registration and predictable, sustainable leasing of \nland need to be pursued.  \n \n ", "46   Appendix 4 \nFISCAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  The Overall Fiscal Stance \n1.  Coming off the low base of the period of civil conflict, the government\u2019s domestically \nraised, or \u201clocal,\u201d revenue grew strongly in 2003\u20132008, averaging 19% per year real growth.1 \nThe overall expansion in local revenue collections has resulted from rapid growth in nominal \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP),  improvements  in  tax  compliance,  and  reductions  in  tax \nexemptions through the operation of a goods tax exemption committee in 2007\u20132008. The \ngovernments of Australia and New Zealand have provided budget support to the health and \neducation sectors, respectively, since 2005; Taipei,China has provided recurrent budget support \nfor national debt servicing; and donors have provided a fairly steady level of on-budget grant \nfunding for development spending. Total revenue and grants managed through the government \nfinancial system in 2009 were budgeted at over three times the 2003 level.  \n2.  Growth in recurrent expenditure kept pace with local revenue growth in 2003\u20132008 and \nwas budgeted to rise by 9% in 2009, primarily reflecting a provision for fully funding established \npublic service positions. The public service wage bill barely increased in 2002\u20132004, but there \nwere large jumps in 2005 (34%), in 2007 (42%), and again in 2008, when a supplementary \nbudget was introduced partly to cover a wage rise granted in May. The share of the wage bill in \nrecurrent expenditure reached 31% in 2008 and would be almost 36% for 2009 if all public \nservice  positions  were  filled.  Expenditure  on  goods  and  services  rose  relatively  rapidly \nthroughout the period in response to the need to restore and improve public service delivery. \nDevelopment expenditure had been entirely donor funded until government funding began in \n2006, and in 2009 it will be about three times the 2003 level. \n3.  The government was able to run budget surpluses from 2003 to 2007, although these \nsurpluses masked strong growth in expenditure that was offset by high revenue collections. The \noverall budget surplus has declined since 2004. This reflects a substantial rise in government-\nfunded development spending and recurrent budget surpluses that were lower than expected, a \nresult of spending on payroll and other charges that was higher than expected. \n \n4.  Until  recently,  strong  revenue  growth  allowed  for  very  large  increases  in  fiscal \nexpenditure  (approximately  20%  per  year  in  real  terms)  that  remained  within  the  revenue \nenvelope while the government refrained from any new borrowing under the Honiara Club \nagreement.2  However,  overoptimism  that  favorable  external  conditions  would  continue  to \nsupport economic growth and generate windfall revenues contributed to excessive expenditure \nand  fiscal  slippages  in  2009.  This  has  left  government  finances  vulnerable  to  the  current \ndownturn and made medium-term adjustment to the decline in logging more challenging. \n \n5.  The government has previously committed to a Medium Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS) \n2008\u25002013,  but  this  has  not  been  updated.  Although  the  MTFS  recognizes  the  need  to \nundertake structural reforms and to deliver an affordable and sustainable budget, this has \nproved difficult in practice. The MTFS calls for expenditure growth to be constrained from \naround 22% per annum in 2007 to 0.4% per annum in 2012 to prevent a budget deficit and \n                                                 \n1  The sector diagnostics presented in this appendix draw heavily on ADB. 2010. Solomon Islands 2010 Economic \nReport. Manila (draft). \n2  The Honiara Club is a multilateral forum convened by the government in October 2005 to seek debt relief from its \nofficial creditors, including Australia and the European Commission. The final agreement resulted in a moratorium \non principal repayments and forgiveness of interest payments during the moratorium period. It also led to debt \nforgiveness from external creditors (equivalent to 1% of GDP). In return, the government pledged to restrict official \nborrowing. \n ", "  Appendix 4  47\nprovide sufficient funding for the development budget. The MTFS is not explicitly linked to the \nobjectives of the Medium Term Development Strategy.   \n \nB.  Quality of the Revenue System \n6.  Log export duties continue to provide a significant percentage of tax revenue (directly \nand indirectly logging is estimated to have contributed around 15% of tax revenue), though most \nof the benefits of logging over the years have gone to foreigners as a result of duty exemptions \nand under-reporting of log volumes and values. The determined value of logs for tax purposes \nalways has been well below the international price. While there was an increase in the value in \nMay  2008,  a  second  planned  rise  did  not  eventuate.  A  2007  Auditor  General\u2019s  report \nsummarizing 10 special audit reports covering 2001\u20132004 noted that \u201csignificant\u201d export duty on \nlogs  had  been  lost  and  royalty  payments  had  not  been  fully  captured.3  The  International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) reports:  \n \nThe delayed adjustment in reference prices of logs to reflect market values has \nresulted in lost tax revenues, estimated at about 3.0% of GDP in 2006 and 3.75% \nof GDP in 2007. Rough estimates show that foregone revenues would be as high \nas 10% of GDP in 2008 [about SI$365 million].4 \n \n7.  The 2007 auditor general\u2019s report also noted that there were major shortfalls in collection \nof fishing license fees. It conservatively estimated that SI$433 million had been lost in foregone \nrevenue and corruptly or fraudulently disbursed public monies. In 2008, customs revenue lost \nthrough  relatively  casual  and  nontransparent  duty  exemptions  and  weak  compliance  was \nthought to be significant. \n8.  Unlike the Treasury Division, which deals mainly with matters within the public sector, \nthe Inland Revenue Division must deal with the public at large. It operates in an unpromising \nenvironment. Taxation is an alien concept to Solomon Islanders. The traditional concept of \nreciprocity for a service provided or favor given does not extend to government services and the \ntaxation  system.  Many  expatriate  businesses  are  believed  to  evade  tax  at  any  cost.  A \nconservative estimate is that there is 30% tax compliance in Solomon Islands (the figure relates \nto the number of taxable entities, not the value of revenue involved). One area of leakage is \nthrough ministers and the customs service having power to grant exemptions, which they do \nwithout necessarily following due processes. The Inland Revenue Division has recently made \nchanges to the environment in which exemptions are granted. The intentions are for the scrutiny \nof the Duties Exemption Committee to be free of conflicts of interest, to make it more difficult for \nthe customs service to make contrary decisions about duties, and to make ministerial decisions \noverriding the advice of the committee to be transparent.  \n9.  The Inland Revenue Division is strategically placed, and, given the needed technical \nsupport and commitment at policy level, it should in theory be able to take on the issue of self-\nserving  business  interests.  Business  interests  have  access  to  the  best  financial  and  legal \nadvice. In contrast, the Inland Revenue Division has 10% of its workforce in full-time positions, \nmany people in acting positions for 3 years and more, and numerous staff vacancies. It also \nworks under a 1965 Taxation Act that has had no substantive update, has weak local capacity \nin complex audits and investigations other than that provided by expatriates, and has no legal \ncapacity to prosecute a case.  \n                                                 \n3  Office of the Auditor General. 2007.

Investigating major tax evaders and corrupters should be a priority because it sends a \nstrong  message  about  propriety  to  the  population  at  large  and  significantly  raises  the \ngovernment\u2019s  capacity  to  raise  revenue.  This  capacity  would  be  further  enhanced  by  a \nstrengthening of the Customs and Excise Division. Updating the 1963 Customs Act would be \nkey to success. \nC.  Quality of Public Expenditure \n11.  The Solomon Islands Medium Term Development Strategy (MTDS) 2008\u20132010 accords \na high priority for infrastructure development and private sector-led growth. The government has \npronounced its intentions to align the budget formulation and implementation process to the \nMTDS priorities, especially in terms of delivering essential services and policy reform. However, \nbreakdowns in fiscal discipline and poor expenditure choices have resulted in the current cash-\nconstrained fiscal position and led to underfunding of such priority development activities as \ninfrastructure and service delivery. The realignment of expenditures toward these priorities has \nbeen  slow  and  will  need  to  be  hastened  if  stated  objectives  such  as  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  are  to  be  achieved.  There  also  have  been  incidences  where \nimplementation  of  policies  and  programs  was  inconsistent  with  the  strategy.  A  strong \ncommitment to the MTDS as an important driver of budgetary processes needs to be reinforced \nin order to ensure that budget allocations adequately reflect the stated expenditure priorities.  \n12.  The monitoring and evaluation of budget allocations and expenditure are important in \ndetermining the extent to which the MTDS is driving the budgetary process. This would reveal \nthe effectiveness of the overall public expenditure management system and help to highlight \nissues that may require corrective action. Such a monitoring process would also provide a \nvehicle for compiling the data and information required for a comprehensive evaluation of the \ndevelopment strategies that will improve future development planning. There is, however, only \nvery limited tracking of the extent to which public expenditures map to MTDS priorities. \n13.  A number of funds operate outside the purview of the budget. They include special \npurpose funds like the Civil Aviation Special Fund, the National Disaster Fund and a Disaster \nRelief  Special  Fund,  the  establishment  of  which  the  auditor  general  considered  not  in \naccordance with the requirements of the Constitution and governing legislation. His audit report \nfound a large number of anomalies in the last named-fund: for example, large payments to \nmembers of Parliament to apply to disaster relief without the government requiring the members \nof Parliament to provide any details as to how these funds were spent.5 \n14.  There  are  also  funds  which  are  funneled  through  politicians  to  finance  small-scale \ndevelopment in their electorates. Three such funds are provided by Taipei,China: the Rural \nConstituency Development Fund, the Millennium Constituency Development Fund, and the \nConstituency Micro-Project Fund. A working paper prepared for the Constitutional Congress \nadvised that these funds provide SI$1 million for each politician to distribute as he or she thinks \nfit in his or her constituency.6 There appear to be very relaxed requirements for parliamentarians \nto account for their disbursements.  \n15.

Strengthening of cabinet fiscal policy processes should be part of this \napproach.  \n16.  In addition, the Solomon Islands do not have a medium-term expenditure framework at a \nnational  or  sector  levels.  There  have  been  moves  toward  developing  a  medium-term \nexpenditure framework in the health and education sectors, but these will have little impact on \nthe budget preparation process at a political level in the absence of an overarching national-\nlevel framework. \n17.  The government wage bill is perhaps the most important area of expenditure pressure. \nHigh government wage bills have two dimensions: the number of persons employed and pay \nrates.  As  documented  in  Sugden  and  Taniguchi,  these  dimensions  are  negatively  related \ninternationally, with relatively high pay rates typically associated with relatively small public \nservices.  This  relationship  is  pronounced  in  Solomon  Islands,  where  pay  rates  for  public \nservants are\u2014relative to what the economy can afford\u2014among the highest internationally. The \npublic service, as a share of total employment, is also among the smallest internationally, a \nreflection of the high unit cost of employing public servants.8  \n18.  The  payroll  is  not  reconciled  with  members  of  Parliament\u2019s  records  of  actual  staff \nemployed. There is a belief that staff numbers are swollen by ghost workers. The development \nof an integrated human resource management information system with links to a financial \ninformation system in the Ministry of Finance and Treasury is very much needed.  \nD.  Debt sustainability \n18.  The level of official public debt has dropped from its 2004 peak, and it continued to fall in \n2007 as a result of major debt relief from the Government of Australia in October of that year, \nthe clearing of domestic debt arrears, and recommencement of debt repayments to some \nexternal creditors. At the end of November 2009, the stock of official debt stood at SI$1,473 \nmillion, or 25.6% of GDP, inclusive of SI$27.0 million in arrears on external debt that constituted \nthree-quarters of the total debt stock. The 2009 budget provided for a reduction in the allocation \nof government revenue to debt servicing from 15% to 10%, on the basis that the government\u2019s \ndebt burden was considered to be manageable. The 2010 budget allocates the equivalent of \n7.2% of government revenue to debt servicing. However, the debt burden, though reduced, still \nleaves the economy in a vulnerable position, and especially given the medium-term decline in \nlogging and uncertainty over the start-up of gold mining. As noted by the IMF, Solomon Islands \nremains  at  moderate  risk  of  debt  distress,  and  medium-  to  long-term  debt  sustainability \ncontinues to depend on developing new sources of export earnings to replace logging.9 .  \n                                                 \n7  World Bank. 1998.

Institutional Setting \n \n1.  After just 30 years of political independence, nationhood remains a fragile concept.1 \nSolomon Islands has a Westminster government, but parliamentarians enter Parliament with a \ndifferent view of parliament and government compared with their counterparts in similar, well \nfunctioning institutions overseas. Their local political experience is one in which leadership is \noften a function of wealth and the ability to use that wealth to reinforce or raise one\u2019s local \npolitical standing through the wantok system of kinship and allegiance.2 In Parliament, it is to \nthat support base that the successful candidate\u2019s focus is often confined and to the detriment of \nmore  broadly  representing  a  constituency  or  working  toward  the  good  of  the  nation.  The \ndevelopment and entrenchment of a sense of nationhood in the realm of Solomon Islands \npolitics  is  therefore  seen  as  an  important  key  to  sustainable  improvement  in  government \nperformance. \n \n2.  The first-past-the-post electoral system operates in small electorates where there is no \nrestriction on the number of candidates. A candidate can gain election with a minority of votes \nbased  predominantly  on  kin-based  support.  The  electoral  system  thus  produces  a  \u201chighly \nunstable mixture of weak parties and independent parliamentarians, who then negotiate the \ncreation of coalition governments that divide the political spoils between them\u201d.3 To address this \ninherent instability, a Political Parties Integrity Bill has been prepared that aims to give a newly \nelected  government  some  breathing  space  from  politicians  who,  having  initially  professed \nsupport for a leader, might choose to cross the floor. \n \nB.  Public Financial Management \n \n1.  Legislative and Policy Framework \n \n3.  The Constitution sets out the foundations for public financial management in Solomon \nIslands.  This  includes  the  presentation  of  estimates  before  Parliament,  operation  of  the \nConsolidated Fund, establishment of other funds, and imposition of taxation. It also establishes \nthe Office of the Auditor General as a public office and sets out the auditor general\u2019s mandate \nand independence.  \n \n4.  The 1978 Public Finance and Audit Act and its associated financial instructions (updated \nto 2005) regulate, among other things, (i) the powers and duties of the minister of finance; (ii) \nthe powers and duties of the permanent secretary (finance) and accountant general; (iii) the \nduties and responsibilities of the accounting officers; (iv) government borrowing; (v) procedures \nfor procurement and payments from the funds; (vi) procedures for collection and receipt of \nrevenue; (vii) procedures for advances, imprest accounts, deposits, and suspense accounts; \n(viii) the custody of public money; and (ix) the custody and control of other assets.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The sector diagnostics presented in this appendix draw heavily on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability \nProgram.  2008.  Solomon  Islands  Public  Financial  Management-Performance  Report.  Rotterdam:  ECORYS \nNederland BV (November, final report).  \n2  Under the wantok system, those that speak the same language (or share \u201cone talk\u201d) traditionally look out for one \nanother. The wantok system could be seen as an unwritten social contract between those speaking the same \nlanguage to assist each other in times of need.  \n3  Background discussion is provided in F. Fukuyama. 2008. State-Building in Solomon Islands. Pacific Economic \nBulletin. 23(3). Canberra: Australian National University. \n ", "52   Appendix 5 \n5.  The legislature\u2019s Public Accounts Committee is responsible for the examination of public \naccounts, the auditor general reports, and the draft estimates. With the Auditor General as its \nsecretary,  it  has  had  the  necessary  sittings  to  meet  its  responsibilities.  Nevertheless,  the \ntimetables of the executive are such that it has not always had sufficient time to carry out its \nresponsibilities in a satisfactory manner. It is not unusual for it to have insufficient time to review \nthe annual appropriation bill and report to Parliament in order to influence the debate.  \n \n2.  Agency Arrangements and Capacity \n \n6.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  prepares  the  budget  while  the  Ministry  of \nDevelopment Planning and Aid Coordination prepares development budgets separately. There \nis  little  coordination  between  the  two.  Considerable  capacity  development  and  capacity \nsupplementation has been provided to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury under the Regional \nAssistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) economic governance program. While this has \nsignificantly raised the capacity in targeted areas, major gaps still remain in such other areas as \nnational accounts compilation in the National Statistics Office, cash flow forecasting in the \nTreasury, and enforcement in the Department of Customs and Excise. \n \n7.  There  is  a  lack  of  capacity  within  the  Ministry  of  Development  Planning  and  Aid \nCoordination to implement and monitor the entire development budget effectively. As a result, \nthere has been significant underspending of the planned development budget in past years. \n \n8.  The  RAMSI  intervention  is  a  key  source  of  support  for  capacity  development  in \ngovernment agencies. Having begun as a response to the failure of the state, it is now operating \ntoward the broader aims of supporting law and justice, the machinery of government, and \neconomic governance.  \n \n9.  RAMSI  support  for  the  machinery  of  government  has  three  principal  objectives: \naccountable  government,  efficient  and  effective  government,  and  responsive  government. \nThese could be collapsed into the single objective of efficient and effective government, since \nsuch government is both accountable and responsive, but the separate specification of an \naccountable government highlights the importance of improving government behavior, which \nhas been a major focus of RAMSI initiatives. Pursuit of this objective also involves outside \ncommercial interests, which exercise considerable influence on government, seeking to divert it \nfrom  the  national  interest.  A  Public  Service  Improvement  Program  has  recently  been \nestablished as one of the key interventions under the machinery of government program. \n \n3.  Budget Formulation  \n \n10.  The alignment of public expenditure with national development priorities, as outlined in \nthe  government\u2019s  medium  term  development  strategy,  is  being  strengthened  by  strategic \nallocation of public resources through the annual recurrent and development budgets. The \ngovernment appropriates on an annual cash basis to each ministry. The appropriation is also \nspecified in a detailed breakdown of inputs for two major categories of recurrent expenditure: (i) \npayroll, and (ii) other charges for each cost center within a ministry. The basis for appropriation \nis under review. The budget is formulated in consultation with spending ministries. From 2007, \ninterdepartmental consultation has started an early stage in the budget preparation process. \nThe budget classification system has also been strengthened. \n \n11.  Multiyear budgeting is not in use, even though attempts have been made to incorporate \nsuch elements into the budget process. The horizon of the budget estimates is limited to the \n ", "  Appendix 5  53\nfiscal year even though an attempt has been made to forecast for 2 years following the budget \nyear. Efforts are underway to establish a systematic approach to revenue forecasting, and to \nreplace a past practice of only incrementing the previous year\u2019s outcomes. \n \n12.  Of the order of two-thirds of the total funds expended on government-approved projects \nare provided by donors. These funds are controlled jointly by donors and the government, with \nthe extent of government control being dependent on the donor. In addition, a proportion of \ngovernment funds are set aside to be disbursed by individual members of Parliament. \n \n4.  Budget Execution \n \n13.  Spending agencies are normally provided with a full year\u2019s allocation. Because annual \ncash flow forecasts are not prepared, however, it is difficult for the government to plan the use \nof its cash effectively.  \n \n14.  The current financial management information system (Maximise) has built-in nonpayroll \nexpenditure commitment controls. The controls check that there are sufficient funds left in the \nbudget before a commitment can be made. This control is only partially effective, as it can be \noverridden. It also does not cover all expenditure, e.g., utility payments, as these do not require \na local purchase order to be raised. Revised financial instructions are needed to ensure that \nprudent financial management standards are in place and practiced. Payroll controls are limited \nby the fact that reconciliation between the nominal roll (maintained by the Ministry of Public \nService, sector ministries, or education authorities), personnel records, and the actual payroll \ndoes not take place. These two issues are to be addressed by the new financial management \ninformation system and payroll system. \n \n5.  Budget Accounting and Reporting \n \n15.  The major bank account is reconciled daily, while other bank accounts are reconciled \nmonthly. A monthly reconciliation process for other records is in place and has commenced. \nGovernment reports on the recurrent budget in a timely fashion (usually providing quarterly \nfiscal  outlook  statements),  including  to  the  public  via  newspapers.  Budget  expenditure  is \nmonitored monthly. The accuracy of the data depends on inputs from ministries but is regarded \nas reasonably accurate. The Ministry of Planning and Aid Coordination has taken measures to \nimprove the planning and coordination of development aid, but these efforts have largely been \nineffective. Reporting on the development budget remains weak, and this is to be addressed in \nthe context of developing an integrated budget. \n \n6.  External Audit and Oversight \n \n16.  Prior to the advent of the RAMSI program to strengthen and reform Solomon Islands \naccountability institutions, public accounts were not prepared in a timely fashion and the Office \nof the Auditor General had effectively ceased to function as an audit institution. With RAMSI \nsupport, the Office of the Auditor General has been working toward addressing the audits \nbacklog for government accounts. Audits of the 1998\u20132003 national accounts were concluded in \n2007 after 8 years of delays.  \n \n17.  The government, with the support of RAMSI, engaged KPMG Australia to update nine \nstate-owned enterprise (SOE) accounts and audit them. In total, 49 years of accounts were \nupdated and audited dating from as far back as 1997; the 2006 and 2007 accounts were \nprepared to International Financial Reporting Standards. This work also highlighted deficiencies \n ", "54   Appendix 5 \nin  accounting  capacity  and  financial  systems.  To  ensure  that  momentum  in  accounts \npreparation continues, the government, with RAMSI support, has engaged a roving accountant \nto assist the SOEs in preparing for audit of their 2008 accounts and potentially their 2009 \naccounts. The government is also looking to work with donors to develop another program of \nassistance  for  the  SOEs,  with  a  focus  on  strengthening  accounting capacity  and  financial \nsystems, improving corporate governance, and improving government monitoring of the SOEs. \n \nC.  Procurement \n \n18.  Procurement regulations are contained in the 1994 financial instructions (updated to \n2005). This sets out the procedures for the purchase of goods and services. Currently, all \nexpenditure greater than SI$50,000 is required to go out to tender. Ministerial tender boards \nprocess contracts of between SI$50,000 and SI$500,000, while the Central Tender Board \nprocesses  larger  contracts.  Public  contracting  is  done  by  the  Central  Tender  Board  and \nindividual ministry tender boards. The Central Tender Board within the Ministry of Finance and \nTreasury deals with contracts of more than SI$500,000 and each ministerial tender board deals \nwith contracts valued at less than SI$500,000. It is of particular concern that the capacity of the \nCentral Tender Board is less than that of individual ministry tender boards. \n \n19.  The Office of the Auditor General reports highlight the fact that there has been poor \ncompliance with the competitive bidding requirements set out in the financial instructions and \nthat there are a significant number of instances whereby financial instructions are being waived \nwithout due process and simplified procedures are being adopted. The Office of the Auditor \nGeneral is now including audit of procurement activities in its regular audit process; but there is \nno systematic reporting mechanism that can provide accurate data on use of open competition. \nWhile the financial instructions require the use of open competition for all purchases above \nSI$50,000,  there  is  no  requirement  for  reports  to  be  produced  justifying  the  use  of  less-\ncompetitive methods. Tender boards (central and ministerial) are not required to issue reports \non their proceedings, there is no public disclosure of contracts awarded, and there is no specific \nprocurement complaints mechanism. Bidders can complain to the Ombudsman\u2019s Office, but the \nombudsman can only make recommendations. \n \nD.  Corruption \n1.  Legislative and Policy Framework \n20.  Corruption is officially recognized as an offense in two ways. Part X of the Penal Code \nidentifies very broad definitions of bribery (S.91), extortion (S.92), false declaration (S.95), \nabuse of office (S.96), and false assumption of authority (S.98) when stipulating offenses to be \nrecognized as official corruption. Public officers so prosecuted face criminal proceedings and \npenalties  if  convicted  of  a  felony  warranting  imprisonment  for  up  to  7  years.  The  1999 \namendment of the Leadership Code Act (The Leadership Code (Further Provisions) Act 1999) \nenables prosecution of cases on the charge of \u201cofficial misconduct,\u201d which is defined as: \u201cthe \nuse of office for personal benefit; neglect of official business; bribery; the acceptance of loans; \nthe non-reporting of business interests; and even ownership of property which could not be \nexpected to be attainable through known income or receipts.\u201d \n2.  Integrity Institutions and Systems \n21.  The  Leadership  Code  Commission  has  insufficient  resources  to  meet  its  workload. \nCurrently, the commission has a staff of four investigating officers and a director of legal \nservices  to  prosecute  offenders.  The  actual  powers  of  the  commission  to  investigate  and \n ", "  Appendix 5  55\nprosecute are not completely clear. For example, the Leadership Code Commission considers \nthat it cannot act until it receives a formal complaint. Transparency International, however, \nconsiders that the 1999 Act provides the commission with \u201csignificant scope for direct action\u201d \nand  does  not  require  a  complaint  to  be  made  in  order  to  initiate  an  investigation.  On \nprosecutions,  the  act  is  quite  clear  that  proceedings  for  misconduct  in  office  shall  be \ncommenced in the High Court. There remains an issue about whether disciplinary issues are \nwithin the jurisdiction of the High Court, which considers it can only hear criminal and civil \ncases. Partly as a consequence of this uncertainty, the Leadership Code Commission is loathe \nto hear corruption complaints, which it believes are criminal matters and consequently should be \ninvestigated by the police. It has not yet, however, referred any such cases to the police. \n3.  Rule of Law \n22.  Solomon Islands ranked in the 0\u201325th percentile (24%) for \u201crule of law\u201d in the World \nBank  governance  indicators  in  2008.  The  country\u2019s  rating  was  the  lowest  among  Pacific \ndeveloping member countries, with the exception of Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste. \n4.  Administrative Quality \n23.  The government acknowledges the poor quality of public administration. Administrative \nstructures  are  fragmented,  business  processes  largely  ineffective  or  not  followed,  and \nresponsibilities  frequently  overlap  between  and  within  ministries.  This  often  results  in \nunnecessary delays and transaction costs for the government and, ultimately, inefficient service \ndelivery. The issue is being addressed in part by donor programs in a number of individual \nministries, by operationalization of the Institute of Public Administration and Management, and \nby a whole-of-government approach to financial management being developed by the ministries \nof finance and public service in conjunction with RAMSI. Progress is being made, albeit slowly. \nThe World Bank\u2019s 2008 government effectiveness indicators rank Solomon Islands regionally at \na low 21%. \n \n24.  Recruitment  and  promotion  are  formally  merit-based,  but  patronage  is  extensively \npracticed in several parts of the government. Bribe seeking is accepted in parts of government \nand the probity of public servants is threatened by opportunities for corrupt practice. The public \nservice has been politicized. The Public Service Commission is nominally independent, but it \nhas been poorly resourced. \n5.  Voice and Accountability \n25.  The Audit Office is gradually working through a large backlog of work. Checks and \nbalances on executive powers are patchy. Public officials are typically not held accountable for \nfailures. Reports on corruption throughout the public service persist. The Ombudsman and \nLeadership Code commissions established to inquire into the conduct of public servants and \nofficers of public agencies have been under-resourced and largely ineffective. Nevertheless, \naccountability institutions have been strengthened with RAMSI support. Solomon Islands was \nranked at 54% in 2008 for the \u201cvoice and accountability\u201d indicator (World Bank Governance \nIndicators 2008). \n6.  Public Perceptions \n26.  Surveys suggest that the perception since 2005 is that corruption is on the rise, which is \nalso of concern given the number of governance-oriented projects that are being implemented \nin the country. In the People\u2019s Survey 2008, on the question of dishonest behavior or misuse of \npower among senior people in the community, 81% considered there was misbehavior, while \n ", "56   Appendix 5 \n14% considered there was not. The figure had increased considerably over 2007, when 54% of \nrespondents considered that there was such behavior. \n ", "  Appendix 6  57\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS \nA.  Poverty Situation \n \n1.  Approximately  85%  of  the  estimated  533,671  people  living  in  Solomon  Islands  are \nlocated in rural areas. The country is experiencing rapid population growth, at a rate of around \n2.8% annually. This has resulted in a youthful population structure, with around 40% of the \ncountry\u2019s population below the age of 15.1 \n \n2.  During the years of conflict between 1999 and 2003, the country\u2019s economy collapsed \nand the delivery of many basic services was disrupted, resulting in a significant increase in \npoverty. Although progress has been made with substantial external assistance in restoring \nmany basic services, levels of coverage and quality are generally inadequate outside of urban \nareas. \n \n3.  With its estimated gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $1,870 in 2009 (current \nprices),  Solomon  Islands  has  the  second-lowest  average  income  in  the  region.2  Income \ndistribution is unequal, both personally and geographically, with levels in rural areas significantly \nbelow those in urban areas. Similarly, social indicators in Solomon Islands, although improving, \nare  amongst  the  worst  in  the  region,  falling  short  of  the  targets  set  for  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. They are particularly poor in rural areas (Table A6). Gains made have \nbeen  underpinned  by  substantial  external  financial  and  technical  assistance.

According to the most recent census, in 1999 only 46% of the total labor force, or 17% of \nthe working population, was employed in the formal sector. In addition, two-thirds of all formal \nsector workers were male. Most formal sector employment opportunities are concentrated in \nHoniara. A large proportion of Honiara\u2019s population is employed in the informal sector, however, \nworking as providers of domestic services or pursuing small business activities. \n \n5.  More than 80% of the population relies on subsistence or semi-subsistence agriculture \nand fishing. Small-scale income-generating activities include the sale of copra, cocoa, fruits, \nvegetables, and marine products. However, opportunities to earn cash income to meet nonfood \nbasic needs in rural areas are constrained by a lack of reliable transport and limited marketing \narrangements. This has resulted in growing rural\u2013urban migration. In 2008, 48% of households \nsurveyed  across  the  country  reported  having  a  family  member  working  elsewhere  in  the \ncountry.4 \n \n6.  Young people have been identified as a disadvantaged group, as job creation has not \nkept pace with the increase in the labor supply. In 1999, the open unemployment rate rose to \n11%. It is reported that in recent years only one in every six school-leavers has found paid \nemployment, and that the youth unemployment rate is 45%.5 \n \n7.  A study by the Solomon Islands Statistics Office and the United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP) in 2008, which analyzed data from the 2005/06 national household income \nand expenditure survey, estimated that approximately 11% of the population was living below \nthe food poverty line, while almost one-third of the population lived below the basic-needs \npoverty line.6 Interestingly, the study found that while food poverty was greatest in rural areas \n(8.7% of the population compared with 2.3% in Honiara), nonfood poverty was highest in \nHoniara (32.2% compared with 18.8% in rural areas).  \n \n8.  A  2009  analysis  of  the  household  income  and  expenditure  survey  data  by  Narsey \nsuggests, however, that the methodology and calculations in the Solomon Islands Statistics \nOffice/UNDP study are flawed and in fact the incidence of basic needs poverty is significantly \nhigher in rural areas compared with provincial urban areas and Honiara.7 There are large \ndifferences in poverty between provinces, with Malaita accounting for over one-third of all rural \npeople living in poverty, followed by Makira-Ulawa (14%\u201317%) and Guadalcanal (11%\u201313%). \n \nC.

As Table A6 demonstrates, \nhuman development indices remain low for Solomon Islands, with notable variation between \nprovinces. While the human development index is highest in Honiara and the Western Province, \nit is lowest in Guadalcanal and Malaita.8  \n \n1.  Education  \n \n10.  In rural areas, long distances and poor transport systems play a role in limiting access to \neducation. Also, there are not enough schools in Solomon Islands for every child to receive \neducation for 10 years. Existing facilities are often inadequate, being in poor physical condition \nand lacking essential equipment. The recent abolishment of primary and junior secondary school \nfees has resulted in increased enrollment rates, which have put further pressure on existing \nschool facilities as the number of classrooms and teachers has largely remained unchanged. \n \n11.  According to the 2008 People\u2019s Survey, Honiara had the best access to primary school \nfacilities with 72% of households reporting having a primary school located in their community \ncompared with only 16% in Malaita and Renbel. In addition, 30% of households in Malaita and \n50% in Guadalcanal reported that accessing a primary school required a travel time ranging from \nat least an hour to half a day, compared with only 1.8% of households in Honiara.9 \n \n12.  The national primary enrollment rate in 2005 was estimated to be 94% (of which 53% \nwere boys and 47% girls).10 However, there are marked regional disparities between provinces. \nFor example, Honiara has the highest primary and secondary school net attendance rates \n(72.1% and 47.1%, respectively) compared with other provinces, mostly notably Malaita with \nprimary and secondary net attendance rates of 58% and 20%.11 \n \n13.  After the age of 13, attendance rates for all children, particularly girls, begins to decline \nas a result of social barriers that prevent girls from seeking further education, the shortage of \nplaces, lack of dorm facilities, high dropout rates, adolescent pregnancy, and households taking \nchildren out of school to provide farm labor. At the senior secondary level, enrollments rates are \nonly 60%, of which 60% are male and 40% are female.  \n \n14.  Under the existing education sector funding scheme, the central government pays for \nteacher salaries and provides an operating grant that covers 60% of total operating costs at the \nprimary and junior secondary levels. Provincial and other educational authorities are expected \nto fund 30% of operating costs, while parents and communities are expected to fund the \nremaining 10%. In reality, however, many provinces do not contribute to school operating grants \ndue to revenue constraints. Currently, operating grants are allocated to schools on the basis of \nenrollment numbers rather than need for achieving minimum quality standards.  \n \n15.  The  government  has  adopted  a  sector-wide  approach  to  education.  New  Zealand \nprovides  SI$41  million  in  annual  budget  support  to  the  education  sector  to  assist  the \ngovernment in funding \u201cfee free\u201d education up to form 3, which policy was introduced in 2009. \nThe government has also committed to allocate at least 22% of its total recurrent budget to \neducation.  However,  education  service  delivery,  and  particularly  in  rural  areas,  has  been \n                                                 \n8  Government of the Solomon Islands. 2002.

Health \n \n16.  Despite having among the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the region, health \noutcomes in Solomon Islands have been improving in recent years as a result of substantial \ndonor funding to the health care sector. However, the health care delivery system remains \nhighly centralized with relatively more resources concentrated on the National Referral Hospital \nin Honiara and central administration. As a result, the quality of primary health care outside of \nHoniara and provincial urban centers tends to be poor. Rural health clinics often have no access \nto electricity or running water, and they suffer from shortages of essential medical supplies.  \n \n17.  Households  from  the  bottom  income  quintiles  and  those  living  in  rural  areas  are \ndisadvantaged in their ability to access quality health care. For example, according to the 2008 \nPeople\u2019s  Survey,  65%  of  households  in  Guadalcanal  and  42%  in  Malaita  reported  that  it \nrequired one hour to half a day in travel time to access health care facilities. In Honiara, 80% of \nresidents surveyed reported being able to access medical facilities in less than 1 hour (footnote \n9).  \n \n18.  Primary public health care services are provided to the population free of charge. The \ncentral government pays the wages of medical staff, including doctors and nurses. Provincial \nhealth services are funded through operating grants provided by the central government. On \naverage, less than half of the grant is spent on goods and services in many provinces, however, \nwhile around 55% of the grant is used to pay the wages of staff such as custodians and casual \nworkers. In addition, provincial grants follow a complex funding formula and are not allocated to \nprovinces on the basis of need. For example, Malaita currently receives less than 30% of the \nprovincial health care budget despite one-third of the population\u2019s being located in this province \nand the fact that the country\u2019s most serious health care challenges are found there. \n \n19.  A sector-wide approach has been adopted for the health care sector. Australia remains \nthe largest donor in this area, providing around 25% (SI$61 million) of the total funding for the \nhealth care sector in 2009. This sector has also been adversely affected by the government cut \n(termed a \u201creservation\u201d) amounting to SI$27 million (10% and 25% cuts to nonpayroll recurrent \nexpenditures) made in 2009. In response, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services has been \nable  to  reallocate  some  of  the  funds  from  its  development  budget  to  cover  recurrent \nexpenditures. Health authorities have reported having to cut health care services provided to the \nrural population, however, including transportation to provincial hospitals, health tours, and \ndistribution of mosquito nets.  \n \n3.  Infrastructure \n \n20.  Supplying basic infrastructure to isolated communities spread over a wide geographic \narea remains a challenge, and as a result electricity, water, transportation, and communication \nservices are not available to a large percentage of the population. Only 16% of the total \npopulation  has  access  to  electricity,  which  is  generally  provided  only  in  urban  centers.  In \nHoniara, 40.9% of the lowest expenditure households were connected to power compared with \n87.9%  of  the  highest expenditure  households.  In  rural areas,  given  the  lack of  access  to \nelectricity, kerosene use is high for both the lowest and highest expenditure income households, \n ", "  Appendix 6  61\nat 89.5% and 87.9%.12 Similarly, access to adequate water and sanitation facilities in rural areas \nis low. For example, the percentage of the population with access to safe or improved water \nsupplies in Honiara was estimated to be 95% in 2000 compared with only 65% in rural areas.13 \n \n21.  Outside of the capital city, all-weather roads, which only reach 23% of villages, are either \nnonexistent or in disrepair, and shipping and air services are unreliable and expensive. Intra-\nisland transport is expensive and currently very limited. These constraints pose considerable \nbarriers to market access in rural areas and impede the growth of rural production. Poor \ntransport systems also make it difficult for the rural population to access basic services. \n \nD.  Social Safety Nets \n \n22.  Solomon Islands lacks formal social safety nets. Most Solomon Islanders rely on their \nability to earn a subsistence living and some additional cash income from their land and marine \nresources as an informal social safety net. Strong communities and the wantok system are also \nan  important  informal  safeguard.  Under  the  wantok  system,  those  that  speak  the  same \nlanguage (or share \u201cone talk\u201d) traditionally look out for one another. The wantok system could \nbe seen as an unwritten social contract between those speaking the same language to assist \neach other in times of need. The informal social safety nets are still strong, and they are critical \nto limiting the most extreme forms of poverty in the Solomon Islands. But the relevance of the \ntraditional sources of support is declining as families move to urban areas and away from their \nland and as communities monetize. They are also better suited to situations where only some \nmembers of the community bear extra stress, rather than to the situation of generalized stress \nensuing from the extremely high inflation of 2008 that was triggered by high commodity prices \nand now the economic slowdown. To date, there has been limited provision of formal social \nsafety nets. More effort is warranted to help lessen the strain now borne by the vulnerable. \n \n                                                 \n12  Solomon Islands Statistics Office and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pacific Centre. 2008. \nAnalysis of the 2005/06 Household Income and Expenditure Survey.

The government is committed to promoting gender equity in national as well as regional \nand international development policy frameworks. However, Solomon Islands ranks very low, by \nregional comparison, in both gender development and gender empowerment indices. Women \nhave less access to and control of key political, economic, and knowledge resources than men. \nCurrently, there is no female member in the national parliament. There is a strong traditional \nobligation system that functions as a basic safety net but that also restricts individual control of \nland and exacerbates women\u2019s lack of access to economic resources. \n \n2.  Gender inequity is salient in the areas of education and health. Females have less \naccess than males to education, especially at higher levels of schooling, which results in lower \nliteracy rates among adult women. Women\u2019s access to health and family planning services \nremains poor particularly in rural areas, while the fertility rate is one of the highest in the Pacific. \nLack of investments into women\u2019s education and health undermines their productive capacities \nfor income-generating activities, as well as the health and nutritional status of their children. The \ncurrent economic crisis is likely to worsen these situations unless the government maintains and \nimproves the provision of social services essential for girls and women.  \n \n3.  Poverty  disproportionately  affects  women  and  children.  Additional  factors  such  as \nendemic malaria and natural disasters exacerbate poverty and create increased burdens for \nwomen as caregivers, subsistence farmers, and community members. Gaps in such basic \ninfrastructure services as roads, clean water, and sanitation further limit women\u2019s time and \nopportunity, since women bear the primary responsibility for household management and child \ncare. Gender-based violence is prevalent, and increased economic hardship places women and \ngirls at greater risk both in and outside the family.  \n \nB.  Key Issues \n \n1.  Gender Gaps in Education \n \n4.  While laws and policies give boys and girls the same rights to education, significant \ngender gaps persist in school enrollment, and especially at higher levels of schooling. Gross \nprimary enrollment rates exceeded 90% in 2005, with the ratio of female to male rates at 0.96.1 \nThere is, however, a very low progression rate to secondary, vocational, technical, or post-\nsecondary education. Gross secondary enrollment rates are much lower for both boys and \ngirls\u2014only 27% for girls and the gender ratio is 0.87. A number of donors have invested in \nimproving education infrastructure, with a focus on ensuring accessibility to primary schooling. \nSignificant issues still remain, including access to primary education that is less than universal; \npoor  education  facilities;  and  lack  of  trained,  qualified  teachers.  Enrollment  rates  also  fall \ndrastically at secondary level due to a shortage of schools, a high dropout rate, adolescent \npregnancy, and difficulty in affording school fees and expenses. Girls are likely to be pulled out \nof school more often than boys for economic reasons, household chores, and farm labor. With \ngrowing economic hardship, girls will face more disadvantages in attending or continuing their \neducations, and particularly at the secondary level.  \n  \n                                                 \n1  United  Nations  Development  Program  (UNDP).  2007/2008.  Human  Development  Report  Statistics. \nhttp://hdrstats.undp.org/countries/ data sheets /cty_ds_SLB.html (accessed 12 August 2009).  \n ", "  Appendix 7  63\n2.  Reproductive Rights and Health \n \n5.  Fertility rates remain high at 4.4 live births per woman overall, generating a young \npopulation structure where 40% are under age 15 (footnote 1). While 85% of births are attended \nby health personnel, maternal mortality rate remains high at 220 per 100,000 live births. Also \nhigh are the infant mortality rate at 53 per 1,000 live births and under-five mortality rate at 70 per \n1,000 live births.2 Despite the priority given to reproductive health and family planning programs \nby the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, health and family planning services are poor, \nand particularly in rural areas. There is inadequate access to obstetric care and lack of skills to \nidentify high-risk cases. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services provides family planning \nservices through provincial hospitals, area health centers, and clinics. Nevertheless, a shortage \nof oral and other contraceptives and lack of trained personnel pose serious problems in rural \nareas. According to the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, the contraceptive prevalence \nrate of married women aged 15-49 in 2007 was 25%. The rate of teen pregnancy is also high at \n72 live births per 1,000 women aged 15\u201319.3 In addition to lack of access to quality reproductive \nhealth care, the traditionally low status of women and societal taboos surrounding discussion of \nsexual matters further increase health risks for women.   \n \n6.  Sexual and reproductive rights are not defined in legislation. Policies for HIV/AIDS are in \nplace,  but  implementation  remains  a  challenge  due  to  gender  inequality  and  taboos  on \ndiscussing sensitive sexual issues. As of 2005, there were six reported cases, half of which \nwere women.4  \n \n3.  Infrastructure \n \n7.  Women in Solomon Islands perform multiple roles as household managers, subsistence \nand cash crop farmers, income earners, and active members of churches and community \ngroups.  In  all  these  roles,  infrastructure  services  are  important  determinants  of  women\u2019s \nopportunities.  Solomon  Islands  is  a  rugged  country  with  dispersed  islands;  poor  maritime \nshipping and air services; and limited, poor quality road networks. All of these factors constrain \nthe delivery of basic social services and access to economic opportunities. While 80% of the \npopulation lives in rural areas, water supply and sanitation systems in rural areas are basic. \nOnly 23% of rural households have improved sanitation facilities, compared with 79% of urban \nhouseholds.5  The  proportion  of  rural  households  having  access  to  piped  water  is  51%, \ncompared with 81% of urban households. Less than 7% of rural households have electricity, as \nopposed  to  61%  of  urban  households.  Especially  in  rural  areas,  women  spend  a \ndisproportionate amount of their time collecting fuel wood and water, as well as providing health \ncare for preventable diseases of family members caused by lack of safe water and sanitation. It \nis important to involve women in the design and delivery of targeted infrastructure to reduce \ntheir time burden and to increase opportunities for such other productive activities as developing \nalternative livelihoods and marketing surplus produce. \n \n                                                 \n2  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund.

Labor force statistics are scarce for Solomon Islands, especially for analysis of recent \ntrends. The latest available data indicate that 56% of women aged 15 and older were in the \nlabor force compared with 83% of men in 2005.6 Given the lack of government statistics on \nwomen\u2019s private sector participation or informal economic activity, however, it is difficult to \nestimate the true extent of women\u2019s income-generating activities. Subsistence farming is still \nprevalent, providing economic activity for 80% of the population.7 Previous studies have found \nthat women made up less than one-third of wage workers in nonagricultural employment (in \n1999),8 and women\u2019s work in the formal sector has been restricted to low-paid, low-status jobs \nin the service sector.9   \n \n9.  There  are  no  legal  barriers  preventing  women  from  accessing  credit.  Yet,  various \ndifficulties continue to hinder women from obtaining credit and loans to purchase property or \nstart businesses. Land ownership continues to be customary and decisions regarding land are \nalmost always made by men. As a result, women have little opportunity to leverage assets for \nformal  or  informal  credit.  Anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  even  when  women  meet  the \neligibility criteria, they are perceived to be too high a credit risk and experience long delays in \nthe application process. Microfinance schemes are scarce, and banking services and products \nare scarcely promoted to women specifically for business purposes. Moreover, banking facilities \nare seldom found in rural and remote areas.  \n \n5.  Government\u2019s Gender Policy and Planning Framework \n \n10.  The government ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination \nagainst Women in 2002.  It has yet to submit an initial report, however, and is noncompliant with \nthe Convention in a number of areas. While a National Women\u2019s Policy was introduced in 1998 \nwith the intention to provide a planning framework across ministries, it has not been translated \ninto activities and lacks legislative authority. The Ministry of Youth, Women and Children\u2019s \nAffairs is updating the policy. The government has initiated a number of gender-related reforms, \nin particular those addressing legislative gaps, through the Law Reform Commission and the \nconstitutional reform processes. \n \n11.  The Ministry of Youth, Women and Children\u2019s Affairs has the mandate to promote the \nempowerment of women and girls. The Ministry\u2019s leadership is strong and motivated. The \nimplementation of programs by its Women\u2019s Development Division is, however, undermined by \na general lack of capacity to address issues of gender equity. The division has five provincial \nstaff responsible for skills training and community development programs and two technical staff \nresponsible for policy development and legal reform. The division has poor physical facilities, is \nunder-budgeted,  and  its  programs  are  impaired  by  the  existing  problems  in  government \nprocesses and systems in terms of delivering services to the provinces. Following government \npolicy statements in 2008, a policy on the Elimination of Violence against Women has been \ndrafted and an associated National Action Plan developed by the Ministry of Youth, Women and \nChildren\u2019s Affairs. The Ministry for Police has created a Sexual Assault Unit and a Family \nViolence Unit, and the Ministry of Health has a Gender Based Violence Policy in place. \n                                                 \n6  Asian Development Bank. 2007.

The principal bilateral donors are the Australian Agency for International Development, \nthe  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development,  the  Japanese  International \nCooperation  Agency,  Taipei,China,  and  the  various  agencies  of  the  United  Nations.  The \nmultilateral agencies, which provide grants and loans, are the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe World Bank, and the European Union. \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy (2009\u20132011) for Solomon Islands seeks to \nreduce poverty by promoting equitable private sector-led economic growth through improved \ntransportation  infrastructure  and  services  and  a  stronger  business  enabling  environment.1 \nCapacity development and the promotion of good governance are guiding priorities in this \ncontext, and, to the extent possible, links between the priority areas will be leveraged. ADB will \nnot provide new lending to Solomon Islands until debt sustainability is restored. Assistance \ninstruments include Asian Development Fund grants in the transport sector, country-specific \ntechnical assistance for capacity development and policy reform in the transport sector, and \nprivate sector development. The country program will be complemented by regional technical \nassistance in support of private sector development, environmental issues, and renewable \nenergy. \n \n3.  Australian support for development in Solomon Islands includes funding for the Regional \nAssistance  Mission  to  Solomon  Islands  (RAMSI)  as  well  as  funding  for  its  bilateral  aid \nprogramme  (which  includes  both  regional  and  country-specific  elements).  Total  planned \nAustralian  official  development  assistance  to  Solomon  Islands  in  FY2010  is  around  $250 \nmillion.  Much of the funding and resourcing under RAMSI is concentrated in the security sector \nand support for the Participating Police Force.  Approximately $45 million (18%) of Australia\u2019s \nplanned overseas development assistance will be provided as country-specific funding under \nthe bilateral programme.  This element of the Australian bilateral programme is guided by the \nAustralia\u2013Solomon Islands Partnership for Development that sets out mutual responsibilities \nand accountabilities, and four priority outcome areas.  The four priority outcome areas are: \nimproving service delivery (currently with a focus on health but there is also a commitment to \ninvestigate  options  to  provide  assistance  to  the  education  sector),  improving  economic \nlivelihoods (with a focus on the rural sector), improving economic infrastructure (with a focus on \ntransport, energy and telecommunications) and addressing economic and fiscal challenges \n(through the use of performance linked aid relating to public sector financial management and \nstructural reform). Australia is a key source of support for the health sector, via the provision of \nsector budget support. \n \n4.  The core areas of the New Zealand and Solomon Islands program strategy (2009\u20132018) \nare investing in people through education and skills development and improving livelihoods and \npromoting broad-based economic growth. Underpinning the strategy is support for building \npeace and stability across Solomon Islands by promoting good governance, sustaining key \nreforms, and building safer communities. New Zealand is, via sector budget support, a key \nsource of funds for the fee free education policy introduced in 2009. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

The European Union has a focus on three main areas in Solomon Islands: education in \npartnership  with  the  government  and  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development, \ntransport infrastructure including maritime and rural development (with the World Bank and \nAustralia) through a significant micro projects program, and a major nonstate actors\u2019 support \nprogram. From 2010, European Union will focus on rural development and is likely to withdraw \nfrom the education sector, except for continuing a 4-year commitment to technical vocational \neducation. \n \n6.  The World Bank is cofinancing a major Rural Development Programme in Solomon \nIslands, and it also provides support in the health, energy, and telecommunications sectors, as \nwell as for climate change adaptation. The World Bank is also exploring potential programs in \nyouth unemployment in urban areas, justice for the poor, and economic reform. \n \n7.  Japan\u2019s focus in Solomon Islands has been on infrastructure, including roads, bridges, \nmaritime, and power supply. Japan has also supported the fisheries sector, water supply, and a \nrange of community programs. \n \n8.  Taipei,China provides support to Solomon Islands through a range of funds, including \nthe Rural Constituency Development Fund provided through members of Parliament. \n \nB.  Institutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination \n9.  The Ministry of National Planning and Aid Coordination holds overall responsibility for \ndevelopment partner coordination, with most development partner support provided through the \nDevelopment Budget prepared by the Ministry. Responsibility for coordinating the activities of \ninternational  financial  institutions  rests  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  that  is \nresponsible for the recurrent budget. \n \n10.  The  government\u2019s  aid  and  coordination  system  has  been  hampered  by  capacity \nconstraints and weaknesses in internal coordination among government agencies. Development \npartners are helping redress this by strengthening their coordination, and considerable progress \nhas been made as development partner programs have normalized in the post-conflict period. \nThe  establishment  of  a  new  in-country  presence  of  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  is  further \nimproving development partner coordination.  \n \n11.  A core economic working group was formed in early 2009; it is led by the Ministry of \nFinance and includes key development partners (ADB, the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment, the European Union, the New Zealand Agency for International Development, \nRAMSI and the World Bank). The aim of this group is to strengthen economic management and \n ", "68  Appendix 8 \nfoster a more coordinated and aligned partner response. The forum has shared information, as \nwell as discussed the impacts of the global economic crisis and examined possible options to \nmitigate it, including the potential for support to government finances in view of the deepening \nrevenue shortfalls.  \n \nC.  Achievement and Issues \n12.  The  government  is  hampered  by  capacity  constraints,  which  is  most  noticeable  in \nensuring the timely and analytically based provision of policy advice and implementation of \ngovernment  policies  and  strategies.  Public  officials  are  typically  not  held  accountable  for \nperformance failure, and reports of corruption are too frequent. Ownership of government policy \nand legislation can be lacking, notably at the most senior levels. Significant capacity building is \nrequired in a number of critical areas, including management, policy and program development, \nand service delivery.  \n \n13.  Although its governance ratings under ADB\u2019s 2008 country performance assessment are \nclose to the average for the Pacific countries, Solomon Islands ranks relatively low in the World \nBank  Governance  Indicators  (1996\u20132006)  in  terms  of  control  of  corruption.  The  need  to \nstrengthen checks and balances on executive powers remains high.  \n \n14.  Substantial progress has been made, however, since the arrival of RAMSI in terms of \nbuilding capacity at whole-of-government, agency, and individual levels and reestablishing law \nand order. Law and justice systems and accountability institutions, such as the Office of the \nAuditor General and the Ombudsman\u2019s Office, have been considerably strengthened. While the \nmedia has become an increasingly important force for promoting good governance, public \ndecision making often lack transparency and information availability is constrained by weak civil \nservice capacities (including for data management). \n \n15.  Internationally high levels of development assistance give rise to concerns regarding \nsustainability. Aid effectiveness and impact, levels of local ownership, absorptive capacity, and \ndonor coordination need to be continually reinforced. In recognition of the challenges, efforts \nhave been made to monitor and evaluate partnership activities. More could be done in this \nregard in introducing a systematic, analytical-based approach that draws on a monitoring and \nevaluation  framework  encompassing  all  development  partner  activities.  Dialogue  between \nsenior officials of Solomon Islands and its development partners has improved substantially in \nrecent years. Establishment of the core economic working group in March 2009, with its role in \nhelping manage the economic and fiscal deterioration over 2009, is a key achievement.  \n \nD.  Recommendations \n16.  A new medium term development strategy (MTDS) is expected to be formulated after \nthe  2010  general  elections.  The  overarching  priority  of  the  current  MTDS  is  post-conflict \nreconciliation. The MTDS also accords a high priority for infrastructure development and private \nsector-led growth. The government has pronounced its intentions to align the budget formulation \nand implementation process to the MTDS priorities, especially in terms of delivering essential \nservices and policy reform. The focus of major donors is clear and coordination at national and \nsectoral  levels  has  improved  substantially.  Development  partners  can  continue  to  lift  their \neffectiveness by continuing to work closely together in supporting the priorities outlined in the \nMTDS. This will enhance linkages between development priorities and development partner \nresourcing, and it will provide a broad-based framework for monitoring and evaluation. \n \n ", "Appendix 9  69 \nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Solomon Islands Medium Term Development Strategy (MTDS), 2008\u20132010 focuses on six priorities: (i) reconciliation \nand rehabilitation, (ii) national security and foreign relations, (iii) infrastructure development, (iv) the social services sector, \n(v) the economic and productive sectors, and (vi) civic affairs. The overarching priority of the current MTDS is post-conflict \nreconciliation. The MTDS also accords a high priority for infrastructure development and private sector-led growth. The \ngovernment has pronounced its intentions to align the budget formulation and implementation process to the MTDS \npriorities, especially in terms of delivering essential services and policy reform.  \n \nThe ADB Solomon Islands interim country partnership strategy, 2009\u20132011 is aligned with the MTDS.a It seeks to reduce \npoverty by promoting equitable private sector-led economic growth through improved transportation infrastructure and \nservices and a stronger business enabling environment. Capacity development and the promotion of good governance are \nguiding priorities. \n \nThe Economic Recovery Support Program (ERSP) is anchored in the MTDS. It will provide early, prudent action to help \nreduce the economic and fiscal imbalances aggravated by the global economic crisis. This will in turn help avoid the \nreemergence of potentially destabilizing social tensions. The ERSP contains macroeconomic- and microeconomic-level \nmeasures that will improve the environment for the private sector, thereby contributing to achievement of the country \npartnership strategy. It also contains specific measures to help protect the vulnerable. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \nThe nature of poverty in the Solomon Islands, as in other Pacific developing member countries, relates more to a lack of \naccess to quality essential services (such as water and sanitation or health and education facilities) and lack of income \nearning opportunities than to widespread hunger or destitution. In urban areas, there is better access to cash income but \npoorer access to own-produced food and higher cash requirements for food and nonfood expenditures. In rural areas, \nwhere the majority of the country\u2019s population is located and many households are engaged in subsistence agriculture, \nthere is greater access to own-produced food and a lesser need for nonfood expenditure, but there are larger gaps here in \naccess to essential services. \n \nThe years of conflict that started in 1999 led to collapse of the country\u2019s economy and disruption to the delivery of many \nbasic services, thus resulting in a significant increase in poverty. Although progress has been made in restoring many \nbasic services with substantial external assistance, levels of coverage and quality are generally inadequate outside of \nurban areas. \n \nThere is almost no explicit targeted support to the vulnerable, as the country lacks a formal social safety net system. \nThose living outside the formal economy rely on the ability to earn a subsistence living and perhaps some additional \nincome from their land and marine resources. The wantok system is also an important safeguard. Under the wantok \nsystem, those who speak the same language (thus sharing \u201cone talk\u201d) traditionally look out for one another. The wantok \nsystem could be seen as an unwritten social contract between those that speak the same language to assist each other in \ntimes of need, and land is collectively owned by the wantok. While still strong, the relevance of these traditional sources of \nsupport is declining as families move to urban areas and away from their land, and as communities monetize. They are \nbetter suited to situations where only some members of the community bear extra stress, rather than to the situation of \ngeneralized stress arising from earlier high inflation and now the economic slowdown. \n \n2. Design Features  \nSupport for the vulnerable is a feature of the program, in recognition of the extra hardship imposed by the global economic \ncrisis and the preceding episode of high international commodity prices. Essential public services used by the most \nvulnerable (i.e., basic transport, health, and education services) have been identified, and ADB grant resources will help \nmaintain spending over 2010 and 2011 on the goods and services used in their delivery. \n \nIn addition, a linked project, Supporting and Building Resilience of the Vulnerable, is proposed for financing from the Japan \n ", "Appendix 10  71\nFund for Poverty Reduction. It is proposed that the linked project will (i) provide a short-term response to the vulnerable \n(including unemployed youth, women, low-income households, and people with disabilities) to increase their economic \nstatus, such as through cash for work and cash transfer programs; (ii) pilot a social protection program; (iii) assess target \ngroups and the feasibility of alternative social protection programs; (iv) provide recommendations for a policy framework \nand long-term monitoring system that will strengthen social safety nets; (v) support nongovernment organizations and civil \nsociety activities for the vulnerable; and (vi) undertake socioeconomic monitoring and evaluation on the situation for the \nvulnerable. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nKey Issues.  \nThe program will help the government limit any short-run increase in poverty incidence arising from the economic \nslowdown. Specific actions include to (i) help provide the financial resources needed for the government to protect funding \nfor basic transport, education, and health expenditures, and thereby help ensure the delivery of essential services to the \nvulnerable; (ii) pilot formal social safety nets and support associated policy development; and (iii) improve women\u2019s access \nto credit and encourage their participation in economic activity. Point (iii) will be achieved by making it easier for women to \nform new companies under the Companies Act. Known as \u201dcommunity companies,\u201d these are a special type of company \ndesigned for use by kin groups.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nThe ERSP is seen as establishing a platform for a more extensive public dialogue on economic and fiscal management \nand support for the vulnerable. This will be assisted by links to a proposed Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction project on \nsocial protection. A key tool will be a communications and engagement strategy, the preparation of which is included as \none of five output areas of the program.  \n \nThe design of this platform has been assisted by (i) anchoring the program in the MTDS, which was developed by the \ngovernment through a consultative process; and (ii) drawing on the diagnostic work of the latest Pacific Island Economic \nReport, which incorporated the findings of consultation with a range of community groups. Further, the program has been \nprepared in close collaboration with key development partners through a core economic working group consisting of \ngovernment and development partner representatives. \n \nThe identification of priority services to be supported under the program drew on consultation with the ministries of Health \nand Medical Services, Education and Human Resources, and Infrastructure Development. It considered their priorities and \nbudgets. Discussion was held with the Ministry of Women, Youth and Children\u2019s Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce, \nIndustries, Labor and Immigration on the proposed social safety net concept. Ministries responded favorably to the \nproposal. The Ministry of Women, Youth and Children\u2019s Affairs in particular stated that the proposal was in line with its \npriorities and expressed interest in being involved in the design and implementation of the program. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing           Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nA communications and engagement strategy is to be prepared through the program (under output area 4). \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nWomen in Solomon Islands suffer disproportionately from poor access to essential social services and limited control over \neconomic resources. Gender disparities are significant in education and health, and the situations can further deteriorate \nwith increases in economic hardship. There is a very low progression rate from primary to secondary education, with only \na 27% secondary enrollment rate for girls and a girl:boy ratio of 0.87. As cultural biases favor the education of boys over \ngirls, girls are more often pulled out of school for economic reasons, household chores, and farm labor. While fertility \nremains one of the highest in the Pacific region (4.4 live births per woman), women\u2019s access to health and family planning \nservices is poor, and particularly so in rural areas. This results in high maternal mortality rate (220 per 100,000 live births). \nLack of adequate access to reproductive care also leads to poor nutritional and health status of children. With poor access \nto basic infrastructure services in rural areas\u2014such as roads, safe water, and improved sanitation facilities\u2014women bear \na disproportionate burden in managing households. This means women have little time and opportunity for other \nproductive and income-generating activities. In addition, women have limited access to formal or informal credit due to the \n ", "72  Appendix 10 \ntraditional land ownership that restricts women\u2019s ownership and control of land.    \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to \nand use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nThe program includes a feature that supports the vulnerable population including women, children, the elderly, and \nunemployed youth. In particular, the program will provide financial resources for the government to protect funding for \nbasic transport, education, and health expenditures that will ensure the delivery of essential social services to women and \nchildren. The program will also improve women\u2019s access to credit and encourage their economic participation by making it \neasier for them to form community companies under the Companies Act. In addition, a linked Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction project is proposed: Social Protection of the Vulnerable in the Pacific. It will include specific features for the \nvulnerable, and in particular vulnerable women, through (i) a short-term response for the vulnerable (a block grant to \nselected communities for health-related activities to improve food security and health outcomes for the vulnerable, and \nespecially pregnant women and infants); (ii) a pilot social safety net program (an innovative community social insurance \nscheme with skills development training targeting vulnerable women as primary participants); (iii) capacity development for \nnongovernment  organizations  and  civil  society;  and  (iv)  regional  dialogue,  knowledge  dissemination,  and  project \nmanagement. \n \nIII.
