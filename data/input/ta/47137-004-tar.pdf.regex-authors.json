INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  requested \ncapacity development technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nstrengthen the Ministry of Health (MOH) capacity to implement key components of the health \nsector reform strategy (HSRS), which aims to achieve universal health care by 2015.1  The TA, \nwhich focuses on health governance reforms under the HSRS, was discussed and agreed \nduring a fact-finding mission conducted in 2015. The government concurred with the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Health  sector  performance.  The  Lao  PDR  made  notable  achievements  in  health \noutcomes since the 1990s. Maternal mortality ratio decreased from 405 maternal deaths per \n100,000 live births in 1995 to 197 in 2015, compared to the Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) target of 260. Infant mortality rate fell from 111 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 54 \nin 2014 compared to the MDG target of 45. Child mortality rate was recorded at 71 deaths per \n1,000 live births in 2014 while the MDG target is 70. Only 37% of pregnant mothers have \nadequate antenatal care (four visits to a health practitioner prior to birth). Further, only 41.5% of \nmothers have a skilled birth attendant and 37.5% have an institution-based delivery. Access to \nhealth services, particularly in remote areas, remains inadequate and programs designed to \nhelp  the  poor  are  only  partially  effective.  Utilization  of  health  services  in  the  Lao  PDR  is \nrelatively low\u2014ambulatory care visits per capita per year have been below 1 in most areas of \nthe country.   \n \n3.  Key health governance challenges. High user fees (including cost of pharmaceuticals) \nconstitute a major barrier to access health services, particularly for mothers and children and \nthe poor. FY2012 national health accounts report that 44.5% of total health expenditure was \nout-of-pocket, amounting to $35.5 per capita. In 2014, only 43% of poor families benefited from \nhealth equity funds (HEFs).3 While the number of health workers increased significantly in \n2013\u20132014, primary health care facilities often lack health staff. In 2013, 33% of the health \ncenters had a community midwife (against a target of 100%), and 90% of health centers had \nfewer than four health workers (against a target of at least five). The provincial health offices \nlack information on staff skills and health workforce development and deployment plans. There \nis no functioning regulatory system for licensing and registration of health professionals. While \nthe planning and budgeting capacity of MOH has improved, the link between health services \nperformance and budget allocation remains weak. The financial management systems do not \ncapture the revenue generated by the sale of medicines and fees for services, which constitute \nabout  50%  of  total  revenue  in  the  health  facilities.  The  development  budget,  including  all \nbudgets  from  aid-financed  projects,  is  not  disaggregated,  and  there  is  no  institutionalized \nsystem of national health accounts.  \n \n4.  Government\u2019s sector strategy. The government has introduced policies and strategies \nsince 2000 to guide health sector reforms aimed at achieving the MDGs, improving health \n                                                \n1  Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Ministry of Health. 2013. Health Sector Reform Strategy, \n2013\u20132025. Vientiane. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 April 2016.  \n3  The HEF, established in 2007, provides free public health care services for the poor by removing major barriers to \nhealth facility and/or health service access, such as transportation, the cost of pharmaceuticals, and other health \ncare costs paid by those seeking care.  \n ", "2   \nfinancing and systems, setting standards, and strengthening coordination within the sector. The \ngovernment\u2019s  Eighth  National  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2016\u20132020  reflects  its \ncommitment  to  improve  human  development  outcomes. 4 To  address  key  health  sector \nconstraints,  in  2013  the  National  Assembly  approved  the  HSRS,  which  aims  to  achieve \nuniversal health care by 2025 in line with sustainable development goals.5 A key objective of the \nHSRS is to improve (i) social protection for mothers and children and the poor; and (ii) health \nservice delivery. The HSRS identified a range of governance, public sector management, and \nhealth program reforms to improve the performance and coverage of the health sector. It \nincludes five priority areas: (i) human resources development for health; (ii) health financing; (iii) \norganization and management; (iv) service delivery, with an emphasis on maternal and child \ncare; and (v) information, monitoring, and evaluation.  \n \n5.  To  make  health  services  accessible  to  the  poor,  the  government  introduced  HEF \nschemes across the country. The HEF is a social protection scheme, targeting the poor as \nidentified by village and district authorities. In 2014, HEF schemes covered 46,870 poor families \n(43% of poor households).6 In 2015, 125 districts (out of 146 nationwide) were implementing the \nHEF compared to 106 in 2014. The government also implemented a free maternal, neonatal, \nand child health care (MNCH) scheme, financed by a combination of government revenue and \nexternal assistance. The government established common rules, procedures, and management \nsystems for the schemes to harmonize their implementation. The National Health Insurance \nBureau manages and coordinates the existing health insurance programs, HEF, and MNCH. \nThe  government  will  progressively  increase  the  number  of  beneficiaries  of  social  health \nprotection schemes and health insurance programs, which is the first step in moving toward \nproviding health insurance to 80% of the population, one of the targets of the HSRS. \n6.  ADB strategy and engagement. The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 recommends \nexpanding operations in the health sector to 3%\u20135% of ADB\u2019s annual approvals.7 The Lao PDR \ncountry partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 supports public financial management in the health \nsector.8 ADB has supported health system development through TA projects and programs \nfocusing on governance and public financial management.9 Previous ADB health projects and \nprograms (footnote 9) focused on infrastructure and staff capacity development in selected \nprovinces, and improved the health facility network and access to health services in these areas. \nIn September 2015, the Board approved the Health Sector Governance Program (HSGP), \nwhich supports the implementation of the government HSRS through a programmatic approach \n                                                \n4  Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2015. The Eighth Five-\nyear National Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2016\u20132020.

Subprogram 2, \nwhich is being implemented from August 2015 to July 2018, includes measures to (i) improve \nthe health sector reform process, (ii) improve the implementation of the HEF and free MNCH \nschemes, (iii) strengthen human resource management capacity, and (iv) strengthen the health \nsector  financial  management  system.  A  TA  loan,  attached  to  HSGP,  supports  the \nimplementation of subprogram 2 and provides management support through the provision of \ninformation technology equipment, vehicles, scholarship and training for health staff, studies, \nworkshops, and exchange of experiences with neighboring countries. \n \n7.  Key  features  of  the  technical  assistance.  The  TA  will  support  the  MOH  in \nimplementing key governance components of the HSRS, including (i) reform planning and \nmonitoring; (ii) health financing mechanisms; (iii) health human resources management; and (iv) \nfinancial accountability. The TA will provide national and international expertise in specific fields \nsuch as governance, workforce planning, human resources management, health programs, \nbudgeting, and financial management. These consultants will help implement key health sector \nreforms by developing plans, procedures, guidelines, and training modules. Consultants will \nsupport the training of the staff at all levels. The TA will support key MOH departments such as \nthe  health  minister\u2019s  cabinet,  Planning  and  International  Cooperation  Department,  Finance \nDepartment,  Training  and  Research  Department,  Health  Insurance  Bureau,  and  Personnel \nDepartment.   \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be the achievement of universal health coverage by 2025. The outcome \nwill be strengthened government capacity to implement key components of the HSRS.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Output  1:  Health  sector  reform  planning,  monitoring,  and  implementation \nimproved. The TA will assist the health minister\u2019s cabinet in implementing the health sector \nreform program with support from development partners with an emphasis on: (i) developing the \nstrategy and phasing the health sector reform process as well as establishing a system of \nmonitoring  the  progress  and  effectiveness  of  the  health  sector  reform  program,  and  (ii) \nconjointly  between  MOH  departments  and  development  partners,  developing  a  plan  that \nincludes the selection of provinces and districts to pilot the rollout of the HSRS and to determine \nthe resources available. \n \n10.  Output 2: Implementation of the health equity fund and free maternal, neonatal, \nand child health care schemes improved. The TA will help the MOH develop demand-side \ninterventions to increase universal coverage and reduce the financial barriers to health program \naccess through HEF and free MNCH for the poor. Interventions will include (i) harmonizing \nexisting schemes under the leadership of the MOH, (ii) strengthening MOH capacity to support \nthe provinces and monitor the implementation of the schemes, (iii) strengthening provincial \ncapacity to implement and monitor the schemes, and (iv) providing technical support when \nassessing the health care schemes. Support to the Health Insurance Bureau (under the MOH \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nFinance Department) will focus on four key implementation functions of the HEF and free \nMNCH:  (i)  membership  management,  (ii)  provider  management,  (iii)  benefits  and  provider \npayment design and management, and (iv) information management. The TA will also support \nthe MOH and the Health Insurance Bureau in evaluating the HEF and free MNCH schemes. \nThe  evaluation  will  include  the  impact  of  the  schemes  on  utilization  of  health  services \n(disaggregated by gender and ethnic groups), quality of the services, and user satisfaction.   \n \n11.  Output 3: Human resources management capacity strengthened. The TA will help \nthe MOH Personnel Department and Training and Research Department strengthen health \nworkforce governance and management systems. The TA will improve capacity in managing \nhuman  resources  at  all  levels  of  the  health  system  with  an  emphasis  on:  (i)  developing \nworkforce plans in each province to identify specific local human resource needs and priorities, \nand to aggregate these centrally to determine national priorities; (ii) enhancing and rolling out \nthe  health  personnel  management  information  system;  (iii)  establishing  an  incentives  and \nrecognition system to improve staff morale and productivity, linking performance assessment to \nthe  reward  system  and  opportunities  for  career  progression;  and  (iv)  supporting  MOH  in \ndeveloping  teaching  institutions  accreditation,  and  registration  and  licensing  of  health \nprofessionals \n \n12.  Output 4: Health sector financial management system strengthened. The TA will \nhelp the MOH and the Ministry of Finance improve financial systems as part of the financial \nstructural reform program consisting of: (i) enhancements to provincial planning and annual \nbudget processes and the introduction of a rolling 3-year planning framework, which will form \nthe basis of agreements on provincial financing, including program support; (ii) development of \nprocedures and guidelines to document the sources and application of funds collected and used \nat health facilities (including out-of-pocket expenses and activities financed by the government \nand development partners), which will support facility management and provide information to \nanalyze health facility unit costs across the country (such information is not currently available); \nand (iii) development of a revised budget and expenditure reporting process (format) at the \ncentral and provincial levels of MOH that meets the technical needs of both the Ministry of \nFinance  and  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  which  will  standardize  budgets  and \nexpenditures for projects financed by the government and development partners. \n \n13.  Major risks include (i) patronage and corruption, (ii) decrease in MOH investment in \nhealth infrastructure and equipment, (iii) fragmented roles and responsibilities within the MOH \nand between different levels of government, and (iv) high turnover of management staff. The \nMOH, and the government more generally, have shown significant commitment to health sector \nreform through the development of the HSRS and the HSGP. An ADB-funded project supports \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  and  other  line  ministries  in  budget  planning  and  in  improving  the \nintergovernmental  fiscal  transfer  systems. 11 The  TA  will  strengthen  key  public  finance \nmanagement systems within the MOH, including planning, budgeting, and human resources \nmanagement. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,040,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2012.

The cost estimate and financing plan is \nin Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The MOH Planning and International Cooperation Department will be the executing \nagency responsible for TA implementation. It will monitor milestones, deliverables, and set the \nschedule of the consultants\u2019 inputs. The HSGP project director at MOH will provide overall \nleadership and coordinate TA activities. A steering committee chaired by the minister of health \nwill review and guide TA work. Technical working groups on human resources development, \nquality of care, and health financing will provide technical advice in coordination with experts \nfrom other ministries and development partners, including the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, Luxembourg Agency for Development Cooperation, the World Bank, and the World \nHealth Organization. ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Human and Social Development Division will be in \ncharge of administering the TA. The TA will be implemented from September 2016 to August \n2018. \n \n16.  The consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The TA will support 10 international \nconsultants  and  4  national  consultants  for  a  total  of  144  person-months.  International \nconsultants will be recruited through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection procedures \nwith  simplified  technical  proposal  (quality\u2013cost  ratio  90:10).  National  consultants  will  be \nrecruited using individual consultant selection. Flexibility to mobilize expertise as required will be \nprovided by determining the terms of reference and selection method during TA implementation \nfor 4 person-months of international and 10 person-months of national consulting services, \npossibly in the areas of financing, health policy and governance, accounting, and financial \nmanagement. The Planning and International Cooperation Department and other key MOH \ndepartments  (including  the  health  minister\u2019s  cabinet,  Finance  Department,  Training  and \nResearch Department, Health Insurance Bureau, and Personnel Department) will be engaged in \nmonitoring consultants\u2019 work. Supervisory roles and reporting relationships are reflected in the \nterms of reference for consultants (Appendix 3). The TA will also mobilize short-term resource \npersons to provide specific expertise, as needed.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION   \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $2,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Strengthening Capacity for Health Sector Governance \nReforms, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nUniversal health coverage achieved by 2025 (Health Sector Reform Strategy)a \n    Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and   \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By June 2018:     \nGovernment capacity  1.
