INTRODUCTION\n1. In March 2001, the Government of Uzbekistan and the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) reached an agreement on a new technical assistance (TA) that will support the\nGovernment in preparing a comprehensive medium-term strategy for improving the living\nstandards of the people of Uzbekistan, with special focus on the low-income, vulnerable,\nand  socially  excluded  groups.1  The  components,  technical  requirements,  and\nimplementation arrangements of the TA were discussed with various stakeholders in\nUzbekistan.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Compared with the other Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan experienced a\nmilder output decline at a shorter time frame and less abrupt changes in socioeconomic\ntrends since its independence in 1991. Output contraction in the first half of the 1990s\nwas 20 percent, whereas that in the other Central Asian countries averaged 50 percent.\nGrowth was positive between 1996 and 2000; for 2001, a modest growth rate of 3\npercent is projected. Moreover, because the Government maintained a fairly stable\nsocial expenditure-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio, the human development index\nimproved during the 1990s.2\n3. The challenge for the Government in the new millennium is how to consolidate\nand build from these gains while addressing the emerging signs of deteriorating quality\nof life. In 1999, families in need of social assistance, or those whose average per capita\nincome  was  1.5  times  the  official  minimum  monthly  wage  of  SUM1,320  or  lower,\nnumbered  about  half  a  million  (14  percent  of  total  number  of  families).3  Regional\ndisparities  have  become  more  distinct.  Only  8  of  the  27  geopolitical  divisions  (14\nterritorial administrative units, 12 regions, and Tashkent City) accounted for nearly three\nfourths of the county\u2019s GDP in 1999. Unemployment is also high, especially in the rural\nareas, which is placed at 20 percent. Access to quality and reasonably priced social\ninfrastructure and other social assistance measures for the most vulnerable groups is\nbecoming more inadequate as the Government, with its limited budget, is constrained in\nextending more financial support. The poor quality of health services compounded by\ninadequate municipal services, particularly the acute lack of potable water facilities, has\nhad  deleterious  effects  on  the  quality  of  life,  especially  among  the  rural  populace\nresiding in the drought and environmentally affected areas (e.g., Karakalpakstan).\n                                                          \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities, Internet Edition, on 15 January 2001.\n2  ADB. 2001. Country Strategy and Program Update (2002-2004)- Uzbekistan. pp. 2 and 11; ADB. 2001.\nWomen in the Republic of Uzbekistan. Country Briefing Paper. pp. 1-3.\n3  There is at present no official poverty line in Uzbekistan but several studies done by international funding\nagencies and nongovernment organizations indicate that the level of poverty may be higher. The Human\nDevelopment Report (1999) of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which defined the\npoverty threshold based on a basket of goods for the lowest 10 percent of income groups, estimated\npoverty incidence at 21 percent of total families in 1998. If the $2.15 per capita expenditure per day is\nused, the poverty threshold that is applied to compare the Central Asian economies (World Bank. 2000.\nMaking Transition Work for Everyone- Poverty and Inequality in Europe and Central Asia. Washington,\nD.C: World Bank. p. 3), poverty incidence in 1997 was 39 percent for Fergana, one of the better-off\nregions in the country (Andersen, K. 2001. Analysis of Poverty and Household Expenditure in Central\nAsia- 1993-1999. forthcoming). If severe poverty is based at $1.075 per day as the threshold (Andersen,.\np. 5), 14.2 percent of Uzbekistan\u2019s households would be considered as very poor. A survey that used self-\nranking estimates of poverty line puts the poverty incidence much higher at 40-80 percent in 1998 (cited in\nADB. 2001. Women in the Republic of Uzbekistan. pp. 4-5.).", "2\n4. To  address  these  emerging  issues,  the  Government  has  initiated  several\nmacroeconomic and sectoral reforms that will allow more private sector participation and\neconomic  expansion  as  well  as  support  better  living  standards  of  the  people  and\nvulnerable groups. The reforms include measures such as the privatization of small and\nmedium  enterprises,  partial  liberalization  of  the  cash  market  for  foreign  exchange,\ndevelopment of microfinance and credit union policies, and measures that strengthen\nthe social protection policies for mothers and children and health care reforms.\n5. Some initiatives under way will also provide a more accurate picture of the\npoverty situation in the country. The World Bank\u2019s (WB) Living Standard Assessment\nProject,  which  started  in  November  2001,  will  give  a  deeper  understanding  of  the\nmultifaceted features and the root causes of poverty. A new household budget survey\nwas introduced nationwide in 2001 to replace the old household budget survey used\nsince the Soviet time.\n6. At this stage, the Government needs to design a comprehensive strategy that will\nserve  as  its  guide  in  consolidating  the  gains  achieved  in  the  past  decade  while\naddressing the poverty issues. The priority issues identified by the Government are (i)\nlabor  market  and  employment  analysis,  (ii)  policy  on  income  generation,  (iii)  living\nstandard indicators, (iv) social assistance for the vulnerable and social protection for all,\n(v) regional aspects of living standards, and (vi) human development.\n7. The  TA  is  being  proposed  to  assist  the  Government  in  formulating  a\ncomprehensive medium-term strategy for improving the living standards of the low-\nincome, vulnerable, and socially excluded groups.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n8. The long-term goal of the TA is to reduce poverty in Uzbekistan through the\nformulation and implementation of a comprehensive medium-term strategy for improving\nthe living standards of the people, particularly the low-income, vulnerable, and socially\nexcluded segments of its society. The objective of the TA is to support the Government\nin preparing this medium-term strategy, ensuring broad-based participation of the major\nstakeholders in the strategy formulation process. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nB.  Scope\n9. The TA will have three components: (i) strategy planning and formulation, (ii)\nstatistical  component,  and  (iii)  training  and  capacity  building  on  pro-poor  growth\nstrategies and social policy for key policy makers.\n10. The specific activities under the strategy planning and formulation component are\nas follows: (i) assess pertinent government legal documents and programs as well as\ncurrently available data and other relevant research studies and information related to\nthe improvement of living standards; (ii) conduct special studies and policy analysis on\nthe  six  priority  areas  of  concern  identified  by  the  Government  (para.  6);  (iii)  hold\nparticipatory consultations, focused group discussions, and other modes of participatory\napproaches to identify concerns and determine the role of stakeholders in implementing\nthe strategy; (iv) draft and formulate the medium-term strategy (named Strategy 2010 by", "3\nthe Government) including the action, budget, and communication plans; (v) address\ncross-cutting  topics  like  gender  dimensions  and  governance  and  macroeconomic\nimpediments to sustainable growth and inclusive social development; and (vi) develop a\nweb site that will serve as the repository of all data, documents, and materials gathered\nand studies conducted under the strategy formulation component. The major output of\nthis exercise is the Strategy 2010 report. Complementary outputs will be the technical\nreports, studies, and other analytical papers on the priority issues identified by the\nGovernment. A web site will also be created to disseminate the information generated\nfrom this component.\n11. The TA will support a study of one region that will examine, among others, the\nrole of local governments and local self-managed committees (mahallas) in addressing\nliving  standard  issues.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  is\ninterested in parallel financing a similar study for another region. These studies will be\nused to pilot-test a living standard strategy for one region.\n12. The specific activities under the statistical component include (i) developing a\nmethodology for and a set of living standard indicators that will be adopted by all\nGovernment agencies; (ii) developing appropriate approaches on targeting assistance to\nthe  low-income,  vulnerable,  and  socially  excluded  groups;  (iii)  improving  the  labor\nmarket survey module in the new household budget survey; (iv) integrating qualitative\nand  sociological  (participatory)  information  into  the  new  household  budget  survey\nmethodology;4 and (v) designing a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system that will\nbecome  the  basis  for  gauging  the  government\u2019s  performance  in  reducing  poverty.5\nCross-cutting themes, particularly gender and governance, will be incorporated. The\noutputs of this component will be (i) a common database on living standards that will\nserve as the indicators and parameters for assessing living standards in the country and\nthe  performance  of  the  poverty  reduction  measures;  (ii)  approaches  to  targeting\nassistance; and (iii) a M&E system.\n13. The work in the statistical component will be coordinated closely with the Living\nStandard  Assessment  to  be  conducted  by  WB  in  November  2001.  This  will  avoid\nunnecessary duplication of efforts and ensure the generation of income and nonincome\nliving standard indicators.\n14. The TA will support the training and capacity building needs of the members of\nthe interministerial committee (IC) and the working groups (WGs) on living standard\nstrategy formulation and policy analysis. Some topics to be included in training are the\nvarious development approaches (e.g., market-based and pro-poor growth) and issues\n(especially  gender  and  governance),  private  sector  development,  analytical  tools  in\npublic policy and budget management, governance, and quantitative and qualitative\nmethodologies for generating nonincome indicators.\n                                                          \n4  There are various ways of generating the qualitative (or nonincome) data on poverty: use of focused\ngroup discussions, key informant interviews, case study analysis, self-rank poverty assessments, and\nincorporation of some questions in the household budget survey. The methodologies that will be applied\nand the corresponding resources that these will entail will be some of the concerns that the TA will\naddress under this component.\n5 This will build on the work that is currently being done on a pilot basis by the Center of Economic\nResearch, with financial support from the Department for International Development under its Social\nDevelopment Research and Capacity Building program.", "4\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The estimated TA cost is $1,150,000 equivalent of which $560,000 is the foreign\nexchange cost and $590,000 is the local currency cost. ADB will finance $800,000\nequivalent ($560,000 in foreign exchange and $240,000 in local exchange). ADB will\nfinance the TA on a grant basis, with funds from the ADB-funded TA program. The\nGovernment\u2019s  contribution  of  $350,000  equivalent,  will  cover  office  rent,  transport,\nremuneration  and  per  diem  costs  of  government  officials  and  counterpart  staff\nrepresentatives, the conduct of the living standard household budget survey, additional\nstudies, and portions of the cash outlays for the conduct of the workshops and seminars.\nAppendix 2 shows the breakdown of the cost estimates and financing plan.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n16. The  Cabinet  of  Ministers  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  and  the\nImplementing  Agencies  will  be  the  (i)  IC  for  the  strategy  planning  and  formulation\ncomponent, (ii) State Department of Statistics (SDoS) for the statistical component, and\nthe (iii) Center for Economic Research (CER) for the training and technical capability\ncomponent. Before the start of the TA, the Government will issue a resolution creating\nan IC and seven WGs that will take charge of the component on strategy planning and\nformulation. The head of the Information and Analytical Department will chair the IC. The\nIC will be responsible for writing and disseminating the strategy document and the\nworking papers, and will oversee implementation in the first year.\n17. Seven WGs will be established, six of which will be organized according to the\nsix priority areas (para. 6) that were identified by the Government. They are the WGs on\n(i) labor market and employment, (ii) income generation, (iii) consumer basket and living\nstandard indicators, (iv) regional aspects of living standards, (v) social assistance (for\nthe vulnerable) and social protection (for all), (vi) human development, and (vii) the WG\non strategy formulation. The WGs will work closely with the IC in the strategy planning\nand formulation component. The chairs of the WGs will be Government representatives\nappointed by the IC, and the members will represent multisectors. Each WG will conduct\nan analysis of its area of concern; prepare technical studies and other analytical papers;\nand develop action, budget, and communication plans. Each WG will use consultation\nmeetings and other participatory processes to determine the needs and concerns of the\nlow-income, vulnerable, and socially excluded groups. Their work will be integrated in\nthe comprehensive medium-term strategy report, and will be posted in the web site that\nwill be lodged in the Social Policy Department of the Ministry of Macroeconomics and\nStatistics. The consultants will work closely with the WGs and the IC by providing\ntechnical analysis, studies, and policy and institutional recommendations.\n18. The SDoS will oversee the implementation of the statistical component, ensuring\ncomplementation and strong collaborative work with WB\u2019s Living Standard Assessment\nProject on the living standard indicators.6 The consultants for this component will work\nclosely  with  SDoS  in  identifying  the  living  standard  (quantitative  and  qualitative)\nindicators that will also be used for monitoring and evaluating the poverty reduction\nmeasures and will be incorporated in the household survey; improving the labor survey\nmodule of the household budget survey; and giving training in the use of the improved\n                                                          \n6  Concerted efforts of ADB and WB in this TA will ensure efficient and effective generation of living\nstandard-related data.", "5\nsurvey design. SDoS will conduct the improved survey. The consultants will also assist\nthe WG on the consumer basket and living standard indicators in developing the living\nstandard indicators for use by all Government agencies and the institutional mechanisms\nfor monitoring and evaluating the poverty reduction measures.\n19. The  CER,  together  with  the  consultant,  will  develop  a  training  and  capacity\nbuilding plan for the members of the IC and the WGs. The plan is to be approved by\nADB. For this component, ADB may also coordinate with the Asian Development Bank\nInstitute  (ADBI)  in  providing  additional  financing  for  specialized  seminars  and\nconferences on strategy formulation for high-level policy makers, using regional and\ninternational experiences.\n20. Consulting services for 68 person-months are required (15 for international and\n53  for  domestic  consultants).  The  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be\nengaged through a firm under the simplified technical proposal procedure, in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to\nADB for engaging domestic consultants.7 Procurement of equipment by the consultants\nwill  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Procurement.  Because  of  the  importance  the\nGovernment gives to the strategy formulation process, the Government and ADB will\nclosely supervise the consultants\u2019 work. The consultants are expected to begin work in\nJanuary 2002 and will complete their assignment by 31 December 2002. The outline\nterms of reference are in Appendix 3.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n21. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Uzbekistan\nin an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 for the purpose of Preparing a\nComprehensive Medium-Term Strategy for Improving the Living Standards of the People\nof Uzbekistan, and hereby reports such action to the Board.\n                                                          \n7 ADB will provide the Government a copy of the invitation letter to the consultants including the criteria for\nselecting  consultants  as  well  as  the  consultants\u2019  technical  proposals  for  internal  use  only.

Background\n1. The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  effort  to  formulate  a\ncomprehensive medium-term strategy that will improve the living standards of the majority of its\npopulation with special focus on the low-income, vulnerable, and socially excluded groups. The\nTA will be coursed through a consulting firm, which will be selected in accordance with the\nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.\nB.  Consultants\u2019 Terms of Reference\n2. The TA will need a total of 68 person-months of consulting services: 15 for international\nand 53 for domestic consultants. The consultants will fill the positions and meet the technical\nskills described in the following paragraphs. Their primary tasks will be to provide the concerned\ninterministerial committee (IC), working groups (WGs), and designated implementing agencies\nwith (i) advisory services, (ii) assessment and analysis of living standard-related issues and\nindicators, (iii) assistance in participatory processes and techniques, and  (iv) hands-on training\nand capacity-building for policy makers. The specific responsibilities of each consultant are\ngiven in subsequent paragraphs.\n1.  Living  Standard  Strategist/Participatory  Specialist  (1  international  for  6\nperson-months; 1 domestic for 12)\n3. The  international  consultant  will  serve  as  the  team  leader.
