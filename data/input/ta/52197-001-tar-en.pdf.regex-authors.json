INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help it strengthen the anticorruption regime. The TA \nteam will complete a thorough diagnostic assessment of the case flow of corruption cases. Based \non the assessment, it will then provide training and make recommendations for  legislative \nchanges that would rectify the areas identified for improvement. The TA is consistent with the \nobjectives of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132020, for Mongolia.1 The TA is closely \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,2 in  particular  the  operational  priority  of  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity to ensure less corruption and more equitable growth.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Corruption is considered by many to be widespread in Mongolia. In the most recent \ncorruption perception index prepared by Transparency International, Mongolia ranked 103rd out \nof 180 countries surveyed.4 Mongolia\u2019s ranking had worsened significantly from 2016, when it \nwas ranked 87th. This arises from the slow process of resolving corruption cases at trials, \ndismissals without penalty, and uncompensated state losses. A survey conducted by the Asia \nFoundation shows consistency of opinion that corruption is the most important problem facing \nMongolia (after unemployment), and 75.8% of respondents believe that corruption is a common \npractice in Mongolia.5 Transparency International made recommendations to Mongolia to improve \nits ranking by pointing out the need to (i) create a conducive legal environment to fight corruption; \n(ii) ensure that judges and prosecutors make fair decisions; (iii) strengthen the independence of \nthe investigation, prosecution, and adjudication processes; and (iv) make procurement and \nbudget expenditures accountable and transparent. \n \n3.  The government has placed high priority on reducing corruption in its efforts to promote \nsustainable development. The Sustainable Development Vision 2030 identifies the need to build \na culture of professional, stable, and participative governance, free of corruption and conducive \nto implementing development policies at all levels.6 One of the principles of governance under the \nSustainable Development Vision is to enforce ethics in the public sector and eliminate corruption. \nIn addition, the Parliament of Mongolia passed a resolution for the introduction of the National \nAnticorruption Strategy in 2016.7 The strategy sets clear directions that the government should \nembrace to fight corruption: (i) improve the knowledge and skills of law enforcement agencies to \neffectively detect, investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate crimes related to corruption and misuse \nof office power; and (ii) build a system whereby resolutions of cases of corruption and misuse of \npower are analyzed. More recently, in the Three Pillar Development Policy,8 the government \noutlines the strengthening of fair, disciplined, responsible, and stable government systems as a \ncore pillar. \n \n4.  The Independent Agency Against Corruption (IAAC) is the institution responsible for \nleading and overseeing the National Anticorruption Strategy and, along with the National Police, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

The General Prosecutor Office \n(GPO) is responsible for prosecution, the Judicial General Council (JGC) is responsible for \noverseeing the adjudication, and the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs is responsible for overall \npolicy and overseeing the administration of justice. \n \n5.  Despite the commitment of the government to fight corruption, as reflected in its policy \ndocuments, further efforts are required for success. The Anticorruption Law has not been updated \nsignificantly since 2006, yet the key agencies concerned with the fight against corruption are \nhandling corruption cases that have become more sophisticated and increasingly involve financial \ncrime. These agencies are also seeking to draw on digital technology, both as part of their \nenforcement techniques and to strengthen their communication with the public. This suggests \nthat changes are required to ensure that the law is fit for the purpose and that investigators, \nprosecutors, and judges have the skills and means to fight corruption effectively. \n \n6.  Against this background, ADB will work with IAAC, GPO, and JGC to conduct an in-depth \nassessment of the corruption case flow process and define the areas in need of reform. ADB will \nthen support IAAC, GPO, and JGC in reforming these areas with updated and more effective \nlegislation, guidelines, and recommendations; and provide targeted training to strengthen the \ncapacity of investigators, prosecutors, and judges. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: risk of corruption at all levels of government \nand society reduced (footnote 6). The TA will have the following outcome: anticorruption regime \nin Mongolia strengthened.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Diagnostic assessment of the reporting, investigation, prosecution, and \nadjudication of corruption cases prepared. The output will start with a self-assessment by \nIAAC, GPO, and JGC and involve the examination of the implementation and effectiveness of the \nlegal and regulatory framework as well as the adequacy of the resources, and the capacity and \nindependence of the law enforcement agencies dealing with corruption cases. The assessment \nwill also consider international best practice for jurisdictions with similar size and legal traditions. \n \n9.  Output 2: Capacity of the investigators in IAAC, prosecutors in GPO, and judges in \nthe judiciary enhanced. Based on the results of the diagnostic assessment, the output will \nprovide capacity development for IAAC, GPO, and JGC in the areas most urgently requiring \nrectification. Given the limited TA budget, the capacity building activities will adopt the training-of-\ntrainers method. Participants will be selected based on criteria to be agreed between the law \nenforcement agencies and ADB. At the end of the training, it is expected that the participants will \nprepare handbooks that can then be disseminated widely. \n \n10.  Output 3: Changes to corruption-related reporting mechanisms, guidelines, laws, \nand regulations recommended. Based on the diagnostic assessment, ADB will recommend \nmeasures to fill the gaps found in the corruption-related reporting mechanisms, guidelines, laws, \nand regulations and to allow Mongolia to effectively strengthen its anticorruption regime. \n                                                \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff \nremuneration,  office  accommodation,  logistics  and  administrative  support,  organization  of \nconferences and workshops, printing of training materials, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will implement the TA from December 2018 to 30 June 2021. IAAC will be the \nexecuting agency. The GPO and the JGC will be the implementing agencies. ADB's Mongolia \nResident Mission will lead the TA and will take a one-ADB approach by working closely with other \nADB departments, such as the (i) Office of the General Counsel, (ii) Office of Anticorruption and \nIntegrity, and (iii) Department of Communications (regarding the conduct of workshops and \ntraining programs and the publication of knowledge products).10 IAAC will establish a working \ngroup that will consist of representatives (at least at the director level) of the executing and \nimplementing agencies as well as the TA coordinator (a consultant recruited under the TA). The \nworking group will be chaired by an IAAC representative with the TA coordinator as the secretary. \nADB and the working group will meet each quarter, and more often if needed, to supervise the \n(i) TA's progress, (ii) annual and quarterly TA work plans, and (iii) self-assessment questionnaires \nand other major documents to be produced under the TA. ADB will administer the TA and be \nresponsible for the recruitment and contracting of all consultants in close collaboration with the \nworking group throughout the  recruitment  process. The consultants  will  be  responsible for \norganizing and delivering training to improve the capacity of government staff. At least three \nworkshops (inception, midterm, and final) will be held in addition to the training. \n \n13.  TA support for workshops may include costs related to the venue, equipment rental, \ntranslations, printing and copying, meals, transport, lodging, logistics and administrative support, \nand other expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. In line with standard ADB procedures, \nthe TA will not support the executing agency\u2019s management fees or related costs such as staff \nsalaries and allowances; other executing agency resources, such as office accommodation, will \nbe provided as part of the counterpart contribution. \n \n14.  The executing agency will provide office space, servers, and other equipment required to \nrun the activities. It will also provide access to utilities and telecommunications (including a \nbroadband internet connection) for the consultants. It will supply data and documents as required \nunder the TA. The executing agency will designate a TA focal point with strong English speaking \nand writing skills, and will facilitate all TA activities and links to local government representatives \nand providers to ensure effective implementation of TA activities. \n \n15.  The executing agency will establish a separate advance payment facility in United States \ndollars at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB in coordination with the Ministry of Finance and \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). This will be used to pay for the workshop and training costs, survey costs, and \nreport-publishing costs. \n \n                                                \n10 The TA team will explore collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank, and other \ndevelopment partners. \n ", "4 \n16.

Consulting services. The TA will require 8 person-months of international and 32 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. This includes recruitment of a firm, nongovernment \norganization, research institute, or think tank for the diagnostic assessment; international and \nnational individual consultants for the legislation review; and an individual national consultant to \ncoordinate the TA implementation. Where appropriate, and with concurrence of its Procurement, \nPortfolio and Financial Management Department, ADB will explore the use of output-based \ncontracts  for  individual  consultants  to  ensure  administrative  efficiency  and  to  simplify  the \ndisbursement process. The TA will engage resource persons to deliver the capacity development \nactivities.  The  TA  will  also  cover  the  costs  of  interpretation  and  translations,  and  other \nmiscellaneous costs. ADB will engage the consultants in line with the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions.11 \n \n18.  The consultants will be responsible for producing the TA outputs and deliverables in a \ntimely and effective manner, and for organizing and carrying out all TA activities. They will report \nto the ADB project officer. ADB will evaluate the progress of the TA during review missions and \nworkshops, based on the performance targets and indicators defined in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Mongolia for Strengthening the Anticorruption Regime, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.  \n                                                \n11 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nRisk of corruption at all levels of government and society reduced (Mongolia National Anticorruption \nStrategy).a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and   \n  with Targets and  Reporting   \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2022:     \n \nAnticorruption  a.
