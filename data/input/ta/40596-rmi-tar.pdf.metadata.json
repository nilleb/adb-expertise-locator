Lawrence P. Greenwood  \nVice President (Operations 2) \n     \nFrom:    Philip C. Erquiaga \nDirector General, PARD \n     \nSubject:    RMI: SSTA for Building Capacity for Independent Country Partnership \nStrategy  (CPS)  and  Country  Performance  Assessments  (CPA)  Results \nManagement \u2013 A Pacific Pilot \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) (the Government) has \nrequested a small scale technical assistance (SSTA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto support further strengthening of independent monitoring and management of the results of \nthe future Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and also for the annual Country Performance \nAssessments (CPA). PARD has reached an understanding on the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements  and  terms  of  reference  of  the \nproposed SSTA. A concept paper for the TA was approved by Vice President (Operations 2) on \n26 October, 2006. The SSTA framework is attached as Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.    The Government\u2019s National Development Plan, \u201cVision 2018\u201d provides broad, general \nand wishful guidance to development activity but is neither prioritized nor linked to budget \nexpenditures and revenue generation and other policy formulation. As recorded in the Country \nPerformance  Assessments  (CPA)  of  2005  and  2006,  the  RMI  is  designated  as  a  Weakly \nPerforming Country (WPC) or Fragile State where adoption of improved development policy and \ninstitutional practice has proven to be most difficult. The ADB country strategy for the RMI aims \nto strengthen the performance of the State by improving the enabling environment for private \nsector  activity  and  by  improving  public  sector  performance  and  improved  governance.  As \nrecorded in the current Design and Monitoring Framework of the country strategy for the RMI for \n2007 to 2011 (Appendix 1), development indicators focus on process indicators for improved \nproductivity and performance in the provision of public and private goods and services. \n \n3.    There is a continuing shortage of statistics and statisticians in the RMI despite a series \nof assistance programs2. Recent efforts through TA 4199 \u201cStrengthening the Economic Policy, \nPlanning  and  Statistics  Office  (EPPSO)\u201d  have  however  been  more  successful.  TA  4199 \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 8 June 2006. \n2 This includes earlier ADB TA (RMI TA 1671, 2164, 2295, and 3161). ", "2     \nsucceeded in building up some statistics capacity, rebuilding the statistical data set, and in the \ndrafting of Cabinet policy briefs. This has partly come about through the use of new statistics \ntraining programs to certificate level provided by the University of the South Pacific (USP) \nMajuro  Campus,  and  by  employing  long-term  intermittent  rather  than  permanent  in-line \nconsultants. Other lessons learned from earlier less successful statistics TAs include the need \nfor  greater  local  ownership,  committed  leadership  (which  EPPSO  now  has),  a  stronger \ninstitutional focus to retain knowledge transferred, to balance the levels of training3 and for \ngreater demand for statistics. Where TA 4199 was not so successful was in facilitating Cabinet \ndecision-making and implementation of improved policy. The country strategy for RMI includes \nan EPPSO II TA that will continue the work of TA 4199 including a more comprehensive \napproach to building statistical systems in the country. Fact-finding for this TA is set for 2008; \nthat is after the next elections to be held in November 2007, so that we may better gauge the \ndemand for policy reform and therefore for the statistics that may better inform policy. \n \n4.    The ADB country strategy with the government and people of the RMI has stressed \nextensive demand-side consultation and participation of relevant stakeholders. ADB has funded \nparticipatory  preparation of the earlier CSPU, all TAs, informal and confidential leadership \nretreats,  media  consultations,  and  public  presentations  on  development  policy.  This  has \nsucceeded in stimulating a demand for greater information and knowledge about development \nincluding public debate and discussion of development in 2006. These latter discussions have \nso far included public presentations by many elected and executive officials. More recently the \nNitijela (Parliament) has also started to conduct forum on development issues with NGOs. The \nCollege of the Marshall Islands (CMI) has now decided to establish a Public Policy Institute at \nthe College. \n \n5.    For a number of years now the Government of the RMI, through the Ministry of Finance \nand EPPSO, has been making brave efforts to introduce performance-based budgeting. The \nvarious  efforts  to  build  statistical  data  sets,  to  introduce  performance-based  budgeting, \nstrengthen  results-based  planning,  and  to  raise  the  public  demand  for  improved  policy \nformulation and decision making all need to be linked. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.    The  SSTA  will  build  both  RMI  country  statistics  generation  and  policy  analytical \ncapacities and, at the same time, continue to strengthen country demand for an independent \nmonitoring of, and management for, development results. Evidence of stronger independent \nmonitoring and managing for development results in the RMI will be recorded in the annual ADB \ncountry programming missions. Evidence of greater public policy debate and improved policy \nimplementation will be recorded in annual CPA narratives and ratings. One key outcome will be \nthe commencement and functioning of the Public Policy Institute at the CMI. \n \n7.    It is expected that the SSTA will result in a proven method of building statistics capacity \nand  independently  managing  for  development  results  that  can  be  readily  replicated  at \ncomparatively low cost in other PDMCs that have USP country campuses. Eleven of the 14 \nPDMCs have USP country campuses. The replication will require designation of equivalent \n                                                 \n3 This includes avoiding too great an emphasis on tertiary training at the expense of more basic training. Tertiary level \ntraining  can  also  result  in  loss  of  senior  statisticians  to  more  senior  administrative  positions  and  loss  of \nprofessionals overseas.  ", "  3\nPublic Policy Institutes in each country. Replication could be subsequently included in the 11 \ncountry programs, possibly through a RETA. \n \n8.    As with all other RMI TA, this SSTA will be independently monitored by a domestic \nconsultant or NGO (\u201cmonitoring consultancy\u201d). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.    The lessons of earlier TA, the less successful statistics TAs as well as other RMI TA \nhave been taken into account in designing this proposal. The proposal consists of 3 inter-related \ncomponents: (i) the in-country part-time training of a group of 5 islanders (2 from the national \nplanning office, 2 from major spending Ministries \u2013 Education and Health, and one from the \nNGO community) in statistics to certificate level at the University of the South Pacific (USP) \ncountry campus of the RMI. This is a 3-year course. Director EPPSO will prepare selection \ncriteria and process and submit this to ADB. The 3-year, part-time certificate level training is \nvocational training in nature and, at such level, will allow departments and NGO to more readily \nretain trained staff; (ii) as a complement and in parallel to their studies, the same students will \ncontribute to and report on both the monitoring of the ongoing ADB country strategy and \nprogram  and  the  annual  Country  Performance  Assessment  (CPA)  for  the RMI. This latter \ncomponent  will  be  assisted  by  domestic  and  international  consultancies;  and  (iii)  an \nindependent,  non-government  entity,  the  new  Public  Policy  Institute  of  the  College  of  the \nMarshall Islands will host a series of 6 independent public discussions of both future CPS and \nCPA country development progress in the form of regular workshops in-country. This will be \npreceded by stakeholder analyses for each policy discussion. This will continue to build the \ndemand  for  policy  discussion,  policy  analyses,  and  ultimately  a  demand  for  statistics  and \ntherefore for greater statistical capacity, in support of such analyses and dialogue. Findings will \nbe reported in country and regional media as well as by the monitoring consultancy and by \nADB. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $300,000 equivalent. The amount of $150,000 will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Managing  for  Development  Results  Cooperation  Fund \nadministered by ADB. The CMI will provide $50,000 in matching funds for the resource persons \nand Government and the NGO will provide $75,000 equivalent for local currency costs in the \nform of salaries for the 5 staff to be trained over 3 years. Government will also supply services \nand facilities including counterpart staff, office accommodation and transport and administrative \nresources ($25,000). Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 3. \nThe SSTA classification is attached in Appendix 5. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The executing agency would be the Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office \n(EPPSO) of the Chief Secretary\u2019s Office. Implementing agencies would be USP and the College \nof the Marshall Islands. The initiative will be monitored and evaluated by an independent NGO \nto be selected by the national NGO umbrella organization, MICNOs. \n \n12.  EPPSO, other relevant government departments, the USP, and the CMI all support the \nproposal. They have all provided information and support to the formulation of the concept \npaper. The 5 staffs to be trained are all currently employed and will all be released by their \nrelevant departments and agencies (NGO) for the required training. Five EPPSO staffs have ", "4     \nalready been successfully trained to certificate level in statistics at the USP campus. CMI is \ncreating a \u201cPublic Policy Institute\u201d and this exercise will greatly help with the formulation of the \nInstitute. \n \n13.  The TA is expected to commence in December 2006, with completion by end 2009. Six \nindividual  international  resource  persons  will  be  individually  engaged.  The  international \nconsultants  will  comprise:  (i)  a  public  policy  specialist  and  macroeconomist;  (ii)  an \nenvironmentalist;  (iii)  a  governance  specialist;  (iv)  a  public  services  delivery  specialist;  (v) \nprivate  sector  development  specialist;  and  (vi)  a  social  protection  and  gender  specialist. \nAppendix 4 gives outline terms of reference for the consultants. The consultants will be selected \nand engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the use of Consultants. \n \n14.  The consultants will each prepare a report on all activities at the conclusion of their \nindividual consultancies. All consultants will help the statistics trainees to analyze and report on \nthe country strategy design and monitoring framework and the country performance assessment \ncriteria as relevant to their expertise. The consultants will also work with the new Public Policy \nInstitute of the CMI and help the Institute to organize public presentations on progress in policy \nformulation to the Nitijela (Parliament), Cabinet and the public. \n \nIV.
