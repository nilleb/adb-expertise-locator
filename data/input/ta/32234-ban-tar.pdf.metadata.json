INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of Bangladesh has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for\nassistance in preparing a project (or sector development program) to continue the restructuring\nof  Bangladesh  Railway  (BR).  The  project  would  entail  developing  policies  and  preparing\ninvestment packages to promote subregional cooperation and development of rail traffic. The\nFact-Finding Mission visited Bangladesh from 30 January to 5 February 2000 and reached an\nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, and terms of\nreference for the TA.1 The TA framework is provided in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. With a land area of only 144,000 square kilometers, Bangladesh has a high population\ndensity: 872 persons per square kilometer. People\u2019s mobility is still fairly low, partly because of\nthe dominance of agriculture in the economy. As experienced in other countries, the modal\ndistribution of traffic is steadily shifting to road transport. During the last decade, road transport\nhas grown from 59 to 63 percent of total freight volume; railways\u2019 share has slipped from 11 to 9\npercent of total freight volume. Similarly, railways\u2019 share of total passenger volume has declined\nfrom 17 to 13 percent.\n3. The shifts in traffic patterns stem largely from steady road transport improvements and\ndeclining  quality  and  efficiency  of  rail  services.  Institutional  shortcomings  and  physical\nbottlenecks  in  terms  of  poor  infrastructure  and  antiquated  rolling  stock  have  reduced  the\ncompetitiveness of rail. BR is also severely restricted by its two different gauge systems (broad\nand meter gauge), which is a legacy from the development of the railway network on the Indian\nsubcontinent  prior  to  its  partition  in  1947.  As  a  result,  road  transport  now  dominates  the\nmovement of short-haul traffic, and railways concentrate on long-haul transport, particularly\nfreight movements and intercity passenger traffic. Increasing road traffic has in turn led to\nincreasing environmental damage in terms of pollution, congestion, road traffic accidents, and\nfatalities,2 particularly in greater Dhaka, on the high-density corridor between Chittagong and\nDhaka, and the northwest region of Bangladesh. Environment-friendlier transport systems3 such\nas rail transport are needed to prevent increases in environmental damage, improve safety, and\nsave energy, particularly in light of expected high increases in population density4 over the next\ndecade. Experience elsewhere shows that public transport, including railways, is increasingly\nattractive for countries with high population densities to achieve sustainable development.\n4. The  fairly  low  transport  intensity  of  the  Bangladesh  economy  as  compared  with\nneighboring countries is expected to increase considerably in the coming years. This is mainly\nbecause of the increasing demand for freight transport and the expected increase in personal\nmobility as a result of higher gross domestic product growth at 4 to 5 percent per year and\nincreasing urbanization in the greater Dhaka area. The opening of the Jamuna Bridge5 in June\n1998 removed one major national transport barrier in Bangladesh. Because of this project and\n                                                \n1 The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in February 2000.\n2 The average annual fatality rate for Bangladesh road transport is around 69 per 10,000 registered vehicles, which\ncompares unfavorably with other countries, e.g., 45 in India, 13 in Indonesia, and 7 in Thailand.\n3 The external costs for road traffic accidents, air pollution, and noise are about 5 to 10 times higher for road traffic\nthan  railway  traffic  according  to  research.  For  example,  see,  Hansson,  Lars.  1995.  Towards Sustainable\nTransportation\u2014Going from mere words to practice. International Institute on Industrial Environmental Economics,\nLund University; and Earthcan Publications Limited. 1996. The True Cost of Road Transport. London.\n4 The population of Bangladesh grows by more than 2 percent yearly and is expected to double in 2010 putting\nadditional pressure on scarce land.\n5 Loan 1298-BAN(SF): Jamuna Bridge Project, for SDR145,607,000, approved on 8 March 1994.", "2\nother ADB-financed road and rail link projects,6 freight and passenger transport are expected\nto increase. These major transport development projects are crucial for physical and economic\nintegration of Bangladesh, linking the western part of the country with the commercial center of\nDhaka and the country's primary port of Chittagong, both in the eastern half of the country. They\nare  also  important  to  improve  access  of  the  large  proportion  of  poor  people  living  in  the\nagricultural areas in the northwest.\n5. Because of its location, Bangladesh is well placed to act as a hub for subregional\ntransport, more effectively linking Bhutan, India, and Nepal; providing access to ports; and\noffering transit routes for India to its eastern states. While trade is expected to increase among\nthese countries during the next decade, improved trade facilitation and expansion of transport\ninfrastructure, specifically road and rail links, will be crucial to meet the expected increase in\ntransport demand, particularly for freight. Interregional rail traffic between Bangladesh and India\nis already increasing at about 40 percent per year. This is placing considerable pressure on the\nexisting rail network in Bangladesh, which presently is in very poor condition. These constraints\nare accentuated by the meter-gauge track network on the eastern side of Jamuna River in\nBangladesh and the use of broad-gauge track by Indian Railways. Another major constraint is\nthe outdated operational procedures and cumbersome administrative arrangements at border\ncrossings between Bangladesh and India.\n6.  The ongoing Jamuna Bridge Rail Link Project will, when completed early in 2002, unite\nthe railway system in Bangladesh. Designed as an interim solution over the medium term, it\nprovides for operation of dual-gauge track7 to Dhaka. This will enable both broad- and meter-\ngauge traffic between the eastern and western parts of Bangladesh, utilizing the Jamuna Bridge\nuntil a complete subregional broad-gauge system can be completed. It is envisaged that this\nbroad-gauge system will ultimately connect Chittagong and Dhaka, and also link the eastern\nand western parts of India through a broad-gauge transit route through Bangladesh. Due to the\ntechnical issues, costs involved, and political environment, the inauguration of a complete\nbroad-gauge subregional system may take up to 10 years.\n7. To promote subregional trade and cooperation, the World Bank financed a study on\ntrade facilitation and logistics.8 This study focused on six major subregional transport (road, rail,\nand inland water transport) corridors. Four of these corridors include rail links that traverse\nBangladesh. The emerging subregional rail network development plan for Bangladesh draws on\nthis study and on the rail strategy developed by the Government and BR with support of TA.9\nThe strategy of the Government is consistent with recommendations made by the Economic\nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) on the Trans Asian Railway and\nregional rail network plans developed by the International Railway Union (UIC). ADB, in close\ncooperation with ESCAP and UIC, is actively pursuing several regional railway issues, including\n(i) removing or relaxing administrative and technical barriers between railways, (ii) improving\ncross-border  arrangements  for  more  efficient  operation,  (iii)  developing  arrangements  and\nagreements for exchange of freight wagons, and (iv) harmonizing technical standards for rolling\nstock  and  addressing  other  standardization  issues.  These  are  all  important  for  reducing\ntransport  costs  and  improving  the  reliability  and  quality  of  rail  services  to  increase  trade\nbetween the countries. Supported by ADB,10 BR and Indian Railways have jointly established a\n                                                \n6 Loan 1478-BAN(SF): Jamuna Bridge Access Roads Project, for SDR49,856,000, approved on 5 November 1996;\nand Loan 1561-BAN(SF): Jamuna Bridge Railway Link Project, for SDR80,670,000, approved on 2 October 1997.\n7 Dual gauge involves the installation of a third rail, allowing both broad- and meter-gauge operations over the same\nset of tracks.\n8 World Bank. 2000.

As an\noutcome of these initiatives, it is expected that the existing rail traffic agreement between India\nand Bangladesh will be revised and renegotiated.\n8. ADB\u2019s operational strategy for Bangladesh emphasizes poverty reduction. In April 2000,\na milestone event took place when the Government and ADB signed a poverty reduction\npartnership agreement. ADB\u2019s operational strategy also stresses private sector participation in\ninfrastructure wherever feasible, and promotes subregional cooperation. In response to the\nincreasing demand for rail transport, ADB\u2019s rail strategy aims at restructuring BR into a more\ncommercialized  and  efficient  undertaking.  The  rail  strategy  emphasizes  development  of  a\nharmonized and standardized subregional rail network, offering enhanced freight services and\nimproved access to the poorer areas. During the last decade, the Government, supported by\nADB, has made notable progress in restructuring BR. Under the Railway Recovery Program,11\nwhich  was  implemented  from  1994  to  1998,12  the  Government  took  significant  steps  to\ncommercialize  and  restructure  BR;  this  largely  involved  restructuring  the  organization,\nintroducing new tariff policies, and reducing staff numbers (from 55,400 in 1992 to 38,100\nin1999). As the next step in reform, the Government aims to restructure BR along commercial\nlines by separating operations from infrastructure and introducing rail concessions with private\nsector participation. This follows best practices adopted in other countries.13 Because of the\ncomplexity and long-term nature of the railway reform program, the Government has separately\nasked  ADB  to  provide  advisory  TA  to  develop  the  necessary  regulatory  and  institutional\nframework.\n9. Since the mid-1970s ADB has been the lead agency in the rail sector and has provided\nfour loans totaling $259 million, and 14 TAs totaling $3.4 million. ADB has been involved in\nseveral TAs with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and bilateral funding\nagencies.  Bilateral  agencies  active  in  the  sector  include  the  Canadian  International\nDevelopment Agency, France, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr\nTechnische  Zusammenarbeit  of  Germany,  and  Spain.  More  information  on  the  external\nassistance to the rail sector is provided in Appendix 2.\n                                                \n11Loan 1310-BAN(SF): Railway Recovery Program, for SDR58,135 million, approved on 8 September 1994.\n12The project completion report (PCR: BAN 24000) rated this project as generally successful, achieving its intended\nobjectives.\n13Separation of rail infrastructure and operations and introduction of rail concessions has developed as one of the\nbest practices adopted for small- to medium-sized railways with mixed passenger and freight traffic, notably in\nAfrica, Europe and South America.", "4\nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n10. The objective of the TA is to assist the Government to prepare a policy program and\ninvestment package that promote subregional rail traffic.\nB.  Scope\n11.  The main tasks of the TA include (i) define appropriate institutional arrangements and\noperating  principles,  including  conventions  and  other  agreements  required  to  promote\ninternational rail traffic with efficient cross-border and customs procedures; (ii) prepare a policy\nmatrix summarizing the objectives, goals, outputs, and assumptions for the regional traffic\nenhancement  program;  (iii)  assess  the  appropriate  role  for  railways,  and  estimate  the\nsubregional  demand  for  rail  traffic;  (iv)  based  on  forecasted  demand,  estimate  investment\nrequirements and prepare a prioritized investment plan for a 10-year period, and update the\nstaff rationalization plan, including appropriate retraining and redeployment schemes; (v) assess\nthe costs and benefits of the proposed investments and prepare a financing plan; (vi) review the\ntariff-setting procedures, recommend a tariff regulation policy and a charging structure for the\nuse  of  infrastructure  for  international  rail  traffic,  and  propose  appropriate  tariff  rates;  (vii)\nevaluate the financial performance of BR taking into account the proposed investment program,\nand prepare financial projections for a 10-year period; (viii) carry out financial and economic\nanalysis of the investments including risk analysis; (ix) carry out social analysis, and estimate\nthe effects on households and areas classified as poor, and if required, prepare a resettlement\nplan; and (x) undertake initial environmental examination, and if required, environmental impact\nassessment. The terms of reference for the consultants are given in Appendix 3.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The TA is estimated to cost $1,130,000 equivalent; $710,000 is the foreign exchange\ncost and $420,000 equivalent the local currency cost. ADB will provide $900,000 equivalent on\na grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan to cover the\nentire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $190,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The\nGovernment  will  provide  the  remaining  local  currency  of  cost  of  $230,000  equivalent  by\nproviding office accommodation, support facilities, local communications, and counterpart staff.\nThe Government has been informed that ADB approval does not commit ADB to finance any\nsubsequent program or project. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in\nAppendix 4.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n13. About  26  person-months  of  international  and  about  26  person-months  of  domestic\nconsultants  will  be  required  with  expertise  in  international  railway  operations,  railway\nrestructuring,  railway  engineering,  financial  and  economic  analysis,  traffic  costing,  and\nenvironmental and social analysis and human resource development. The TA consultants will\nbe  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other\narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Office\nequipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines for Procurement.    The\nGovernment has been informed about the ADB Anticorruption Policy in relation to the ethical\nstandards to be maintained during recruitment of consultants.\n14. BR, which has extensive experience in implementing ADB-financed projects, will be the\nExecuting Agency. It will appoint a project director acceptable to ADB. The project director will", "5\nliaise with the consultants and coordinate the work under the guidance of the director general\nof  BR.  The  project  director  will  assist  the  consultants  in  organizing  high-level  meetings,\nworkshops, seminars, and all other related activities under the TA. Given the subregional\ndimension of the TA, the consultants will undertake consultations with Indian Railways and\ntransport officials in Bhutan and Nepal. The consultants will coordinate the work with other\nexternally financed consultants in the rail sector. There will be regular review meetings involving\nthe Government, consultants, and ADB. The TA is expected to commence on 1 December 2000\nand be completed by 30 June 2001. The consultants will submit inception, interim, draft final,\nand final reports.\nIII.

The Asian Development Bank is the lead assistance agency in the railway sector,\nhas made four loans totalling $259 million and 14 technical assistance (TAs) totaling $3.4\nmillion.  The first two loans1  focused on rehabilitating the most important main lines. These\nprojects covered the rehabilitation of the meter-gauge line from Chittagong to Dhaka and on\nthe broad-gauge line from Khulna to Parbatipur in the West Zone, including components to\nimprove the rolling stock and maintenance facilities.  Two other ADB loans2 had components\nto restore the flood-damaged railway infrastructure. The policy-based Railway Recovery\nProgram loan was ADB\u2019s third loan for the railway sector. To support the implementation of\nthe Program, ADB has financed three advisory TAs.  In support of organizational reform of\nBangladesh Railway (BR), a comprehensive rail sector study3 was carried out to address\npertinent sector issues and prepare a railway reform program.  Following Cabinet approval\nin July 1995, a second phase TA4 was approved to implement the recommended reform\nmeasures. To monitor the implementation and progress of the railway reform program, ADB\nfinanced a small-scale advisory TA.5  In December 1994, ADB appproved a TA to prepare\nthe Jamuna Bridge Railway Link Project.  The Project,6 comprising a dual-gauge railway\ntrack on the Jamuna Bridge and approaches connecting to the existing railway system on\nboth sides of the Jamuna River, was approved in October 1997.\n2. ADB and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have been jointly\ninvolved in several TA projects in the railway sector.  Two UNDP grants7 covering intermodal\ntransport and advisory TAs have been administered by ADB.  UNDP has also financed the\nBangladesh Transport Sector Study, with the World Bank as the Executing Agency; it was\nimplemented during 1996 and 1997. Bilateral agencies, active in the railway sector such as\nCanadian International Development Agency, France, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau and\nDeutsche Gesselshaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit of Germany, and Spain, support the\nrailway reform program and look to ADB as the lead agency in giving BR direction for\nimplementation of reform measures.\n                                                          \n1  Loan 215-BAN(SF): Railway Project, for $23 million, approved on 23 December 1974; and Loan No. 684-\nBAN(SF): Second Railway Project, for SDR39,019,779, approved on 26 June 1984.\n2   Loan 892-BAN(SF):  Flood Damage Restoration (Roads and Railways) Project, for SDR28,220,762, approved\n    in June 1998; and Loan 976-BAN(SF): Second Flood Damage Restoration Project, for SDR67,627,333,\napproved in August 1989.\n3   TA 1819-BAN: Organizational Reform of BR, for $1.5 million, approved on 22 December 1992.\n4   TA 2544-BAN: Organizational Reform of BR, for $1.0 million, approved on 21 March 1996.\n5   TA 2230-BAN: Monitoring of Railway Recovery Program, for $100,000, approved on 9 December 1994.\n6   Loan 1561-BAN(SF): Jamuna  Bridge Railway Link Project, for SDR80,670,000, approved on 2 October 1997.\n7  TA 567: Intermodal Transport Study, for $358,000, approved on 9 January 1984 and TA 607: Second Railway,\nfor $990,000, approved on 26 June 1984.\n(Reference in text: page 3, para. 9)", "9\nAppendix 3, page 1\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS\nA.
