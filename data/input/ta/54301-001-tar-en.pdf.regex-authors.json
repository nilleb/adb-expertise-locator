INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the development of \nknowledge and policy insights on digital entrepreneurship in Asia and the Pacific. The Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill carry out the TA project in collaboration with leading global and regional experts, and outputs \nwill be shared and disseminated to policy makers and stakeholders of entrepreneurial ecosystems \nof digital entrepreneurs in Asian economies.1 \n \n2.  The proposed TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 in promoting, facilitating, and driving \ninnovation.2 In particular the TA supports operational priority 1 of the strategy\u2014addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities\u2014through its focus on digital entrepreneurship, which \nwill lead to generation of quality jobs and improved education and training. The TA will also \nsupport  women  and  youth  entrepreneurs,  thus  contributing  to  gender  equity  and  youth \nemployment. The TA is aligned with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 and the declaration \nof the G20 leaders in Osaka, Japan in 2019.3 It will also contribute to the Master Plan on ASEAN \nConnectivity 2025, which reaffirms the need to support the adoption of technology by micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).4 Although not a part of the 2020 ERCD annual work \nprogram, the proposed TA will advance knowledge about digital entrepreneurship, which can help \ndeveloping Asia's economies recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digitalization in almost all aspects of life, driven \nby a proliferation of remote working, remote learning, online shopping, movie streaming, and \nvideoconferencing. Information and communication technology (ICT) has enabled organizations \nto continue operating amid global lockdowns and social distancing measures. The post-COVID-\n19 \u201cnew normal\u201d will continue to be highly digitalized, reinforcing the importance for developing \nAsia of digitally transforming their economies. Digital entrepreneurs were already a growing force \nin the world economy before the outbreak. Accelerated digitalization brought about by COVID-19 \nis bringing digital entrepreneurship further to the fore.6 \n \n4.  Nurturing digital entrepreneurship can help developing member countries (DMCs) adapt \ntheir economies to the post-COVID-19 world. Yet there have been few efforts to  facilitate \nknowledge  sharing  among  countries  regarding  what  works  in  terms  of  nurturing  digital \n \n1 An entrepreneurial ecosystem is a regional community of stakeholders that specializes in facilitating the start-up and \nscale-up of entrepreneurial firms that compete by means of digitally enhanced business models (Autio et al., 2018). \nThe community may include prospective and active entrepreneurs; accelerators, co-working spaces, and makerspaces; \ninvestors and financiers; trainers, consultants, and advisors; regional and national support agencies; and other \nsuch stakeholders. E. Autio, S. Nambisan, L. D. W. Thomas, and M. Wright. 2018. Digital Affordances, Spatial \nAffordances, and the Genesis of Entrepreneurial Ecosystems. Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal. 12(1). pp. 72-95. \nNew Jersey. \n2 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n3 SDG  8  envisions  development-oriented  policies  that  support  productive  activities,  decent  job  creation, \nentrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and growth of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises; G20. 2019.

Jakarta. \n5 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 October 2020. \n6 Digital entrepreneurship is broadly defined as creating new ventures and transforming existing businesses by \ndeveloping novel digital technologies and/or novel usage of such technologies.

Brussels. \n ", "2 \n \nentrepreneurs and digital entrepreneurial ecosystems. This scarcity of knowledge contributes to \nmany DMCs having weak institutions and policies for digital entrepreneurship. \n \n5.  Although entrepreneurs have been hit hard by COVID-19, those that have effectively \nleveraged digital technology generally have weathered the pandemic more effectively.7 Digital \nentrepreneurs have thrived during the pandemic and they are likely to play a large role in the \nincreasingly digitalized post-COVID-19 world. ICT can substantially reduce the cost of starting a \nbusiness, opening up fresh entrepreneurial opportunities for women, youth, and the poor.8 \n \n6.  Strengthening digital entrepreneurship can thus help Asian economies recover from \nCOVID-19 and serve as an engine of inclusive growth. Although governments and the private \nsector in many Asian countries have already begun to respond to digital opportunities, much \nremains to be done and there is sizable scope for stakeholders to improve their policy-relevant \nknowledge and build dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystems.9  This TA project will foster digital \nentrepreneurship by addressing these knowledge gaps. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) remaining poverty and inequalities for \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s population affected by economic crisis reduced; (ii) quality jobs generated amid \nimproved business environment for digital entrepreneurs, companies, and MSMEs; and (iii) \nwomen\u2019s resilience to external shocks strengthened through improved access to job skills and \nsupport for women\u2019s entrepreneurship.10 The TA will have the following outcome: knowledge \nregarding how DMCs can unlock and nurture the productivity potential of digital entrepreneurs.11 \nThe TA\u2019s outcome is thus an important step to strengthening digital entrepreneurship in DMCs. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  The knowledge gaps that DMC policy makers face in harnessing the potential of digital \nentrepreneurship for inclusive growth include: (i) undeveloped metrics and data systems to help \npolicy makers map digital entrepreneurial ecosystems and monitor their development; (ii) lack of \na systematic approach for policy makers to learn from the best practices of successful digital \nentrepreneurship ecosystems; and inadequate capacity of policy makers to establish a proper \n \n7 This report distinguishes between different types of digital businesses and digitally enhanced businesses. First, digital \nsectors are based on United Kingdom (UK) Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) standard industrial \nclassification (https://is.gd/Ppd7M7). Second, the TA team will develop an adaptation of the UK TechNation\u2019s \nmethodology (https://technation.io) for tracking digital start-ups that exceed $1 billion in market capitalization. Third, \ngiven that digital technologies are generic technologies (i.e., their adaptation is not restricted to specific industry \nsectors), when surveying companies, the TA team will develop a measure of the degree of digitalization of an \nentrepreneurial company\u2019s business model. \n8  E.g., an artist with an Etsy online shop should have lower startup costs than a jeweler looking to open a boutique at \nthe local mall. Etsy is a vibrant online marketplace for handmade goods, many of which are made and sold by female \nentrepreneurs. \n9 New venture accelerators have been created in many member countries, and they have set up national start-up \ncouncils to coordinate across sectoral policies, and have developed vibrant entrepreneurial hubs. \n10 (i) ADB. 2018.

Filling these gaps will strengthen the capacity \nof DMCs to nurture digital entrepreneurship. The proposed knowledge solutions take the form of \nthree outputs. \n9. Output 1: Updated metrics and public data on digital entrepreneurship enhanced.\nThis  component  will  answer  questions  about  the  number,  size,  and  sectors  of  digital\nentrepreneurs in Asian economies, and the implications of digital technology for new forms of\nentrepreneurship, especially in the MSME segment.12 The TA team and project experts will\nanalyze  industry statistics to track data on digital entrepreneurs and their evolution. This will be\ncomplemented by mixed-method analysis of the digitalization of business activities and digital\nopportunities for entrepreneurs. An updated database on digital entrepreneurs in selected DMCs\nwill be developed as a reference tool to aid in evidence-based policy-making.\n10. Output 2: Innovative research on digital entrepreneurial ecosystems promoted. This\ncomponent will analyze existing digital entrepreneurial ecosystems in Asian economies and\ncompare these against benchmarks elsewhere.13 Using qualitative and mixed methods, the TA\nteam and experts will conduct case studies of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems in Asia and an\nanalytical framework\u2014an entrepreneurial ecosystem model\u2014will be developed. Ecosystems in\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,\nSingapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam will be considered for case studies. These countries have \nsome data on digital entrepreneurship and represent a good mix of economies with differing \nincome levels. Then the TA team and experts will analyze and compare the cases with successful \nentrepreneurial ecosystems elsewhere to identify and document best practices. \n11. Output 3: Knowledge sharing and capacity building on digital entrepreneurship\nstrengthened. This component will answer questions about how well policy regimes in Asian\ncountries support digital entrepreneurs and nurture digital entrepreneurial ecosystems.14 The TA\nteam and experts will track digital scale-up firms , databases, interview data, and online archives\nand contextualize prevailing policy regimes and entrepreneurial frameworks to benchmark the\npolicies  of  selected  Asian  countries  .  The  TA  team  will  organize  virtual  workshops  and\nconferences  to  share  knowledge,  experiences,  and  lessons.  Knowledge  products  will  be\ndisseminated mainly via digital publications, but printed copies will be made available upon\nrequest, especially for those with limited internet access.\n12. The TA team will develop, promote and mainstream innovative knowledge products and\nservices to maximize development impacts in DMCs. Commissioned papers, upon review, will be\npublished as online working papers. The TA team will also publish an executive report on the\nresearch outputs and its key contents distilled into policy briefs, blogs, and social media items to\nreach a wider audience and generate greater impact. The TA team will actively disseminate the\ngenerated data and knowledge to policy makers, researchers, ADB departments, and other\nstakeholders in the form of virtual conferences, workshops, and outreach. The continuity and\nsustainability of the TA knowledge solutions will be secured through their effective absorption into\n12 Five research papers will (i) take stock of the state of digital entrepreneurship in Asia, (ii) perform cross-country \nempirical analysis of links between institutions and governance and digital entrepreneurship, (iii) perform cross-country \nanalysis of the influence of ICT infrastructure on digital entrepreneurship, and (iv) perform two firm-level empirical \nanalyses of the drivers of digital entrepreneurship using DMC firm-level data. \n13 Five research papers will (i) analyze two case studies of successful entrepreneurial ecosystems in DMCs, (ii) examine \none case study of digital entrepreneurship among the poor in a DMC, and (ii) perform two firm-level analyses \nof the drivers of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems in DMCs. \n14 Two research papers will identify key national and local policies for promoting digital entrepreneurship.

In delivering the above-mentioned outputs, the TA team will work together with leading\nexperts. The TA team will consider collaboration with the Republic of Korea\u2019s Center for Economic \nCatch-Up (CEC), which conducts academic and policy-oriented research on economic catch-up \nand innovation. Other possible collaborators include Imperial College London (UK), Wuhan \nUniversity (PRC), United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia (UNESCAP), and \nAsia School of Business (Malaysia). Collaboration with other ADB departments and synergies \nwith other ADB projects will be actively explored to cross-fertilize generated knowledge and jointly \nsupport DMCs in policy formulation and reforms.15 \nC. Cost and Financing\n14. The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the\nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (EAKPF) and administered by ADB.\nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.\n15. The following are ineligible items under the EAKPF: (i) civil works, (ii) procurement of\nlarge-scale equipment, (iii) permanent staffing costs, and (iv) the hiring of staff consultants.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n16. ADB will administer the TA. ERCD will be responsible for selection, supervision, and\nmanagement of consultants; procurement; and accomplishment, monitoring, and evaluation of\nthe outputs. ERCD will provide staff to act as resource persons in workshops and conferences.\nTo conduct the studies, collaboration with institutional bodies or universities may be explored.
