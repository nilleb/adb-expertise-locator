During the 2007 Country Review Programming Mission and water financing conferences \nheld in September 2006 and March 2007, the Government of Viet Nam requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)\u2019s assistance in preparing the Hue Water Supply Project, which was \nfirst identified during a reconnaissance mission for potential public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) \nin 2005. Viet Nam is one of the five target countries for ADB\u2019s Water Financing Program  \n2006\u20132010, which aims to double ADB lending in the water and sanitation sector by 2010. The \nproposed project will address the provision of a sustainable supply of potable water in the short \nand medium term for Thua Thien Hue Province in the Central Region. The proposed project is \ndirectly linked to the agenda of supporting infrastructure development and PPPs in infrastructure \nin the Central Region to alleviate migration pressure on Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, as set out \nin the country strategy and program for 2007\u20132010.1 The proposed project also contributes to \nGoal 7 of the Millennium Development Goals (to ensure environmental sustainability), Target 10 \n(to reduce the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water), and the \ncorresponding Viet Nam Development Goals. \n2.  A  fact-finding  mission  visited  Thua  Thien  Hue  Province  in  May  2007  for  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA). Agreement between the mission and the Province \nwas reached on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for the PPTA. The design and monitoring framework2 is \nprovided in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Despite a relatively low level of urban population compared to other Asian countries,3 \nViet  Nam  is  facing  important  urban  challenges,  and  water  and  sanitation  issues  figure \nprominently. About 26 million people live in urban and peri-urban areas, and the total urban \npopulation is expected to double by 2020. In 2006, only 60% of urban residents had access to \npiped water that met national standards.4 Although cities and towns account for more than 70% \nof total economic output, the development of water services has not kept pace with economic \ngrowth. Moreover, in 2002, water coverage was only 11% in small towns, compared to 67% in \nlarge cities.  \n4.  Following enactment of Decree No. 117/2007/ND-CP of 11 July 2007, the water and \nsanitation5 sector  in  Viet  Nam  is  undergoing  a  significant  transition.  This  new  legislation \nchanges  the  definition  of  water  as  a  social  good  to  water  as  a  commercial  good.  The \nGovernment is enforcing equitization6 of water companies into joint stock entities, which will be \nincorporated as fully commercial operations. Some companies are expected to be listed on the \nstock exchange as initial public offerings. Full cost recovery is also a key component of the \nlegislation, and water tariffs have been rising since its introduction.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program, Viet Nam, 2007\u20132010. Manila. \n2  The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 April 2008. \n3  In Viet Nam, the urban population was only 25%, compared with 37% in the People\u2019s Republic of China and 42% \nin Indonesia. \n4  World Bank. 2005. World Bank Infrastructure Strategy 2005. Washington, DC. \n5  Similar legislation exists in wastewater, drainage, and solid waste. \n6  A privatization process, in which provincial state-owned water companies are corporatized and incorporated into \ncompanies with shares.  \n ", "2   \n5.  Under the Water Financing Program 2006\u20132010, ADB is preparing several urban water \nsupply projects\u2014like the proposed project\u2014which will: (i) draw lessons from project preparation \nand implementation to define a capacity-building program to strengthen operations and improve \nservice delivery; and, (ii) in consultation with the Government, develop and adopt a model for \nsustainable lending to the water and sanitation sector. Simultaneously, ADB is coordinating with \nother donors active in Viet Nam\u2019s water supply and sanitation sector. In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh \nCity, the World Bank is preparing and implementing water projects in parallel with ADB. In other \noperations, the World Bank is shifting its focus from project lending to sector lending through \nlocal government investment funds. In Da Nang, where ADB is also developing a water supply \nproject, and also in Ho Chi Minh City, the Government of the Netherlands is financing service \ncontracts and twinning arrangements with Dutch operators. The World Bank and the Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (JBIC) are also implementing several urban environment \nprojects, which include wastewater and sanitation components. Finally, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement is working through a sector approach with the Viet Nam Development Bank for \nits Mekong Water Supply and Sanitation Project. \n6.  Thua Thien Hue Province has an area of 5,054 square kilometers and a population of \n1,136,400  distributed  over  seven  districts  and  one  city,  which  are  further  split  into  150 \ncommunes and wards. Thua Thien Hue Water Supply Company (TTHWSC), one of the best \nperforming water companies in Viet Nam, was established in 1909 and is responsible for water \nsupply to Hue City and other districts. As of 2005,7 TTHWSC had about 523 persons working in \nwater operations, corresponding to an average of 8.2 staff per 1,000 connections. TTHWSC \nmanages 12 water production and treatment companies,8 with a total capacity of over 105,000 \ncubic meters per day (cmd) and over 63,000 connections\u2014all metered. The water supply \ncoverage reaches 97% of Hue City, but is only between 3% and 40% for all the other districts, \ndue to low population density in mountainous areas, resulting in an average provincial water \nsupply coverage of below 45%. TTHWSC has annual revenues of about $3.5 million, and its \naverage water tariff of $0.20 per cubic meter is well below the national average. With an \nexcellent operating ratio of 0.47, demonstrating the high operational efficiency, the low level of \noperation expense, and the impressive nonrevenue water at only 15%, TTHWSC operates in a \npositive cashflow environment. It has recently accelerated its collection program, with the result \nthat the collection ratio is above 100%, indicating a collection of arrears. TTHWSC now needs to \nprovide more water to its consumers and expand coverage to unserved households. \n7.  TTHWSC plans to double water supply coverage by 2015 through a modern operation \nand to deliver water in a sustainable manner. To achieve these objectives, TTHWSC is seeking \nassistance to finance two physical components: (i) additional production capacity of 125,000 \ncmd,  and  (ii)  strengthening  and  extension  of  the  primary  transmission  and  secondary \ndistribution network to increase provincial water supply coverage from 45% to over 75%. The \nestimated cost of these investments is about $43 million. In addition, TTHWSC has requested \nassistance with defining a comprehensive institutional strengthening program to (i) develop a \nframework  for  PPPs  and  private  sector  participation  to  assist  TTHWSC  in  its  equitization \nprocess;  (ii)  enhance  quality  assurance  through  certification  under  the  International \nOrganization for Standardization (ISO), resulting in a strengthening of operations and improved \nservice delivery; and (iii) define a policy for water conservancy and energy efficiency that will \nsupplement the Government\u2019s focus and assist TTHWSC in preparing investments that will \naddress these issues. \n                                                 \n7  Data extracted from the Continuous Improvement Benchmarking from 2005 (ADB. 2007.

Hue City suffers from annual flooding and emerging domestic pollution in city canals and \nthe Huong River, which passes through the city. Outside Hue City, households rely on onsite \nsanitation systems. JBIC is starting a feasibility study for sanitation and drainage in Hue City \nand will implement a centralized sewerage system, with the construction of combined sewers \nand a secondary treatment plant. Its proposed project will also develop a city drainage facility \nand include dredging canals in the city\u2019s southern area, which is most prone to flooding. In the \nother part of the Province, households mostly rely on communal or onsite sanitation.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the proposed project will be improved urban livability in Thua Thien Hue \nProvince through development of water supply infrastructure and the sustainable provision of \npotable water. \n10.  The PPTA will examine the constraints that impact service delivery and the sustainability \nof water operations in Thua Thien Hue Province and will make recommendations on addressing \nthem. The outcome of the PPTA will be the agreed design of a project that will increase the level \nand sustainability of water service through a combination of new investments in production \ncapacity, strengthening, and extension of the distribution network, as well as an institutional \nstrengthening program. An initial poverty reduction and social analysis for the project is provided \nin Appendix 2. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The PPTA will prepare a project to be implemented in three parts, as set out below.  \n(i)  Part I: Production. The PPTA will examine the current and near-future water \ndemand  in  the  province\u2019s  seven  districts  and  one  city  and  confirm  the \nrequirement for additional capacity. The output will be a feasibility study that \nidentifies and prepares project components suitable for ADB financing, including \na water production plant of 125,000 cmd capacity. The PPTA will also prepare \noptions for water supply for remote or isolated communities in the province. \n(ii)  Part II: Transmission and distribution network. Based on the objective to \nachieve 75% water supply coverage in the province, the PPTA will prepare a \nfeasibility study for about 326 kilometers (km) of transmission network and about \n950 km of distribution and service network. The PPTA will also develop cost \neffective solutions that promote autonomous water supply for these communities \nwith associated sanitation. \n(iii)  Part III: Institutional strengthening. The PPTA will: (a) define a framework for \nPPPs and private sector participation, especially regarding the equitization and \nthe delegated management or lease of the operation and maintenance activities \nof TTHWSC; (b) finalize the financing plan and the funding requirement and \ndefine TTHWSC\u2019s financing baseline and its capacity to borrow; (c) define a \npolicy  for  water  conservation  through  demand  management  and  review  the \nscheduling  of  water  production  projects;  (d)  design  a  strategy  for  energy \nefficiency through an energy audit and a prioritized investment plan based on \ncost  recovery  for  possible  ADB  financing;  and  (e)  define  the  framework  for \n ", "4   \noptimizing the provision and the delivery of water supply services during the \nensuing project of ISO certification.9 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1,700,000 equivalent. The PPTA will be financed \non a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership Facility and \nadministered by ADB in the amount of $1,500,000. The Government will fund the remaining \n$200,000 equivalent through in-kind contributions of (i) office space for a maximum of 20 \nconsultants and access to international telephone and internet services;10 (ii) logistical support; \nand (iii) counterpart staff to support the consultants and benefit from practical experience and \nknowledge transfer, including support for surveys to confirm resettlement data and any other \nessential  information  that  may  be  identified  during  the  PPTA.  The  Government  has  been \ninformed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. A \ndetailed cost estimate is provided in Appendix 3. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  According  to  Decree  No.  131/2006/ND-TTg,  Thua  Thien  Hue  Provincial  People's \nCommittee will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the PPTA with overall project responsibility. \nThe EA will establish a project management unit, which will be suitably staffed for the duration \nof the PPTA implementation with a full-time director, an English-speaking coordinator, and two \nto five counterpart personnel. The project management unit will be responsible for the day-to-\nday collaboration with the PPTA consultants, other government agencies, and TTHWSC, and \nwill coordinate with the private sector, civil society, water users, and other stakeholders. A \nsteering committee composed of representatives from relevant agencies of the Thua Thien Hue \nProvincial People's Committee and other stakeholders will meet at least every 3 months to (i) \nreview  the  progress  of  the  PPTA,  and  (ii)  provide  strategic  direction  for  the  selection  of \ninvestment proposals and the related financing plans. \n14.  The PPTA will be implemented over a period of 9 months from July 2008 to March 2009. \nTotal  consulting  inputs  will  be  about  95  person-months,  consisting  of  13  international \nconsultants for 31 person-months and 13 national consultants for 64 person-months. The scope \nof work is broadly as follows (outline terms of reference are provided in Appendix 4). \n  (i)  Project investment. This task will be implemented over 9 months, to define and \nprepare Parts I and II of the PPTA (refer to para.11), including environmental and \nsocial  safeguards  and  financial  and  economic  analyses  to  meet  ADB \nrequirements, and two local feasibility studies to meet the Government's approval \nrequirements. It is anticipated that 27 person-months of international and 60 \nperson-months of national consultant services will be required for this part. \n  (ii)  Institutional strengthening. This task will be implemented over the duration of \nthe PPTA and cover Part III of the PPTA (refer to para. 11). The consultants \n(about 4 person-months international and 4 person-months national) will work \nclosely with TTHWSC in defining the needs and requirements for the institutional \nstrengthening program to be implemented as part of the ensuing project. \n                                                 \n9  Certification under: (i) ISO 9001 for all design, operation, and maintenance activities; (ii) ISO 14001 for safety and \nenvironment; (iii) ISO 18001 for occupational health and safety in the operation; and (iv) the new ISO 24512 for the \nmanagement of drinking water utilities. \n10 The PPTA consultants will pay for communication costs. \n ", "  5\n15.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB as (i) an international firm in association with a \nlocal firm, recruited under fixed budget selection through simplified technical proposals; and (ii) \nindividual consultants, as required, with the contingencies. Fixed budget selection is appropriate \nsince the PPTA is limited to the production of two simple feasibility studies and an institutional \nstrengthening program with detailed terms of reference, input consultant time, and deliverables. \nThe firm and the individual consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Equipment will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All the \nequipment purchased under the PPTA will be turned over to the EA at the end of the project. \n16.  The  PPTA  will  include  three  workshops  in  Hue  City  to  increase  stakeholders\u2019 \nparticipation in discussing the investment proposals and ensure good dissemination of the \nproposed project components. The first workshop will be the kick-off workshop, the second \nworkshop will be during the PPTA\u2019s midterm review, and the last workshop will be held at the \nsubmission of the draft final report. \n17.  Reporting  requirements  for  the  consultants  will  include:  an  inception  report,  three \nprogress reports, and a final report. In addition, the consultants will prepare a feasibility study \nreport for the investment component of the project, and a series of reports for each of the items \nunder the institutional strengthening program. All documents, including administrative reports, \nwill be produced in English and in Vietnamese. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n18.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to the Government of Viet Nam to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility for preparing the Hue Water Supply Project. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicatorsa  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nTo provide better water  Provincial water supply  Benchmarking report from  \u2022  General political and \nsupply infrastructure  coverage increases  South East Asian Water  socioeconomic \nand sustainable  from 45% to over 75%.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nProject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \nThe country strategy and program for 2007\u20132010 stresses the importance of maintaining sustainable equitable economic \ngrowth to achieve further reductions in poverty. Viet Nam\u2019s success in reducing the share of the population living below the \npoverty line (from 70% in 1990 to 27% in 2005) was based on rapid but equitable economic growth. The proposed project \naddresses the sustainable water supply for the short and medium term for Thua Thien Hue Province in the Central Region. \nThe proposed project is directly linked to the agenda of assisting and supporting infrastructure development and public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure in the Central Region to alleviate migration pressure on Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, from \nthe country strategy and program for 2007\u20132010. In addition, the proposed project will include an institutional strengthening \nprogram to assist TTHWSC to improve its efficiency and service. These measures will ultimately improve the quality of life, \nworking environment, ability to attract investment into the city, and access to services, and will therefore help to reduce \npoverty. The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy will be reviewed to identify the impact of such large-scale infrastructure \nprojects on poverty reduction in Viet Nam. \nB.  Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention;   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);   Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification: \nThe proposed project will look at improving service delivery and expanding coverage in Thua Thien Hue Province, which does \nnot meet the criteria for TI-G classification set in the Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis (2001), which is to have a \nsignificantly higher poverty incidence than the national average. \nC.

If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \nThe water tariff structure will be pro-poor and focus on providing the urban poor, vulnerable, and disadvantaged populations \nwith access to services and will use a citizen report card to measure the services. \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \nThe objective of the proposed project is to enable TTHWSC to increase coverage for water supply from 45% to over 75%. The \nproject will directly benefit people living in the province and improve the level of service to all users. The tariff includes a \nsubsidized \u201clifeline\u201d of 4 cubic meters of water per person per month, including the connection cost, to promote access and the \nuse of the service by vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the province. \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nThe project will provide affordable and clean water to prospective users, such as households, industries, commerce, and \ninstitutions (e.g., hospitals and public buildings). \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \nBlock tariffs and access to service are known to be counterproductive with the poorest segment of the urban population. The \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nproject team will work with TTHWSC and the people's committee to incorporate the one-off cost of accessing the service into \nthe water tariff. Miscellaneous programs, such as output-based aid and \"small pipe networks\", will be examined and \nconsidered for inclusion in the proposed project. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \nStakeholders include the water users, TTHWSC, and the local government. \n2.  What  type  of  C&P  is  required  during  the  PPTA  or  project  processing  (e.g.,  workshops,  community  mobilization, \ninvolvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \nThere will be several public consultation meetings over the course of project preparation, including three workshops, a \nresettlement town hall meeting, willingness to pay and affordability surveys, and a water tariff public consultation. The \nproposed project would strengthen TTHWSC\u2019s customer service department and its management of user complaints, and \ndevelop a plan addressing communication between TTHWSC and users. \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n          Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?  \n          Yes      No    Please explain.  \nA C&P plan will be prepared by the PPTA consultant during the social assessment survey and focus groups discussions to \nseek the views from the project population. The C&P plan will be used in formulating a communication plan for disseminating \ninformation between TTHWSC and the users and in defining performance indicators to measure the level of service through \nthe citizen report card. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector8 that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nThe consultants will conduct a detailed gender assessment for the households affected by resettlements. A gender plan for \naddressing gender concerns in the proposed project related to resettlement, HIV/AIDS, safety measures, and capacity building of \nthe EA and relevant stakeholders will be prepared. The communication plan will be gender focus to promote and build \nawareness. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision making?  \n          Yes          No    Please explain. \nThe proposed Project will not directly lead to women's empowerment; however, the improved services and the expansion of the \ndistribution network will benefit women through improved access to a potable water supply. \n \n3.  Could the proposed Project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No    Please explain. NA. \n \n \nIII.

Feasibility Study \n3.  The consultants will implement a feasibility study over 9 months to (i) design the project \ncomponents for increased water production and coverage of the transmission, distribution, and \nservice network in the province; and (ii) prepare a support matrix for the provision of autonomous \nwater supply and sanitation systems for remote locations. The consultants will also prepare all the \nnecessary safeguard documents, including social assessment, financial and economic analyses, \nproject implementation plan, and procurement plan. The estimated inputs for the feasibility study \nare  27  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  about  60  person-months  of  national \nconsultants. \n4.  The study\u2019s scope will include the activities listed as follows. \n(i)  Information on the existing situation and services provided will be detailed, including: \n(a)  existing services, e.g., the water supply, wastewater, and drainage; \n(b)  the current situation with regard to population and services available; \n(c)  site conditions, focusing on those likely to impact project construction, such \nas soil condition and flooding potential; \n(d)  the scope of the proposed project and the total investment; and \n(e)  project rationale, showing the increase in coverage and access to water \nsupply. \n(ii)  Planning  and  demand  forecasting  for  future  development  will  be  conducted, \nincluding: \n  (a)  reviewing and commenting on the existing water supply master plan; \n(b)  developing a demand forecast model for a 10-year period with links to 2 \nyears of historical information, and ensuring consistency with the financial \nmodel (refer to para. 6); and  \n(c)  establishing current and future water supply demand figures for each district \nand  Hue  City.  The  consultants  will  investigate  how  the  supply  to  all \nconsumers can be separately metered, and how consumers will be billed for \nwater consumed.  \n(iii)  Technical requirements for future development in wastewater and water supply will \nbe outlined, including: \n(a)  how staging of the treatment plant can be achieved to correspond with the \ndemand forecast and how treated water from the plant will comply with \nVietnamese national standards; \n  (b)  how the design of the network system will suit demand projections for staged \ndevelopment; \n(c)  a process flow chart and full details on control system implementation; \n(d)  a list of all major equipment and construction materials required for the water \nsupply  system,  which  will  form  the  basis  for  the  preparation  of  the \nconstruction cost estimate; and \n(e)  liaising with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)-financed \nwastewater  project  to  examine  provision  of  wastewater  management  in \nareas not covered by the JBIC project. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  15 \n5.  Institutional  Assessment.  The  consultants  will  prepare  a  detailed  description  of  the \nproposed project\u2019s city, districts, and communes. This will include descriptions of current and/or \nplanned future organizational setups and regulatory responsibilities, focusing on fiscal policies and \nmunicipal finance, municipal and urban planning, development of urban infrastructure, construction \noversight, water resource management, water companies, environmental regulations relevant to \nurban  infrastructure,  and  pricing  regulations.  Other  matters  to  be  considered  will  be  tariffs, \nconnection fees and subsidy policies, corporate charters and bylaws, and ownership of TTHWSC \nand financial relations with supervising authorities (e.g., transfer of bills collected or profit and/or \nloss sharing arrangements). \n6.  Financial  and  Fiscal  Assessment.  The  consultants  will  describe  the  current  and  \nnear-future  fiscal  situation  of  TTHWSC  and  the  province,  including  breakdown  of  revenues, \nfinancing, and expenditures, highlighting key policy issues such as priority investment areas or \nspecial  purpose  vehicles.  The  consultants  will  conduct  a  financial  management  capacity \nassessment of TTHWSC and propose a financial management system. The consultants will also \nfinalize financial and economic analyses of the proposed project components, according to the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) latest guidelines for the financial management and analysis of \nprojects.1 To facilitate the analysis of the water company, the consultants will develop a financial \nmodel that produces the needed forecasts over a 12-year operational period, with links to a \nminimum  of  3  years  of  historical  information.  The  financial  model  will  separate  assumptions, \ncalculations,  and  outputs  (i.e.,  reports)  and  will  be  presented  as  a  separate  paper  and  a \ncomputerized model, with all major assumptions and calculations documented and discussed. The \nfinancial analysis will address a 10-year operational period; considerations will include the cost of \nchemicals, power consumption, and the design life of equipment used, as well as any associated \nfinancial costs. \n7.  Assessment of Tariffs. The water supply tariffs and tariff structure will be reviewed and \nanalyzed. Detailed tariff assumptions will be a part of the financial model and include tariffs for \nwater and wastewater.  \n8.  Economic Analysis. The consultants will prepare an analysis of the economic costs and \nbenefits of the project. Economic analyses will follow ADB's guidelines for the economic analysis of \nwater supply projects.2 \n9.  Environmental  Safeguards. The proposed project has been classified as category B, \nsince it is expected that most of the project components selected will have minimal impact on the \nenvironment. Therefore, the consultants will prepare category B project components and produce \nan initial environmental examination and summary according to ADB's Environment Policy (2002), \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and  the  Operations  Manual  section  on  the \nenvironment.3 \n10.  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous People. The consultants will review the initial \nresettlement classification for each of the selected proposed project components and finalize \nsafeguard compliance for resettlement. It is expected that most of the project components selected \nwill be category A, and that a full resettlement plan will be required. The full resettlement plan will \nfollow ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), guided by the Operations Manual section \non involuntary resettlement,4 and other relevant ADB policies and guidelines, e.g., Handbook on \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005.

The consultants will manage the field surveys on inventory losses and census as well as a \nsocioeconomic survey to profile the proposed project area and the social and poverty impact, \nwhich will serve as the baseline assessment and reference for impact surveys conducted upon \ncompletion and after several years of operation. If the social analysis determines that ethnic \nminorities are present in the proposed project area and (i) are likely to be affected by the project \nbecause of land acquisition and/or resettlement, or (ii) are disadvantaged or vulnerable because of \ntheir social or cultural identity, a combined ethnic minority development and resettlement plan will \nbe prepared or ethnic minority-specific actions undertaken to address the concerns of ethnic \nminorities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. The social assessment will also \naddress matters such as ethnic minorities, urban poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable persons, and \ntheir ability to afford and willingness to pay for the new and improved services. The consultants will \ntake the findings of the report into account in assessing water demand. \n11.  The consultants will prepare an implementation and procurement plan, which will define the \nfollowing. \n(i)  Administrative  arrangements  and  financial  management  capacity.  The \nconsultants will detail the administrative arrangements and assess the financial \nmanagement capacity of TTHWSC to implement the proposed project.  \n(ii)  Organizational  structure.  The  organizational  structure  for  management  and \ndelivery  of  the  proposed  project  will  be  outlined,  showing  responsibilities  and \nreporting guidelines. \n(iii)  Implementation plan. The consultants will outline a tentative timetable for project \nimplementation. This will show the various stages of implementation, including (a) \nfeasibility study and design, (b) bidding and procurement, and (c) construction of the \nproject. The plan will outline the reporting and approval process at various stages, \nand  the  proposed  arrangements  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  project \nimplementation. \nC.  Institutional Strengthening Program \n12.  The institutional strengthening program will be implemented over 6 months, in parallel to \nthe  feasibility  study,  and  will  require  4  person-months  of  international  consultant  services, \nsupported by 4 person-months of national consultant services. The program will define a series of \nproposals  or  policy  dialogues  for  discussion  and  evaluation  by  TTHWSC  and  by  the  project \nsteering committee, to be implemented under the ensuing project. In addition, the private sector \nparticipation specialist will have at least 10 years of operation and maintenance expertise at a \nsenior management level in a private or public\u2013private company. \n(i)  Energy efficiency. An international energy savings specialist (1 person-month) will \nsupervise energy audits for each of up to 15 locations (e.g., pumping stations, \ntreatment  plants,  and  headquarters)  and  finalize  recommendations  for  energy \nsavings and energy efficiency. The audits will be performed by a national firm with \nmore than 5 years of experience in this type of work, and with the necessary \nresources, material, and equipment. \n(ii)  Water conservancy: An international water conservancy specialist (1 person-month) \nsupported by a national consultant (1 person-month) will review the current policies \n ", "Appendix 4  17 \nof TTHWSC and the province pertaining to water conservation and propose a series \nof measures for water conservation, with a budget and schedule. \n(iii)  Certification. An International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification \nspecialist (1 person-month) supported by a national consultant (1 person-month) will: \n(a) review the ISO 9001 certification already obtained by TTHWSC; (b) assess \nreadiness to comply with ISO 14001 and ISO 18001 for environmental protection \nand  safety  and  with  ISO  24512  for  the  management  of  water  utilities;  and  (c) \npropose a certification program with a budget and schedule. \n(iv)  Private  sector  participation.  It  is  expected  that  according  to  Decree  No. \n117/2007/ND-CP,  TTHWSC  will  be  listed  as  a  joint  stock  company  under  a  \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP). An international PPP consultant (1 person-month) \nsupported by a national consultant (2 person-months) will prepare options for this \nlisting process, focusing on private sector participation. The consultants will also \nreview  the  asset  inventory  and  management  system  in  place  and  propose  an \nimplementation program for asset management. \nD.  Deliverables \n13.  Reports  will  be  prepared  in  English  and  translated  into  Vietnamese  to  facilitate \nunderstanding  and  decision-making  by  the  Government.  Reports  will  be  submitted  in  both \nelectronic and paper form. All data and analyses will be consolidated and provided in electronic \nform. There are three workshops planned to present and discuss the status of the study, the scope \nof the investment, and the proposed institutional and financial arrangements for the project\u2019s \nsustainability. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080523155607+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Keywords": "tar: vietnam 41071, hue water supply project, netherlands trust fund, water financing partnership facility, sustainable economic growth,water supply,sanitation,waste management,water supply sanitation", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0.1 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080618152303+08'00'", "Title": "Preparing the Hue Water Supply Project (Financed by the Netherlands Trust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership Facility)"}, "author_page": " \n \nVice President  C.
