INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Department of \nPersonnel and Training (DOPT) of the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions to \nbuild institutional capacity and systems to implement the integrated government online training \n(iGOT) scheme for training government officials in India. The TA scope includes developing and \nimplementing an intelligent learning management system (LMS), developing and administering \n10 e-learning modules of the selected subjects on a pilot basis, and putting in place guidelines for \nscaling  up  the  LMS  and  e-learning  modules  by  the  DOPT.  The  proposed  LMS  will  have \nmultidevice access capability (desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet, and smartphone) to \nenable remote and on-time learning by government officials. This approach will enable the DOPT \nto  train  more  staff  using  technology-enabled  learning  methods  blended  with  conventional \nclassroom training, thereby saving time and money. The TA is in line with the priority in the country \npartnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ncapacity building to project implementing agencies.1 The TA is not included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan for India, 2018\u20132020.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  India has grown at an average rate of more than 7% since 2012, which places it among \nthe  world\u2019s  fastest-growing  large  economies.  The  rapid  growth  has  been  accompanied  by \nnumerous measures to remove the structural bottlenecks and improve the investment climate. \nThe government envisages India being a $3 trillion economy in 2019 and growing rapidly to reach \n$5  trillion  in  the  next  few  years.  To  accelerate  inclusive  economic  growth  and  structural \ntransformation,  the  country  needs  to  address  the  remaining  impediments  and  emerging \nchallenges, such as (i) building economic competitiveness, (ii) resolving infrastructure bottlenecks, \n(iii)  closing the  widening  gap  between  advanced  and  lagging  regions,  and (iv)  addressing \nworsening environmental degradation. Building institutional capacities of government institutions, \nparticularly in lagging regions, is key to meeting these objectives. \n \n3.  Within the government, the DOPT is mandated under the National Training Policy 2012 to \ncater to the capacity development needs of the three tiers of government (national, state, and \nlocal). However, its current approach in creating capacity and a knowledge base has been \ncentered largely around traditional classroom-style knowledge-sharing training programs. This \ntraditional method faces several problems, such as limited outreach to targeted officials and high \nadministrative costs such as staff travel and per diems. At present, domestic and foreign trainings \ncan cover only a small proportion of mostly senior officials. As a result, there is inadequate \ncoverage of training programs for professional staff who are responsible for leading or undertaking \nplanning, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of various development schemes, \naffecting timely, efficient, and quality implementation of those schemes. \n \n4.  Recent technological advancements have opened up a range of information-technology-\nbased options, such as e-learning, for creating capacity and knowledge more efficiently and \neffectively. Tapping the opportunity, the DOPT has launched a new scheme\u2014iGOT\u2014under which \nthe department intends to develop an LMS to offer e-learning modules targeted at professional \ncivil servants working in operational leadership. The purpose of the iGOT scheme is to increase \n \n1  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2018\u20132022\u2014Accelerating Inclusive Economic Transformation. \nManila. \n2  The vice-president of Operations 1 approved the TA concept paper on 22 August 2019. The TA first appeared in the \nbusiness opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 September 2019. The purpose, scope, implementation \narrangements, costs, and financing arrangements were confirmed by the DOPT on 26 September 2019. \n ", "2 \nthe access to new information, knowledge, and operationally relevant training programs for \ninstitutional capacity building. This is in line with the government\u2019s flagship program, Digital India, \nwhich aims to improve public service delivery using digital platforms. \n \n5.  The proposed TA aims to prioritize training topics relevant to development schemes such \nas procurement, contract management, construction management, and project evaluation and \nappraisal, as well as important crosscutting subjects such as new technologies, data analytics, \ninformation  technology  tools  in  governance,  and  the  government\u2019s  office  administrative \nprocedures. ADB has pioneered the establishment of quality training systems of these project \nimplementation-related subjects under the Capacity Development Resource Center (CDRC) that \nwas established in ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission jointly with the Department of Economic Affairs \n(DEA). The TA will use the developed CDRC materials and knowledge base as references to \ndevelop LMS e-learning systems under the iGOT scheme. The TA will help institutionalize and \ndisseminate the training systems which were developed under the CDRC into the government\u2019s \ntraining systems. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: access to training increased.3 The TA will \nhave the following outcome: access to e-learning training modules for civil servants increased.4 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  Output  1.  Implementation  of  integrated  government  online  training  scheme \nsupported. This output comprises the following specific components. Seventy five percent of TA \nresources are allocated to output 1. \n \n(i)  Integrated  government  online  training  scheme.  The  TA  will  support  the \nimplementation of the iGOT scheme by developing an LMS designed to deliver e-\nlearning modules and imparting e-training to eligible officials. It will also aim to \ndevelop 10 e-learning modules on a pilot basis. The proposed LMS will have a \nmodular structure with the ability to add additional functionalities in the future. \nSome of the core features of the LMS, which will be developed under the TA, \ninclude user management and administration; content development; design and \ndevelopment of 10 e-learning modules; publishing e-learning modules; online \ndelivery of e-learning modules through laptop computer, desktop computer, and \nmobile and/or tablet platforms; tracking learner progress; a robust assessment \nmechanism; reports; and analytics. \n(ii)  Training needs assessment framework. A training needs assessment (TNA) \nframework will be prepared for the conduct of a detailed TNA in 2\u20133 departments \nof the government, as a basis for future development of additional e-learning \nmodules  and  expansion  of  LMS  functionalities  to  host  these  supplementary \nmodules.  This  will  enable  the  DOPT to  develop  a  plan  for  taking  the  iGOT \nimplementation to the next level by adding both newer modules and larger learner \nand user groups. The additional features, which would be added in later phases, \n \n3  Government of India, Department of Personnel and Training. 2011.Strategy and Strategic Plan 2010\u20132015. New \nDelhi. \n4  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \ninclude a TNA, identifying topics based on a TNA, accumulating credits and linking \ncredits  to  career  profiling  of  a  civil  servant  in  the  existing  human  resource \nmanagement system, and a feedback system to the instructors. \n(iii)  Launching the learning management system. The LMS will be launched on an \nexisting government-approved cloud service provider or a dedicated high-capacity \nserver to be set up at the DOPT or an already existing LMS platform available in \nthe  open  market,  depending  on  the  security,  cost,  scalability,  and  ease  of \nmanagement. \n(iv)  Institutional collaboration arrangements. In addition to e-learning modules \ndeveloped under the TA, the LMS will provide a link to e-learning modules already \nbeing  offered  by  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  the  International  Monetary  Fund, \ngovernment agencies like the Department of Expenditure, and leading universities. \nFor  this  purpose,  the  TA  will  support  the  DOPT  to  enter  into  institutional \ncollaboration arrangements. The e-learning modules developed by ADB\u2019s India \nResident Mission CDRC will also be hosted on the LMS developed under the TA. \n(v)  Incentive program. To drive a culture for online learning, an incentive program \nwith both short- and long-term incentives will be planned. Incentives could include \nreward and recognition programs aimed at boosting enrollments, completion, and \ntop scores. \n \n8.  Output  2:  Institutional  capacity  of  the  Department  of  Personnel  and  Training \ndeveloped. The TA will support institutional development of the DOPT for making the iGOT \nscheme operational. This will focus on capacity and awareness development of DOPT staff to \nestablish robust processes in the areas of training need analysis, LMS management, quality \nassurance covering periodic validation of training modules, assessment of learning outcomes, \ncompetency  assessment  of  trainees,  content  creation,  publicity,  and  propagation.  Capacity \ndevelopment will be facilitated through (i) support to iGOT implementation through TA consultants, \n(ii) workshops conducted by national and international resource persons and institutions, and (iii) \nworkshop proceedings developed as digital tool kits and user manuals to enable the DOPT to \nconsolidate and sustain the benefits on a continual basis during future scaling up of the LMS. The \nTA will also develop an overall training strategy for the DOPT in terms of policy and institutional \nframework and implementation arrangements, including modalities of setting up a national training \nuniversity. For these purposes, expert support will be provided to the DOPT by seven individual \nconsultants. Further, support will be provided through an exposure visit to a nationally and/or \ninternationally reputed civil service training institution. The exposure visit will result in learnings \nas to how the LMS is designed and implemented, what challenges are being faced, and how they \nare addressed. Twenty two percent of TA allocation will be spent on output 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $360,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions, which is 20% of the total TA budget. The TA will cover the period of \ninitial partnership, based on which further expansion may be considered. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  The executing agency of the TA will be the DOPT. The TA activities will be administered \nby ADB through its India Resident Mission. For day-to-day administration of TA activities, a project \n ", "4 \nmanagement unit will be established headed by a director or deputy secretary of the DOPT and \nconsisting of seven DOPT staff and seven individual consultants recruited under the TA. The \nfunctions of the seven individual consultants will be carried over to the DOPT, and the project \nmanagement unit will ensure sustainability of the LMS after TA closure. The TA will facilitate \nprocurement and development of the LMS and development of e-learning modules through a firm. \nDeveloping e-learning modules and developing the LMS are considered to be nonconsulting \nservices and will be developed by a firm engaged through the request for quotation method. The \nestimated cost of procurement and development of LMS is $65,000 and cost of development of \ne-learning modules is $160,000.
