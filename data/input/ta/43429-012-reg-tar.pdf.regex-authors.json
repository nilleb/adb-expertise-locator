INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Pacific Aviation Safety Office (PASO) was established by an Asian Development \nBank (ADB) regional loan in 2005 to provide safety and security oversight to the aviation \nsector.1 The organization has 13 member countries: Australia, the Cook Islands, the Fiji Islands, \nKiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, \nTuvalu, and Vanuatu. PASO\u2019s core responsibilities are to provide oversight and advice on \n(i) aerodrome  security  and  safety,  (ii)  flight  operations,  (iii)  airworthiness  of  aircraft,  and \n(iv) personnel licensing. Overall strategy, policy, and problem resolution is provided by a Council \nof Directors that represents member governments and includes advisers from the aviation \nindustry, multilateral agencies, and established safety oversight authorities. \n \n2.  All developing member countries of PASO have acceded to the Pacific Islands Aviation \nSafety and Security Treaty, which requires regulatory harmonization. To maximize the efficiency \nand effectiveness of PASO operations and create a least-cost operating environment for airlines, \nthe legislation and regulations of member countries must be harmonized to create a common \ninspection regime and common compliance protocols. The technical assistance (TA) will assist \ndeveloping  member  countries  of  PASO  to  update  and  harmonize  their  legislation  and \nregulations. The TA will also examine the financial performance and revenue model of PASO \nwith respect to both its fee structure and member countries\u2019 aviation revenue base, and assist \nPASO to refine its management systems to ensure sustainability. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n3.  The PASO Council of Directors\u2014the governing body comprising representatives of each \nmember government\u2014has been closely involved in drafting the proposed TA through regular \nreview missions related to the ongoing project, and has agreed to the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.2 The \nproposal has also been the subject of consultations with governments and airlines through \nprevious regional TA and presentations to the Association of South Pacific Airlines; and has \nbeen coordinated closely with external agencies active in the Pacific aviation sector, including \nthe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United States Federal Aviation Agency, \nthe Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority, and the \nPacific Islands Forum Secretariat.3 The Pacific Regional Operations Business Plan, 2010\u20132013 \nemphasizes support for transport and regional cooperation and integration, both of which the TA \nwill address.4 Provision of high quality technical and policy advice by PASO is listed in the \nresults framework. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The developing member countries of PASO are signatories to international and regional \ntreaties that commit them to meeting aviation security and safety standards through the uniform \napplication of ICAO standards. In recent years, these standards have been greatly expanded, \nparticularly those related to security. However, most PASO members are unable to fully meet all \nof their oversight obligations. As a result, many Pacific island countries have received less than \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nsatisfactory results from the ICAO-mandated Universal Safety Oversight Audit Program and \nUniversal Security Oversight Audit Program. \n \n5.  Audits and inspections must be undertaken in accordance with the legal environment of \nthe state of operation, based on national regulations and the standards and recommended \npractices (SARPs) of ICAO. While improved compliance with these obligations is essential, \naviation safety and security regulatory frameworks across the region are inconsistent. Variations \nin the rules cause increased compliance costs for airlines, and make efficient implementation of \nthe  PASO  work  plan  more  challenging.  A  harmonized  operating  environment  will  produce \nbenefits to airlines, national civil aviation administrations, and travelers.  \n \n6.  Operations over the past several years have made clear the outstanding requirements \nfor regulatory improvements and the difficulties in establishing a sustainable financial base. \nPASO has undertaken field inspections and liaison with national civil aviation authorities and \nairlines, and produces annual work plans for each member country. These are not always fully \ndelivered, in part because of uncertainty over the regulatory requirements and to some extent \nowing to problems faced by some Pacific island countries in paying for services.  \n \n7.  Regulatory requirements were analyzed through preliminary TA conducted by the ICAO. \nThe work conducted included a rapid assessment of national laws and regulations, a needs \nassessment  of  potential  legal  reforms  and  technical  service  requirements,  and \nrecommendations  for  improvement.  The  assessments  were  refined  through  a  1-year \nassignment of a legal officer from the Government of Vanuatu to PASO. This preliminary work \nconfirmed the intended objectives of the TA, but member countries have struggled with the \ndetailed implementation of those recommendations. The TA will provide the necessary support \nto  finalize  the  steps  required  to  implement  the  recommendations  developed  through  both \ninitiatives. \n \n8.  To achieve sustainability, the ability of PASO to support its members depends on robust \nfinancial policies and procedures in both the organization and its member countries, which are \nstill evolving and in need of improvement. PASO services are provided on a cost recovery basis, \nwhich members have agreed to fund through a combination of subscription fees to provide base \nfunding  for  fixed  costs  and  service  fees  for  the  variable  costs  associated  with  specific \ninspections  and  other  activities.  A  sustainable  financial  model  for  members  will  require \nlegislative and regulatory authority in some countries, as well as updated administrative systems \nin PASO. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The project will increase aviation security and safety in member countries by ensuring \nthat aviation laws, regulations, technical documentation, and procedures are current, compliant \nwith ICAO  requirements, and harmonized across the region. A fragmented system will be \nreplaced with a consistent and proactive operating environment, thus improving security and \nsafety  and  reducing  costs.  It  will  create  economies  of  scale  that  allow  PASO  to  become \nfinancially self-sustaining, while lowering costs and improving service quality. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact is expected to be increased safety and security compliance rates, reduced \ncompliance costs, and increased financial sustainability of PASO. Indicators will be a reduction \n ", "  3\nin adverse safety and security audit findings, and alignment of national revenue sources to the \ncost of providing oversight.  \n \n11.  The outcome is expected to be revision and harmonization of national aviation legislation \nand regulations. Indicators will be final legal documentation that is consistent with the New \nZealand Civil Aviation Rules (NZCARs) to provide a uniform set of standards and recommended \npractices  and  inclusion  of  authority  to  raise  aviation  oversight  revenues  in  national  laws, \nexpected by the end of 2012. A third outcome indicator is legislative adoption of the revised \nlegislation and regulations, which may take a further year for all countries to achieve. \n \n12.  The  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  project  include  the  governments  of  PASO  member \ncountries that will be able to rationalize their civil aviation administrations and lower public \nsector costs, regional air transport operators that will experience lower regulatory compliance \ncosts and more responsive services, and users of air transport that will benefit from higher \nsecurity and safety standards. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The  outputs  of  the  project  will  achieve  regional  harmonization  of  aviation  legal \nframeworks  and  financial  sustainability  of  PASO  by  (i)  assisting  with  revisions  to  national \naviation  legislation  and  regulations  through  detailed  drafting  instructions,  legal  advice,  and \nmodel frameworks for each member country; (ii) ensuring that PASO member countries have \nthe ability to generate sufficient revenues for oversight through revised national financial options \nand authorizing regulations; (iii) ensuring that PASO achieves financial sustainability through \nrevised financial procedures; and (iv) conducting a comprehensive audit of PASO financial \nperformance. The TA will build on implementation of the regional loan for Establishment of the \nPacific  Aviation  Safety  Office,  which  was  approved  in  2005  and  is  closing  this  year,  and \nrepresents  the  final  support  from  ADB  to  PASO  to  consolidate  its  achievements  in  the \nparticipating countries.5 \n \n14.  Assisting with revisions to national aviation legislation and regulations will continue from \nthe base established by the review of national legislation and regulations (para. 7). The TA will \nreconfirm the detailed aspects required for revision through preparation of new or amended \nlegislative acts and rules. Two particular concerns are that national laws should provide for \nadequate delegation of authority and enforcement by civil aviation authorities (CAAs), and \nshould  be  consistent  with  international  law  instruments  which  may  require  ratification  or \naccession to ensure they are given effect in national laws. Since six of the 11 participating \ncountries have primary legislation modeled on NZCARs and will require minor updates, whereas \nthe other five will require more comprehensive legal drafting, standardizing the New Zealand \nrules provides the most efficient and effective path to harmonization. With respect to regulations, \nmost states can expect to adopt the NZCARs by reference. The TA will then prepare detailed \ndrafts of revised legal instruments based on standardized models with necessary adaptation to \nnational  circumstances.  National  legal  advisers  will  provide  extended  assistance  for  the \nadoption and adaptation of the system of aviation regulations and technical guidance material.  \n \n15.  Ensuring that participating countries can generate sufficient revenue to provide adequate \noversight is required by the principle of cost recovery for PASO services. The TA will review \nnational financial options and regulations to ensure that adequate authorization is provided to \nrecover fees. A sustainable financial model for members, which will vary by country, is likely to \n                                                 \n5 Footnote 1, page 1. \n ", "4   \ninclude some combination of passenger service charges, levies on airline tickets, authority to \ninvoice  airlines  and  airport  operators,  a  levy  on  air  traffic  management  revenue,  and \ngovernment counterpart contributions. The TA will prepare the necessary amendments of legal \ninstruments and provide assistance with implementation of a sustainable financial model in each \nparticipating country. \n \n16.  Ensuring  the  financial  sustainability  of  PASO  requires  improvements  in  the \norganization\u2019s internal financial planning and management. A previous review of PASO financial \nmanagement  that  was  conducted  in  2008  made  a  number  of  findings  related  to  financial \nplanning,  revenue  performance,  and  administrative  procedures  which  have  been  steadily \nimproving.  However,  the  PASO  Financial  Procedures  Manual  has  not  been  updated  and \ndocumentation of new procedures is incomplete. The TA will therefore assess PASO\u2019s financial \nstatus and activities, particularly budget management and expenditure control practices, and \nproduce an updated Financial Procedures Manual.  \n \n17.  Finally, conducting a comprehensive audit of PASO financial performance will ensure \nhigh  quality  independent  verification  of  PASO\u2019s  financial  status.  In  addition  to  a  standard \nfinancial audit of the organization, including a review of the 2010 financial statements, a follow-\nup  assessment  of  the  findings  of  the  2008  financial  review  will  examine  whether \nrecommendations for budget management and expenditure control have been implemented and \ndocumented.  \n \n18.  During  conduct  of  the  TA,  consultations  will be  held  with  government  and  industry \nstakeholders. To ensure ownership and cooperation, PASO will provide initial and follow-up \nbriefings and conduct training for the officials and management of the CAAs, airlines, and \nairports of member countries on the new safety and security systems and the inspection, \nsurveillance, and certification programs they require. \n \n19.  Assumptions include (i) government cooperation with legal drafting and the passage of \nlegal  amendments,  (ii)  sufficient  domestic  expertise  for  national  implementation  of \nrecommendations, and (iii) cooperation of PASO staff and availability of data. Given the long-\nstanding and active involvement of the PASO Council of Directors in planning for this TA, and \nthe high degree of cooperation by participating countries that has been achieved over several \nyears of successful operations, these assumptions are considered reasonable.  \n \n20.  Risks  include  (i)  national  legal  processes  could  be  slower  than  anticipated,  (ii) the \ncooperation of PASO staff and availability of data could be less than desirable, and (iii) PASO \nprocedures for approval could be slower than anticipated. These risks will be mitigated by the \nactive involvement of the PASO Council of Directors as the governing body, the role of the \nPASO  technical  and  finance  committees  in  guiding  implementation  of  the  TA,  and  the \nintercession of members of each body with national authorities as necessary.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-IV). The total cost of the TA is estimated at $900,000. The participating governments will \ncontribute in kind to TA implementation through access to data and documentation and support \nof counterpart staff from national CAAs and legal authorities. PASO will also contribute to TA \nimplementation through the support of its technical staff and provision of office space and \nadministrative arrangements during visiting missions. The cost estimate is in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years, from December 2010 to December 2013. ADB \nwill be the TA executing agency. Physical activities are expected to commence in March 2011. \nA  no-objection  letter  from  each  of  the  participating  countries  will  be  obtained  before  the \nimplementation of the TA in that country.  \n \n23.  The  PASO  Council  of  Directors,  comprising  directors  of  civil  aviation  from  the \nparticipating countries, has established technical and finance committees that have regularly \nreviewed the outcomes of previous TA and have met with ADB review missions semiannually \nsince approval of the associated project to discuss institutional strengthening needs. The PASO \nTechnical Committee will serve as the TA steering committee.  \n \n24.  About 27 person-months of international consulting services and 39 person-months of \nnational consulting services will be required. Consultants will be engaged for the positions of an \ninternational aviation legal specialist, a number of national legal advisers to be determined, two \ninternational  regulatory  specialists,  and  an  international  financial  management  specialist. \nConsultants will be engaged through a firm, using quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) \nprocedures with an 80:20 weighting and based on simplified technical proposals. In addition, a \nnational specialist will be engaged as an individual consultant to conduct a financial audit. All \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n25.  Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with the ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (May 2010, as amended from time to time). Participating \ngovernments and PASO will provide in-kind counterpart contributions in the form of staff time to \nsupport the TA consultants when on assignment in participating countries. This is estimated at 3 \nperson-months per country and 6 person-months for PASO. \n \n26.  ADB will monitor TA implementation through quarterly progress reports, regular review \nmissions, and consultations with the PASO Council technical and finance committees (on which \nADB is an official observer and technical adviser). Monitoring of the outcome and impact will be \nfeasible through ICAO audit reports, which are publicly available. \n \n27.  Good practices and lessons learned will be disseminated through the PASO Council \ntechnical and finance committees. Documents produced by the TA will be posted on the PASO \nwebsite. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n28.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis for \nInstitutional Strengthening for Aviation Regulation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance \nTargets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators with  Reporting Mechanisms \nBaselines \nImpact      Assumption \nPASO member countries  Adverse safety and  ICAO summary audit  Adequate safety and \nachieve increased aviation  security audit findings  reports  security oversight are \nsafety and security.   are reduced for all    provided and revised \n  11 PASO developing  PASO national audit  regulations are enforced. \nmember countries, at  reports   \nsubsequent ICAO audits    Risk  \n(schedule varies by    International requirements \ncountry).  could change and require \nBaseline: 2010  more frequent updates to \nTarget year: 2015  national laws and \n  regulations. \nAviation oversight   \nrevenues are sufficient   \nto acquire necessary \nexpertise from PASO \n(amount varies by \ncountry). \nBaseline: 2010 \nTarget year: 2015 \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nPASO member countries  National aviation safety  Government legal  Government cooperation \napply harmonized national  and security legislation  gazettes   with legal drafting and \naviation legislation and  and regulations adopted    passage of legal \nregulations.   in 11 participating  Aviation regulations of  amendments \n  countries by 2013.  participating members    \n    Risk \n  National legal processes \ncould be slower than \nanticipated \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.

Introduction and Background \n1.  The Pacific Aviation Safety Office (PASO) is an international organization founded to \nprovide aviation regulatory oversight on a collaborative regional basis. Members are Australia, \nthe Cook Islands, the Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea, \nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill provide a grant for technical assistance (TA) to create a harmonized operating environment \nfor aviation and improve financial sustainability. Consulting services are required to implement \nthe TA. \n \n2.   An aviation legal review has been conducted through TA funded on a grant basis by the \nInternational Funding Facility for Aviation Safety, administered by the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization (ICAO). Outputs included a review of national laws and regulations, a needs \nassessment of potential legal reforms, and recommendations for improvement. TA is required to \nimplement  these  recommendations,  establish  a  harmonized  regulatory  environment  in \nparticipating member countries, and improve financial management.  \n \nB.  Scope of Work \n3.  The overall goal of consulting services is increased safety and security compliance rates, \nreduced compliance costs, and increased financial sustainability of PASO. TA will be provided \nto national civil aviation administrations and PASO staff to draft and adopt legal and regulatory \nreforms. An update to financial management systems and the PASO Financial Procedures \nManual and a comprehensive audit of financial performance is also required. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n4.   The  executing  agency  for  the  TA  will  be  ADB,  which  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation. The general manager of PASO will serve as the TA coordinator. The PASO \nCouncil of Directors will serve as the project steering committee. \n \n5.  About 27 person-months of international consulting services and 39 person-months of \nnational consulting services will be required on an intermittent basis. The recruitment of a firm to \nprovide these services, using the quality- and cost-based selection process and simplified \ntechnical proposals, will be preferred. Recruitment of an individual for 3 person-months will be \nadopted for audit services. Consulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nD.  Terms of Reference for Consultants \n1.  Aviation  Legal  Specialist  and  Team  Leader  (international,  18  person-\nmonths) \n \n6.  An aviation legal specialist is required to establish the legal and regulatory basis for \nharmonization  in  each  developing  member  country  (DMC)  of  PASO.  Required  expertise \nincludes thorough familiarity with ICAO standards and recommended practices (SARPs), ability \nto  ensure  consistency  with  the  New  Zealand  Civil  Aviation  Regulations  (NZCARs), \ndemonstrated  ability  to  analyze  national  and  international  legal  frameworks,  legal  drafting \nexperience, and experience in these fields in Pacific DMCs.  \n ", "    Appendix 3  11 \n \n7.  Based  on  the  completed  initial  aviation  legal  review  of  national  legislation  and \nregulations, the specialist will draft recommended revisions to laws and regulations so that each \nPacific DMC is able to become compliant with international requirements and is able to adopt a \nharmonized regulatory environment based on the NZCARs. Specific tasks include the following: \n \n(i)  Prepare a strategy for implementing national legal and regulatory reforms in each \nparticipating country, in accordance with previously identified requirements and \nrecommendations,  to  ensure  the  highest  degree  of  harmonization  between \nPacific DMCs. \n(ii)  Draft standardized text for inclusion in national laws and regulations to enable \nrecognition  of  PASO  as  an  authorized  provider  of  regulatory  and  oversight \nservices and to enable national civil aviation administrations to adopt PASO \nrecommendations. \n(iii)  Prepare drafting instructions for amendments to national laws and regulations to \nfacilitate  the  adoption  (and  modification  where  required)  of  a  harmonized \nregulatory environment based on the NZCARs. \n(iv)  Prepare drafting instructions for amendments to national laws and regulations to \nfacilitate  the  adoption  of  revenue  measures  recommended  by  the  financial \nmanagement specialist. \n(v)  Draft standardized text for inclusion in national laws and regulations to facilitate \naccession to the Pacific Islands Civil Aviation Safety and Security Treaty for \nthose countries that are not yet parties to the treaty. \n(vi)  Provide  assistance  to  participating  governments  as  requested  to  facilitate \nenactment and entry into force of legislation and regulations. \n(vii)  Prepare  a  final  report  to  PASO  management  that  documents  all  findings, \nrecommendations, proposed processes for implementation of reforms, and actual \nchanges to laws and regulations. \n(viii)  Conduct a final workshop with PASO staff to ensure common understanding of \nall recommendations, responsibilities, and procedures for implementation. \n \n2.  Legal Advisers (national, up to 36 person-months) \n \n8.  National legal advisers, preferably with expertise or experience in aviation law, are \nrequired to assist the international consultant team with advice on specific national laws and \nprocesses.
