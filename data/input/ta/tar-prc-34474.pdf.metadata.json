INTRODUCTION\n1. The  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to take a lead role in preparing a PRC-GEF Partnership on Land\nDegradation  in  Dryland  Ecosystems,  under  Operational  Program  (OP)  12  on  Integrated\nEcosystem Management. The advisory technical assistance (TA) will build on consultations and\nexploratory work undertaken in the context of TA 3497-PRC, a small-scale TA (SSTA) carried\nout from November 2000 to March 2001.1 The Global Environment Facility (GEF) secretariat\napproved the advisory TA and a Project Development Facility \u2013 Block B (PDF-B) grant of\n$350,000 on 28 March 2001. To match these funds, the Government requested ADB to provide\nTA for development of the Partnership. This report is based on an ADB Fact-Finding Mission\nthat visited the PRC 26 March\u20134 April 2001 to confirm with the Government the objectives,\nscope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements of the TA.2\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. In March 2000, the Government endorsed the western development strategy (WDS) to\npromote  growth  and  development  in  western  PRC.3  The  strategy  emphasizes  two  main\nobjectives: (i) reduce economic disparities between the western region and other regions, and\n(ii)  ensure  sustainable  natural  resources  management.4  A  significant  factor  leading  to\ndeterioration of the environment and ecosystems in the western region is land degradation.\nLand degradation affects most provinces, while desertification is concentrated in the northern,\nnortheastern, and northwestern regions (the three north regions) lying in the arid, semiarid, and\ndry subhumid zones.5 Annual soil loss is estimated at 5 billion tons (t). Dust storms affect a wide\narea  including  Beijing.  Economic  damage  is  difficult  to  estimate,6  but  the  annual  loss  is\nsubstantial,  including  loss  of  arable  and  grazing  land,  destruction  of  roads  and  other\ninfrastructure, loss of reservoir storage capacity, and impacts of dust storms in urban areas.\n3. Much of the current land degradation is due to poor land use decisions over a long\nperiod of time, rather than climate changes or other natural factors. In the PRC, the arable land\nper capita is 0.11 hectare (ha). The shrinking arable land area and increasing demand for\nagricultural products pressure farmers to extract higher yields from their land, at the expense of\nstable  soil  structure  and  adequate  organic  matter  content,  thus  leading  to  increased  soil\nerosion.7 There is a clear connection between land degradation and poverty. Almost 90 percent\nof rural people living in poverty are located in areas suffering from soil erosion. In the arid areas,\nrapidly increasing livestock numbers exacerbate the spread of deserts. Over 90 percent of the\n                                                \n1 TA 3497-PRC: GEF Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems, for $100,000, approved on 5\nSeptember 2000.\n2 The TA first appeared in the Internet version of ADB Business Opportunities on 15 March 2001.\n3 The western region covers 12 provinces, an area of 5.4 million square kilometers (km2) (57 percent of the country)\nand 285 million residents (23.7 percent of PRC\u2019s population).\n4 TA 3468-PRC: Policy Support for PRC 2020 Project (Phase III), for $900,000, approved on 14 July 2000, is\nassisting the Government in relation to WDS.\n5 The Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) defines desertification as \u201cland degradation in arid, semi-arid, and\ndry  subhumid  areas  resulting  from  various  factors,  including  climatic  variations  and  human  activities.\u201d  The\npredominant  factor  causing  the  advance  of  desert  fronts  is  wind  erosion,  although  the  actual  causes  of\ndesertification are numerous.\n6 Ning Datong (undated. An Assessment of the Economic Losses Resulting from Land Degradation in China),\nestimated Y59.3 billion ($7.1 billion) per year, with 24.3 percent from lost farmland, 27.3 percent from nutrients lost\nin runoff, 42.2 percent in reduced reservoir functions, 5.4 percent from disrupted shipping, and 0.8 percent from\nsalinized soil.\n7 TA  1615-PRC:  Monitoring and Management of Fragile Ecosystems in Shanxi-Shaanxi-Inner Mongolia,  for\n$600,000, approved on 27 November 1991.", "2\n1.3 million square kilometers (km2) of grasslands suffer from moderate to severe degradation,\nwhile demand for meat and other livestock products is rising as urbanization and standards of\nliving increase throughout the PRC.\n4. Western PRC is rich in biodiversity and supports both Palearctic species and those\nrepresentative of more subtropical southern latitudes. The arid and semiarid zones contain no\nless than 5,000 recorded species of plants and animals, including numerous endemics. Many of\nthese species are endangered elsewhere in their range and threatened globally. Many plant\nspecies,  including  over  220  medicinal  plants  and  herbs,  grasses,  and  fruits  are  useful  to\nhumans. Western PRC has 9 of the world\u2019s 238 ecoregions considered as priority regions for\nglobal  conservation  action.8  They  harbor  outstanding  and  representative  examples  of  the\nworld's ecosystems, which the PRC is committed to protect under the Convention on Biological\nDiversity (CBD).\n5. An institutional framework exists to coordinate the activities of 17 ministries and state\ncommissions associated with efforts to combat land degradation in western PRC.9 To meet\nPRC\u2019s obligations under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD), the\nChina National Committee for the Implementation of the Convention to Combat Desertification\n(CCICCD) is serviced by a secretariat and the National Bureau to Combat Desertification,\nhoused  in  the  State  Forestry  Administration  (SFA).  The  China  National  Desertification\nMonitoring Centre, the China National Training Centre for Combating Desertification, and the\nChina National Research and Development Centre for Combating Desertification were set up in\n1996. The CCICCD has a mandate to (i) coordinate the work of various sectors combating land\ndegradation,  (ii)  develop  medium  and  long-term  action  strategies,  (iii)  prioritize  financial\nresources, (iv) approve the guidelines and policies for implementing the CCD, and (v) review\nlocal area development plans submitted by various levels of governments.\n6. Under the CCICCD, a National Action Program to Combat Desertification (CCD-NAP)\nwas drafted.10 It focuses on 265 priority counties in western PRC. The draft CCD-NAP spreads\nimplementation over three phases: 2001-2010, 2011-2030, and 2031-2050. A key objective of\nCCD-NAP in the first phase is to manage 22 million ha of degraded land by 2010. A blue book\nof  investment  programs,  submitted  in  2000  by  provincial  authorities  to  the  CCICCD  for\nconsideration  and  support  by  prospective  development  partners,  lists  24  projects  covering\npriority areas, with a total budget of $1.26 billion.\n7. Deficiencies in the CCD-NAP process and the existing institutional arrangements include\n(i)  failure  to  mainstream  CCD  objectives  within  development  strategies  and  ensure  policy\ncoordination across sectors; (ii) a focus on activities mainly within the jurisdiction of SFA, such\nas revegetating desert margins and planting shelterbelts, rather than providing an integrating\nframework  for  plans  and  programs  of  all  relevant  ministries;  (iii)  undue  emphasis  on\nachievement of top-down targets and technical solutions; (iv) insufficient coordination among\n                                                \n8 These are the Altai-Sayan Montane Forests, Middle Asian Mountains Temperate Forests and Steppe, Central\nChina Temperate Forests, Eastern Himalayan Broadleaf and Conifer Forests, Eastern Himalayan Alpine Meadows,\nTibetan Stepp, Daurian Steppe, Mekong and Salween River System, and the Yangtze River and Lakes system.\n9 State Forestry Administration, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, State Planning and Development Commission, Ministry of\nScience and Technology, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Railway, Ministry of Communication, Ministry of National\nTerritory and Natural Resources, State Environmental Protection Administration, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of\nWater Resources, People\u2019s Bank of China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Commission of Foreign Trade,\nLeading Group on Poverty, State Integrated Agricultural Development Bureau, and State Taxation Supervision\nBureau.\n10 CCICCD.

In addition, opportunities have been missed\nto achieve synergies among land degradation control, biodiversity conservation, and climate\nchange  mitigation  that  could  be  realized  through  integrated  ecosystem  management\napproaches. As a result of these deficiencies, the CCD-NAP does not yet provide an adequate\nframework for resolving inconsistencies and policy conflicts arising from sectoral plans.\n8. The Government has requested ADB to assist in formulating the PRC/GEF Partnership\nand in preparing a multisource, multisectoral country programming framework (CPF) to foster an\nenabling environment for integrated ecosystem management in the western region. The SSTA\ncompleted  in  March  2001  prepared  the  GEF  proposal  for  PDF-B  funding  and  facilitated\ncollection of background information, coordination of all relevant government agencies, and the\nstart  of  aid  agency  coordination.  During  preliminary  discussions  under  the  SSTA,  the\nGovernment and ADB agreed that the PRC-GEF Partnership should (i) tackle land degradation\nissues through an integrated, participatory, and cross-sectoral approach aimed at the root\ncauses of land degradation, and avoid the pursuit of inherently conflicting policies; (ii) evolve\neffective mechanisms to coordinate the legal/regulatory framework, policies, programs, and\nactions by various sectoral agencies and aid agencies operating in the areas of agricultural and\nrural development, land, forestry and water management, environmental protection, and finance\nand planning; and (iii) introduce appropriate and transparent monitoring and evaluation systems\nto ensure efficient use of funds and assess the outcomes and impact of efforts to combat land\ndegradation.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n9. The PRC/GEF Partnership Program seeks to (i) combat land degradation and reduce\npoverty  in  selected  ecoregions  of  national  and  global  significance;  (ii)  achieve  global\nenvironmental benefits through conservation of biodiversity and carbon sequestration; and (iii)\ngenerate  lessons  on  policies,  institutional  arrangements,  and  approaches  for  integrated\necosystem  management  for  widespread  replication  (Appendix  1).  The  TA  will  prepare,  in\naccordance with the GEF guidelines on the programmed approach (and in combination with a\nPDF-B grant from GEF11), (i) the CPF outlining the policy matrix, priority investment programs in\nselected ecoregions, and commitments among partners; (ii) the supporting GEF project brief;\nand  (iii)  prefeasibility  level  assessments  of  suitable  high-priority  investments  for  combined\nADB/GEF/aid agency support.\nB.  Scope\n10. The  PRC/GEF  Partnership  will  act  as  a  mechanism  to  supervise  on  the  WDS  the\nprovisions of the CCD as outlined in the CCD-NAP and related plans, the CBD as outlined in the\nBiodiversity  Conservation  Action  Plan,  and  PRC\u2019s  commitment  to  the  United  Nations\nFramework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCC).12  The  TA  will  be  conducted  in  two\nphases. Phase 1 includes (i) preparing an overview of issues to be considered in formulating a\nCPF, and recommendations for harmonizing laws and policies; (ii) assessing the mandates,\nroles, responsibilities, and programs of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), Ministry of Finance\n                                                \n11 The GEF PDF-B grant of $350,000 was approved by the GEF secretariat on 28 March 2001.\n12 The PRC ratified the UNFCCC on 5 January 1993, the Convention on Biological Diversity on 5 January\n1993, and the CCD on 18 February 1997. In addition, the PRC ratified the Ramsar Convention in 1992.", "4\n(MOF),  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MWR),  State  Environment  Protection  Administration\n(SEPA),  SFA,  and  State  Development  Planning  Commission  (SDPC),  among  others,  then\nformulating recommendations for institutional strengthening and capacity building, eliminating\nconflicting  and/or  overlapping  responsibilities,  introducing  bottom-up  consultative  and\nparticipatory processes involving civil society, and integrating sectoral agencies in formulating\nand implementing projects for integrated ecosystem management; (iii) compiling biodiversity\ninformation for western PRC; (iv) assessing the carbon sequestration potential of western PRC;\n(v) identifying suitable dryland ecoregions as suitable sites for project interventions under the\nPRC-GEF Partnership; (vi) identifying and screening priority packages of investments and TA\nas a sequenced program of interventions to be supported by the PRC-GEF Partnership; (vii)\ncompiling  a  profile  of  the  social  issues  to  be  considered  in  the  CPF,  and  formulating\nrecommendations  for  incorporating  public  participation  processes  and  social  improvement\nstrategies;  (viii)  describing  biophysical  and  socioeconomic  indicators  needed  to  monitor\nchanges  in  the  ecological  environment,  biodiversity  status,  extent  and  severity  of  land\ndegradation, condition of water resources, and social well-being; (ix) preparing a design for a\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  to  monitor  achievement  of  program  objectives;  (x)\nconsultations, workshops, awareness creation, consensus building, and participatory project\ndevelopment; and (xi) preparing a CPF and project brief.\n11. In phase 2, prefeasibility-level analysis will be undertaken for high-priority investment\nprojects, for which possible ADB/GEF/aid agency financing is envisaged, to assess financial\nviability,  socioeconomic  benefits,  environmental  impacts,  potential  for  cost  recovery,  and\npoverty reduction benefits. This phase will also assist future executing agencies to prepare\npreliminary project proposals for external financing to be considered by SDPC and MOF. A\nstudy  tour  of  community-based  land  degradation  control  programs,  such  as  LandCare  in\nAustralia, will help to broaden the programmed approach.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The TA is estimated to cost $1,440,000 equivalent, comprising $695,000 in foreign\nexchange cost and $745,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will finance $800,000\nequivalent  to  cover  $475,000  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $695,000  plus  $325,000\nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the ADB-\nfunded TA Program. Under ADB\u2019s direct administration, GEF has approved a PDF-B grant of\n$350,000 equivalent to cover $220,000 of the foreign exchange cost and $130,000 equivalent of\nthe local currency cost. The Government will finance the remaining local currency cost of\n$290,000 equivalent. Government financing will cover remuneration and per diem of counterpart\nstaff, office accommodation and supplies, local inland travel costs, local communications and\nreports, and surveys, investigations and plans to be carried out by local design institutes during\nthe course of the study. The cost estimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 2. The\nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any\nensuing project.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n13. The Government has recognized the need for an integrated ecosystem management\napproach to land degradation in western PRC. This approach will require overcoming the\nfollowing institutional barriers: (i) lack of policy-relevant data to guide integrated and cross-\nsectoral planning for ecosystem management; (ii) absence of capacity to develop incentives for\nadopting sustainable management practices; (iii) lack of regional planning policies that align\nspatial patterns of human settlements and development activities with requisites of ecosystem", "5\nmanagement, and reduce pressure on ecologically fragile or vulnerable areas; and (iv) limited\ninstitutional capacity to formulate and implement integrated approaches, and constraints to\ninvolving existing technical capacity in the planning process.\n14. In  view  of  these  institutional  barriers,  a  national  steering  committee  was  set  up\ncomprising SFA, MOF, SEPA, MWR, Leading Group on Poverty, SDPC, and MOA, chaired by\nMOF and co-chaired by SFA.13 The Executing Agency will be MOF (specifically under the\noversight  of  the  GEF  Focal  Point),  while  day-to-day  administration  will  be  delegated  to  a\nProgram Management Office (PMO), located within SFA, but staffed by seconded personnel\nfrom several line agencies. Counterpart staff in the PMO will be expected to perform as part of\nthe  overall  TA  team.  SFA  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  implementation  of  PRC\u2019s\ncommitments to the United Nations CCD and, through its provincial offices, manages about 800\nof  PRC\u2019s  nature  reserves  (the  key  repositories  of  the  nation\u2019s  biodiversity).  The  TA  will\nstrengthen SFA\u2019s capacity to implement integrated ecosystem management.\n15. The  TA  will  require  65  person-months  of  consulting  services:  50  domestic  and  15\ninternational.  The  consultants,  to  be  engaged  through  a  firm,  will  be  selected  by  ADB  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for recruiting domestic consultants.14  In  view  of  the  need  to  maintain\ncontinuity between completion of the SSTA and to meet the May 2002 deadline for submission\nof the CPF, advance action will be adopted to recruit consultants on a noncommittal basis. The\ninternational  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  natural  resource  management,  biodiversity,\ncarbon  sequestration/climate  change,  land  use  planning,  and  economics.  The  domestic\nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  natural  resource  planning,  remote  sensing/geographic\ninformation  systems,  social  sciences,  public  expenditure,  erosion  control,  grassland\nmanagement, wildlife ecology, plant biodiversity, forestry, meteorology/climate change, public\nparticipation, and economic planning and appraisal. The terms of reference are in Appendix 3.\nThe TA will be implemented over 12 months, and is expected to commence in July 2001\n(Appendix  4).  Following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement,  the  consultants  will  procure\nequipment and software, arrange for the study tour, commission research papers, and assume\nconference expenses and other miscellaneous costs.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n16. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB\nadministering a portion of the technical assistance to be financed by the Global Environment\nFacility, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000, and (ii) the\nprovision of technical assistance to be financed by ADB on a grant basis, in an amount not\nexceeding the equivalent of $800,000, both to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina for the purpose of preparing a PRC-GEF Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland\nEcosystems, and hereby reports such action to the Board.\n                                                \n13 Additional agencies (such as the Leading Group on WDS under State Council) may be included in the steering\ncommittee during implementation.\n14 The methodology and terms of reference of the consulting services are specific and clearly identified. Hence,\nADB\u2019s procedure for simplified technical proposals will be used to select the consultants (Project Administration\nInstructions, 3.01, paras. 41-42, 1 July 1996).", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Performance Monitoring Assumptions\nSummary Indicators/Targets Mechanisms and Risks\nGoal\nCombat land Integrated ecosystem Policy statements of Consensus on the\ndegradation and management Leading Group on definition of integrated\nreduce poverty in effectively WDS, central and ecosystem management\nselected ecosystems mainstreamed into provincial government and its role in the WDS\nof national and global the western agencies\nsignificance development strategy Willingness to mainstream\n(WDS) environmental\nconsiderations into\neconomic development\nPurpose\nPrepare a country Endorsement of the Presentation to State Relevant line agencies\nprogramming CPF by Government, Council, minutes of aid and funding agencies will\nframework (CPF) for multilateral and agency coordination be prepared to coordinate\nthe PRC-GEF bilateral agencies, group, and GEF Council their activities under the\nPartnership on Land and civil society decision CPF.\nDegradation, a draft Approval of the CPF\nproject brief for by GEF Council, in GEF will have adequate\nsubmission to GEF, accordance with GEF funding to commit to the\nand conduct pre- Operational Program Partnership for a 10-year\nfeasibility-level 12 on integrated period\nstudies for high ecosystem\npriority investments management\nOutputs\n1.

As  the  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  develop  a  partnership  among  12  provinces,  17\ngovernment agencies, and about 20 international agencies, a series of workshops, seminars,\nand conferences is required. These will comprise (i) regional workshops (3) to seek inputs from\nprovincial (and lower level) authorities and regionally based research agencies; (ii) national\npolicy coordination workshop (Beijing) to ensure that all central level agencies are committed to\na holistic, integrated ecosystems approach, under the auspices of the Western Development\nStrategy; (iii) aid agency coordination group workshops (6), mostly in Beijing, to coordinate aid\nagency programs and commitments; (iv) an international workshop in Beijing to consider the\ndraft Country Programming Framework and to agree on priority projects to proceed to phase 2.\nWhile the number of participants is difficult to state at this stage, we anticipate at least 300 for\nthe regional workshops, 100 for the national workshop, 30-40 for each aid agency coordination\ngroup meeting, and 200 for the international workshop.\n3. The proposed study tour is costed on the basis of a 10-person group to visit LandCare\nactivities in Australia (a community-based program for management of land degradation) for 10\ndays (estimated cost $35,000, including an organization fee, guide, transportation, translation,\naccommodation and per diems, miscellaneous costs). The balance is for four short (1-2 months)\ncourses on selected topics (at appropriate universities overseas) at $10,000 each, as ADB's\ncontribution to capacity building for State Forestry Administration.\n4. Reports include 100 copies of inception report (English only), 100 copies of midterm\nreport (in English, with executive summary in English and Chinese), 100 copies of draft final\nreport (in English, with executive summary in English and Chinese), and 200 copies of final\nreport (in both English and Chinese), plus 100 copies of the main final report in PDF format on\nCD-ROM.", "13\nAppendix 3, page 1\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE\nA. Background\n1.  The objective of the People\u2019s Republic of China-Global Environment Facility (PRC-GEF)\nPartnership is to combat land degradation in dryland ecosystems in the western part of the\nPRC. This will be done through selective support for the National Action Plan for Implementation\nof the Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD-NAP) in synergy with other programs and\nprojects  that  address  land  degradation  in  western  PRC.  The  Partnership  will  (i)  formulate\nstrategies and implement supporting measures to reverse the trend of ecological deterioration\nand promote sustainable natural resources management as an integral part of the western\ndevelopment  strategy  (WDS);  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  conservation  and  sustainable  use  of\nglobally  important  biodiversity  and  promote  carbon  sequestration  in  the  context  of  the\nBiodiversity Conservation Action Plan (BCAP) and the country\u2019s commitment to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n2.  The Partnership will be governed by a country programming framework (CPF) to be\ndeveloped through grant funding provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the\nGlobal Environment Facility (GEF). The CPF will represent an agreement between the PRC and\nthe GEF to commit resources to sequenced priorities over an agreed-upon time frame (10\nyears).1 The CPF will (i) describe the critical policy, legal, and institutional instruments and the\nchanges needed to strengthen the enabling environment; (ii) harmonize relevant sectoral five\nyear development plans and strategies of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), Ministry of Water\nResources (MWR), State Environment Protection Administration (SEPA), and State Forestry\nAdministration (SFA), the CCD-NAP, and the BCAP; (iii) identify ecosystems for priority support\nunder the Partnership; (iv) define prioritized packages of investments and technical assistance\nto advance sustainable development and global environmental outcomes in selected priority\necosystems; and (v) define objectives, milestones, and indicators of favorable outcomes for the\nPartnership to combat land degradation.\n3.  The CPF will specify the overall resource envelope and sequencing of a PRC/GEF\nPartnership Program to be financed by the Government, GEF, and other domestic and external\nsources. External assistance will be tranched, and it is expected that GEF\u2019s contribution will\ndiminish in successive tranches. The first tranche of GEF resources will be approved by the\nGEF Council at the same time as the CPF. Successful delivery of the partnership program will\nbe assessed against programmatic indicators defined in the CPF. Sequential projects of the\nprogram will be approved based on achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks and milestones.\nMonitoring and evaluation (M&E) will be used to improve the likelihood of program success,\nevaluate progress in each phase, and establish targets for subsequent phases. As the program\nproceeds, projects will be elaborated in a flexible way within the agreed-upon programmatic\npriorities specified in the CPF. The program will commence during the 10th Five-Year Plan\n(2001-2005).  Lessons  learned  from  the  initial  years  of  implementation  will  help  shape  the\nsectoral development plans for the 11th Five-Year Plan period and beyond. The PRC practice of\npilot-testing  innovative  policies  and  institutional  approaches  in  designated  areas  before\nwidespread replication will make adaptive learning a major output of the Partnership.\n                                                \n1 Project implementation will continue beyond the 10-year period of financial commitments.\n(Reference in text: page 5, para. 15)", "Appendix 3, page 2\n14\n4.  The partnership program will target specific dryland ecosystems to be defined in the\nCPF  and  to  be  identified  during  implementation  of  the  PDF-B.  These  ecosystems  will  be\nselected  using  these  criteria:  (i)  national  sustainable  development  objectives;  (ii)  global\nenvironment significance; (iii) land degradation status and trends; (iv) potential for poverty\nreduction and economic development; (v) identified priorities in the Biodiversity Action Plan and\nother  relevant  plans;  and  (vi)  opportunity  to  develop  potentially  replicable  responses  for\nintegrated ecosystem management.\n5.  Since the resources available under the partnership program will be small in relation to\nthe overall needs of the CCD-NAP and related plans, the Partnership will focus mainly on\nstrategic investments for demonstration effect that would substantially influence the WDS, serve\nas a mechanism for aid agency coordination in support of the CCD-NAP, provide a window for\nlearning and dissemination of lessons learned from integrated ecosystem management, and\nrecord the achievement of global environmental benefits. To enhance the catalytic nature of the\nPartnership, emphasis will be on the replicability of interventions and the environmental, social,\nand economic sustainability of processes initiated and their outcomes.\nB.
