During the 2002 review of the Country Strategy and Program Update, the Government of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) reconfirmed its request for ADB to provide technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare a project for Sanjiang Plains wetland protection.1 A Fact-Finding \nMission visited the PRC on 9-23 September 2002 and reached an understanding with the \nHeilongjiang Provincial Government (HPG) and the Central Government on the objectives, \nscope, cost estimates, financing plan,  and implementation arrangements of the TA.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  While there has been a marked reduction in poverty in the PRC, significant numbers of \npeople still live below the poverty line. This is particularly true for the remote areas of the \ncountry, including parts of Heilongjiang Province. The PRC needs to continue its focus on \ngenerating inclusive and equitable economic growth and to undertake pro-poor policy measures \nto  help  ensure  that  the  poor  benefit  from  future  economic  development.  Sustainability  of \ndevelopment through appropriate management of natural resources, and consequently, the \nstability of the environment, is part of the war on poverty, since the poor are most vulnerable to \nenvironmental degradation.  \n \n3.  The Sanjiang Plains, in the northeast of Heilongjiang Province, are bordered by two \nrivers\u2013the Heilongjiang in the north and northwest, and the Wusulijiang in the east. These \nconstitute the two major flood plains in the Songhua river basin. These plains, with a population \nof about 8 million, extend over 100,000 square kilometers. The area includes extensive forests \nand plantations covering over 19 million hectares (ha), and the single largest wetland area in the \nPRC, spreading over 2 million ha.  These wetlands are important because of their ability to \nabsorb floods and regulate flows in the rivers, two of which form international borders with the \nRussian Federation. Furthermore, these wetlands act as natural filters for silt and dissolved \npollutants, support major agricultural activities, and are habitat for globally significant flora and \nfauna. \n \n4.  The Sanjiang Plains wetlands, extending over 37 ecosystems, support more than 1,400 \nspecies of flora and more than 1,000 species of fauna, including the globally significant and \nendangered sturgeon.3 To protect this biodiversity, six of the protected areas in the Sanjiang \nPlains have been declared as national nature reserves (NNRs): (i) Xingkaihu (Mishan City), (ii) \nHonghe (Fuyuan County and Tongjiang City), (iii) Black Bee (Raohe County), (iv) Sanjiang \n(Fuyuan County and Tongjiang City), (v) Qixinghe (Baoqing County), and (vi) Naolihe (Baoqing \nCounty and Raohe County).  Three of these\u2013Xingkaihu, Honghe, and Sanjiang\u2013have been \nlisted as the ramsar sites.4  The Black Bee NNR in the Wasulijiang River basin along the Sino-\n                                                 \n1  Wetland protection of the Sanjiang Plains was initially part of project preparatory TA 3376-PRC: The Songhua \nRiver Flood, Wetland, and Biodiversity Management Project, approved on 27 December 1999, and cofinanced by a \nGlobal Environment Facility (GEF)-Project Development Facility (PDF) grant of $330,000. Subsequently, in July \n2001, after an initial analysis of the socioeconomic and biophysical situation in the Sanjiang Plains, a decision was \nmade to process the wetland protection component as an independent proposal, according to the concept entered \ninto the GEF pipeline in 1999. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities  (internet edition) on 2 September 2002. \n3  The biota include 1,470 species of plants (including 291 species of grasses) and 1,046 species of invertebrate \nfauna. The 479 species of vertebrates include 2 species of lampreys, 82 of fish (including the globally significant \nsturgeon), 11 of amphibians, 13 of reptiles, 325 of birds, 78 of mammals, and a diverse population of insects \n(including the internationally recognized northeastern black bee). \n4   Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR Convention). \n ", "2  \nRussian border is significant from an ecological and socioeconomic point of view. Over 140 \nplants in the forests and wetlands in the basin provide an ideal habitat for the bees. The honey \nproduced is considered to be of the best quality in the PRC and has been certified by the \nEuropean Union Organic Food Organization. Beekeeping farmers earn up to Y4,800 annually \n(about $580 equivalent) from 10-12 beehives. However, survival of this species and the ensuing \neconomic  benefits  are  threatened  by  indiscriminate  logging  in  the  area  and  inadequate \nprotection of blackbee host trees.  \n \n5.  Local communities within the Sanjiang Plains rely on biological resources for food, \nenergy, fodder, and raw materials for subsistence and manufacturing. Biological resources such \nas reeds, fish, and waterfowl are commercially exploited and serve as a source of income for \nthese communities. Because of traditional reliance on these biological resources, there is a \nclose relationship between community well-being and access to these resources. \n \n6.  Since the1950s, the Sanjiang Plains have experienced large-scale deforestation and \nconversion into agriculture and state-owned enterprises, mostly for farming. As part of this \nconversion process, an extensive drainage system was constructed beginning in the late 1970s. \nRoads, highways, urbanization, and industrialization have made further inroads into the frontier, \nexacerbating the detrimental impact on the ecological functions and productive potential of the \nnature reserves and wetlands.  \n \n7.  New government policies and plans are aimed at halting and reversing environmental \ndegradation  in  the  area.  Just  completed  master  plans  call  for  delineation  and  effective \nmanagement of core and buffer zones, restriction of economic activities to the experimental \nzones,5 ban on new development activities in the wetlands, and resettlement of people living in \ncore and buffer zones.6 Resettlement will affect the life and well-being of the communities, and \nwill have to be linked to sustainable livelihoods and employment generation.  \n \n8.  Forestland in the Sanjiang Plains covers about 11 million ha, with 1.142 million ha \nmanaged by the Provincial Forestry Department (PFD). Commercial plantations of fast-growing \nspecies cover 50,000 ha of this area, and 17,000 ha are available for new plantations. Because \nmanagement of these plantations is not in line with scientific principles, they have not realized \ntheir potential in terms of growth and quality. Consequently, a potentially self-sustaining sector \nis not delivering a satisfactory output. The sector should be managed on scientific principles to \nincrease production and to ensure sustainable supplies of high-quality raw materials for the \nindustry. Given good soil conditions, there is  potential  for  agroforestry  as  an  income  and \nemployment generation activity, both on farmers\u2019 land and on PFD-managed land.  \n \n9.  A study on sustainable land use in the Sanjiang Plains was undertaken from 1995 to \n1996, with support of the State Development Planning Commission, the Provincial Planning \nCommission, Ecologically Sustainable Development, Inc. (USA), and the National Committee on \nUnited  States-China  Relations  (USA),  which,  among  other  things,  recommended  highly \nselective conversion of remaining wetlands to farmland, and urged investment in productivity \nimprovements in existing farmland.  The study further recommended application to the Ramsar \nConvention Bureau to list parts of the Sanjiang Plains as wetlands of international importance, \n                                                 \n5   The core zone is the inner, core area within the NNR where no extractive activities are permitted. The buffer zone \nis a strip of varying width outside the core zone to protect the core zone from external intrusions and anthropogenic \ninfluences. An experimental zone, outside the buffer zone, is designated for the purpose of demonstrating various \necologically friendly economic development models for income generation and economic growth.  \n6  The initial social assessment has estimated that about 700 households may need resettlement in three NNRs. As \nthe ensuing project may include just two NNRs, the number of households may be reduced by up to at least a half. \n ", "  3\nespecially as a waterfowl habitat, and preserving them as the core of the Sanjiang Plains \nInternational  Peace  Park  and  Wildlife  Refuge.7  In  1999,  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme  (UNDP)/Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  initiated  the  five-year  Wetland \nBiodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Use Project aimed at removing barriers to effective \nbiodiversity conservation at four representative sites of global biodiversity importance, which \ninclude the Sanjiang Wetlands and Honghe NNR in the Sanjiang Plains.  \n \n10.  Over the past several years, considerable efforts have been made in habitat restoration \nand  conservation  of  the  biodiversity  in  the  Sanjiang  Plains  by  the  national  and  local \ngovernments. These include (i) National Wetland Conservation Action Plan and establishment \nof a National Wetland Coordinating Committee involving 17 ministries and other government \nagencies, setting out the Government\u2019s commitment to (a) sustainable use and improved \nprotection of important wetland sites, (b) increase in the number of Ramsar sites, and (c) reform \nof policies related to wetland protection, (ii) Regulations for the Nature Reserves of Heilongjiang \nProvince;  (iii)  establishment  of  the  Northeast  Black  Bee  National  Natural  Reserve;  (iv) \ndesignation of the National Ecological Demonstration Zone for Northeastern Black Bee; and (v) \na program for restoration of the sturgeon habitat and its artificial fertilization, hatching, and \nculture.8  \n \n11.  Master plans have been prepared for the NNRs  in Heilongjiang Province. While the \nadministration and management of the NNRs is under the jurisdiction of PFD, some are still \nunder the control of the Environmental Protection Bureau and state-owned farm enterprises, an \nanomaly that needs to be analyzed and addressed. Each nature reserve has been zoned into \ncore zone, buffer zone, and experimental zone. This zoning system is in line with international \nnorms  and  provides  the  necessary  planning  framework  for  integrating  conservation  and \ndevelopment  activities.  This  approach  makes  protection  and  conservation  of  species  and \nbiodiversity the dominant management objective within the core zone and the buffer zone, \nwhereas economic development is the principal land use and management objective in the \nexperimental zone. The NNR master plans require resettlement of people living within the core \nand buffer zones to experimental zones, where opportunities will be provided for sustainable \nand ecologically sound economic development. \n  \n12.  Continuation  of  these  initiatives  and  effective  implementation  of  these  plans,  while \ncritical for conservation, is constrained by (i) capacity limitations for natural resources and \nbiodiversity assessments, management, and monitoring; (ii)  non-availability of financing on \nsuitable terms attractive for low financial and high economic return conservation and other \nenvironmental services\u2019 activities; (iii) limited borrowing capacity of the counties, townships, \nvillages,  and  farmers;  (iv)  inadequate  awareness  about  the  significance  and  benefits  of \nconservation-based  development  strategies;  and  (v)  limited  funding  for  research  on  the \nrestoration of the habitat for the endangered sturgeon and the black bee. Protecting globally \nsignificant biodiversity in these plains and addressing the problems of poverty while reducing \nand reversing environmental degradation require a comprehensive and integrated strategy. The \nTA will attempt to do so by identifying appropriate approaches and options for conservation and \ndevelopment of the area, which, while maintaining the integrity of the wetland ecosystem, will \nalso enhance and diversify livelihood opportunities for the local communities. \n                                                 \n7  Ecologically Sustainable Development, Inc. 1996.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The purpose of the TA is to prepare an investment project for integrated wetland and \nforest conservation and development in the Sanjiang Plains based on their potential to support \necologically sustainable economic development; promote conservation and sustainable use of \nbiodiversity; and enhance the well-being of local communities, especially the poor.   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will (i) review, and update the mid-term report of the Songhua River Flood, \nWetland,  and  Biodiversity  Management  Project9; (ii) undertake a social assessment in the \nproposed Project area to measure patterns of settlement, resource use and social organization, \ntogether with socioeconomic indicators of well-being, and poverty cause analysis to identify \npotential economic activities and required inputs to benefit the poor; (iii) undertake a sector \nanalysis to identify constraints, and opportunities in the sustainable and integrated conservation \nof biodiversity and economic development of wetlands and forests; (iv) identify priority sites of \nglobal biodiversity significance and threats to these sites, and propose activities to conserve \nbiodiversity; (v) identify investment options for habitat restoration, commercial forestry, and \nalternative livelihoods that do not compromise biodiversity conservation; (vi) assess and identify \nbiophysical and socioeconomic indicators to monitor changes in the biodiversity and integrity of \nnature reserves, and social well-being of the local communities; (vii) analyze the existing legal, \ninstitutional,  and  policy  environment,  and  formulate  recommendations  for  policy  reform; \ninstitutional capacity building for integrated conservation and development; and information \nmanagement and monitoring; (viii) based on past experience and lessons learned in the PRC, \nespecially the UNDP/GEF National Wetlands Project,  and in other countries in the region, \nprepare  a  Feasibility  Study  report  for  an  investment  plan  for  integrated  conservation  and \ndevelopment in the Sanjiang Plains; and (ix) prepare a GEF project brief and appendixes on \nincremental cost analysis, biodiversity threats analysis, and stakeholder involvement plan. The \nteam will also review existing institutions policies and legislation in the implementation of various \ninternational conventions including the Biodiversity Convention and the Ramsar Convention.  \n \n15.  The feasibility study will include economic and financial viability, potential environmental \nimpacts, mitigation and monitoring of potentially adverse impacts, and the potential impact of \nsuch investments on social well-being and income levels of local communities, and the impact \non economic development of the area and the province. See Appendix 1 for Preliminary Project \nFramework.  \nC.  Cost  and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, comprising $400,000 in \nforeign exchange and $350,000 equivalent in local currency costs.  ADB will finance $600,000 \nequivalent to cover all of the foreign exchange cost plus $200,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund funded by \nthe Government of Japan. The Government will contribute the remaining local currency cost of \n$150,000 equivalent. This will include costs of office accommodation and facilities, remuneration \nand per diem of counterpart staff and technical experts, local transportation, and logistical \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1999.

See Appendix 2 of detailed Cost Estimate. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Executing Agency will be HPG, which will coordinate, guide, and supervise all \nactivities pertaining to implementation. To carry out these responsibilities, HPG has a provincial \nleading group (LG) chaired by the executive vice governor in charge of HPG foreign capital \nutilization operations. LG members include heads of the Heilongjiang Development Planning \nCommission (HDPC), the Heilongjiang Financial Department (HFD), the Heilongjiang Auditing \nOffice, and other concerned agencies. The LG will be the policy making body and will be \nresponsible  for  providing  guidance  to  coordinate  the  roles  of  provincial  agencies  and  the \nmunicipal and county governments. For implementation, the vice commissioner of HDPC will be \nthe director of the project management office (PMO) under the leadership of the provincial LG. \nDeputy directors of the PMO will come from HDPC and HFD. Members of the PMO will include \nrepresentatives  of  HDPC,  HFD,  the  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  (EPB),  PFD,  the \nAgricultural Commission, and the Livestock Bureau.   \n \n18.    The TA will require 53 person-months of consulting services: 16 person-months of \ninternational and 37 person-months of domestic consultants (see Appendix 2 for the specific \nexpertise to be provided in each group). Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the  selection  and \nengagement of domestic consultants. Given the highly technical nature of the TA, quality-based \nselection on the basis of full technical proposals to be submitted by consulting firms will be \nadopted. Procurement will follow the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The TA is expected to \ncommence in March 2003 and completed in August 2003. Outline terms of reference are \nattached as Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  The consultants will produce three reports, which will be discussed at tripartite meetings. \nThese include (i) an inception report, which will include a logical framework and a work program, \n(ii) a midterm report, with an updated logical framework and work program providing detailed \ninformation and analysis of various options for investment; (iii) a draft final report, which will \ninclude the objectives; scope; social, environmental, and economic analyses; implementation \narrangements; cost estimates and financing plan; and other relevant details of the investment \nproject; and (iv) a final report of the feasibility study, incorporating the comments on the draft \nfinal report.  \nIV.
