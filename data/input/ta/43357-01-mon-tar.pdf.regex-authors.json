INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In June 2009, the Government of Mongolia requested technical assistance (TA) from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to design a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) model for the \nimplementation of a new combined heat and power (CHP) plant. This plant will help address the \ngrowing  energy  demand  and  provide  sustainable  energy  supply  to  Mongolia\u2019s  capital, \nUlaanbaatar, where the government also plans to retire existing inefficient CHP plants to reduce \nair pollution. This TA is included in ADB's country operations business plan, 2009\u20132012,1 which \nwas approved in October 2009. The TA concept paper was approved on 24 August 2009, and a \nfact-finding mission was fielded from 6 to 9 July 2009.2 The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Mongolia has an extremely harsh winter climate, with temperatures of about \u201310\u00b0to \u201330\u00b0 \nCelsius (C) during the day, dropping to as low as \u201340\u00b0 C at night. In fact, Ulaanbaatar, where \nalmost half of the population lives, is the coldest capital in the world, and its heating season has \nan unusually long duration of 8 months. Every year, the electricity and heating demand have \nincreased  by  5%  and  6%,  respectively,  due  to  the  influx  of  people  from  rural  areas  to \nUlaanbaatar who look for income-generating opportunities.3 In 2008, the incidence of poverty in \nUlaanbaatar was 21.9%, compared to national average of 35.2%. Most of its poor residents \n(204,000 people or 46,000 households) live in an area known as Ger District.  \n \n3.  From 2004 to 2007, the number of business entities in Ulaanbaatar has nearly doubled. \nSeventy  percent  of  the  total  registered  businesses  in  Mongolia  are  in  Ulaanbaatar,  which \naccounts  for  50%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product.4 Presently,  their  heating  and \nelectricity needs are met by three existing coal-based CHP plants, which are old and inefficient. \nThe equipment in CHP plant 2 has been operating for over 40 years, in CHP plant 3 for 30\u201341 \nyears, and in CHP plant 4 for 18\u201326 years. While assistance from various donors has allowed \nthese  plants  to  operate  fairly  reliably,  it  is  generally  agreed  that  most  parts  of  the  heat \nproduction system are nearing the end of their life. Moreover, although retrofits carried out over \nthe past 15 years included some pollution control equipment, the CHP plants still cause severe \nair pollution in Ulaanbaatar during the winter months when they are operating at their highest \ncapacity. According to a recent study on emissions, CHP plants 2 and 3 are major contributors \nof particulate matter in Ulaanbaatar.5  \n \n4.  Considering the growing electricity and heating demand as well as the aging CHP \nplants,6 the supply-side situation is alarming. The current peak demand of electricity in the \ncentral grid system is 675 megawatts-electric (MWe), and heating demand in Ulaanbaatar is \n1,425 megawatts-thermal (MWth). The available generation capacity is 615 MWe and 1,524 \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2009-2012. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 4 August 2009. \n3  The population growth in Ulaanbaatar between 2004 and 2007 was 111%. National Statistics Office of Mongolia. \n2009. Mongolian Statistical Year Book 2008. Ulaanbaatar. \n4  The total businesses registered in Mongolia are 55,901, of which 38,342 were in Ulaanbaatar in 2007 compared to \n20,963 in 2004. In 2007, the total contribution from Ulaanbaatar businesses was MNT2,270 billion in 2007 to the \nnational gross domestic product, which was MNT4,558 billion.  \n5  Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2009. Detailed Planning Survey on the Capacity Development Project for \nAir Pollution Control in Ulaanbaatar City. Tokyo. \n6  Available capacity is 17.6 MWe and 43 MWth for CHP plant 2, and 105 MWe and 562 MWth for CHP plant 3. The \nexpected retirement periods of CHP plants 2 and 3 were 2005 and 2011, respectively, according to Mongolia\u2019s \nenergy sector master plan. CHP plants 2 and 3 will be abandoned after their retirement.   \n ", "2   \nMWth, respectively. If the operations of CHP plants 2 and 3 are interrupted\u2014likely scenario for \n30-year-old equipment\u2014the available capacity will be reduced to 492 MWe and 919 MWth, \nwhich will result in serious shortages. Thus, there is an urgent need to implement a new CHP \nplant to address the vulnerability of power and heating supply in Ulaanbaatar. A reliable heating \nsupply is critical both for the population, as well as to sustain economic activities and welfare. \n \n5.  The government included the new CHP plant 5 among its top priorities in its action plan \nfor 2008\u20132012.7 Its proposed capacity is 300 MWe and 813 MWth (700 gigacalories) with 45% \nof targeted thermal efficiency,8  which will enable it to (i) meet growing energy demand resulting \nfrom rapid urbanization and economic development led by the mining and housing construction \nsectors, (ii) reduce urban air pollution by retiring CHP plants 2 and 3, and (iii) improve the \nsecurity of energy supply to the capital city.  \n \n6.  In  Ulaanbaatar,  the  use  of  CHP  technology  is  highly  advantageous,  because  the \ncombined electricity and heating demand is for over 5 months per year. During this period, \nmuch of the heat that is vented into the atmosphere can be recovered to heat water to about \n160\u00b0 C and circulate it to keep homes and other buildings warm.9 According to the International \nEnergy Agency, CHP technology results in up to 27% lower coal consumption than conventional \nelectricity generation power plant without cogeneration of heat; lower emission of particulate \nmatter that causes air pollution; and lower carbon dioxide emissions, which are responsible for \nglobal climate change.10 \n \n7.  In  Mongolia,  private  investment  in  infrastructure  and  municipal  service  delivery  is \nexpected to play a catalytic role in improving efficiency and quality of public service as well as \nrationalize state expenditure. The government initially wanted the private sector to design, \nfinance, construct, and operate CHP plant 5. It invited bids through international competition \nfrom potential project developers in early 2008; the bidders were also required to propose a \nfinancing package for the project. About 20 potential investors purchased the bid document, but \nonly one bid was submitted, which was evaluated as incomplete.11 The bidder subsequently \nwithdrew. Although the process indicated strong international interest in the project, its failure \ndemonstrated a weak private sector investment environment in Mongolia. Another lesson is that \nthe private sector seems unwilling to take on all risks like a merchant plant. Thus, a public\u2013\nprivate partnership (PPP) approach is preferable, as the government will also share part of the \nperceived risks, thereby improving the overall risk profile for private investment.  \n \n8.  But the existing PPP environment is also challenging due to the absence of an effective \npolicy, legal and regulatory framework, which is essential to attract private investment. An ADB\u2013\nfinanced  TA  study  is  currently  underway  to  assist  the  Government  formulate  an  enabling \nenvironment for PPP through setting up a legal and institutional framework.12 This TA has \nprovided assistance in (i) drafting a Concession Law, which was passed by Parliament in \nJanuary 2010 and will become effective on 1 March 2010; and (ii) designing an institutional \n                                                 \n7  Resolution No. 35 (2008) of the State Great Khural.  \n8  The thermal efficiencies of CHP plants 2 and 3 are 21.4% and 37.2%, respectively, as of 2008. \n9  Over 60% of the heat energy obtained from burning coal is not used for producing electricity and has to be vented \ninto the atmosphere in the cooling towers of a coal-based power plant. \n10 International Energy Agency. 2006.

Manila (TA 7291-MON, \n$200,000, approved on 3 June).  \n ", "  3\ndevelopment framework for a PPP unit13 to support government efforts to engage in more PPP \nprojects. The proposed CHP 5 is expected to be among the first opportunities under this \nimproved PPP framework. But apart from the policy and legal barriers at national level, there are \nstill many critical sector and project related issues which may impact on the CHP 5 attracting \nprivate investment. The sector issues mainly arise due to weak sector governance, inefficient \noperation, subsidy driven non-transparent tariff setting principles, chronically weak financial \nperformance of sector entities and offtaker's credit worthiness. Due to the limited large-scale \ncapital works being undertaken in the sector, the technical and management capacity of staff to \nconduct bidding for a major infrastructure project is generally weak. The bidding document \nprepared for seeking private investment (para. 7) had critical deficiencies that led to its failure.14  \n \n9.  In parallel to improving the bidding documents, assessment of project specific risks for \nprivate investors is needed in close cooperation with the PPP unit. Appropriate risk allocation \nbetween  public  and  private  sectors  and  suitable  risk  mitigation  approaches  are  critical  to \nencourage  private  investors  to  participate  in  infrastructure  and  municipal  service  delivery \nconcessions. The PPP approach for the proposed CHP plant 5 will provide valuable insights \nand lessons in terms of the need for further reform of the enabling environment for PPPs, with a \nview to attracting future PPP transactions. \n \n10.  The proposed CHP plant 5 is in line with (i) Mongolia\u2019s energy sector master plan for \n2002;15 (ii) state policy on fuel and energy from 2008;16 and (iii) the government\u2019s action plan, \n2008\u20132012 (footnote 7). It is also in line with ADB's sector priorities and Strategy 202017 to \naddress environmental sustainability of a key infrastructure project. Furthermore, ADB's country \nstrategy and program, 2006\u2013200818 identifies inclusive social development and stable broad-\nbased economic growth as two strategic pillars, and the absence of reliable electricity and \nheating services in the capital city could be major constraints to achieving these pillars.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n11.  The TA aims to address growing energy demand, provide a sustainable energy supply in \nUlaanbaatar through the use of CHP technology and PPP, and retire inefficient power plants to \nreduce air pollution in the city. The TA will assist the government in (i) preparing a technical \nstudy  on  the  proposed  CHP  plant  5  that  includes  technical  specifications,  plant  boundary \nconditions, financial and economic analyses, and social and environmental safeguard issues; \n                                                 \n13 The PPP unit is to manage PPP transactions and be a resource for PPP related knowledge and procedures. \nAdopting  best  practices,  the  unit  will  provide  guidance  and  assistance  on:  (i)  organizing  tenders,  (ii) \nevaluating contracts, (iii) concession agreements, or contract clauses, and (iv) detailed procedures for identifying, \nevaluating, and procuring PPPs. The unit will interface with transaction advisers, line ministers and the private \nparty. The unit will be part of the State Property Committee. The unit was assigned this role in the State Policy on \nPPP, adopted last year and their role is codified in the Concession Law. \n14 The critical deficiencies in the bid documents were (i) explanation of the bid evaluation criteria; (ii) poorly drafted \ntechnical specifications and incomplete drawings for the heating transmission network and railway lines for coal \nsupply; (iii) unsatisfactory demand projects and economic justification; (iv) absence of a heating development plan \nthat accounted for the retirement of existing CHP plants; (v) clarity regarding the structure of the investment; (vi) \nsources of water and start-up power supply; (vii) land availability; (viii) approval status of the environmental impact \nassessment; and (ix) tariffs for electricity, water, and coal. \n15 ADB. 1999.
