THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $177,500,000 to PT Supreme Energy Rantau Dedap (SERD) for the Rantau Dedap \nGeothermal Power Project (Phase 2) in the Republic of Indonesia. The report also describes the \nproposed administration of a loan of $50,000,000 to be provided by the Clean Technology Fund \n(CTF), which will be a rollover from an existing CTF facility supporting phase 1 of the project),1 \nfor the Rantau Dedap Geothermal Power Project (Phase 2);2 and if the Board approves the \nproposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the CTF loan. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  Indonesia, the largest economy in Southeast Asia, had an estimated gross domestic \nproduct of $932.3 billion (current United States dollars) in 2016.3 It experienced consistent growth \nafter the Asian financial crisis, averaging 5.0% per year during 2011\u20132016, down from 6.4% in \n2010. Improved access to affordable and sustainable forms of energy is critical to enhance the \ncompetitiveness of Indonesia\u2019s power infrastructure, which has been struggling to keep up with \nthe country\u2019s strong economic performance. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources \n(MEMR) anticipates power demand to increase under current forecasts, resulting in a shortage \nthat could undermine the country\u2019s sustainable growth potential if not addressed adequately. \n \n3.  Indonesia  has  an  estimated  potential  of  29.5 gigawatts  (GW)  of geothermal  energy \nresources (the largest in the world), 75.0 GW of hydropower, 532.6 GW of solar power, 32.6 GW \nof biomass and biogas, and 113.5 GW of wind power.4 Nearly every renewable subsector remains \nundeveloped, and the total installed geothermal power capacity in 2017 was only 1.8 GW.5 \n \n4.  To  cope  with  predicted  future  electricity  shortages,  the  Government  of  Indonesia \nintroduced fast-track programs to accelerate power generation development. In its national \ndevelopment plans for 2015\u20132024, it introduced a third fast-track program targeting the addition \nof 35 GW of power by 2019. In early 2017, pursuant to the National Electricity Business Plan, \n2017\u20132026, it adjusted the target completion dates and capacities under this program to 29 GW \nby the end of 2019 and 35 GW by the end of 2021.6 While the largest share of generated energy \nis still expected to come from fossil fuels, the government is encouraging greater use of renewable \nenergy sources in the generation mix. It has set ambitious targets to increase the share of \nrenewable energy from 12% in 2013 to 23% in 2025 in the primary energy mix.7 \n                                                           \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2014.

Manila. \n ", "2 \n5.  Simultaneously, the government aims to reduce electricity generation costs. MEMR issued \nnew regulations in January 2017 to set renewable energy tariffs against local and national grid \nprices, to regulate the procurement process, and more generally to reallocate some risks under \npower purchase agreements (PPAs).8 \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n6.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) and CTF support for phase 1 of the project (footnote 1) \nvia a $50 million exploration loan financed entirely by CTF in 2014 supported initial drilling and \nexploration  which  successfully  quantified  and  characterized  the  nature  of  the  geothermal \nresources. This has resulted in Phase 2 which will develop the geothermal steam resources at \nthe site through further drilling and construction of production and injection facilities prior to the \noperation and maintenance of a power plant. \n \n7.  SERD will construct, operate, and maintain the project, with a design gross capacity of \n98.4 megawatts (MW) and net capacity of 90.9 MW, in South Sumatra Province. It is located \nabout 225 kilometers (km) southwest of Palembang across the administrative areas of Muara \nEnim Regency, Lahat Regency, and Pagar Alam City. It is within the 353 square km Rantau \nDedap Geothermal Working Area along the Great Sumatran Fault and the Bukit Barisan mountain \nrange at an altitude of 1,500\u20132,600 meters above sea level. \n \n8.  The project will be connected from its switchyard to the Lahat grid owned by Perusahaan \nListrik  Negara  (PLN),  Indonesia\u2019s  state-owned  power  utility.  PLN  is  responsible  for  the \ntransmission line that will run from the Rantau Dedap Geothermal Plant to the substation.  \n \n3.  Borrower and Sponsors \n \n9.  SERD, a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Indonesia is the borrower. SERD is \nowned by PT Supreme Energy (Supreme), Engie, Marubeni Corporation (Marubeni), and by \nTohoku Electric Power (Tohoku).  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n  \n10.  Based in France, Engie is among the world\u2019s leading independent power producers. Its \ncore operations include power, natural gas and energy services. With operations in 70 countries \nit has 113 GW of installed capacity, of which 21.5 GW is in the renewable energy sector. Marubeni \nis a Japanese trading house with activities in a variety of sectors such as textiles, chemicals, \nenergy, metals, mineral resources, and power. In the power sector, Marubeni has 41 GW of \ncapacity in 23 countries around the world. Marubeni has previous experience operating in \nIndonesia as it is a current shareholder in the Cirebon and Paiton 2 coal power projects. \n \n11.  Recently established in 2007, Supreme is a small developer focusing on geothermal \nenergy projects in Indonesia. Phase 2 will be the company\u2019s second geothermal project under \ndevelopment. The management team have a history of successfully developing and operating \ngeothermal projects in the country with previous organizations. Tohoku is a top-tier Japanese \npower utility with over 7 million customers in Japan. It has installed capacity of 19 GW across \n                                                           \n8  Government of Indonesia, MEMR. 2017.

Integrity due diligence was conducted.9 Enhanced tax integrity due diligence was also \nconducted on the transaction.10 ADB\u2019s review of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe \nthat such entity has been established or is being used for cross-border tax evasion, money \nlaundering, or terrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the project. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n13.  Impacts. Indonesia intends to use sustainable electricity to drive economic activity and to \nenhance quality of life.11 ADB financing will support MEMR\u2019s plan to expand the capacity of \ngeothermal power generation from 1,858.5 MW in 2017 to 7,241.0 MW by 2025, and to raise the \nshare of new and renewable energy in the grid power generation capacity to 33% (45 GW).12 It \nwill also contribute to Indonesia\u2019s target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 29% relative to \na business-as-usual scenario by 2030.13 \n \n14.  Outcome. The outcome will be geothermal power of 702.5 gigawatt-hours generated \nannually to meet the increasing electricity demand and avoid carbon dioxide emissions equivalent \nto 403,000 tons per year. \n \n15.  Outputs. The outputs are (i) 90.9 MW total capacity of geothermal power generation \ninstalled and operated by the private sector, (ii) employment generated for the local community, \n(iii) local and national economy stimulated, and (iv) economic opportunities for women improved. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n16.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project supports private \nsector participation in infrastructure and environment, two of the five core pillars of ADB\u2019s long-\nterm strategy as reaffirmed by the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.14 The project is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Indonesia, 2016\u20132019 in supporting the expansion of \ninfrastructure and environment-friendly technologies for clean energy generation.15 It contributes \nto the objectives of Indonesia\u2019s National Energy Plan (footnote 12) and to the 2015 commitment \nto the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n \n17.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy,16 which states that support for renewable energy projects \nwill be prioritized and broadened. The project fully aligns with ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy for \n                                                           \n9  ADB. 2003.

Further, the project \ncomplements recent ADB assistance programs to MEMR and PLN for policy-based lending and \ndirect investments17 as well as other ADB public sector initiatives to review geothermal tariff \nincentives. ADB is also supporting the government in strengthening and expanding Sumatra\u2019s \ntransmission and distribution network.18 The project builds on ADB\u2019s private sector experience \nand recent geothermal project financing, such as phase 1 of the project and the Sarulla and Muara \nLaboh geothermal power projects.19 \n \n18.  Lessons from previous operations. The project will benefit from ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations Department\u2019s exposure to the Indonesian energy sector and experience gained from \nstructuring and implementing energy projects in Indonesia. ADB has already supported phase 1 \nof the project and is familiar with the project\u2019s history. The Private Sector Operations Department\u2019s \nexperience indicates that successful project implementation depends on the sponsors\u2019 strength, \nexperience, and ability to understand the regulatory environment, as well as the terms and \nconditions governing the financing of such projects. ADB is confident that the sponsors can \nsuccessfully implement the project, given their track record. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE.

PLN\u2019s obligations under the PPA are \nsupported by the Government of Indonesia (rated BBB\u2013 by Standard & Poor\u2019s and Baa3 by \nMoody\u2019s) through a business viability guarantee letter.  \n \nOperation and maintenance works will be carried out by the borrower.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nPerformance  The borrower will submit (i) unaudited and annual audited financial statements, (ii) environmental \nmonitoring  and social monitoring reports, and (iii) development effectiveness reports to the Asian \nDevelopment Bank. \nCOD = commercial operation date, MW = megawatt, PLN = Perusahaan Listrik Negara (national power utility), \nPPA = power purchase agreement, PT PRA = PT Plumpang Raya Anugrah. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \nADB assistance will have two components: (i) a direct loan of up to $177.5 million; and (ii) a CTF \nloan of $50.0 million, to be administered by ADB. The CTF loan is a rollover from the existing loan \nprovided for phase 1.21  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n20.  Blended concessional financing. The Sarulla, Muara Laboh well as phase 1 and 2 of \nRantau Dedap will result in four ADB-CTF transactions in the geothermal sector in Indonesia \nfunded ADB\u2013CTF Private Sector Geothermal Energy Program. CTF is funded by the multilateral \nClimate Investment Funds and promotes financing for demonstrating, deploying, and transferring \nlow-carbon  technologies  with  strong  potential  for  long-term  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas \nemissions. It is one of the largest multilateral funds that help finance climate change mitigation \nprojects in developing countries.22 A minimum concessional approach was taken with regards to \nprice and structure for the CTF tranche, and the project is consistent with the principles agreed \nby development finance institutions on the use of blended concessional finance.23 \n21.   \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n22.  Indonesia\u2019s  substantial  geothermal  resource  is  not  yet  transformed  into  increasing \ngeothermal power plants capacities. The use of blended concessional finance to support early \nmovers in private sector development of geothermal energy in Indonesia will help accelerate \n                                                           \n21 The $50 million CTF loan provided for phase 1 has already been counted as ADB climate funding. ADB climate \nfunding for phase 2 consists only of the $177.5 million ADB loan. \n \n \n ", "6 \nprogress toward commercial sustainability. ADB\u2019s engagement helps make this project viable and \nwill inspire trust in interested investors from the private sector. \n \n23.  The project\u2019s sustainability depends on its ability to amortize its very high up-front capital \ncosts over a long period to reduce annual debt service. The long tenor of the ADB loan is \nnecessary for the project to achieve sound debt service levels over the life of the project. \n \n24.  The project supports the government\u2019s objective to accelerate and expand private sector \ninvestment in clean energy infrastructure in Indonesia. ADB plays a pivotal role in building a critical \nmass of renewable energy projects in Indonesia to stimulate investor interest in future renewable \nenergy investments and build on the experience of these first-generation investments. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n25.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS),  the  project  is \nclassified category A for the environment, category B for involuntary resettlement, and category \nC for indigenous peoples. \n \n26.  SERD has completed the construction of the access roads, well pads, and other facilities; \nand the exploration drilling program. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project \nhave been identified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \nadverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. The institutional capacity \nand commitment of SERD to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed \nadequate. SERD has undertaken meaningful consultation with the relevant stakeholders and has \nestablished a grievance redress mechanism. A transmission line and a proposed new substation \nto be constructed by PLN are considered associated facilities. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n27.  The  transmission  line  passes mostly  through modified  habitat,  with  a  small  section \ncrossing  natural  habitat.  Although  the  sponsors  are  not  responsible  for  the  impact  of  the \ntransmission line, they have included measures to offset the impact on the natural habitat in their \nbiodiversity offset strategy. The sponsors are coordinating closely with PLN, and ADB will work \nwith the sponsors to ensure that SPS requirements for associated facilities are met. SERD carried \nout an audit of the existing facilities and committed to a corrective action plan following the SPS. \nThe audit found that the project complies with ambient environmental standards. The project is \nlocated  in  a  nationally  designated  protection  forest  and  is  consistent  with  the  legal  and \n ", "7 \nmanagement requirements for this type of forest.24 The designation is not equivalent to protected \narea Category I or II of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but the project affects \nthe  natural  habitat  of  endangered  and  endemic  species.25 A  critical  habitat  assessment \nundertaken by qualified biodiversity experts has resulted in the development of a biodiversity \naction plan (BAP), which includes both long-term biodiversity conservation actions and on-site \nmitigation measures linked to the construction and operation activities of the project. The BAP will \nbe supported with a biodiversity offset strategy and a biodiversity offset management plan. The \nbiodiversity offset strategy includes ongoing contingency for management beyond the offset \nmanagement period. The sponsors have committed to these plans to ensure that the project will \nnot have an adverse impact on critical habitat such that (i) there are no measurable adverse \nimpacts on the critical habitat that could impair its ability to function, and (ii) there is no reduction \nin the population of any recognized endangered or critically endangered species. ADB will closely \nmonitor the construction and operational activities, focusing on BAP implementation. \n \n28.  SERD acquired land for the project through negotiated settlements with project-affected \nhouseholds.
