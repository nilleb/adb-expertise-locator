INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Pakistan (the Government) has requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to finance the proposed hill torrents management project (the Project) from the \nsavings of the ongoing loan for the Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project, Stage III (CRBIP-\nIII).1 The need of the Project for the hill torrents that cross the Chashma Right Bank Canal \n(CRBC)2 was earlier raised in the stakeholder workshop for CRBIP-III that was held in March \n2002, and discussed between ADB and the Irrigation and Power Department (IPD) of the \nGovernment of Punjab (the Punjab). IPD carried out an updated feasibility study for the Project \nin 2004-05. ADB reviewed the proposed plan and design, and recommended that the design of \nstructures be reviewed to reduce the technical risks involved with them. ADB proposed to \nprovide  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  to  finance  necessary  revision  works.  ADB \nManagement cleared a concept paper for the TA in September 2005. A TA fact-finding mission \nwas fielded from 10 to 18 October 2005, and reached an agreement with the Government on \nthe  goals,  impacts,  outcomes,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference of the TA.3 The TA design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The alluvial fan (pachad) area located to the west of CRBC has been left undeveloped, \nmaking agriculture dependent on highly unpredictable and often uncontrollable hill torrent floods. \nWhen hill torrent floods are large in scale, people in pachad and the riverine area of the Indus \nRiver both suffer from severe flood damage. Under the spate irrigation system, communities in \npachad area construct earthen bunds in hill torrents every year to divert floodwater into their \nland, and then breach them after sufficient volume of water is dawn. However, intense floods \n                                                 \n1  Loan No. 1146-PAK (SF), approved on 17 December 1991 for 213.34 million, and to be closed on 30 June 2009. \nAs of 25 October 2005, the uncommitted loan amount is $38.16 million. \n2  CRBC is the canal system that was developed under the three stages of CRBIP. CRBC consists of 274 kilometer \nlong main canal and 71 distributary canals with a total length of 863 kilometers. The system is to irrigate the total \ncultivable command area of about 252,000 hectares. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 27 September 2005. \n ", "2   \ncannot be diverted, as earthen diversion weirs can easily be breached by floods. The Project \nhas been proposed by the Punjab to construct permanent structures to disperse the torrential \nfloods in pachad area, and thereby making it possible to utilize flood water for spate irrigation in \na controlled manner, and reduce the flood risk in downstream area. Three major hill torrents in \nthe west of the CRBC, Sanghar, Vehowa, and Kaura were proposed to be covered under the \nProject. The proposed Project is independent in nature and it is complementary to CRBIP-III, as \nit would also reduce the risk of floods from the three hill torrents in the area to the immediate \nwest to the main canal, which has been identified as one of the adverse impacts of the CRBIP-\nIII. \n \n3.  The proposed project is expected to save poorer people in the dry zone from flood \ndamage and enhance their agricultural production by increasing usable flood water for farming. \nThis  will  contribute  to  sustainable  pro-poor  growth,  one  of  three  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  Country \nStrategy and Program approved in May 2002. Both the Government and the Punjab are strongly \ncommitted to poverty reduction, providing the poor with increased economic opportunities and \ngreater access to physical and social assets as expressed in their poverty reduction strategies,4 \nas  well  as  in  the  partnership  agreement  with  ADB.5 The  proposed  Project  is,  therefore, \nconsistent with the development strategies of the Government, the Punjab, and ADB. \n \n4.  In March 2005, IPD completed with its own resources a feasibility study6 that updated an \nearlier study carried out in 1995-96.7 ADB and IPD reviewed the final report and noted that while \nthe study in general provides an adequate basis for project approval, there remains technical \nuncertainty in the design of some structures that may lead to vulnerability to potential large \nfloods. In August 2005, ADB\u2019s staff consultant and IPD agreed that additional work was needed \nto review the structural design. In view of the importance of a revision of the design that would \nimprove technical soundness of the proposed Project, ADB proposed to finance the re-design \nwork from its TA modality. \n \n5.  There have been several interventions made to hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan District \nthat are located to the south of the CRBC area. Construction of diversion structures to Kaha hill \ntorrent, being financed under ADB-financed Flood Protection Sector Project and completed in \n1996, was the first major intervention made in the District. This was followed by a project for \nVidore hill torrent, being financed as part of a World Bank loan and completed in 1996, and the \nMithawan Hill Torrent Pilot Project in Punjab, financed by the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency and completed in 1999. As of August 2005, structures constructed in Kaha hill torrent \nhave been severely damaged by a series of floods in recent years, and main parts of five out of \n13 structures have collapsed completely, while the rest are functioning partially. Three cross \nstructures  were  totally  washed  away  by  floods  due  to  lack  of  river  bed  fixing  and \ndebris/sedimentation  management  structures  in  upstream,  and  inadequate  design  of \nstructures.8 On the other hand those in Vidore and Mithawan hill torrents perform relatively \nbetter, though with some sedimentation and minor damages. The better performance is mainly \n                                                 \n4  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper,  December  2003,  http://www.adb.org/Documents/Poverty/pa_pak.pdf,  and \nPunjab Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (P-PRSP), October 2003. \n5  Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement Between the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the \nAsian Development Bank, September 2002, http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr0424.pdf \n6  National Engineering Services Pakistan (pvt) Limited.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  TA  will  help  the  Punjab  complete  the  design  of  the  proposed  hill  torrent \nmanagement project for the three hill torrents located in the CRBC area, namely, Sanghar, \nVehowa, and Kaura hill torrents. The proposed Project intends to (i) reduce flood incidents in \nthe alluvial fun areas and Indus riverine area located in the upper and lower slope of the \ncommand  area  of  the Chashma  Right  Bank  Irrigation  Project,  and  (ii) increase agricultural \nproduction in the alluvial fan area. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will be implemented on the basis of the extensive studies on hill torrents that \nhave been carried out by the Irrigation and Power Department (IPD) in the past. The TA will be \nguided by the following principles: (i) hill torrent structures should be designed based on the \nfield observation of the topographic, geotechnical, and hydrological conditions of the specific \nlocations,  rather  than  a  desk  study,  as  well  as  considering  the  lessons  learned  from  the \nexperiences of existing structures in other hill torrents; (ii) given the unpredictability of the \ntorrential  floods,  design  of  structures  and  their  safety  level  must  be  determined  with  due \nconsideration of  possible errors in hydrological projection, and the best possible alternative \noptions found to cope with erratic floods; and (iii) design of structures should be determined at \nthe point where the marginal cost of enhancing the specification becomes equal to the marginal \nbenefit from it.  \n \n8.  The proposed Project is to construct flood dispersion and diversion structures in three \nhill torrents that cross the Chashma Right Bank Canal in its Stage III section, namely, Sanghar, \nVehowa, and Kaura. Social mobilization and training to strengthen water user groups will also \nbe provided. The proposed Project would consist of (i) flood dispersion and diversion structures, \n(ii) strengthening water user groups, and (iii) detailed design and project management. The \nstructures to be constructed will disperse torrential floods to the branch channels in a controlled \nmanner, and thereby decrease the flood discharge to downstream of the torrents, and increase \nthe volume of usable flood water for spate irrigation in the alluvial fan area. Appendix 2 provides \nan initial poverty and social analysis of the proposed Project. \n \n9.  It is envisaged that the outputs of the TA would form the basis for IPD to prepare a \nproject document that is needed for obtaining government\u2019s approval, and provide necessary \ninformation for obtaining ADB\u2019s approval to finance the proposed Project from the savings of the \nloan for CRBIP-III. The TA will also support IPD in establishing a panel of experts to review and \nsupervise the technical aspects in design and construction works under the proposed Project. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $165,000 equivalent. ADB will finance a total of \n$150,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe Government will provide the remaining local currency cost of $15,000 equivalent. Detailed \n ", "4   \ncost estimates are given in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of \nthe TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months, commencing in January 2006 and ending \nin April 2007. Of the period, main work for the design review will be carried out in the initial three \nmonths,  followed  by  12  months  to  support  the  panel  of  experts  intermittently.  Individual \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  for  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  All  procurement  under  the  TA  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. The TA will require a total of 14 person-months of consulting services, comprising \n3 person-months of international and 11 person-months of domestic consultants\u2019 inputs. The \nTA\u2019s initial three-month work will be led by a domestic river structure engineer with experience \nin working on design and construction supervision of hill torrent intervention structures. Other \ndomestic  consultants\u2019  expertise  is  required  for  the  initial  three-month  work  in  design  and \nhydrology. An international hill torrent specialist will provide guidance to the design work at \ncommencement of the services and review the outputs in the end of the three-month period with \nhis/her 1.5 person-months services. Another 1.5 person-months of the international consultant\u2019s \nservices and 2 person-months of a domestic Senior Engineer will be allocated for them to serve \nas two non-government members of the five-member panel of experts that will be formed to \nprovide advisory services in formulating a hill torrent management strategy, and supervising the \ndetailed  design  and  initial  implementation  of  the  proposed  Project.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference for consulting services are in Appendix 4. \n \n12.  The executing agency for the TA will be IPD. IPD will provide necessary support to the \nTA consultants in performing their terms of reference, including access to information and \nprojects sites and facilities. The Chief Engineer, Dera Ghazi Khan Zone will serve as a TA \nManager, concurrently with his ordinary duties as a head of the zonal office, and responsible for \nassigning counterpart staff who will work together with the consultants to implement the TA. The \nChief Engineer, Dera Ghazi Khan Zone will subsequently serve as a Project Director during \nproject implementation. The Government has agreed to (i) appoint one qualified staff as a full-\ntime TA coordinator, and supporting staff as required; (ii) provide office space within the Dera \nGhazi  Khan  Zone  Office  of  IPD,  utilities,  furnishings,  and  communication  facilities  for  the \nconsultants; (iii) provide assistance to the consultant in collecting data and information needed \nfor carrying out their assignments, and in conducting consultation meetings and workshops; \n(v) obtain permission from the Government for the international consultant to enter Dera Ghazi \nKhan subdistrict, as needed; and (vi) prepare a simple and easy-to-understand brochure of the \nproposed Project in local language, and distribute it to the people in the project area for public \nawareness purposes. Equipment procured under the TA will be turned over to the executing \nagency. \n \n13.  The consultants will deliver (i) a revised design report for the Project including a revised \ncost estimate, and (ii) a revised Project document for Government approval. These reports will \nbe submitted to ADB and IPD in forms of hard copy and soft copy. Following ADB\u2019s Public \nCommunication Policy, all reports that will be delivered under the TA will be disclosed to the \npublic upon finalization. A tripartite meeting between the Government, ADB, and the consultants \nwill be held in Lahore following the submission of the revised design report. \n ", "  5\n14.  An  advanced  payment  facility  amounting  to  $7,000  will  be  established  for  IPD  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  of  Technical  Assistance  for  the \nexpenses of workshops and equipment.  \n \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \n1.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) poverty partnership document for Pakistan recognizes that rural economy is \nbuilt around the sustainable use of natural resources particularly irrigation water and cultivable land.1 Based on an \nanalysis of poverty determinants, the government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper2 places emphasis on the \nemerging correlation that the rural poor are highly vulnerable to droughts, as a significant finding to help frame a \npoverty reduction strategy. Thus one of the goals explicitly elaborated in this strategy is to address water scarcity and \nthe flow of floodwater that remains unutilized. Rapid growth in agriculture is attributed to a strong labor bias and \nassociated self employment opportunity. Access to cultivable land assets is recognized to have a positive impact on \nthe food and nutritional requirements of poor households. Improved natural resource management and irrigation \nincrease productivity in agriculture and livestock, income generation opportunities, and the reliability of livelihood for \nsmall farmers, women and the landless.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nPoverty analysis has been made and summarized as follows: \n \nThe number of poor3 in Pakistan has more than doubled in the nineties as the number of poor increased to 45 million \nin 1999, of which 33 million or 73% (4.7 million households) are estimated to live in rural areas. Moreover, Pakistan \nranks poorly in major social indicators: infant mortality in rural areas is 106 per 1000 live births; malnutrition of children \nunder 5 is 39%. An important feature of poverty in Pakistan is the clustering of incomes around the poverty line, as \n40.5% of the nation\u2019s population falls in a narrow income range around this line. Approximately 12.2% of the total \npopulation may be classed as chronically or extremely poor. According to the Social Policy and Development Center\u2019s \nassessment in the nineties over a ten-year period the disposable income of the top income quintile grew in real terms \nby 23%, while that of the lowest quintile grew by 3%, increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. 4 \nIn Punjab, 36.3 % of the rural population lives below the poverty line. These high levels of poverty in rural areas tie in \nclosely with particularly low growth rates in the agriculture sector over the past decade. Growth in agricultural GDP \nhas been below 5% for most of the 1990s and due to a prolonged and serious drought dropped into negative figures in \n2001 and 2002. The unirrigated areas suffered much more severely as a result of the drought than the canal irrigated \nareas. Poor yields or complete crop failures forced many farmers into debt and to abandon their lands during this \nperiod. \n \nIn a self assessment by communities during a participatory rural assessment in the Project area, the communities in \nthe Sanghar area classified 25% households amongst themselves as living below the poverty line and 15% as poor. In \nVehowa and Kaura, the averages of the self assessments worked out at 30 % below the poverty line, and 30% as \npoor. The very poor were described to include the destitute and the landless with no access to land, no assets and \nnegligible livestock; and those who have no stable source of labor, are sole wage earners in the family, barely manage \n20 days of work in a month, and usually have several small children. They are not in a position to have access to \ncredit services. Both man and wife work during the wheat harvest when labor is paid in kind to increase their family\u2019s \nfood security. Their annual income, when monetized, does not exceed PRs3,500 per month. Poor usually include \nlandless who have access to regular labor opportunity or who sharecrop relatively small holdings. They tend to have \n                                                 \n1  Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement Between the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the \nAsian Development Bank, September 2002, http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr0424.pdf \n2  Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), December 2003, http://www.adb.org/Documents/Poverty/pa_pak.pdf. \n3  The official poverty line is estimated at 2,350 calories/day/adult, equivalent to PRs750 per month in 2002-PRSP.  \nThis was calculated at prices of 2000-01.  Estimated inflationary changes at prices of 2004 raise it to PRs850 per \nadult equivalent per month (Economic Survey of Pakistan 2004). \n4  Social Policy and Development Center, Annual Report 2001. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nfewer children or grown-up boys who also supplement the family income through labor or in tending a small flock of 10 \nto 15 goats. Just a few amongst them will have any milk animals. They can usually afford to purchase grocery on \ncredit and informal loans. They labor on other peoples\u2019 fields every year during the wheat harvest to create or \nsupplement their own stock of grain. The annual income for this category of households would range between \nPRs3,500 and PRs5,000.   \nSharecroppers are either small land owners who take on additional land to make their operations viable or landless \ncultivators, generally households that have been categorized as poor above. The direct impact that Project structures \nwill have on spate irrigation sharecroppers is that it will relieve them of their obligation for the labor and time intensive \ncollective labor that they had to perform for raising diversions in the main torrent several times a year, which translates \nas a direct benefit of project intervention for the poor. This raises a valid concern. With the elimination of the most \nlabor and time intensive activity in spate irrigation agriculture, land owners are likely to dispense with sharecropping \narrangements and evict their tenants increasing the vulnerability of the landless. On closer examination there is not \nmuch likelihood for this to happen. While the intensity of labor for irrigation preparation has reduced due to \nmechanization, specifically due to the tractor, the preparation for irrigation and the irrigation process itself in spate \nirrigation agriculture requires motivated and committed labor driven by an interest in increased productivity and \nconsequently an increased share and not merely the wage at the end of a particular day. Sharecropping as a \npreferred mode of organization of spate irrigation agriculture will continue after the Project. The increase in cultivated \nland due to the Project is also expected to increase the demand for new sharecropping arrangements increasing \nincome opportunities for the landless and small landholding poor.    \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction in the west of the Chashma Right Bank Canal through improved natural \nresource  management,  increased  productivity  in  agriculture  and  livestock,  and  increased  income  generation \nopportunities for small farmers, women, and the landless. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nSpate irrigation system is a community-operated and managed system with a long history. The Project is intervening \nwith concrete and gabion structures that will eliminate the need for construction (raising and re-raising) of the earthen \ndiversion structures several times a year. The community will continue to manage and operate the system but the \nnature of this kamara i.e., participation in collective work, will change from participation in construction to participation \nin maintenance.  \nDuring Planning: Recognizing that spate irrigation has old and established upper riparian rights and sensitive lower \nriparian concerns, and that there is cogent local knowledge that only communities have about spate irrigation which \ncannot be ignored, participation, consultation, and information dissemination have been diligently incorporated during \nplanning. The feasibility study consultants proposed structures in consultation with farmer water users. A special \nstakeholder consultation with the beneficiaries by the Irrigation Department was facilitated to explain the proposed \nintervention. Particularly because of the potentially cataclysmic nature of the hill torrents and of flood irrigation it was a \nmajor concern of both the Government of Punjab and ADB that the beneficiaries of the Project understand clearly \nwhat was being finally proposed. Spate irrigation systems is the farmers\u2019 own system and from experience of the past \nseveral  hundred  years  they  know  best  the  behavior  of  their  respective  hill  torrent  flows,  their  own  irrigation \nrequirements, their established water rights, the methods of diversion and use of varying flows, and the rules of \ndistribution. The farmers were facilitated to focus on the proposed improvement by reiterating the working of the \nsystem and the changes it has undergone over time.  The feedback has been carefully incorporated in subsequent \nrevisions of the plan.  \n \nDuring  Implementation: Social mobilization on the Project will precede detailed design, land acquisition, and \nconstruction. The approach to realize participation during implementation and post project operations will be to \norganize the existing community of interest at each diversion into a committee representing all the subgroups that \nhave a stake at that level. Building on the extensive participation that has characterized the planning process, social \nmobilization during the implementation of the Project will facilitate each community through consultations to (i) form \ncommittees for each distributary channel and the collective structures such as closure embankments, (ii) ensure \nmeaningful participation of communities in the detailed design of their respective structures, and (iii) form Project \nLiaison Committees on each channel and collective structure to include representation from channel committees, field \nstaff of the Punjab Irrigation and Power Department, and the contractor responsible for the construction. These \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \ncommittees will oversee quality, timeliness, and mitigation measures of adverse impact including land acquisition.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen are as familiar with their natural environment and the behavior of hill torrents as men are and participate \nduring flood irrigation events in the immediate neighborhood of their embanked fields, physically applying water while \nmen concern themselves with the diversion weirs. Although women work in agriculture and livestock, contributing to \nhousehold income and quality of life, there is segregation between men and women in the public domain. \n \nThe Project will organize the management, primarily maintenance, of improved spate irrigation water tanks for \ndomestic use under the leadership and participation of women. \n \n \n \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?
