This capacity development technical assistance (TA) aims to address common public \nhealth and social problems encountered by urban communities in Indonesia and the Philippines \nthat are affected by toxic industrial pollution from informal backyard and formal micro, small, and \nmedium-sized industries. This support is in line with the fourth pillar of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) regional cooperation strategy, namely the provision of regional public goods.1  The \nTA is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for Indonesia for 2012\u2013\n2014.2 The second pillar of this CPS calls for support for environmental sustainability and \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation, including the management of river basins to improve \nwater quality and mitigate and manage floods. The TA also aligns with ADB\u2019s CPS for the \nPhilippines  for  2011\u20132016.  The  CPS  seeks  to  reduce  environmental  degradation  and \nvulnerability  to  climate  change  and  disasters  by  helping  the  government  gain  access  to \nconcessionary resources made available for greenhouse gas mitigation in the land use sectors \nat the global level; working with government and the private sector on possible public\u2013private \npartnership solutions; and improving sustainable environmental infrastructure in urban areas.3  \n \n2.  Indonesia\u2019s  Ministry  of  Environment  (MOE)  and  the  Philippines\u2019  Department  of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources (DENR), through letters of request dated 17 December \n2012  and  7  January  2013,  asked  ADB  for  assistance  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction (JFPR) to help pilot activities aimed at mitigating the industrial pollution and the \nresulting social and public health impacts caused by gold smelters, tanneries, and discarded \nlead batteries in certain urban areas. An ADB reconnaissance mission from 20 February to 8 \nMarch 2013, involved discussions with representatives and officials from the embassies of \nJapan, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency offices in Jakarta and Manila; the MOE \nand the State Ministry of National Development Planning in Jakarta; the DENR and the National \nEconomic and Development Authority in Manila; and the stakeholders from the proposed project \nsites.  The  stakeholders  included  nongovernment  organizations  and  community  and  local \ngovernment representatives. All the government agencies and organizations the mission met \nexpressed  full  support  for  the  project,  including  its  intended  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference,  and \nconcurred with the project design. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The interventions and environmental legislation of the governments of Indonesia and the \nPhilippines aimed at reducing industrial pollution have focused almost exclusively on heavy \nindustries in the formal sector. These activities have overlooked the widespread micro, small, \nand medium-sized industries that operate under little or no pollution controls in the two countries. \nThe negative effects of the pollution these enterprises\u2014and informal backyard industries in \nparticular\u2014impose  on  poor  and  marginalized  populations  living  in  high-density  areas,  on \nriverbanks, and in other residential areas near industrial zones have therefore escaped official \nresponse.  Operating  with  no  oversight  and  with  insufficient  knowledge  and  awareness  of \nenvironmental protection, these industries contaminate air, soil, and ground and surface water \nsources. This in turn affects the health of their workers, people in the immediate neighborhood, \nand downstream river network communities that often depend on the land and water resources \nbeing polluted for their domestic water and such livelihood and subsistence activities as fish \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006.

Soil contamination produced by these industries damages agriculture production in \nsuburban areas. Crops absorb the toxins, thereby contaminating food for human consumption. \nAir pollution from these industries reduces air quality and causes respiratory-related diseases in \nsurrounding  communities.  Urban  communities  are  affected  by  both  direct  exposure  to  the \npollutants and bioaccumulation through the food chain.  \n \n4.  Pollution in 70% of Asia\u2019s cities exceeds the levels recommended by the World Health \nOrganization and, by one account, has caused 800,000 premature deaths in the region in \n2005.5 Contamination of the environment by hazardous waste is a growing issue for low- and \nmiddle-income countries. An analysis of 164 contaminated sites between 2010 and 2011 in \nIndonesia and the Philippines estimated that the impact of diseases caused by toxic exposure is \nsimilar to that of malaria. The analysis reported that 161,582 (about three for every 1,000) \nchildren in these countries suffered from degraded mental and physical functions due to lead \nexposure from waste. Health impacts of toxic waste contamination hinder inclusive development \nby impairing the mental and psychomotor functioning of the poor and excluded in affected \nareas.6 Overall, the pollution of air, water, and soil reduces the productivity of communities by \nnegatively affecting their health, harvests, and catch, as well as the intellectual capacity of their \npopulations and the socioeconomic functions necessary for their residents to provide for their \nneeds.  \n \n5.  Lead and other heavy metal pollution that results from inadequately controlled formal \nand  informal  sector  battery  breaking,  recycling,  smelting,  and  related  activities  is  a  major \nenvironmental threat in urban areas throughout Indonesia. The recycling and smelting industry \nis poorly regulated and many operations are conducted in the open air in densely populated \nurban areas with few, if any pollution controls. In 2001, the MOE, along with the United States \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the United States Center for Disease Control, found that \n35% of school children tested in Jakarta had lead concentrations in their blood that were above \naccepted standards. A 2007 study found similar results in four other cities (32% in Bandung,   \n53% in Makassar, 40% in Palembang, and 18% in Surabaya). Lead contamination has caused \nsignificant health problems for the smelting plant workers and individuals from surrounding \ncommunities, often manifesting as nerve and mental function abnormalities. In the Philippines, \nthe river system running through the three municipalities of Marilao, Meycauayan, and Obando \non northern boundary of Metro Manila, poses a major pollution problem. The system in these \nmunicipalities is a major catchment for flows through Metro Manila that discharge into Manila \nBay. This river system is heavily contaminated by heavy metals, untreated wastewater, oil and \nchemical discharges from industrial establishments, which threaten the health and livelihoods of \nboth urban and rural communities.  \n \n6.  Such pollution creates gender issues.  Women are affected through the disruption it \ncauses in their daily routines or to their households budgets by compelling them to fetch clean \nwater from areas far from their houses or to buy it from peddlers. Some of the workers in \ninformal  smelting  plants  who  are  in  danger  of  suffering  pollution-induced  nerve  and  brain \ndysfunction are female.  \n \n7.  Inclusive growth cannot be achieved if the resources that communities depend on are \ndamaged by pollution. The TA activities to initiate environmental management measures will \ntherefore support inclusive growth in these pollution-afflicted areas.  \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2006.

This TA will help concerned government agencies and communities improve the quality \nof life of affected communities in the two countries, as well as the operations of micro, small, \nand  medium-sized  formal  and  informal  sector  industries  in  urban  areas.  The  TA  will  also \naddress climate change issues by helping to develop antipollution devices for smoke emissions \nfrom legal, small-scale smelting operations. If use of these devices is scaled up to cover a wider \ngeographic  area,  this  will  reduce the  amount of  greenhouse gas  emissions  released from \nsmelting operations. The areas where smelting industries are located are vulnerable to the \npollution  effects  of  climate  change  as  frequent  rains  could  increase  surface  run-offs  of \ncontaminated soil into the river systems. The TA will build on the outputs and studies of ADB TA \nthat supported the implementation of the Global Inventory Project7 in Asia and the Pacific,8 and \nanalyzed sites suspected to have been contaminated in Indonesia and the Philippines. These \nincluded the sites nominated for this project.9 The TA revealed that the top contaminants in \nurban areas and in the sites analyzed were produced by battery recycling, smelting, and leather \ntanning. These activities are often done in micro, small, and medium-sized establishments that \nare located within or adjacent to densely populated areas and discharge untreated effluents into \nsurrounding bodies of water and on agricultural lands. The TA project will also address the \nlessons learned from the  ADB Metro Manila Air Quality Improvement Sector Development \nProgram.10 The program eliminated lead concentrations from the Metro Manila air shed, but \nprogram completion report noted several shortcomings and loopholes in its design (footnote 10). \nThe program neglected economic and social dimensions of air quality management and the \nsustainability  of  capacity-building  initiatives,  pursued  complex  objectives  that  were \noverambitious, and resulted in a mismatch between the program expectations and the results \nthe executing and implementing agencies anticipated and had the capacity to deliver.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  expected  impact  will  be  improved  environmental  management  and  community \ndevelopment capacities in selected locations in Indonesia and the Philippines. The outcome will \nbe  awareness  and  increased knowledge  of and  institutional  capacities  on  how  to mitigate \nhazardous waste contamination created in pilot locations and among affected stakeholders.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  is  expected  to  bring  about  (i)  increased  awareness  within  governments, \ncommunities, and industries of the impact of toxic industrial pollution and of the need for and \ndependence on protecting available land and water resources; (ii) strengthened capacity of \ngovernments  and  other  stakeholders  on  integrating  environmental management  with  urban \ndevelopment; and (iii) sustainable strategies and measures, which are to be demonstrated \nthrough pilot activities in the project areas, to address the environmental and social issues \nbrought about by toxic industrial pollution and its effects on these communities. It is assumed \nthat mitigating environmental impacts of industrial waste pollution and contamination will remain \n                                                \n7  Blacksmith Institute. 2010.

However, there is also a possibility of reluctance from communities to adopt proposed \ncommunity interventions such as alternative livelihoods to do away with traditional smelting as \nvocation, or that governments and communities may lack the sustained commitment to continue \nthe TA activities after the project ends. ADB has limited experience in dealing with these \nenvironmental  issues.  That  is  why  the  services  of  highly  competent  consultants  with  vast \nexperience on industrial pollution mitigation will be engaged for the TA.   \n   \n11.  Output 1: Capacity assessment and awareness creation. The TA will assess the \nenvironmental management practices in the TA areas. This will be based on earlier capacity-\nbuilding and aid assistance initiatives involving stakeholders in such areas as water quality \nmanagement and environmental monitoring. The TA will focus on assessing the enforcement of \nindustrial hazardous waste disposal measures and conduct information drives regarding their \nimpacts  on  public  health.  Viable  strategies  to  disseminate  information  on  the  impacts  of \nindustrial pollution on public health will be designed.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Strategy and action plan formulation. This output will have two activities. \nFirst  is  the  preparation  of  two  strategic  urban  redevelopment  action  plans  that  will  cover \nstrategic  issues  on  toxic  industrial  pollution  in  each  participating  city.  The  plans  will  be \nsupplemented by policy dialogues. This will be followed by preparation of investment plans and \npolicy agenda to support the comprehensive urban redevelopment strategy. Second is the \npreparation  of  two  prefeasibility  studies  to  determine  viable  hazardous  waste  treatment \ntechnologies for micro, small, and medium-sized industries, including clean-up of contaminated \nsoil and water in affected land and water bodies and possible funding modalities.  \n \n13.  Output 3: Community development and institutional strengthening. This output will \nsupport the implementation of the comprehensive urban redevelopment strategies for the pilot \nareas in Indonesia and the Philippines through the following activities:  \n(i)  It will assess the immediate needs of the communities, alternative livelihoods, and \ntarget beneficiaries. \n(ii)  It  will  conduct  training  programs  on  alternative  livelihoods  and  a  training-of-\ntrainers  program  on  environmental  management,  in  partnership  with  local \nuniversities  and  research  institutions  and  based  on  the TA  project\u2019s capacity \nneeds assessment. \n(iii)  It will develop community development and livelihood support mechanisms to \nsustain alternative livelihood efforts. This will include the creation of community \nassociations  or  cooperatives  to  implement  mechanisms  that  will  help  support \nlivelihoods through activities such as microfinance and partnerships with private \nsector groups for job creation. \n(iv)  It will design an institutional framework and support mechanisms for integrated \nenvironment and urban land management. \n(v)  It  will  conduct  a  regional  workshop focused  on  the sharing  of  knowledge  on \ntechnologies  for  environmental  management  and  on  economically  successful \nenvironmental  management  projects,  particularly  those  closely  related  to  the \nissues being addressed by the TA. \n(vi)  It will prepare a guidebook on mitigation of hazardous waste for micro, small, and \nmedium-sized  industries  that  will  include  options  for  financing  environmental \nmanagement projects. \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by JFPR \nand administered by ADB.11 The cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015. \nADB will be the executing agency, with the ADB Urban Development and Water Division, \nSoutheast Asia Department acting as the focal, supported by the Sustainable Infrastructure \nDivision  of  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department.  The  implementing \nagencies in the two countries will be (i) the Office of Hazardous Waste, Hazardous Substance, \nand Solid Waste Management of the Ministry of Environment in Indonesia; and (ii) the Foreign \nAssisted and Special Projects Office of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources \nin the Philippines, with the support of the department\u2019s Environmental Management Bureau. \nThe pilot locations are the municipalities of Bogor and Tegal located in the peri-urban areas of \nthe Greater Jakarta Area, and the municipalities of Marilao, Meycauayan, and Obando in the \nPhilippine province of Bulacan. \n \n16.  ADB will procure a total of 114 person-months of consulting services from a firm with \ninternational and national consultants (34 person-months for international consultants, and 80 \nperson-months for national consultants). In addition, an individual urban development consultant \n(national) will be recruited for 8 person-months to provide project support within ADB during \nproject  implementation.  An  additional  4  person-months  of  individual  consulting  services  (2 \nperson-months for an international consultant, and 2 person-months for a national consultant) \nwill be procured for the preparation of a guidebook on mitigation of hazardous waste for micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized industries. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (March 2013, as amended from time to time). TA \nproceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (May 2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  implementing  projects  on  air  quality  and  other  fields  of \nenvironmental management has brought out lessons to build on for pursuing environment sector \ninnovations to support inclusive growth, such as this TA. In Indonesia, the MOE is currently \nworking with a nongovernment organization, the Komite Panghapusan Bensin Bertimbel, on \ninformation campaigns about the health impacts of lead contamination. In the Philippines, a \npossibility  exists  for  future  linkages  with  ADB\u2019s  proposed  solid  waste  management  sector \nproject. The project\u2019s activities are expected to complement the activities and intended outputs \nof the TA and support implementation of the water quality management plan prepared by the \nDENR and the Province of Bulacan for the Meycauayan, Marilao, and Obando river system.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the Mitigation of Hazardous Waste \nContamination in Urban Areas: Supporting Inclusive Growth, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n                                                \n11 All expenditures under this TA adhere to paragraph 15 (eligible expenditures) and paragraph 16 (ineligible \nexpenditures) of the JFPR 2013 Policy Guidelines.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2020:    Assumptions \nEnvironmental      Prefeasibility studies \nmanagement and  Capacity-building  Government reports and  translate into full feasibility \ncommunity development  programs are scaled up to  development plans  studies and public \ncapacities are improved in  four more municipalities in    investment projects.  \nselected locations in  Indonesia (from two pilot  MOUs and MOAs with   \nIndonesia and the  municipalities under the  universities/research  Industries are willing to \nPhilippines.
