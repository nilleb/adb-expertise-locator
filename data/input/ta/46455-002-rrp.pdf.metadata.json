I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant, and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the European Union (EU), \nboth to Nauru for the Electricity Supply Security and Sustainability Project.1 The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Tariff and Subsidy Policy Reform, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the TA. \n \n2.  The project will improve the quality and reliability of electricity service of the Nauru \nUtilities Corporation (NUC), Nauru\u2019s sole electricity utility. This will be achieved through the \ndelivery and installation of new diesel-fired generation to provide reliable base-load power for \nthe NUC, allowing it to retire older generation assets and perform scheduled refurbishment of \nexisting units to extend the service life of such units. The project will also repair the roof of the \nexisting structure housing the NUC\u2019s generators to shield them from the elements and provide a \nsafer working environment for NUC employees.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Nauru is a Pacific island country with a total population of 10,000 people. Access to grid \nelectricity is universal but the supply is unreliable because of underinvestment in, and poor \nmaintenance of, generation and distribution assets. The cost of generation is also extremely \nhigh because of the poor condition and inefficiency of the NUC\u2019s generators. The powerhouse \n(physical  structure)  is  also  in  poor  condition,  which  represents  a  vulnerability  to  Nauru\u2019s \nelectricity supply security. \n \n4.  Installed generation currently comprises eight units with a total nominal capacity of 12.90 \nmegawatts (MW). However, Nauru\u2019s current available capacity is only 3.70 MW because two \nunits are inoperable and the output of the remaining units is reduced because of their poor \ncondition. Current peak load is 3.75 MW. Scheduled service outages (rationing) are a constant \nfeature of electricity service in Nauru. Unscheduled outages due to faults are frequent. \n \n5.  As  in  other  Pacific  developing  member  countries,  Nauru  has  established  ambitious \ntargets for increasing the share of renewable energy generation in its system. But, as in other \nparts of the Pacific where significant intermittent renewable energy generation sources are \nbeing introduced into legacy diesel-based systems, Nauru will remain reliant on reliable and \nefficient thermal generation (i.e., diesel) for its base load, and for system stability and reliability, \nfor the foreseeable future. Nauru\u2019s current diesel generation equipment is neither reliable nor \nefficient. \n \n6.  Addressing reliability and efficiency shortcomings in Nauru\u2019s current diesel generation \nequipment  is  of  first-order  priority  to  improve  service  reliability  and  mitigate  the  risk  of \ncatastrophic failure of the NUC\u2019s power generation. The NUC\u2019s investment priorities include \nintroducing  3.0  MW  of  new  diesel-fired  generation  under  the  project  to  replace  existing \ngeneration, improve efficiency and reliability, and reduce fuel costs. The NUC estimates that this \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Electricity Supply \nSecurity and Sustainability (TA 8524-NAU). \n ", "2   \nwill result in a 20% improvement in generation efficiency from the existing 3.4 kilowatt-hours \n(kWh) generated per liter of diesel consumed to 4.1 kWh. \n \n7.  The consequences of the failings of Nauru\u2019s power system are far-reaching. The high \ncost of power generation is a significant burden on the state budget in the form of fuel subsidy to \nthe NUC (at least $7.0 million per year \u2013 24% of the 2011-2012 national budget of $29.5 \nmillion).  Development  assistance  resources  are  consistently  diverted  to  support  the  NUC, \nincluding for capital investments that would not be necessary (at least in such volumes) if the \nNUC\u2019s assets were better maintained. Nauru\u2019s consumers are frequently forced to endure \npower outages and some customers, especially commercial customers, have to resort to high-\ncost  independent  generation.  The  diversion  of  government  funding  to  prop  up  the  NUC\u2019s \noperations away from more productive social and infrastructure investments (e.g., education \nand health care) and the high cost of independent generation (where available) has negative \nimpacts on Nauru\u2019s development and the quality of life of its inhabitants. \n \n8.  For the NUC to operate sustainably  while avoiding diversion of scarce government \nfunding to subsidize its operations, it must be able generate sufficient revenue to cover its long-\nterm costs, including a prudent maintenance and capital investment program. The adoption of \nan appropriate tariff structure, with due consideration of the legitimate needs of some of Nauru\u2019s \npoorer residential customers, is crucial for the NUC\u2019s transition from being a perennial burden \non the government budget to becoming a solvent, efficient power utility. \n \n9.  Providing for this transition and improving the NUC\u2019s operations will generate significant \nbenefits to Nauru\u2019s people and economy. The reduced burden on the state budget will allow its \nlimited resources to be directed towards more productive public investments (e.g., education, \nhealth care, or other infrastructure). The benefits of improved service reliability for household \nand commercial consumers of electricity are self-evident. Finally, provision of reliable base load \ngeneration will allow eventual integration of intermittent generation from renewable sources that \nwould not be possible with the current unreliable system. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project\u2019s impact will be increased economic activity\u2014all NUC customers will enjoy \nmore dependable supply with fewer outages, and the NUC will resume supply to commercial \nand industrial customers. The project\u2019s outcome will be increased reliability, lower cost, and \ngreater sustainability of power generation in Nauru. The incidence of power outages is expected \nto decrease by 50% by June 2016, and generation efficiency is expected to increase from 3.4 \nkWh per liter of fuel consumed to 4.1 kWh. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project will have three outputs: \n(i)  New diesel-fired generation put into service. A new, medium-speed, 2.6\u20133.0 \nMW diesel generator will be installed at the NUC, together with related auxiliary \nequipment; NUC personnel will be trained on its operation and maintenance. \n(ii)  Repair and/or replacement of existing roof and structural reinforcements of \nNUC\u2019s  powerhouse. The NUC powerhouse roof will be rehabilitated and all \nasbestos will be removed and safely disposed of. \n(iii)  Efficient project implementation. The NUC will be assisted by the design and \nsupervision consultants (DSCs) during project implementation. \n \n ", "3 \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n12.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $2.00 million from the Special \nFunds resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help finance the project. 3 \n \n14.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The project will be financed by a grant from ADB's \nSpecial  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund  [ADF])  of  $2.00  million,  and  a  grant \ncofinancing of \u20ac2.00 million ($2.70 million equivalent), to be provided by the EU, and fully \nadministered by ADB. ADB and the EU will conclude a cofinancing agreement and will finance \nproject costs on a pro rata basis.4 The government will provide contributions in-kind equivalent \nto $0.57 million, and in taxes and duties exemptions of $0.27 million. The government will make \nthe proceeds of the grants available to the NUC under a subsidiary grant agreement upon terms \nand conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \n                                                \n3  A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants under the revised grant framework is determined \nby its risk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Nauru had a high risk of debt \ndistress and was, therefore, eligible to receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n4  ADB and EU financing may finance local transportation and insurance costs.

Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  the  NUC  will  be  the \nimplementing  agency.  A  project  steering  committee  will  be  appointed  to  oversee  project \nadministration  and  implementation,  identify  and  remedy  issues  impeding  project \nimplementation,  and  provide  guidance  to  the  implementing  agency.  The  project  steering \ncommittee will comprise (i) the secretary of the Ministry of Finance (chair), (ii) the deputy \nsecretary for planning and aid of the Ministry of Finance, (iii) an advisor to the minister of \nfinance, (iv) the chief executive officer of the NUC, and (v) representatives from ADB and the \nEU. \n \n16.  The NUC will be responsible for implementation of the project and establish a project \nmanagement unit (PMU) that will be composed solely of NUC personnel. The PMU will be \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation of project components, including \n(i)  preparing an overall implementation plan and annual budgets; \n(ii)  overall interagency coordination; \n(iii)  participating  in  bid  evaluations  and  award  of  contracts  funded  by  the  grant \nproceeds; \n(iv)  preparing project safeguards document and implementing safeguard plans; \n(v)  project financial management and reporting; \n(vi)  consolidating, reviewing, and submitting regular progress and financial reports to \nthe executing agency, including the annual audit report and financial statements; \n(vii)  monitoring and evaluating project outputs and results; and \n(viii)  preparing withdrawal applications for the executing agency. \n \n17.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Except as ADB may otherwise \nagree, procurement of goods and works will be conducted through international competitive \nbidding procedures using ADB's standard bidding documents.5 The relevant sections of ADB's \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  documents  and \ncontracts. \n \n18.  Efficient project implementation support to the PMU will be provided by a DSC, serving \nas the project owner\u2019s engineer, to be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  form  time  to  time).  The  DSC  will  prepare  detailed \nengineering designs and bidding documents for all lots to be funded by ADB and EU grants; \nconduct bidding; respond to clarification requests; prepare a bid evaluation report; assist in \nnegotiations; and supervise supply, construction, and commissioning. \n                                                \n5  As the project will be financed with ADB-administered cofinancing resources, universal procurement will apply \n(ADB. 2013. Blanket Waiver of Member Country Procurement Eligibility Restrictions in Cases of Cofinancing for \nOperations Financed from Asian Development Fund Resources. Manila). ", "5 \n \n19.  To expedite project implementation, the executing and implementing agencies have \nrequested that all procurement actions up to the contract award to be funded under the grants \nbe managed by the DSC, and that ADB initiate advance procurement for the selection and \nappointment of the DSC. However, no contractual or financial obligations will be created until \nthe project has been approved by the ADB Board of Directors and the grants become effective. \nThe government, executing agency, and implementing agency have been advised that initiation \nof preliminary consultant recruitment actions does not commit ADB (or the EU) to finance the \nproject. \n \n20.  The project will be implemented over a period of 18 months, from January 2015 through \nJune 2016. No additional financing is contemplated at this time. Implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.6 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2015\u2013June 2016 \nProject completion date  30 June 2016 \nGrant closing date  31 December 2016 \nManagement   Project steering committee: (i) secretary, Ministry of Finance (chair); (ii) deputy \n  (i) Oversight body  secretary for planning and aid, Ministry of Finance; (iii) advisor to the minister \nof finance, Ministry of Finance; (iv) chief executive officer, NUC; (v) ADB; and \n(vi) the European Union. \n  (ii) Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n  (iii) Implementing agency  NUC \n  (iv) Implementation unit  A project management unit will be established within the NUC, comprising its \nchief executive officer, finance director, and generation manager. \nProcurement  ICB  Two lots: (i) diesel generator, and (ii)  $3.76 million \npowerhouse roof repair \nConsulting services (design  Fixed budget  18 months (intermittent)  $0.41 million \nand supervision consultant)  selection \nAdvance contracting  Preliminary recruitment of design and supervision consultant; no contract will \nbe awarded until grant effectiveness. \nDisbursement  All grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, NUC = Nauru Utilities Corporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n21.  To  complement the  project\u2019s  investments  in  the  NUC\u2019s  generation facilities,  and  to \nenhance the long-term sustainability and viability of the NUC as an electricity utility, ADB will \nprovide TA to develop recommendations for a revision to existing tariff and subsidy policy.7 \n \n22.  Consistent  with  the  Government  of  Nauru\u2019s  public  financial  management  reform \npriorities, the NUC\u2019s tariffs were recently raised across all customer classes. Nevertheless, \ntariffs still remain far below cost-recovery levels and are highly distortionary. As the government \npursues gradual reduction of direct and indirect subsidy to the NUC\u2019s power operations, the \ncorporation\u2019s revenues from tariffs will need to become sufficient to maintain its operations over \nthe long term. The proposed TA will help the government and NUC prepare a schedule of \ngradual tariff adjustments to support this, with a target of 50% cost-recovery from tariffs by \nDecember 2016. \n                                                \n6  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "6   \n \n23.  To support the NUC\u2019s long-term viability and the sustainability of the investments under \nthe proposed project, ADB will provide TA to the NUC and the Government of Nauru to develop \npolicy options for ensuring that the NUC\u2019s revenues from power sales are sufficient to cover the \ncost of power service to its customers. \n \n24.  The TA will (i) analyze and confirm the NUC\u2019s long-run marginal cost of electricity \nservice, consistent with established best practices for determining a utility\u2019s rate base, fixed \ncosts (including prudent maintenance and reinvestment costs), and marginal operating costs \n(e.g.,  fuel);  (ii)  identify  and  value  all  existing  subsidies  provided  to  the  NUC  from  the \nGovernment of Nauru, between and among the NUC\u2019s distinct operations (power, water, and \nfuel tank management operations) and to and among different classes of electricity customers; \n(iii) propose options for rebalanced power tariffs that provide for revenue sufficient to recover \nthe  NUC\u2019s  power  operations  costs  and  that  eliminate  embedded  cross-subsidies  between \nconsumer classes and between the NUC\u2019s distinct areas of operations (e.g., between power \nand water); and (iv) propose options for provision of a subsidy to residential customers to \nprovide for basic power service on a means-tested or proxy-means-tested basis, for which \nmeans-testing approaches will be elaborated and assessed for practicality of implementation. \n \n25.  The findings of the TA will be presented to the Government of Nauru, NUC, and other \nstakeholders in a report and presentation containing a recommended policy framework for \nadoption  by  the  government  and  a  practical  implementation  schedule.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented by ADB through consultants selected in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. \n \n26.  The TA is estimated to cost $225,000, of which $225,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n27.  The proposed investments in diesel generation and powerhouse roof repair have been \nassessed to be technically viable and appropriate to the NUC\u2019s needs. The optimal size and \nperformance  characteristics  of the  diesel generator  have  been  determined. The  necessary \nscope  of  work  for  repair  of  the  powerhouse  roof  has  been  elaborated.  A  2-year  post-\ncommissioning operation and maintenance and training contract will be concluded between the \nNUC and the diesel-generator supplier to provide capacity development of NUC staff to improve \nlong-term sustainability of the investment. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n28.  Economic. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is 48.30%, with a project \neconomic net present value of $10.50 million using a discount rate of 12.00% over a 25-year \nproject life cycle.  Economic benefits accrue from a reduction in operational expenses (including \nreduced fuel consumption), increased revenue from serving un-served load (reduced incidence \nof forced outages), and reduced reliance on more expensive self-generation by industrial and \ncommercial customers. Sensitivity analyses were performed assuming increases of 20.00% in \ncapital and operational expenses and decreases of 10.00% and 20.00% in tariff and fuel-\nefficiency levels, respectively. Under all plausible sensitivity scenarios, the project\u2019s economic \ninternal rate of return is robust, ranging from 18.80% to 44.70%. ", "7 \n29.  Financial. The project has a financial internal rate of return of 11.50% and a financial \nnet present value of $3.69 million using a financial discount rate equal to the weighted average \ncost of capital of 7.32%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that an increase in capital and operational \nexpenditures of 20.00% decreases the financial internal rate of return to 9.80%. The project\u2019s \nfinancial performance is most sensitive to a decrease in tariffs.  Though highly unlikely, a \n10.00% decrease in tariffs would produce a financial internal rate of return of 0.74% and a \nnegative financial net present value.   \nC.  Governance  \n30.  Sensitivity to tariff levels underscores the importance of tariff rationalization, which the \ngovernment has begun to implement through a 70.00% tariff increase effective July 2014.  The \nattached technical assistance will address further tariff and subsidy policy reform to support \nfinancial sustainability of the NUC. \n31.  Financial  management.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \nimplementing agency will approve and submit to ADB withdrawal applications from the PMU, \nassisted by the DSC, for direct payment procedure for all project goods, works, and services \nfunded under proceeds of the grants. A financial management assessment of the NUC was \nundertaken. While the executing agency\u2019s financial management practices and procedures were \ndeemed adequate for the implementation and operational phases of the project, those of the \nimplementing agency require urgent improvements that have been a covenanted condition of \nthe grant. The NUC does not currently have all the necessary capability for energy accounting \nor financial management. While the PMU will be responsible for project financial management \nand accounting, the DSC will assist the executing and implementing agencies in accounting for \nall  project  transactions,  including  in-kind  and  other  contributions  from  the  government. \n(Simultaneously, ADB TA is being mobilized, managed separately from the proposed grant, to \nassist the NUC in development of its asset management practices and systems.) \n \n32.  Procurement.  In  the  interest  of  time  and  efficiency,  procurement  activities  funded \nthrough  grants  proceeds  will  be  conducted  by  the  DSC.  The  PMU  will  participate  in  the \npreparation of the bid documents and evaluation of the bids. Signing contracts and contract \nmanagement responsibilities will remain with the grant recipient. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 7). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n34.  The  present  erratic  power  supply  is  a  constraint  on  economic  and  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. The entire population of Nauru will benefit from the project through more reliable \nelectricity supplies, and Nauru\u2019s economy will benefit from more efficient power generation. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  Environment (category B). The project works will have impacts that are site specific; \nnone of the foreseen environmental impacts are irreversible or cannot be readily mitigated. An \ninitial environmental examination has been undertaken.8 The project will undertake (i) delivery \nand installation of a new diesel generator, (ii) decommissioning and disposal of generators to be \n                                                \n8  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "8   \nretired, and (iii) repair and/or demolition of existing structures at the NUC\u2019s powerhouse and \ndisposal of waste material. These activities are expected to create only a small range of impacts, \nwhich are largely contained within the site owned and managed by the NUC and which can be \nmitigated  through  the  measures  set  out  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  and \nenvironmental management plan. The NUC have assigned staff to the PMU, which will be \nresponsible for overall project implementation, including the environmental management plan. \nThe DSC will support the PMU as the owner\u2019s engineer, and will also assist in implementation of \nthe environmental management plan. \n \n36.  Involuntary  resettlement (category C). The project is not expected to involve  any \nphysical displacement or relocation of people. All activities will be undertaken at the existing site \nof NUC\u2019s powerhouse, and will not require additional land acquisition. No resettlement plan is \nrequired per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The majority of the population in the project area is \nnot considered to be distinct from the mainstream society.
