The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide (i) project preparation support \nto a series of ensuing urban sector projects in South Asia during 2019\u20132022, and (ii) capacity \nbuilding and project implementation support to a series of ongoing projects.1 The ensuing projects \nbeing prepared by South Asia Department\u2019s Urban Development and Water Division (SAUW) \nalign with the operational priority of Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Strategy 2030 of building \nlivable cities that are green, competitive, inclusive, and resilient.2 The projects will contribute to \nintegrated, sustainable, and smart urban development in the region; and promote and showcase \ninnovations. Embedding innovations and ensuring efficient implementation will require thorough \ntechnical, safeguard, governance, financial management, and economic due diligence; and \ncompliance with advance contracting and readiness requirements set by ADB and its developing \nmember countries (DMCs) in South Asia. Large efficiency gains can be achieved by using a \ncombined facility approach for the development of multiple projects under a single cost center. \n \n2.  The transaction TA facility will strengthen the implementation of ongoing projects by \n(i) enhancing  contract  management  and  the  project  implementation  capacity  of  selected \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  by  providing  consultant  support  and  tailored  project \nimplementation trainings;3 (ii) enabling effective responses to any unforeseen challenges such as \nproject  restructuring,  additional  scoping,  innovations,  or  value-addition  needs  during \nimplementation, which may not be adequately addressed by loan consultants; (iii) providing stop-\ngap support, especially for procurement, in the interim period when loan consultants are not yet  \nmobilized; (iv) providing specialized consulting support that may not have been anticipated during \nproject conception and approval;4 and (v) supporting policy reform through additional policy \ndialogue. Other vital components of the proposed TA facility are sharing best practices through \njoint forums and coalescing operational knowledge into valuable knowledge products. DMCs \nhighly appreciate this type of additional support mechanism made available through the previous \ntransaction TA, which has contributed significantly to successful project implementation.5 \n \n1.  Delivering Solutions through Innovative Approaches \n \n3.  Between 2010\u20132015, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka urbanized at \nan  average  annual  rate  of  1.8%\u2014double  the  world  average  of  0.9%.6 This  accelerated \n                                                \n1  The TA facility will support projects in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. A list of ensuing and \nongoing projects supported by the TA facility is in Appendix 2. The ensuing projects are listed in the relevant country \noperations business plans. This TA facility is not in the current regional cooperation operations business plan and/or \ncountry operations business plan of the countries involved in the TA. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n3  Poor capacity in contract management and construction supervision results in poor contractor and consultant \nperformance and low-quality works. \n4  In Sri Lanka, for example, a highly experienced procurement expert developed useful recommendations for \nenhancing procurement efficiency in one of the executing agencies by comparing the procurement processes of \nseveral national agencies. The supported projects include ADB. 2015.

New York. \n ", "2 \nurbanization trajectory is causing serious deficits in the provision of adequate urban infrastructure \nand  services.  Uncontrolled  urbanization  presents  a  serious  challenge  to  designing  and \nimplementing innovative, citywide, multisector, and technically complex projects, especially when \ncoupled with systemic weaknesses in a very complex, multi-stakeholder urban ecosystem. \n \n4.  The sector pipeline for the five countries in 2019\u20132022, estimated to include up to 20 new \nloan approvals with a combined loan amount of up to $2.6 billion, aims to fill critical infrastructure \ngaps and respond to the demands of clients and of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 toward making cities \nmore livable and embedding innovations in projects. The deployment of technologically advanced \nsolutions and big data analytics, along with enabling communication through multiple interfaces \nwith the use of the internet of things, can achieve (i) greater efficiencies in resource utilization and \nservices delivery; (ii) enhanced climate resilience and sustainability; and (iii) improved customer \nsatisfaction\u2014making  cities  in  these  five  countries  more  livable.  The  injection  of  adequate \nresources up front for project preparation and enhanced readiness is key to applying some of \nthese innovations in projects. \n \n5.  This transaction TA facility combines the key features of project preparatory, loan-tied or \nassociated,  and  capacity  development  TA  projects,  thereby  enabling  more  efficient  TA \nmanagement and greater flexibility in the range of solutions offered to DMCs under a single \nresource envelope. The tedious administrative requirements of hiring several firms and individual \nconsultants will be bypassed, using framework agreements for firms and individuals. This will \nexpedite consultant mobilization, enhance competition, reduce transaction costs, and shorten \nrecruitment time for repeated assignments of a similar nature.7  \n \n6.  Capturing, documenting, and sharing tacit knowledge from operational experiences are \nvital components of the transaction TA facility. This objective aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nwhich positions ADB as a key knowledge provider in the region and beyond. Knowledge products \nwill deliver practical knowledge solutions that are fit for purpose and identify key operational \nlessons and good practices replicable throughout the region. Knowledge forums bringing together \nregional stakeholders will facilitate knowledge transfer from outside the region on smart city \nsolutions and their integration into ongoing and proposed projects. \n \n7.  The transaction TA facility incorporates a holistic approach, encompassing innovations for \ndeveloping livable cities projects, enhancing climate resilience in urban infrastructure, improving \nproject readiness, strengthening project implementation and institutional capacity in DMCs, and \ndelivering operationally specific knowledge solutions. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Livable cities projects made investment ready. The transaction TA facility \nwill provide preparation support to pipeline projects to ensure they are innovative, investment \nready, and aligned with the principles of governments\u2019 sector strategies and of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030. This will include  the due diligence of ensuing projects, covering technical, financial, \ngovernance, institutional, safeguard, and climate resilience aspects.8 The facility will provide \nsupport for advance procurement to ensure that ensuing loans meet the readiness criteria \ndemanded for the consideration of the ADB Board of Directors. Specific deliverables will include, \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2018. Guidance Note on Procurement: Framework Agreements for Consulting Services. Manila.

Guide \non the Use of Framework Agreements for Entities Administered by ADB. Manila. \n8  Technical feasibility will include assessments of the viability of integrating smart solutions into project design. \n ", "3 \nwhen required, (i) economic analyses; (ii) financial management assessments and financial \nanalyses; (iii) procurement capacity assessments, contract packaging, and the preparation of \nprocurement  plans  and  bid  documents;  (iv)  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plans; \n(v) gender  analyses,  including  the  collection  of  baseline  data  and  gender  action  plans; \n(vi) environmental safeguards documents; (vii) resettlement plans and frameworks, including \nindigenous  peoples  plans  and  planning  frameworks;  (viii)  urban  sector  assessments;  and \n(ix) climate risk and vulnerability assessments. Output 1 will also include capacity building on ADB \nprocedures and modalities, especially of executing and implementing agencies working on ADB-\nfunded projects for the first time. \n \n9.  Output 2: Project implementation improved. Under the TA, consulting support will be \nprovided to executing and implementing agencies to strengthen implementation capacity and to \naccelerate key institutional reforms such as tariff increases under existing projects. Support will \nbe demand-driven and tailored to the specific needs of project agencies, with priority given to \nspecialized areas of support outside the scope of loan consulting services (para. 2). The design \nand monitoring frameworks of ongoing projects are unlikely to be affected as a result of this \nsupport. Where highly specialized support is provided to any project, design and monitoring \nframeworks will be updated to reflect the outputs and activities of the transaction TA facility. The \nupdated versions will be provided in project administration manuals. Output 2 will also respond to \nany ad hoc requests from the participating DMCs to inject innovations into projects and for project \nimplementation support. In addition, the TA  will provide gap-filling consulting services to ease the \ntransition from project processing to project implementation. Where needed, implementation \ncapacity will be strengthened through the delivery of bespoke training programs.9 \n \n10.  Output 3: Knowledge shared and solutions delivered. The transaction TA facility will \nsupport the preparation, sharing, and dissemination of best practices and prepare knowledge \nproducts that capture tacit operational knowledge. SAUW will work closely with ADB\u2019s urban and \nwater sector groups, and with relevant thematic groups, such as on gender and health, to collect \nand disseminate appropriate best practices, innovative approaches, and lessons learned from \nSAUW projects. The transaction TA facility will also facilitate knowledge sharing by organizing \nworkshops and national and regional conferences to expose DMC counterparts to the latest \ntechnological advances in smart cities development and discuss opportunities to integrate new \ntechnologies in their urban development. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $4,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 1. \n \n12.   The governments were informed that approval of the TA facility does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. The scope of the TA facility is expected to be expanded to cover \nadditional support consistent with its outputs, and will be replenished from time to time when funds \nare required and identified or when cofinancing from trust funds becomes available. \n \n                                                \n9  Such as on gender, safeguards, project implementation, contract management, and financial management. The \neffectiveness of training will be monitored by measuring the \u201creaction,\u201d \u201clearning,\u201d \u201cbehavior,\u201d and \u201cresults\u201d phases of \ncapacity building, using, for example, the Kirkpatrick Model. Results will be traced with appropriate questionnaires, \nsurveys, and interviews. \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA facility through SAUW. TA activities under output 1 will start \nonly after ADB approves the project concept paper on the ensuing projects. Activities for output 2 \non helping DMCs implement ongoing projects, and for output 3 on supporting knowledge work, \nmay commence upon approval of the TA facility. The TA facility will be implemented over \n48 months and is expected to commence no later than August 2019. \n \n14.

Consulting services. ADB will engage consultants following the ADB\u2019s Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.10 For project preparatory assignments, four-six firms will be empaneled \nthrough framework agreements prequalifying them for a period of up to 3 years to provide advice \non subsequent assignments. The empanelment process will follow the standard quality- and cost-\nbased selection method (ratio 90:10) based on a full technical proposal. For each assignment, \nthe empaneled firms will be invited to prepare a technical and a financial proposal for evaluation \nby SAUW. A total of 145 person-months (86.5 international and 58.5 national) are expected to be \ncontracted to the empaneled firms. The consultants will render a combination of home and field \ninputs. Framework agreements will also be used for engaging 6 person-months of services from \ntwo home-based individual international consultants to support project documentation and the \nediting of knowledge products. A national procurement management consulting firm will be \nengaged through a simplified technical proposal for transactional support requirements. An \noutput-based contract with milestone payments will be used. The inputs will be office-based. ADB \nwill also engage individual consultants (two international for 6 person-months and eight national \nfor 115 person-months) using individual consultant selection. Individual consultants will support \n                                                \n10 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "5 \nknowledge management and day-to-day project and TA administration.

Individual \nconsultants and consultant firms will be engaged to the extent possible to support more than one \nproject. \n \nE.  Governance \n \n16.  As ADB is the executing agency, financial management, procurement, and integrity risks \nduring implementation are assessed to be low. However, thorough assessments of financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  integrity  risks  posed  by  ensuing  investment  projects \nimplemented in any of the target countries will be conducted under the TA facility. \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.
