THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Primary Health Care Improvement Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project will support the government\u2019s health service optimization process, \nwhich aims to improve and expand the primary health care (PHC) services delivered in rural areas. \nThe process will bring health services closer to the people and improve early diagnosis, treatment, \nand chronic care with the goal of achieving healthy life expectancy and productivity. The project \nwill strengthen the rural health sector by providing newly established rural family polyclinics with \nmodern equipment and health workforce development to expand their service delivery. The \nproject will be supported by tools to monitor the government\u2019s broader PHC reform efforts and \nwill include the pilot test of a digital health management information system (HMIS) in a rural \nregion. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Country profile. Uzbekistan is a middle-income country of about 32 million people, almost \ntwo-thirds of whom live in rural areas. Uzbekistan\u2019s economy has grown 7.6% per year on average \nduring 2012\u20132016, which has resulted in an increase of per capita gross national income from \n$420 in 2003 to $2,220 in 20161 and a decline in the poverty rate from 14.1% in 2013 to about \n12.5% in 2016.2 Despite sustained high economic growth, rural\u2013urban disparities remain. Rural \nhousehold income in 2015 was 46.0% of the national average. In 2017, the government adopted \na 5-year national development strategy, which sets out five priority areas: (i) governance and \npublic administration; (ii) rule of law and the judicial system; (iii) economic development and \nliberalization; (iv) social development; and (v) security, tolerance, and foreign policy.3 The strategy \nidentifies inclusive growth and continued economic diversification as key to its reform objectives. \n \n4.  Health sector policy and performance. When Uzbekistan declared its independence in \n1991, its health system needed significant restructure and reform to meet existing and future \nhealth needs. It was centralized, aging, and hospital-dominated; and its workforce could not meet \nthe future needs of the population. It needed to transition to new forms of management, financing, \nand health care provision. \n \n5.  Uzbekistan recognized these challenges and placed high importance on sector reform, \nstarting with PHC reform in 1999. Under the State Health System Reform Program, it improved \nand modernized health infrastructure, trained staff, and pilot-tested financing and management \nreforms  to  promote  innovation.  Substantial  investment  in  tertiary  care  resulted  in  the \nestablishment of multi-profile pediatric and regional hospitals, and the upgrade of district and 10 \nother specialized hospitals. With the help of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World \n                                                \n1  World  Bank  Open  Data.  Uzbekistan.  Gross  National  Income  per  Capita,  Atlas  Method  (current  US$) \nhttps://data.worldbank.org/country/uzbekistan (accessed 4 September 2017). \n2  World Bank. 2017.

Tashkent (7 February). \n \n ", "2 \nBank, reforms, particularly structural and financing, have continued with the implicit aim of \nimproving accessibility, equity, and quality of care through health system strengthening.4 \n \n6.  The health indicators show significant and continuous improvement since 1991. In 1990\u2013\n2015, major improvements were seen in the maternal mortality ratio and the under-5 and infant \nmortality rates. During the period, the maternal mortality ratio fell from 66 to 36 per 100,000 live \nbirths; the mortality rate for children under 5 years declined from 48.2 to 15.1 per 1,000 live births; \nand the infant mortality rate dropped from 35.5 to 11.4 per 1,000 births.5 \n \n7.  However, the health indicators for noncommunicable diseases (chronic ones like cancer \nand diabetes), especially for cardiovascular disease (CVD), show alarming trends with escalating \npremature mortality and morbidity rates.6 CVD, which causes premature death and loss of \nproductive life years, is estimated to cause more than 45% of all annual deaths worldwide7 and is \nthe leading cause of adult mortality in Uzbekistan.8 CVD-specific mortality rates for men (238 per \n1,000 people) are significantly higher than those for women (133 per 1,000 people) largely \nbecause of CVD risk differences.9 To reduce risks and improve mortality rates, Uzbekistan needs \nto improve and bring PHC services closer to patients. \n \n8.  Health system financing. Public spending on health care marginally increased between \n2010 and 2014 both in absolute terms and in relative terms (as a proportion of total government \nexpenditure, gross domestic product, and per capita). Total health expenditure as a proportion of \ntotal public expenditure increased from 8.67% in 2010 to 10.74% in 2014. Health expenditure per \ncapita increased from $75.74 to $124.11 in real terms, indicating a commitment to strengthen the \nsector.10 In 2012, the country spent 5.9% of its gross domestic product on health. In the same \nyear, public financing sources (mostly raised through taxes) accounted for 53.1% of total health \nspending,  with  the  remainder  coming  mostly  in  the  form  of  out-of-pocket  expenditure.11 \nUzbekistan funds secondary care on an input basis and is increasingly self-financing through user \nfees. PHC is funded predominantly through tax-based public financing, and, as laid down by policy, \nall citizens are entitled to a package of care, including services to cover chronic conditions.  The \nplanned social health insurance system and ongoing PHC reforms will help improve financial \nsustainability of the health system. 12 The private sector plays a small part in Uzbekistan\u2019s health \nsystem and is unlikely to provide these improved services because of the low rate of revenue \nreturn. \n \n9.  Primary health service delivery. Inequalities and differences in the health status and \nability of the population to access health services are seen between people living in urban and \n                                                \n4  The national priority areas in health policy included the protection of maternal and child health, the prevention and \ncontrol of infectious diseases, the protection of the environment, and the strengthening of tertiary care services. \n5   Ministry of Health statistics, 2016. \n6  Global Health Data Exchange.

Modern diagnostic equipment will help establish risk-based systems in Uzbekistan. \n9  Before menopause, women are significantly less vulnerable to heart disease than men. Post-menopause, however, \nthe mortality risk for female and male equalizes. Current equipment cannot detect microvascular heart disease, which \naccounts for most heart attacks of post-menopausal women. Modern diagnostic equipment will be able to detect it. \n10 World Bank.

Tashkent (1 April). \n \n ", "3 \nrural areas. The PHC segment still faces problems of service quality and availability in general, \nbut specifically in rural areas. In 2017, a presidential decree outlining a restructured health service \ndelivery system accelerated progress in PHC reform efforts.13 Before the decree, PHC was \nprovided through rural health points that offered very limited health care and diagnostic services, \nwhich led people, particularly those in rural communities, to seek health care from higher-level \nclinics or hospitals. These health facilities are typically far from their homes, and the cost of the \ncare they provide, both to the government and to the individual, is higher. The service optimization \nprocess of the Ministry of Health (MOH) will consolidate PHC services and establish 793 rural \nfamily polyclinics. The optimization process aims to (i) increase the availability of a wider spectrum \nof health services not currently available to rural populations and (ii) prevent people from \nbypassing PHC facilities for nonemergency care to reduce the overutilization of secondary and \ntertiary health facilities. \n \n10.  Rural family polyclinics. Rural family polyclinics will provide improved health services \nthrough modern equipment and a well-trained health workforce, and will become a key component \nof the PHC system. Polyclinics are PHC facilities that provide general and specialist health \nservices, including diagnosis, to people on an outpatient basis. They are independent of hospitals \nand ideally provide 60%\u221270% of the population\u2019s health needs. \n \n11.  Rural family polyclinics will be in every district of the country. Their site was determined \nby MOH and was based on a population analysis (about one clinic per 10,000 residents) and/or \nthe distance between clinics. In less populated districts, clinics obviously will service fewer people \nbut will be within reach. Decommissioned rural health points will be converted to housing for health \nstaff to attract staff to rural areas and allow longer operating hours. The project will not carry out \nany civil works because the existing clinics are in sufficiently good order to use the modern \ndiagnostic equipment now, and all the equipment is portable. \n \n12.  The project will support government efforts to improve PHC services by providing key \nequipment and training for the 793 newly established rural family polyclinics.14 The equipment \nthat will be procured under the project is not currently available in the rural PHC system. The \nequipment, and training on its use, will increase the chances of overcoming Uzbekistan\u2019s key \nhealth challenges, particularly those relating to CVD, antenatal care, and disease prevention. \nMatching an investment in equipment with training to increase the diagnostic and therapeutic skill \nof PHC staff will contribute to more equitable distribution of the health workforce, increase the \nquality  of  diagnosis  and  reduce  the  irrational  use  of  drugs,  reduce  inappropriate  hospital \nadmissions, and increase the availability of health services in rural areas. Improving diagnostic \nand therapeutic interventions significantly strengthens a country\u2019s health system. \n \n13.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project aligns with the United Nations Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal (SDG) 3 on universal health coverage (UHC)15 and SDG 5 on universal access \nto reproductive health.16 The project will promote SDG 3\u2019s clear focus on equity, including equity-\nfocused monitoring and evaluation, to help ensure that targets are being met and that no one is \nbeing left behind, and to contribute toward achieving SDG 5. A strong health system is needed to \nmeet  these  SDGs,  and  expanding  and  optimizing  the  scope  of  PHC  services  through \n                                                \n13 Government of Uzbekistan. 2017. Measures of Improving the Organization of Activities of Primary Medico-Sanitary \nCare Institutions in the Republic of Uzbekistan. Presidential Decree No. PP-2857. Tashkent (1 April). \n14 ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Electronic Healthcare Development Project (TA 9148-\nUZB, $800,000, approved on 5 August 2016). \n15 WHO defines UHC as all people receiving the health services they need without suffering financial hardship. \n16 SDG 5\u2019s indicator 5.6 is to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. \n \n ", "4 \ninfrastructure or equipment investments also needs to be linked to a health system improvement \nframework.17 The project will apply the UHC monitoring framework of ADB and the World Health \nOrganization (WHO), which will provide an opportunity to monitor the performance of the health \nsystem and its reforms and to ensure that the investments will help achieve UHC in Uzbekistan.18 \nThis framework would not have been incorporated without ADB financing. MOH will be able to \nuse the results provided to refine policies and programs and help reduce inequities in service \naccess, coverage, and health and well-being. \n \n14.  Link to national development strategy and ADB sector priority. The project aligns \nclosely with Uzbekistan\u2019s national goal of improved quality of life and better services and its health \nstrategic plans.19 It is in line with ADB\u2019s  country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for \nUzbekistan20 and paves the way for a long-term programmatic approach consistent with ADB\u2019s \nhealth operations plan.21 \n \n15.  ADB experience and lessons learned. The project directly builds on the achievements \nand lessons learned from ADB\u2019s previous support for the health sector. In 2004, ADB approved \na sovereign loan of $40 million for the Woman and Child Health (WCH) Development Project, \nwhich demonstrated the \u201cimportance of (i) strong commitment by the government, (ii) close \ncollaboration among development partners, and (iii) prompt response to changing client needs \nduring implementation. The leadership provided by MOH and the project coordinator was a key \nto the project\u2019s achievements. The project was not a stand-alone WCH but a part of broader health \nsector reforms. Strong collaboration among partners and responsiveness to actual needs was an \nimportant contributor to the success of the various programs.\u201d22 \n \n16.  Development coordination. Under previous health projects financed by ADB and the \nWorld Bank, MOH established a joint project implementation bureau (JPIB) and development \npartner coordination mechanisms.23 Implementation of the project will be closely coordinated with \nthe projects of other development partners\u2014such as the third and fourth health projects of the \nWorld Bank, which are also procuring equipment\u2014to ensure that there is no duplication of \nprocurement. 24 In addition, the project team will work closely with WHO and the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) to monitor the PHC reform and adapt the ADB\u2013WHO UHC monitoring \nframework for Uzbekistan. \n \n                                                \n17 A health system needs staff, funds, information, supplies, transport, communications, and overall guidance and \ndirection to function. Strengthening health systems means addressing key constraints in each of these areas. \n18 ADB. 2016.

The project is aligned with the following impact: level of hospitalization, incidence, and \ndisability of populations in service areas reduced (footnotes 3 and 13). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: availability25 of PHC services in rural areas expanded.26 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n18.  Output 1: Health services in family polyclinics in rural areas strengthened. This \noutput will provide equipment to each of the newly established family polyclinics. Each polyclinic \nwill receive the same set of equipment, which has been selected based on a needs assessment \nand health indications. The set of equipment will include (i) a digital diagnostic ultrasound unit for \nantenatal  care  or  noninvasive  examination  of  internal  organs  or  vessels;  (ii)  a  12-lead \nelectrocardiograph for noninvasive routine examination of the heart, which can identify underlying \nheart  conditions;  (iii)  an  ophthalmoscope  for  eye  examinations  and  an  otoscope  for  ear \nexaminations; (iv) surgical instruments for minor surgical procedures for conditions that can be \ntreated quickly and easily using only local anesthetic; (v) gynecology and midwifery instruments \nto improve birth outcomes, cancer screening, and reproductive health; (vi) a dental chair and \nbasic dental equipment (vii) a home-visit bag and equipment for nurses to provide home patient \ncare; (viii) a weighing scale with height measurement for physical assessment; and (ix) a \ncomputer and printer to facilitate service data reporting. The project will make sure that all \nprocured equipment will be registered with and maintained by MOH\u2019s National Maintenance \nCenter, which opened in 2017. \n \n19.  Output 2: Capacity of polyclinic staff enhanced. This output will provide training to \nabout 2,700 health technology operators, doctors, and nurses at family polyclinics to ensure their \ncompetence in using the equipment and to improve their diagnostic and therapeutic skills. This in \nturn will help improve the quality of care, and public trust in and use of PHC services; and \nultimately  reduce  morbidity  and  mortality.  Under  this  output,  Uzbekistan\u2019s  medical  training \ninstitutions will be provided with the necessary training and equipment to institutionalize the skills \nof their health staff. \n \n20.  Output 3: PHC monitoring tools institutionalized. This output will provide monitoring \ntools to monitor and strengthen the performance of the country\u2019s health system. The project will \npilot-test a digital HMIS, which will incorporate clinic management, in  the rural region of Sirdaryo, \none of the country\u2019s 12 regions. The HMIS developed during the pilot could be readily incorporated \nin all regions in the future. MOH began a similar HMIS pilot in 24 urban PHC facilities in May 2017. \nExcept for the pilot rural region, monitoring in all other regions will use current paper-based data \ncollection and reporting mechanisms. Monitoring will help ensure that the investments contribute \nto the achievement of UHC. The monitoring tools will incorporate the same core health and service \nindicators, whether digital or paper, so they can be directly compared. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n21.  The project is estimated to cost $58.8 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).27 \n                                                \n25 WHO defines this as the availability of good health services within reasonable reach of those who need them, and \nwhere other aspects of service organization and delivery allow people to obtain the services when needed.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 27). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2018\u2013April 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 October 2020 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 April 2021 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  The MOH will chair the steering committee, which will comprise the PIU project \nmanager and representatives from MOF, MOH, funding agencies, and development \npartners (WHO and UNICEF).

Retroactive financing is required to \nestablish the PIU, including staff, and mobilize the international procurement expert. It \nwill not amount to more than 20% of the total ADB loan amount.b  \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the \ngovernment and ADB.c  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MOF= Ministry of Finance, MOH = Ministry of Health, PIU = project implementation \nunit, WHO = World Health Organization, UNICEF = United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. \na  ADB has advised the government that approval of advance contracting will not commit ADB to subsequently approve \nfinancing for the project. \nb  ADB. 2005.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  During project preparation, the ADB extensively reviewed the rationale for and technical \nspecifications of the medical equipment requested by MOH. The assessment and health indicator \ndata  suggest  a  solid,  evidence-based  rationale  for  the  proposed  equipment.  The \nelectrocardiograph, for example, will help identify underlying heart conditions, which is the leading \ncause of adult mortality. MOH will be able to maintain the equipment, which is suitable for local \nconditions. Providing the equipment together with the training will provide an opportunity for the \n ", "8 \nPHC system to overcome key health challenges relating to CVD, antenatal care, and disease \nprevention; and strengthen the country\u2019s health system. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  Economic. The project will assist the government in creating strategic and long-term \nchanges to achieve healthy life expectancy and productivity in the country. The project will directly \nbenefit the rural population, particularly poor and vulnerable groups, including women and girls \nand the medical staff of 793 rural polyclinics. To reflect the true value of the US Dollars (USD), \neconomic benefits and costs are expressed in terms of Purchase Power Parity (PPP) at 2017 \nbase rate, operation and maintenance (O&M) costs were assumed at 3% of the total equipment \ncost, and the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) was improved by 10%.30  These \nimprovements are reflected in the economic rate of return of 16.8% and a net present value of \n69.6 million, which indicate that the project is economically viable. \n \n29.  Financial. Financial analysis confirmed that the government has the adequate budgetary \nresources to fulfill its financial obligations under the project.31 The total annual project cost as a \nproportion of the government\u2019s total annual expenditure ranges from 0.02% in 2018 to 0.12% in \n2019, before decreasing to 0.01% in 2021. As a proportion of the government\u2019s total health \nexpenditure, the total annual project cost ranges from 0.26 to 0.06% over the same period. The \ntotal project cost is significantly less than 1.0% of total government health expenditure. The \nfinancial sustainability analysis indicated the government has sufficient capacity to cover annual \nO&M costs and debt service requirements beyond the implementation period. Spending on O&M \nis key to maximizing the life of the equipment being purchased under the loan, and the risk of \nensuring adequate financing for O&M needs to be monitored closely. The government has a \ndemonstrated track record of maintaining the medical equipment which was provided under \nADB\u2019s previous health project and have recently established a National Maintenance Center. \nThey have committed to providing post-warranty maintenance through this center and the budget \nallocation for it is outlined in ministerial orders. Except for the ultrasound machine, all equipment \nis considered robust and will require limited O&M over its life. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n30.  The financial management risk is moderate mainly because the government has only \nrecently  introduced  an  internal  audit  system  and  new  measures  for  financial  control  and \naccounting. MOH has extensive experience in the administration of external development partner \nand  donor  funded  projects.  The  head  of  the  JPIB  staff  has  10  years  of  experience  with \ndevelopment partner and donor funded projects. The JPIB continues to coordinate World Bank \nprojects and will be the model for the structure and operations of the PIU for this project. MOH \nand staff from the States Investment Committee all have experience in complying with ADB \nstandards for financial management and procurement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOH. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 27). \n \n                                                \n30 The DALY measures the overall disease burden, which is expressed as the number of years lost from poor health, \ndisability, or early death. One DALY is considered as one lost year of healthy life. The sum of these DALYs across \nthe population can be thought of as a measurement of the gap between the current health status and an ideal \nsituation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability. \n31 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  Uzbekistan faces complex public health challenges, including socioeconomic inequities, \nescalating health care costs, and a changing disease profile. Overall, 13.7% of the population \nlives below the national poverty line. Health improvements have multiplicative effects in reducing \npoverty, improving learning and productivity, and accelerating economic growth. In addition, \ninclusive growth, sustainable economic development, and national and regional health aims are \nimportant policy objectives that cannot be achieved without a healthy population, a strong health \nsystem, and reliable PHC services across the country.32 \n \n32.  The project has been classified gender equity as a theme because it will directly improve \naccess of women and girls to better health services.33 Gender is a significant variable for \nunderstanding the impact of disease and poor health. Women and girls have other health needs \nthan men and boys. Men and women also have different disease vulnerabilities and may have \ndifferent levels of access to or understanding of information on disease prevention and treatment. \nADB\u2019s country gender assessment for Uzbekistan identified some of the numerous complex \ngender issues related to health. The paucity of sex-disaggregated data makes it difficult to analyze \ngender-differentiated patterns of access to health care and social protection measures, and acts \nas a critical impediment for targeted and gender-sensitive social policies and health services for \nthe poor.34 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \nclassification  is  category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples.35 Environmental impacts during project implementation are expected to be minimal or \nnonexistent. Minimal health care waste may be generated by some of the equipment, but all rural \nfamily polyclinics already have health care waste facilities, policies, and protocols in place, as well \nas sterilization equipment and policies and procedures to manage it. Since the project will not \ncarry out any civil works, no involuntary resettlement is envisaged. The project will not have an \nimpact on indigenous peoples as defined in the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n34.  The project\u2019s risk assessment did not identify risks that were rated high. Substantial risks \nand mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.36 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Substantial Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \n3.1  Incomplete financial reporting and  Under new internal audit procedures and recently \nmonitoring.  revised accounting standards, the government has \nFinancial reporting of income and expenditure is  put in place specific financial reporting steps to \nnot produced automatically and cannot be easily  ensure accurate accounting.
