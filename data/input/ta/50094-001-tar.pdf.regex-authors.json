INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  macroeconomic  advisory  support  and  crisis  management  to \nprovide flexible and timely knowledge products, advisory services, and capacity development \nsupport to the government to enable it to respond effectively to emerging policy and capacity \ndevelopment needs associated with the implementation of Mongolia\u2019s economic stabilization \nplan (ESP).1 ADB fielded a mission to Mongolia from 28 September to 7 October 2016 and \nreached  an  understanding  with  the  government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference for consultants.2 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA is included in the ADB country operations \n \nbusiness plan, 2016 for Mongolia.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Mongolia\u2019s economy is characterized by limited diversification and a high dependence \non the  mining sector, which  in turn relies  heavily  on foreign  direct  investment (FDI). This \nexposes the economy to external shocks, in particular swings in commodity prices and the \neconomic cycles of its trading partners. The external environment is currently unfavorable, and \ncharacterized by falling commodity prices and growth moderation in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, which are adversely affecting Mongolia\u2019s mineral production, exports, and fiscal revenue \ncollection. This is compounded by a sharp decline in FDI\u2014it decreased by 80% in 2014\u2014as a \nresult of weak investor confidence; the decline in FDI has delayed the start up of large revenue-\ngenerating mining projects. \n \n3.  Depressed FDI inflows have triggered balance of payments pressures and currency \ndepreciation, which increased the cost of dollar-denominated debt. To meet its external financial \nobligations, the government consumed a large share of its foreign exchange reserves and \nborrowed  heavily  from  market  sources.  Total  public  debt  increased  from  32.7%  of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in 2012 to 77.4% in 2014. Currency depreciation and loose monetary \npolicy aggravated domestic inflation, with the consumer price index reaching a peak of 15.4% in \nJuly 2013. Against this background, GDP growth declined to 7.8% in 2014 from 17.5% in 2011. \nThe government  launched  expansionary fiscal and monetary  policies  during  2012\u20132013 to \nstimulate  the  economy;  these  failed  to  significantly  spur  growth  but  aggravated  the \nmacroeconomic imbalance.  \n  \n4.  The weakening growth momentum is continuing, and ADB estimates that GDP growth \nfell to a rate of 0.3% in 2015. The economic slowdown has resulted in job losses and eroded \nincomes,  in  particular  among  vulnerable  and  poor  populations,  which  have  been  always \ndisproportionally affected during crises. Government spending during the first 7 months of 2016 \nwas 32.6% higher than in the first 7 months of 2015, while revenues were 3.1% lower, resulting \nin a fiscal deficit equal to 8.5% of the 2015 GDP; this significantly exceeded the 12-month 2016 \ndeficit target, and the Fiscal Stability Law ceiling of 4%. A budget amendment and a revised \nfiscal framework for 2016\u20132018 were approved in late August 2016 by the new government \namid  worsening  fiscal  pressures,  largely  from  off-budget  expenditures,  and  several  fiscal \nconsolidation measures were enacted. The government nevertheless estimates that the fiscal \n                                                \n1  Following the ESP implemented in 2013, the government set up a task force on 9 August 2016 to develop a new \nESP to counter fiscal and external pressures, amid a continued depreciation of the togrog. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 November 2016. \n3   ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2016. Manila. \n ", "2   \ndeficit will reach 18.2% of GDP in 2016, up from 7.9% in 2015. Public debt is projected to \nexceed 90.0% of GDP by the end of the year, excluding central bank liabilities. \n   \n5.  The balance of payments is also under pressure. Merchandise exports fell by 9.6% year \non year from January to July 2016, while imports declined by 17.0%, yielding a higher trade \nsurplus and a narrower current account deficit. This helped trim the overall balance of payments \ndeficit to $46 million. Supported by newly issued external public debt, gross foreign exchange \nreserves  were  $1.3  billion  at the  end  of  June,  equal to  3.2  months of  import  cover. The \ndeteriorating economic outlook accelerated currency depreciation. As of the end of August, the \nMongolian togrog had depreciated by 11.2% since January.  \n \n6.  The  new  government,  in  power  since  late  June  2016,  has  reacted  swiftly  to  the \nchallenges by undertaking policy actions to address the implications of the deteriorating outlook. \nAn amended budget containing fiscal consolidation measures has been submitted to Parliament. \nTo arrest currency depreciation the central bank raised the policy rate by 4.5 percentage points \n(to 15.0%) in August. A new government action plan (the ESP) has been prepared focusing on \nshort-term actions to address the major challenges, combined with longer-term strategies to \nsupport Mongolia\u2019s development needs. \n \n7.  A comprehensive, systematic adjustment  approach is needed to build on the initial \nactions that have been taken. Determined policy actions are essential to contain the growing \nfiscal and balance of payments pressures and restore macroeconomic stability. Specifically, the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to develop its budgeting technique and debt management capacity is \ncrucial to improve overall fiscal management. Moreover, the economic slowdown underscores \nthe importance of strengthening social protection in Mongolia as the ESP could have a short-\nterm contractionary effect. Reductions in the welfare budget can reverse poverty reduction gains, \nforcing  some  people  who  were  among  the  non-poor  into  poverty,  and  others  who  were \npreviously poor back into poverty. While consolidation of social welfare programs should be \npursued, continued support to those vulnerable should not be undermined during the economic \nadjustment. \n \n8.  Effective macroeconomic management is essential to restore confidence in the economy. \nGiven the increasing level of nonperforming loans, prudential standards and capital adequacy in \nlocal banks should be strengthened to maintain the soundness of the banking system. The \ninvestment climate will benefit from the implementation of reliable and predictable policies and \nregulations on foreign investments. If properly managed, FDI inflows and mineral resources will \nsupport Mongolia\u2019s long-term growth potential.  \n \n9.  Mongolia\u2019s  long-term  economic  prospects  remain  promising,  given  the  abundant \nresource wealth and untapped potential in the agriculture sector. While economic reforms under \nthe ESP starting next year are primarily designed to stabilize the macroeconomic situation, \nthese will lay the foundation for effective mining revenue management in the medium term. \nADB\u2019s TA will support the government\u2019s efforts to strengthen its policy. The crisis provides \nopportunities for  the  country  to  establish  a  solid  linkage  between  its resource  wealth  and \neconomic prosperity through more effective macroeconomic management. In this context, timely \neconomic policy advice and capacity development for crisis management at key government \nagencies are essential. This is to build on ADB\u2019s substantial past engagement in the provision of \npolicy advice and capacity building support.  \n \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be economic policy formulation enhanced and effective implementation \nof the ESP accomplished. The outcome will be core policies supported under the TA adopted \nand implemented by government agencies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA facility design provides a flexible framework that allows some subprojects to be \nselected during TA implementation. This flexibility will enable the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and \nADB  to  respond  to  emerging  development  issues  and  supplement  other  ADB  operations \n(nonlending and lending products) in a timely manner. ADB can respond to the government's \nemerging needs through frequent consultation and the use of flexible mechanisms to govern \nproposal submission and consideration. Subprojects will be selected jointly by the government \nand ADB. The criteria for prioritizing policy-related subprojects include that the subproject (i) \nsupports priority government policy reforms and is consistent with the Mongolia interim country \npartnership strategy for 2014\u20132016, as well as the country partnership strategy that is under \npreparation;4 (ii) is related to the implementation of the government action plan and the ESP, \nparticularly  in  the  areas  that  concern  key  development  constraints;  (iii)  is  considered  an \nemerging, urgent, and high-priority issue where ADB has considerable potential to add value; \nand (iv) shows evidence of strong government ownership, such that a small amount of strategic \nADB assistance will help advance or realize important reforms and/or leverage the outcome and \nimpact of existing projects.  \n \n12.  Priority will also be given to capacity development subprojects that support cooperation \nbetween the Government of Mongolia and ADB in solving key development constraints to \nrestore macroeconomic stability and protect the poor and vulnerable from the impact of the \ncrisis and the ESP. Activities will be divided into two categories\u2014policy advice and capacity \ndevelopment\u2014overseen by MOF, in close consultation and coordination with the implementing \nagencies, ADB, and stakeholders to maximize synergies and minimize overlaps. Agreement has \nbeen reached on seven subprojects, as outlined in Supplementary Appendix A (available on \nrequest). \n \n13.  Output  1:  Core  policy  issues  addressed  and  recommendations  made. The TA \nsubprojects  will  provide  government  agencies  with  advisory  services  based  on  agreement \nbetween  MOF  and  ADB  on  priority  development  issues  in  different  sectors  and  subjects, \nincluding (i) implementation of the ESP, (ii) macroeconomic stability, (iii) fiscal consolidation, (iv) \nsocial sector reform, and (v) other priority sectors as agreed jointly by the government and ADB. \nActivities will include organizing conferences, seminars, and workshops on international best \npractices in core reform area. The indicative allotment for this output category is $700,000.  \n \n14.  Output  2:  Capacity  development  training  opportunities  for  work-level  staff \nprovided. The TA subprojects will strengthen the development and management capacity of \ngovernment  agencies  through  organizational  diagnostics,  capacity  assessments,  training \nprograms, workshops, conferences, and knowledge management interventions. The indicative \nallotment for this output category is $300,000. Specific projects under this component will be \ndecided through joint consultations between MOF and ADB.  \n                                                \n4 ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2012\u20132016. Manila. \n ", "4   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff  remuneration,  office  accommodation, \nlogistics and administrative support, and other in-kind contributions. Subprojects will be subject \nto a maximum of $150,000 each, unless this ceiling is waived by MOF and ADB.  \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  TA support for workshops may include costs related to the venue, equipment rental, \ntranslation,  printing  and  copying, food  and  nonalcoholic  beverages,  transportation,  lodging, \nlogistics and administrative support, and other agreed expenditures with prior written approval \nfrom ADB. Disbursements under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Subprojects may also fund \nsurveys, field investigations, and the purchase of required resource materials, based on cost \nestimates agreed by ADB. In line with standard ADB procedures, the TA will not support \nimplementing agencies' management fees, overhead, or related costs such as staff salaries and \nallowances, or the use of implementing agencies' resources (such as office accommodation), \nwhich will be provided as part of the counterpart contribution. \n \n17.  MOF will be the executing agency with responsibility for oversight and coordination of \nsubproject activities, to ensure strong coordination with other government agencies. The TA will \nbe implemented for 25 months from 1 December 2016 to 31 December 2018. ADB will assist \nthe executing agency in overall TA operations, and TA review missions will be conducted to \nhelp monitor progress. \n \n18.  The TA will engage experts whose inputs will be equivalent to 20 person-months of \ninternational  consultants  and  20  person-months  of  national  consultants,  and  15  resource \npersons  engaged  for  workshops  and  seminars.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  individually \nfollowing ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nADB  will  endorse  the  required  expertise  and  terms  of  reference,  including  duration  and \nexpected results, at the time of joint identification of subprojects or during implementation. \nDetailed terms of reference for the individual consultants will be further developed in close \nconsultation with MOF, the implementing agencies, and ADB staff. The terms of reference are in \nAppendix  3.  All  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). To speed up implementation, \nADB may establish an advance facility for MOF and the implementing agencies, as needed, \nand/or utilize direct payment (e.g., for workshop venues). \n \n19.  The TA will be monitored regularly by the ADB Mongolia Resident Mission and through \njoint reviews of TA activities with the government during the implementation period.  TA outputs \nwill be shared with core government agencies and disseminated to a wider audience, including \ndonor partners and civil society through workshops and seminars during TA implementation.   \n \n \n ", "  5 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for Macroeconomic Advisory Support, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpacts the TA is Aligned with \nEconomic  policy  formulation  enhanced  and  effective  implementation  of  the  emergency  stabilization  plan \naccomplished.
