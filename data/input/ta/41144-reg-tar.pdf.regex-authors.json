While the economies of developing member countries (DMCs) continue to grow rapidly, \nrecent research has found that inequalities in standards of living are widening and the benefits \nof growth are bypassing the poor. The special chapter of the Key Indicators of Developing Asian \nand  Pacific  Countries  20071,  based  on  household  income  and  expenditure  survey  data  of \nDMCs, provides evidence that absolute inequality has increased in many countries in Asia, and \nthat the incomes of the rich have grown faster than those of the poor that the rich have grown \nricher faster than the poor. One way to address this problem is to improve the labor market \nopportunities for workers, because employment is the main avenue out of poverty. To cope with \npoverty, the poor engage in informal employment such as subsistence jobs, secondary jobs, \nand occasional jobs. This type of labor has grown in many DMCs, making the informal sector a \nmajor component of their economies. The Interregional Cooperation on the Measurement of \nInformal Sector and Informal Employment (ICMISIE) project2 estimates that the informal sector \naccounts for more than 50% of nonagricultural employment and about 30% of nonagricultural \ngross domestic product in many countries. Consequently, understanding and measuring the \ninformal sector is vital to improving the labor market opportunities for the poor. \n \n2.   This regional technical assistance3 (RETA) proposes contributing to the understanding \nand measurement of the informal sector by (i) examining existing data collection strategies and \nidentifying the most  appropriate  and sustainable strategy  for DMCs; (ii) assisting DMCs in \ndefining  workable  procedures  in  integrating  data  collected  from  the  informal  sector  in  the \ncompilation of national accounts; and (iii) conducting data-intensive research on the relationship \nbetween poverty and the informal sector. The RETA design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Measurement of the informal sector is difficult because of its nature and composition. \nThe informal sector comprises (i) households with at least some market production; and (ii) \nproduction units with low levels of organization and technology, and with unclear distinction \nbetween  labor  and  capital  or  between  household  and  production  operations.  Other  typical \ncharacteristics of these units are high mobility and turnover, seasonality, lack of recognizable \nfeatures  for identification, and reluctance to share information. These units usually are not \ncovered by establishment or enterprise surveys, because they are not included in the sampling \nframes for these surveys.4 However, these units might be covered by household surveys, which \nusually do not include questions pertaining to production. Because of these issues, informal \nsector statistics are not collected through the regular survey system of national statistical offices \n(NSOs). Therefore, informal sector statistics can be compiled only through special surveys for \nthis purpose. \n \n                                               \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2007, Key Indicators of Developing Asia and Pacific Countries, Manila \n2  ICMISIE is a multiyear and multilateral development account project of the United Nations, with the Economic and \nSocial Commission for the Asia and Pacific as the lead agency. This project is being implemented in Economic and \nSocial Commission for the Asia and Pacific, Economic and Social Commission for West Asia, and Economic \nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean in close collaboration with the United Nations Statistics Division, \nInternational Labor Organization, Economic Commission for Europe, Economic Commission for Africa, and the \nDelhi Group (United Nations Expert Group on Informal Sector Statistics).  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 17 July 2007. \n4 The coverage of the list of establishments or enterprises (or the sampling frame) usually depends on a certain \nthreshold of employment size or gross revenue. \n ", "2   \n4.  Since data on the informal sector and informal employment are not available regularly, if \nat all, the national accounts statistics cannot cover this sector, resulting in distorted estimates of \nthe structure of the economy. This lack of information also hinders the understanding of policy \nmakers\u2014in government, the private sector, and the public\u2014about many social and economic \nissues related to informal sector activities, such as lack of social protection; limited access to \ncredit, training, and markets; and differentials in wages and working conditions. As such, the \npolicies and interventions that are formulated and implemented to reduce poverty by generating \ndecent work might not result in the desired outcome. \n \n5.  The collection of data on the informal sector can take many approaches\u2014independent \nsurveys, mixed household\u2013enterprise surveys, labor force or other household surveys, or the \nexpansion of coverage of establishment surveys and economic censuses. Developing countries \nwith limited public funds cannot sustain many of these approaches, because conducting regular \nnational surveys requires sizeable budgets. However, many of these same countries have large \ninformal sectors and informal employment that need to be measured.   \n \n6.  The  available  statistics  for  those  few  countries  that  have  incorporated  questions \npertaining to the informal sector into their labor force surveys (LFSs) might not be comparable \nwith other countries because of differences in definition and concepts. The definition of the \ninformal sector was established at the 15th International Conference of Labor Statisticians, \nwhile the definition of informal employment was established at the 17th conference. However, \ncountries  have  not  applied  these  definitions  uniformly. An  examination  of  the  International \nLabour  Organization  database  reveals  differences  in  countries\u2019  practices,  data  collection \ncoverage,  operational  definitions,  and  data  collection  methods.  For  example,  while  non-\nregistration  of  an  enterprise  is  one  of  the  factors  used  to  determine  if  an  enterprise  or \nestablishment  is  part  of  the  informal  sector,  registration  requirements  vary  widely  across \ncountries and might change over time within a country. Another factor is employment size. It is \noften  assumed that small firms usually  are not well organized  and have limited access to \ntechnology  and  therefore,  should  be  classified  under  the  informal  sector.  However,  this \nassumption is not accurate for all enterprises, especially those that specialize in outsourcing \ninformation technology. In addition, governments determine the employment size threshold for \nother purposes, such as taxation and industry policies for some countries.  \n \n7.  Recognizing that a standard definition cannot be imposed  on all countries, ICMISIE \nadopted  a  unified  data  collection  strategy  that  uses  household  unincorporated  enterprises \nengaged in market production (HUEMs)  as the unit of  analysis. This  strategy captures  all \nrelevant enterprise characteristics for identifying an informal sector enterprise based on at least \ntwo sets of criteria\u2014the country\u2019s, as well as that of the International Conference of Labor \nStatisticians and the United Nations Expert Group on Informal Sector Statistics (or Delhi Group), \nwhich was constituted in 1997 to harmonize national definitions of the informal sector to improve \ninternational  comparability.  This  approach  is  different  from the  usual  survey  approach  that \nselects informal sector enterprises based on a set of predetermined criteria. \n \n 8.   The  unified  data  collection  strategy  proposed  a  two-stage  sampling  design  for  the \nsurvey. The first stage would be an enhanced LFS that identifies HUEMs and their location. This \ncould  be  used  as  a  sampling  frame  for  the  second  stage  and  for  estimating  informal \nemployment. The second stage would be a survey of the HUEMs that collects statistics on \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nproduction  in  line  with  international  recommendations  on  industry,  construction  trade,  and \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \ns ervices statistics. As the first stage of selection is designed to estimate labor force statistics, \nthe HUEMs might be distributed unevenly for the second stage selection. Hence, the strategy \n ", "  3\nmight result in less-efficient estimates than those from independent informal sector surveys. \nMethodological research, therefore, is needed to address this important issue. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The RETA\u2019s intended impact is to contribute to the increase in evidence-based policy \nmaking for poverty reduction. For outcomes, the RETA is expected to (i) provide NSOs with a \nsound strategy for collecting data from the informal sector; (ii) support the integration of informal \nsector  survey  results  into  the  compilation  of  national  accounts  statistics;  and  (iii)  enable \nagencies  involved  in  planning, monitoring,  and  evaluating  poverty-related  policies  to  better \nunderstand the relationships between poverty and the informal sector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  To  achieve the desired  outcomes, the RETA will have three major components: (i) \ndevelopment of the data collection strategy, (ii) data collection and analysis, and (iii) economic \nand  methodological  research  using  the  informal  sector  survey  data.  The  RETA  will  be \nimplemented in three countries\u2014Armenia, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. These countries were \nselected because they have (i) an existing LFS with a sufficiently large sample of households, \n(ii) an informal sector that is perceived to be growing, and (iii) not been supported by ICMISIE.   \n \n11.  The unified data collection strategy that ICMISIE is implementing seems to be the most \nappropriate for DMCs with limited budgets for surveys. However, because the LFS sampling \ndesigns  vary  across  countries,  methodological  studies  have  to  be  conducted  for  each \nparticipating DMC to optimize the current LFS design and to develop the sampling design for \nthe second-stage survey (HUEMs survey) such that it can be conducted by NSOs with limited \nbudget. Appropriate estimation procedures, including survey weights, also will be established.  \nExisting survey instruments for the LFS will have to be revised to include variables necessary \nfor identification of HUEMs in the second stage.   \n \n12.  Limited funds and technical advice will be provided to participating NSOs to cover the \nadditional questions for the first stage of the unified data collection strategy, as well as the \npreparation, conduct, and processing of the HUEMs survey (second stage). Survey data will be \nanalyzed to generate informal sector statistics and to provide data support for the second and \nthird components of the RETA.  \n \n13.  The United Nations Statistics Division is updating the 1993 system of national accounts \nto  provide  guidance  on  the  treatment  of  the  informal  sector  in  national  accounts.  These \nguidelines  will  be  studied  to  allow  them  to  be  implemented  in  the  selected  DMCs. \nImplementation  will  involve  the  determination  of  data  items  required  in  the  compilation  of \nnational accounts, and incorporation of them into the survey instruments for LFS and HUEMs. \nEstimation procedures also must be developed in accordance with the guidelines. Training will \nbe provided to concerned NSO staff. The resulting data series will be validated and discussed \nwith concerned government agencies. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n14.  An analytical model that will map the complex links between the informal sector and the \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nincidence of poverty will be developed using the results of the HUEMs survey. By comparing \n \nincome differentials of workers in the formal and informal sectors, research has shown a clear \nlink between poverty and employment in the informal sector. However, research has not yet \n ", "4   \ndetermined (i) the number of working poor, (ii) the number employed in the informal sector, and \n(iii) the prevalence of poor in the informal sector compared with the formal sector. The research \non poverty and the informal sector that will be conducted under this RETA will address these \nissues.  If  the  LFS  and  the  household  income  and  expenditure  survey  share  common \nrespondent households, these surveys can be linked and these questions can be answered \ndirectly. Otherwise, alternative statistical methods will be explored.  \n \n15.  The research papers, data collection strategy, survey instruments, and other relevant \nmaterials that will be produced will be consolidated into a publication that will be circulated \namong the NSOs and other relevant agencies in the region. To disseminate the important \nresults of this RETA, the publication also will be used as training material for workshops that will \nbe conducted for key staff of other NSOs with growing informal sectors. These workshops may \nbe  held  in  subregional  centers  to  reduce  travel  costs.  RETA  consultants  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) staff with strong backgrounds in analyzing household survey data, as \nwell  as  extensive  experience  in  designing  and  conducting  sample  surveys,  will  serve  as \nresource speakers for these workshops. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The RETA will cost an estimated $500,000. This total covers consulting services and \nfinancial support that will be provided to the NSOs of participating DMCs for the conduct and \nprocessing of HUEMs surveys, cost of publication, and training workshops. The RETA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program. The detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA, the administration of which will be the \nresponsibility  of  ADB\u2019s  Economics  and  Research  Department  (ERD).  The  RETA  will  be \nimplemented over 3 years from January 2008 to December 2010. ERD will coordinate with \nparticipating NSOs in developing a comprehensive schedule of activities for conducting and \nanalyzing the HUEMs survey. Moreover, ERD will coordinate with ICMISIE, including the Delhi \nGroup, to minimize duplication of tasks and optimize the RETA\u2019s limited resources.   \n \n18.  The amount of financial support for conducting and processing the HUEMs survey in \nparticipating DMCs will be decided in consultation with the NSOs based on the sample size, \nwhich will be determined from the results of the LFS. A memorandum of agreement will be \ndrawn up with the NSOs specifying the activities that will be undertaken for this RETA, as well \nas the financial and technical support that ADB will provide. ADB\u2019s support will include the \nprovision of technical advice for sampling design, preparation of survey instruments, training of \nenumerators and supervisors, and methodology for incorporating the HUEMs survey into the \nnational accounts.  \n \n19.  The RETA will finance 24 person-months of consulting services (international, 6 person-\nmonths; national, 18 person-months). The consultants will be selected and engaged individually, \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time).
