During the 1999 Country ProgrammingM  ission to the People's Republic of China\n(PRC),  the  Government requested technical assistance (TA )  for  project  performance\nmanagement and evaluation capacity building. In response to this request. a  Fact-finding\nMission visited the  PRC from 2-13 August 1999 and reached an  agreement with the\nGovernmento n the objectives,s cope. cost estimates,a nd implementationa rrangementsf or the\nTA  . Follow-upd iscussionsh  eld in October 1999 largely confirmedt he earlier agreements.T  he\nTA is included in the CountryA  ssistanceP  lan for the PRCf or 1999-2002.1\nII. BACKGROUNADND RATIONALE\n2.  The  process  of  building  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  capacity  has  been\nevolving  in the  PRC  since  the  early  1980s.  It was,  however,  not  until  1992,  when  the  China\nNational  Audit  Office  (CNAO),  the Ministry  of Finance  (MOF),  the State  Planning  Commission,\nand  other  key  central  agencies,  decided  to develop  specific  proposals  for  recommendation  to\nthe  State  Council.  The World  Bank and ADB  have supported  this process  by providing  a series\nof technical  assistance  for institutional  strengthening  and training.  The World  Bank  supported  a\nsteering  committee  composed  of  representatives  of  the  major  public  agencies  under  MOF\nleadership.  This  group  drafted  a proposal  with  various  alternatives  for an evaluation  system.  In\n1994, ADB  provided  a small-scale  T A to develop  project  performance  monitoring  and evaluation\ncapacity  in the PRC.2 Under the TA, evaluation  methodologies  were  developed  and training  was\nprovided  to selected  Government  officials.  Similar  objectives  were  pursued  through  a T A to the\nthen State  Devefopment  Bank.3 While the two T As focused  on selected  agencies,.  the third ADB\nT A looked  at evaluation  as a governance  function  and therefore  more as a generic  activity.5 The\nproposed  T A  continues  ADB's  support  for  building  performance  management  and  evaluation\ncapacity  in the PRC.\n3.  The  evaluation  system of the PRC involves many institutions. Evaluation units have\nbeen established  in most key central agencies. For example, the State  Development  Bank,\nMinistry of Construction, the China International Engineering Consulting Corporation (CIECC), a\nGovernment-owned  consulting  firm  with  close  links  to  the  State  Development  Planning\nCommission (SDPC), and others have set up evaluation units. In all these cases, the evaluation\nunits  are  located at  the  highest levels of each organization to  ensure  independence  from\noperational line responsibilities.\n4.  SDPC is at the apex of the country's planning and performance evaluation activities.s It\nis directed by the State Council to issue the regulations and to commission evaluation of public\n1  The TA first appeared  in ADB Business Opportunities (Intemet Edition)  in May 1999.\n2 TA  2133-PRC:  Developing  the  Performance  Evaluation  Capability  of the  People's  Bank  of China,  for  $100,000,\napproved  on 9 August  1994.\n3 TA 2664-PRC:  Institutional  Strengthening  of the State Development  Bank of China,  for $500,000,  approved  on 16\nOctober  1996. SOB changed  its name in 1999 to China Development  Bank (COB).\n4  The agencies covered by the TAs included the China National Audit Offlce (CNAO), State Planning Commission\n(SPC),  China  International  Engineering  Consulting  Corporation  (CIECC),  and State Development  Bank (SOB).\n5 TA 2821-PRC:  Strengthening  of Evaluation  Capacity  in the People's  Republic  of China, for $500,000,  approved  on\n4 July 1997.\ne While  CNAO  has an oversight  function  for instituting  evaluation  at all government  levels,  its evaluation  practice  is\nconfined  to financial  audits.", "2\nsector programs. In the process of a major reorganization in May 1998, SDPC established an\nindependent evaluation department, the Key Project Inspectorate Office (KPIO). Currently, 85\nKPIO staff monitor about 110 projects countrywide. As the number of projects will eventually\ngrow to 700, the staff strength is projected to increase to about 200 in the medium term. KPIO\nhas a full range of responsibilities within its mandate-all  facets of impact evaluation, including\nreviews of project design, monitoring of benefit development, bidding procedures, construction\nschedules, quantity and quality of physical progress as well as costs, prices, and fund utilization.\n.\nThe responsibility for the entire project cycle means the KPIO should be able to review project\nlogic and design, the monitoring of activities, evaluating operational performance, and assessing\na range of impacts. That the KPIO is not presently able to perform all these functions provides .\nthe rationale and necessity for the proposed technical assistance.\n5.  While proposals have been made from time to time to devolve evaluation responsibilities\nto  provincial  public  sector  agencies,  no  formal  links  have  yet  been  established  to  feed\nevaluation  information  to  other  key  government  functions,  such  as  public  expenditure\nallocations. This is the challenge to be addressed by SDPC in the future. The significance of\nperformance  management  and  evaluation  needs to  be  assessed  in  the  context  of  good\ngovernance.7 It emanates from the delegation of authority to subordinated line agencies that will\nbe held accountable for the accomplishments of tasks assigned to them. Thus, evaluation is a\nnecessary corollary to  results-based resource allocation. In the  PRC, this thinking  is slowly\nevolving. Currently, the emphasis of performance management is on inspection and control by\nthe central government\n6.  During the pastt wo yearso r so, projectp erformanceev aluationh as assumedr enewed\nurgency in the PRC. To stimulate domestic demanda nd to counter deflationaryt endencies in\nthe  economy, the  Government has  embarked on  a  massive program of  infrastructure\ninvestments~A t the same time, poor implementationre sultso f large public sector projects have\nheightened the awareness of the Governmentf or more rigorous performance management\nsystems. In February1  999,a   nationalc onferenceo n projectq ualityw  as promptedb y a series of\nsevere accidentsa nd projectf ailures relatingt o majori nvestmentp rojects.\n7.  The  human  resource  requirements  of  KPIO are  significant and  the  need  for  both\nqualified staff and training must be met as a matter of priority. Most KPIO staff has undergone\nsome training  at various  PRC universities and in the context of  external assistance.  KPIO\nmanagement has, however, expressed concern that this training is inadequate given the tasks\nahead. As KPIO is mandated with the training of future evaluators and project managers, it must\nfirst focus on building up a nucleus of qualified trainers within its folds. Currently  there is no\nI \nclear  notion of the competencies and skills that would be required for  project  performance\nmanagement. The formulation of job descriptions and the identification of the ensuing training\n.\nneeds will be key tasks of the TA  .\n.\nIII. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n8.  The overall objective of the TA   is to continue the process of building performance\nmanagement capacity within the  PRC administration.T  he focus will  be  on  the  central\nGovernance in general  and accountability  in particular  are addressed as key ADB concerns in the Country\nAssistance Plan for the PRC covering the period 2000-2002.", "3\ngovernmenlet vel to improve the ability of KPIO to develop its capacity and culture of evaluation.\nThe TA will enhance KPIO's abilities, skills and knowledge, procedures, and attitudes that will\nenable  it to  improve the effectiveness of public sector investments on a sustainable  basis.\nSpecifically.  the  TA    will  foster  project  performance  management,  including  diagnosis,\nmonitoring, and impact evaluation. A logical framework for the TA   is given in Appendix 1.\nB.  Scope\n9.  The scope of the TA will follow the recommendations and the action plan prepared under\nthe previous ADB TA. The TA will focus on human resource development of KPIO. The scope\ndefined by the terms of reference given in Appendix 2 will include:\n(i)  Training needs assessment which identifies skills and key competencies required\nfor KPIO staff;\n(ii)  Preparation of project performance evaluation guidelines. The guidelines should\ninclude the use of teaching methods and tools;\n(iii)  Based on the above activities, preparation of a training curriculum and a training\nprogram;\n(iv)  Implementation  of  training  activities:  training  will  center  on  seminars  and\nworkshops to be conducted in the PRC. A limited amount of the TA   funds will be\nprovided for overseas training;\n(v)  Evaluation of selected Bank-financed projects as case studies;\n(vi)  Forming a partnership with one or more international partner agencies that have\na comparable mandate;\n(vii)  Preparation in outline form of a program of activities for a follow-up  phase of\ncapacity  building  TA, which  would  focus  on  spreading  project  performance\nmanagement practices to provincial governments; and\n(viii)  Provision of office and training equipment.\nC.  Cost Estimates  and Financing  Plan\n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,120,000 equivalent, of which about $653,000\nwill be in foreign exchange, and about $467,000 in local currency equivalent. ADB will provide\n$900,000 equivalent, on a grant basis, from the ADB-funded TA   Program to finance the entire\nforeign exchange  costs and about $247,000 equivalent in local currency costs to  cover the\nremuneration of domestic consultants and expenditures of the in-country training activities. The\nGovernment will finance the remaining local currency costs covering office space, counterpart\nservices, translation,  and domestic transport. The cost estimates and the financing  plan are\ngiven in Appendix 3.\nD. Impleme ntationArrangements\n11.  A process approach will be adopted for the implementation of the TA  . This will allow\nadequate flexibility to determine and schedule the training activities and the required resources", "4\nin terms of consultant inputs and their financing. Flexibility is required to  accommodate  the\nfindings of the training needs assessment at the beginning of the TA, which will determine the\nsubsequent TA   activities.\n12.  KPIO  of SDPC  will  be the  Executing  Agency  of the TA. KPIO  has already  appointed  its\nDeputy  Director  as  project  manag3r.  A  technical  advisory  committee  will  assist  him.  A  local\nconsultant  will  act  as  TA  coordinator,  and  will  assist  the  committee  and  collaborate  with  the\n.\nforeign  experts.  A foreign  consultant,  who will visit the PRC on an intermittent  basis,  will monitor\nthe implementation  of the T A and will assist in the search for a foreign  partner  institution  and the\nsubsequent  forging  of a twinning  arrangement  with that partner.\n.\n13.  The need for other domestic and foreign consultants will be identified in the course of TA \nimplementation.  The  TA    will  require  inputs  of  about  23  person-months  of  international\nconsultants and about 30 person-months of local consultants. The TA   coordinator will be a local\nconsultant  who will  be  recruited as  an  individual. The foreign consultant  to  act  as  project\nmonitorer will be recruited as an individual. All consultants will be recruited based on ADS's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n14.  The World Bank Institute (WBI) will implementt he training component of the TA. WBI\nhas expressed keen interest in providingt he training and contributet o the overhead cost of the\ntraining in kind. However,W  BI will recover the operatingc osts incurred in this connectionf rom\nADB. Direct appointmento f the WBI is thereforee  nvisaged.C  ooperationw  ith WBI would add\nvalue to the TA  . The WBI has a comparativea dvantageo ver consultingf irms because of (i) its\nconsiderablee xperiencea  nd expertise in carrying out training projects, particularly training in\nevaluation and project performancem  anagement,( ii) its pool of experiencedp rofessionals taff\nwho would be made availablef or the TA; and (iii) the accessf acilitatedb y WBI of the trainees to\nthe World Bank's QualityA  ssuranceG  roup and the OperationsE valuationD  epartment.P  rior to\nthe commencemento f training, WBI will submit for ADB's approval a list of staff nominated\ntogetherw  ith the tasks assignedt o them and a trainingp lan.\n15.  The ExecutingA gency will be responsible for providing the required logistical support to\nthe TA, including the provision of office space, office support facilities, materials and equipment.\nIt will  procure  the  specified  TA  equipment  in  accordance with  the  ADS's  Guidelines  for\nProcurement,  make  domestic  travel  and  meeting  arrangements for  consultants,  translate\ndocuments, and provide any other inputs necessary for effective TA implementation.\n16.  To facilitate the payment of such items as per diem, travel, and other expenses incurred\nin connection with domestic training events, an advance payment facility will be established.\nThe Executing Agency will establish an appropriate accounting system and  controls for the\nadministration of the advance disbursement facility.\n17.  The TA   will be implemented over a two-year period. About one year upon inception, the\n.\nprogress of TA implementation will be subjected to a tripartite mid-term review. The Project\nManager assisted by the local coordinator and the foreign project monitorer will submit (i) an\ninception report within four weeks of TA   commencement; (ii) a progress report for consideration\nof the mid-term review; and (iii) a final report. Separate brief reports will be prepared on all\nmajor  training  activities. The  Project  Manager will  prepare an inception  and  a final  report,\nsummarizing the principal elements of cooperation and reporting on the progress, respectively.\nThe foreign monitoring consultant will submit a report upon comple~ion of each of the eight\nquarterly visits.", "5\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the People's Republic\nof China  in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 for the purpose of Project\nPerformance Management Capacity Building, and hereby reports sud1 action to the Board.", "I-WUJ:Z~<{..J<{(/)cn(/)l-<{ZUWu.~~w~0Ix:~\n(/) Z.a~ e ... f -e ,~ cG Q) L.- ~  - - ~ wC ~ '0 tn ,- ~u ... cG cG- 0'-.Q ~ -lit Q)  >-- ~- Q) 'C CGI; CU  tn cG - ,- 00 _C  \u00ab  tn cG - tn '2 ~  E~ 0.:; ;tn ~ 0VI _.a ~ \n0 0 . - .  \nI'- -~ 0> -- Q)... -III EE 0. eQ) > C - - w '\" - .CoO Q)C .51U  0.
