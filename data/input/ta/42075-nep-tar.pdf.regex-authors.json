During the country programming  mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \nJanuary  2008,  the  Government  of  Nepal  requested  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to \nstrengthen the capacity of the Public Procurement Monitoring Office (PPMO). ADB granted the \nGovernment\u2019s request and included the TA in its country operations business plan for 2008.1  A \nTA fact-finding mission was fielded from 29 May to 6 June 2008. A wrap-up meeting was held \non 6 June 2008, chaired by the joint secretary of the Ministry of Finance. The mission agreed \nwith the Government on the purpose, outputs, methodology, key activities, costs and financing \nplan, implementation arrangements, and scope of counterpart support.2  The TA design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since  the  end  of  the  decade-long  conflict  and  the  signing  of  the  peace  accord  in \nNovember  2006,  there  has  been  huge  demand  from  the  people  for  quick  delivery  of \ndevelopment results from the Government. It is important that the people\u2019s aspirations are met \nfor the peace and prosperity of the country, and that the development results are visible on the \nground. Hence, the Government has embarked on major development projects that require \ntransparency, accountability, economy, and efficiency. Good governance is one of the major \npillars in the Government\u2019s 3-year interim plan (2008\u20132010).3  The Government is committed to \nobtaining maximum value from public expenditure through an improved public procurement \nsystem. Experience in other countries has shown that a sound public procurement system has \ncontributed to 15% savings in public expenditure. In Nepal, where government procurement \ncomprises  about  15%  of  gross  domestic  product,  such  savings  would  boost  the  budget \nsignificantly and could be utilized to help meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  \n \n3.  The Government\u2014together with ADB, Department for International Development of the \nUnited Kingdom, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and World Bank\u2014conducted a joint \ncountry portfolio review mission in September 2006. The mission identified three major themes \nas pivotal factors to improve project implementation and enhance portfolio performance in Nepal: \n(i) financial  management,  (ii)  results-based  reporting,  and  (iii)  procurement  management. \nSubsequently, the Government promulgated the Public Procurement Act (PPA) in January 2007 \nand approved the Public Procurement Regulations (PPR) in August 2007. These initiatives have \nbeen an important step in reforming the procurement system\u2014thereby establishing the basic \nprinciples of procurement of transparency, open and fair competition, economy, and efficiency.  \n \n4.  More  importantly,  the  Government  established  PPMO  in  August  2007  as  a  central \nagency responsible for developing and sustaining a well-functioning public procurement system. \nPPMO is headed by a secretary and has 18 full-time staff. The major activities initiated by \nPPMO so far are (i) briefing of the PPA and PPR to all secretaries of line ministries; (ii) selection \nof members for the procurement review committee; (iii) training on procurement at the regional \nand center level; (iv) establishment of procedures on debarment hearings; (v) networking for \nestablishing a website; and (vi) support to all procuring entities. \n \n5.  A joint workshop organized by the Government, ADB, and World Bank in May 2007 \nconcluded that there is an urgent need for TA to support PPMO for effective implementation of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 June 2008. \n3  National Planning Commission. 2007. Three-Year Interim Plan (2008\u20132010): Nepal.  \n ", "2   \nthe  PPA  and  PPR.  The  workshop  identified  five  major  areas  of  support:  (i)  establish  a \nprocurement system; (ii) build capacity of PPMO; (iii) create a public procurement monitoring \nsystem; (iv) produce standard bidding documents for works, goods, consulting services, and \nother services; and (v) explore e-procurement. The Government requested ADB assistance for \ncapacity building of PPMO and knowledge sharing, so that an effective and efficient national \nprocurement  institution  could  be  developed.  Knowledge  transfer  for  public  procurement  is \ncrucial  for  the  Government  to  accelerate  development  efforts  and  improve  project \nimplementation. Strengthening PPMO through TA is envisaged to play a vital role. \n \n6.  The TA will be financed by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership \nFund, which aims to contribute to poverty reduction and economic and social development in \nADB\u2019s developing member countries. The major objectives of the fund are to (i) strengthen the \ncapacity of developing member countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals; (ii) \npromote information and communication technology; and (iii) bridge the digital divide, through \nnational and regional e-strategies. The TA concept paper was reviewed by the e-Asia and \nKnowledge  Partnership  Fund  review  committee, 4  and  submitted  for  funding  from  the \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea, Funding for the TA was approved on 11 April 2008.  \n \n7.    Improving transparency in public procurement proceedings, strengthening the capacity \nof  procuring  agencies,  and  institutional  development  of  anticorruption  institutions  are  an \noperational priority for instilling good governance that was identified as one of the three pillars of \nthe  2005\u20132009  country  strategy  and  program  for  Nepal. 5  The  TA  is  conceptually, \nprogrammatically,  and  procedurally  aligned  with  the  country  strategy  and  program.  It  will \naddress  the  policy,  institutional,  and  information  technology  aspects  of  procurement.  A \nstrengthened  PPMO  could  facilitate  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and  economic \ndevelopment targets through more efficient and effective public procurement.  \n \n8.    The World Bank supports the initiative to strengthen PPMO and will establish an e-\nprocurement  system.  It  is  also  processing  TA  for  preparing  a  procurement  business  plan, \ndeveloping  an  awareness  and  disseminating  strategy,  supporting  exposure  visits  to  other \ncountries,  and  conducting  procurement  training  at  regional  and  zonal  levels  for  core \nimplementation of the PPA and PPR. Both TA projects from the World Bank and ADB will \naddress the immediate needs of PPMO without any duplication in the areas of assistance.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA impact is to improve the efficiency and transparency in public procurement of \nworks,  goods,  and  services  to  promote  good  governance.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  is \nstrengthened procurement capacity of the Government. \n \n10.  The outputs of the TA are (i) publication of standard bidding documents and public works \ndirectives; (ii) monitoring and evaluation unit strengthened; (iii) procurement website established; \n(iv) training module developed; (v) norms for debarment developed; and (vi) e-procurement \nstrategy prepared.  \n \n                                                 \n4  The committee is chaired by the deputy director general of Regional and Sustainable Development Department \nwith representatives from the Central Operations Services Office, Central and West Asia Department, East Asia \nDepartment, Office of Information Systems and Technology, Pacific Department, and South Asia Department. \n5  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009): Nepal. Manila. \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented through extensive consultations with related stakeholders \nincluding government agencies, contractors, and consulting associations in Nepal. It will be \nimplemented in close coordination with the World Bank and other development partners so that \nthe Government\u2019s procurement system can be harmonized and strengthened. It will include the \nactivities summarized below. \n \n12.  Policy  Advice  and  Dialogue. A clear working policy with norms for  debarment of \nbidders,  consultants,  and  suppliers\u2014on  the  grounds  of  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  and \ncoercive bidding practices\u2014will be developed. The policy will also outline the guidelines for \ndebarment when contractual obligations are not complied with during contract implementation. \nThe norms will clearly spell out the debarment procedures to be followed by PPMO, from \nnotification of procuring entities to final enforcement of debarment.  \n       \n13.  Capacity  Building  and  Institutional  Development.  The  TA  will  (i)  strengthen  the \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  unit  of  PPMO  to  provide  proper  institutional  arrangements  for \nindependent  review  of  public  procurement  proceedings  and  to  give  advice  on  effective \nimplementation  of  the  PPA  and  PPR;  (ii)  develop  curriculum  and  training  modules  for \nprocurement  training;  and  (iii)  train  PPMO  staff  on  the  United  Nations  Commission  on \nInternational  Trade  Law  model  of  arbitration  and  International  Federation  of  Consulting \nEngineers conditions of contracts. \n \n14.    Publications. The TA will support (i) preparation of standard bidding documents for \nprocurement of works, goods, consulting, and other services in accordance with the PPA and \nPPR and standard forms for contracts and prequalification documents for mandatory use by all \nprocuring  agencies  at  all  levels;  and  (ii)  review  of  the  existing  public  works  directives, \ninstructions, technical notes, and manuals in line with the provisions of the PPA and PPR to \nensure  that  public  procurement  procedures  are  uniformly  and  transparently  applied  by  all \nprocurement practitioners. \n \n15.  Studies and Analytical Work. The TA will enhance the knowledge of PPMO staff on \nsuccessful implementation of modern procurement legislation and best practices of relevant \ncountries, including Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore through overseas study and \nobservation.  \n \n16.  Implementation of PPA and PPR. The TA will facilitate (i) full-fledged implementation \nof the PPA and PPR through operation of PPMO as an agent of reform during the entire TA \nperiod; and (ii) further reforms on procurement based on lessons from implementation of the \nPPA and PPR.  \n \n17.  Networking  and  Dissemination.  A  PPMO  website  will  be  established  to  provide \ninformation on public procurement as mandated by the PPA. An e-procurement strategy will be \ndeveloped  to  move  toward  full-fledged  e-procurement,  including  policy  and  legislative \nrecommendations. The information on public procurement procedures will be disseminated \nthrough seminars and workshops.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, of which the Government has requested \nADB  to  finance  $500,000.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  e-Asia  and \n ", "4   \nKnowledge Partnership Fund, to be administered by ADB. The Government will finance the \nremaining $100,000 equivalent to cover the costs of counterpart staff, office accommodation \nand utilities, and office equipment. The Government has been informed that the approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing program. The details of the cost estimates are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the Executing Agency. PPMO, under the Office of the Prime Minister and \nCouncil of Ministers, will be the Implementing Agency. A TA coordination unit will be established \nunder PPMO and will be headed by the TA director at the joint secretary (technical) level. The \nTA director will be responsible for day-to-day TA implementation and regularly report on the \nstatus of the TA to the secretary of PPMO as well as ADB. Two full-time PPMO staff with \nextensive knowledge on PPMO procurement will be assigned as the counterpart staff. The \nsecretary of PPMO will provide overall guidance to the TA coordination unit and review all the \nTA outputs.  \n \n20.  A steering committee will be formed, chaired by the secretary of PPMO.
