INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will identify, demonstrate, and \nevaluate  how  to  use  high-level  technologies  to  effectively  plan  high-quality  infrastructure \ninvestments, especially for transport infrastructure, and measure their economic impacts.1 The \nTA team will share and discuss lessons from the TA with developing member countries (DMCs) \nand Asian Development Bank (ADB) operations departments for planned or future ADB projects \nand government policies in developing Asia, including upper middle-income countries. \n \n2.  The proposed TA aligns with operational priority 2 of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, accelerating \nprogress in gender equality; operational priority 4, making cities more livable; operational priority \n5,  promoting  rural  development  and  food  security;  operational  priority  6,  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity; and operational priority 7, fostering regional cooperation \nand integration.2 In addition, it aligns with the Group of Twenty (G20) Principles for Quality \nInfrastructure investment, adopted at the 2019 G20 Osaka Summit.3 The TA is included in the \n2021 annual work program of ADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department \n(ERCD).4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Since the start of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, big data (including \nimages generated through satellite data) has proven useful in helping governments understand \nthe effectiveness of various COVID-19 control measures. For example, mobile phone data have \nbeen used to track the extent of people\u2019s movements in response to quarantines or other \nrestrictions on travel within and across cities. Expanded and deepened use of big data and \nsatellite images has stimulated the demand for big data analysis for other objectives, including \npublic agencies\u2019 management of infrastructure. Planning investments in infrastructure is complex, \nrequiring an understanding of how different types of investments interact with one another, \nexisting regulations and economic conditions, and the behavior of economic agents (e.g., firms \nand workers). Similarly, monitoring the quality of infrastructure is costly.  \n \n4.  Fortunately, recent advancement in high-level technology offers opportunities to better \nplan, construct, and maintain high-quality infrastructure.5 Spatial information, artificial intelligence, \nmachine learning, and the Internet of Things could be used for planning, designing, constructing, \nmaintaining, and monitoring high-quality infrastructure projects. For example, satellite imagery \nanalysis is a type of geo-coded big data that enables monitoring of the quality and usage of \ntransport infrastructure. Machine learning algorithms can be developed to extract features of high-\nresolution satellite imagery which correlate with available data on infrastructure quality, and \nsubsequently apply those algorithms to predict infrastructure quality outside of study areas. \nSimilarly, information from telecommunication companies can be used to infer how location and \ntravel decisions of economic agents respond to different types and qualities of infrastructure. \n \n \n1  The concept of high-quality infrastructure covers not only physical condition, functionality, and regulations on the use \nof infrastructure, but also climate and disaster resilience. Knowledge products to be prepared under the TA will reflect \ninsights on these topics, to the extent possible. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n3  G20. 2019. G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment. Annex Paper 1 to the G20 Osaka Leaders\u2019 \nDeclaration, G20 Summit. Osaka. 28\u201329 June. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 July 2020. \n5  In addition, big data and analysis could be used for selecting project proposals via optimization and contextualization. \nADB, Asian Development Blog. 2019. Can big data help us make better development decisions? \n ", "2 \n5.  DMC governments, however, have difficulty with identifying appropriate and feasible high-\nlevel technology options and have limited capacity to use them. Without proper planning, valuable \nopportunities could be missed. Big data generated from the high frequency data collection could \nremain idle, compromised, or even lost or intentionally deleted to reduce data storage costs.6 \nThus, there is a strong and urgent need to conduct pilot and case studies of effective use of high-\nlevel technologies to draw policy recommendations. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s support for infrastructure takes different forms and provides an excellent basis for \nchoosing an appropriate and useful set of pilot and case studies to consider. One example \nconcerns the provision of urban transport infrastructure. Because cities are the locus of structural \ntransformation and economic development\u2014i.e., where more productive and innovative firms, \nbetter-paying jobs, and key institutions and amenities are located\u2014developing Asia\u2019s ongoing \nurbanization process should be good news for the region\u2019s growth prospects. 7 However, Asia\u2019s \nexpanding cities, which account for a growing share of total population, will not automatically reap \nthe benefits of urban growth. Efficient provision and sound management of urban transport \ninfrastructure, alongside appropriate land use planning systems and other infrastructure, play a \nkey role in maximizing the benefits of urban agglomeration. As investments in urban infrastructure \ngrow in the region, it is necessary to understand how they help improve urban mobility and \namenities and thus contribute to economic growth. Studies on these issues are quite limited \n(largely because of weakness associated with traditional data sources), and capacity to efficiently \nregulate  and  manage  public  utilities  (such  as  water  supply  and  sewage,  energy, \ntelecommunication) remains weak in developing Asia. Rigorous research, made possible by \nemerging geo-coded big data, could help fill knowledge gaps and support informed policy making. \nTo create livable cities, city governments in the region could also learn from successful experience \nin managing and regulating utilities to deliver better service. \n \n7.  Another aspect of ADB\u2019s support for infrastructure is a regional approach, the first example \nbeing the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program, established with ADB support in 1992.8 \nThe GMS covers six countries along the Mekong River across 2.6 million square kilometers. Since \n1992, ADB provided more than $8 billion in financing to support priority GMS projects. A large \nshare of the GMS investment programs is concentrated on building roads, bridges, and other \ninfrastructure to forge mutually beneficial links and drive growth. Although some studies have tried \nto quantify the impacts of the GMS infrastructure investments for the region, the studies suffer \nfrom lack of reliable national and regional data and are of varying quality and coverage. Recent \ndevelopment in spatial information technology, such as satellite imagery analysis, provides an \nopportunity to measure the benefits across countries\u2019 borders, because such data  are not \nconstrained by national boundaries and provide granular and consistent information across all \nrelevant geographical units. \n \n \n6  Examples of high-frequency data include real-time night and daytime satellite imagery; container shipments, air \nfreight, and other granular flight data; mobile phone records and crowd-sourced internet data evaluated through \nartificial intelligence technologies; local carbon dioxide readings, wind speed, rainfall, and electric power absorption \nfrom national grid data; real time traffic data from roadway sensors and live operations centers; and consumer \ntransaction data. \n7  According to the United Nation\u2019s World Urbanization Prospects data, the number of urban inhabitants in developing \nAsia increased from 375 million to 1.8 billion between 1970 and 2017, accounting for 53% of the global increase in \nurban population. Current models suggest that from 2017 to 2050, the number of urban inhabitants is projected to \nincrease by almost 70% from 1.8 billion to 3 billion. This implies an increase in the urbanization rate from 46% to \n64% between 2017 and 2050. \n8  Subsequently, ADB started supporting the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program in 1997 and the \nSouth Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program in 2001. \n ", "3 \n8.  At the national level, ADB is increasing its support to rural road connectivity. For instance, \nADB\u2019s Integrated Road Investment Program, tranche 1, for Sri Lanka rolled out interventions in \nfive provinces and one rural district.9 The program\u2019s second, third, and fourth tranches were \napproved to cover rural road constructions in other remaining provinces. The program roads are \nscattered across large areas, and it is difficult to monitor the investment projects and evaluate the \nimpacts. The evaluation needs to identify hundreds of road sections and comparable road \nsections that are outside of the project. For the study, international experts propose the use of \ncall detail record of mobile phones, subject to data availability, to monitor traffic movements.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcomes \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Physical and financial sustainability of \ntransportation infrastructure in ADB DMCs improved.10 The TA will have the following outcomes: \nTransportation infrastructure monitoring and maintenance systems in ADB DMCs improved and \noperation and maintenance costs reduced.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Pre-feasibility study on the use of innovative technologies and data \nsources for enhanced monitoring of infrastructure quality conducted. The TA will use \nrepresentative data on transport infrastructure quality collected through innovative technologies \n(e.g., laser trackers on vehicles, accelerometers or gyroscopes installed on mobile phones, or \ncrowd-sourced internet data). It will fine-tune existing algorithms that have been pre-trained on \ntraditional satellite imagery or other types of innovative data and use transfer learning techniques \nso they can expedite the algorithm\u2019s learning rate to predict infrastructure quality in multiple \nsettings. Following recently developed techniques, the TA team and consultants will craft learning \nalgorithms to predict poverty and other development indicators to assess the impact of quality \ntransport infrastructure on communities. The TA team will arrange training programs for relevant \ngovernment agency officers on these algorithms.12 Overall, this component of the TA will serve \nas a pre-feasibility study that will provide inputs in developing a road map for capitalizing on \ninnovative technologies and data sources for infrastructure quality monitoring. The findings will \npotentially help DMC transport agencies to reduce monitoring costs and enable them to identify \nthe most effective preventive maintenance actions and contractual approaches. The TA team will \ncarry out in-depth consultations with relevant government agencies to discuss concrete steps to \nensure sustainability of this type of initiative. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Research  studies  and  capacity  building  on  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment and management in developing Asia conducted. The TA will conduct data \ncollection, economic research, and capacity building on issues related to urban infrastructure in \ndeveloping Asia, especially but not limited to transport infrastructure.13 Candidate projects include \n \n9  ADB. Sri Lanka: Integrated Road Investment Program, Tranche 1. \n10  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 A tentative list of target government agencies includes statistics offices and/or transport ministries of Cambodia, \nIndonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and/or Viet Nam. The list of DMCs will be finalized after data \nassessment and consultations with key stakeholders have been conducted. \n13 Candidate projects will cover DMCs from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet \nNam. \n ", "4 \n(i) conducting advance assessment of how roads, railways, ports, and/or airports in one selected \nAsian city will improve accessibility of residents and affect urban and economic structure in \ncatchment areas in the long term; (ii) examining what policies are necessary to complement urban \ntransport  infrastructure  in  one  or  two  selected  Asian  cities  to  maximize  the  benefits  of \ninfrastructure (e.g., land-use regulations); (iii) assessing urban congestion of selected Asian cities \n(10 or fewer) and how ongoing transport infrastructure projects improve urban mobility; (iv) \norganizing a conference on urban infrastructure development and management to promote \nresearch and knowledge sharing on urban infrastructure in developing world; and (v) helping build \nlocal government capacity in urban utility regulation and management and supporting research \non urban utility regulation such as tariff setting. All studies will require collecting or accessing \ninnovative, geo-coded big data. The capacity building should involve how to use big data to \nregulate or manage utilities. \n \n12.  Output 3: Case studies on impacts of high-quality infrastructure conducted and \ndisseminated.  The  TA  will  conduct  a few  case  studies  evaluating  the  impact  of  selected \ninfrastructure projects, including transport infrastructure investments in selected GMS countries \nand  ADB\u2019s  Integrated  Road  Investment  Program,  tranche  1  for  Sri  Lanka.14 These  cases \nrepresent  two  different  infrastructure  interventions:  a  region-wide  long-term  project  and  an \ninnovative  rural  road  project.15 These  evaluation  studies  will  adopt  high-level  information \ntechnologies, such as satellite imagery and other big data, and identify a wide range of economic \nand social impacts. Lessons will provide insights for other ADB projects and support peer-learning \nopportunities for ADB\u2019s members. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The following are ineligible items under the JFPR: (i) purchase of vehicles, (ii) salaries for \ncivil servants, (iii) foreign travel, (iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) detailed engineering \ndesign, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) those under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible \nItems (or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List.16 \n \nD.
