During  discussions  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  2012  on  its \nreengagement in Myanmar, the Government of Myanmar requested ADB assistance to improve \nits statistical capacity. ADB joined a multipartner mission to Myanmar 3\u20135 July 2012 to identify \nand prioritize the needs to build this capacity in Myanmar. The mission met with the then deputy \nminister and now minister of the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development \n(MNPED), as well as senior MNPED officials and representatives from 15 other ministries. The \nmeetings highlighted an urgent need for coordinated reforms to the national statistical system \n(NSS) and included government requests for support to develop capacity in many different parts \nof the statistical system. The areas where assistance was needed included training in statistics, \na comprehensive review of the NSS, development of a national strategy for the development of \nstatistics  (NSDS),  updating  an  outmoded  statistics  law,  establishment  of  a  high-level \ncoordination mechanism for statistics, and the filling of data gaps in the short-, medium-, and \nlong-term planning in various development sectors.  \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) is intended to meet some of the initial priority needs of \nMyanmar\u2019s NSS as part of what will necessarily be a long process to develop the country\u2019s \ncapacity to gather, organize, analyze, disseminate, and use statistics for its socioeconomic \ndevelopment. The project components were discussed with the Central Statistical Organization \n(CSO) and the Department of Planning of MNPED during a mission 24\u201325 January 2013 and \nthrough follow-up email correspondence. The government concurs with the impact, outcome, \noutputs, and key activities in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1.1 Under an \ninitiative by the Statistics Division of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific, Myanmar\u2019s development partners, including ADB and the World Bank, are \ncoordinating  their  support  for  building  capacity  in  the  country\u2019s  statistical  system.  The \ncoordination  between  development  partners  is  aimed  at  demarcating  areas  of  assistance, \ncomplementing activities to optimize assistance, and avoiding duplication of efforts. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  As  Myanmar  makes  a  political  and  economic  transition,  credible  and  timely  official \nstatistical information on social, economic, and environmental conditions will play a fundamental \nrole in effective policy making, planning, and monitoring for economic growth, poverty reduction, \nand attainment of such development targets as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nThe current NSS is decentralized, with the MNPED\u2019s CSO assigned a central role under the \nCentral Statistical Authority Act of 1952. Most government ministries and departments have \nsome statistical capacity to meet the data requirements in their sectors, but weak coordination \nbetween the CSO and ministries has led to severe systemic deficiencies. Adoption of the latest \ninternational statistical standards is lacking for the collection and compilation of statistics in \nmany areas. Statistical efforts are duplicated unnecessarily. Data gaps exist due to too few \nsurveys and censuses to periodically update key economic and social statistics. Data is lacking \non the growing private sector, and existing statistics are underutilized. The quality and credibility \nof the available statistics are an issue, and technical and institutional capacity is weak. Myanmar \nneeds  a  coherent  national  statistical  strategy  to  address  these  problems,  and  the  Central \nStatistical  Authority  Act,  which  does  not  provide  institutional  arrangements  for  effective \ncoordination of statistical activities across the NSS, needs to be revised and brought up to date.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 April 2013. \n ", "2  \n4.  Statistics on Myanmar\u2019s social and economic conditions and official data disseminated \nthrough the CSO website are limited, often old, and many are based on outdated statistical \nstandards. Often the quality of data is suspect and official statistics are not perceived to be \ncredible.2 Making quality statistics available is one of the four key objectives of Myanmar\u2019s five-\nyear National Development Plan for 2012\u20132016, which accords high importance to balanced, \ninclusive  growth.  Improving  statistics  in  the  country  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  interim  country \npartnership strategy, 2012\u20132014 for Myanmar under the theme of good governance. An ADB \nstudy has also identified building statistical capacity as a key to a successful transition in \nMyanmar. 3  \n \n5.  Myanmar also lags other Southeast Asian developing member countries in the statistical \nmonitoring of international development objectives such as the MDGs. A 2009\u20132010 MDG \nreport stated that Myanmar\u2019s MDG reporting \u201cdiffers from a standard MDG Report in that it relies \nexclusively on the Integrated Household Living Conditions Assessment II (IHLCA-II) survey data \nand only covers those MDGs which can be calculated on the basis of IHLCA-II data.\u201d4 As a \nmember of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Myanmar signed the 2001 \nASEAN Framework of Cooperation in Statistics, which committed members to support the \nregional planning and policy making of ASEAN bodies by providing comparable statistics in a \ntimely manner. ASEAN\u2019s aim to establish economic integration of the region by 2015 through \nthe ASEAN Economic Community heightens the need for the compilation and sharing of reliable \nstatistics by all of its members, including Myanmar.  \n \n6.  Establishment of an effective NSS in Myanmar to deliver relevant, credible, and timely \nstatistics is a prerequisite for successful developmental planning, as well as for efficient policy, \nprogram,  and  developmental  support  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  Reliable \nstatistics will also be needed to measure development effectiveness in the country as transition \nprogresses. The strategic and institutional capacity of the NSS of Myanmar and the statistical \nskills of staff need to be strengthened to enable Myanmar to adopt international standards in the \ncollection, compilation, and timely dissemination of comparable official statistics. The TA will \nprovide support to improve this statistical capacity, in line with the priorities of the National \nDevelopment Plan, ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy, and the regional cooperation \nneeds of ASEAN. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be a national statistical system that can adequately respond to the data \nneeds of development planning, policy making, and monitoring in Myanmar. The outcome will \nbe strengthened institutional, strategic, and technical capacity in the NSS.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will help the MNPED improve the strategic, institutional, and technical capacity \nof the NSS through five outputs, while collaborating with other development partners.  \n                                                 \n2 European  Union  External  Action  Service.  2007.

Providing  inputs  to  a  national  strategy  for  the  development  of  statistics. The \nproject will assess the institutional and legal framework of the NSS and Myanmar\u2019s national \naccounts statistics. These assessments will serve as inputs for preparation of an NSDS by the \ngovernment  in  collaboration  with  the  World  Bank  and  other  development  partners.  The \ncomprehensive assessments will offer recommendations that can be integrated into the strategy \nand implemented over the medium and long terms. \n \n10.  Strengthening  strategic,  institutional,  legal  and  organizational  frameworks.  An \nupdated statistics law will be drafted under the TA for wider consultation. The draft law will \nspecify improved institutional, organizational, and coordination mechanisms for the constituents \nof the NSS and lay out their roles and responsibilities. Based on the TA-supported assessments \nand recommendations, the TA will also provide technical support to develop appropriate legal \nand institutional frameworks for the NSS to adopt and implement.  \n \n11.  Training and skills development and building in-country training capacity. The TA \nwill design and implement needed in-country and international statistics training programs, with \nproportionate participation by female staff. The project will also improve the CSO\u2019s training \ncapacity by identifying training needs and helping it establish a training unit, training of trainers, \nand training programs to meet recurring basic statistical training needs in the MNPED and line \nministries. Computers and other training equipment will be provided on a limited basis to build \ntraining infrastructure. The TA will build statistical skills through short- and long-term training of \nstatistics staff in basic statistics and such specialized areas of statistics as economic statistics \n(e.g., national accounts statistics and price statistics); the design and implementation of large-\nscale surveys; and vital statistics and demography. Senior managers will be trained in statistics \nlaw  and  management  of  statistical  offices.  External  training  will  be  provided  mainly  by \ndeveloping  partnerships  with  specialized  regional  training  centers,  such  as  the  Statistical \nInstitute  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (SIAP)  in  Chiba,  Japan,  and  through  reputable  training \ninstitutions in developing countries with advanced statistical systems, such as India and the \nPhilippines.5 This will promote capacity building through South\u2013South cooperation.  \n \n12.  Improving  key  economic  statistics.  Compilation  of  economic  statistics  will  be \nupgraded through improved methods, classifications, and source data availability. Particular \nemphasis will be put on upgrading the national accounts statistics (NAS) to the System of \nNational Accounts (SNA) 2008 and improving price data.  This will follow a detailed assessment \nof the current status of these statistics, (particularly of NAS and price statistics), as well as of \nstatistical  classifications  such  as  standard  industrial  classification  and  classification  of \nconsumption expenditure.6 This review will identify methodological issues and the data and \nstatistical infrastructure constraints to producing NAS through a production and expenditure \napproach that complies with the 2008 SNA. These activities will help the MNPED to document \n                                                 \n5  SIAP is a subsidiary body of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. It contributes to \nsustainable socioeconomic development by promoting the understanding and advancement of official statistics \nthrough the training of professionals. The Government of Japan, as SIAP\u2019s host government, extends cooperation \nto the institute through its Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications by providing the bulk of financial \nresources, administrative and infrastructure support. The government also sponsors all SIAP\u2013JICA courses in the \nTokyo metropolitan area through JICA. Statistics training institutes such as the Statistical Research and Training \nCenter, Quezon City, Philippines; International Statistical Education Centre, Kolkata, India; and National Academy \nof Statistical Administration, Greater Noida, India could be explored for training if resources permit. \n6  Myanmar is one of the 23 participating economies in the International Comparison Program 2011 for which ADB is \nthe regional coordinating agency for Asia and the Pacific. The program is a global statistical partnership to collect \ncomparative price data, compile detailed expenditure values of the gross domestic products of participating \ncountries, and estimate purchasing power parities of the world\u2018s economies. \n ", "4  \nnational  accounts  data  sources  and  compilation  methods  and  to  use  standard  statistical \nclassifications. The TA will aim to strengthen the capacity of the staff in the MNPED and the \nagencies that provide input data for national accounts compilation and help them adopt the \n2008 SNA to the extent possible using the data available. It will develop and/or improve the \nmethodology for price indexes for the wholesale and/or producers\u2019 price index. The project will \nlay  particular  emphasis  on  learning-by-doing,  coaching,  and  mentoring  in  compiling  these \nstatistics.  By  doing  so,  it  will  build  synergy  and  avoid  any  overlap  with  ongoing  training \nassistance in national accounts statistics being provided by the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) and other development partners.7 \n \n13.  Improving  data  dissemination  and  use  of  statistics.  The  TA  will  support  the \nimprovement  of  statistics  publications  and  the  dissemination  of  official  statistics  with \ndisaggregation  by  sex  and  other  factors.  It  will  help  the  CSO,  which  is  the  main  data \ndisseminating agency, make data and metadata dissemination more timely through the print \npublication of reports, particularly the statistical yearbook, and through the CSO website and \nother  means  of  data  dissemination.  The  TA  will  help  develop  data  dissemination  policy \nguidelines and a data release calendar for key statistics, which will be important in making \nofficial statistics more accessible and up-to-date.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,450,000, of which $1,200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  and  administered  by  ADB.  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, office \nsupplies,  domestic  transportation,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented from June 2013 to August 2015. The MNPED will be the \nexecuting agency, and the CSO will be the implementing agency. A steering committee will be \nformed and will meet regularly to coordinate and monitor the TA activities. It will be chaired by \nthe deputy minister of the MNPED who is in charge of the CSO, and include senior officials from \nthe CSO, the Department of Planning, and other relevant agencies. ADB will coordinate with the \nline ministries and key development partners during implementation. An ADB TA focal point will \nprovide administrative support for the conduct of all activities. ADB will participate in steering \ncommittee meetings as an observer. \n \n16.  ADB will oversee the implementation of the TA. The TA will require an estimated 35 \nperson-months of international consultant services and 17 person-months of national consultant \nservices. The international services will comprise 8 person-months for statistical training and \ncapacity building support; 5 person-months for institutional, organizational, and statistics law-\nrelated reforms; 18 person-months to provide expertise on such topics as economic statistics, \nnational accounts, price statistics, sample surveys, and data processing; and 4 person-months \nfor in-country training on specialized statistical topics, as needed. The 17 person-months of \nnational consultant services will be used to help implement the TA, support the international \nconsultants,  and  assist  in  activities  related  to  the  statistics  law.  Training,  workshops,  and \n                                                 \n7The work on national accounts statistics will also be coordinated with other interested development partners, such as \nthe European Union and the International Monetary Fund, and with other work in related areas of economic \nstatistics that are relevant to the compilation of national accounts statistics, such as government finance statistics, \nbalance of payments, and price statistics.  \n ", "5 \nseminars  will  be  administered  by  the  consultants  from  the  TA  budget.  In  addition  to \nadministering the TA and conducting monitoring and review missions, ADB staff will also act as \nresource persons in workshops and training. \n \n17.  The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be \nengaged as individuals rather than through a firm due to the variety of specialized services \nrequired. They will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The TA funds will be disbursed to and liquidated by the MNPED in accordance with the \nprocedures and requirements of ADB\u2019s advance payment facility. The procurement of any \nequipment will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). Proper turnover of equipment will also be ensured at the project\u2019s completion \ndate. \n \n18.  Good practices and lessons will be disseminated through workshops, seminars, and all \nof  the  websites  of  the  project  participants  and  agencies,  including  those  of  ADB  and  the \ngovernment. ADB will coordinate with the Embassy of Japan and JICA counterparts regarding \nthe  workshops,  seminars,  and  press  releases  associated  with  the  project  and  keep  them \ninformed of project progress. Outcomes and lessons from the project will also be shared with \nthe Embassy of Japan and JICA. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,200,000  to  the \nGovernment of Myanmar to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Capacity Development of the National Statistical System, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \nImpact  By 2019    Assumption \nA national  The NSDS is being  Government  The government \nstatistical system  implemented.
