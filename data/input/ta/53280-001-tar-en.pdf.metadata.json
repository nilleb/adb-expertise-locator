INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will expand support of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to journalists in developing member countries (DMCs) to encourage \nhigh-quality journalism on a wide range of economic and social development issues in Asia and \nthe  Pacific.1 Capacity-building  programs  are  designed  to  deepen  participating  journalists\u2019 \nunderstanding of increasingly complex economic and social development issues, enabling their \nwork to support public discourse and promote informed policy dialogue on issues relating to the \nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The TA will deliver (i) a range of \ncapacity-building programs such as training, seminars, and participation in ADB annual meetings \nto develop journalists\u2019 technical skills and understanding of sector and thematic issues relevant \nto ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030; and (ii) a regional forum on media and development in Asia and the \nPacific. \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 is aligned with major global commitments such as the SDGs and the \nParis Agreement on climate change. It emphasizes ADB\u2019s role as a knowledge institution, \nincluding the sharing of practical solutions that fit local conditions, and of information and \nexperiences that enable countries to replicate good practices from across the region and beyond.2 \nIt also emphasizes the importance of tailoring the global development agenda to specific local \ncircumstances and calls for integrating expertise across sectors and themes to address more \ncomplex development challenges (footnote 2). This TA will improve the contribution of journalists \nto greater public awareness of development issues and solutions, to increase the likelihood of \ntheir  adoption.  This  TA  is  included  in  the  2019\u20132020  work  plan  of  ADB\u2019s  Department  of \nCommunications (DOC). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Development issues and challenges. Asia and the Pacific has made great strides in \npoverty reduction and economic growth since the late 1960s. However, the region has unfinished \ndevelopment agendas. Issues such as poverty and vulnerability, rising inequality, climate change, \ngrowing  environmental  pressures,  and  large  infrastructure  deficits  remain  to  be  addressed \n(footnote 2). Emerging trends such as technological advancements, urbanization, and changing \ndemographics present challenges. Also, as developing Asia becomes increasingly integrated with \nthe global economy and as its economic influence continues to grow, the need and demand for \nits perspectives and presence on global issues is rising. Given the size of Asia and the Pacific, \nachieving major global commitments such as the SDGs will depend critically on the success of \nthe region and its people. \n \n4.  Low awareness of development issues and challenges. Turning global commitments \nfrom aspirations into achievements will require the understanding and active participation of all \nsectors of society. Limited awareness and understanding prevent stakeholders from engaging \nand acting on the SDGs. To promote urgent action on development issues, it is imperative to raise \nawareness  and  knowledge  among  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders,  from  local  and  national \ngovernment officials to policymakers and regulators, to civil society organizations, businesses, \nand the public. \n \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 December 2019. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n ", "2 \n5.  Binding limitations and constraints faced by DMC journalists. The media, both \ntraditional and nontraditional, have a significant influence on public beliefs, attitudes, opinions, \nvalues, and behavior. They are one of the most influential means of transmitting knowledge and \ninformation to a broad public audience. This power can be used to raise awareness of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 priorities, including the SDGs, and promote positive actions.3 \n \n6.  DMC journalists are key actors in this effort because they can influence the understanding \nof millions of readers, listeners, and viewers daily. However, DMC journalists face limitations and \nconstraints.  Many  lack  the  resources  and  capacity  to  adequately  cover  a  wide  range  of \ndevelopment issues. They have few opportunities to study, report, and write about development \nissues. As the media landscape rapidly evolves and the complexity of development issues \ndeepens, many journalists lack the skills as well as exposure to relevant information, context, and \nnuances to make sound judgements and produce well-informed and balanced news stories. \n \n7.  In response, ADB has been conducting annual capacity-building programs for DMC \njournalists  since  2014,  in  conjunction  with  its  annual  meetings.4 Various  funding  sources \nsupported programs between 2015 and 2017.5 A small-scale regional TA: Capacity Building \nProgram for Journalists in Developing Member Countries, 2018\u20132019 supported programs in \n2018\u20132019.6 More than 70 journalists from 33 DMCs attended the TA-funded programs.7 \n \n8.  The programs provided unique opportunities for DMC journalists to learn about global \ndevelopment issues and interact with key actors from the development community in Asia and \nthe Pacific. Field visits and interactive open sessions with experts from ADB and its knowledge \npartners contributed to a deeper understanding of economic and social development issues and \nled to in-depth media coverage. Program participants reported a high level of learning directly \nrelevant to their work.8 Journalists produced significant coverage on issues such as sustainable \ndevelopment,  poverty,  economic  forecasts  and  economic  growth,  capital  markets,  energy, \ninfrastructure development, governance, regional cooperation, and gender, on top of country-\nspecific topics such as transport and disasters triggered by natural hazards.9 \n \n \n3  ADB sets seven operational priorities under its Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  (iv)  making  cities  more  livable;  (v)  promoting  rural \ndevelopment and food security; (vi) strengthening governance and institutional capacity; and (vii) fostering regional \ncooperation and integration. \n4  The DMC journalist program began at the ADB headquarters in September 2014, followed by ADB\u2019s sponsorship of \nselected DMC journalists to the 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 annual meetings using various funding sources. \n5  Funding sources were the former Department of External Relations\u2019 PR Outreach Budget (2015), Clean Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility (2016), and Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund and Urban Environmental \nInfrastructure Fund (2017). \n6  ADB. 2017.

Report on Follow-Up Initiative with Participants to ADB-Organized Capacity Building Programs for \nJournalists in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Manila. The report assessed knowledge gains and professional advancement \nof the journalists with sustained access to ADB and good relations with ADB. \n9  In the follow-up survey, journalists reported that they published 90 articles about ADB operations and broad \ndevelopment issues during and immediately after the 2015 annual meeting, 200 articles in 2016, and 290 articles in \n2017. DMC journalists invited in 2018 produced 170, those invited in 2019 produced 205 articles. \n \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: informed public debate in DMCs on economic \nand social development issues, including the SDGs, has been expanded. The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: DMC journalists\u2019 coverage of complex social and economic development \nissues has improved.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n10.  Output  1:  Journalists\u2019  capacity  to  report  on  complex  development  issues \nstrengthened. The TA will support a range of capacity-building programs, such as training, \nseminars, workshops, and participation in ADB annual meetings. The programs will (i) develop \nreporting, research, and analytical skills, and foster greater data literacy; (ii) expand exposure to \ndevelopment issues and experts; and (iii) improve understanding of issues related to Strategy \n2030\u2019s seven operational priorities. The programs will develop core content and include tailored \ninformation for national and subregional delivery to highlight locally relevant knowledge and \nexperience, including exposure to ADB projects as appropriate. The TA will design and implement \nthe programs in close collaboration with regional departments, resident missions, and sector and \nthematic groups. This output will result in a cadre of better-informed journalists across ADB DMCs, \ncontributing to higher-quality journalism and public dialogue on development issues. ADB will \npartner with the academe, think tanks, and other public and private sector communication \nprofessionals to bring the latest know-how to journalism. ADB will coordinate closely with the ADB \nInstitute in delivering selected capacity-building programs, as appropriate. \n \n11.  Output 2: Knowledge sharing and discussions on media and development issues \nenhanced. The TA will develop and hold a regional forum on media and development to \nencourage and enable knowledge sharing and experience exchange among journalists from \nDMCs, and interaction with leading journalists from global media outlets, selected knowledge \npartners, and senior ADB staff. The forum will facilitate discussion on the role of the media in \nsupporting informed debate on economic and social issues and contributing to the implementation \nof the SDGs. Forum materials will be captured and disseminated widely among the journalistic \nand development communities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund\u2014$525,000 (TASF 6) and $225,000 (TASF-other sources). \nThe key expenditure items are in the cost estimates and financing plan (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. DOC will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants and \norganize the training, seminars, workshops, and forums. ADB staff may serve as resource \npersons and provide administrative or secretarial support services. ADB will engage consultants \nand carry out procurement following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. \n \n \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \n14.  The TA will be implemented through an international consulting firm, an individual national \nconsultant, and resource persons. The consulting firm with expertise in designing and delivering \njournalism training on development issues will be recruited using quality-based selection. One \nindividual consultant will be hired to assist DOC with the delivery of the training, seminars, \nworkshops, and forums.11 \n \n15.  Following  approval  of  the  TA  and  mobilization  of  the  consultants,  DOC  will  hold \ndiscussions with operations and knowledge departments as well as with the ADB Institute to \ndetermine the detailed scope of the outputs and the implementation arrangements, including \nselection criteria and focus areas for the training, seminars, workshops, and forums. Participants \nwill be identified in coordination with resident missions and external relations officers.12 \n \n16.  The TA will also recruit resource persons and/or experts to support the training program \nand outreach activities. The TA will finance travel and per diem of ADB staff to act as resource \nspeakers. \n \n17.
