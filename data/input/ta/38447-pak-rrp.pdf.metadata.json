The environmental impact of the proposed Project \nAssessment  is expected to be insignificant.  \n   \nProject Description  The proposed technical assistance (TA) loan is designed to \nfacilitate  knowledge  and  information  acquisition,  and \ninstitutional  support  mechanisms,  with  the  overall  aim  of \nexpanding  employment  opportunities,  and  enhancing  the \ncompetitiveness  of  micro-  and  small  enterprises  (MSEs)  in \nrural areas on a sustainable basis. \n   \nRationale  Pakistan depends substantially on agriculture and other rural \nactivities to provide livelihoods for the majority of its population. \nFor Pakistan to meet its goal of reducing poverty by half by \n2015, and also to reduce rapid rural-urban migration, nonfarm \neconomic  opportunities  in  rural  areas  need  to  expand.  The \ncountry has around 150,000 small businesses and more than \nthree million microenterprises. The informal economy is largely \nunregulated and faces crucial resource constraints, particularly \nfinance,  skills,  new  technology  and  knowledge,  and \nmanagement.  Access  to  finance,  improved  technology,  and \npotential new markets and average standards of quality and \nproduct  uniformity  are  especially  low.  The  business \nenvironment  in  the  informal  sector  is  often  difficult  and \noccasionally  chaotic.  Since  more  than  90%  of  Pakistan\u2019s \nbusinesses  are  in  this  sector,  there  is  enormous  need  to \nincrease factor productivity. Despite some success, however, \nmany initiatives have been constrained by a variety of social, \ninstitutional, and political factors. What is required in view of \nthe problems mentioned is an innovative approach that works \noutside conventional institutions, and draws on lessons learned \nand  international  best  practices,  to  improve  the \ncompetitiveness of rural and peri-urban MSEs. \n   ", "iv \nImpact and Outcome  The designed impact of the TA loan is to create and diversify  \njob  and  income-earning  opportunities  in  the  rural  areas \nespecially for the landless, wage earners, and women. The \nintended outcome is to develop market facilitation processes \nby  identifying  and  filling  market  gaps  within  selected \nsubsectors in rural and peri-urban areas, and strengthening the \ncompetitiveness of the target groups. Steps will be taken to \ndesign innovative institutional arrangements and assess the \nfeasibility of establishing a not-for-profit company to catalyze \nbusiness development services and introduce best practices in \nenhancing social and environmental processes in support of \nthe growth of rural businesses. \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated project cost is $6.5 million equivalent, including \nphysical and price contingencies, duties and taxes, and interest \nand  service  charges  during  implementation.  The  foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $2.6 million, or 40% of the total \ncost.  The  local  currency  cost  is  estimated  at  $3.9  million \nequivalent, 60% of the total cost. Local currency costs include \nan estimated $155,000 equivalent in duties and taxes to be \npaid by the Government of Pakistan. \n   \nFinancing Plan                                                                                      ($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total   % \nExchange  Currency   \nADB  2.6  2.4  5.0  77 \nGovernment  0.0  1.5  1.5   23 \n   Total  2.6  3.9  6.5  100 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  3,505,000  ($5  million \nequivalent) will be provided from the Special Funds resources \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The loan will have a \n32-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an \ninterest rate of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% \nper year thereafter. \n   \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The period of the TA loan is 3 years. \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Executing Agency for the proposed Project will be the \nArrangements  Ministry of Industries, Production, and Special Initiatives, which \nwill be responsible for overall project facilitation management \nand  monitoring.  Pakistan\u2019s  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment  Authority  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency, \nresponsible for the facilitating work of the market development \npreparation  consultants  and  the  setting  up  of  the  proposed \nRural Enterprise Modernization Company. \n ", "  v\nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Industries, Production, and Special Initiatives \n   \nProcurement  The procurement of goods and services under the Project will \nbe according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles, \nequipment, and materials will be procured through international \ncompetitive bidding if they cost more than $500,000 equivalent, \nor  by  international  shopping  if  they  cost  from  $100,000  to \n$500,000 equivalent. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  are  required  for  technical  inputs  and \nproject management. A pool of consultants will be provided to \nsupport the TA components. The TA loan will provide flexibility \nin  recruiting  domestic  and  international  institutions  for  the \ndesign,  marketing,  and  technology  transfer  services,  and  in \nmeeting social and environmental safeguards. The TA loan will \nprovide  an  estimated  108  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  and  218  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services. All consultants will be engaged according \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The direct benefits will flow from increased employment and \nBeneficiaries  income-earning opportunities in the rural areas, particularly for \nwage  earners,  women,  and  poor  producer  groups  with  the \npotential to engage in a higher level of commercial activity. \nThese developments will be a consequence of addressing the \nmarket  gaps  and  failures  in  selected  subsectors,  and \nstrengthening the competitive position of the micro- and small \nbusinesses operating within those subsectors. It is expected \nthat  through  these  measures  there  will  be  increased  value \naddition in the products sold, improved commercial linkages \nbetween  rural  MSEs  and  the  larger  urban  businesses,  and \nincreased demand for goods and services.   \n   \n ", "vi \nRisks and Assumptions  The  project  design  makes  a  number  of  assumptions  with \n  associated risks. It is assumed that the Government remains \n  strongly committed to improving the market opportunities and \n  competitiveness of rural enterprises, especially those that now \n  lack  access  to  markets.  So  far  the  Government  has \n  demonstrated  strong  ownership  and  commitment  through  a \n  focus on addressing constraints in market access in the rural \n  areas. It is recognized that the project design will require a \n  knowledge-intensive  approach,  with  a  high  degree  of \n  responsiveness to emerging market opportunities. In addition, \nthere is a need to work with a number of institutions both within \nand outside the government. Extensive consultations with all \nstakeholders,  including  the  private  sector,  and  high-level \ngovernment support if not realized could delay the Project and \nlimit  understanding  and  development  of  the  appropriate \ninstitutional processes required to support the competitiveness \nof rural enterprises. This risk is addressed through the creation \nof  a  high-level  steering  committee  with  adequate \nrepresentation from the Government and the private sector. In \naddition,   the Project provides flexibility in engaging the private \nsector  and  other  stakeholders in all undertakings, and on-\ntime availability of a  range of  consultants  with   demonstrated \n  technical knowledge and international experience to analyze \nthe subsectors and design initiatives that respond to market \nopportunities  in  the  rural  areas.  The  need  to  stimulate \nimprovements  in  design  and  quality  and  to  ensure  social \ncompliance with labor laws, etc., among the rural enterprises is \naddressed  through  comprehensive  subsector  analysis, \nfollowed  by  carefully  designed  pilot  interventions  with \nappropriate  social  safeguards  and  processes  and  private \nsector linkages. The results of this subsector analysis and the \npilot interventions will in turn inform the business plan to be \nprepared for the establishment of an institution that will support \nthe  development  of  business  opportunities  for  rural \nentrepreneurs.  This  sequencing  of  implementation  gives \nadequate  focus  to  preparing  relevant  area-  and  product-\nspecific strategies for promoting business development, and \nminimizes the risk that the institution that is set up might fail to \nbe socially responsive, sustainable, and relevant to the needs \nof the underserved rural entrepreneurs.    \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Rural Enterprise \nModernization Project. The design and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  In South Asia as a whole, the nonfarm economy accounts for roughly 25% of rural \nemployment and 29% of rural incomes.1 Seasonal trading, agro-processing, manufacturing, and \nservice activities enhance rural livelihoods, support a growing agriculture, and supply consumer \ngoods and services. Nonfarm activity offers important economic opportunities for the rural poor in \nareas where landlessness is high. Pakistan\u2019s population is 68% rural and agriculture accounts for \nalmost 45% of total employment. Outside the agriculture sector, 46% of the rural poor (and 22% of \nthe rural population) are nonfarm households that do not share directly in incomes derived from \nagricultural crop production. Despite declining rural poverty in the 1970s and 1980s, poverty \nremained high in the 1990s. Real growth in agriculture declined to an average annual rate of 2.4% \nwith sharp year-to-year fluctuations from 1990 to 2002, compared with the overall rate of 3.5% \nachieved from 1960 onward. The yields of the major crops have largely stagnated in the past \ndecade. The percentage of the rural poor living below the poverty line was essentially unchanged \nbetween 1990 (36.9%) and 1999 (35.9%), and even rose to 38.9% in 2002, a drought year. If \nPakistan is to meet its goal of reducing poverty by half by 2015, rural economic opportunities must \nexpand in agriculture and the nonfarm sector. In the absence of a change in the structure of rural \nincomes and employment, growth in traditional crop agriculture and associated growth linkages \nmay not be adequate to substantially raise the incomes of the rural nonfarm poor households. \nStrategies to promote rural nonfarm income opportunities are therefore necessary to make an \nimpact on rural poverty in Pakistan.  \n \n3.  In many areas of rural development, Pakistan lags behind its Asian neighbors with fewer \nnatural resources. Drought and the poor performance of crops and livestock often force rural \npeople to migrate at least temporarily to the cities. This situation is exacerbated by the system \nof landholding, which is characterized by a high degree of land concentration by ownership and \nby a high incidence of sharecropping tenure in the two most populous provinces of Sindh and \nPunjab. Cities like Karachi with a population of around 14 million are increasingly ill-equipped to \nhandle the concomitant problems of overcrowding and pressure on the urban infrastructure and \nenvironment. The urban population grew from 24 million in 1981 to 53 million in 2005. Hence, \nthere is a pressing need (also found in other Asian countries) to seek nontraditional work \nopportunities in rural areas. Efforts must therefore be made to diversify the rural economy in \nnonfarm sectors such as services, small-scale manufacturing, and value-added agricultural \nprocessing. The proposed TA loan targets rural and peri-urban enterprises that have potential \nfor labor-intensive growth if provided with synergistic support by a range of private sector, \nnongovernment, and public sector partners. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  International Food Policy Research Institute. 2002. Strategies for Stimulating Poverty-alleviating Growth in the \nRural Nonfarm Economy in Developing Countries. Washington, D.C. (July). ", "2 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Problems Faced by Rural Enterprises \n \n4.  Pakistan  has  around  150,000  small  businesses  and  more  than  3  million \nmicroenterprises, which together compose more than 90% of the country\u2019s total businesses. \nMany of the micro- and small enterprises (MSEs) are in rural areas and depend heavily on \nagricultural raw materials and poorly skilled nonfarm labor. Rural businesses face difficulty in \naccessing a range of essential financial and business development services (BDS).2 Access to \nfinance and improved technology and average standards of quality and product uniformity are \nespecially low. More importantly, challenges are posed by (i) the generally low level of literacy, \nparticularly among women; (ii) poor business management practices; and (iii) reluctance or \nlimited  capacity  to  adopt  more  modern  technology  and  practices,  and  to  take  on  new \ncommercial  risks.  Entrenched  linguistic  and  ethnic  differences  provide  further  obstacles  to \ninvestment in nonfarm activities that cross provincial or tribal boundaries. \n \n5.  The MSE business environment is influenced, by, among others, infrastructure, social \nrelationships,  energy  costs  and  reliability,  and  increasing  competition  from  modern  urban \nbusinesses and imports, which pose tough challenges in niche and mass markets. These \nfactors translate into underdeveloped rural nonfarm enterprises and cottage industries, and loss \nof opportunities for employment growth and added market value. The status of selected rural \nindustries is presented in Appendix 2. \n \n  2.  Policy Initiatives and Rural Finance Programs in Pakistan  \n \n6.  Private businesses, including MSEs and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), are the \nprimary  target  groups  of  the  Government\u2019s  program  to  promote  growth  through  economic \ndiversification. This is reflected in the Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Framework, \nwhich aims, among others, to facilitate the development of human capital and the private sector \nas engines of economic growth. Finalized in July 2005, the framework recognizes the need to \nincrease  factor  productivity  through  technology-led  human  resource  development  that  builds \ncapacity for innovation and leverages local knowledge. This vision will require a combined effort to \nadd to the human resource base via a range of interventions, including bringing more women into \nthe labor force, increasing skill levels, and combining these skills with better infrastructure and \ntechnology. With this broad strategy in mind, Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Country Strategy \nand  Program  (2006\u20132008)  notes  ADB\u2019s  role  in  promoting  the  private  sector  as  a  driver  of \ninvestment, growth, and employment generation. The proposed TA loan is the third innovative \nADB effort to support the Government\u2019s objective of private sector\u2013led enterprise development.3 \n \n7.  Formal  financial  sector  lending  to  rural  MSEs/SMEs  is  very  low,  but  this  is  being \naddressed by the Government and is expected to improve gradually. Data relating specifically to \nrural MSEs are limited, but in the SME sector only about 5% of some 50,000 enterprises with \n                                                 \n2  BDS encompass a range of services that enhance market access, technology and product development, quality \nstandards, accounting, and information and communication technology. \n3  The others are the Small and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program (SMESDP), approved in December \n2003, and the Agribusiness Development Project (ADP), approved in May 2005. SMESDP will enhance the \neffectiveness and outreach of the SME Development Authority (SMEDA), established in the late 1990s to assist \nsmall businesses. The focus of SMEDA is mainly urban and on enterprises larger in size than the MSEs targeted \nunder this TA loan. SMESDP will improve the access of SMEs to BDS via a Business Support Fund, and assist in \nrationalizing small business financing through the SME Bank. ADP is intended to remove constraints in the value \nchain and improve grading and standards, seed testing and certification, and market information. ADP provides \ntraining and support for innovation through the Agribusiness Support Fund, with a primary focus on horticulture and \nlivestock, which show potential for value addition through small commercial enterprises. \n ", "  3\nless than five employees receive funding from formal financial institutions. Commercial banks \nand mainstream financial institutions remain focused on corporate urban clients, and only very \nlately have some financial institutions begun to explore small businesses as an attractive niche, \nalthough  the  focus  remains  on  urban  areas.  The  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (SMESDP)  and  the  Agribusiness  Development  Project  (ADP),  both \nfunded by ADB, provide support to commercial banks and rural finance institutions to enhance \ntheir outreach to SMEs. These efforts focus on (i) improving SME creditworthiness; (ii) reducing \nthe perceived level of risk faced by financial institutions in lending to SMEs; and (iii) enhancing \nthe capacity of financial institutions to identify new lending opportunities, and to appraise and \nsupervise SME loans. \n \n8.  Serious impetus for developing microfinance\u2014which presents the main medium-term \noption for many MSEs to access financial services\u2014came in the late 1990s as the sector came \nto be regarded as an important strategic instrument for addressing rising poverty in Pakistan. \nComprehensive policy regulations, including the Microfinance Ordinance 2002, were formulated. \nThe credit and savings program of the Aga Khan Rural Support Program (AKRSP) evolved into \nthe First Microfinance Bank, and led to the subsequent establishment of the Khushali Bank \nunder  the  ADB-financed  Microfinance  Sector  Development  Program.4 With  an  increase  in \nborrowers from 100,000 in 1999 to more than 400,000 in 2004, and a gross loan portfolio of \nPRs4.5 billion, the microfinance sector has grown rapidly in recent years. Although less than 6% \nof the market is now being served, it is projected that by 2009 the number of active borrowers \nwill rise to 2.9 million.5 \n \n3.  Small Nonfarm Enterprise Development in Rural Asia \n \n9.  In Asia as a whole, rural nonfarm growth has been fastest in countries having a dynamic \nagriculture, rapid urban-industrial growth, requisite managerial and labor skills, ready markets \nfor inputs (including financing) and outputs, and good basic infrastructure (roads, power, and \ncommunications). A central feature of Asia\u2019s rural nonfarm growth is that it has been led almost \nentirely by the market and the private sector. Public sector efforts to directly organize rural \nindustry and business have generally not succeeded on a broad scale. \n \n10.  Besides ADB and AKRSP, support for private enterprise development in Pakistan has \nbeen provided by the World Bank, bilateral donors including the Swiss Agency for Development \nand Cooperation, and a range of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) (Appendix 3). More \nbroadly, rural MSE/SME efforts in the Asian region have included both public and private sector \n(profit oriented) initiatives. In 1998\u20132000, the Committee of Donor Agencies for Small Enterprise \nDevelopment\u2014in  which  ADB  participated\u2014organized  a  series  of  international  and  regional \nconferences that led to an emerging consensus on principles for donor interventions in BDS.6 The \nBDS market development paradigm is based on the principle that achieving economic and social \ngoals is possible only by relying on private sector actors to provide a diverse array of services. \nRelying  on  the  private  sector  requires  understanding  how  BDS  providers  can  be  financially \nself-sustaining. The design of the TA loan reflects the experience gained in the major rural \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIslamic Repubic of Pakistan for the Microfinance Sector Development Program. Manila \n5  Microfinance in Pakistan: Innovating and Mainstreaming, an international conference in December 2004. \n6  The Committee of Donor Agencies for Small Enterprise Development was established in October 1979 at a \nmeeting convened in Berlin at the invitation of the World Bank. Bilateral and multilateral donor organizations \nengaged in the development of small-scale enterprises in developing countries were represented. The participants \nagreed that supporting small enterprise development was a rapidly growing area of interest and that closer \ncontacts among organizations would help harmonize approaches and prevent confusion arising from differing \ninterventions.   \n ", "4 \nbusiness  promotion  initiatives  and  different  approaches  to  job  creation  and  employment \ngeneration in Pakistan, including AKRSP, and programs supported by other donors and NGOs. \nThe lessons also draw on the wider international experience and emerging best practices in small \nbusiness development (Appendix 4). \n \na.  Mechanisms for Program Delivery/Institutional Models \n \n11.  The following section provides a summary of program delivery mechanisms for providing \nbusiness development services to MSEs/SMEs. \n \n(i)  Under SMESDP, ADB has actively engaged the Small and Medium Enterprise \nDevelopment Authority (SMEDA) in reorienting its BDS approach. As a result, \nSMEDA has started to move away from direct intervention in SME training and \npreparation of business plans to a more facilitative role. Additional impetus to \nthese efforts will come from the Business Support Fund (BSF), which upon its \nestablishment will improve market-based SME access to BDS. Despite adequate \nplanning and consultations during the preparation of SMESDP, the establishment \nof  BSF  has  taken  more  time  than  expected.  From  experience,  innovative \ninitiatives  involving  a  new  and  diverse  set  of  stakeholders  require  adequate \nplanning and support for public sector consensus building to ensure that the \ninitiative can take off. \n(i)  Public  funds  should  be  used  for  developing  markets  rather  than  individual \nbusinesses, so that more target commercial stakeholders can benefit. Publicly \nfunded programs should therefore focus on market growth and address market \ngaps and failures to the advantage of the target business groups. The programs \nshould not directly deliver services to small enterprises, since that would be cost-\nineffective and would limit outreach, would not be sustainable in the long run, and \nwould lead to supply-led rather than demand-driven services. \n(ii)  Direct interactions between publicly funded programs and small businesses are \nbased on an unequal relationship if the latter cannot hold the former accountable \nfor the quality and range of the services provided. These interactions should be \nmutually accountable, businesslike, and transaction-based. \n(iii)  Businesses should be established in the private sector by entrepreneurs taking \nthe  lead,  not  publicly  funded  organizations,  since  the  latter  would  displace \ncompetition and private sector initiative. More importantly, the financial discipline \nand vigilance that comes with investing equity or taking recourse to debt augurs \nwell for the profitability of a business and the careful calculation of risks that the \nentrepreneur must make. \n(iv)  Businesses  established  with  cost-free  donor  money  and  housed  in  social \ndevelopment organizations are undermined by inherent conflicts between the \nsocial  development  goals  of  the  organization  and  the  profit  motive  and \ncommercial competitiveness of the business. \n \nb.  Focus of Interventions \n \n12.  A suggested menu of approaches to target focused interventions for MSE development \non a competitive basis are listed in the following section. \n \n(i)  MSE development must be considered in the context of the commercial and \nsocial  milieu,  not  in  isolation  from  it.  Otherwise,  efforts  will  not  address  the \nfundamental constraints of disconnection from demand, innovation, knowledge, \ntechnology, competition, and efficiencies present in the formal sector. The latter \n ", "  5\nis  an  invaluable  repository  of  technical  and  managerial  skills  for  small \nbusinesses, which can in turn enable large businesses to minimize overhead \ncosts through outsourcing.  \n(ii)  Programmatic interventions of publicly funded development programs should be \ntime-bound, i.e., designed with exit strategies in mind so that the sustainability of \nimpact is considered right from the start of the intervention. \n(iii)  The  problem  for  small  businesses  is  not  just  marketing  and  design,  but \nunderstanding  whether  producing  what  consumers  want  is  financially  and \ntechnically feasible. Frequently, too many resources are spent trying to market \nexisting products, rather than understanding what different consumer segments \nwant, and whether the target business groups have the potential capacity to meet \nthose demands. \n(iv)  Export  markets  are  very  competitive  and  difficult  to  tap.  The  required \nstandardization, high volume, and quality at competitive prices are not easily \naccomplished by rural enterprises. \n(v)  Product innovation initiatives should be (a) based on holistic market research \nabout what will be required at the production, marketing, sales, and management \nlevels; and (b) guided by whether it is within the existing or potential capacity of the \ntarget business groups to compete profitably. All of these should be driven by the \nkinds of products different consumers want. \n(vi)  Direct subsidies should be avoided. Where deemed necessary, they must have \nclear objectives, be time-bound, with terms and expectations clearly understood by \nthe recipients. Otherwise, it is difficult to wean businesses away from free services, \ndependency is created, and the commercial market for BDS is distorted. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The overall objective of the TA loan is to create and diversify job and income-earning \nopportunities in the Project area, particularly for the landless, wage earners, and women. The \npurpose is to develop market facilitation processes by identifying and strengthening market gaps \nwithin selected subsectors Project area, and enhance the competitiveness of the target groups by \nfacilitating access to a range of BDS, including appropriate technologies and financial capital. The \nTA loan  will  help  analyze  opportunities  in  designing  innovative institutional arrangements and \nassess the feasibility of establishing a not-for-profit company that would serve as a focal point for \ninitiatives to support the development and growth of rural businesses. Initiatives under the TA loan \nwill be aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of small businesses by enabling them to improve \nthe  quality,  standardization,  volume,  and  value  addition  of  their  products,  and  to  serve  more \neffectively a larger consumer base and niche markets. Rural enterprise modernization will also entail \nincreasing awareness among MSEs about BDS and related social and environmental safeguards, \nand  identifying  and  enabling  access  by  rural  businesses  to  a  range  of  appropriate  BDS, \ntechnologies, and financing, all customized to match rural MSE absorptive capacity and business \npotential. The TA loan embodies a three-pronged strategy: (i) identify key opportunities for local, \nnonfarm rural growth; (ii) focus on subsector-specific supply chains and constraints on expansion; \nand (iii) build diverse, flexible coalitions among partners that have interest in achieving results. \n \nB.  Outputs \n14.  The TA loan will (i) fill major gaps in information and analysis on rural nonfarm MSEs \nand consolidate this information in a knowledge management system; (ii) identify and initiate \n ", "6 \ncarefully  targeted  pilot  interventions  to  support  rural  MSE  development;  and  (iii)  assess \ninstitutional support processes and the feasibility of establishing an autonomous, not-for-profit \nentity  to  facilitate  rural  MSE  development.  The  TA  loan  has  three  components:  (i)  market \ndevelopment preparation (MDP), (ii) sector analysis and pilot interventions, and (iii) preparatory \nanalysis for the design of a Rural Enterprise Modernization Company (REMC).7 \n \n1.  Market Development Preparation \n15.  The TA team to be recruited for the MDP facility will analyze the outreach and resources \nrequired to build the business skills of small rural enterprises. MDP will involve preparatory work \nby  international  and  local  experts  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  market-driven \ndevelopment program. They will identify areas for further research, initiate the collection of \nrequired data, and, finally, design pilot projects in selected subsectors. It is expected that the \nwork under MDP will, within 18 months of the TA loan\u2019s inception, lead to a feasibility study on \nthe establishment of the REMC and other alternatives that might be more appropriate to the \nactivities of a special vehicle for strengthening the competitiveness and responsiveness of \nnonfarm rural businesses to local and international markets. After this assessment of the need \nfor a vehicle such as REMC, and ADB\u2019s approval of such a need, the MDP team will prepare \nthe feasibility study for the design of the organizational and operational framework of REMC \n(outreach strategy, structure, initial business plan, standard operating procedures, and social \nand environmental compliance processes). SMEDA will house the MDP team within the rural \nenterprise modernization cell8 and, under guidance of a steering committee, assist in recruiting \na team of local and international consultants to do the work. SMEDA will also provide logistical \nand administrative support to the MDP team.9 \n \n16.  The MDP team will develop strong linkages with business associations, concerned donors \nand donor-financed projects, commercial banks, microfinance institutions and NGOs supporting \nMSEs. In addition, the experience gained through the Agribusiness Support Fund and BSF will be \nthoroughly analyzed. These linkages with ongoing initiatives will allow mutual learning, avoid \nduplication of effort, leverage limited resources, draw on the experience and strengths of partner \norganizations, and catalyze policy advocacy on behalf of rural enterprises. Linkages will also be \nestablished with rural enterprise development and BDS programs across Asia. The Project will \nhold workshops and training for a range of stakeholders. \n \n2.  Sector Analysis and Pilot Interventions \n \n    a.   Sector Analysis \n \n17.  The MDP team will review secondary sources of data and studies on rural nonfarm \nenterprises, identify key gaps in knowledge, and commission or conduct additional research to \ndevelop a more complete and purposeful information (data) base on the rural nonfarm economy \nthat can inform the design of the rural enterprise development agenda.10 \n \n                                                 \n7  The name of the company is preliminary and may be changed to a more suitable local name at the time the \ncompany is established. \n8  Also known as Aik Hunar Aik Nagar.  \n9  SMEDA  has  done  considerable  research  on  SME  development  in  a  range  of  subsectors  and  has  gained \nconsiderable knowledge about small-scale industrial growth. However, SMEDA provides services mainly to urban \nSMEs, and also lacks a significant outreach capability. \n10  Supplementary Appendixes A and B give further details on the process to be followed in the sector analysis and in \nthe integration of information and communication technology in the various components of the Project. \n ", "  7\n18.  The MDP team will prepare a database with information on the geographic and product \nmix  of  rural  and  peri-urban  small  enterprises  and  occupational  groups  in  Pakistan.  Such \ninformation is scarce at present.11 The database will systematically identify where and how (by \nscale, employment, and other enterprise characteristics) product subsectors tend to \u201ccluster.\u201d12 \nThis information will enable the selection of subsectors and geographic clusters, and, in turn, \nthe  selection  of  specific  businesses  to  work  with  within  a  subsector.  The  result  will  be  a \ncomprehensive analytical database on the rural nonfarm economy that would be a \u201cone-stop \nshop\u201d for rural development workers. Subsector analyses will be carried out in approximately \ntwo to four subsectors. For ease of management, clusters within a subsector should be in close \ngeographic proximity and the subsectors should preferably be related.  \n \n19.  The TA team will determine the subsector selection criteria in conjunction with other \nstakeholders. These criteria are likely to include (i) size of the sector (number of MSEs13 and \npeople employed); (ii) growth potential (local and national demand and export prospects); and \n(iii) target group priority, i.e., women, minority group, unemployed youth, or geographic location. \nFor the pilot projects, at least two subsectors that have a predominance of women wage \nworkers  or  entrepreneurs,  and  that  demonstrate  the  growth  and  market  potential  of  the \nsubsector if assisted, will be chosen. The BDS needs of target businesses will be assessed to \nallow  the  Project  to  develop  and  strengthen  private  sector  BDS  providers  that  are \norganizationally akin to and geographically within the reach of the target business groups. MDP \nresearch will focus on the supply, demand, and transaction issues related to promoting private \ncommercial BDS services. \n \n20.  The MDP team will prepare subsector and cluster development plans to document \nopportunities and constraints in the selected subsectors. These plans will be prepared with the \nactive participation of all stakeholders, including MSEs operating in the subsectors/clusters, \nBDS providers, and other civil society organizations. The plans will clearly define development \ngoals, expectations, and the roles and contributions of the different stakeholders; the time frame \nfor completion; the exit strategy from the subsector once all the relevant links for better product \nmarketing, design, and promotion have been made; risks and mitigation strategies; resource \nneeds; and monitoring and evaluation indicators.  \n \nb.  Pilot Projects \n \n21.  Following the MDP-led subsector studies identifying the opportunities and constraints, \npilot projects, including two pilot projects with a predominance of women wage workers or \nentrepreneurs, will be undertaken to gain experience and develop a framework for the outreach \nand partnership arrangements with stakeholders, including the private sector. Through a series \nof  interactive  and  participatory  workshops,  a  priority  list  of  potential  pilot  projects  will  be \nidentified within the clusters/subsectors analyzed. The selection criteria for these pilot projects \n                                                 \n11 The last national survey of small and household manufacturing industries was conducted in 1996\u20131997. Relevant \nsources of research material are available from other small business support projects, such as SMEDA, the Punjab \nand Sindh Small Industries Cooperatives, and donor initiatives. \n12  It is widely observed that specific crafts and small-scale industries tend to be regionally concentrated in Pakistan \n(e.g., hand-stitched soccer balls and other sports goods in Punjab, handwoven textiles in Punjab and Sindh,  and \nhandicrafts in the North-West Frontier Province), but the opportunities for value addition in such clusters need to be \nsystematically analyzed.  \n13 The definition of the MSE target group also needs to be determined. SMEDA sets an eligibility ceiling of PRs20 \nmillion in assets and 20 employees for trading SMEs, but does not specify lower limits. The definition of MSE \nunder the TA loan will probably be flexible, varying by region, given the differences among the rural areas and \nenterprises. It is also to be noted that the term \u201csmall\u201d has never been explicitly defined by the Committee of Donor \nAgencies for Small Enterprise Development. The committee considers this term to include formal and informal \nnon-agricultural enterprises ranging from micro to medium size. \n ", "8 \nwill be decided by stakeholders, who will be guided in their choices by the appraisal unit \nestablished within the MDP to facilitate these processes. The main considerations in selecting \npilot projects will be the extent to which clearly identified market transactions can be assessed \nand interest solicited for products and services from potential buyers or other outsourcing \nopportunities, as an indication of market demand for the products of the pilot projects. Proposals \nfor pilot projects should include a built-in monitoring and evaluation process. Interventions within \nthe pilot projects should have a significant impact on the business performance of selected \nsmall enterprises owned or managed by the target groups, leading to sustainable improvements \nin their livelihoods from nonfarm enterprises and activities.  \n \n22.  The precise nature of these pilot projects will be determined in the implementation \nphase. The TA team will need to start with an in-depth analysis of selected subsectors. Some \nillustrative examples highlight the potential and opportunities. Outsourcing is increasingly being \nrecognized as an effective business development strategy. About 10,000 urban workers and \n30,000 rural workers in the 1,450 villages around Sialkot are involved in the production of \nsoccer balls alone. Over time, these clusters producing hand-stitched soccer balls have evolved \npartnerships with leading designers and distributors of sports products and equipment. With \ninternational focus on consumer labeling, opportunities have been created for improved working \nconditions and enhanced wages at market rates for workers in designated work centers, and \nsupport for vocational training for children who were previously associated with soccer ball \nmanufacturing. Opportunities in rural and peri-urban areas in Pakistan continue to emerge, and \nover time there has been an increased focus on competitiveness, skills development, and \nresponsiveness to emerging market demand.  \n \n23.  Ceramics is another area where there is considerable potential and major production is \nconcentrated in clusters operating in the provinces of Pakistan. Private sector partnerships \ncombined with business development facilitation provides a potential opportunity to facilitate \nmarket linkages for producers who are currently unorganized, know little about sophisticated \nproduction processes, and are not aware of the contemporary market requirements. Cluster-\nspecific interventions could support access to advanced technology and improved awareness of \nenvironment and labor standards in selected locations for a range of hand-designed products \nmade of ceramic tiles. Linked with this is the need to identify industries/areas with high potential \nfor attracting investments into the rural areas. This analysis should aim to identify concomitant \nneeds for local infrastructure development that the public sector must consider to realize the \nidentified business promotion potential.14 \n \n24.  The expanding fashion industry has established links with rural communities, especially \nwomen in contracting out various activities including raw material supply and fabric stitching. But \nunreliability  of  supply,  constraints  in  traditional  technology,  and  low  labor  returns  currently \nhamper the access of the rural poor to emerging market opportunities. While the private sector, \nincluding some of the large buying houses, remains keen to access these skills, there is no \norganized platform available to link these producers with emerging market opportunities. By \ntapping specialist skills in Pakistan or elsewhere in Asia, a pilot project might work in a selected \nproducer cluster to (i) organize the producers and facilitate the existing processes from design \nto delivery; (ii) assess the interest of local producers in responding to market demand and \nimproving product quality and market awareness, and the interest of hand-loom merchants in \nimproving  marketing  know-how;  (iii)  support  training;  and  (iv)  facilitate  the  access  of \nproducers/merchants to suitable financing, market linkages, and BDS. The TA team will conduct \n                                                 \n14  Supplementary Appendix C further illustrates possible pilot projects and the associated monitoring framework. \n ", "  9\nawareness-raising  campaigns  among  rural  businesses  to  encourage  socially  responsible \npractices and social protection measures. \n \n25.  The  TA  loan  will  be  an  MSE  facilitator,  but  must  avoid  distorting  the  market  and \nweakening private sector initiative. The goals are to rectify knowledge and information gaps, \nand  to  build  rural  MSE  capacity  to  develop  competitively.  Therefore,  in  designing  specific \ninterventions,  a  guiding  principle  is  to  avoid  inculcating  beneficiary  dependency  and \nunsustainable business momentum through subsidized services. Instead, the efforts will support \nbusinesses by following a businesslike, transaction-based approach from the start of operations. \nThere must be a clear exit strategy from a given subsector, which should also be communicated \nto all participants. This approach is essential to ensuring sustainable impact. \n \n26.  Some circumstances may justify subsidizing services directly, e.g., where there would be \na substantial demonstration effect on businesses that are too risk-averse to invest in new \ntechnology or services, or reluctant to explore new markets. In these instances, the goals of the \nsubsidized services will be clear, explicitly agreed upon between recipient businesses and the \nMDP team, time-bound (preferably on a declining basis), and will provide incentives for good \nperformers. Any case for subsidy will have to be approved by the appraisal unit after going \nthrough a rigorous test to demonstrate its value and indispensability.15  \n \n3.  Rural Enterprise Modernization Company \n \n27.  International experience indicates that opportunities in rural competitiveness can be \nstimulated by access to a range of BDS services. These services facilitate acquisition of skills, \nknow-how, expertise, and market understanding by the rural MSEs. The Pakistani market is \ncharacterized by a generally low usage of BDS in the rural areas, which adversely affects the \nsector\u2019s competitiveness and its potential contribution to the economy of Pakistan. To fill this \nvacuum in the rural areas, there is a strong rationale for supporting institutional processes that \ncan  strengthen  private  business  competitiveness  in  rural  areas  to  achieve  growth  in \nemployment  and  income,  particularly  among  enterprising  low-income  and  disadvantaged \nindividuals and groups. Given the information gaps confronting rural markets in the nonfarm \nsector,  preparatory  work  is  designed  to  better  understand  market  opportunities  for  the \nunderserved MSEs. Work carried out to identify potential subsectors, consolidate required data, \nand  draw  up  the  framework  for  the  pilot  projects  will  provide  the  basis  for  analyzing  the \ninstitutional processes required to stimulate competitive business development opportunities in \nthe rural areas and to establish the proposed REMC.  \n \n28.  The MDP team will also analyze alternative institutional support processes to document \noptions available to the Government to strengthen private business competitiveness in rural \nareas to achieve sustained growth of employment and incomes. It is expected that within 18 \nmonths of the TA loan\u2019s inception, ADB in consultation with the Government will make a \ndecision  on  the  establishment  of  the  REMC,  in  case  its  feasibility  is  established  and  the \nbusiness plan for REMC is approved. \n \n29.  Once the decision is made to establish the REMC, the MDP team will define a cost-\neffective management structure and a strategy to ensure outreach in dispersed rural areas. \nFinancial projections to be prepared in support of the feasibility study on the proposed REMC \nwill  analyze  the  fiscal  implications  of  its  establishment.  Strategies  will  be  prepared  to \n                                                 \n15  SMESDP and ADP offer subsidies in the form of matching grants (under the Business Support Fund and the \nAgribusiness Support Fund, respectively) to target enterprises and groups. Although not considered at this \nformative stage of REMC, such an approach may be revisited once REMC is well established and more is known \nabout the effectiveness of these funds under SMESDP/ADP. \n ", "10 \ndemonstrate how sustainability and service cost-effectiveness issues will be addressed over \ntime. The expected management structure of REMC will be developed during the TA loan and \nwill benefit from the institutional support processes and structures established under MDP \n(Appendix 5). Assisted by SMEDA, the MDP team will fulfill all requirements for registering \nREMC and obtaining a license to operate under Section 42 of the Companies Ordinance 1984, \nincluding the preparation of the memorandum and articles of association, a business plan, and \nstandard operating procedures. The REMC board of directors will be drawn largely from the \nprivate sector. The MDP consultants will prepare a list of potential candidates for the board in \nconsultation with a variety of public and private stakeholder organizations.16 Government will \nconsult with ADB before the notification of the board and its composition. \n \n30.  To build a business-oriented vision of rural modernization initiated under the TA loan, \nand subject to the established feasibility of setting up REMC, the MDP team will assist the \nGovernment in operationalizing REMC, which will initially take on the MDP activities. Beyond \nthe life of the TA loan, REMC will be responsible for expanding its geographic outreach by \nundertaking rural industry development projects in additional subsectors and clusters identified \nas having good prospects for growth. Research into new opportunities for rural enterprise \ndevelopment will be a core REMC activity. REMC\u2019s approach to developing rural industries will \nevolve through the lessons learned from the pilot projects supported under the TA loan. To \nsucceed, REMC must be both a doer and a learning organization that experiments with creative \napproaches to rural development. Besides establishing REMC, a major objective of the TA loan \nwill be to develop the competence and experience that will guide the company beyond the TA \nloan period. It is envisioned that ADB may provide additional funding to REMC to expand its \noperations after the period. \n \n31.  The MDP team and REMC will encourage socially responsible business practices and \nsocial protection measures among rural businesses through awareness-raising campaigns by \nNGOs and incentive schemes to address issues such as child labor, gender-sensitive labor \npractices, environmental safeguards, the work environment, and fair remuneration and working \nhours. Other issues to be addressed include: patents, property rights franchising arrangements, \nand rationalization of taxes. Initiatives will also be taken to link the TA loan\u2019s target groups to \nongoing social service and community development programs under the rural support programs \nacross the four provinces.17 Linking up with rural support programs and other NGOs will be \nparticularly useful in mobilizing women and gaining credibility in conservative communities. \n \n32.  Consistent with the approach adopted for the SMESDP, REMC, provided its feasibility \nhas been established, will be registered and established in Lahore under the auspices of the \nMinistry of Industries, Production, and Special Initiatives (MoIPSI). The Government will provide \nfunds to REMC on a grant basis, and assets of the rural enterprise modernization cell will be \ntransferred to REMC upon its establishment through the articles of association. REMC will be \nfully autonomous and will report to an independent board of directors, comprising at least six \nmembers from the private sector and three from the public sector. REMC will be led by an \ninternationally experienced chief executive officer to be appointed by the board following a \ntransparent, nationally publicized, competitive recruitment, on a no-objection basis from ADB. \nThe chief executive officer will be supported by a core management team. To ensure the \nsmooth transition of knowledge resources and partnerships generated, staff associated with the \nrural  enterprise  modernization  cell  would  qualify  for  recruitment  for  REMC,  subject  to \n                                                 \n16  These include the Lahore University of Management Sciences, institutions engaged in microfinance or small \nbusiness lending, apex bodies such as the Pakistan Microfinance Network, and corporate firms with rural focus. \n17  There are at least eight rural support programs in Pakistan, principally emulating the AKRSP model at the national \nand district levels. \n ", "  11\ndemonstrated  performance,  compatibility  with  the  organization  structure  of  REMC,  and \nendorsement  by  the  REMC  board  in  consultation  with  ADB.  All  other  professional  staff \nrecruitments will be outsourced to a human resource consultant and the final selection will be \nendorsed by the REMC board.  \n \n33.  After REMC is established, the knowledge management systems developed by the MDP \nteam will be transferred to the company, and it will be responsible for analyzing potential \nopportunities in the selected subsectors, and for implementing the pilot projects. Expansion of \nscope and outreach will be undertaken following the evaluation of the first year of its operations, \nso that lessons learned can be incorporated in the ensuing work program of REMC. This \nassessment will allow REMC to put in place mechanisms for selecting additional subsectors, \npreferably in remote and disadvantaged locations, and designing intervention strategies and \nplans  for  supporting  small  rural  businesses  and  social  and  environmental  compliance.  As \nneeded,  REMC  will  outsource  specific  tasks  to  a  roster  of  international  and  domestic \nconsultants, including designers, information and communication technology (ICT) specialists, \nlawyers, and others. The immediate task of the core management team will be to develop \nguidelines and procedures for ensuring geographic outreach and undertaking rural industry \nresearch and development projects based on subsectors identified by the MDP team. This will \nalso allow REMC to develop the competence and experience that can guide the company \nbeyond the TA loan period. It is envisioned that ADB may consider additional funding to REMC \nto prepare ensuing investments supporting rural enterprise modernization. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.   Complementarity with Other Development Projects \n \n34.  The  TA  loan  is  a  unique  initiative  to  strengthen  rural  nonfarm  enterprises  and  will \ncomplement the interventions of SMESDP and ADP. The TA loan will focus on investigating and \ndeveloping the latent potential of business groups in the rural nonfarm economy. This focus \ndiffers from the urban-based approach of SMESDP and the agribusiness focus of the ADP. At \nthe same time, coordination and networking with SMESDP and ADP will ensure experience \nsharing and synergy. Coordination with rural support programs and NGOs will enable the REMC \nto  facilitate  access  to  enterprising  communities  and  linkages  with  social  interventions  in \neducation,  health,  and  small  infrastructure  projects.  Collaboration  with  these  partners  will \nenhance the leverage for policy advocacy on behalf of the rural poor. \n \n35.  Employment Practices. Efforts will be made to contribute to the promotion of socially \nresponsive initiatives through pilot interventions. Capacity building and awareness measures, \namong  others,  will  be  included  to  ensure  that  relevant  International  Labour  Organization \nconventions  (182  and  138)  are  not  breached.  Experiences  within  Pakistan,  particularly  in \nSialkot, provide useful insights. International companies sourcing sports goods from Pakistan \nhave appointed NGOs and other groups to monitor labor practices in MSEs making soccer balls \nin Pakistan. There is an increased effort on a global level to strengthen internal monitoring \nefforts and ensure that suppliers comply with local laws and company guidelines relating to the \nnonuse of child labor. Some of these companies use NGOs, while others use not-for-profit \norganizations that provide auditing and monitoring services to ensure that their company codes \nare implemented. \n \n  2.  Forms of Outreach  \n \n36.  The Project will work actively with district governments and stakeholders to enhance BDS \ncapacity in the rural areas. A particular focus will be to support grassroots enterprise experience to \n ", "12 \ndemonstrate  to  district  governments  that  off-farm  business  development  is  possible  in  their \ndistricts. In the rural areas there are quite a few enterprising individuals, both men and women, \nwho have gained experience or received some basic training in small business development and \nare  associated  with  local  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations  or  businesses  in  rural \nlocations. Microfinance institutions and rural support programs also have a sizable client base. \nThese entrepreneurs and community activists could also be brought into the business networks to \nenhance market contacts. These available resources will have to be tapped, and then plans will \nhave to be made to strengthen and organize their capacity. Local entrepreneurs and community \nactivists who know very well the communities they live and work in have an essential role to play \nin facilitating off-farm business development services.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n37.  The estimated  project  cost is $6.5  million  equivalent, inclusive  of physical and  price \ncontingencies, duties and taxes, and interest and service charges during implementation (Table \n1). The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $2.6 million, or 40% of the total cost. The local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $3.9 million equivalent, 60% of the total cost.

Financing Plan \n \n38.  The Government has requested a TA loan of $5 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the cost. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nduring amortization. The TA loan will fund the entire foreign currency cost of $2.6 million and \n$2.4 million equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government has agreed to provide $1.5 \nmillion, or 23% of the project cost, to meet part of the local currency expenditures. The use of \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  and  local  cost  financing  is  justified  because  TA  loan \ncomponents will act as a catalyst to develop poor rural enterprises.

Cofinancing in conjunction with the proposed TA loan is not envisioned at the moment \nbut  may  be  mobilized  from  both  official  (loan  and  grant)  and  commercial  sources  for  the \nprojects/program to be detailed under the proposed TA loan. For cofinancing from commercial \nsources, such cofinancing may benefit from ADB credit enhancement, including ADB guarantee \ninstruments, and will be presented separately for Board consideration as and when needs arise.  \n \n40.  Request for Retroactive Financing. To ensure a fast start-up, the Government has \nalready identified product groups and established high-level committees. Support is being \nsolicited from the private sector in identifying product development opportunities based on \nmarket  requirements.  To  maintain  this  momentum,  the  Government  wants  to  proceed \nurgently with the establishment of a rural enterprise modernization cell in SMEDA, staffed by \nexperienced  professionals.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  retroactive \nfinancing  for  the  recruitment  of  a  team  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  with \nrelevant private sector experience to staff the cell and establish an office presence in the \nfour provinces until the TA loan takes effect. Subject to ADB approval, international and \ndomestic consultants  will be  recruited according to  the relevant ADB  guidelines. These \neligible  expenditures  are  not  likely  to  exceed  $80,000.  Retroactive  financing  has  been \napproved  in  principle  by  the  Management  Review  Meeting  and  is  reported  in  the  ADB \nBusiness Opportunities but is subject to approval by the Board. The Government has been \nadvised that the provision of retroactive financing, with effect from 16 September 2005, does \nnot commit ADB to financing any part of this technical assistance loan. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements  \n  1.  Project Management \n \n41.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the TA loan will be MoIPSI which will be responsible for \noverall project facilitation, management, and monitoring.  MoIPSI shall nominate a joint secretary \nas project coordinator for the overall coordination and implementation of the Project. The project \ncoordinator will coordinate with SMEDA on the activities undertaken by MDP and once the \ndecision is made to establish REMC, will ensure its timely incorporation and establishment as a \nnot-for-profit company. SMEDA will be the Implementing Agency responsible for components 1 \nand 2 (Market Development Preparation, and Sector Analysis and Pilot Interventions). SMEDA \nwill oversee the establishment of REMC, subject to ADB\u2019s approval of its establishment, until its \nboard of directors is appointed. Thereafter, REMC will operate as an autonomous not-for-profit \ncompany. \n \n42.  SMEDA\u2019s financial management systems will be relied upon for the implementation of \ncomponents 1 and 2. SMEDA will be responsible for (i) recruiting, under the supervision of the \n ", "14 \nsteering  committee,  the  team  of  consultants  for  MDP  and  staff  for  the  rural  enterprise \nmodernization cell; and (ii) facilitating the establishment of the rural enterprise modernization \ncell and its subunits in the Project area. In addition, within 6 months of loan effectiveness, \nSMEDA, through the team of MDP consultants, will determine the subsector selection criteria in \nconjunction with other stakeholders. SMEDA will ensure that an appraisal unit is established \nwithin 9 months of loan effectiveness to assess the potential clusters and subsectors for the \npilot projects. The appraisal unit will be headed by the team leader responsible for MDP and \nshall comprise two members of the MDP team, the subsector development team leader, and the \ncluster development manager. SMEDA will facilitate workshops and seminars to engage rural \nbusinesses in the subsector analysis and in the review of the pilot project experiences. SMEDA \nwill also facilitate arrangements for training and capacity building for cooperating institutions \n(e.g., field-based organizations providing access to communities and linkages to microfinance \nopportunities) and rural entrepreneurs. Outreach will be tailored to the specific needs of a given \ngeographic area and the operational circumstances of the sectors in which interventions are \nmade. The central office for MDP will be in Lahore, and small regional offices will be established \nin selected regions/peri-urban areas. A subsector development team leader will lead the pilot \ndevelopment  projects,  and  for  outreach  he/she  will  have  a  team  of  five  cluster/subsector \ndevelopment managers, based in the regions to ensure geographical coverage throughout the \nproject area. These managers will supervise and guide all the sector development projects in \ntheir regions. Actual outreach within a cluster will be undertaken by a cluster development \nofficer from the same geographic area, who will be based in close geographic proximity to \nhis/her cluster, and recruited through a competitive process. To enhance outreach, functional \nlinks will be established with district governments, rural support programs, and NGOs. Formal \nand  on-the-job  training,  workshops,  and  trainer/mentor  relationships  between  central  and \nprovincial staff, and provincial and cluster-based staff, will be key links in the outreach. \n \n43.  Oversight of the TA loan\u2019s implementation will be undertaken by a steering committee \nchaired  by  the  minister  of  MoIPSI  with  representation  from  the  economic  affairs  division, \nministry of commerce, MoIPSI, SMEDA, Khushali Bank, six private sector representatives (at \nleast two of whom will be women), and the project coordinator. The steering committee shall \ncoopt other members on a need basis. The steering committee will meet as often as required \nbut at least once every 6 months. It will provide strategic and policy guidance to the MDP team \nand REMC, approve the annual work plans and budgets, monitor and evaluate performance, \nand facilitate intersectoral and interdepartmental coordination. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n44.  The TA loan will be utilized over 3 years. This will allow time to set up a functional rural \nenterprise modernization cell at SMEDA, and subsequently REMC (if found feasible), undertake \nthe comprehensive subsector analyses, and initiate work on core pilot project interventions, \nwhich  are  critical  for  designing  follow-on  interventions  to  promote  market-led  growth.  The \nestablishment of an appropriate institution to steer the process of rural enterprise modernization \nwill require extensive stakeholder consultations within the Government and with private sector \norganizations. More importantly, sufficient time is required for a careful assessment of relevant \ninitiatives in the region and their applicability to Pakistan. A comprehensive capacity-building \nprogram and the task of designing the pilot projects will allow the staff at the rural enterprise \nmodernization cell to gain hands-on experience in implementing a facilitative program, so that \nthe  lessons  can  feed  into  institutional  development  approaches  required  for  a  scaled-up \nprogram that ADB may later support. The MDP office and basic support staff required for the \nrural enterprise modernization cell will be assigned within 1 month of loan effectiveness, and the \nfirst four pilot projects (including two focused on women) will be developed within 12 months of \n ", "  15\nloan effectiveness. If its establishment is approved, the REMC will be incorporated within 24 \nmonths of loan effectiveness (Appendix 7). \n \n  3.  Procurement \n \n45.  Goods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will be \nprocured through international competitive bidding if they cost more than $500,000 equivalent, or \nby international shopping if they cost from $100,000 to $500,000 equivalent. If there are several \nlocal suppliers with satisfactory service facilities, equipment or materials valued at less than \n$100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding.  The  equipment  or \nmaterials may be directly purchased if they cost less than $50,000 (Appendix 8).    \n \n4.  Consulting Services and Technical Assistance \n46.  Consulting services are required for technical inputs and core project management. The \nTA loan will provide 108 person-months of international consulting services and 218 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services (Appendix 9). All consultants will be recruited according \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for \nselection  and  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Except  for  the  international  team \nleader/senior markets development specialist, who will be recruited as an individual consultant, \nthe core international and local consultants will be recruited through a firm, with the use of the \nquality  and  cost\u2013based  system.  In  addition  to  the  core  consulting  services,  NGOs  will  be \nengaged  individually  as  needed  to  provide  inputs  in  the  market  surveys,  organize  small \nentrepreneurs,  and  organize  training  workshops  and  focus  group  discussions  on  potential \nopportunities  in  selected  locations.  Of  the  consultant  services  total  indicated  above, \napproximately 72 person-months of international services and 170 person-months of domestic \nservices will be available in a flexible resource pool to be tapped when needs arise (e.g., market \nresearchers, subject matter and sector specialists, designers, ICT experts, process engineers, \nand poverty, gender, and environment specialists).  \n \n  5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n47.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan and Ministry of Industries, Production, and Special Initiatives. Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB reserves the \nright to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or \ncoercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the \nProject. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the \nExecuting Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n48.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. To expedite disbursements, an imprest account will be established \nand maintained by SMEDA at the National Bank of Pakistan for the implementation of the MDP \ncomponent. After REMC is established and enters into a project agreement with ADB, REMC \nwill  set  up  an  imprest  account  for  its  operation.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established, \nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \n ", "16 \nand  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  statement  of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedure will be used in reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating \nthe imprest account for any individual payment transaction of up to $100,000 equivalent. The \ninitial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  approved  contracts  and  planned \nexpenditures for the first 6 months of the Project. However, total advances at any time are not to \nexceed  estimated  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  total  loan  amount, \nwhichever is less.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  In each year of implementation, the EA will provide ADB with concise quarterly reports \ndetailing  the  physical  and  financial  progress  of  activities  against  agreed  targets  and \nsummarizing the results of benefit monitoring and evaluation. SMEDA and REMC (upon its \nestablishment) will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices financed from loan proceeds, the expenditures incurred, and the use of local funds. \nAccounts will be established and maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples and following the guidelines and procedures of the Ministry of Finance. Consolidated \nproject accounts and related financial statements will be compiled and audited annually by \nindependent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited accounts, audit report, and \nrelated financial statements will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after the \nfiscal year to which they relate and should include an audit with a separate opinion on the use of \nthe  imprest  account  and  SOE  procedure.  SMEDA  has  financial  controls  in  place  and  the \naccounts are subject to government procedures and regular audit by independent auditors \nappointed by the SMEDA board. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n50.  MoIPSI will ensure that SMEDA takes steps to set up a project performance management \nsystem (PPMS) as agreed with ADB, within 6 months of the effective date, cause it to be operated \nthroughout the project period, and transfer it to REMC upon its establishment. Under the PPMS, \nMoIPSI shall also periodically review the Project to assess and evaluate its scope, implementation \narrangements,  benefit  monitoring,  progress,  and  achievements.  Within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion,  MoIPSI  shall  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  a  detailed \nevaluation of the progress implementation, costs, consultants\u2019 performance, social and economic \nimpact, and other details requested by ADB. \n \n51.  Within 6 months of the effective date, the Government shall ensure that the gender \nstrategy described in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy plan (Appendix 10) has \nbeen refined and that a gender-disaggregated PPMS has been established as agreed with \nADB.  Within  9  months  of  the  effective  date,  the  detailed  plan  for  gender-disaggregated \nperformance monitoring for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence shall be finalized and the baseline \nsurvey for selected subsectors shall be completed.    \n \n52.  The PPMS will be in line with the performance measurement framework to be developed \nin detail for all three components. In component 1, the performance measurement framework \nwill include a detailed set of criteria for the selection of subsectors, the design of the studies and \ndata collection, and the evaluation of the quality of the studies and data and their usefulness to \nthe pilot projects and REMC. Component 2 will involve three activities: (i) detailed design of the \nselection  of  pilot  projects  and  their  rationale;  (ii)  monthly  or  quarterly  monitoring  of \nimplementation, using monitoring indicators to link inputs to output; and (iii) for each pilot \nproject,  evaluation  of  the  outcome  (output-to-outcome  relationships)  against  expectations, \n ", "  17\nincluding successes and failures and the reasons for them (market size, product quality, types \nof  services  and  products,  competitiveness,  penetration  or  reach  in  domestic  and  foreign \nmarkets, socioeconomic profile of producers and consumers, etc). Component 3 will require (i) \nregular monitoring (financial and administrative) using performance indicators, (ii) evaluation of \noutreach activities based on the lessons from the pilot projects, and (iii) assessment of the \nimpact of the pilot projects and outreach programs. Impact assessment would focus on the \noutcomes of the pilot projects and REMC outreach. \n \n9.   Project Review \n \n53.  During the period of the TA loan, ADB will carry out an annual review to (i) determine if \nall implementation arrangements are in place and are appropriate and effective, (ii) assess the \noutcome of the capacity-building activities and training programs, (iii) assess the progress of \nbusiness and market development at the village and local levels, and (iv) recommend changes \nin implementation arrangements, as required. \n \n54.  It is recognized that the Project will demand close monitoring and supervision so that the \nnecessary corrective actions can be determined at an early stage. Quarterly progress review \nmissions are therefore necessary in the first year of implementation. Thereafter, missions will \nreview the Project every 6 months. Adequate support from the Pakistan Resident Mission \n(PRM), regularly provided, will be critical to ensure effective supervision by ADB.18 A midterm \nreview mission is planned 18 months after the effective date to discuss with the Government the \nfeasibility  of  establishing  REMC  and  alternate  strategies  and  options  for  supporting  the \ndevelopment of BDS in the rural areas. \n \n55.  Periodic stakeholder workshops will be held to discuss and document experiences. \nEighteen months after the inception of the TA loan, an independent assessment of the project \nwill  be  undertaken19 by  consultants  with  experience  in  rural  enterprise  development.  The \nobjective will be to draw lessons and operational insights from the pilot projects, to identify best \npractices and initiatives, and to use the insights and knowledge gained to inform the subsequent \nagenda and programs of REMC. The findings of stakeholder workshops and the independent \nassessment  will  be  crucial  for  the  development  of  follow-on  initiatives  to  scale  up  the \ninterventions across a wider geographic and sectoral range. \n \nIV.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.   Economic Impact and Benefits \n \n56.  In essence, the TA loan is a pilot exercise that will assess constraints and opportunities \nin  the  rural  nonfarm  sector  and  develop  an  institutional  framework  to  facilitate  enterprise \ndevelopment and a more modern approach to rural business through better design, technology, \nand marketing. The direct long-term benefits will flow from increased nonfarm employment and \nincome-earning opportunities in the rural areas, particularly for wage earners, women, and poor \nproducer groups with the potential to engage in a higher level of commercial activity. These \ndevelopments will be a consequence of addressing the market gaps and failures in selected \nsubsectors, and strengthening the competitive position of the MSEs operating within those \nsubsectors. These measures are expected to increase the value added in the products sold and \nimprove commercial linkages between rural MSEs and the larger urban businesses. Each rural \nindustry  has  a  large  number  of  MSEs,  many  of  which  are  in  households.  As  the  Project \n                                                 \n18  Given the proposed focus on innovative initiatives in the rural development sector, posting a sector specialist in \nPRM to support ADB interventions must be a priority.   \n19  To be selected by MoIPSI and approved by the steering committee. \n ", "18 \ndevelops beyond the TA loan period, it is expected that the know-how developed by the pilot \ninitiatives will be transferred to a wider group of rural enterprises. Indirect benefits will arise from \nthe strengthening of rural knowledge and human capital, and a reduction in the incentives for \nrural\u2013urban migration. \n \n57.  It is expected that the TA loan\u2019s outputs will result in measurable financial and economic \nbenefits for the targeted enterprises and industries. Overall, the TA loan is a catalyst and the full \neconomic impact will arise through multiplier effects on the target industries, communities and \ngroups. Because of the importance of the multiplier for the achievement of project goals, the \nlinkages between the direct activities of the TA loan and the wider rural economy must be \nconsidered in plans for REMC to continue beyond the TA loan. The TA loan is considered as a \nfirst step in a longer program that will refine the approaches to rural enterprise modernization \nand extend these approaches to a wider rural base (Supplementary Appendix D). \n  \nB.  Environmental and Social Impacts \n \n58.  The  TA  loan  is  classified  as  category  C  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines. The focus is on sector analysis and the creation of an institutional \nframework for facilitating rural nonfarm development, and therefore the TA loan will not entail \ninvoluntary resettlement or have adverse impact on indigenous peoples or the environment \n(Appendix  10).  In  addition,  no  adverse  environmental  impact  is  expected  from  the  pilot \ninitiatives. As a check on environmental concerns, and for enhanced environmental awareness \namong rural enterprises, consultants will prepare guidelines and provide training in social and \nenvironmental screening during the preparation of subsector plans and interventions, including \nthe pilot projects. Periodic monitoring by poverty, gender, and environmental consultants will \nensure that the TA loan\u2019s interventions are socially and environmentally sound. \n \n59.  The TA loan will have positive social impact through increased rural employment and \nhousehold  incomes.  A  systemic  attempt  will  be  made  to  reach  rural  women.  Women  will \nparticipate actively in the surveys and analyses, and women-managed enterprises will receive \nspecialized technical and managerial support. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n60.  The project design makes a number of assumptions with associated risks. It is assumed \nthat the Government remains strongly committed to ensuring enhanced market opportunities \nand competitiveness of rural enterprises, especially for those groups that now lack access to \nmarkets.  The  present  Government  has  demonstrated  strong  ownership  and  commitment \nthrough a focus on addressing constraints on market access in the rural areas. It is recognized \nthat the project design will require a knowledge-intensive approach, with a high degree of \nresponsiveness to emerging market opportunities. In addition, there is a need to work with a \nnumber of institutions both within and outside government. Extensive consultations with all \nstakeholders, including the private sector, and high-level government support if not realized can \ncause delays and may limit the understanding and development of appropriate institutional \nprocesses  required  to  support  the  competitiveness  of  rural  enterprises.  These  risks  are \naddressed through the creation of a high-level steering committee with adequate representation \nfrom the government and private sector. In addition, the Project provides flexibility in engaging \nthe private sector and other stakeholders in all undertakings, and on-time availability of a range \nof consultants with demonstrated technical knowledge and international experience to analyze \nsubsectors and design initiatives responsive to market opportunities in the rural areas. The need \nto stimulate improvements in the design and quality of products and to ensure compliance by \nthe  rural  enterprises  with  labor  laws  and  other  regulations  is  addressed  through  a \n ", "  19\ncomprehensive  subsector  analysis  followed  by  carefully  designed  pilot  interventions  with \nappropriate social safeguards and processes and private sector linkages. The results of the \nsubsector analysis and pilot projects will, in turn, form the basis for the business plan for an \ninstitution  to  support  the  development  of  business  opportunities  for  rural  entrepreneurs, \nespecially those who exhibit substantial business potential but have no access to the required \nresources, knowledge, and support. The proposed sequencing of implementation will help in \npreparing relevant area- and product-specific strategies for promoting business development \nand in minimizing the risks associated with setting up an institution that may otherwise fail to be \nsocially responsive, sustainable, and relevant to the needs of the underserved and new small \nrural entrepreneurs. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n61.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that adequate counterpart funds are made available \nfor the implementation of the TA loan. \n(ii)  The Government will provide adequate office space for the TA loan. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the facilities provided under the TA loan are \noperated and maintained appropriately and adequate budget will be provided for \nthis purpose. \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that all the interventions/investments meet, to the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB,  the  agreed  selection  criteria  and  implementation \narrangements and that all interventions are, to the satisfaction of ADB, properly \ncontrolled and monitored. \n(v)  The Government will ensure compliance with all applicable labor laws, including \nthe prohibition of child labor, and equal pay for men and women for work of equal \nvalue for activities under this TA loan. Compliance with these provisions will be \nstrictly monitored during the TA loan\u2019s implementation.  \n(vi)  Within 1 month of loan effectiveness, recruitment of the team leader for MDP will \nbe completed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. \nDetailed  terms  of  reference,  selection  criteria,  and  recommendations  on  the \nselection of the candidate together with the draft contract will be submitted for \nADB\u2019s approval. \n(vii)  Within 1 month of loan effectiveness, the Government will designate an officer of \nthe level of a joint secretary at MoIPSI for the overall coordination of the TA loan.  \n(viii)  Within 18 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will submit to ADB the \nfeasibility study on the establishment of REMC; and subject to its feasibility being \napproved by ADB, within 24 months of loan effectiveness the Government will \nensure that (a) REMC is incorporated as a not-for-profit company under Section \n42 of the Companies Ordinance 1984; (b) the board of directors of REMC will \nhave at least nine members with at least six from the private sector, including two \nwomen; (c) immediately following incorporation, the board of directors approves  \nan  annual  business  plan,  standard  operating  procedures,  conflict-of-interest \nrules, and code of conduct for staff and directors. \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that REMC, immediately following its incorporation, \nwill enter into a project agreement with ADB setting out its responsibilities.  \n ", "20 \n(x)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will ensure that a first-\nyear work plan for the TA loan will be prepared and submitted for ADB approval. \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that the Project will not cause any land acquisition, \nresettlement,  or  limits  on  access  to  land.  Furthermore,  the  Government  will \nensure that affected indigenous peoples will have opportunities to participate in \nand benefit equitably from the Project. The Government will also ensure that the \nProject will not cause any negative environmental impact.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n62.  The following conditions for loan effectiveness have been incorporated into the Draft \nLoan Agreement: \n \n(i)  The Government shall provide a legal opinion satisfactory to ADB. \n(ii)  SMEDA will enter into a project agreement with ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n63.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 3,505,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Rural Enterprise \nModernization Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n10 January 2006 \n ", "Appendix 1          21 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanism \nImpact        \nStrengthen and diversify  \u2022  Increase in number of  \u2022  District surveys and  Assumption \nemployment opportunities  micro- and small  statistical data  Government has the \nin the nonfarm sector  enterprises (MSEs) over  \u2022  National Household  ability and willingness to \nespecially for the poor and  the baseline in 2006 by  and Income  facilitate rural and peri-\nvulnerable groups such as  locality, subsector, and  Expenditure Surveys  urban business \nthe landless, low-wage  gender   \u2022  Subsector industry  development investments \nearners, and women.   \u2022  Increase in number of  surveys  that are not only pro-poor \nwomen in paid    but are gender-sensitive \nworkforce in nonfarm  and also address social \nenterprises by  concerns. \nsubsector   \n\u2022  Increase in number of  Risk \nlandless poor in  Civil and political unrest \nnonfarm enterprises as  makes it difficult to \nentrepreneurs  develop business \n\u2022  Increase in the level of  activities.

Overview of the Informal Sector \n \n1.  Pakistan\u2019s informal sector1 makes a substantial contribution to gross domestic product \n(GDP). About 85% of exports from Pakistan are from agri-based industry (textiles and apparel \nmake  up  65%  of  agri-based  industry  exports).2 Transport,  communications,  and  social, \ncommunity and personal services also contribute significantly. According to the Labor Force \nSurvey (2003\u20132004), about two thirds of the nonfarm employed labor force is engaged in \ninformal sector activities. Employment in rural areas in the informal sector is 10% higher than in \nthe towns. Informal activities are highest in Punjab and lowest in Balochistan. \n \n2.  The informal sector is composed of self-employed and wage employees. The proportion \nof unpaid family helpers is very low in the sector compared with the agriculture sector (Figure). \n \nFigure A2: \nPercentage Distribution of Employed Persons in Informal Sector \nin Rural Pakistan, 2001\u20132002 \nEmployer\n1%\nEmployee  Self employed\n44%  45%\nUnpaid family \nhelper\n10%\nSource: Labor Force Survey (2001-2002). \n \n                    \n3.  Women compose only 9% of the work force in the informal sector. Men predominate in \nwholesale trade and related work as managers, while women, with their lower levels of skill and \ncapital, as well as the cultural restrictions female workers face, are engaged in manufacturing as \ncraft and related workers. The informal sector is also characterized by long working hours and low \nwage rates, especially for women. If the proposed technical assistance (TA) loan can influence \nthe proportion of women employed, then even a relatively small increase in the proportion of \nwomen employed makes a large difference in their total employment (e.g., a 1% increase in the \nproportion of women employed represents an 11% increase in female employment). \n                                                 \n1  The informal sector as defined by the structure of the organization and the size of the establishment includes family \nenterprise/industrial establishments with fewer than 10 workers and nonindustrial establishments with not more \nthan 20 workers. \n2  The value added of the informal sector in Pakistan cannot be directly estimated at the moment, since no special \nenterprise (or mixed) survey has been carried out so far. \n ", "28          Appendix 2 \n4.  Most of the nonfarm establishments in rural Pakistan are informal except those in the \nenergy, finance and insurance, social services, and mining sectors (Table A2.1).

It is assumed that a transition from a household business to a small business with \nemployees  is  an  indicator  of  commercial  development.  The  data  in  Table  A2.2  show  an \naggregate decline in household units and an increase in small establishments from 1983\u20131984 \nto 1996\u20131997 in rural Pakistan.4 A later survey (Household, Income, and Expenditure Survey \n2001\u20132002) shows that more than 50% of the industrial units are in Punjab (mainly in the south \nand central districts), 27% are in NWFP (largely textiles and carpets), 13% in Sindh (wood and \nfood  products),  and  8%  in  Balochistan.  In  rural  Balochistan  only  2%  of  households  had \nmanufacturing units. Overall, this suggests a trend toward viable small businesses that the \nproposed Project can build on. However, provincial data show that this transition is happening \nonly in Punjab and NWFP (where the greatest percentage increase in small business has \noccurred). The data show an increase in household units and a decline in small establishments \nin Sindh and Balochistan. The reasons for this change are unknown,5 but will be examined \nunder the TA loan\u2019s Market Development Preparation studies. \n \nTable A2.3 \nDistribution of Labor, Capital, Output, and Value Added Across Selected Small Industries \nin Rural Pakistan, 1996\u20131997 \n \nPersons  Fixed  Value  Input-\nEngaged  Assets  Production  Industrial  Added  Output \nIndustry  Units (%)  (%)  (%)  (%)  Cost (%)  (%)  Ratioa \nWheat milling  20.4  11.9 41.1 15.0 14.4  15.6 0.46\nMade-up textile  10.1  6.8 0.7 1.8 0.5  3.0 0.14\nWoolen carpets  8.4  8.2 0.9 3.2 1.5  4.8 0.23\nWooden furniture  4.3  3.2 3.6 4.7 4.7  4.7 0.48\nSawmills  3.1  2.8 10.4 4.0 3.4  4.7 0.40\nJewelry  2.8  1.6 2.0 5.6 8.0  3.5 0.68\nOther handicrafts  2.7  2.5 2.0 1.0 0.7  1.2 0.34\nTobacco stemming  1.9  10.5 1.8 1.9 1.8  2.0 0.47\nAgri machinery  1.4  0.9 1.6 1.4 1.5  1.3 0.52\nBricks and tiles  1.3  7.8 6.0 17.2 18.4  16.0 0.52\nCotton weaving \n(finish)  0.9  1.5 3.5 4.0 5.1  3.1 0.61\nOther leather \nproducts  0.5  0.9 1.7 2.9 2.8  3.1 0.46\nSilk spinning and \nweaving  0.3  1.0 2.1 3.5 4.1  2.9 0.57\n  Total  58.1  59.5 77.4 66.3 66.9  65.7 0.49\nAll other industries  41.9  40.5 22.6 33.7 33.1  34.3 0.47\n  Total Rural \n  Pakistan (%)  100  100 100 100 100  100 0.48\n  Total Rural \n  Pakistan \n  (units)  252,706  686,376 10,417 24,582 11,897  12,685  \na   Input-output ratio indicates that jewelry is the most input-intensive industry.

Table A2.3 gives an overview of the 13 industries that employ more than 60% of the \nrural population, hold the most assets, and add the greatest value in their activities. Wheat \nmilling and tobacco stemming (i.e., primary processing of leaves) employ the most people, while \nthere has been a shift away from employment in woolen carpet manufacture. Brick and tile units \nemploy more people on a unit basis than any other industry. \n \n8.  Brick and tile units also add the most value, followed by wheat milling (mainly in Punjab). \nIn contrast, textiles and carpet making (mainly in NWFP) are low-value-added industries but \nemploy 15% of the rural workers engaged in small and household manufacturing units. These \nindustries appear to be the most labor-intensive and low-capital industries. \n \nC.  Issues and Constraints: Case Studies of Rural Subsectors \n \n1.  The Handloom Industry in Punjab \n9.  The hand-loom industry is an old and traditional industry in Pakistan (and India). Various \nproducts are produced, such as bedsheets, carpets, cushion covers, duster-khwans, khes, long \ncloth, lungies, napkins, pillow covers, table covers, and towels. This variety suggests that there \nis considerable demand and possible scope for expansion. The industry is labor-intensive and \nmainly employs poor wage laborers. For these reasons, the industry appears well suited for \nsupport under the Project. \n \n10.  About 30,000 hand-loom units exist in rural areas. This activity is very small-scale, low-\ninvestment, and mostly located at the household level. Almost all the units are located in Punjab \nwith about one third located in the district of Multan. Table A2.4 shows the basic statistics on the \nhand-loom industry in rural Punjab. It is this kind of basic data that will be gathered during the \ndiagnostic phase of the work and used as the basis for the pilot projects. \n  \nTable A2.4 \nHand-Loom Industry in Rural Punjab (1996\u20131997) \n \nHousehold  Small \nItem  Units  Establishments  Total Units \nNumber of units  2,384  517  2,901 \nPersons working  3,273  1,069  4,342 \nValue of fixed assets (PRs\u2019000)  4,781  13,028  17,809 \nValue of production (PRs\u2019000)  51,913  42,301  94,214 \nIndustrial and nonindustrial cost (PRs\u2019000)       \n  Raw material cost  4,309  21,387  25,696 \n  Fuel/Electricity cost  1,012  363  1,375 \n  Other industrial costs  1,282  120  1,402 \n  Indirect taxes  63  34  97 \n  Nonindustrial cost  1,054  116  1,170 \n  Total cost  7,720  22,020  29,740 \nValue added (PRs\u2019000)  44,193  20,281  64,474 \nNote: In the hand-loom industry, nonindustrial cost includes only travel and storage expenses.

The TA team will need to understand the overall business and economic environment in \nwhich the industry is operating. It should in many cases be able to do this from secondary data. \n ", "Appendix 2          31 \nIn the case of the hand-loom industry, considerable work has been undertaken by Punjab Small \nIndustries Corporation (PSIC), Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority (SMEDA), \nand United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).  \n \n12.  These data indicate that hand-loom units are declining at an alarming rate in Pakistan. In \n1947, there were 250,000 units. By 1998, there were only 50,000, and by 2005, only 30,000 \nunits. A large number of landless and nonfarm households are involved in this industry. Despite \ngreat potential for absorbing labor, this sector is in decline. Power looms are the main threat \nbecause they are cost-efficient compared with hand looms. Low levels of education, lack of \nawareness of market demand, and lack of know-how of quality products are also significant \nissues for the hand-loom industry, which faces these other constraints: \n \n(i)  There  are  few  raw  material  markets.  These  are  found  only  in  Karachi, \nFaisalabad, and Multan. \n(ii)  Because of the physical limitations of the hand loom, a cloth more than 10 yards \nlong cannot have a uniform design, and quality standardization is minimal. \n(iii)  Hand-loom weaving is no longer a family craft because of lack of government \ninterest. Low returns discourage the younger generation from working in this \ntrade.  \n(iv)  Despite great export potential, because of low production at one time, industry \nexports are negligible. \n \n2.  Handicrafts in the North-West Frontier Province \n13.  This industry has a high potential for employment, low investment, and high value-\nadded. In Pakistan, the handicraft industry manufactures a variety of products ranging from \nfabric  and  embroidery  to  jewelry,  carving,  and  mirror  work.  About  80  different  kinds  of \nhandicrafts are produced in Pakistan. The most prominent handicrafts are: leather goods, brass \ngoods and brass work, copper ware and tableware, onyx and marble products, woodcraft, textile \nand block-printing fabrics, embroideries, glass beads, traditional and contemporary jewelry, \ncamel-  and  snake-skin  products,  pottery,  hand-knitted  carpets  and  rugs,  shell  and  bone \nproducts, and costume dolls. However, like the hand-loom industry, this industry is losing its \ncraftsmanship. In 2001\u20132002, Pakistan exported $20 million worth of handicrafts. Handicraft \nexports increased to $27 million in 2002\u20132003. But from July to October 2004, these exports \namounted to only $1.6 million, against $4 million during the same period the previous year. \n \n14.  Handicrafts  are  a  largely  rural  activity,  with  64%  located  in  NWFP.  Specialized \nhandicrafts of the province include leather, wood, metal, wax painting, and printing. Table A2.5 \ngives the basic statistics on the handicraft industry in rural NWFP.  \n \nTable A2.5 \nHandicraft Industry in Rural NWFP, 1996\u20131997 \n \nHousehold  Small \nItem  Units  Establishments  Total Units \nNumber of units  4,332  1,821  6,153 \nPersons working  9,275  5,953  15,228 \nValue of fixed assets (PRs \u2019000)  19,781  188,162  207,943 \nValue of production (PRs \u2019000)  137,752  42,326  180,078 \nIndustrial and nonindustrial cost (PRs \u2019000)       \n  Raw material cost  30,384  21,356  51,740 \n ", "32          Appendix 2 \nHousehold  Small \nItem  Units  Establishments  Total Units \n  Fuel/Electricity cost  4,292  2,959  7,251 \n  Other industrial costs  4,986  2,786  7,772 \n  Indirect taxes  168  5  173 \n  Nonindustrial cost  295  7  302 \n  Total cost  40,125  27,113  67,238 \n  Value added (PRs\u2019000)  97,627  15,213  112,840 \nNote: As in the hand-loom industry, nonindustrial cost in the handicraft industry includes only travel and storage \nexpenses.

Although NWFP has the advantages of easy availability of various raw materials, the \nhandicraft industry is suffering because of lack of market and credit information and government \nsupport. \n \n3.  Pottery Industry in Sindh \n16.  The pottery industry is important in Pakistan in terms of employment. This industry has \ngreat export potential. However, work by PSIC and UNIDO shows a declining trend in pottery \nexports  and  increasing  trend  in  imports  for  this  industry.  It  is  beset  by  constraints  in  the \ntechnological, financial, human resources, and marketing areas.

For this industry to develop, modern technology must be introduced, and there must be \nbetter access to raw materials, credit, quality control services, and marketing. \n \nD.  Conclusion \n \n18.  The fact that so many of the poorest and least educated of the Pakistani labor force are \nemployed  in  rural  micro-  and  small  enterprises  (MSEs)  suggests  that  the  TA  loan  is  well \ntargeted. Small interventions to favorably alter the climate and operations of business can have \na  disproportionately  large  effect  on  wages,  incomes,  and  the  employment  of  the  worst-off \ngroups (e.g., women and the underemployed). \n ", "Appendix 3          33 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT \n \n    External \n    Assistance \nProject Title  Funding Agency  ($ million) \nAgribusiness Development Project  ADB  31.0 \nSmall and Medium Trade Enhancement Project  ADB  150.0 \nTrade Export Promotion and Industry  ADB  7.5 \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program  ADB  152.0 \nSmall  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector  Development  Program  ADB  18.0 \n(Project Loan) \nMicrofinance Sector Development Project  ADB  80.0 \nMicrofinance Sector Development Program  ADB  70.0 \nPakistan Poverty Alleviation Project \u2013 Phase 1   IBRD/IDA  90.0 \nSecond Poverty Alleviation Fund Project   IBRD/IDA  238.0 \n  IBRD/IDA  20.0 \nBanking Sector Technical Assistance Project   IBRD/IDA  26.5 \nState Bank Partnership for Microfinance  SDC  0.7 \nFinancial Sector Strengthening Program  SDC  2.4 \nEU Capacity Building for Trade-Related Activities     7.3 \nTrade Initiatives from a Human Development Perspective  UNDP  2.0 \nProposal to Support Craft-Based Enterprises  UNIDO  To be \napproved \nCompetitive Support Fund  USAID  10.0 \n     \nBilateral Assistancea      \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EU = European Union, IBRD = International Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, IDA = International Development Association, SDC = Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, \nUNDP = United Nations Development Programme, UNIDO = United Nations Industrial Development Organization, \nUSAID = United States Agency for International Development. \na   Enterprise development initiatives of the Aga Khan Rural Support Program, National Rural Support Programme, \nPunjab Rural Support Programme, and other nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have been financed by several \nbilateral  agencies  including  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  Canadian  International \nDevelopment Agency, and others.

Rural nonfarm growth has been most rapid in countries possessing a vibrant agriculture \nand a rapidly growing urban-industrial sector, as well as the requisite managerial and labor \nskills, ready markets for inputs and outputs (including financing), and good infrastructure. Public \nprovision of infrastructure\u2014roads, power, and telecommunications\u2014will obviously facilitate rural \nnonfarm dynamism. Rural nonfarm production has mostly comprised non-tradables produced by \nhouseholds and microenterprises (e.g., food processing, housing, retail trade, and services). In \na few East Asian countries\u2014People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Republic of Korea, Japan, and \nTaipei,China\u2014rural  industrialization  has  extended  to  larger-scale,  often  export-oriented, \nproduction of goods such as textiles and metal products. The central feature of Asia\u2019s rural \nnonfarm growth is that it has been led almost entirely by the market and the private sector. State \nefforts to promote rural industrialization directly have generally not succeeded on a broad scale \n(the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s township and village enterprises are the primary exception), \ndespite the appeal of arguments for enhancing efficient employment creation, alleviating rural \npoverty,  reducing  rural-to-urban  migration,  and  containing  the  external  costs  of  excessive \nurbanization.  \n \nA.  Insights from Donor-Supported Small Business Promotion Projects \n \n2.  After  several  years  of  efforts  to  build  a  consensus  on  principles  for  selecting  and \nsupporting intermediaries in micro- and small enterprises in finance, around the mid-1990s, the \nCommittee  of  Donor  Agencies  for  Small  Enterprise  Development1 turned  its  attention  to \nbusiness development services (BDS)\u2014the wide array of nonfinancial services that enable \nbusinesses to grow and develop. Motivating the search for a new paradigm for BDS was the \nrecognition that traditional interventions have failed to provide good-quality, affordable BDS to a \nlarge proportion of small enterprises. There was consensus that publicly funded services have \nnot achieved their objectives, since programs had had low impact, had limited outreach and cost \nefficiencies, and were not sustainable since service provision ended when program activities \nended. \n \n3.  Therefore, at its annual meeting in 1995, the donor committee decided to focus on BDS \nfor small enterprises, with the objective of identifying and documenting best practices in this \narea. Building on this work, between 1998 and 2000 a series of international and regional \nconferences were organized under the auspices of the donor committee. The BDS working \ngroup prepared a draft document with guiding principles based on the papers and discussions \nfrom these conferences. The draft served as the basis for discussion and for the emerging \nconsensus  on  principles  for  donor  interventions  in  BDS.  The  \u201cBDS  market  development \nparadigm\u201d grew out of a shred conviction within the donor community that achieving economic \nand social goals was possible only by relying on private sector actors to provide a diverse array \nof  services.  Relying  on  the  private  sector  to  achieve  greater  outreach  demanded  better \nunderstanding of how BDS providers could be financially self-sustaining or even profitable.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Members include Asian Development Bank,  Canadian International  Development  Agency, Department  for    \nInternational Development, European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische \nZusammenarbeit, International Fund for Agricultural Development, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Swiss \nAgency for Development and Cooperation, United Nations Development Programme, and United States Agency \nfor International Development.   \n ", "Appendix 4          35 \nB.  Up-Country Experience in Rural Business Promotion \n \n1.  Aga Khan Rural Support Program (AKRSP) \n \n4.  Over its 20-year-plus history, AKRSP has tried almost all models that were in vogue at \nany given time for supporting small businesses. Currently, AKRSP is pursuing the market \ndevelopment  approach and  developing  its  facilitative  role.  The  shift  from  one  paradigm  to \nanother has, however, been dictated not by theories but by hands-on experience of what works \nbest and what does not, and has been reinforced by international best practices. While lessons \nlearned by AKRSP in integrated rural development and microfinance have been well recognized \nand drawn upon, insights from AKRSP\u2019s extensive enterprise development history of over 20 \nyears\u2014the longest in the country for any organization supporting rural small businesses\u2014are \njust beginning to be tapped. It is expected that this experience will gain significance in the \ncoming years as small business promotion in rural areas gains momentum and attracts policy-\nlevel attention in meeting the poverty reduction goals of the Government. \n \n5.  Working Through Community Organizations. Experience gained in the early 1980s \nindicated that though the community organizations were effective in initiating and managing \npublic  projects,  the  success  of  a  business  project  rested  on  individual  profit  motivations, \nrequiring the skill and creativity of individual entrepreneurs rather than community groups, \nparticularly  since  not  all  members  of  a  group  would  have  the  inclination  or  the  drive  for \nbusiness. Issues of mistrust, and questions regarding profit allocations commensurate with the \ntime and hard work put in by different group members, further confirmed the nonviability of the \ncommunity organization for commercial activities. The marketing of fresh fruits and vegetables \nthrough village organizations had its demonstration and awareness-raising effects; nonetheless, \nthe business momentum was picking up more outside the community organizations rather than \nwithin. Additionally, the initial collectivist efforts were steered not by what would sell in the \nmarket but what could be grown in the northern regions, i.e., they were supply- rather than \ndemand-driven. The experience during this phase shattered the belief that the only issue was \nmarketing, highlighting the complexities of marketing, the significance of consumer demand, \ncompetition, and the synchronization of the production and marketing operations to compete \nfavorably. \n \n6.  Supporting  Individual  Entrepreneurs.  Subsequently,  AKRSP  shifted  its  focus  to \nsupporting individual entrepreneurs through a variety of capacity-building measures and equity \ncontributions.  Businesses  in  new  areas  were  established  and  existing  ones  strengthened. \nNonetheless, the cost of working directly with individual entrepreneurs was very high, and only a \nlimited number of entrepreneurs could be reached. Moreover, such direct support for small \nbusinesspeople  diluted  their  own  stakes  in  the  business,  created  dependency  on  external \nassistance,  and  raised  issues  about  the  sustainability  of  the  momentum  created  within  a \nbusiness once support was withdrawn. Most of all, concern about displacing private sector \nproviders of services and creating market distortions also arose.  \n \n7.  Creating and Working with Cooperatives. Driven by limited impact and cost-efficiency \nissues and in its efforts to multiply job and income-earning opportunities, AKRSP also tried to \nestablish cooperatives with a range of shareholders. These cooperatives remained dependent \non AKRSP for their day-to-day operational management because of low literacy levels and the \nlimited capacity of the managers to work independently. From this experience, AKRSP learned \nthree lessons, which influenced its decision to establish its wholly owned businesses. First, \nbusinesses needed to be established with well-researched profitability prospects. Second, they \nneeded to be established as business entities distinct from AKRSP with their own financial \n ", "36          Appendix 4 \nmanagement and accounting systems. And third, the job of managing a large business was \ncomplex  and  too  specialized  to  be  managed  by  largely  illiterate  poor  farmers,  whose \ncommercial  exposure  was  limited.  Subsequently,  criteria  for  establishing  wholly  owned \nbusinesses were established, not to open the doors to private sector investment but rather to \nmake AKRSP more cautious in its choice of investments. \n \n8.  Experience of Wholly Owned Businesses. AKRSP\u2019s direct interventions in the market \nwere  rationalized  by  the  absence  of  business  capacity  and  resources  within  the  northern \nregions to take on such ventures and the livelihood opportunities that these projects promised. \nFollowing a tight process of screening, more business ideas were rejected than accepted at \nAKRSP. Starting in the late 1990s, with cost-free donor funds and limited business experience, \nAKRSP  established  its  wholly  owned  businesses  in  four  subsectors  in  which the  northern \nregions were considered to have a competitive advantage (dry-fruit processing, woolen fabric \npatti/shu marketing, vegetable seed production and marketing, and coal mining). AKRSP had \nthe advantage of access to cost-free donor funds. The long-term objective was to make these \nprojects profitable and privatize them. \n \n2.  Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) \n \n9.  In 1997 SDC assisted the Karakorum Area Development Organization based in Hunza \n(Northern  Areas  of  Pakistan)  in  establishing  the  Threadnet  Project  (TP)  to  enhance  poor \nwomen\u2019s income-earning opportunities. Design, raw material purchase, product development, \nand marketing are centralized functions performed by TP. Women are contracted to work either \nat home or at the work centers of TP to produce a variety of hand-embroidered products such \nas pouches, key chains, handbags, and belts. The embroidery skills of more than 300 women \nhave been polished and they are earning about PRs1,500 to PRs2,500 per month (on a piece-\nrate basis). The projects sell mainly among visiting tourists in the northern regions of Pakistan, \nthough efforts have also been made to tap selective stores down-country. The project lacks in-\nhouse business and design expertise and is heavily dependent on donor funding. The prospects \nof the project becoming a financially sustainable business are suspect. SDC is currently in the \nprocess of deciding how best to disengage itself from the project as part of its exit strategy from \nthe Northern Areas. Had attention to an exit route been paid right from the start, perhaps the \ndesign of the project would have augured better for its sustainability.  \n \n10.  Other initiatives of the SDC in the Northern Areas include an apricot oil extraction and \nmarketing business and green-wood furniture making. Both projects have been set up to spur \ninterest among the risk-averse local people by demonstrating to them the business potential of \nthese two sectors. Nonetheless, it is still too early to comment on the impact of these projects, \nas they were initiated very recently. \n \nC.  Enterprise Development Experience in Other Rural Areas \n \n11.  Traditionally, targeted and singularly focused efforts to safeguard the economic interests \nof the rural and peri-urban poor have been pursued by nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nand social development programs since they work directly with the poor to alleviate poverty. \nEven though poverty is a complex phenomenon with many causes and no single route to its \namelioration, most agencies accept the more non-controversial and generally held belief that \npoverty is about absence of economic opportunities and the capacity to avail oneself of those \nthat do exist. Hence, it is understandable when development organizations working with the \npoor design interventions that focus on economic aspects of poverty or when public initiatives \nfocus on the same. \n ", "Appendix 4          37 \n12.  Concerted programs for integrating the poor in mainstream commercial activities can be \nbroadly  categorized  into  financial  (in  Pakistan  the  focus  is  mainly  on  micro-credit)  and \nnonfinancial BDS, though nonfinancial services also frequently come packaged with micro-\ncredit. It is important to highlight the fact that while micro-credit operations and products can be \nstandardized  for  given  target  groups  and  geographic  locations,  nonfinancial  services  are \ndifferent, and standardizing them would be contrary to their objective of being demand-driven \nand responsive to market realities. This makes the design, implementation, and monitoring of \nnonfinancial service programs more challenging and demanding.  \n \n13.  While holistic social rural development through community group mobilization and the \nbuilding of self-help capacity has a rich and encouraging history in Pakistan, the record of \nnonfinancial  service  programs  to  enhance  income-earning  and  job  opportunities  for  the \nmarginalized  poor  is  mixed,  debatable,  and  not  as  clear  in  its  accomplishments.  Various \nprogrammatic designs have been tried, but plaguing nonfinancial service programs is a supply-\nled, direct-service-delivery, subsidies-oriented approach that is constrained in its outreach, not \nsustainable over the long run, cost-inefficient, and therefore also limited in impact and not \nreplicable. \n \n14.  Representative popular NGO models for delivering nonfinancial BDS to the poor and \nmarginalized communities in down-country Pakistan are discussed below. \n \n1.  Supporting  the  Production  and  Marketing  of  Handicrafts  and \nCircumventing the Problems Caused by the \u201cEvil Middle Man\u201d  \n \n15.  For  access  to  commercial  markets  for  their  products,  particularly  embroideries  and \nhandicrafts  produced  by  women,  communities  living  in  remote  areas  depend  on \nmiddlemen/women. The farther the distance from commercial markets, the higher the service \ncharge or commission of the agent. In addition, the more dispersed the producers, the less the \nlikelihood of their collectively associating to gain more negotiating leverage. Women\u2019s limited \nmobility in the rural areas is a major constraint on their active engagement in the commercial \narena. \n \n16.  In their efforts to circumvent the high commission charges to poor communities, some \nNGOs have set up working units or their own agents within the rural areas, which serve as \npoints where work is contracted out to women and where delivery of final products is taken. To \nfind good markets for women\u2019s handicrafts and embroideries, the NGOs also provide women \nwith design and product manufacturing assistance and access to raw materials. In this respect, \nthe NGO serves as a business contracting out work to piece-rate workers and selling it in the \nmarket. Though these initiatives address the design and marketing needs of the rural and peri-\nurban women, the NGOs do not function as  profitable, and hence sustainable, ventures as their \nbusiness  operations  are  heavily  subsidized  and  dependent  on  donor  grants,  with  limited \nprospects  of  attaining  financial  sustainability  in  the  future.  Thus,  their  activities  can  be \ncategorized as noble welfare activities but not as a business model that can be replicated. \nIllustrative  examples  are  the  Threadnet  Project  of  the  Karakorum  Area  Development \nOrganization, and Hawwa Associates and Sungi Foundation\u2019s women\u2019s hand-embroidery and \nhandicrafts outlets in Islamabad.  \n \n2.  Vocational Training for Employment \n \n17.  The  rural support  programs  (most  notably  the  National Rural  Support  Programme), \nthrough their affiliate capacity-building organizations, provide a range of vocational training \n ", "38          Appendix 4 \nprograms in the farm and nonfarm areas (in welding, cooking, tailoring, driving, auto-mechanic, \nstitching,  knitting,  and  other  skills)  to  improve  the  job  prospects  of  the  poor.  Community \norganizations within a given area identify the prospective trainees, and final selection is made \nby the rural support program through a rigorous process to determine the seriousness of the \npotential trainee and his/her economic status. Training is conducted through the vocational \ntraining institutes of the Government, whose service delivery capacity has been strengthened \nand training programs redesigned to meet market job requirements. Since the aim is to target \nthe poorest of the poor or the jobless, training is highly subsidized and only a token fee is \ncharged. For women, training is conducted within the community. Thousands of people in 79 out \nof Pakistan\u2019s 120 districts have been trained over the last few years. Through random sampling, \ntraining utilization is checked. Overall, it appears that this program is enabling people to get \nsemiskilled and skilled jobs.  \n \n3.  Private Business Subcontracting Model: Providing Embedded Services on \na Sustainable Basis \n \n18.  Perhaps the most viable mechanisms through which home-based and small businesses \nare acquiring BDS in a sustainable fashion are in the shape of embedded services (i.e., services \nthat come packaged with commercial transactions between businesses). For example, many \nprivate women-owned businesses have sprung up around areas where there is a prevalence of \nhand-embroidery skill\u2014almost across Pakistan\u2019s rural and selected peri-urban areas. Typically, \ndesign, purchase of raw materials, cutting and stitching, and the final sale of the garments are \ncentralized functions performed at the factory/premises of the entrepreneur. Poor women skilled \nin embroidery are contracted by the entrepreneurs on a piece-rate basis and provided designs, \nraw materials, and some coaching in new embroidery techniques and skills. The women either \ntake the work home and complete it as and when their home responsibilities permit, or work for \nfixed hours at the premises of the entrepreneur. By linking up with business-savvy private \nentrepreneurs,  rural  women  are  able  to  have  an  assured  income  and  markets  and  can \novercome limitations in market access, information about consumer preferences, and design. \n \n19.  Businesses  targeting  high-end  consumers  are  more  quality-conscious  and  therefore \nwilling to invest more in building the capacities of the small businesses that they subcontract to, \nso that the latter remain loyal to them and do not start supplying to competition, as is bound to \nhappen inevitably. A small business that has gained important technology, design, and market \naccess  by  working  with  larger  businesses  is  Millat  Tractors  Limited.  Millat  claims  to  have \ndeveloped the entire vehicle parts industry in Pakistan by working with home-based workshop \nowners  and  upgrading  their  capacities,  in  addition  to  working  with  large  parts  suppliers. \nLikewise, the income levels of the tobacco-leaf-growing farmers in the North-West Frontier \nProvince have improved substantially through their work with Pakistan Tobacco Limited and \nLakson Tobacco Limited.  \n \nD.  Selected International Experience \n \n20.  Several successful models of this approach in the region have had a major impact on \nthe rural economy. These include the \u201cOne Tambon\u2013One Product\u201d Program (OTOP) and the \nThai Business Initiative in Rural Development (TBIRD) Program (undertaken by an NGO) in \nThailand. The Government of Pakistan views the OTOP model as having the potential to be a \ncatalyst for rural modernization in Pakistan. Thailand also has its National Support Services \nProgram, which has been implemented for 4 years by the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural \nCooperatives (BAAC) with the European Union as the international partner. In the Philippines \nthe Growth with Equity in Mindanao Program has similarities in approach with the concept of \n ", "Appendix 4          39 \n\u201ceconomically  just  development,\u201d  which  has  attracted  the  interest  of  the  Government  of \nPakistan.  \n \n21.  OTOP has focused on various rural products including textiles, ceramics, handcrafted \npaper, fruits and vegetables, and leather goods. Design and technology assistance (for raw \nmaterials,  product  identification,  packaging,  transport,  and  finance)  is  supported  by  a \nsophisticated  market  information  system.  Partly  through  participation  in  product/trade  fairs, \nOTOP tries to connect craft manufacturers with a global market that rewards a high level of craft \nskill and encourages self-reliance and the human development of village folk. However, there \nare aspects of the OTOP program that are very specific to its origins and to Thailand. OTOP \nwas based on a program started in Oita Province in Japan. The purpose of this project was to \nimprove on locally available products and produce goods acceptable to the international market. \nThis  program  inspired  the  Thai  Government  to  adopt  a  similar  approach.  \u201cOne  Tambon \n(Village)\u201d was included in the title to emphasize the twin ideas of equality (the program is spread \nacross  the  village  economy)  and  comparative  advantage.  The  Japan  External  Trade \nOrganization  (JETRO)  launched  a  1-year  program  to  support  the  Thai  Government  from \nJanuary to December 2002. \n \n22.  From  an  institutional  point  of  view,  OTOP  involves  many  related  ministries  and \ndepartments of the Thai Government. It is important to understand that the system of local \ngovernment in Thailand is strong. Local government coverage is wide and a number of powers \nare decentralized especially to the province. Thailand has what is termed a \u201cCEO\u201d style of \nprovincial  government,  whereby  provincial  governors  are  encouraged  to  look  upon  their \nprovince as a business and to maximize its \u201cprofits.\u201d This approach to local government fits well \nwith  OTOP.  Given  this  structure,  there  has  been  no  need  to  develop  a  distinct  OTOP \ncorporation. \n \n23.  OTOP can draw on technical departments and on financial institutions for technical \nassistance. In the Thai context, local skill levels are often quite high (one reason why the \nprogram was able to select a \u201cOne Product\u201d approach is that the ethnic/cultural base of the Thai \nnormally allows for a high degree of specialization by a given community). OTOP has received \nconsiderable support from the financial sector. The support comes from such institutions as the \nVillage Fund, the People\u2019s Bank Program, and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development \nBank. The provision of micro-credit has been an exceptionally important aspect of OTOP. \n \n24.  Key to understanding the implementation of OTOP is the link between the program and \nJapan. JETRO saw that rural craft manufacturers in Thailand had already achieved a high \ndegree of skill and considerable product diversity. This had been encouraged for years, e.g., by \nthe Royal Project of His Majesty the King. There was already a base of skills and products that \nwould appeal to the Japanese consumer. \n \n25.  OTOP has therefore focused on the Japanese market (and to a degree on the tourists \nvisiting Thailand). JETRO provided the services of Japanese design experts and other technical \nassistance  to  upgrade  selected  products  specifically  for  Japan.  OTOP  emphasizes \nenvironmentally  friendly,  handmade,  and  high-quality  products,  which  are  not  necessarily \ncheap. In no sense is OTOP \u201cpoverty relief\u201d; it seeks to encourage people to aspire to a much \nhigher standard of living. \n \n26.  The country context of OTOP is quite different from that of Pakistan. OTOP built on the \ntradition of village specialization in products and the existing high level of skill. This situation is \nnot present in Pakistan. Secondly, in contrast to Pakistan, the local government system in \n ", "40          Appendix 4 \nThailand  is  well  developed  with  provincial  heads  managing  their  constituencies  with \nconsiderable entrepreneurial autonomy. Thirdly, and most important, OTOP started off with an \nedge in that there was a keen market for its products. Japanese investors were interested in \nwhat was being produced in Thailand and willing to invest in it. Lastly, OTOP is a government \ninitiative operated without cost to the enterprise. Other international experiences like the TBIRD \nproject in Thailand have more relevance for Pakistan. \n \nE.  Thailand Business Initiative in Rural Development  \n \n27.  On the premise that NGOs and villagers do not have the required business acumen, the \nTBIRD project aims to link the informal rural sectors and formal businesses. The Population and \nDevelopment Association, which started the project, leveraged its success in family planning \nand rural development to engage multinationals to \u201cadopt\u201d villages and develop sustainable \nbusiness projects. Companies sponsor TBIRD projects by contributing 5% of their director\u2019s \nfees and 5% of the director\u2019s bonus to a fund for rural development. Some companies provide \nmore. Other companies provide technical assistance, for instance by providing their workers \npaid leave to go to the project village and help directly in establishing a manufacturing line. The \nprogram has had considerable success working with the Bata shoe company. About 4 million \npairs of shoes are now made in northeastern Thai villages (the poorest part of the country). Nike \nand Dr Scholl are also involved in the program.  \n \nF.  National Support Services Program (NSSP), Thailand \n \n28.  NSSP began in 2001, in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 1997, and ended in \nFebruary  2005.  Its  objective  was  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  smaller  and  poorer  Thai \ncommunities to have a wider range of high-quality financial services. Another objective was to \noffer villagers support in dealing with people returning to the rural areas from the cities as a \nresult of the financial crisis. The project involved thousands of villagers and staff from BAAC, \nwhich  was  the  executing  agency.  There  were  two  main  components:  a  microfinance \ndevelopment program, and a community enterprise development program financed through a \nrevolving fund by the European Union for a total grant of \u20ac15 million.  \n \n29.  The project was able to reach 360 villages or community enterprise groups with 36,000 \nvillagers qualifying for training. Males and females were almost equally balanced in receiving \nsupport. Activities were concentrated in three provinces (Thailand has over 70 provinces), which \nwere considered pilot areas. NSSP developed a number of key tools designed to provide skills \nand  assist  in  creating  strong  and  disciplined  microfinance  intermediaries  and  community \nenterprise groups. These tools included aspects of accounting, management, and marketing \ndesigned to qualify the groups for credit from BAAC.  \n \n30.  Outreach has been a major factor in the success of the NSSP. BAAC has nationwide \ncoverage down to the subdistrict level, with representatives in almost every community. These \npersons also received training under the project while providing critical local knowledge to the \nproject staff at national level. An important lesson learned was that the project had to target \ngroups that had already started in business (not necessarily the poorest of the poor) and that \nhad an established network of community and business relationships. Social as well as physical \ncollateral was found to be an indicator of debt performance. \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 4          41 \nG.  Growth with Equity in Mindanao (GEM) Program, Philippines \n \n31.  The  GEM  Program  (supported  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment since 1996) aims to accelerate economic growth in Mindanao and help assure \nthat as many people as possible, including members of cultural and religious minorities, benefit \nfrom economic growth. The program provides limited financial support, on a cost-sharing basis, \nto  producer  groups  and  other  organizations.  It  works  with  producers\u2019  associations  and \ncooperatives,  NGOs,  the  Mindanao  Business  Council,  the  Autonomous  Region  of  Muslim \nMindanao (ARMM) Business Council, chambers of commerce, local governments, the ARMM \ngovernment,  national  government  line  agencies,  bilateral  and  multilateral  donor  agencies, \nprivate  firms,  and  other  organizations  and  individuals  working  to  bring  about  equitably \ndistributed  economic  growth.  GEM  also  has  political  objectives  (e.g.,  bringing  peace  to \nMindanao) that are outside the scope of the Asian Development Bank project. Nonetheless, \nGEM provides an excellent example of a successful rural modernization program. \n \n32.  The principal activities of GEM to promote growth are: (i) business support organization \ndevelopment,  (ii)  targeted  commodity  expansion,  and  (iii)  community  and  mid-scale \ninfrastructure  programs.  The  targeted  commodity  expansion  program  aims  to  introduce  or \nsignificantly expand the production and marketing of lucrative, nontraditional commodities in \nconflict-affected areas of Mindanao; help assure that all elements of the cold chain and \u201ccool \nchain\u201d  are  in  place  for  expanded  vegetable  and  fruit  shipment  to  markets  throughout  the \nPhilippines and the Asian region; and help expand exports of fish, fruit, and vegetables to \nexternal markets (especially the People\u2019s Republic of China). \n \nH.  Charoen Pokphand \n \n33.  Technology  transfer  can  also  be  achieved  by  the  private  sector  through  contract \nproduction.  A  well-known  example  of  technology  and  business  links  between  large-scale \nagribusiness and small farmers was pioneered in Thailand by Charoen Pokphand (CP), a \ncompany that later became a large conglomerate, extending its reach to other Asian countries. \nCP brought in a poultry hybrid and set up a large automated feed mill, which remains the core of \nits operations. The arrangements between the farmers and CP range from a guaranteed price \ncontract to a guaranteed wage contract. The sheds in which the chickens are raised are owned \nand operated by the farmers, although their construction may be financed with loans from the \ncontracting company. With a guaranteed price contract, prices of inputs and output are fixed in \nadvance, with the firm bearing all the price risk, while farmers bear the production risk. CP\u2019s \nextension  services  are  remarkable  in  intensity  and  quality.  The  company\u2019s  extension  staff \nmakes regular visits to provide technical information, check the animals\u2019 health, and ensure that \nthe farmers follow the company\u2019s regulations. Many farmers graduate to fully independent \nstatus as contractors, although links to CP are usually maintained through purchase of the \ncompany\u2019s feed. Poultry raising in Thailand has grown within two decades into a major export \nindustry. \n \n34.  Private contract farming could be extended to nonfarm rural enterprises, but may have \nonly a limited role to play. Where contract farming has been most successful, there is usually a \nrelatively rigid package of technical inputs and a high ratio of purchased inputs in total costs. In \naddition, because of economies of scale, companies like CP tend to work with the larger farms \nand  to  push  small  farmers  into  undertaking  larger  operations.  The  main  lesson  that  it \ndemonstrates is that a very input-intensive agriculture such as poultry raising also requires very \nintensive input from a labor force that is suitably educated (in this case, the extension staff of \nthe contracting company and, over time, the contract farmers with their newly acquired skills).   \n ", "42          Appendix 4 \nI.   Narai Technologies, Thailand \n \n35.  At the other end of the investment scale from CP, Narai Technologies Co. Ltd. (NT) was \nestablished  in  Thailand  in  1993  with  the  aim  of  identifying,  developing,  and  transferring \nagricultural technologies from more developed countries to less developed countries where the \nmarket opportunities were great. Its investments included manufacturing cotton machinery, teak \ntree development, and food systems engineering. Following a survey and an understanding of \nthe value chain in fish faming from supply of seed fish (fingerlings) to demand for specific \nspecies  (in  this  case,  tilapia),  NT  selected  the  Asian  Institute  of  Technology  (AIT)  as  a \ntechnology partner. A commercial partnership was formed to establish a commercial tilapia fry \nhatchery registered in 1993 as Nam Sai Farms (NSF). NSF ownership was 70% Thai and 30% \nNT.2 Total start-up investment was approximately $150,000, spent on ponds and a hatchery. \nNSF began to produce eggs regularly from its own brood stock in May 1995, but 1996 was the \nfirst year of full production, with a total sales output of 3.2 million fry/month (significantly higher \nthan ever achieved in Southeast Asia). Progress was often slow because of growing conditions \nand issues related to water quality, but by 1999 Nam Sai Farm produced an astounding 80 \nmillion  fry.  At  this  level  of  production  (6.7  million  fry/month),  NSF  earned  revenues  of \napproximately $17,500 per month. The company employed 80 full-time staff (two thirds female) \nand was the largest single employer in the local village (a place of some 400 households \napproximately 200 km from Bangkok). In 2000, NT sold the business at a profit and transferred \nownership  to  the  Thai shareholders.  The  business  remains  extremely  successful  and is  a \nclassic model of high-tech transfer leading to significant rural employment. \n                                                 \n2  AIT as an academic institution could not participate directly in the business. However, Narai Tech agreed to pay a \nroyalty to AIT based on production of fry. The royalty agreement was canceled by mutual agreement in 1999. \n ", "Appendix 5          43 \nPROPOSED ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE \nOF THE RURAL ENTERPRISE MODERNIZATION CELL \n \nSteering Committee \n \nMoIPSI \nChief Executive Officer/Senior \nMarket Development \nSpecialist/Team Leader  Chief Executive \nOfficer, SMEDA\nProduct  Knowledge Management  Outreach/ \nDevelopment/Market Support Team  Institutional \ning/Sector  Development/\nSpecilaists  Training \nPool of subject \nmatter specialists \nProvincial Institutions  Finance, \n(rural market  Knowledge Mgmt \nAdministration  \neconomist; capacity- System team: \nbuilding specialist;  KMS Coord., IM \npoverty, gender, and  Specialist, IT \nresettlement  Specialist,   District-Level Institutions \nspecialists, etc.)  Web Master, etc.\n \n \n  Sub Sector \nDevelopment Team \nCluster Development Managers  \n  Finance, Accounts, and \nCluster Development Officers  Administration Officers \nRural-based business \ndevelopment service \nnetworks \n \nIM = information management, IT = information technology, KMS = Knowledge Management System, MoIPSI = Ministry \nof Industries, Production, and Special Initiatives, SMEDA = Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority. \n ", " \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n  4\n4\nTable 6.1: Project Cost Summary, by Componenta    \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \nA\np\nGovernment of Asian Development Local p\ne\nPakistan Bank Total For.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \nThe rural sector of Pakistan plays a critical role in the economic development of the country. Poverty in Pakistan has a \nsignificant rural dimension. The number of poor people1 in Pakistan rose sharply in rural areas during the 1990s from \n22.1% of the population in 1990 to 35.2% in 1999. By the end of the 1990s the number had increased from 25.2% to \n33% in Punjab, from 24.1% to 26.6% in Sindh, and from 35.5% to 42.6% in the North-West Frontier Province (only in \nBalochistan was there a substantial decline from 38.4% to 22.8%).2 Understanding intraregional poverty is also very \nimportant (e.g., in Northern Punjab the incidence of poverty is 29.5% whereas in Central Punjab it is 34.8% and in \nSouthern Punjab it is 39.7%).  \n \nA very important characteristic of rural poverty in Pakistan is that upward of 40% of the labor force depends entirely on \nnonfarm activities. In the 1990s the growth of nonfarm activities was severely affected by low economic growth, a \ndecline in public sector spending, and lower worker remittances from the Middle East due to the scaling down of the \nconstruction boom. \n \nTraditional rural development programs are most unlikely to improve the livelihoods of this group of nonagricultural \nlaborers domiciled in the rural areas. It is to this group of people, which includes some of the poorest and most \nvulnerable groups, that the Project is targeted. The emphasis in the Project is one of rural modernization, not rural \ndevelopment. It takes a different approach: the identification of new technologies and ideas (e.g., for design and \nmarketing) and their transfer to rural communities to facilitate institutional processes required to support the transfer of \ncompetitive approaches to industrial and market activities. The focus is on fostering rural businesses and associations \nand transferring modern commercial practices, together with a strong emphasis on human and management (\u201csoft \nasset\u201d) development. It is based on a trajectory of development that has facilitated economic and social development \nin other developing member countries, especially the countries of East and Southeast Asia. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nEconomic determinants of poverty include decline in public sector investment and fiscal policy, limited participation of \nwomen in the remunerated labor force, inflation, and lack of access to markets and services in the rural areas. Social \ndeterminants include the highly unequal distribution of land; the hierarchical, almost semifeudal, structure of parts of \nrural society; the low levels of human development; and gender inequalities.  \nThe Government of Pakistan has facilitated a wide range of responses to poverty including governance reforms, \nongoing public works programs, a microfinance program, and a variety of social protection programs. The Project has \na focus on micro- and small enterprises (MSEs), one of the four sectors identified in the Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper for reducing poverty in Pakistan. Civil society groups including nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and the \nprivate sector are also involved in a range of activities to alleviate or reduce poverty. \n \n                                                 \n1  The Planning Commission of the Government of Pakistan has decided that the official poverty line for Pakistan will \nbe pegged at 2,350 calories per day. This is based on an adult equivalent intake of 2,150 calories in the urban \nareas and 2,450 calories in the rural areas. The poverty line for Pakistan per month in 2005 is PRs832 per capita. \n2  Asian Development Bank. 2002. Poverty in Pakistan \u2013 Issues, Causes, and Institutional Responses.

Participation Process \nThe government ministry with major responsibility for this Project is the Ministry of Industries, Production, and Special \nInitiatives. Its specialized agency Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority will be directly responsible for \ninitiating the Project and over time will devolve responsibility to a new agency, a not-for-profit company. This institution \nwill determine processes to support outreach mechanisms and develop partnerships with rural support programs and \nNGOs with extensive networks in rural areas.   \n \nPoor and vulnerable groups, including, most importantly, women, will be afforded the opportunity to fully participate in \nthe Project as several of the pilot projects will be targeted at women. Since the Project is premised on establishing \nsuccessful and profitable linkages with the market sector, remote areas are not likely to receive immediate attention \nduring the initial implementation phase of the technical assistance (TA) loan. Once successful models of partnerships \nand institutional processes are developed, interventions will be planned on an extensive scale in a variety of rural \nlocations.  The  participation  strategies  for  each  cluster  and  subsector  will  be  designed  during  implementation. \nHowever, the guiding principle will be to develop local capacity. These will include fostering business development \nservice (BDS) networks in unions and subdistricts, identifying and strengthening enterprise support services through \nlocally based partner organizations, and anchoring the process, where the BDS networks will be set in place and \nenterprise support service organizations become visible.  \n \nThe Project will actively support grassroots enterprise experience. At the rural level there are sizable numbers of \nenterprise trainers, both men and women, who have been trained and are running local NGOs or businesses in \nvillages and other rural locations. It will therefore be essential to tap into these available resources, and then initiate \nplans to strengthen and organize them. Furthermore, in clusters to be identified under the Project, preference will be \ngiven to areas that have these resources, particularly women trainers and business managers. Specific initiatives will \nthen be designed to support proposals from enterprise service providers that can demonstrate outreach to women and \nmarginalized groups associated with MSEs. A range of other activities will be supported, including mobilization of craft \nproducers, facilitation of craft bazaars, product development and diversification, design and packaging, and linkages \nwith credit and leasing facilities. Experiences gained in different regions on minimizing child labor and creating \nvocational opportunities for such children associated with enterprise labor will also be analyzed to ensure that \nclusters/subsectors selected continue to demonstrate progress in enhanced social awareness and fair trade practices.   \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \nThe design of the Project takes into account the fact that this is not a rural development project per se but rather one \nthat  builds  the  enabling  environment  for  rural  modernization  to  take  place  in  Pakistan  that  focuses  on \ncommercialization and nonfarm-based activities. The Project will design a range of business development services \nthat take into account the different sociocultural contexts of women in rural Pakistan society to ensure that the \nbusiness models developed are applicable to women from all rural social strata. A range of interventions are \nproposed. These include support for craft bazaars, practical training in the management of microenterprises, a \nprogram  of  outreach  to  rural  women  through  locally  based  business  development  service  providers,  female \nmembership in the enterprise development teams, consultations with the representatives of women associations and \nchambers, and representation of women in the steering committee and the board of Rural Enterprise Modernization \nCompany upon its establishment.   Additionally, participation in training and study tours, the leveraging of other \nprojects, gender-disaggregated monitoring and evaluation, and gender and development consultancy support are all \npart of the Project.   \n \nIn subsectors and clusters to be identified under the Project, preference will be given to areas that have these \nresources,  particularly  women  trainers  and  business  managers,  to  expand  outreach  and  access  to  women \nentrepreneurs and to women seeking to become entrepreneurs. Emerging evidence suggests that an increasing \nnumber of women, especially younger women, are interested in becoming entrepreneurs rather than simply waiting for \nand expecting nonexistent or poorly targeted government welfare measures. Specific initiatives will then be designed \nvia a range of participatory tools and techniques that take into account local women\u2019s livelihood demands to support \nenterprise service providers that can demonstrate outreach to women and marginalized groups associated with micro- \nand small enterprises. A range of capacity-building interventions, specifically tailored training, and linkages with \nmarkets and financial institutions will be supported. Experiences that have been gained in  different regions  in \nminimizing child labor and creating vocational opportunities for such children associated with enterprise labor will also \nbe analyzed to ensure that clusters/subsectors selected continue to demonstrate progress in enhanced social \nawareness, fair trade practices, and sensitivity to gender concerns.  \n \nTo ensure adequate focus on social and gender issues, the Project Performance Monitoring System will be developed \nto include indicators and evaluate aspects such as good practices associated with the design of pilot projects ranging \nfrom the extent of community (men and women) participation to the development of demand-driven interventions. \n ", "Appendix 10          57 \nSocial and gender indicators that are important include assessments as to the changes in working time and daily \nworkload\u2014ideally over the preceding 4\u20136 months to capture seasonality\u2014of women and the changes in the quality of \ntheir lives and capacity to cope with these changes. In certain cases, involvement in activities associated with the pilot \nprojects is likely to increase the working time and daily workload of women and girls. However, women and girls are \nlikely to accept an increase in workload if they realize that the benefits exceed the costs of being actively involved in \nthe pilot development of MSEs. The important point in relation to girls is whether such involvement would see them \nopting out of attending school on a regular basis. If the pilot projects are to contribute to the mitigation of bonded child \nlabor, it will be necessary to monitor and evaluate to what extent this actually occurs. The Project should appoint an \nindependent agency such as an NGO or similar organization well versed in all aspects of bonded child labor in \nPakistan to undertake monitoring and evaluation activities related to this sensitive issue. The NGO could work with \nhouseholds that participate in such practices, appropriate social welfare agencies, and employers or workshops that, \nin the course of pilot project development, have devised an exit strategy to end bonded labor practices.    \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?
