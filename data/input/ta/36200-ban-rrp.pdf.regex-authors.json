An environmental management system framework \nAssessment  was prepared (Appendix 4). \n   \nProject Description  The Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Project is \naimed at accelerating the development of small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs), especially SMEs in rural and nonurban areas, \nby improving their access to medium- and long-term credit.  \n   \nRationale  The major development challenge in Bangladesh is a sharp east\u2013\nwest  regional  divide  in  terms  of  employment  and  economic \ngrowth.  The  contrast  in  the  incidence  of  poverty  between  the \neastern and western parts of the country is significant\u2014with a \nheadcount  ratio  of  32%\u201334%  in  the  eastern  part  (comprising \nDhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet divisions) versus 47%\u201352% in the \nwestern part (comprising Barisal, Khulna, and Rajshahi divisions). \nThis  disparity  has  emerged  as  a  key  public  policy  concern. \nUnemployment and underemployment in the western part are also \nmuch higher than in the eastern part. The Government\u2019s policy \npriority  is  to  foster  economic  development  in  nonmetropolitan \nand/or rural and nonurban areas (i.e., outside the metropolitan \nareas of Dhaka and Chittagong) to address regional inequalities.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  development  agenda  for  nonmetropolitan \nand/or rural and nonurban areas recognizes the private sector as \nthe engine for growth and employment. Nonmetropolitan SMEs \ncomprise  60%\u201365%  of  the  country\u2019s  1.5  million  SMEs  and \naccount for most of the private sector in rural and nonurban areas. \nNonmetropolitan SMEs are a key driver to reduce poverty in the \ncountry since these SMEs are responsible for generating rural \nnonfarm activities\u2014the source of more than 50% of employment \nand income for the rural population. \n \nAn investment climate assessment conducted by the World Bank \nin  October  2008  indicates  that  access  to  credit  (particularly \nmedium- to long-term credit) remains a key constraint for SMEs. \nLack of credit access is more marked in nonmetropolitan areas. \nAs a result, nonmetropolitan SMEs are unable to realize their full \npotential to grow and generate employment.  ", "ii  \nThere are indications that the global financial crisis is beginning to \nimpact the economy. The recession in developed markets and the \neconomic slowdown in the Middle East are beginning to threaten \nBangladeshi exports and remittances which can have a significant \nimpact on unemployment in the economy. In the context of the \nprojected economic slowdown from the global financial crisis, the \nGovernment has sought Asian Development Bank (ADB) support \nfor  a  key  stimulus  measure\u2014enhanced  access  to  finance  to \nenable SMEs to operate at full potential.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  proposed  Project  will  be  contribution  to \ncontinuing  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  through \ndevelopment and growth of the SME sector. A vibrant SME sector \nis critical for investment, growth, and employment creation in the \ncontext  of  the  projected  economic  slowdown.  The  Project\u2019s \nspecific  and  immediate  expected  outcome  will  be  enhanced \ngrowth  in  the  number  and  size  of  commercially  viable  SMEs, \nespecially SMEs in rural and nonurban areas with emphasis on \nwomen-led SMEs, as well as increased employment in the SME \nsector.   \n   \nComponent   The Project comprises a credit facility for enhancing access to \nmedium-  to  long-term  financing  through  participating  financial \ninstitutions  (PFIs)  to  eligible  SMEs  located  outside  the \nmetropolitan areas of Dhaka and Chittagong. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The  Project\u2019s  estimated  investment  cost  is  $126.67  million \nequivalent, with ADB contributing 60%. \n \nFinancing Plan  Project Financing Plan \n \n($ million) \nSource  Total        % \nADB  76.00  }  \nGovernment (Bangladesh Bank)  19.00  75.00 \nPFIs  19.00    15.00 \nSMEs  12.67    10.00 \nTotal      126.67    100.00 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PFI = participating financial institution, \nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nFinancing  will  include  a  loan  of  SDR48,927,000  ($76  million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge \nof 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. It will include such other terms and conditions as may \nbe set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance will make the ADB \nTerms  loan available to Bangladesh Bank. Bangladesh Bank will relend ", "  iii   \nto  PFIs  in  local  currency  at  the  Bangladesh  Bank  rate.  The \nGovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk. PFIs will onlend \nthe  funds  to  eligible  SMEs  outside  Dhaka  and  Chittagong \nmetropolitan areas. The PFIs will onlend at interest rates reflecting \ntheir costs of funds plus a spread that covers transaction costs \nand  risk-adjusted  returns.  Since  the  Project\u2019s  credit  facility  is \naimed  at  improving  access  to  credit  by  SMEs,  it  is  deemed \nappropriate to make the ADB loan available to as wide a number \nof eligible financial institutions as possible. The PFI loans are to \nbe disbursed over 3 years, subject to a midterm review after 18 \nmonths to evaluate disbursement progress. Another review will be \nundertaken at the end of 3 years. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 March 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2012 \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance \n   \nImplementation  The implementing agency will be Bangladesh Bank. The Project\u2019s \nArrangements  credit  facility  will  be  administered  by  the  well-qualified  and \nexperienced  professionals  in  Bangladesh  Bank\u2019s  Agricultural \nCredit  and  Special  Programs  Department  that  have  effectively \nmanaged the credit assistance loan under ADB\u2019s ongoing SME \nSector Development Program.   \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under ADB-financed subloans will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time), as these relate to financial intermediary loans. Eligible \nsubborrowers  will  be  required  to  undertake  procurement  in \naccordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial \npractices that are acceptable to ADB. \n   \nProject Benefits and  There  are  significant  benefits  in  pursuing  private-sector-led \nBeneficiaries  regional SME development. The Project\u2019s main benefits are (i) an \nSME-driven  increase  in  rural  and  nonurban  employment  and \noutput; (ii) enhanced business opportunities for SMEs and PFIs \nthrough improved access to credit; (iii) catalyzing the enhanced \ncapabilities of PFIs and their SME credit staff in SME financing \noperations  as  well  as  in  risk  mitigation,  project  appraisal, \nsupervision, credit, and portfolio administration for small loans; \n(iv) expanded SME portfolios of PFIs; (v) enhanced empowerment \nof women entrepreneurs by ensuring access to enterprise finance; \nand  (vi)  improved  operational  governance  of  PFIs  as  well  as \ntransaction-based  accountability  for  corporate  governance  and \nanti-money laundering through the Project\u2019s eligibility criteria for \ndisbursements to PFIs. Since the development partners, except \nADB  and  the  World  Bank,  are  engaged  solely  in  technical \nassistance  (TA)  grant  support  for  SMEs  in  Bangladesh,  the \nProject  will  yield  synergistic  effects  for  SME  development  in \n ", "iv  \nBangladesh by complementing and supporting the development \npartners\u2019  extensive  TA  activities  (nationwide  TA  coverage  and \nencompassing  all  SME  subsectors).  From  2009  to  2012,  the \nProject is expected to generate an 8% increase in SME sector \nemployment as well as an 8% increase in the number of SMEs \nestablished  throughout  the  country\u2014primarily  in  rural  and \nnonurban areas. Employment generation through the Project will \nhelp reduce the relatively high incidence of poverty outside the \nmetropolitan areas of Dhaka and Chittagong.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Achieving the expected benefits and impacts depends on several \nassumptions  that  are  subject  to  varying  degrees  of  risks. \nMitigation measures are being put in place where feasible.  \n \nSME viability. The creditworthiness of SMEs in some locations \ncould  affect  utilization  of  the  Project\u2019s  credit  facility.  ADB\u2019s \nassessment indicates that PFIs have significant opportunities for \nlending to viable SMEs outside the metropolitan areas of Dhaka \nand Chittagong. To enhance SME viability, the Government has \nprovided  greater  tax  incentives  for  SMEs  located  outside  the \nmetropolitan areas than those located in metropolitan areas. \n    \nDelinquency. Delinquency risks that PFIs face in expanding their \nSME  portfolios  outside  the  metropolitan  areas  of  Dhaka  and \nChittagong are mitigated through (i) improved access to credit \ninformation;  (ii)  risk-based  pricing;  (iii)  Bangladesh  Bank \nmonitoring; and (iv) setting up dedicated SME units staffed with \ncapable personnel, efficient systems, and proper procedures. \n  \nPrivate  sector  perception.  Private  investors\u2019  perceptions  are \ncritical for the flow of investment in SMEs outside the metropolitan \nareas of Dhaka and Chittagong. Measures under the Project to \nsustain investor confidence include PFIs\u2019 commitments up front to \nprovide credit to viable SMEs. For its part, the Government has \ngiven priority to reducing regional inequalities by facilitating public \ninfrastructure development, particularly in nonmetropolitan areas. \nThe enabling environment for SMEs is also being enhanced. \n \nImplementation.  While  the  demand  for  SME  credit  is  robust, \nthere could still be implementation delays in case the eligible PFIs \nrefocus their priorities and/or fail to sustain expected performance \nstandards. These risks have been dealt with by assessing PFI \neligibility  and  commitment  up  front.  In  addition,  the  Project \nenables removal of PFIs in case of performance shortcomings.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  To  enhance  the  sustainability  of  the  Project,  a  TA  subproject  \ngrant support amounting to $500,000 has been approved through \nregional TA 6337 (Development Partnership Program for South \nAsia), funded under the Australia\u2013ADB South Asia Development \nPartnership Facility, to be administered by ADB. The impact of the \nTA subproject will be the development of women\u2019s micro, small, ", "  v   \nand  medium-sized  entrepreneurship  in  the  project  area.  The \noutcome will be the enhanced capacity of women entrepreneurs \nand  associations  to  fully  access  the  financial  resources  and \nservices earmarked for women-led SMEs under the Project. More \nspecifically, the TA subproject will (i) help assess constraints and \nopportunities  to  women  entrepreneurs'  effective  access  to \nfinancial resources made available under the loan; (ii) support the \nfinancial  and  legal  literacy  of  women  entrepreneurs  and \nassociations;  (iii)  enhance  women  entrepreneurs\u2019  capacity, \nproductivity, and competitiveness; (iv) promote networking among \nwomen  entrepreneurs\u2019  associations;  and  (v)  develop  a  sex-\ndisaggregated  database  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the \nsocial  and  gender  equality  results.  The  TA  subproject  will  be \nimplemented in selected districts identified at project onset based \non  a  set  of  agreed  criteria,  outside  the  metropolitan  areas  of \nDhaka  and  Chittagong.  The  TA  subproject  outcomes  will  be \nmonitored by the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance and \nADB  through  consultants\u2019  reports,  periodic  consultations  and \nreview missions. \n \nAn  ongoing  TA  to  support  ADB's  SME  Sector  Development \nProgram in Bangladesh has been extended till June 2010. The \nscope of the targeted SME capacity building component under \nthis  TA  is  being  enlarged  to  enhance  capacity  of  PFIs  to \nundertake  financial  analysis  of  SMEs,  particularly  in  rural  and \nnonurban areas. \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development \nProject. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Macroeconomic context. Bangladesh\u2019s economy has exhibited resilience in the face of \nthe global economic downturn. Despite the global recession, especially in countries to which it \nexports both goods and migrant workers, Bangladesh maintained gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth of 5.5% in FY2009. Per capita income is $690 in FY2009\u2014up from $608 in FY2008. \nHowever, there are indications that the global financial crisis is beginning to affect the economy. \nThe recession in developed markets and the economic slowdown in the Middle East are beginning \nto threaten Bangladesh exports and remittances.  \n \n(i)  Exports. Overall export growth has been volatile and slowed considerably to a \nmonthly decline of 4.6% by March 2009. Exports of ready-made garments, while still \ngrowing, have fallen significantly from 59% at the beginning of FY2009 to 19% in \nFebruary 2009. Ready-made garment export orders have declined since December \n2008, and this will have a lagged impact on exports. Prices of ready-made garment \nexports are being renegotiated downward in some cases, while in others, buyers are \nrequesting an extension of shipment dates. The performance of the ready-made \ngarment sector is crucial because it accounts for over three-quarters of export \nearnings and contributes about 12% of GDP. It also accounts for about 40% of \nmanufacturing output and employment, and supports many ancillary industries. The \nglobal economic downturn is also exerting significant downward pressure on both \nthe demand and price of a number of Bangladesh\u2019s other exports\u2014such as jute, \nleather, pharmaceutical exports, and frozen food items. World Bank calculations, \nbased on the latest census surveys on the quarterly real GDP growth outlook, \nsuggest that Bangladesh\u2019s export markets will contract in 2009.   \n \n(ii)  Remittances. Remittances have been a key driver of economic growth and poverty \nreduction in Bangladesh, so the impact of the global financial crisis on remittances is \nof  critical  importance.  Remittances  have  held  up  so  far  but  growth  rates  are \ndeclining rapidly. Monthly remittance growth slowed from 44.7% in July 2008 to \n7.6% in April 2009\u2014the lowest so far this fiscal year. The bulk of Bangladesh\u2019s \nremittances (about 63%) come from the Middle East, which hosts over 3.6 million \nBangladeshi workers. The lackluster performance of many Gulf Cooperation Council \ncountries is adversely affecting work opportunities for migrants from Bangladesh, \nand therefore future remittances. Meanwhile, there are reports of visas to workers \nbeing cancelled and some migrants returning to Bangladesh.  \n \n(iii)  Job losses. The current labor force is estimated at around 50 million. There could \nbe a significant impact on unemployment in an economy where 2 million people \nenter the labor force every year if the export industries continue to lay off workers. In \nthe immediate future, the domestic economy may need to create about 2.0 million\u2013\n2.5 million new jobs to keep unemployment under control. While the impact of the \nglobal financial crisis on employment in the ready-made garment sector (3.1 million \nemployed) is expected, the textile and jute sectors have already started to suffer. In \nthe textile sector, 12 out of 341 spinning mills are reported to have shut down and \nmost of the mills have reduced their operation by about 30%. Reduction in yarn ", "2  \nexport has led most of the jute enterprises to reduce production levels by 25%\u201330% \nand to lay off 10,000\u201320,000 workers during July\u2013December 2008. According to the \nBangladesh Jute Spinners Association, job losses in the jute sector may reach \n50,000 by the end of FY2009.  \n \n(iv)  Government response in the context of the global financial crisis. In March \n2009, the Government formed a 27-member financial crisis task force headed by the \nfinance minister and comprising the country\u2019s foremost economists, top bureaucrats, \nand representatives from the private sector, civil society, and political parties. The \ntask  force  is  mandated  to  monitor  impacts  of  the  global  financial  crisis  and \nrecommend  stimulus  measures  to  address  the  crisis  by  focusing  on  growth-\npromoting activities that include support to small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs). To enhance liquidity and stimulate lending, the central bank\u2014Bangladesh \nBank\u2014cut the repo and reverse repo rate by 25 basis points in March 2009. The \nlending limits of the four state-owned commercial banks were also doubled (from \n5% to 10%) in March 2009 to boost domestic investment. State-owned commercial \nbanks\u2019 capacity to provide loans to a single borrower was also raised. In April 2009, \nthe Government announced a stimulus package for Tk50 billion to boost business \nconfidence, shore up social safety nets, and support key sectors of the economy. A \nmore comprehensive stimulus package was announced in the FY2010 budget, with \nspecific budget allocation to address these challenges.  \n \n3.  Development challenge. Although Bangladesh has a small land area and a relatively \nhomogeneous population, economic development has not advanced at the same rate in all the \nregions of the country. Sharp east\u2013west regional differences in the incidence of poverty and per \ncapita income are a major development challenge, which may be exacerbated by the global \nfinancial crisis. The contrast in the incidence of poverty between the eastern and western parts of \nthe country is significant\u2014with a headcount ratio of 32%\u201334% in the eastern part (comprising \nDhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet divisions)1 and 47%\u201352% in the western part (comprising Barisal, \nKhulna, and Rajshahi divisions). This regional disparity has recently emerged as a key public \npolicy concern.2 The incidence of poverty at the national level was estimated at 40% in 2005. \nEstimates based on the household income and expenditure survey 2000 and 2005 also indicate \nthat the average real per capita income in the metropolitan areas of Dhaka and Chittagong is about \n40% higher than in other metropolitan areas.3  \n \n4.  Development paradigm. Expanded roles for foreign direct investment and public\u2013private \npartnerships are critical elements of the Government\u2019s development agenda. The narrowing fiscal \nspace is prompting growing reliance on the private sector for investments and service delivery. The \nGovernment is cognizant that a well-functioning SME sector could take the lead in generating jobs \nand economic growth while raising income levels for a large segment of the population. The \nmajority of firms outside of metropolitan areas are SMEs. Rural nonfarm activities\u2014the most \npromising force behind poverty reduction in the country, and the source of more than half of \nemployment and incomes for the rural population\u2014are fully reliant on those small enterprises. \nHowever, these enterprises have not realized their full potential for contributing to economic growth \n                                                 \n1  Bangladesh consists of six divisions\u2014Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Barisal, Khulna, and Rajshahi. Each division consists \nof numerous districts. For instance, Dhaka Division has seventeen districts (including Dhaka District) and Chittagong \nDivision has eleven districts (including Chittagong District). \n2  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2005. Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2005. Dhaka. \n3  Dhaka metropolitan area is defined as the Dhaka city corporation (population of about 6.7 million) and represents only \npart of Dhaka District. Chittagong metropolitan area is defined as the Chittagong city corporation (population of about \n3.0 million) and represents only part of Chittagong District. The urban section of Bangladesh comprises six city \ncorporations  (Dhaka,  Chittagong,  Sylhet,  Barisal,  Khulna,  and  Rajshahi),  which  are  collectively  referred  to  as \n\u201cmetropolitan areas\u201d in this report. \u201cNonmetropolitan areas\u201d comprise peri-urban areas around each of the six city \ncorporations; these are also known as sadder upazilas (small towns and villages). ", "    3    \nand employment generation. The Government recognizes the importance of SMEs in equitable \nregional  growth.  Accordingly,  regional  SME  development  is  one  of  the  key  elements  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy for reducing regional inequalities in its latest national development strategy, \nMoving Ahead: National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction II (FY2009\u20132011).4  \n \n5.  Small and medium-sized enterprises. There are nearly 1.5 million SMEs5 in Bangladesh, \n60%\u201365% of which are located outside the metropolitan areas of Dhaka and Chittagong. There is a \nvery high density of SMEs in the industrial economy of Bangladesh. SMEs constitute over 99% of \nprivate  industrial  establishments  and  provide  job  opportunities  to  about  70%\u201380%  of  the \nnonagricultural labor force. The SME share in manufacturing value added to GDP varies at 28%\u2013\n30%. The services sector is primarily composed of SMEs, which is responsible for the bulk of \nemployment growth.6 SME contribution to national exports is significant through different industries \nsuch as ready-made garments, jute, and leather (Appendix 2). SMEs are broadly segregated as \nfollows:  \n \n(i)  Small  informal  enterprises  typically  employ  5-9  persons  and  are  largely  family-\nbased. Having grown from microenterprises,7 they use significant portions of their \nbusiness revenues to invest in expansion. Typically, these enterprises lack access \nto formal credit and support services. \n(ii)  Small formal sector enterprises typically employ 10\u201350 persons and have well-\nestablished  relationships  with  larger  manufacturing  and  trading  concerns.  While \nsignificant  growth  potential  exists,  they  face  leadership  and  management \nchallenges. Sources of finance are usually retained earnings and supplier credits.  \n(iii)  Medium-sized enterprises typically employ 51\u2013150 persons and serve as a link \nbetween the formal and informal economies through well-established supplier and \nbuyer relationships with small formal and informal SMEs, as well as with large \ndomestic  and  international  corporate  entities.  Although  professionally  managed, \nthere is a need to maintain competitiveness. Access to finance remains constrained \neven for this category of SMEs.  \n \n6.  The  vision  and  strategies  for  SME  development  in  Bangladesh  explicitly  address  the \nconcerns of entrepreneurs in the SME sector within the national economic and social framework as \nset out in National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction II of the Planning Commission. \nFurthermore, in its final draft form, the Industrial Policy 2009 of the Ministry of Industries (MOI) \nclearly  states  that  SME  development  will  be  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  the  Government\u2019s \nindustrialization  strategy.  MOI  facilitates  measures  to  promote  development,  growth,  and \ninternational competitiveness in the SME sector as an integral part of the national economy. All \npolicy and programming initiatives for the SME sector are designed to be consistent with and \ncomplementary to the existing policy initiatives of other key ministries.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2008.

Small enterprises can employ up to 50 people and \nmedium-sized enterprises can employ 51\u2013150 people. A lower limit for small enterprises is not defined by Bangladesh \nBank circular but can be assumed to be five staff based on numerous SME statistical surveys conducted by \ndevelopment partners and the Government. In terms of the total value of assets, the definition classifies (i) small \nenterprises as those with fixed asset value (excluding land and buildings) of Tk0.05 million\u2013Tk15 million; and \n(ii) medium-sized  enterprises  as  those  with  fixed  asset  value  (excluding  land  and  buildings)  of  Tk15  million\u2013\nTk200 million.

Analysis of Key Problems \n \n7.  An investment climate assessment8 indicates that scarcity of certain resources (energy, \nfinance, land, and labor skills) has started to put a strain on Bangladesh\u2019s further growth and \nproductivity gains, as factor markets have not risen up to the challenge of efficiently reallocating \nresources to the highest productivity entities within the economy. Because of inefficient reallocation \nof resources, especially restricted access to finance to the productive and poverty-reducing SME \nsector, the Bangladesh economy curtails its own productivity growth, income growth, and poverty \nreduction. The majority of firms in nonmetropolitan areas of Bangladesh are SMEs. These are a \nkey driver to reduce poverty in the country since they are responsible for generating rural nonfarm \nactivities\u2014the source of more than 50% of employment and income for the rural population.   \n \na.  Access to Finance \n \n8.  Limited access to formal credit remains the strongest constraint on SMEs\u2019 growth prospects \nin terms of a large supply\u2013demand gap and scarce medium- and long-term credit.  \n \n(i)  Large supply\u2013demand gap for small and medium-sized enterprise credit. The \noverall supply\u2013demand gap for SME credit is estimated at Tk165 billion. The total \ndemand for SME lending is estimated at Tk255 billion9 while current supply for SME \ncredit (based on current SME loan principal outstanding) is estimated at Tk88.8 \nbillion (Appendix 2). The supply\u2013demand gap for SME credit is more pronounced for \nnonmetropolitan SMEs than metropolitan SMEs, which indicates that SME lending is \nconcentrated in metropolitan areas\u2014limiting the potential of rural and nonurban \ndevelopment. An estimated 50.8% of metropolitan firms had at least one loan from a \nfinancial institution. While 75% of nonmetropolitan firms report a need for financing, \nonly 6% availed of formal finance. In 2006-2008, 3% had borrowed from banks and \n3% from nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and microfinance institutions (MFIs). \nAccess to formal finance for larger nonmetropolitan enterprises (employing 10 or \nmore  workers)  is  comparable  to  that  of  smaller  metropolitan  firms,  with  32% \nreporting having a bank loan and 3% with NGO and MFI loans. Start-up SMEs find it \neven harder to borrow from banks10 and even SMEs that have access are able to \nborrow much less than their investment needs. As a result, firms need to use \ninternal savings to finance investment; internal sources fund 70% of firm investment \nin Bangladesh, as opposed to lower shares in other South Asian countries. Overall, \nthe SME credit situation for women entrepreneurs is more acute. \n(ii)  Scarce  medium-  and  long-term  credit. Because of the relatively small equity \nmarket  and  nascent  long-term  debt  market,  financial  institutions  like  banks  are \nunable  to  mobilize  adequate  medium-  and  long-term  funding  domestically. \nCommercial banks in Bangladesh are facing maturity mismatches in their asset and \nliability management as they rely on short-term deposits as their financial source. \nWith  the  absence  of  a  sovereign  rating,  Bangladesh  has  limited  access  to \ninternational  financial  markets.  Medium-  and  long-term  credit  is  scarcer  for \nnonmetropolitan enterprises than for metropolitan enterprises. In metropolitan areas, \n69% of lending has a maturity of less than 3 years. A little less than half of the loans \nhave maturities of 1 year. In nonmetropolitan areas, the average loan term for bank \n                                                 \n8  World Bank. 2008. Harnessing Competitiveness for Stronger Inclusive Growth: Bangladesh Second Investment \nClimate Assessment. Washington, DC. \n9  Ferrari, A. 2008. Increasing Access to Rural Finance in Bangladesh: The Forgotten \"Missing Middle.\" Washington, DC: \nWorld Bank.  \n10 Only 14% of working capital for small firms in Bangladesh is financed by bank loans compared with 30% for medium-\nsized firms. Only 11% of new SME investment in Bangladesh is financed through bank loans. ", "    5    \nloans was 17 months, and 75% of loans had a maturity of 1 year. More than a third \n(38%) of nonmetropolitan enterprises reported having access to supplier credit, but \nthis is also very short-term finance\u2014with 80% of firms reporting repayment periods \nof 3 weeks or less. As a result, medium- to long-term financing is typically procured \nthrough  accumulated  earnings,  and  this  leads  to  underinvestment  and  lower \nemployment and production growth for SMEs, especially nonmetropolitan SMEs. \n \nb.  Enabling Environment  \n \n9.  While  the  Government  has  successfully  taken  measures  for  enhancing  the  operating \nenvironment for SMEs, some weaknesses still need to be addressed. These include the following: \n \n(i)  Inadequate and unreliable credit information. The available information and track \nrecord of a potential SME borrower is limited, as credit rating agencies and credit \ninformation bureaus do not cover their operations. A credit information bureau is \noperated by the central bank (Bangladesh Bank) containing current loan information \nfor all borrowers of financial institutions regulated by Bangladesh Bank. The system \nis not computerized. It contains information about current loans above Tk50,000 (not \nthe full banking history of the borrower) and does not have a unique identifier for \nborrowers.  This  reduces  the  effectiveness  of  the  system,  particularly  affecting \nsmaller firms that cannot build up reputation-based credit. The resulting information \nasymmetry prevents banks from reasonably assessing SMEs\u2019 creditworthiness.  \n(ii)  Lack of a framework and system for securing movables. SME entrepreneurs \ntypically have little land to offer by way of collateral, but they have movable property \nranging from equipment to inventory to receivables. However, the absence of a legal \nand  regulatory  framework  to  allow  financial  institutions  to  secure  their  lending \nagainst such security is a constraint. Linked to this is the lack of a central registry to \nensure the integrity of such collaterals.  \n \nc.  Connectivity to Markets  \n \n10.  The majority of nonmetropolitan enterprises in Bangladesh sell their goods and services \ndirectly to consumers located within the same union and/or ward where they are located, which \nlargely limits the size of the markets for their products and services. Connectivity to markets, in \nterms of market linkages as well as technological and information exchange, is vital for the growth \nof  peri-urban,  small  town,  and  village  areas.  Low  demand  is  perceived  as  the  most  serious \nobstacle to doing business in nonmetropolitan areas, linked significantly to low access to larger \nmarkets.  Very  few  firms  have  ready  access  to  any  business  services  such  as  marketing, \naccounting, or technical support. As a result, SMEs, particularly in the nonmetropolitan areas, are \ndisadvantaged in terms of market-related know-how and capacity for market research as well as \nvocational training required for improved product quality. These enterprises face difficulties in \nupgrading technology and locating buyers for their products in larger markets.   \n \nd.  Physical Infrastructure Constraint \n \n11.  The quality of and access to infrastructure play an important role in the establishment, \noperation, and expansion of an enterprise. In addition to limited access to finance, Bangladeshi \nfirms have identified (i) inadequate and poor quality infrastructure (roads and energy supply), and \n(ii) difficulty in obtaining land (especially serviced land), as the primary hindrances for private sector \ncompetitiveness  (footnote  8).  These  hindrances  are  more  severe  for  nonmetropolitan  firms \ncompared with metropolitan firms. Serviced land is the single defining (or limiting) factor of new or \nexpanding entrepreneurs. Smaller firms are cut off more severely from access to land.  \n \n \n ", "6  \ne.  Disadvantaged Women Entrepreneurs \n \n12.  Women  entrepreneurs  are  less  educated  and  have  significantly  less  access  to  SME \nfinance.  The  rates  of  women  entrepreneurship  are  lower  among  rural  nonfarm  enterprises \ncompared with metropolitan firms. Nonmetropolitan enterprises owned by women are smaller, \nyounger, and more likely to be informal and home-based. Only 2% of these firms are registered, \ncompared with 42% for firms owned by men. \n \n2.  Analysis of Opportunities \n \n13.  Regional  economic  disparity  is  of  enormous  economic  and  political  significance  in \nBangladesh (para. 3). With the availability of medium- to long-term funds, there arises considerable \ninterest  among  financial  institutions  in  exploring  SME  financing  opportunities  beyond  the \nmetropolitan areas of Dhaka and Chittagong. This makes a business case for financial institutions \nto diversify and expand their portfolios in rural and nonurban areas outside the metropolitan areas \nof Dhaka and Chittagong. As critical as access to finance is, however, its development impact \ndepends on reform measures\u2014both financial and nonfinancial. \n \na.  Enhancing the Enabling Environment \n \n 14.  Credit information. The Government is facilitating the automation of the credit information \nbureau at Bangladesh Bank to ensure the availability of credit history for all SMEs through a \n16-month grant project funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) of the \nUnited  Kingdom  and  managed  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation\u2019s  (IFC\u2019s)  SouthAsia \nEnterprise  Development  Facility  (SEDF).  The  project  commenced  in  May  2009  and  will  be \ncompleted by September 2010. Furthermore, Dun & Bradstreet, a provider of business information \nfor risk management decisions, will commence operations in Bangladesh by December 2009 with \nthe specific task of assigning credit ratings to SMEs. These efforts will enable coverage of all SME \nborrowers and will help the banks to shift from purely collateral-based lending to cash-flow-based \nlending that emphasizes greater reliance on character, better understanding of the business, and \ncredit rating information at the outset of the credit relationship with SMEs.11 Credit information will \nalso facilitate adoption of credit scoring methods by lenders to reduce appraisal time and cost.  \n \n15.  Securing movables. The Government is pursuing enactment of a secured transactions bill \nto increase the availability of secured financing alternatives by enabling SMEs to use their movable \nproperty as collateral. Earlier Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) supported \nthis effort.12 The Ministry of Justice is vetting the final draft of the secured transactions bill and \nenactment is expected by December 2009.  \n \nb.  Improving Connectivity to Markets \n \n16.  Better market activity would strengthen technological, financial, and information exchange \nbetween larger and smaller companies, as well as urban and rural ones. The Government provides \nbusiness support and capacity development assistance as well as infrastructure facilities to SMEs, \nmainly through the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC). Founded in \n1957  by  legislation  as  the  principal  government  organization  mandated  to  promote  the \ndevelopment of countrywide small and cottage industries, BSCIC is responsible for (i) allotment of \n                                                 \n11 Support for cash-flow-based lending does not mean the elimination of collateral. The basis for credit in cash-flow-\nbased lending is not the collateral offered by the borrower but rather the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan (i.e., SMEs \ncan obtain credit on the strength of their creditworthiness). Less restrictive covenants can be utilized, such as \npari passu treatment for all creditors or the guarantee of the owners instead of requiring hard collateral. Having such a \nsystem in place could serve as an incentive for SMEs in the informal sector to move to the formal sector.      \n12 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance: Supporting Good Governance Initiatives in the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. \nManila (TA 4140-BAN). ", "    7    \ndeveloped industrial estates in 64 districts in Bangladesh; (ii) entrepreneurship training programs \nconducted  by  its  training  arm,  Small  and  Cottage  Industries  Training  Institute;  (iii) credit \narrangement and end-use supervision; (iv) design, development, and distribution of prototypes \nthrough its design center; (v) research and development activities; (vi) management and skills \ndevelopment; and (vii) market study and marketing assistance (e.g., trade fairs). To move BSCIC \ntoward  a  leaner  and  more  effective  organization,  the  Government  has  initiated  a  number  of \nrestructuring measures13 for BSCIC on policy, governance, strategic development, management \nstructure,  and  a  staffing  plan  based  on  recommendations  under  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  SME  Sector \nDevelopment Program (SMESDP).14 Furthermore, the product certification system of Bangladesh \nStandard Testing Institute was upgraded with the installation of modern equipment in 2008, which \nwill promote product certification among SMEs and facilitate access to export markets.15  \n \n17.  Under ADB\u2019s ongoing SMESDP, an SME web portal has been designed and developed at \nMOI\u2019s SME cell, which (i) disseminates information about SMEs in Bangladesh such that any local \nor foreign buyer or investor can easily reach the SMEs and initiate any business relationship; \n(ii) facilitates e-governance and provides online information for SMEs on government facilities and \nservices, such as requirements for business registration, licensing, and product certification; and \n(iii) contains a library of SME-related information, such as a list of business development services \nproviders and a link to the SME database. Furthermore, the SMESDP supported the establishment \nand operationalization of SME helpline outreach centers at district offices of BSCIC and facilities of \nthe Dhaka and Chittagong chambers of commerce and industry to provide advisory support to \nfacilitate SME access to government services, including registration and licensing. The outreach \ncenters will be linked to the SME web portal to facilitate their services to SMEs. IFC also provides a \ncomprehensive business development services website for Bangladesh to provide a one-stop shop \nfor local SMEs and service providers to access business resources, training, and information. One \nof the largest projects in the field of SME promotion in Bangladesh is KATALYST (Developing \nBusiness  Service  Markets), 16 which  is  funded  by  DFID,  Swiss  Development  Corporation, \nNetherlands Development Organisation, and Canadian International Development Agency. The \nassistance  of  KATALYST  aims  to  improve  market  access,  management  and  technical  skills, \nquality, and production methods. KATALYST identifies key constraints and opportunities in sectors \n(such  as  manufacturing,  agriculture,  and  services)  and  promotes  mechanisms  that  improve \nbusiness performance. Other development partners are also significantly involved in improving \nconnectivity to markets (paras. 32\u201333).  \n  \nc.  Enhancing Physical Infrastructure  \n \n18.  Physical  infrastructure  development  is  critical  for  meeting  SMEs\u2019  needs  for  power, \ntransport, water, and sanitation. The Government recognizes the importance of improving and \nexpanding physical infrastructure, particularly in nonmetropolitan areas, for sustaining economic \nand social development. The development of essential infrastructure17 to generate pro-poor growth \nis one of the key elements under the Government\u2019s National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty \nReduction  II.  The  Government  is  keen  to  enhance  the  private  sector\u2019s  role  in  providing \ninfrastructure services through public\u2013private partnerships. ADB provided a $165 million Public\u2013\n                                                 \n13 Based on recommendations made by the BSCIC restructuring committee constituted by MOI, a road map to BSCIC \nstrategic reorientation was prepared and submitted to ADB by MOI in May 2008. The road map is currently being \nimplemented.  \n14 ADB. 2004.

ADB\u2019s projects \ninclude construction of roads and transport infrastructure, development of the power and gas sector, and improvement \nin the efficiency of Chittagong Port.  \n ", "8  \nPrivate  Infrastructure  Development  Facility 18  to  promote  public\u2013private  partnerships  in \ninfrastructure  finance  and  catalyze  infrastructure  debt  financing  through  the  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Company Limited. This facility complements the World Bank\u2019s $50 million Investment \nPromotion and Finance Facility Project19 that supports private sector participation and provides \nlong-term finance for infrastructure projects. The Government is also seeking to leverage its own \nresources  by  fostering  innovative  ways  to  involve  private  partnerships  in  the  financing, \ndevelopment, management, and servicing of economic zones in nonmetropolitan areas through the \nWorld Bank\u2019s $150 million Private Sector Development Support Project.20 Economic zones address \nkey competitiveness issues facing firms (including SMEs) by providing serviced land, reliable \ninfrastructure, adequate logistics, and an authority that attends to the needs of the zone\u2019s tenants. \n \nd.  Financial Sector Reforms  \n \n19.  Ongoing  financial  sector  reforms  focus  on  (i)  greater  autonomy  for  Bangladesh  Bank, \n(ii) strengthening  Bangladesh  Bank\u2019s  capabilities  to  perform  its  enhanced  responsibilities,  (iii) \nstrengthening  prudential  regulations  and  supervision,21 (iv)  restructuring  the  management  and \ninternal processes of state-owned commercial banks and ultimately privatization, (v) strengthening \nthe legal and judicial processes,22 and (vi) improving the money and debt markets. These reforms \nhave been supported by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and ADB. \n \n20.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Financial  Institutions  Development  Project 23 has  enhanced  the \ngovernment debt market from a market with limited maturities and literally no secondary trading to \nan  active  market  with  regular  auctions  for  debt  with  maturities  up  to  10  years.  In  addition, \nsimplification of market regulations to facilitate bond and security issues and rules and procedures \nfor  bonds  and  debentures  were  also  developed  and  implemented.  The  World  Bank  is  also \nstrengthening the capacity of Bangladesh Bank24and is reforming some nationalized commercial \nbanks, leading to their privatization, under the Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization Project25\n \nand  the  Second  Development  Support  Credit  Project.26 Progress  on  key  reforms  has  been \nintegrated in the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Poverty Reduction Growth Facility. \n \n21.  The  ADB-financed  Capital  Market  Development  Program27 helped  enhance  the  market \n \ncapacity and develop a fair, transparent, and efficient domestic capital market to attract investment \ncapital for augmenting the capital resources of the banking system and improve efficiency in \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2008.

Through  ADB\u2019s  Good \nGovernance Program,29 ADB is enhancing investor confidence in the capital market as well as \nincreasing  the  nation\u2019s  competitiveness  and  attractiveness  for  foreign  direct  investments  by \nmitigating widespread corruption.  \n \n22.  While significant reforms and reform initiatives are under way, market gaps remain. The \nimpact of the ongoing reforms in the financial sector\u2014to address structural issues such as capital \nmarket development and availability to the private sector of alternative sources of medium- to long-\nterm funds\u2014will only be realized during the medium to long term. As a result, the significant gap in \nSME financing will persist in the short term. Addressing the prevailing market inadequacies while \nkeeping the SME development agenda moving forward are important for Bangladesh. \n \n3.  Government Policy Support for SME Development  \n23.  The Government\u2019s National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction II recognizes the \nprivate sector as the engine of economic growth. The promotion of pro-poor growth propelled by \nthe private sector is to be supported by macroeconomic and sector policies, including SME sector \ndevelopment. To achieve high growth rates, emphasis is on investments in infrastructure and a \nknowledge economy\u2014with a focus on rural and nonurban development. In its final draft form, \nMOI\u2019s new Industrial Policy, 2009, covers (i) the roles of MOI and other relevant agencies including \nBSCIC, the Board of Investments, and Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority, in promoting \nthe development of industries, particularly those with strong growth potential; (ii) promotion of \nexports and foreign direct investment; (iii) privatization of state-owned enterprises; and (iv) thrust \nsectors  (such  as  agro-based  industries,  handicrafts,  and  ready  made  garments)  and \nunderdeveloped areas. The Industrial Policy 2009 in its final draft form emphasizes that SME \ndevelopment will be an integral component of the Government\u2019s industrialization strategy. To bring \ndynamism to the SME sector, in terms of new entrants and growth of established enterprises, the \nIndustrial Policy states that a comprehensive approach to SME development will be pursued that \nemphasizes increasing investment in the SME sector and removing barriers to its growth through \nlegislative and regulatory reforms. Reforms entail fiscal incentives, access to finance, provision of \nland and site services, as well as technological and marketing support such as e-commerce and \nimproving supply chain management to foster subcontracting and linkages between SMEs and \nlarger enterprises. \n \n24.  The visions and strategies for SME promotion under the Industrial Policy and National \nStrategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction II were derived from the Government\u2019s SME policy and \ndevelopment framework. Drawing on work of the National Task Force on Development of SMEs \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2006.

It reflects a continuing effort by ADB to help develop the domestic market, which \nwill be critical if resources are to be mobilized to support private sector activity and promote economic growth. Part 2 \nwill enhance the governance and capacity of the insurance sector, as it will support government-led reforms being \npursued in the insurance sector. These twin efforts are being undertaken in parallel with a reform program supported \nby the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank aimed at strengthening Bangladesh\u2019s banking sector. \n29 ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant for the Good Governance Program in the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh.

Manila; and (ii) ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance: Supporting Good Governance \nInitiatives II in the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. Manila. The aim of these TA projects was to promote medium- to \nlong-term development of collective anticorruption efforts at various institutions and to enhance the capacity of the \nAnticorruption Commission. \n ", "1 0 \n(SME  task  force),30 in  2005  the  Government  formulated  an  SME  policy  and  development \nframework in consultation with various stakeholders including SMEs and development partners. \nMOI\u2019s SME cell issued Policy Strategies for Development of SMEs31\u2014a policy and development \nframework that (i) provides justification for government assistance to the sector; (ii) maps out a \ngovernment development strategy to support the SME sector over the short, medium, and long \nterm; (iii) identifies areas of assistance to SMEs to enhance their access to capital, business \nsupport services, and technology to improve their product marketability and competitiveness; (iv) \ndelineates  the  institutional  setup  to  take  responsibility  for  SME  sector  development;  and  (v) \nincorporates internationally accepted market-based principles for SME development.  \n \n25.  To  promote  SME  development  in  the  nonmetropolitan  areas,  SMEs  established  in \nnonmetropolitan areas are entitled to tax incentives (such as a minimum 75% income tax rebate \nand  accelerated  depreciation  rates  for  plant  and  machinery)  for  a  longer  period  than  SMEs \nestablished in metropolitan areas with effect from FY2006.32 The 2008\u20132009 budget also promotes \nSME development through special tax incentives. Specifically, SMEs with annual turnover of less \nthan Tk.2.4 million are now tax exempt. Furthermore, the minimum individual income tax level was \nraised to Tk165,000 for the male taxpayer and Tk180,000 for the female taxpayer from the existing \nTk150,000 level. Raising the minimum individual income tax level acts as an incentive to SMEs.  \n \n4.  ADB Support for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development  \n26.  ADB has provided sustained support for the SME sector in Bangladesh through efforts to \nbroaden  financial  markets  (paras.  19\u201322)  and  SME-focused  interventions.33 Such  long-term \nstructural issues as developing the capital market and availability to the private sector of alternative \nsources of medium- to long-term funds are being addressed through ADB support. ADB is also \nproviding support for infrastructure development involving ports, highways, and roads that will \nenhance SME competitiveness and provide the basis for a higher growth rate (para. 18). \n \n27.  The two-tranche program loan component under ADB\u2019s ongoing SMESDP (footnote 14) is \ndeemed successful as both tranches were released.34 The SMESDP created a conducive policy \nand regulatory framework to facilitate SME development. Specifically, the program loan achieved \n                                                 \n30 The SME task force was established by the Government on 5 November 2003 to prioritize specific elements of SME \npolicies from the perspective of Bangladesh.

The \nsecond tranche was released in July 2008 after 10 conditions were assessed as fully complied with, two conditions \nwere assessed as substantially complied with, and one condition required a waiver.  ", "   11    \nthe  following  three  outcomes:35 First,  the  establishment  of  an  SME  policy  and  development \nframework to provide impetus and guidance for development of the sector (para. 24). Second, the \nestablishment  of  an  institutional  structure  and  necessary  mechanisms  to  support  SME \ndevelopment. The Government created the SME Foundation with support from ADB\u2019s SMESDP in \nNovember 2006 as an independent apex body for SMEs under the Companies Act, 1994, to have \nat least 50% private sector representation on the board and a chief executive officer recruited from \nthe private sector. The SME Foundation will assume the responsibilities for implementing the SME \ndevelopment  strategy  including  (i)  policy  advocacy  and  intervention  for  SME  growth,  (ii) \nestablishment of a comprehensive SME database, (iii) human resource development and capacity \nbuilding based on training needs assessment, (iv) facilitating application of new technology for \nSME  growth,  (v) administering  and  supporting  SME  access  to  finance,  and  (vi)  conducting \nproductivity and quality improvement programs. The Government is in the process of hiring a full-\ntime chief executive officer for the SME Foundation, and strengthening of the institutional capacity \nof  foundation  is  ongoing  through  training,  exposure  to  international  best  practices,  on-the-job \nlearning, and organizational development.36  \n \n28.  The third outcome of the program loan defined government support to SMEs and facilitated \nSME access to various services. This entailed (i) rationalization of government assistance to the \nSME sector through BSCIC restructuring (para. 16); (ii) provision of SME tax incentives (para. 25); \n(iii) enhancement of SME access to market, government services, capacity development, and \nproduct certification, including upgrading of the current product certification system to international \nstandard  (paras.  16\u201317);  and  (iv)  development  of  an  integrated  SME  database  for  improved \ntargeting of assistance. Within item (iii), targeted SME capacity development (for rural nonfarm \nenterprises, women\u2019s enterprises, and participating financial institutions (PFIs)) to improve SME \nperformance  and  competitiveness  commenced  in  September  2008  and  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by June 2010. The scope of the targeted SME capacity building component is being \nenlarged to enhance capacity of PFIs to undertake financial analysis of SMEs, particularly in rural \nand non-urban areas. For item (iv), the development of an integrated SME database by MOI and \nBangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  should  be  completed  by  June  2010.  Once  completed,  the \ndatabase will serve as the basis for monitoring SME performance and development as well as for \ntargeting assistance. The proposed Bangladesh Public Expenditure Support Facility (a firm 2009 \nloan) supports the Government\u2019s SME efforts of promoting women entrepreneurship, issuing credit \nprovision  guidelines  on  the  basis  of  risk-based  assessment,  and  establishing  SME  centers \nnationwide. The facility also supports the Government\u2019s endeavor to establish a financial institution \nfrom the merger of Bangladesh Shilpa Bank and Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Shangstha to provide \nenhanced financing for the private sector, including for SME development.    \n \n29.  The $30 million credit assistance loan under ADB\u2019s SMESDP, i.e., the Small Enterprise \nFund, was fully utilized by the end of June 2009\u2014about 12 months ahead of schedule (over the \npast 3 years, total SME lending volume in the country has significantly expanded at an average \nannual growth rate of 55%). SMEs in Dhaka and Chittagong districts disproportionately benefited \nfrom the credit assistance loan. Out of a total of 64 districts in the country, Dhaka and Chittagong \ndistricts utilized 55% of the credit line while 45% of the credit line was utilized by the remaining \n62 districts in terms of disbursement volume. Similarly, more than 50% of the enterprises that \nutilized this credit line were only from Dhaka and Chittagong districts (1,403 enterprises) while \n1,396 enterprises were from the remaining 62 districts. In terms of sector distribution, 27% of the \ntotal volume of the credit line was disbursed to the manufacturing sector, 57% to the trade sector, \nand 16% to the services sector. The subloan repayment performance for the credit line was \n                                                 \n35 A TA loan attached to the SMESDP is providing technical advice and resources needed to build capacity and assist in \nprogram implementation to achieve the stated outcomes of the program. \n36 The European Commission\u2019s \u20ac19 million TA grant for Integrated Support to Poverty and Inequality Reduction through \nEnterprise Development, which is scheduled for approval in September 2009, will be harmonized with ADB\u2019s SMESDP \nto enhance the institutional capacity of the SME Foundation.   \n ", "1 2 \nexcellent, as PFIs reported a subloan repayment rate of 93%\u201397% by subborrowers (almost all of \nwhich were small enterprises). No issues with regard to PFI compliance with the environmental \nmanagement system (EMS) framework were reported by Bangladesh Bank under the credit line.    \n \n5.  Lessons  \n30.  Based on lessons from the SMESDP (para. 29), the Project will stimulate activities in areas \noutside of the two main metropolitan centers\u2014Dhaka and Chittagong\u2014which will be important for \noverall  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  Bangladesh.  The  design  of  the  Project \nincorporates lessons from a review carried out by the ADB Independent Evaluation Department on \nthe performance of ADB\u2019s financial intermediation loans to development finance institutions that \nhighlighted governance issues including direct lending, weak credit analysis, deficiencies in the \nmonitoring of projects, and pricing mismatches.37 Critical remedial measures proposed by the \nIndependent Evaluation Department were as follows: (i) appropriate selection of effective private \nsector banks and selective use of performance-oriented state-owned banks are crucial to efficient \ndelivery of SME subloans, and (ii) autonomy in lending and pricing decisions since market-based \nonlending rates are more effective than subsidized credit. \n \n31.  The design of the Project also incorporates important recommendations put forth by a \nspecial evaluation study update38 on financial intermediation support by the ADB Independent \nEvaluation Department and a best-practice note39 on SME support by the ADB Regional and \nSustainable Development Department. Both studies emphasize that the following three-pronged \nprogram where the elements are mutually complementary needs to be adopted to build a strong \nfoundation for efficient and effective SME financial intermediation: (i) creating a conducive policy \nand regulatory framework to ease constraints on SME finance and private sector development; \n(ii) developing a broad-based, competitive, and efficient financial sector to provide entrepreneurs \nwith  alternative  sources  of  investment  capital,  a  diversified  selection  of  new  and  innovative \nproducts,  competitive  rates,  and  efficient  services  to  make  their  investments  viable;  and \n(iii) promoting SME support services such as skills, trades, entrepreneurship, and other business \ndevelopment  services.  In  line  with  the  key  recommendations  of  both  evaluation  studies,  the \nefficiency and effectiveness of the proposed Project\u2019s credit facility will be facilitated by (i) a \nconducive  SME  policy  and  regulatory  framework  that  has  been  created  under  the  SMESDP \n(paras. 27\u201328); (ii) broad-based and significant financial sector reforms under way (paras. 19\u201322); \nand (iii) the promotion of SME support services by the Government, ADB, and other development \npartners (paras. 16\u201317, 28, 32\u201333).  \n \n6.  Development Partner Coordination \n32.  Since the development partners (except ADB and the World Bank)40 are engaged solely in \nTA grant support for SMEs in Bangladesh, the proposed Project\u2019s credit facility complements the \ndevelopment partners\u2019 extensive TA activities (i.e., nationwide TA coverage and encompassing all \nSME  subsectors),  which  will  yield  synergistic  effects  for  SME  development  in  Bangladesh. \nSpecifically, several development partner TA activities will directly ensure enhanced access to \nfinance of the Project\u2019s credit facility by SMEs. One of IFC-SEDF\u2019s components under the ongoing \nphase 2 of its SME development activities includes an access to finance program that supports \nPFIs through a combination of TA and policy-related work, particularly enhancing PFIs\u2019 capacity for \nSME financing with regard to financing product development, risk management practices, and \nknowledge dissemination. A component under the European Commission\u2019s upcoming \u20ac19 million \n                                                 \n37 ADB. 2005. Annual Evaluation Report: 2005 Annual Evaluation Review.

", "   13    \nTA  grant  for  Integrated  Support  to  Poverty  and  Inequality  Reduction  through  Enterprise \nDevelopment  in  September  2009  will  introduce  sustainable  improvements  in  SME  access  to \nappropriate  and  affordable  finance.  Specific  measures  include  (i) capacity  development  of \nBangladesh  Bank  Training  Academy  through  collaboration  with  the  European  Bank  Training \nAssociation41 to train bank regulators on how to improve the regulatory framework that supports \nenhancing SME access to appropriate and affordable finance; and (ii) capacity development of the \nBangladesh Institute of Bank Management through collaboration with the European Bank Training \nAssociation to train the management and staff of commercial banks on all aspects of SME banking, \nincluding financial product development suitable to SME needs and cash-flow-based lending.   \n \n33.  After successful completion of phase 1 in December 2008, IFC-SEDF commenced phase 2 \nof its SME development activities in January 2009 (phase 2 is a $36 million TA grant to be \nconcluded in June 2014), which builds on phase 1 and includes (i) an access to finance program \n(para.  32);  (ii)  a  sector  development  and  business  services  program  that  facilitates  the \ndevelopment of firms providing business development products and services; and (iii) a business \nenabling environment program that promotes trade, enhances gender development, and develops \nconducive policy and regulatory frameworks. The World Bank and DFID are collaborating in the \nPrivate  Sector  Development  Support  Project (para.  18)  to  make  infrastructure  investments  in \neconomic zones (including SMEs). In March 2007, the Private Sector Development Support Project \nsupported the creation of a TA fund\u2014the Bangladesh Investment Climate Fund\u2014a separate entity \nmanaged  by  IFC.  The  activities  of  the  IFC  Bangladesh  Investment  Climate  Fund  provide \nconsiderable synergy to the Private Sector Development Support Project by providing advisory \nassistance to ensure a sustainable, long-term impact of economic zone infrastructure investments \nthrough improvements in the regulatory framework. The Japan International Cooperation Agency \nundertakes SME activities in Bangladesh through its Private Sector Development Program, which \nincludes SME studies (specifically silk, jute, and software industries) on potential industry growth \nfor export diversification. The United States Agency for International Development commenced an \n$11  million  5-year  TA  grant  for  Poverty  Reduction  by  Increasing  the  Competitiveness  of \nEnterprises in February 2008 to alleviate constraints hindering the competitiveness of selected \nSME subsectors. An external coordination matrix is in Appendix 3. \n \n7.  ADB Support in the Context of the Global Financial Crisis \n34.  The SME sector is critical for investment, growth, and employment creation in the context of \nthe projected economic slowdown (para. 2) from the global financial crisis since SMEs account for \nabout 25% of GDP and more than 75% of employment in Bangladesh. A dynamic SME sector is \nalso needed to reduce regional differences (para. 3) by accelerating growth for employment and \nprivate sector development, especially in the rural and nonurban (i.e., nonmetropolitan) areas. The \ncontribution  of  SMEs  to  economic  growth  depends  on  financial  and  nonfinancial  inputs  for \nstimulating start-up SMEs and growth of established SMEs. Government initiatives (paras. 23\u201325) \nand ADB\u2019s interventions for SME development, as well as the ongoing financial reforms (paras. \n19\u201322) and infrastructure investments (para. 18), provide the opportunity for accelerating SME \ndevelopment.  However,  inadequate  mobilization  of  medium-  to  long-term  resources  by  the \ndomestic market and the SME financing pattern skewed in favor of the metropolitan areas of \nDhaka and Chittagong (para. 29) have resulted in a large demand\u2013supply gap, especially for rural \nand nonurban (i.e., nonmetropolitan) SMEs. Nonmetropolitan SMEs have bankable demand for \ncredit, so access to adequate medium- to long-term credit is important for enabling them to benefit \nfrom  economic  opportunities  by  adopting  new  technologies  and  business  processes.  This  is \nimportant  for  increasing  and  diversifying  sources  of  income  in  the  rural  and  nonurban \n(i.e., nonmetropolitan) areas. Accordingly, support for SMEs, particularly SMEs in the nonurban \nand rural areas, is integral to the economic growth strategy of the Government.  \n                                                 \n41 The European Bank Training Association is a well-established network of national banking training institutes across the \nEuropean Union.  \n ", "1 4 \n \n35.  In the context of the financial crisis, enhanced access to finance to enable SMEs to operate \nat full potential is a key stimulus measure for which the Government has sought ADB support \n(Section D of Appendix 2 analyzes the financial crisis impact on SME activities and SME credit \ndemand in Bangladesh). The Project is therefore a credit line and a follow-on to ADB\u2019s ongoing \nSMESDP (footnote 14). The credit line for $30 million under the ongoing SMESDP was fully \nutilized by June 2009, about 12 months ahead of schedule. Accordingly, and consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan 2009\u20132011 for Bangladesh,42 the Project provides a credit facility \nto PFIs for onlending to SMEs, particularly SMEs located in the rural and nonurban areas. This will \nfill a critical market gap and catalyze the establishment and development of rural and nonurban \n(i.e., nonmetropolitan) SMEs. The Project builds on lessons in SME development (paras. 30\u201331) \nand is firmly anchored to the market, with risk-based pricing consistent with Basel II requirements.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n36.  The impact of the Project will be contribution to continuing economic growth and poverty \nreduction through development and growth of the SME sector. A vibrant SME sector is critical for \ninvestment, growth, and employment creation in the context of the projected economic slowdown. \nThe Project\u2019s specific and immediate expected outcome will be enhanced growth in the number \nand size of commercially viable SMEs, especially SMEs in rural and nonurban areas with emphasis \non women-led SMEs, as well as increased employment in the SME sector. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Outputs  \n37.  Credit facility. The Project comprises a credit facility for expansion of medium- to long-\nterm financing by PFIs to SMEs located outside the metropolitan areas of Dhaka and Chittagong, \nwith emphasis on women-led SMEs. This will include institutionalizing social and environmental \nsafeguards in SME operations and credit provision by financial institutions. The eligibility criteria for \nPFIs, subborrowers, and subprojects are elaborated in Appendix 5. \n \n38.  Enhanced capacity of women entrepreneurs and associations through TA support. \nTo enhance the sustainability of the Project, TA grant support (paras. 61\u201362, Appendix 7, and \nSupplementary Appendix F) will be provided to enhance the capacity of women entrepreneurs and \nassociations to fully access the financial resources earmarked for women-led SMEs under the \nProject.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n39.  The Government\u2019s equitable regional development priority allows ADB the opportunity to \nsupport a high-priority inclusive development intervention. The request for ADB support recognizes \nits involvement with the financial sector, SMEs, microfinance, and private sector development.  \n \n40.  Rural and nonurban development. The Project provides critical support for minimizing the \nurban\u2013rural  divide  by  systematically  providing  business  and  employment  opportunities  for \npopulations outside the metropolitan areas of Dhaka and Chittagong (i.e., the populations with the \nhighest poverty incidence) to participate in, and benefit from, economic growth. Broader sharing of \nthe benefits of growth will reinforce the sustainability of the development process. Furthermore, \nsince Dhaka and Chittagong represent the highest level of clustering in the country, congestion \ncosts outweigh the benefits of agglomeration. Consequently, other cities and peri-urban and rural \n                                                 \n42 ADB. 2008. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2009\u20132011. Manila. The country operations business \nplan identifies access to credit as a priority constraint hampering SME development. ", "   15    \nareas offer many advantages in terms of availability of cheaper land and labor, and little or less \ncongestion. Expansion of nonfarm activities in those areas is therefore desirable from the point of \nview  of  balanced  regional  development  and  poverty  reduction.  This  is  also  consistent  with \ngovernment and ADB strategies for supporting growth in rural and nonurban areas.  \n \n41.  Enhancing  private  sector  role.  The  Project  enhances  private  sector-led  SME \ndevelopment for economic growth and employment by mainstreaming SME lending in the financial \nsystem instead of just defining one or a few PFIs. Currently, some financial institutions that are \nkeen to engage in SME lending are constrained by limited availability of term funds at reasonable \ncost while others need to be provided with incentives to expand their loan portfolio. The expansion \nof term funds at reasonable rates through the Project will induce financial institutions to focus on \nthe SME sector and trigger the expansion of their SME portfolio. Furthermore, the efforts of \ndevelopment  partners  (paras.  32\u201333)  to  build  the  capacity  of  PFIs  for  SME  lending  will  be \nleveraged through the Project\u2019s credit facility.  \n \n42.  Empowerment of women entrepreneurs. To ensure women\u2019s access to the opportunities \nand benefits provided under the loan, a gender action plan has been prepared (Appendix 11) to \npresent  modalities  for  addressing  gender  concerns  under  the  Project  and  its  associated  TA \n(Appendix 7). A portion of the Project\u2019s credit line facility will be earmarked to target qualified \nwomen  entrepreneurs  and  ensure  their  access  to  enterprise  finance.  The  associated  TA  will \ncontribute to enhance women entrepreneurs\u2019 capacity to access and optimally utilize the financial \nresources and services earmarked for them under the Project. \n \n43.  Key stimulus measure to address financial crisis impact on economy. In the context of \nthe projected economic slowdown from the global financial crisis and the likely significant impact \non unemployment in the economy, the Project is a key stimulus measure that enhances access to \nfinance to enable SMEs to operate at full potential thereby generating jobs and economic growth. \nSection D of Appendix 2 analyzes the financial crisis impact on SME credit demand in Bangladesh. \n \nD.   Project Investment Plan  \n44.  The project investment cost is estimated at $126.67 million equivalent (Table 1).

The Government has requested a loan of SDR 48,927,000 ($76.0 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. It will include such other terms and conditions as may be set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. The financing charges are not to be capitalized. The Government will bear the \nforeign exchange risk.   \n \n47.  Relending (Government through Bangladesh Bank to PFIs). The ADB loan will be \nmade available to Bangladesh Bank.  Bangladesh Bank will relend to PFIs in local currency  at the \nBangladesh Bank rate43 for a term not exceeding 20 years. \n \n48.  Onlending (PFIs to eligible SMEs). The maximum subloan size will be Tk7 million, of \nwhich PFIs will be able to lend up to 75% of subproject costs from the ADB and Government loan \nproceeds. The minimum tenor of a subloan will be 2 years. Onlending from PFIs to eligible \nsubprojects  will  be  at  interest  rates  that  reflect  their  cost  of  funds44 plus  a  spread  to  cover \ntransaction costs and risks. Subloans will be on commercial and competitive terms based on the \nPFI\u2019s  selection  process.  Subloans  will  only  include  activities  not  listed  in  ADB\u2019s  prohibited \ninvestment activities list (Supplementary Appendix E) and will be subject to post-lending monitoring \nand review by ADB.

Domestic resource mobilization efforts continue to pose a \nchallenge for financial institutions. Nonbanking financial institutions are limited in their scope for accepting deposits \nwhile banks face difficulties in mobilizing deposits because of market distortions where above-market returns (11.5%\u2013\n12.0%) are given to bond investors in the Government\u2019s national saving schemes whereas banks offer deposit rates of \n6.5% (savings accounts) to a maximum of 9.5% (fixed deposit accounts).   ", "   17    \n50.  Bangladesh Bank as facility manager. Bangladesh Bank was deemed appropriate to \nadminister the Project at this stage because of Bangladesh Bank\u2019s large contribution to the Project, \nits ready access to information in determining the financial soundness and capabilities of PFIs for \nproviding credit to the SME sector, and its function as administrator of the Credit Information \nBureau,  which  gathers  information  regarding  borrowers. No  feasible  alternative  for  facility \n \nmanagement could be found. Concerns about governance, conflict of interest, and lack of capacity \nof candidate facility managers earlier considered ruled them out. Bangladesh Bank\u2019s regulatory \nand supervisory capacity is being strengthened under the World Bank\u2019s ongoing Central Bank \nStrengthening Project. Guidance and support are provided in designing new bank regulation policy \nand strengthening prudential regulations, reporting, and enforcement. Bangladesh Bank has made \nprogress in improving its financial reporting, auditing, and control systems; and has adopted the \nInternational  Accounting  Standards  as  its  accounting  basis.  Furthermore,  the  Project  will  be \nadministered by well-qualified professionals in Bangladesh Bank\u2019s Agricultural Credit and Special \nPrograms Department, who have managed the Small Enterprise Fund effectively under ADB\u2019s \nongoing SMESDP. Bangladesh Bank will regularly monitor (i) PFIs\u2019 continued eligibility based on \neligibility criteria, and (ii) eligible disbursements against estimated PFI targets to SMEs at market \ninterest rates consistent with ADB\u2019s financial intermediary loan policy.45  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n51.  The scheduled implementation period for the Project is 3 years (October 2009 \u2013 September \n2012). The schedule is in Appendix 9.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n52.  Procurement under ADB-financed subloans will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) as they relate to financial intermediary loans. \nEligible subborrowers will be required to undertake procurement in accordance with established \nprivate sector or commercial practices that are acceptable to ADB.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy  \n53.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  EA,  and  IA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  During  review  missions,  the  financial  management, \ngovernance, and anticorruption risk assessments will be updated to ensure their provisions remain \nvalid and are helping to realize the Project\u2019s objectives.  \n \n54.  The Project seeks to accelerate and deepen good governance in PFIs in accordance with \nBangladesh Bank corporate governance standards and Bangladesh\u2019s international obligations by \n(i) ensuring PFI compliance with Bangladesh Bank\u2019s corporate governance measures as one of the \neligibility  criteria  for  disbursements  to  PFIs;  (ii)  incorporating  anti-money-laundering  risk \nmanagement requirements; (iii) reporting on corporate governance structures and activities in PFI \nannual  reports;  (iv)  applying  SME  lending  monitoring  system;  and  (v)  incorporating  good \ngovernance and anticorruption measures in loan assurances in accordance with the findings of the \ngovernance and anticorruption risk assessment (Appendix 13). The Project also seeks to enhance \n                                                 \n45 ADB. 2003. Financial Intermediation Loans. Operations Manual. OM Section D6/BP.

Disbursement Arrangements  \n55.  Bangladesh Bank, as administrator or facility manager of the Project\u2019s credit line, will be \nresponsible for preparing disbursement projections, collecting supporting documents, preparing \nwithdrawal  applications,  and  sending  the  latter  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Bangladesh Bank will (i) provide \ninformation to ADB on candidate PFIs, including its assessment of their eligibility for the Project\u2019s \ncredit line; (ii) disqualify any PFI that has become ineligible based on a semiannual review; and \n(iii) review utilization and repayments of subloans of PFIs. Bangladesh Bank will maintain proper \naccounts, procedures, and records adequate to monitor and record the progress of subprojects \nfinanced by PFIs every 6 months. Bangladesh Bank will review and report to ADB the utilization of \nthe facility through progress reports every 3 months. The terms and conditions of the facility will be \namended as necessary based on the outcome of the review in coordination with ADB to increase \nutilization  of  the  fund  and  respond  to  market  needs.  Bangladesh  Bank  will  also  monitor  the \nsocioeconomic and environmental benefits of the subprojects.  \n \n56.  To facilitate the timely release of loan proceeds and to expedite project implementation, the \nGovernment  will,  immediately  after  the  loan  becomes  effective,  open  and  maintain  a  project \nimprest account with Bangladesh Bank that is to be also managed by Bangladesh Bank. The initial \nadvance to the imprest account will be 6 months\u2019 worth of estimated expenditures or 10% of the \nloan amount, whichever is lower. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be used to \nliquidate advances from the imprest accounts. The maximum individual payment permitted under \nthe  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  is  $200,000  equivalent.  Appendix  12  provides  the \nfinancial management assessment report.  \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n57.  MOF-FD will keep a record of the utilization of the Project, and will ensure that the record \nkeeping  and  accounting  undertaken  by  Bangladesh  Bank  follow  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement procedures acceptable to ADB. Bangladesh Bank will maintain records and accounts \nfor the Project, which will be audited annually in accordance with sound accounting standards by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Annual  audited  reports  and  financial  statements  in \naccordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB, in English, will be submitted to ADB within \n6 months after the end of each fiscal year. The auditor\u2019s opinion of that part of the examination \nrelating to the imprest account and state of expenditure procedure should be separately set out in \nthe auditor\u2019s report. \n \n58.  The Project\u2019s monitoring reports prepared by Bangladesh Bank based on inputs from PFIs \nwill be provided quarterly to the EA and ADB. The reports will contain (i) description of progress \nmade during the period; (ii) changes to the implementation schedule, if any; (iii) problems and \ndifficulties encountered and remedial actions taken; (iv) the social, environmental, and economic \nimpacts; (v) the work to be carried out in the next period; and (vi) a summary financial account for \nthe Project with expenditures to date. Within 3 months of the Project\u2019s completion, the EA, through \nBangladesh Bank, will furnish to ADB a project completion report containing a detailed evaluation \nof project design, costs, PFI performance, social and economic impacts, and other details as may \nbe requested by ADB.  \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n59.  Bangladesh  Bank  will  need  to  maintain  a  project  performance  management  system \nsatisfactory to ADB. The key performance indicators and assumptions in the design and monitoring ", "   19    \nframework will be the basis for the system. Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, Bangladesh \nBank will have established the baseline for each of these indicators, and such information will be \nmade available to review missions and to the Government for future impact assessment surveys. \nThe scope of the survey, quantity and quality of data, and frequency of collection will be guided by \nthe need for feedback on implementation. \n \n8.  Project Review \n \n60.  To  ensure  responsive  and  timely  implementation,  there  will  be  review  missions  in \naccordance with the project implementation schedule set forth in Appendix 9. There will be regular \ninteraction between the EA, Bangladesh Bank, and ADB. Annual performance review will be \nconducted by the Government, Bangladesh Bank, and ADB. In addition, a comprehensive midterm \nreview will be undertaken by the Government, Bangladesh Bank, and ADB about 18 months after \nthe  Project\u2019s  effectiveness  that  will  (i)  evaluate  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation \narrangements; (ii) assess implementation performance against project indicators; (iii) review and \nestablish  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (iv)  identify  problems  and  constraints  and,  if \nnecessary, recommend changes in the design or implementation arrangements.    \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n61.  To enhance the sustainability of the Project, a TA subproject grant support amounting to \n$500,000 has been approved through regional TA funded under the Australia\u2013ADB South Asia \nDevelopment Partnership Facility, to be administered by ADB.46 The impact of the TA subproject \nwill be the development of women\u2019s micro, small, and medium-sized entrepreneurship in the \nsubproject area. The outcome will be enhanced capacity of women entrepreneurs and associations \nto fully access the financial resources earmarked for women-led SMEs under the Project. The TA \nsubproject will (i) help assess constraints and opportunities to women entrepreneurs' effective \naccess to the financial resources made available under the loan; (ii) support the financial and legal \nliteracy of women entrepreneurs and associations; (iii) enhance women entrepreneurs\u2019 capacity, \nproductivity,  and  competitiveness;  (iv)  promote  networking  among  women  entrepreneurs\u2019 \nassociations; and (v) develop a gender-disaggregated database for monitoring and evaluation of \nthe social and gender equality results. The TA subproject will be implemented in selected districts \nidentified at project onset based on a set of agreed criteria, outside the metropolitan areas of \nDhaka and Chittagong. \n  \n62.  The TA subproject outcomes will be monitored by MOF-FD and ADB through consultants\u2019 \nreports,  periodic  consultations  and  review  missions.  The  Bangladesh  Women\u2019s  Chamber  of \nCommerce and Industry (BWCCI) will be engaged for the implementation activities under the TA \nsubproject in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time).47 Detailed implementation arrangements will be set out in the TA subproject \nagreement.  The  implementation  team  fielded  by  BWCCI  will  comprise  national  experts, \nsubcontracted training institutes, and NGOs. The scale of consultant inputs, terms of reference, \ncost  estimates,  and  implementation  arrangements  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The \ndisbursements under the TA subproject will be made directly by ADB in accordance with its \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.48 \n                                                 \n46 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for the Development Partnership Program for South Asia. Manila (TA 6337-REG). \n47 The rationale for the proposed single-source selection of BWCCI is based on the following: (i) BWCCI\u2019s long-term track \nrecord and leadership in the area of capacity development targeting women entrepreneurs; (ii) its proven track record \nof engagement with the Government in supporting gender-responsive policy and legal and regulatory reforms; (iii) its \nfar-reaching  and  sector-wide  coverage  compared  with  other  like-minded  institutions;  (iv)  its  leadership  in  the \nimplementation of gender-inclusive and women-targeted training programs, trade fairs, institutional support, and \nadvocacy targeting the specific needs and constraints faced by women entrepreneurs; and (v) its recent adoption of \nthe first Women's National Business Agenda in February 2009. \n48 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "2 0 \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n63.  Since SMEs are private sector entities, the benefits of pursuing private sector-led regional \nSME development could be significant. More broadly, an emphasis on market-based interest rates \nfor SME credit introduces a sustainable development paradigm in contrast to dependence on \ngovernment-sponsored,  subsidized  programs.  In  this  context,  financial  analysis  has  been \nconducted and successful project implementation will develop support for sustaining private sector-\ndriven policies for economic growth.  \n \n64.  Rural and nonurban development. Recognizing that high incidence of poverty and lack of \ngainful employment opportunities fuel discontent and unrest, the Project\u2019s rural and nonurban \ndevelopment impact contributes to stability in Bangladesh\u2019s less developed areas. Designed to \npromote SME development, the Project will benefit rural and nonurban SMEs by improving access \nto credit. From 2009 to 2012, subloans are estimated to generate an 8% increase in SME sector \nemployment as well as an 8% increase in the number of SMEs established throughout the country, \nprimarily in rural and nonurban areas. Employment will help reduce the relatively high incidence of \npoverty outside the metropolitan areas of Dhaka and Chittagong. The Project\u2019s poverty impact is \ndiscussed in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy in Appendix 10.  \n \n65.  Institutional. Through expansion of medium- to long-term credit by PFIs to SMEs, the \nProject  will  synergize  the  SEDF  and  European  Commission  access  to  finance  program  that \nsupports PFIs through a combination of TA and policy-related work by catalyzing the nonurban and \nrural outreach of PFIs and the capability of PFIs\u2019 SME credit staff in terms of (i) project appraisal, \nsupervision, credit and portfolio administration; (ii) opportunities to apply relevant risk management \nand  credit  scoring  techniques;  and  (iii)  improved  operational  governance  of  PFIs  through \ntransaction-based accountability for corporate governance and anti-money-laundering activities. \nMainstreaming best practices in SME financing will also improve portfolio quality over time, which \nwill prompt other financial institutions to increase their rural and nonurban SME portfolios.  \n \n66.  Promotion of women entrepreneurs. A minimum of 15% of the Project\u2019s credit facility \nearmarked for lending to women entrepreneurs will promote qualified women entrepreneurs by \nensuring access to enterprise finance. Furthermore, the associated TA subproject will build women \nentrepreneurs\u2019 capacity to access finance resources and business services through supporting the \nGovernment\u2019s endeavor to promote women entrepreneurs and women-led businesses. \n \nB.  Risks \n67.  Achieving expected impacts will depend on several assumptions that are subject to varying \ndegrees of risks. Mitigation measures are being put in place where feasible. Major risks are seen to \nbe the following: \n \n(i)  SME  viability.  The  creditworthiness  of  SMEs  in  some  locations  could  affect \nutilization of the Project\u2019s credit facility. ADB\u2019s assessment indicates that PFIs have \nsignificant opportunities for lending to viable SMEs outside the metropolitan areas of \nDhaka and Chittagong. To enhance SME viability, the Government has provided \ngreater tax incentives for SMEs located outside the metropolitan areas than those \nlocated in metropolitan areas    \n(ii)  Delinquency. Delinquency risks that PFIs face in expanding their SME portfolios \noutside  the  metropolitan  areas  of  Dhaka  and  Chittagong  are  mitigated  through \n(a) improved access to credit information; (b) risk-based pricing; (c) Bangladesh \nBank  monitoring;  and  (d)  setting  up  dedicated  SME  units  staffed  with  capable \npersonnel, efficient systems, and proper procedures.  ", "   21    \n(iii)  Implementation. While the demand for SME credit is robust, there could still be \nimplementation delays if the eligible PFIs refocus their priorities and/or fail to sustain \nexpected performance standards. These risks have been dealt with by assessing \nPFI eligibility and commitment up front. In addition, the Project enables removal of \nPFIs in case of performance shortcomings.  \n(iv)  Complementary support. The risk of complementary support not progressing as \nenvisaged  is  not  considered  significant.  The  Government  fully  realizes  that \nmacroeconomic stability requires structural and sector reforms. In particular, the \nGovernment has reemphasized financial and fiscal reforms.  \n(v)  Private sector perception. Private investors\u2019 perceptions are critical for the flow of \ninvestment  in  SMEs  outside  the  metropolitan  areas  of  Dhaka  and  Chittagong. \nMeasures  under  the  Project  to  sustain  investor  confidence  include  PFIs\u2019 \ncommitments up front to provide credit to viable SMEs. For its part, the Government \nhas given priority to reducing regional inequalities by facilitating public infrastructure \ndevelopment, particularly in nonmetropolitan areas. The enabling environment for \nSMEs is also being enhanced. \n(vi)  Governance and anticorruption. Based on the governance and anticorruption risk \nassessment, 10 risks have been identified along with proposed mitigation measures \n(Appendix 13, Table A13.2). \n \n68.  Environmental and social safeguard policies. The Project is classified category FI in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  An  EMS  framework  endorsed  by  the \nGovernment on behalf of the PFIs is in Appendix 4. The Project will not trigger ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). The Project will not have any impacts on indigenous peoples or ethnic \nminorities  and  will  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  An  annual \nenvironmental  compliance  monitoring  report  will  be  submitted  by  the  PFIs  to  ADB  through \nBangladesh Bank. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances  \n69.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and Bangladesh Bank have given \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  The PFIs, subborrowers, and subprojects will at all times comply with the eligibility \ncriteria agreed with ADB; \n(ii)  The PFI onlending rates for subborrowers will reflect the cost of funds plus a spread \nthat covers transaction costs and risk adjusted returns; \n(iii)  The PFIs will ensure a wide geographical and sectoral dispersion of the subloans \nand give preference to underdeveloped areas and priority sectors as outlined in the \nGovernment's Industrial Policy; \n(iv)  A minimum of 15% of the suboans will be earmarked by the PFIs for lending to \nwomen entrepreneurs to ensure access by women subborrowers (the earmarked \nfunds that are not utilized within a period of two years of loan effectiveness  will \nrevert to the general pool); \n(v)  The  gender  action  plan  for  the  Project,  prepared  in  consultation  with  the \nGovernment and approved by ADB, will be implemented in accordance with its \nterms; adequate resources will be allocated for its implementation; and key gender \noutcome and output targets will be monitored regularly and achieved.  \n(vi)  No subproject will be financed that may have a significant adverse environmental \nimpact, and which could be classified as a Category A subproject pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Policy (2002), or which could have resettlement impact, or affect \nindigenous peoples, under ADB's  safeguard policies; \n ", "2 2 \n(vii)  Prior to approval of any subloan, each PFI will (a) establish and/or update its EMS in \naccordance with the EMS framework agreed between the Government and ADB; (b) \nhave an environmental safeguard specialist as staff or consultant; and (c) train and \ndeploy adequate number of its staff to conduct environmental due diligence, review, \nmonitoring, and reporting of subprojects in accordance with the EMS. Each PFI will \nensure that the subprojects are implemented in compliance with the EMS. \n(viii)  The legal and institutional reforms initiated for SME development in Bangladesh will \nbe sustained, and capacity development of the key SME agencies continues during \nthe Project implementation period and thereafter; and \n(ix)  the Government will continue to implement the mitigation measures described in \ngovernance and anticorruption risk assessment agreed with ADB.   \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n70.  Prior to the effectiveness of the Loan, the Administration Agreement, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, shall have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower and \nBangladesh Bank, and shall have become fully effective and binding upon the Borrower and \nBangladesh Bank in accordance with its terms. \n \nVII.

Overview. The small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector is critical for output \ngrowth and employment creation since SMEs account for (i) 99% of private sector industrial \nestablishments in Bangladesh, (ii) about 25% of gross domestic product (GDP), and (iii) more \nthan 75% of employment in the private sector in Bangladesh. Nevertheless, SMEs are not \nrealizing their full potential for contributing to Bangladesh\u2019s economic growth and employment. \nStrong SME growth could therefore underpin Bangladesh\u2019s drive to achieve prosperity and \nincrease employment.  \n \nA.  Major Constraints Facing SMEs \n \n2.  Productivity analysis indicates that smaller metropolitan firms are more productive than \nlarger ones in many industries. This suggests that, with efficient factor markets, resources \nshould be more appropriately redirected to assist these enterprises under suitable incentives. \nYet, small entrepreneurs are poorly skilled and educated, mostly informal, and most importantly, \nthey have limited access to finance. By limiting resources to these more productive and poverty-\nreducing sectors, the Bangladesh economy curtails its own productivity growth, income growth, \nand poverty reduction. As revealed in an investment climate survey, firms emphasize financing \nand infrastructure constraints as two major impediments to their development.1   \n \n3.  Limited access to finance. The overall supply\u2013demand gap for SME credit is estimated \nat Tk165 billion (paras. 11\u201312). While 75% of nonmetropolitan firms report a need for financing, \nonly 6% of nonmetropolitan enterprises availed of formal finance. In the past 3 years, 3% had \nborrowed from banks and 3% from nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and/or MFIs. Access \nto formal finance for larger nonmetropolitan enterprises (employing 10 or more workers) is \ncomparable to that of smaller metropolitan firms, with 32% reporting having a bank loan and 3% \nwith NGO and/or MFI loans.  \n \n4.  Scarce medium- and long-term credit. In metropolitan areas, 69% of lending has a \nmaturity of less than 3 years. A little less than half of the loans have maturities of 1 year. The \naverage loan term for bank loans in nonmetropolitan areas is 17 months, with 75% of loans \nhaving a maturity of 1 year. As a result, long-term financing is typically procured through \naccumulated  earnings\u2014leading  to  underinvestment  and  lower  employment  and  production \ngrowth, especially for SMEs.  \n \n5.  Limited  credit  information. Limited credit information also hinders financing to the \npromising  SME  market.  Credit  information  in  Bangladesh  is  inadequate  and  unreliable, \nparticularly to nonmetropolitan SMEs. A credit information bureau operated by Bangladesh \nBank contains current loan information for all borrowers of financial institutions regulated by \nBangladesh Bank. However, the system does not allow small businesses to build up reputation-\nbased credit and borrowers with poor credit cannot be screened.2  \n \n6.  Lack of legal framework and system for securing movables. SME entrepreneurs \ntypically have little land to offer as collateral, but they have movable property ranging from \nequipment to inventory to receivables. The lack of a functional legal system of registered \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2008.

Washington, DC. \n2  The system is not computerized and only contains information about current loans above Tk50,000 (not the full \nbanking history of the borrower). \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nmovable property, other than for public limited companies, is constraining the use of movable \ncollateral. Linked to this is the lack of a central registry to ensure the integrity of such collateral. \n \n7.  Limited connectivity to markets. Connectivity to markets\u2014market linkages, transport, \ntelecommunications, financial, technological, and information exchange\u2014is vital for the growth \nof peri-urban, small town, and village areas. Low demand is perceived as the most serious \nobstacle to doing business in nonmetropolitan areas, linked significantly to low access to larger \nmarkets.  \n \n8.  Inadequate  physical  infrastructure.  In  addition  to  limited  access  to  finance, \nBangladeshi firms have identified the primary hindrances for private sector competitiveness as \n(i) inadequate  and  poor  quality  infrastructure  (such  as  roads  and  energy  supply),  and \n(ii) difficulty  in  obtaining  land  (especially  serviced  land).  These  are  more  severe  for \nnonmetropolitan  firms  than  for  metropolitan  firms.  Serviced  land  is  the  single  defining  (or \nlimiting) factor of new or expanding entrepreneurs. \n \n9.  Disadvantaged women SME entrepreneurs. Women entrepreneurs are less educated \nand have significantly less access to enterprise finance. The rates of women entrepreneurship \nare lower among rural nonfarm enterprises compared with metropolitan firms. Nonmetropolitan \nenterprises owned by women are smaller, younger, more likely to be informal, and home-based.  \n \n10.  The lack of finance, infrastructure, and market connectivity reinforce one another and \nexacerbate the difficulties SMEs face in doing business. The constraints are more severe for \nSMEs in the nonmetropolitan/rural and nonurban areas (i.e., outside the metropolitan areas of \nDhaka and Chittagong), and this contributes to mounting regional disparity.     \n \nB.  Overall SME Credit Demand Analysis \n \n11.  The  market  size  for  loans  to  SMEs  is  estimated  to  be  nearly  Tk255  billion,  with \n226,000 potential clients (Table A2.1). This estimate is based on the following calculations:3 \n(i)  An estimated 5.9 million micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in 2003\u2014\nwhich, based on population growth, suggests 6.8 million such businesses in \n2006. \n(ii)  Only 2.5 million of the 6.8 million enterprises are estimated to have annual profits \nabove Tk50,000. \n(iii)  Survey findings indicate that 84% of enterprises want to borrow. Of these, only \nabout half will be both willing and able to borrow at a given time (based on the \nassumption that 70% of firms that want to borrow are creditworthy and that 70% \nof these are borrowing at the same time). This means that 1 million micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises are potential borrowers. \n(iv)  About 78% of these enterprises are micro, 17% small, and 5% medium-sized. \n(v)  The potential lending volume for each segment is calculated by multiplying the \nnumber of enterprises in that segment by the average loan for that segment. \nAverage loans are determined by the mean for each segment as defined by this \nreport\u2014Tk50,000\u2013Tk300,000 for microenterprises; Tk300,000\u2013Tk1,000,000 for \nsmall enterprises; and Tk1 million\u2013Tk5 million for medium-sized enterprises. This \nresult assumes that the midpoint of each segment corresponds to the average \nexpected loan for each segment. \n                                                 \n3  Ferrari, A. 2008.

Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on SME Activities and SME Credit Demand  \n \n13.  SMEs in Bangladesh can be broadly classified into two categories: (i) export-oriented \nSMEs, and (ii) SMEs geared to the domestic market. The export-oriented SMEs are primarily \nsuppliers to large export-oriented enterprises, e.g., in the ready-made garment subsector. SMEs \ngeared to the domestic market are mainly from the agricultural subsector as well as the poultry, \nfisheries, and local handloom subsectors. \n \n14.  Export-oriented  SMEs  and  credit  demand. Export-oriented SMEs have witnessed \ndownward pressure on their product prices because of the global recession, resulting in profit \nmargins being squeezed. These SMEs are facing increased deferred payments from larger \nexport-oriented enterprises, so credit demand by export-oriented SMEs has increased to sustain \nthe enhanced cash flow cycle. \n \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n15.  SMEs  geared  to  the  domestic  market  and  credit  demand. Product prices have \nremained stable, with an upward trend, since domestic demand has not been affected by the \nglobal financial crisis. As a result, producers are finding it conducive to utilize excess capacity \nand produce more. The increased production levels have therefore increased credit demand by \nthese SMEs. \n \n16.  Enhanced risk and limited growth of large corporations has increased bank focus \non SMEs. The market for lending to large corporations in Bangladesh is highly competitive and \npresents limited growth opportunities for lenders. Almost all lenders are active in this market, so \nbank margins are squeezed. Furthermore, the global financial crisis has slowed corporate \ngrowth since these firms are large export-oriented enterprises. These corporations are not \nundertaking any expansion or new projects. With slowing corporate growth, the risk profile of the \nlarge corporations has increased for banks since these firms are already significantly leveraged \n(an average debt\u2013equity ratio of 80:20) and the probability of non-repayment of these large \nfinancial charges has consequently increased. Therefore, banks are reluctant to lend to large \ncorporations.  In  contrast,  the  SME  market  for  lending  has  strong  growth  opportunities  for \nlenders because of a large supply\u2013demand gap for SME credit (paras. 11-12), and it is less \ncompetitive as there are fewer lenders in this market compared with the large corporate market. \nAs a result, bank margins are higher. The SME market for lending also poses less risk than the \nmarket for large corporations since (i) banks can significantly diversify lending in the SME \nmarket by lending a large number of loans (since each loan is small in size), which allows risk to \nbe dissipated; and (ii) SMEs are less leveraged than corporations (an average debt\u2013equity ratio \nof 60:40 for small enterprises and 70:30 for medium-sized enterprises), which allows room for \nlending and indicates limited chance of non-repayment (the current repayment rate for SMEs is \nexcellent  at 93%\u201397%, according to participating financial institutions).  \n \n17.  Increase  in  number  of  SME  service  centers  caused  by  enhanced  SME  credit \ndemand  and  increased  bank  focus  on  SMEs.  Increased  demand  for  SME  credit  and \nincreased bank focus on SME lending (over the past 3 years, total SME lending volume has \nexpanded by an average of 55% per year), caused Bangladesh Bank to approve the opening of \n139 SME service centers by the banking sector in 2009. In 2008, 88 SME service centers were \nopened to facilitate SME lending and other SME banking needs. The SME service centers in \n2008 and 2009 were primarily opened by private banks. These centers enhanced the outreach \nof banks as they are located in underdeveloped areas that are underserved by banks. The \ncenters operate like branches but are subordinated to branches. The private sector-driven trend \nincrease in the number of SME service centers opened in 2009 compared with 2008 provides \nconcrete evidence of enhanced SME credit demand, especially in rural and nonurban areas, \ndespite the global financial crisis.       \n \nE.  Summary Analysis of Key SME Subsectors   \n \n18.  A number of SME subsectors were studied carefully at the project preparatory stage to \nexamine their potential to enhance SME sector growth and help the economy recover in the \ncontext of the projected economic slowdown from the global financial crisis. A summary analysis \nof key SME subsectors follows (more detailed analysis is in Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n19.  Ready-made garments subsector. The ready-made garments subsector is the largest \nforeign exchange earner in Bangladesh, accounting for about 79% of total export earnings and \n ", "Appendix 2  29\n12% of GDP in 2009.4 There have been more than 4,000 ready-made garment businesses, \nwhich generate 2.5 million jobs and are the largest employer for women.5 The sector can be \ndivided into two broad categories\u2014woven and knit products. Knitwear garment exports have \nbeen increasing since the early 1990s and now surpass woven exports. The United States and \nthe European Union are the largest importers of Bangladeshi ready-made garment products, \naccounting for more than 90% of total ready-made garment exports. \n \n20.  Jute subsector. Jute and jute-related industries are an important part of Bangladesh\u2019s \nheritage. The sector has contributed significantly to the country\u2019s economic development. About \n20% of the total population is directly or indirectly involved in the sector, and jute production \naccounts for an average 4% of total GDP. It was once the highest foreign reserve earner, \ncontributing to over 80% of Bangladesh\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. From the 1980s, its share \nbegan to decline as synthetic substitutes and artificial fibers emerged. Although jute export has \ndeclined to less than 5% of total export earnings, it is still a major sector of the national \neconomy. Its foreign exchange earnings still reach about $300 million annually, and it is one of \nthe major cash crops in the country. \n \n21.  Leather goods subsector. The leather goods subsector is another key economic sector \nin Bangladesh. It is smaller in size, employment, and business investment than the textile \nsector\u2014contributing  0.31%  to  GDP  in  FY2003  (constant  prices).  All  the  leather  goods \nbusinesses are privately owned and a few belong to multinational corporations. The majority \nemploy fewer than 50 people and are export-oriented. \n \n22.  Agribusiness  subsector.  Bangladesh  is  predominantly  an  agricultural  country. \nAgriculture is the engine of growth of the economy. The  overall contribution of the broad \nagriculture sector is estimated at 20.87% of GDP in 2007\u20132008. About 48.1% of the total labor \nforce is directly or indirectly engaged in the agriculture sector. In FY2007\u2013FY2008, export \nearnings  from  agricultural  products  were  $987.56  million\u20147.0%  of  total  export  earnings. \nAgribusiness is related to the commercial production of agricultural commodities (including \ncrops, livestock, fisheries, and forestry); transformation of agricultural commodities into products; \nprovision of inputs to the production of agricultural commodities (including planting and genetic \nmaterial, agrochemicals, equipment, and pharmaceuticals); and the marketing and distribution \nof agricultural commodities and products.   \n \n23.  Plastic products subsector. There are about 3,000 plastic businesses in Bangladesh. \nOver half have less than 24 employees. The country has seen a dramatic increase in plastic \nexports in recent years. It contributed to foreign exchange revenues worth several billion taka \nand has the potential to become one of the country\u2019s top 10 exports. More than 200,000 skilled \nand unskilled people are employed in this sector, which manufactures moldings and other \nproducts for garment accessories, toys, toothbrushes, ballpoint pens, shoes, pharmaceutical \npackages, bottles, pipes, and plastic wrapping. Bangladeshi plastic goods are exported to \n23 countries. The plastic industry has played an important role as a backward linkage for \nvarious upstream industry sectors such as garments, medicine, and food processing. \n \n24.  Information  and  communication  technology  subsector.  Telephone  density  in \nBangladesh is among the lowest in the world. Telephone coverage has been improved by the \n                                                 \n4  Source: Bangladesh Bank 2009 and Asian Development Bank estimates. From July 2008 to March 2009, ready-\nmade garment exports accounted for 79% of total export earnings ($9.2 billion out of a total of $11.7 billion). This \nmay be compared with the estimated GDP for 2009 of about $80 billion.  \n5  About 80% of ready-made garment jobs are held by women. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nGrameen  Phone,6 but  there  is  still  room  for  further  growth.  Bangladesh\u2019s  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) subsector is not large, estimated at less than $200 million, but \nit  is  growing  rapidly  at  about  20%  a  year.  SME  ICT  businesses  include  (i)  support  and \nconsulting  services  for  various  types  of  ICT  work,  such  as  internet  services  providers; \n(ii) contracting and technical and services support for mobile phone and fixed-line carriers; \n(iii) software development;7 and (iv) other ICT-related businesses such as data processing, \nautomation, and call centers. Private sector involvement, particularly SMEs, is an integral part of \nthis development process. The ICT sector contributes to the overall development process and \npoverty alleviation efforts through employment generation, economic expansion, and exports. \nThe rapid expansion of mobile telephony and the internet greatly facilitate the business process \nand economic efficiency. \n \n25.  Light engineering subsector. The light engineering subsector supports basic industry \nfunctions  in  Bangladesh.  The  subsector  consists  of  about  7,000  firms,  employs \n800,000 persons, and generates annual revenue of about $1.6 billion or about 2% of annual \nGDP. The subsector manufactures a wide variety of parts, tools, and light machinery that supply \nall aspects of the national industries such as agriculture, food processing, chemical, transport, \nconstruction, and others. Improvement of operating efficiency, industry linkage, investment, and \naccess to finance are among the important steps to combat the dampened domestic and \ninternational demand.  \n \n26.  Handicrafts  and  silk  subsector.  Handicrafts  are  produced  by  family-based  small \nmanufacturing units to produce articles such as baskets, pottery, wall hangings, handbags, \ncarpets, and embroidered quilts. Handicrafts and cottage industries contribute to an important \npart of foreign exchange earnings, generating employment and creating opportunities to utilize \nindigenous natural resources. Members of crafts families or cooperatives are employed in the \nhandicraft production unit at the cottage level, providing the necessary linkages to SMEs. The \nhandicraft sector is considered a key area for future expansion in terms of export potential. With \nthe  low  cost  of  labor  and  rich  cultural  heritage  in  Bangladesh,  the  subsector  has  a  clear \nadvantage in the world market. The structure of the silk subsector is similar to that of the \nhandicraft sector. Silk production is highly labor-intensive and provides an excellent opportunity \nfor rural development, particularly in women entrepreneurship. \n \nF.  Growth Impediments and Interventions in the SME Sector \n \n27.  Preparatory work and complementary reforms have already been undertaken to help \naccelerate SME sector development (Table A2.3). \n \n \n                                                 \n6  Grameen Bank borrowers, mostly women, were given loans of about $350 each to cover the cost of the telephone, \nthe hook-up, training, and repair services to provide telephone services in their villages. They purchase air time at \nwholesale prices from Grameen Telecom and sell the telephone service to fellow villagers at the market rate. They \nact as human pay phones in places where there are no landlines and no one has even seen a telephone or made a \nphone call. \n7  Including system software, system infrastructure, and application software. \n ", "Appendix 2  31\nTable A2.3: SME Sector Growth Impediments and Interventions \nImpediment to SME Sector Growth  Intervention \nAbsence of secured transaction bill  Enactment of secured transaction bill by \nDecember 2009. \nAbsence of credit rating information system for  Government is facilitating the automation of the \nSME borrowers  credit information bureau at Bangladesh Bank \nto ensure availability of credit history for all \nSMEs through a DFID and IFC project to be \ncompleted by September 2010.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed Project seeks to facilitate the development of small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs), with specific emphasis on moderating regional disparities. The Project \nconsists of a loan of SDR48,927,000 ($76.0 million equivalent) from the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Special Funds resources for extending credit through participating financial \ninstitutions (PFIs) to SME subprojects outside the metropolitan areas of Dhaka and Chittagong.  \n \n2.  The  PFIs  will  be  pre-identified  based  on  due  diligence  conducted  to  analyze  their \nfinancial aspects as well as to determine their ability to handle social and environmental issues. \nHowever, since the facility is aimed at improving access to credit by SMEs, it is deemed \nappropriate to make the facility available to as wide a number of eligible financial institutions as \npossible, including those under the ongoing credit line of ADB's SME Sector Development \nProgram  (SMESDP).1 The  due  diligence  results  indicate  that  most  of  the  PFIs  under  the \nongoing  credit  line  of  ADB\u2019s  SMESDP  will  qualify  for  the  credit  facility  under  the  Project. \nExperience from similar credit lines (e.g., the SMESDP) indicates that lending to SMEs is \nunlikely to involve significant adverse environmental impacts. \n \n3.  The PFIs adhere to the rules and regulations of the Ministry of Environment and Forests \nof Bangladesh. Their current environmental management systems (EMSs) are under review by \nADB to improve and sustain EMS implementation, which will benefit the Project and the PFIs. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n4.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project is the Finance Division of the Ministry of \nFinance, and Bangladesh Bank is the Implementing Agency. Bangladesh Bank has overall \nresponsibility  for  ensuring  that  national  environmental  policies  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental assessment requirements are adhered to by the PFIs. The Agricultural Credit \nand Special Programs Department of Bangladesh Bank will administer the Project\u2019s credit \nfacility. As credit delivery institutions, the PFIs commit to updating or establishing and sustaining \nimplementation of EMSs. To ensure successful EMS implementation, the PFIs will allocate staff \nresources and develop procedures (relevant to the types of subprojects to be funded and nature \nof  their  impacts)  to  screen  subprojects,  conduct  due  diligence,  review  environmental \nassessment reports, monitor and report on implementation, and evaluate the performance of the \nEMS  for  continual  improvement.  An  annual  environmental  compliance  monitoring  report \nsubmitted  by  the  PFIs  through  Bangladesh  Bank  to  ADB  is  required  to  support  ADB\u2019s \ncompliance oversight of the Project.   \n \n5.  Bangladesh Bank through the PFIs will ensure that the environmental assessment will \nbe undertaken in a participatory manner with the PFIs\u2019 clients. Consistent with government and \nADB guidelines, stakeholder consultations will be documented in the environmental assessment \ndocuments.  Bangladesh  Bank  will  ensure  compliance  with  government  regulations  on \nenvironmental permits, licenses, and clearance. Release of any funds for specific subprojects \nwill be contingent on prior issuance of necessary permits or licenses and clearance by relevant \ngovernment authorities and/or by ADB, as required.   \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

The objectives of \nthe environmental policy are to (i) protect the environment, (ii) encourage the efficient use of \nnatural resources, and (iii) promote environmental improvement where possible. The national \npolicies constitute the basis for EMS polices in the PFIs. All the participating banks will comply \nwith  national  environmental  policies,  rules,  and  regulations.  The  Bangladesh  Environment \nConservation  Act,  1995,  is  supported  by  the  Environment  Conservation  Rules,  1997;  the \nEnvironment Court Act, 2000; the Water Pollution Control Ordinance, 1970; and the Acquisition \nand Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982. Other relevant regulations include \nbylaws related to pollution control, health and sanitation, and disposal of solid waste: the Mining \nSettlements Act, 1912; Mines Act, 1923; Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1983; Agricultural Census \nAct, 1958; and Antiquities Act, 1968.  \n7.  The PFIs will ensure subprojects\u2019 compliance with national environmental policies and \nregulations as well as with ADB\u2019s applicable environmental assessment requirements. The \nnational policies and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirements reinforce each other.   \n8.  The PFIs will only invest in subprojects  \n(i)  if  their  activities  are  outside  of  the  prohibited  investment  activities  list \n(Supplementary Appendix E); \n(ii)  that take account of the environmental impacts of their operations and take steps \nto avoid, minimize, and mitigate any risks; \n(iii)  that are designed, implemented, and operated in compliance with all government \nenvironmental regulations and requirements, as well as with ADB\u2019s requirements, \nas applicable;  \n(iv)  that will not have a resettlement impact under ADB's Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995), or affect indigenous peoples under ADB's Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998); and \n(v)  that take account of relevant international environmental agreements. \n \n9.  The operational principles of a PFI\u2019s environmental policy include \n(i)  ensuring  that  environmental  safeguards  as  defined  by  the  Environment \nConservation Act, 1995; the Environment Conservation Rules, 1997; as well as \nrules and regulations issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests are \nintegrated into project design prior to its financing and complied with during \nconstruction and operation; \n(ii)  adopting a risk classification system in accordance with government procedure or \ninternational best practice; \n(iii)  ensuring that no activities on the \u201cexclusion list\u201d are financed or fostered by PFIs;  \n(iv)  where potential adverse social and environmental impacts are expected, the \nmeasures to prevent these from occurring in the first place are preferred to \nmeasures seeking minimization, mitigation, or compensation; \n(v)  disclosing relevant information and consulting with project-affected people for \nsubprojects with potential adverse environmental and social impacts;  \n(vi)  where required to mitigate significant adverse environmental risk, ensuring that \nrelevant  international  best  practices,  are  integrated  into  project  design, \nimplementation,  construction, and operation; \n(vii)  encouraging  project  promoters  and  other  project  partners  to  adopt \nenvironmentally sound practices; \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \n(viii)  where  subprojects  have  potential  significant  adverse  impacts,  ensuring \nindependent compliance review by the PFI; and  \n(ix)  ensuring transparency in and commitment to continual improvement of its EMS. \n \nD.  Procedure  \n \n10.  Based on the procedure below, PFIs should develop their own set of procedures and \nrequirements  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  manage,  and  monitor  subproject  impacts,  as \nappropriate to the types and scale of subprojects, and regarding the nature, sensitivity, and \nmagnitude of subprojects\u2019 impacts.   \n \n1.  Screening \n \n11.  Screening measures need to be implemented by the PFI to ensure that subprojects are \nnot in the exclusion list. \n(i)  The PFI will screen the proposed subproject to ensure that it is not included in \nthe prohibited investment activities list.   \n(ii)  The PFI\u2019s safeguards specialist will carry out a rapid environmental assessment \nand prepare a brief report to summarize the results, including issues identified \nthat need to be addressed and the type and scope of environment assessments \nneeding to be conducted to mitigate the potential impacts.   \n(iii)  Using project classification criteria, the proposed subproject will be classified \naccording to the significance of environmental impacts. The category determines \nthe  level  and  type  of  environmental  assessment  (initial  environmental \nexamination or environmental impact assessment) to be conducted to address \npotential environmental impacts.  \n(iv)  The PFIs will only finance subprojects that will not have a resettlement impact \nunder  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  or  affect  indigenous \npeoples under ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n2.  Environment Assessment and Review \n \n12.  Environment assessment and review to be undertaken by the PFIs is below. \n \n(i)  After reviewing the proposal, the PFI will recommend the level of environmental \nassessment to be prepared if a feasibility study has not been prepared for the \nsubproject.  If  potential  environmental  impacts  are  few  in  number,  generally \nsite-specific,  largely  reversible,  and  readily  addressed  through  mitigation \nmeasures, narrower scope assessments (e.g., initial environmental examination) \nmay  be  conducted.  If  potential  significant  adverse  impacts  are  diverse, \nirreversible,  or  unprecedented,  a  comprehensive  environmental  assessment, \nsuch as an environmental impact assessment, is needed. If an environmental \nimpact assessment is required, it must include an environmental management \nplan  consisting  of  mitigation  measures  for  identified  environmental  impacts, \nstaffing, monitoring and reporting arrangements, and budget.  \n(ii)  If a feasibility study has been done and an environmental assessment report2 has \nalready been prepared, the PFI will conduct a desk review of the environmental \nassessment report to ensure the adequacy of the environmental management \n                                                 \n2  Environment assessment report is a generic term that refers to an initial environmental examination, environmental \nimpact assessment, or an environmental audit report. \n ", "Appendix 4  37\nplan to manage the risks, as well as to ensure compliance with all government \nenvironmental  regulations  and  requirements  and,  as  applicable,  ADB \nenvironmental assessment requirements. \n(iii)  The safeguards specialist and/or project team will present the initial findings on \nthe environment to the committee (e.g., credit and investment committee), which \nis responsible for approving the full credit appraisal of the proposed subproject. \nThe safeguard compliance specialist, reporting to the chief compliance officer, \nwill provide an independent view of the risks and assign an environmental risk \nrating for discussion by the financial committee and credit committee.  \n(iv)  The PFI should ensure that clients comply with the requirement for consultation \nwith project-affected people that is preceded by information disclosure to those \npeople. Information relevant to a subproject\u2019s environmental issues is disclosed \nand consultation with subproject-affected people is done at the early stage of \nenvironmental assessment work so that the views of the affected people are \ntaken into account in project design. For category A projects, consultation should \nbe done twice, with the second consultation process occurring when the draft \nenvironmental impact assessment report is available. Consultation will continue \nduring  implementation.  As  required,  the  PFI  will  establish  a  grievance \nmechanism as part of its project management system.   \n(v)  The  PFI  will  inform  its  client  about  applicable  government  and  ADB \nenvironmental requirements. \n(vi)  If the subproject to be funded is an existing facility, the PFI will conduct an \nenvironmental  audit  to  determine  the  nature  and  extent  of  all  environmental \nareas  of  concern  at  the  existing  facility.  The  audit  identifies  and  justifies \nmeasures to mitigate the areas of concern, estimate the cost of the measures, \nand recommend a schedule for implementing them.   \n(vii)  The PFI will conduct a site visit to validate or update the information or to verify \nthe findings of an EA or audit report (if already available).   \n(viii)  For any category A subproject, the PFI will be required to obtain ADB clearance \nof the environmental assessment. For these category A subprojects, a summary \nenvironmental assessment must also be disclosed to the public, and a full round \nof public consultation must be completed, for a period of at least 120 days before \nthe subproject is approved. A detailed environmental assessment report will be \nprepared for approval by ADB before the subproject is approved.  \n(ix)  The safeguards specialist will conduct an in-depth review of environmental plans, \nincluding the budget. Review will also be made of clearances and permits from \nthe Ministry of Environment and Forests, and relevant local authorities. The legal \nofficer formulates legal agreements with the subproject sponsor on safeguards. \nThe safeguards specialist assists the client in preparing tender documents to \nensure implementation by contractors of agreed mitigation measures. \n(x)  The results of due diligence from the previous steps are reflected in the feasibility \nand  appraisal  reports,  which  highlight  the  recommended  environmental \nmanagement or corrective action plan to mitigate the risk. \n \n3.   Monitoring and Supervision \n \n13.  During subproject implementation, the PFIs will monitor and supervise implementation of \nsubprojects with potential adverse environmental impacts. The review and monitoring activities \nof the PFIs include, but are not limited to, the following activities: \n(i)  Conducting site visits of projects with environmental risks and impacts. These visits \noccur during due diligence but more often at the implementation stage. \n ", "38  Appendix 4 \n(ii)  Reviewing project performance based on the client\u2019s commitments in the legal \nagreement, as reported by the client\u2019s monitoring reports, and, where relevant, \nreviewing with the client any performance improvement requirements.  \n(iii)  If  changing  project  circumstances  would  result  in  adverse  environmental \nimpacts, revising the environmental management plan and working with the client \nto address those impacts. \n(iv)  Requiring clients to notify the PFI immediately of any accidents and incidents \n(e.g., spillages) that have or are likely to have a material adverse effect on the \nenvironment, including any remedial action planned or taken by the company in \nresponse to the accident or incident.   \n(v)  If  the  client  fails  to  comply  with  its  environmental  commitments,  as \nexpressed in the legal agreement, working with the client to bring it back into \ncompliance  to  the  extent  feasible,  and,  if  the  client  fails  to  reestablish \ncompliance, exercising remedies when appropriate. \n \n4.   Reporting  \n \n14.  The PFIs will prepare and submit annual environmental compliance monitoring reports to \nADB within 90 days after the close of their respective financial years.  \n \n15.  In  the  event  that  a  significant  environment-related  accident  or  incident  occurs  in  a \nsubproject,  the  PFI  will  notify  the  project  steering  committee  and  ADB  immediately  upon \nbecoming aware of the matter and indicate the proposed corrective actions to be taken. Upon \nthe request of ADB, the PFI will arrange access for ADB staff to visit subprojects to verify \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s environmental policies. \n \nE.  Use of Independent Experts \n \n16.  Financial intermediaries for subprojects with potential significant adverse impacts may  \ncommission independent environmental experts to conduct full or partial environmental audits if \nthe  information  collected  at  screening  or  any  other  stage  indicates  potentially  significant \nenvironmental  risks  and  liabilities  (e.g.,  caused  by  regulatory  noncompliance  or  site \ncontamination).   \nF.  Capacity \n \n17.  The PFIs will endeavor to achieve high standards of EMS practice by recruiting staff or \nconsultants with environmental management skills and through in-house or external training \nprograms.3 Some specialist staff will be required to drive the internal process. A senior member \nof the management team will be appointed to drive the program internally and take responsibility \nfor designing, if applicable, and implementing the EMS. All activities related to the environment \nwill be coordinated by a dedicated environment staff member in the projects department.  \n18.  In addition, it is recommended that a separate function of the EMS compliance specialist \nbe established to assist the credit function in evaluating, monitoring, and managing all matters \ninvolving EMS risk. \n \n                                                 \n3  The PFIs are encouraged to send representatives to participate in relevant training programs sponsored by the \nSouthAsia Enterprise Development Facility of the International Finance Corporation.  \n ", "Appendix 4  39\n19.  By providing additional training, as required, the PFIs will ensure that their safeguards \nspecialists are qualified to play their roles and to discharge their responsibilities.  \n \nG.   Guidelines and Handbook \n \n20.  The PFIs are also to have available an environmental guidebook for clients to provide \nguidance on applicable environmental requirements and good practices.  \n ", "40  Appendix 5 \nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, \nSUBBORROWERS, AND SUBPROJECTS \n \n1.  Participating financial institutions. PFIs will be pre-identified based on due diligence \nconducted to analyze their financial aspects as well as to determine their ability to handle social \nand environmental issues. However, since the facility is aimed at improving access to credit by \nSMEs, it is deemed appropriate to make the facility available to as wide a number of eligible \nfinancial institutions as possible. The due diligence results indicate that most of the PFIs under \nthe ongoing credit line of ADB\u2019s SMESDP will qualify for the credit facility under the Project. A \nsummary of the due diligence analysis of eligible PFIs from ADB\u2019s SMESDP is in Appendix 6. \nThe PFIs must comply with the following eligibility criteria: \n \n(i)  SME lending commitment and capacity of PFIs. Each PFI must have (a) \nlending  policies  and  strategy  related  to  SMEs,  and  (b)  a  track  record  of \nperformance in relevant SME sector lending.  \n \n(ii)  PFI  operational  and  financial  eligibility  criteria.  Each  PFI  should  be  in \ncompliance  with  all  applicable  prudential  regulations  and  guidelines  of \nBangladesh Bank, including but not limited to those for (a) minimum capital of 9% \non a risk-weighted basis; (b) recognition of income; (c) loan classification; (d) \nloan provisioning; (e) overall nonperforming loan ratio and nonperforming loan \nratio  for  SME  loans;  and  (f)  anti-money-laundering  procedural  requirements. \nMoreover, each PFI must at least have a credit rating of BBB\u2013 (moderate degree \nof safety for timely repayment of financial obligations), in accordance with the \nBangladesh  long-term  national  rating  scale  of  Credit  Rating  Information  and \nServices Limited or an equivalent rating by a credit rating agency acceptable to \nADB.  Each  PFI  must  at  least  maintain  this grade  throughout  the  life  of  the \nProject. Provisions will be included in each participation agreement between \nBangladesh  Bank  and  a  PFI  that  require  the  PFI  to  (a)  maintain  financial \nsoundness;  (b)  conduct  its  operations  in  accordance  with  sound  financial \nprinciples and practices; (c) maintain a lending and investment policy acceptable \nto ADB and Bangladesh Bank to enable it to effectively appraise the financial, \ntechnical, environmental, and economic feasibility of investment projects; and (d) \nsupervise  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  investment  projects  by \nbeneficiaries. ADB reserves the right to disallow disbursements from the credit \nfacility of any PFI not conforming with any of the above criteria until such time as \nthe PFI is able to satisfy the criteria. Such PFI shall be required to remedy any \ndefault of eligibility criteria within 6 months of default and in any event, within the \ndisbursement period of the Project. \n \n(iii)  PFI  corporate  governance.  Each  PFI  has  to  demonstrate  compliance  with \nBangladesh Bank\u2019s measures1 for corporate governance of banks and financial \ninstitutions,  which  include  (a)  corporate  governance  structures  that  promote \neffective  identification,  monitoring,  and  management  of  all  material  business \nrisks;  (b)  systems  for  ensuring  compliance  with  all  statutory  and  regulatory \nrequirements; (c) implementation of financial disclosure requirements for market \nparticipants and observers; and (d) setting of corporate governance objectives, \nstrategies, and techniques. \n                                                 \n1  Bangladesh Bank is deploying continuous effort to put in place good corporate governance in banks by inserting \nappropriate provisions in the Banking Companies Act, 1991, and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, supplemented by \nprudential regulations and guidelines in line with international best practices. \n ", "Appendix 5  41\n \n(iv)  SME  outreach.  Each  PFI  must  have  demonstrated  capability  for  lending  to \nSMEs outside the metropolitan areas of Dhaka and Chittagong as evidenced by \nbranch operations, lending data, as well as plans or availability for providing \ncredit and advisory services. Collaboration between PFIs and NGOs and other \ncivil  society  institutions  is  also  crucial,  as  this  can  facilitate  and  play  an \ninstrumental role in the outreach programs. \n \n(v)  SME  risk  management  procedures.  Each  PFI  must  have  demonstrated \ncapability  for  proper  risk  management  with  adequate  processes  and/or \nprocedures (e.g., credit risk manual) that cover the necessary (a) credit risk, (b) \nasset  liability  risk,  and  (c) operational  risk.  The  PFI  should  have  the  control \nstructure and capacity to systematically evaluate credit risk appraisal, asset\u2013\nliability management, internal control and compliance, as well as market risks \n(e.g., interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk).  \n \n(vi)  Compliance.  Each  PFI  must  have  environmental  and  social  safeguards \nmanagement systems designed to identify, remedy, and monitor subprojects\u2019 \ncompliance according to ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies.2  \n  \n2.  ADB reserves the right to disallow disbursements to any eligible PFI for not conforming \nto any of the eligibility criteria until the PFI is able to satisfy the established criteria.  \n \n3.  Subborrowers. The following are eligible to access the Project\u2019s credit facility: \n(i)  Start-up  SMEs  as  well  as  SMEs  undertaking  expansion  or  modernization, \nprovided their fixed assets do not exceed Tk200 million (excluding land and \nbuilding) and/or their maximum workforce does not exceed 150 employees.3 \n(ii)  Qualified women entrepreneurs will be given preference to access the facility. At \nleast 15% of the credit line under the Project will be earmarked for lending to \nqualified women entrepreneurs. \n \n4.  Subprojects.  The  subproject  selection  criteria  has  been  designed  for  outreach  to \nnonmetropolitan SMEs. The subproject will: \n(i)  be located outside the metropolitan areas of Dhaka and Chittagong and have a \nwide  geographical  and  sectoral  dispersion  (preference  will  be  given  to \nunderdeveloped areas as outlined in the upcoming Industrial Policy, 2009); \n(ii)  be economically and financially viable; \n(iii)  be  for  start-up,  expansion,  or  modernization  activities  in  any  of  the  eligible \nsubsectors4 as agreed between the Government and ADB;  \n(iv)  comply with the environmental and social safeguard policies of the Government \nand ADB, and not involve activities in ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list \n(Supplementary Appendix E); and \n(v)  not entail any activities that may have significant adverse environmental impact, \nwhich  could  be  classified  as  Category  A  subproject  pursuant  to  ADB's \nEnvironment Policy (2002) or which could have resettlement impact or affect \nindigenous peoples under ADB's social safeguard policies. \n                                                 \n2  Each PFI will provide such written policies and procedures.  \n3  As defined in footnote 5 of the main text. The SME definition may be amended in line with the upcoming Industrial \nPolicy, 2009.  \n4  Except those on the prohibited investment activities list of ADB.  \n ", "42  Appendix 6 \nDUE DILIGENCE SUMMARY OF \nPRE-IDENTIFIED PARTICIPATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS \n \n1.  Since the credit facility under the proposed Project is aimed at improving access to \nfinance by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it is deemed appropriate to make the \nfacility available to as wide a number of eligible financial institutions as possible. The due \ndiligence results indicate that most of the participating financial institutions (PFIs) under the \nongoing credit line of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) SME Sector Development Program \n(SMESDP)1 will  qualify  for  the  credit  facility  under  the  Project.  The  following  criteria  were \nassessed to pre-identify these PFIs. First, qualitative indicators include ownership structure, \ncorporate  governance  practice,  and  risk  management  procedures  and  capacity,  including \ninternal audit and controls. Second, quantitative indicators include credit ratings; capital base \nand adequacy; and financial performance such as earnings, liquidity, asset quality, and/or \noperating efficiency. Third, pre-identification conditions include banking license, operating track \nrecord, commitment in SME lending, and SME coverage. The following is a summary of the due \ndiligence analysis of eligible PFIs from ADB's SMESDP. The detailed due diligence report on \nthe 24 financial institutions is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n2.  Bangladesh Finance and Investment. Bangladesh Finance and Investment has the \nnecessary legal and institutional prerequisites to establish its initial eligibility. Despite limitations \nin corporate governance and risk management, the company has adequate capital, improving \nfinancial  performance,  positive  operating  efficiency,  proper  capital  adequacy,  and  a  credit \nportfolio that covers industry sectors such as leasing, term finance, working capital, syndicate \nfinance, real estate finance, and SME finance. The rating by Credit Rating Information and \nServices Limited (CRISL)2 for Bangladesh Finance and Investment is BBB\u2013 in the long term and \nST-4 in the short term. Overall performance has the potential to improve. \n \n3.  Bangladesh  Industrial  Finance.  Bangladesh  Industrial  Finance  has  the  necessary \nlegal and institutional prerequisites to establish its initial eligibility. It is a joint venture leasing \nand financing company with a wide range of product lines, including lease finance, term loan, \nequity  finance,  and  short-term  loan.  Company  ownership  is  somewhat  concentrated,  and \ncorporate  governance  needs  improvement.  However,  daily  business  operations  are  not \nmaterially affected. Risk management is appropriate, with a separate credit risk management \ncommittee,  and  there  is  proper  oversight  on operational risk  and  market  risk. Bangladesh \nIndustrial Finance is compliant with Bangladesh Bank requirements regarding paid-up capital, \nstatutory reserve, and general reserve levels. The rating by Credit Rating Agency of Bangladesh \nLimited (CRAB)3 for Bangladesh Industrial Finance is BBB2 in the long term and ST-3 in the \nshort term as of May 2008. The overall performance is acceptable. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Bank Asia. Bank Asia is a top performing financial institution in Bangladesh and it meets \nmost pre-identification conditions for PFI eligibility. The total capital base is sound. The initial \npublic offering in 2003 was 55 times over subscribed. Corporate governance practice is strong, \nin terms of organization structure, delegation of authority, independence of the management \nfrom the board, and the track record of the management. The bank had good exposure in \nready-made garments, food, steel, and other SME-related industry sectors, and its branch \nnetwork is extensive.  Such an experience would facilitate future lending to SMEs. Bank Asia \nimplemented  the  credit  risk  guidelines  as  prescribed  by  Bangladesh  Bank.  Oversight  on \noperational risk and market risk is also strong. CRAB rated Bank Asia AA2 in the long term and \nST-1 in the short term as of May 2008, signaling it a very strong bank. Performance indicators \nare very positive.  \n \n5.  BASIC Bank. BASIC Bank has the necessary legal and institutional prerequisites to \nestablish its initial eligibility. It is a state-owned development and commercial bank. BASIC Bank \nis 100% government-owned, and it functions as a development finance and commercial banking \ninstitution. Therefore, the corporate governance structure prescribed by Bangladesh Bank for \ncommercial banks is not applicable to BASIC Bank. BASIC Bank's performance does not reflect \ncorporate governance issues. The lending portfolio covers food, textile, jute, forestry, chemical, \npharmaceuticals,  engineering,  electronic,  and  service  areas.  Overall  risk  management  is \nadequate, and it formed an internal committee to create awareness for implementation of Basel \nII in 2009. CRISL upgraded BASIC Bank's credit rating from A+ to AA- in the long term and from \nST-2 to ST-1 in the short term from 2006 to 2007. The financial performance was good but \naverage when comparing to its peers.  \n \n6.  Bay  Leasing  and  Investment.  Bay  Leasing  and  Investment  has  the  legal  and \ninstitutional prerequisites to establish its initial eligibility. In 1996, it obtained a license from \nBangladesh Bank as a nonbank financial institution (NBFI) under the Financial Institutions Act, \n1993. In June 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission granted the company a license \nto operate as a full-fledged merchant banker. The company's leasing, term financing, housing \nfinance, and merchant banking operations are complementary to SMEs. Corporate governance \npractices are yet to be standardized, and delegation of authority in Bay Leasing and Investment \nis limited. As for credit risk management, the practice requires strengthening. CRAB assigned \nBBB2 rating in the long term and ST-4 rating in the short term. Financial performance has been \nimproving in recent years.  \n \n7.  Dhaka Bank. Dhaka Bank has the legal and institutional prerequisites to establish its \ninitial eligibility. It is a private sector commercial bank focusing on corporate banking, retail \nbanking, SME banking, and Islamic banking. The board functions relatively effectively. There is \nan  independent  director  to  provide  impartial  oversight  of  the  management  performance. \nDelegation of power is adequate. Dhaka Bank has adequate SME sector lending exposure. Its  \ncorporate and commercial loan portfolio includes potential SME sectors such as textile and \ngarments,  real  estate,  trading,  and  manufacturing.  Dhaka  Bank  also  utilized  technical \nassistance from the World Bank and other development agencies for continuous improvements \nin its SME products and services. Dhaka Bank continuously builds its network with a total of 44 \nbranches and potentially expanded SME outreach capacity. There is appropriate mechanism to \ncover credit, market, operations, and compliance risks. CRISL assigned it an A+ rating in the \nlong term and ST-2 in the short term as of March 2009. The financial performance of Dhaka \nBank remained satisfactory.  \n \n8.  Eastern Bank. Eastern Bank has the legal and institutional prerequisites to establish its \ninitial eligibility. It is a private commercial bank and provides a wide range of financial products \nincluding SME banking. The overall corporate governance practice is conducive to the business \n ", "44  Appendix 6 \noperations. Delegation of power has been improving form 2007. Eastern Bank also launched \nsome new SME products in 2007. Both loan and deposit products are tailored toward SMEs. \nEastern  Bank's  credit  risk  management  is  in  line  with  the  prudential  guidelines  set  by \nBangladesh Bank. CRISL upgraded Eastern Bank's rating from A to A+ in the long term and \nmaintains its ST-3 rating in the short term for 2008.  \n \n9.  Fidelity  Assets  and  Securities.  Fidelity  Assets  and  Securities  has  the  legal  and \ninstitutional prerequisites to establish its initial eligibility. It is a public limited company and \nobtained  its  NBFI  license  from  Bangladesh  Bank  in  2001.  Major  business  sectors  include \ntransport  finance,  women  enterprises,  SME  finance,  term  loans  for  manufacturing,  and \nmerchant banking. The company's market share is small and corporate governance is limited. \nThere  is  still  no  audit  committee,  and  an  internal  audit  or  compliance  function  is  absent. \nDelegation of authority in the company is also limited. Although the current business pipeline is \nadequate, the company relies largely on a single (transport) sector and this imposes risk. The \nrisk management practice needs improvement, but various implicit guarantees and support from \nsponsors and clients reduce the overall risk exposure. CRAB assigned it a BBB2 rating in the \nlong term and an ST-3 rating in the short term. Financial performance is acceptable. The \ncompany's average efficiency ratio in 2003\u20132005 was high at 26.8% (compared with the peer \naverage of 17.6%). \n \n10.  GSP Finance (Bangladesh). GSP Finance has the legal and institutional prerequisites \nto  establish  its  initial  eligibility.  It  is  a  joint  venture  NBFI  and  obtained  its  license  from \nBangladesh Bank. Corporate governance in the company is adequate. Delegation of power is \nsufficient.  The  company's  primary  sector  exposure  is  in  textile,  transport,  education,  and \nservices.  Overall  risk  management  is  satisfactory.  The  company  fulfilled  Bangladesh  Bank \nrequirements  in  terms  of  paid-up  capital,  statutory  reserve,  and  general  reserve.  CRAB \nassigned it an A2 rating in the long term and ST-2 rating in the short term. The profitability of \nGSP Finance has been declining over 2002\u20132006, mainly from the deteriorating revenue in \nmerchant banking.  \n \n11.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nIn Bangladesh, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises account for about 80% of industrial employment and have the \npotential to create employment opportunities for the rural labor force. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), through \nbackward and forward linkages,a  can support higher productivity of the larger industries and boost the rural economy by \nabsorbing a large proportion of the rural unemployed labor force. Bangladesh\u2019s National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty \nReduction II (FY2009\u20132011)b (NSPR) aims to raise private investment and savings\u2014improving economic growth rates for \npoverty reduction and accelerating the pace of social development. For this, the NSPR supports the preparation of a strategic \nvision for private sector development, provision of institutional finance, strengthening of capital markets, and development of \nSMEs. The financial needs of SMEs and the issues related to the financial constraints faced by women entrepreneurs are \nclearly stated in the NSPR. Promoting women's entrepreneurship, and providing business support services and market \nsupport are envisaged as means to boost the SME sector and contribute to poverty reduction. Supporting SME development \nis crucial during the current global economic crisis. There are indications that the global financial crisis is beginning to affect \nBangladesh\u2019s economy through slower growth in export earnings and remittances, which is reflected through rising job losses \nand the return of Bangladesh\u2019s migrant laborers. In this context, promoting easier access to finance for SMEs is critical to \npromote economic growth and social protection. The country partnership strategy for Bangladesh (2006\u20132010)c aims to \naddress the significant demand for financial services in coordination with other development partners, mainly the International \nMonetary Fund and the World Bank. Improved access to finance and capacity development of financial intermediaries in the \nSME sector, through the loan project and associated technical assistance (TA), will support the country partnership strategy \noutcomes, i.e., higher productivity, employment, and income generation, leading to poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: GI \n1.  Key Issues \nIn Bangladesh, the SME sector accounts for 25% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and provides more than 75% \nemployment. A vibrant SME sector is important for investment, growth, and employment generation, especially in the context \nof the current economic slowdown. Enhanced availability of credit, particularly for sectors prioritized by national industrial \npolicy for increasing employment and exports (especially SMEs located in the nonurban and rural areas), is essential as it can \nsupport poverty reduction by creating employment opportunities for local people. Women entrepreneurs, who are generally \nengaged in microenterprises and lack access to capital, need to be supported. Support for a credit line targeted at SMEs will \nindirectly contribute to poverty reduction. The Project will address this important need, as envisaged in the NSPR. The direct \nbeneficiaries of the Project will be SMEs, which\u2014through financial intermediaries\u2014will have access to capital. \n \n2.  Design Features \nPro-poor sustainable economic growth is to be achieved through the Project\u2019s focus on measures to improve SME economic \ngrowth and development, especially in nonurban and rural areas, where the incidence of poverty is high. In addition, by \nensuring availability of finance, more entrepreneurs\u2014including women\u2014will be able to expand their enterprises, establish \nnew SMEs, or expand existing SMEs. This will create employment opportunities for entrepreneurs, employees, as well as \nlaborers (skilled and unskilled), thereby contributing to social development and poverty reduction. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nIn Bangladesh, industrial development is driven by the SME sector which is integral to accelerate economic growth and \ngenerate employment thereby leading to poverty reduction. A large proportion of the population, including microfinance \ngraduates and educated youth, are dependent on SMEs. Entrepreneurs in this sector face various constraints, including (i) \nlack of medium- and long-term credit, as most of the credit is short-term; (ii) the requirement of collateral and guarantee \n(entrepreneurs often do not have sufficient assets, such as land, for collateral); (iii) high transaction cost and limited credit \ninformation, which discourages entrepreneurs to access institutional credit; (iv) limited connectivity to markets because of lack \nof information and linkages; (v) lack of infrastructure and utilities, especially uninterrupted energy supply; (vi) complexities \nrelated to tax and tariff measures; (vii) low capacity of chambers and business associations in providing guarantee and \ncapacity building support; and (viii) low business management capacity of entrepreneurs.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  53 \n \n \nThe beneficiaries need access to medium- and long-term credit; business development services; connectivity to markets and \nmarket  linkages;  infrastructure  and  utility  services  (especially  energy,  transport,  telecommunications,  technology,  and \nbusiness information); and simplification of procedures to access institutional finance for SMEs. Availability of finance is \nconsidered the prime need, as most of the people have limited resources for investment. The Project will support enhancing \ncredit delivery for SMEs, especially in nonurban and rural areas, with a minimum quota provision for allocation to women \nentrepreneurs; and by extending information and other capacity development support to women entrepreneurs to access \nfinance and business development. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe Project was prepared in consultation with a broad range of stakeholders, including Bangladesh Bank, the Board of \nInvestment, the National Board of Revenue, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, the Bangladesh \nSmall and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC), the SME Foundation, city corporations and municipalities, various private \nsector agencies (including chambers of commerce and business associations), and development partners. In addition, in-\ndepth consultations were carried out with the Bangladesh Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BWCCI), the Women \nEntrepreneurs  Association,  and  Micro  Enterprise  Development  Assistance  and  Services  (MIDAS).  The  findings  and \nrecommendations of these discussions resulted in the identified need for capacity development initiatives targeting the \nspecific needs and constraints faced by women entrepreneurs (Appendix 7). \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.

Women-run businesses\u2014mostly micro and small enterprises\u2014are found in the production and marketing of \nagricultural and consumer goods, as well as the provision of services for local, national, and international markets. Enterprises \nowned by women feature some interesting characteristics regarding ownership, management, sources of capital, technology, \nmarket orientation. More specifically: \nOwnership. Most of the enterprises are owned individually and some are partnerships. Partners are mainly family members \nand friends. Larger undertakings requiring capital from banks are formed into companies mostly through the synergy of family \nmembers. Available gender-disaggregated data suggest that only a very small percentage of the total number of enterprises \nare owned by women entrepreneurs or jointly owned by men and women. Women\u2019s partnerships are often established in \nlarger ventures to protect family property without having meaningful involvement or control over the assets. Very few \ncompanies have female board members. A small percentage of women borrowers access loans from a selected number of \nbanks, and that too jointly with male relatives unless there is a specific program to lend to women for business purposes. In \nrecent years, encouraging trends suggest women\u2019s increasing role as sole proprietors and increasing access to institutional \nfinance. \nDecision making and management. Decisions related to choice of enterprise and market and borrowings are mostly done \nby the owner. For large endeavors, maintaining family control is also practiced. In many cases, the decisions are taken by the \nmale family members or according to their guidance. Two management styles are visible: (i) the owner is the manager and all \nthe major decisions in all areas are taken by the owner; (ii) the owner is the manager but market and bank-related activities \nare supported and influenced by male relatives. The owner and manager is the source of all information and skills, including \nfinance, market, and technology. For large undertakings, management and production technology may be hired externally. In \nrecent years, encouraging trends suggest women\u2019s increasing involvement in market and bank-related activities. \nMarket. Most women-owned enterprises produce or provide services for domestic markets directly to consumers or retail \nsellers. Often, the production and market are seasonal. Large enterprises sell to wholesalers and, depending on the product, \naim for foreign markets. Export is mostly in the area of handicrafts and agro-based products (including processed food items, \njute goods, glassware, and leather products). The quality and price of raw materials vary, small purchases limit the bargaining \npower; as a result, prices are high. Imported items are purchased through importers; as such, the importers receive the \nbenefits of any incentive in the tariff structure or protection. Most of the enterprises do not have backward or forward linkagesa  \nor are not in any subcontracting arrangements. \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan         Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n ", " 54  Appendix 10 \n \nThe gender action plan summarizes relevant gender design features of the loan, and reports on how women are to be \ninvolved in the design, implementation, and monitoring process. Gender design features include (i) earmarked resources, \nunder the Project\u2019s credit line, whereby a minimum of 15% of the funds are allocated for lending to qualified female \nentrepreneurs; and (ii) capacity development initiatives carried out under grant-financed TA subproject to strengthen the \nability of women entrepreneurs to avail of opportunities provided under the loan. In this context, the impact of the proposed \nactivities will be the development of women\u2019s micro-, small and medium-sized entrepreneurship in the TA subproject area. \nThe outcome will be enhanced capacity of women entrepreneurs and associations to fully access the financial resources and \nservices earmarked for women\u2019s SMEs under the ADB loan. More specifically, the TA subproject will (i) help assess \nconstraints and opportunities to women entrepreneurs' effective access to financial resources made available under the loan; \n(ii) support the financial and legal literacy of women entrepreneurs and associations; (iii) enhance women entrepreneurs\u2019 \nmanagerial  capacity,  technical  skills,  productivity,  and  competitiveness;  and  (iv)  promote  networking  among  women \nentrepreneurs\u2019 associations and forward and backward linkage industries. The TA subproject will be implemented in selected \nzilla  (districts)  identified  at  subproject  onset,  based  on  a  set  of  agreed  criteria.  All  gender-relevant  activities  will  be \nimplemented by BWCCI in consultation with the Government (Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance), Bangladesh Bank, \nand other relevant partners (BSCIC, the Bangladesh Industrial Technical Assistance Centre, the Bangladesh Institute of \nManagement, the National Productivity Organization, the Small and Cottage Industries Training Institute, and other chambers \nin the selected districts). \n \nIII.

Executive Summary \n \n1.  The objective of the financial management assessment is to determine whether the \nentities  implementing  the  project  components  have  acceptable  financial  management \narrangements\u2014including  procedures  for  making  payments,  accounting  treatment  of \ntransactions, financial reporting, audit of financial statements, and internal control procedures\u2014\nto avoid misuse or misappropriation of funds and assets. The assessment indicates that the \nProject is being prepared in an area of low financial management risk, as the entities that will \nimplement the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Project have successfully \nundertaken (or are currently undertaking) similar lines of credit from numerous development \npartners (including the World Bank and Asian Development Bank [ADB]). \n   \n2.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project will be the Finance Division of the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF-FD) and Bangladesh Bank will be the Implementing Agency (IA). Bangladesh \nBank was deemed appropriate to administer the Project at this stage because of Bangladesh \nBank\u2019s large contribution to the Project, its ready access to information in determining the \nfinancial soundness and capabilities of participating financial institutions (PFIs) for providing \ncredit to the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector, and its function as administrator \nof the Credit Information Bureau, which gathers information regarding borrowers. The Project\u2019s \ncredit facility will be administered by well-qualified and experienced professionals in Bangladesh \nBank\u2019s Agricultural Credit and Special Programs Department (ACSPD) who have effectively \nmanaged the credit assistance loan under ADB\u2019s ongoing SME Sector Development Program \n(SMESDP).1 The responsibility for major payments, accounting, and conduct of audit will remain \nwith Bangladesh Bank\u2019s ACSPD.  \n   \nB.  Summary  Project  Description  and  Introduction  to  the  Financial  Management \n  Assessment \n \n3.  The Project seeks to facilitate the development of SMEs outside the metropolitan areas \nof Dhaka and Chittagong, with the specific objective of reducing rural poverty. The Project \nconsists of a loan of SDR48,927,000 ($76.0 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources for extending credit through PFIs to rural and nonurban SMEs.  \n \n4.  Given the objective of the financial management assessment, the arrangements are \nconsidered acceptable if the EA and IA are capable of making timely payments as they become \ndue, recording correctly all transactions and balances, supporting the preparation of regular and \nreliable financial statements, and are subject to appropriate auditing. The financial management \nassessment also provides stakeholders an opportunity to discuss any issues related to the \nproposed funds flow and financial management structure and finalize actions required to ensure \nsound  financial  management  arrangements  exist  before  loan  effectiveness.  The  financial \nmanagement and accounting questionnaire was completed with the help of the EA, IA, and PFI \nstaff, and the final version is attached with the report.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n ", " 58  Appendix 12 \nC.  Country Issues and Risks \n \n5.  The  framework  for  public  financial  accountability  in  Bangladesh  is  founded  on  the \nprinciples of governance associated with the model inherited from the United Kingdom. This \nframework  is  widely  accepted  as  appropriate  for  the  country.  The  primary  accountability \ninstitutions and organizations for financial management, control, audit, and legislative scrutiny, \nhowever, need to evolve in line with the changes in the more advanced democracies of a similar \nbackground.  \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements  \n \n6.  The EA for the Project will be MOF-FD and the IA will be Bangladesh Bank. The ACSPD \nof Bangladesh Bank will administer the Project\u2019s credit facility. Bangladesh Bank will regularly \nmonitor (i) PFIs\u2019 continued eligibility based on eligibility criteria, and (ii) eligible disbursements \nagainst estimated PFI targets to SMEs at market interest rates consistent with ADB\u2019s financial \nintermediary loan policy.2 To ensure responsive and timely implementation, there will be review \nmissions in accordance with the project implementation schedule set forth in Appendix 9.  \n \n7.  Bangladesh Bank will be responsible for coordinating the inputs of all PFIs, including \nbenefit and impact monitoring reports for consideration by ADB. The IA will be responsible for \n(i) coordinating  with  relevant  PFIs  to  ensure  appraisal  and  management  of  subloans; \n(ii) ensuring that ADB information and reporting requirements related to PFIs and subloans are \nmet; and (iii) ensuring that all necessary submissions of accounts, related financial statements, \nand disbursement records are duly submitted to ADB.  \n \nE.  Funds Flow Arrangements \n \n8.  The coursing of project loan funds will be undertaken through Bangladesh Bank to the \neligible PFIs for rural and nonurban SME lending. Bangladesh Bank was deemed appropriate \nbecause of (i) Bangladesh Bank\u2019s ready access to information pertaining to the continued \neligibility of the PFIs, including financial soundness and capabilities of PFIs for providing credit \nto the SME sector; (ii) the strengthening of Bangladesh Bank\u2019s regulatory and supervisory \ncapacity  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Central  Bank  Strengthening  Project3 that  encompasses \nsupport  for  (a)  Bangladesh  Bank  reorganization  and  restructuring  by  reforming  human \nresources  policies,  outsourcing  and  training,  and  skills  upgrading  of  audit  and  other \ndepartments, (b) training and technical support for the payments and securities clearing and \nsettlements  system,  and  (c)  financial  market  regulation  and  development;  (iii)  Bangladesh \nBank\u2019s role in setting corporate governance standards for banks; and (iv) Bangladesh Bank\u2019s \nkey  role  through  its  recently  introduced  policies  to combat  money  laundering  and  terrorist \nfinancing. Adequate safeguards are in place to ensure appropriate use of loan funds since PFIs \nreceive project funds from Bangladesh Bank only (i) after PFIs have made disbursements to \neligible SMEs, and (ii) PFIs present detailed evidence of these disbursements (subborrower \nname  and  location,  disbursement  amount,  etc.)  to  Bangladesh  Bank  for  reimbursement \npurposes. \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003.

Staffing Arrangements  \n \n9.  Bangladesh Bank\u2019s financial management infrastructure will be adequate to provide the \nrequisite financial management arrangements for the Project, which will be administered by \nACSPD, having effectively managed the Small Enterprise Fund under ADB\u2019s ongoing SMESDP. \nThe position of project director will be assigned to the general manager of ACSPD. The project \ndirector will (i) liaise with ADB, (ii) liaise with all PFIs, and (iii) be responsible for the overall \nsupervision of the Project. The position of alternate project director will be assigned to the \ndeputy or assistant director from ACSPD. The major responsibilities of the alternate project \ndirector  will  include  overseeing  the  budgeting,  accounting,  and  reporting  of  all  financial \ntransactions related to implementing the Project under the overall supervision of the project \ndirector. For the reporting of all financial transactions, the alternate project director will be \nassisted  by  the  appointment  of  a  finance  officer  from  ACSPD.  For  the  budgeting  and \naccounting, the alternate project director will be assisted by the appointment of an accounts \nofficer from ACSPD.  \n \nG.  Accounting Policies and Procedures and Financial Reporting  \n \n10.  Bangladesh Bank and the PFIs are adopting Bangladesh accounting standards that are \nprimarily  based  on  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards.  Bangladesh  Bank  has \ndeveloped the capacity to apply International Financial Reporting Standards and to effectively \nsupervise and oversee financial institutions through the World Bank\u2019s ongoing Central Bank \nStrengthening Project. One of the components of this project is capacity building of Bangladesh \nBank through strengthening (i) the prudential regulations and supervision functions, as well as \n(ii) the accounting and auditing functions.   \n \n11.  The PFIs will have their accounts and financial statements (balance sheet, income \nstatement, and statement of sources and applications of funds) audited annually in accordance \nwith  sound  internationally  accepted  auditing  standards  by  independent  external  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The PFIs will submit, to Bangladesh Bank, to the EA, and ADB their audited \naccounts and financial statements not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year. In \naddition, the PFIs will submit semiannual unaudited accounts to Bangladesh Bank. \n \n12.  Through Bangladesh Bank, the EA will (i) maintain consistent records and accounts \nadequate to identify goods and services financed from proceeds of the Project, (ii) ensure \nseparate accounts for each project loan, (iii) ensure accounts and related financial statements \nare  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  international  accounting  standards  by  auditors \nacceptable to ADB, and (iv) submit to ADB certified audited accounts and financial statements \nwithin 6 months after the end of the fiscal year.   \n \n13.  The Project\u2019s monitoring reports prepared by Bangladesh Bank based on inputs from \nPFIs will be provided quarterly to the EA and ADB. The reports will contain (i) description of \nprogress  made  during  the  period;  (ii)  changes  to  the  implementation  schedule,  if  any; \n(iii) problems  and  difficulties  encountered  and  the  remedial  actions  taken;  (iv)  social, \nenvironmental, and economic impacts; (v) work to be carried out in the next period; and (vi) a \nsummary financial account for the Project with expenditures to date. Within 3 months of the \nProject\u2019s completion, the EA, through Bangladesh Bank, will furnish to ADB a project completion \nreport containing a detailed evaluation of project design, costs, PFI performance, social and \neconomic impacts, and other details as may be requested by ADB.   \n \n \n ", " 60  Appendix 12 \nH.  Information Systems \n \n14.  Since MOF-FD and Bangladesh Bank have undertaken (or are currently undertaking) \nsimilar lines of credit from numerous development partners (including ADB), the management \norganization  and  processing  systems  of  MOF-FD  and  Bangladesh  Bank  can  produce \nsatisfactory financial reports that meet the financial reporting requirements of the Project. These \nsystems ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data. The staff is adequately \ntrained to maintain the systems.  \n \nI.  Audit Arrangements  \n \n15.  The project accounts will also be audited by Bangladesh Bank\u2019s internal auditor and the \nOffice of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The audited project financial statements will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of the Government\u2019s fiscal year or such other date \nas ADB may agree.    \n \nJ.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n16.  Bangladesh Bank, as administrator or facility manager of the Project\u2019s credit line, will be \nresponsible for preparing disbursement projections, collecting supporting documents, preparing \nwithdrawal  applications,  and  sending  the  latter  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Bangladesh  Bank  will \n(i) provide information to ADB on candidate PFIs, including its assessment of their eligibility for \nthe Project\u2019s credit line; (ii) disqualify any PFI that has become ineligible based on a semiannual \nreview; and (iii) review utilization and repayments of subloans/subleases of PFIs. Bangladesh \nBank will maintain proper accounts, procedures, and records adequate to monitor and record \nthe progress of subprojects financed by PFIs every 6 months. Bangladesh Bank will review and \nreport to ADB the utilization of the facility through progress reports every 3 months. The terms \nand conditions of the facility will be amended as necessary based on the outcome of the review \nin coordination with ADB to increase utilization of the fund and respond to market needs. \n \n17.  To facilitate the timely release of loan proceeds and to expedite project implementation, \nthe Government will, immediately after the loan becomes effective, open and maintain a project \nimprest  account  with  Bangladesh  Bank  for  the  Project  that  is  also  to  be  managed  by \nBangladesh  Bank.  The  initial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  6  months\u2019  worth  of \nestimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. ADB\u2019s statement of \nexpenditure  procedure  will  be  used  to  liquidate  advances  from  the  imprest  accounts.  The \nmaximum  individual  payment  permitted  under  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  is \n$200,000 equivalent. \n \nK.

In  addition,  a \ncomprehensive midterm review will be undertaken by the Government, Bangladesh Bank, and \nADB about 18 months after the Project\u2019s effectiveness that will (i) evaluate the scope, design, \nand  implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  assess  implementation  performance  against  project \nindicators; (iii) review and establish compliance with loan covenants; and (iv) identify problems \nand  constraints  and,  if  necessary,  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation \narrangements.    \n \nN.  Conclusion and Recommendations \n \n20.  MOF-FD, Bangladesh Bank, and all PFIs have successfully undertaken (or are currently \nundertaking) similar lines of credit from numerous development partners (including the World \nBank and ADB). As a result, the financial management capacities of the EA, Bangladesh Bank, \nand the PFIs are developed to a satisfactory level to ensure smooth functioning of the Project. \n \n \n ", "62  Appendix 13 \nGOVERNANCE AND ANTICORRUPTION RISK ASSESSMENT \n \n1.

There is potential for SME-driven growth to correct regional disparities \nin specific sectors where performance has been relatively unsatisfactory in terms of quality, \nwaste, and distribution.  \n \n4.  Legislative and policy framework. The Government\u2019s past measures for supporting \nregional enterprises and SMEs have focused on the Government and the relevant agencies \ntrying to substitute the role of markets by subsidizing tax incentives or controlling interest rates \nand  facilitating  lending.  The  Government  and  the  relevant  agencies  have  also  provided \nbusiness support and capacity-building assistance as well as infrastructure facilities. Such a \npolicy  has  been  partially  effective  but  is  not  sustainable  on  a  long-term  basis  since  the \nGovernment needs to monitor and finance support activities as well as constantly improve the \nprogram  and  the  structures  of  the  relevant  agencies.  The  Government  has  accepted  that \nfinancing of SMEs should be left to the market, with private sector engagement, whereby \nbankable and commercially feasible SME projects are funded and established.   \n \n5.  Institutional  dimensions.  SMEs  are  institutionally  weak  as  business  enterprises \nbecause of limited production and technical capacity, inadequate market support services, small \nsize of operation, lack of access to business information, low-quality products, limited land \nownership, and lack of access to land  \n \n6.  Accountability and transparency. The accounting systems and information disclosure \nof SMEs will have to be improved to remove information opaqueness. Issues include weak \nguardians of accountability such as the comptroller and auditor general, Bangladesh Bank, \nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission,  and  Public  Service  Commission  that  encourage \nimpunity. The challenge is to strengthen these oversight agencies. Furthermore, limited credit \ninformation results in SMEs incurring high-cost financing.  \n \nB.  Risks, Their Severity, and Risk Mitigation Measures \n \n7.  Underlying assumptions. The main assumptions in the risk analysis are that (i) the \nGovernment will stay the course in its objective and intention for SME development, (ii) the legal \nand  institutional  reforms  brought  about  to  date  will  be  sustained  in  the  immediate  future, \n(iii) effective institution building and capacity development in key agencies will continue, and \n(iv) the Government shares the view that this assessment presents a thorough review of SME \ndevelopment risks.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 13       63     \n8.  Risk specification. The potential risks can be grouped into several categories: \n \n(i)  Legal risks include, for example, lack of legal provisions to deal with disputes on \nSME  loans  and  debt  recovery  as  well  as  inadequate  legislation  on  secured \ntransactions.   \n(ii)  Policy risks include, among others, reluctance of private sector banks to lend to \nrural and nonurban SMEs since they are considered risky ventures. \n(iii)  Institutional risks include weak managerial and technical capacity and skills in \nSMEs,  including  reluctance  of  management  graduates  to  work  in  rural  and \nnonurban SMEs.  \n(iv)  Regulatory risks include weak implementation of governance code and standards \nby Bangladesh Bank and other banks.  \n \n9.  Risk severity. The risks highlighted above are not all equally severe for regional SME \ndevelopment and the Project. Table A13.1 provides a risk severity matrix, which gives an \nindication of the four types of risks based on severity.1 \n \nTable A13.1: Risk Severity Matrix \n  Impact  \n    5  4  3  2  1 \nVery High  High  Moderate  Low  Very Low\n   \n5  Very likely  Type I    Type II    Type III \n     \nWeak managerial and technical     \ncapacity and skills in SMEs, including   \ng   reluctance of management graduates \nn to work in rural and nonurban SMEs \nurri 4  Likely  Lack of legal provisions to deal with  SME authority not       \nc disputes on SME loans and debt  adequately \nc\no recovery    institutionalized to \nnt  lead SME \ne\nv development  \ne\nof  3  Moderately  Reluctance of private sector banks to  SME does not      Type IV \nd  likely  lend to rural and nonurban SMEs,  capture  sufficient   \no   including investment in medium- and  credit below current \no\nh long-term loans, since they are  threshold \neli considered risky ventures  \nk Inadequate \nLi\nBangladesh Bank\u2019s policy adversely  legislation on \naffecting SME development   secured transactions \nWeak implementation of governance   \ncode and standards by oversight \nagencies   \nUnlikely \n2           \nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The degree of severity is calculated as the product of the range of likelihood of the risk occurring and the potential \nimpact of such a risk. \n ", "64  Appendix 13 \n10.

Controls for Corruption  \n \n11.  Effective  adoption  and  implementation  of  Bangladesh  Bank\u2019s  corporate  governance \nmeasures  by  the  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  will  be  critical  to  ensure  good \ngovernance  and  to  check  corrupt  practices  while  lending  to  SMEs  under  the  Project.  To \nminimize the inherent investment risks in lending to rural and nonurban SME projects, PFIs will \nneed  to  adhere  to  strict  internal  controls,  checks  and  balances,  and  risk  management \n ", "    Appendix 13       65     \nprocedures. The regulatory and supervisory role of Bangladesh Bank over the PFIs will be \nequally important to ensure corruption-free business practices.  \n \nD.  Recommendations \n \n12.  To enhance the design and implementation of the Project, it is recommended to \n(i)  incorporate good governance and anticorruption provisions in loan assurances, \n(ii)  obtain stakeholder concurrence with governance and corruption risk mitigation \nstrategies,  \n(iii)  acquire information during review missions on revised structures and processes \nwithin the Project to assess progress in managing governance and corruption \nrisks, and \n(iv)  revisit this assessment at a suitable opportunity in the project period to assess \nhow  conditions  may  have  been  more  (or  less)  favorable  for  effective \nimplementation. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090826143743+08'00'", "Subject": "Report and Recommendation of the President  to the Board of Directors", "Author": "MP6", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "small medium-sized enterprises, SME development project, SME sector bangladesh, bangladeshi women-led SMEs, SMESDP bangladesh, adb loan 2549, adb project 36200", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090930160816+08'00'", "Title": "Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Project "}, "author_page": " \nVice-President  X.
