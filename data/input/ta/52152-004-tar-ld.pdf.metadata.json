Background and Objectives \n \n1.  In  pursuit  of  its  goal  to  achieve  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic  growth,  the \nGovernment of Indonesia (the government) has initiated an ambitious infrastructure development \nagenda designed to boost productivity and provide access to economic opportunities and basic \npublic services across the archipelago. To support this agenda, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has prioritized meeting the government\u2019s infrastructure development goals in its country \npartnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  Indonesia.  The  TA  0040-INO:  Sustainable  Infrastructure \nAssistance Program Phase II (SIAP2), funded by the Government of Australia on a grant basis \nand under full administration of ADB, support effective identification, preparation, implementation, \nand financing of infrastructure projects, building on the successes and lessons learned from SIAP \nPhase I (SIAP1).  \n \n2.  The government is implementing the Loan 3455-INO: Accelerating Infrastructure Delivery \nthrough  Better  Engineering  Services  Project  (ESP)  that  will  help  meet  the  infrastructure \ndevelopment of the government that is financed by ADB and the government. Directorate General \nof Highways (DGH), the implementing agency, will engage qualified consulting firms to provide \nrange of project preparation services for DGH\u2019s public investment the roads, bridges and highway \nsector.  \n \n3.
