The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  preparing  the  Railway \nDevelopment Project.1 ADB conducted a fact-finding mission in June\u2013July 2005, carried out an \ninitial poverty and social assessment and a rapid environmental assessment, and discussed \ntechnical and socioeconomic issues with representatives of the Government, Yunnan provincial \nand local governments, and the Ministry of Railways (MOR). An understanding was reached \nwith  the  Government  on  the  goals,  purpose,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The TA is included in ADB's country \nassistance program for 2005.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  PRC  has  experienced  sustained  rapid  economic  growth  since  market-oriented \neconomic reforms were introduced in 1978. This has resulted in a rapid increase in demand for \ntransportation. Passenger transport grew by 9.0% per year between 1978 to 2004 and freight \ntransport grew by 7.6% per year. Road traffic accounted for 53.7% of total passenger-kilometers \n(km) in 2004, followed by railways at 35.0%, civil aviation at 10.9%, and coastal and inland \nwaterways  at  0.4%.  The  modal  split  for  freight  ton-km  was  58.4%  for  coastal  and  inland \nwaterways, 28.9% for railways, 11.4% for roads, 1.2% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation. \n \n3.  Rapid economic growth led to high demand for railway transportation, which is the \nprimary mode for long-distance and bulk transport. Between 1978 and 2004, railway freight \ngrew from 535 billion ton-km to 1,929 billion ton-km, equivalent to an annual growth rate of \n5.1%. Passenger traffic grew at 6.6% annually, increasing from 109 billion passenger-km to \n571.2 billion passenger-km. At the end of 2004, the PRC\u2019s railway system comprised 74,400 \nroute-km. Despite such growth rates, railway capacity has lagged behind demand due to railway \nsystem constraints. Given the railway\u2019s important role in providing economic transportation, \nthese constraints\u2014if not removed\u2014will continue to adversely affect efficient economic growth.  \n \n4.  The  Government  adopted  an  aggressive  plan  to  improve  the  railway,  and  planned \nnetwork  extensions  and  construction  in  underserved  areas.  Government  policy  on  railway \ndevelopment is focused on (i) removing constraints and expanding the system, (ii) encouraging \nconstruction  of  joint-venture  local  railways  to  promote  local  economic  development, \n(iii) improving efficiency by using new technology and modern management tools in planning \nand  operation,  (iv)  reducing  operating  subsidies  through  appropriate  pricing  and \ncommercialization of services, (v) initiating institutional and structural reforms to increase MOR\u2019s \nautonomy and accountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure \nand related services.  \n \n5.  The  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identifies  transportation\u2014including  railway \ndevelopment\u2014as  a  priority.  The  plan envisages  (i)  constructing  6,000  km  of  new  lines  to \nprovide access to unserved areas\u2014to increase the network length to 75,000 route-km by 2005; \n(ii) constructing 3,000 km of double lines and electrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase \ncapacity; and (iii) increasing operating speeds on 5,000 km\u2014to reach high speeds on the total \nlength  of  15,000  km.  The  plan  envisages  a  total  investment  of  CNY350  billion,  including \nCNY270 billion for capital construction and CNY80 billion for rolling-stock acquisition for the \n                                                 \n1  Formerly called Yuxi\u2013Mengzi Railway Project. \n2  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 22 June 2005.  \n \n ", "2   \nrailway  sector.  Investments  in  capital  construction  for  the  railway  are  expected  to  reach \nCNY450 billion from 2003 to 2007. \n \n6.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan (until 2020), \nwhich  seeks  to  expand  the  railway  network  from  72,000  km  to  85,000  km  by  2010  and \n100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is identified as a major goal. Train speeds will be \nraised to over 200 km per hour on the trunk network by 2020. Priority will be given to the \ndevelopment of railways in unserved areas and regions, which lack transport and are less \ndeveloped. The route network length will increase by 16,000 km in the western region of the \nPRC, to reach a network length of 40,000 km by 2020. To improve operational efficiency, steps \nwill be taken to separate passenger and freight trains on key rail corridors.  \n \n7.  Japan is the major source of external financing in the PRC railway sector, followed by \nADB and the World Bank. Since 1979, Japan has provided about Y558 billion for 15 railway \nprojects to expand rail transportation capacity. Since 1984, the World Bank has provided 10 \nloans totaling over $2.4 billion for (i) nine national railway projects to expand railway capacity on \nhigh-priority  corridors,  modernize  system  wide  technology,  and  strengthen  institutional \ncapabilities; and (ii) one local railway project. ADB focused on the development of railways in \nless-developed inland provinces, to promote growth and reduce poverty. ADB provided 13 \nloans, totaling about $2.6 billion, to finance the construction of about 1,921 km of provincial \nrailways and 4,597 km of national railway projects. \n \n8.  ADB's operational strategy in the PRC focuses on (i) expanding the railway system in \nunserved, less-developed, and poor areas; (ii) modernizing and increasing the capacity of key \nnational  railway  system  routes  to  improve  transport  efficiency;  (iii)  commercializing  railway \noperations to sustain efficient operations; and (iv) increasing railway competitiveness in the \ntransport sector through restructuring and policy reform. The strategy will continue to focus on \nrailway  development  in  underserved  areas  in  poor  interior  provinces,  to  link  lower-income \nregions with growth centers and facilitate pro-poor growth. Policy issues addressed include \ncorporatization,  marketing  and  business  development,  and  tariff-setting  with  improved  cost \nrecovery.  ADB  enhanced  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  and  is  providing  technical  assistance \nsupport for MOR policy reforms.3 This consultation will continue to further reforms in the sector.  \n \n9.  The Project envisages the construction of 141 km of Class I electrified railway line and \n13 new  railway  stations,  with  subgrades,  bridges,  and  tunnels.  Tunnels  and  bridges  will \ncomprise 51.5% of the route length because of hills along the Yuxi-Mengzi railway route. The \nrailway will cross Yunnan province from Yuxi running southward through the Yuxi district and \nHonghe prefecture to Mengzi in the southwest. The project area includes two cities and three \ncounties with a total population of about 3.56 million in Yuxi city, Tonghai county, Jianshui \ncounty, Geiju city, and Mengzi county. The total rural population is about 2.8 million\u2014about \n0.44 million (15.7%) live below the poverty line, including inhabitants in 259 poverty villages that \ndo not have access to highway (65 villages), electricity (17 villages), telephone (78 villages), \nand good drinking water (440 villages). In the project area, 34.1% of inhabitants are from ethnic \nminorities\u2014mainly Yi, Hani, Dai, Hui, and Meng, with smaller concentrations of Miao and Lago. \nThe proposed railway project will directly benefit a significant number of the poor, especially \nthrough  the  construction  of  13  new  railway  stations.  The  proposed  Project  will  cause \nresettlement due to the requirements of the new alignment and construction of new railway \nstations. Total land acquisition area is estimated at 617.3 hectares (ha) of permanent land and \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2004.

In addition, the Project will displace 55,105 square meters (m2) of \nstructures and relocate 460 households.4 \n \n10.  The  rationale  for  the  Project  reflects  the  need  to  (i)  develop  the  railway  network; \n(ii) enhance capacity; (iii) enhance regional cooperation; (iv) reduce energy consumption and \nenvironmental pollution; (v) meet the needs of the new railway development plan and the \nwestern region development strategy; and (vi) promote pro-poor economic growth along the line \nand in the region. The proposed railway line will connect with the Kunming-Chengdu, Kunming-\nGuiyang, Kunming-Nanning, Kunming-Neijiang main lines, and Kunming-Lijiang5 through the \nKunming-Kunyang-Yuxi railway line in the north and Mengzi-Hekou in the south, to the LaoCai-\nHanoi-Ho Chi Minh city and Haiphong port in Viet Nam. This line extends northward to Chengdu \nand Nanning, connecting with the Chen-Kun and Nan-Kun routes; and westward to Hekou to \nconnect with the Kun-Hue line. The existing meter gauge Kun-Hue railway line built in 1903 is in \npoor  condition  and  cannot  meet  existing  traffic  demand, so  capacity  must  be  added.  The \nexisting highway runs between Kunming and Mengzi only.  \n \n11.  Once completed, the connection will provide the shortest link from Kunming to Hekou \nand connect to the proposed pan-Asian railway to Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, \nand Singapore. The Project will provide access to Haiphong port in Viet Nam6, and South and \nSoutheast Asia\u2014promoting regional cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion. The railway \nis the most energy efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transport and is at least six \ntimes more fuel-efficient than the best mode of road transport. The electric line will have small \nenergy requirements and cause minimal environmental pollution. The proposed Project will be a \njoint-venture  railway  project,  with  equity  participation  from  MOR  and  Yunnan  provincial \ngovernment. \n \n12.  The  project  area  has  large  mineral  reserves  and  is  rich  in  food  grains  and  forest \nproduce. It has chemical, engineering, cement, and manufacturing industries and a number of \ntourist sites. The proposed railway will pass through an alignment area that has remained cut off \nfrom mainstream development, due to lack of transportation and its remote location. Poor \naccessibility and lack of economic transport impeded economic growth in the resource rich area. \nThe region has many tourist spots and potential is enormous. This can be maximized with the \ndevelopment of the railway line, as the line will provide much-needed economic, reliable, and \nsafe transport. The provincial and local governments and people living in the project area view \nthe  railway  as  a  key  investment\u2014crucial  to  create  employment  and  income-generating \nactivities\u2014and a prerequisite for reducing poverty.  \n \n13.  The proposed railway will carry both passenger and freight traffic and help develop the \nrailroad network in an unserved area. It is included in MOR\u2019s updated Tenth Five-Year Plan, as \nwell  as  the  railway  development  plan,  and  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  western  region \ndevelopment strategy. By the year 2012 and 2020, the project railway is expected to carry 7 \nmillion tons of freight and 1.3 million passengers, and 9 million tons of freight and 1.7 million \npassengers, respectively. This will facilitate economic development and integration of the poor \nwestern region; and stimulate industrial and natural resources development, and tourism and \nrelated industries. It will also increase local people\u2019s access to market and social services, and \nallow them to improve their standard of living. ADB-financed railway projects show that such \n                                                 \n4  These estimates are preliminary and will be revised during the project preparatory TA. \n5  Part of this is financed by ADB under ADB. 2004.

The railway will offer more affordable, reliable, and punctual transport. The \nProject is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy and will support the Government\u2019s \nstrategic policy objective of greater developmental emphasis on poor, interior, and underserved \nareas of the PRC by improving transport links with growth centers. \n \n14.  The  National  Development  Reforms  Commission  approved  the  project  proposal  on \n25 February  2005.  MOR  has  prepared  a  feasibility  study  with  cost  estimates  and  traffic \nforecasts. The Yunnan provincial government has established a project leading group and \nconfirmed that all cities/counties to be affected by resettlement have implemented locally-funded \nprojects involving resettlement. Resettlement under the Project will be implemented according \nto national laws, provincial regulations, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \n \n15.  ADB has pursued the introduction of operational reforms and enhanced railway safety \nwith MOR, which is in a transition phase and is upgrading its technology and systems. It is \nadopting high-speed passenger train and heavy load freight train operation systems. These \ndevelopments  require  an  urgent  comprehensive  approach  to  safety  development  on  PRC \nrailways. ADB is supporting a separate additional project component to promote sustainable \nsafety systems, and help MOR modernize and upgrade its existing management systems and \ntechnology to meet current and future requirements of safe, reliable train operation. MOR is \npreparing a draft feasibility study detailing the rationale, objective, scope and components, cost \nestimates, and monitoring indicators for this component.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The  TA  aims  to  (i)  assist  the  Government  in  reviewing  and  strengthening  the  two \nfeasibility  studies,  EIA,  resettlement  plan,  and  related  studies  to  meet  ADB's  financing \nrequirements;  (ii)  identify  policy  measures  and  institutional  development  needs  to  improve \nrailway safety, operational efficiency and management, and ensure financial sustainability of \noperations; and (iii) identify social dimensions to be incorporated in project design (including \nmeasures to enhance social development and reduce poverty in the project area). The outcome \nwill be the design of a project suitable for ADB financing.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n17.  The  TA  will  (i)  review  and  strengthen  the  two  feasibility  studies  to  meet  ADB \nrequirements  for  (a)  technical  aspects  (railway  safety,  construction,  and  operation); \n(b) economic and financial analyses (including a review of the traffic forecast and financial \nperformance of project facility operations); and (c) financial management assessment (including \na review of budgetary and planning control, financial and management accounting, and internal \ncontrol and audit systems); (ii) develop a set of verifiable performance indicators (including \nsocioeconomic and poverty) and a sustainable monitoring mechanism for during and after \nconstruction; (iii) recommend policy measures to improve railway safety, enhance operational \nefficiency  and  management,  and  assess  specific  institutional  development  needs  to \n                                                 \n7  In the ADB-financed Daxian\u2013Waxian Railway Project, the average net income along the proposed alignment of the \nrailway increased by 25% in real terms during the construction period. The average real increase in Chongqing for \nthe same period was approximately 10%. Education is often the first spending priority for families. Increased \nincome has reportedly led some poor people out of debt for the next generation\u2019s education. \n ", "    5 \ncommercially  operate  the  project  facilities  and  ensure  financial  sustainability;  (iv)  review \npotential  for  private  sector  participation  in  construction,  provision  of  services,  and  tourism \ndevelopment;  (v)  review  and  update  EIA  and  prepare  a  summary  EIA  with  appropriate \nenvironmental monitoring and management plans; (vi) review and refine the resettlement plan to \nensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and relevant operations \nmanuals; (vii) review the initial poverty and social assessment; carry out a detailed poverty, \nsocial and gender analysis (including a baseline gender-disaggregated socioeconomic profile of \nproject  area  inhabitants);  and  prepare  relevant  mitigation  and  enhancement  measures \n(Appendix  2);  (viii) prepare  a  development  plan  for  ethnic  minorities,  according  to  ADB \nguidelines; and (ix) undertake distribution analysis of the Project and associated developments \non poverty reduction (including poverty impact). Key activities are field surveys; document \nreview;  data  analysis;  and  consultations  with  stakeholders  (including  government  officials, \nproject beneficiaries, and project-affected people\u2014ethnic minorities, women, and the poor).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $670,000 equivalent, comprising $376,000 in foreign \nexchange and $294,000 equivalent in local currency costs (Appendix 3). The Government \nrequested that ADB finance $500,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$124,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  MOR  will  provide  the  remaining  $170,000  equivalent  in  local \ncurrency  cost  for  counterpart  staff  members,  office  facilities,  support  services,  and  local \ncommunications. The Government and MOR have been informed that approval of the TA does \nnot commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  MOR will be the Executing Agency, with responsibility for supervising and monitoring TA \nactivities. The Government and MOR agreed to provide assistance for the TA. MOR will make \navailable (i) all relevant reports, studies, and information; (ii) suitable office accommodation and \nappropriate  and  qualified  counterpart  staff;  (iii)  local  transport  facilities;  and  (iv)  any  other \nassistance that the consultants may reasonably request (including liaison with the Government \nand local authorities). \n \n20.  The TA will require about 39 person-months of consulting services (16 international and \nabout  23  domestic),  including  fieldwork.  The TA  will  be implemented  over  5  months  from \nJanuary to July 2006. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Recruitment of consultants will follow the quality- and cost-based selection method, \nand  simplified  technical  proposals  will  be  required.  The  international  consultants  will  have \nexpertise in transport economics, financial analysis, railway safety, railway engineering and \noperation, institution building, environment, resettlement and social poverty analysis. Expertise \nrequired form domestic consultants will be in the fields of transport economics, railway safety, \nrailway  engineering  and  operation,  environment,  resettlement  and  social  poverty  analysis. \nAppendix 4 gives the outline terms of reference for consulting services. The consultants will \nprocure equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.
