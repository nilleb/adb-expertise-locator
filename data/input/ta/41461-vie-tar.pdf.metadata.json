Following  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Sector  Project \n(RISP), the Government of Viet Nam (the Government) requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to prepare an investment project for sustainable rural \ninfrastructure development in the 15 provinces of the northern mountain region.1 The TA is \nincluded as a firm project in the ADB\u2019s TA pipeline for 2008. A TA Fact-Finding Mission was \nfielded  in  June  2008  to  develop  and  agree  on  the  scope  of  work  and  implementation \narrangements. A preliminary design and monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1 and \nan initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s recent socioeconomic development progress has been remarkable. It has \nmade significant strides in poverty reduction in recent years. The country\u2019s success in reducing \noverall poverty incidence by almost two thirds in just 11 years is unprecedented. Poverty was \ncut from 58.1% in 1993 to 23.2% in 2004. During this period, income per capita has grown from \n$288  to  $622,  with  a  modest  increase  in  income  disparities.  Broad\u2013based  and  vigorous \neconomic  growth,  greater  macroeconomic  and  political  stability,  and  targeted  programs  to \nprovide basic public infrastructure and services to vulnerable groups have all helped reduce \npoverty. Poverty reduction has been underpinned by rapid, stable, and inclusive economic \ngrowth, following Viet Nam\u2019s steady transition from central planning to a socialist\u2013oriented \nmarket  economic  system.  Sustained  agricultural  growth  of  nearly  4%  in  the  past  decade, \nresulting from reforms and improved incentives, was pivotal in reducing poverty in the early \nstages of reforms. More recently, rapid growth in private sector investment has generated \nsubstantial new jobs in industry and the services. A key factor in Viet Nam\u2019s success in reducing \npoverty levels has been its investments in infrastructure.2 Between 1997 and 2004, about 44% \nof total state investments were directed to infrastructure.3 \n3.  However, challenges still remain. Persistent poverty in the northern mountain region and \nwithin ethnic minority communities, which often comprise remote communes, pose serious \nchallenges to the Government\u2019s efforts aimed at poverty reduction in the country. The northern \nmountain region has poverty levels which are much higher than the national average, with 44% \nof the region\u2019s total population of about 12 million living below the poverty line in 2004.4 In the \nsame year, the northeast portion of the mountainous region had 29.2% of its population living \nbelow the poverty line while the northwest portion of the aforementioned region had 51.9% of its \npopulation  living  below  the  poverty  line.  Aside  from  regional  inequality,  there  are  serious \nchallenges of high levels of poverty among ethnic minorities, as compared to the Kinh and \nChinese population groups. Ethnic minorities, while constituting only 13% of Viet Nam\u2019s total \npopulation, account for about 39% of the country\u2019s poor. In the northern mountain region, \nwhere ethnic minorities account for more than 50% of the population, poverty and food \ninsecurity persist on account of low agricultural production and incomes, and limited off\u2013\nfarm employment opportunities caused by poor infrastructural development. \n4.  The lack of infrastructure is recognized as a major reason for the high rate of poverty in \nthe rural and remote isolated localities, especially among ethnic minorities. The availability of \n                                                 \n1 The 15 provinces of northern mountain region include: Vinh Phuc, Phu Tho, Tuyen Quang, Ha Giang, Yen Bai, Lao \nCai, Lai Chau, Dien Bien, Son La, Hoa Binh, Thai Nguyen, Cao Bang, Bac Kan, Bac Giang, Lang Son.

Ha Noi (percentage of poverty \nhouseholds by area and region). \n ", "2   \n \nkey rural infrastructure is rather limited in the northern mountain region when compared with \nnational averages. Only about 7.7% of the total agricultural area in the northeastern part and \napproximately  23.0%  northwestern  part  of  the  northern  mountain  region  were  under \nirrigation in 2004. Access to clean water and sanitation for ethnic minorities is limited with \nonly 19% having access to clean water by 2004 compared to 36% for the Kinh and Hoa \ngroups. Access to sanitation is even more limited for ethnic minorities, 4% of whom had \naccess to sanitation as compared to 36% among the Kinh and Hoa groups.5  \n5.  In the northern mountain region, there are resources and opportunities, as well as \nconstraints and vulnerabilities in the task of poverty reduction. The northern mountain region,  \nwhich covers an area of about 11.6 million hectares (ha), is richly endowed with valuable natural \nresources, including forests, national parks, and nature reserves; a proliferation of rivers and \nstreams  with  extensive  watersheds  that  provide  much-needed  water  for  irrigation  and \nhydropower generation for the country; and a rich agricultural land base. The northern mountain \nregion also holds significant potential for ecotourism given the presence of historical and cultural \nsuites, and national parks and protected areas. The region possesses unique resources such as \nancient tea trees and non-timber forest products, which can be exploited in environmentally-\nfriendly ways.  Ecotourism and private sector investments can create jobs and raise incomes. \n6.  The northern mountain region is also strategically located, with access to international \nborders, and regional and sub-regional markets. In such a region, opportunities for increasing \nemployment and incomes through trade and value\u2013adding can be harnessed by improving \nconnectivity  between  production  centers  and  subregional  and  domestic  markets.  Improved \ncommunication links with the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), by linkages to the upcoming \nKunming Haiphong Highway for instance, will help the mountain provinces to increase their \ntrade, ecotourism and marketing links with the countries of the GMS. \n7.  Although there is an extensive network of rural roads, in their present condition these \nroads cannot contribute to the realization of socioeconomic transformation. The absence of \nall\u2013weather access roads constrains realization of the potential for development of agriculture, \nagro\u2013industries, and ecotourism in these mountainous areas. In addition, the conditions of \nirrigation systems that could potentially raise crop production to its full potential have become \ndegraded over time. Consequently, farmers are left with no choice but to grow only a single \nrain\u2013fed crop of paddy every year. Improved irrigation could increase food production and \nmarketable surplus and raise rural income, thereby moving residents of the northern mountain \nregion out of poverty.   \n8.  The region is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and frequent natural \ndisasters. While  offering  opportunities  for  growth  through  improved  rural  infrastructure,  the \nregion highlights the fragility of such investments in the face of natural disasters. Climate \nchange is making ordinary climatic events much more severe and devastating. An assessment \nof the vulnerability of rural infrastructure to climate change\u2013related damage, which potentially \nposes a serious threat to its useful life and sustainability, would help establish prevention and \nmitigation  measures  at  the  design  and  construction  stage.  Design  of  environmentally \nappropriate rural infrastructure and conservation-oriented farming practices are some of the \nactions that may be warranted as climate change adaptation measures.6  \n \n                                                 \n5  Viet Nam: Vietnamese Academy of Social Sciences. 2006.  Viet Nam poverty Update Report 2006: Poverty and \nPoverty Reduction in Viet Nam 1993-2004. Hanoi.  \n6  In the assessment of climate change-related vulnerability and risk analysis, ADB\u2019s Greater Mekong Subregion \nenvironment operations center (EOC) can provide the necessary technical support.  \n ", " 3 \n9.  Another constraint to socioeconomic development relates to capacity limitations at the \ncentral, provincial, and lower levels of government. In addition, funding constraints of the poorer \nprovinces for operation and maintenance (O&M) of rural infrastructure need to be addressed to \nensure  sustainability  of  infrastructure  projects.  Capacity  building  for  participatory  planning, \nimproved targeting, and addressing key O&M requirements will help address such constraints \nand enable the Government to deliver effectively on its poverty reduction plans.   \n10.  The Government is aware of the problems posed by the persistence of poverty and \nhunger among ethnic minority populations in the northern mountain region. In its Five\u2013Year \nSocio\u2013Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010, the Government enunciated its goals \nof rapid socioeconomic development for the northern mountain region, with respect to hunger \neradication and poverty reduction, and reduced economic disparities across regions and among \nethnic  groups.  For  the  northern  mountain  region  in  particular,  the  SEDP  targets  a  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita of $460\u2013$530 by 2010, as compared to $250\u2013$300 in \n2008.7  The  SEDP  identifies  a  clear  role  for  rural  transport,  water  supply  and  other  rural \ninfrastructure in support of various sector objectives, by using the government budgets to focus \non critical areas (e.g., irrigation, transport, and clean water supply) as means to agriculture and \nrural development and fundamental to transformation of production structures.  \n11.   There are valuable lessons to be learned regarding rural infrastructure\u2013led development \nin Viet Nam, from projects and programs implemented by the Government, and/or assisted by \ndevelopment partners. Among others, the World Bank\u2019s Northern Mountains Poverty Reduction \nProject, implemented in 6 of the region\u2019s 15 mountain provinces, and ADB\u2019s Rural Infrastructure \nSector Project (RISP), which covered 23 provinces across the country, provide valuable lessons \nfor  the  proposed  Project.8  Lessons  from  the  World  Bank  project  include  (a)  the  need  for \nflexibility in applying government and development partner procedures in the preparation of \nsubproject  proposals  and  during  project  management  and  coordination;  (b)  community \nparticipation in commune development budget provisions for identifying potential investments \naimed at addressing both the practical and strategic needs of the community; (c) need to \ndevelop  a  management  information  system  for  project  management  and  monitoring;  (d) \ncapacity development and harmonized procedures for safeguard policies; and (e) arrangements \nfor sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M).  \n12.  The  ADB  assisted  RISP,  which  supported  rural  infrastructure  improvements  in  23 \nprovinces in the country (including several mountain provinces), demonstrates that improved \naccess to rural infrastructure is an effective means of improving livelihoods and living conditions, \nand reducing rural poverty. The lessons from the RISP, to those of the World Bank assisted \nproject, highlight the importance of the following: (i) an integrated investment approach to \naddress the development needs of poor communities more effectively; (ii) active beneficiary \nparticipation in all aspects of subproject design and implementation; (iii) appropriate technical, \ninstitutional, and financial arrangements for each type of infrastructure; (iv) coordination among \nconcerned provincial institutions; (v) compliance with safeguard policies; (vi) an adequate O&M \nbudget; and (vii) the importance of ensuring the availability of productive resources and support \nservices to enable target groups to increase their productivity and utilize rural infrastructure to its \nfull potential.

ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  Viet  Nam  (2007\u20132010)  recognizes  the \nincreasing complexity of poverty in the northern mountain provinces, as well as the need for \npromoting national investments to support sub-regional development.10 In this context, the \ndevelopment  of  GMS  economic  corridors,  such  as  the  Kunming\u2013Hai  Phong  Expressway, \nassumes special significance given the strategic location of the northern mountain region.  \n14.  As envisaged in the country strategy and program, SEDP, and associated provincial \nmaster plans, there is a need to increase agricultural production and enhance the marketability \nof local produce to reduce poverty in the region. Investments for upgrading rural infrastructure \nare critical to facilitating equitable socioeconomic development and enhancing the well-being of \npoor ethnic minorities. Given the widely-dispersed nature of rural infrastructure investments in \nthe northern mountain region, the scale of investments needed, past experience and lessons, \nthe  need  to  complement  other  development  partners\u2019  efforts  and  avoid  overlap,  and  the \ndesirability of focusing on the priority needs of the provinces, a sector approach is proposed for \nthe TA. Such an approach can help the Government achieve its socioeconomic development \ngoals in the sector through project-related investments in a well defined geographical area.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The  impact  of  the  ensuing  project  will  be  enhanced  connectivity  between  isolated \ncommunes and districts, and better access for ethnic minorities to markets and social services.  \nThe outcome will be an investment proposal for a sector development project agreed to by the \nGovernment. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will adopt a sequenced approach in its implementation. In the first phase, the TA \nwill undertake sector assessment and institutional diagnostics for the area. It will (i) review the \nGovernment\u2019s sector plans at the national and provincial levels for all 15 mountain provinces; (ii) \nreview other development partners\u2019 plans for investments in the region; (iii) review past rural \ninfrastructure  investments  and  their  lessons,  and  the  supporting  policy  and  regulatory \nenvironment  with  a  view  to  sustainability,  support  for  O&M,  and  key  elements  of  sector \nexpenditures;  and  (iv)  analyze  how  these  factors  are  reflected  in  the  commitments  and \ncapacities  of  the  national  and  local  government  agencies  to  finance  and  implement  rural \ninfrastructure  programs.  The  sector  assessment  will  include  an  institutional  assessment\u2014\nincluding analysis of financial and information flows, governance systems including internal \nprocesses defining roles and accountabilities, policies and standards and associated processes \nfor  project  management  and  accountability,  technical  and  administrative  capacity\u2014and \nincentives  and  performance  of  existing  institutions  at  various  levels.  Based  on  the  sector \nassessment, social state of beneficiaries, and other relevant investments planned in the project \nprovinces, the TA will prepare practical subproject selection criteria and a medium\u2013term rural \ninfrastructure development plan for each participating province that draws on the respective \n                                                 \n9  Government of Vietnam, Ministry of Labor, Invalids, Social Affairs, and United Nations Development Programme. \n2004.

The second phase will include the preparation of a feasibility study for the ensuing \nProject and detailed feasibility studies for four core subprojects based on detailed planning for \nthese,  for  agreed\u2013upon  investment  options,  and  various  frameworks  for  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards compliance documents that satisfy the standard requirements of both \nthe Government and ADB. In addition, a list of non-core subprojects will be prepared based on \nagreed-upon selection criteria.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.20 million equivalent. ADB will provide $1.0 million to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment, through the concerned agencies, will provide cash and in-kind contributions of \n$200,000 equivalent. The detailed cost estimates and proposed financing plan are in Appendix \n3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the TA will be the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment (MARD), which will assume overall responsibility for TA implementation. A project \npreparation unit under the Agriculture Projects Management Board and reporting to the vice\u2013\nminister of MARD will ensure smooth implementation. Each project province will appoint its \nrespective Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for TA implementation at the \nprovince\u2013level. Provincial project preparation units with qualified counterpart staff will provide \noffice accommodation and logistical support. ADB will administer the TA. \n20.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 9 months from January 2009 to September \n2009. An input of approximately 30 person\u2013months of international consulting services and 60 \nperson\u2013months of national consulting services are envisaged. The consultants' team will be led \nby an international rural infrastructure development specialist (economist), who will be assisted \nby a national deputy with similar expertise. Consultants will be engaged through a firm in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime)  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  consultants  following  the \nquality\u2013  and  cost\u2013based  selection  procedure.  Appendix  4  provides  the  outline  terms  of \nreference. Procurement of goods will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (as amended from time to time). Equipment procured under the TA will be handed \nover to the Government upon TA completion.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nRural development is one of the top priorities of the Government of Viet Nam to reduce poverty and promote \nequitable growth in remote and disadvantaged areas.a While Viet Nam as a whole has made remarkable strides in \npoverty reduction (19% of the total population was below poverty in 2007 as compared with 58% in 1993), the \nnorthern mountain region is characterized by persistent high levels of poverty (58% in 2007). The northern \nmountain region is emerging as one of the poorest regions in the country, and a lack of rural infrastructure is \nidentified as a major factor leading to such persistent poverty. A lack of access to irrigation limits crop \nproduction and leads to food insecurity and low incomes. This is further exacerbated by a lack of access to markets \nand commune as well as district centers, where better prices and production-related information and services are \navailable. In addition, a lack of safe water and sanitation increases women and girls\u2019 domestic workload, and leads \nto persistent morbidity and reduced time for productive activities and education. These are the conditions in the \nmountainous regions of northern Viet Nam, where ethnic minorities reside in remote areas that lack basic \namenities. They suffer from high levels of poverty and deprivation, leading to low incomes and low levels of \neducation and healthcare. The Government of Viet Nam recognizes the constraints to creating balanced \ngrowth  and  achieving  comprehensive  poverty  reduction  in  communes  located  in  challenging  physical \nenvironments that lack adequate rural infrastructure, economic opportunities, and social services (footnote a). \nAccordingly,  the  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP  2006\u20132010)  of  the  Government  accords \nimportance  to  the  development  of  rural  infrastructure  in  remote  areas  to  achieve  sustainable  poverty \nreduction. The provision of rural roads, irrigation, water supply, sanitation services, and access to rural \nmarkets are accorded high priority. The ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (2007\u20132010) also recognizes the \ncomplexity of poverty in the northern mountain region and the need to provide assistance to selected \nprovinces to reduce persistent poverty and improve social equity.b Rural infrastructure is recognized as an \nimportant area for development if poverty is to be reduced in such physically-challenging locations.  \n \nIn view of its priorities to address persistent poverty and food insecurity among ethnic minorities and the poor \nin the northern mountain provinces, the Government has requested ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) \nto develop an investment project for sustainable rural infrastructure development. The TA and the ensuing loan \nare included as firm projects in the TA and lending pipeline of ADB. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, \nM2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification: The project will be a sector type modality, leading to sub \nprojects in selected priority districts of the 15 northern mountain provinces. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence?  Resources have been allocated for consulting \nservices for poverty and social assessments as well as compliance with other safeguards policies. As the \ndesign of the ensuing project is expected to be a community-driven development (CDD) type project, \nresources are allocated in the TA for CDD specialization, stakeholder workshops, and a CDD workshop in \nThe viTeuwyse ne xQpuraensgs epdro vhienrceei.n  are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmember s, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-\npoor governance, and pro-poor growth)? \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project?  \nThe potential beneficiaries of the Project are ethnic minority communities who live in remote mountainous \ncommunes in the 15 provinces of the northern mountain region. These communes are characterized by a lack of \nyear-round access to roads, poor state of irrigation services, and lack of safe water and sanitation. All of these \nfactors constrain the efforts of the Government and the ethnic minority communities themselves to improve their \nlives. While average productivity is not low, a lack of irrigation forces these communities to produce a single crop \nof rice, which is highly inadequate for their household food security. As such, they are forced to migrate in search \nof work and undertake shifting cultivation in hazardous locations. By providing irrigation, crop productivity and \nproduction can rise significantly, leading to both food security and marketable surpluses. Through better road \naccess, farmers can bring their perishable goods to markets in a timely manner and transport larger quantities of \ngrain and other produce to markets in cheaper and more efficient ways. By having access to safe water and \nsanitation, women and girls will have a less-exhausting schedule and be able to participate in productive \nactivities, education, and recreation. As a result, the socially excluded, including women and girls, and members \nof poor ethnic minority communities can improve their livelihoods and quality of life. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project?  \nBeneficiary needs include improved all-weather communications and market development to access markets, \ninvestments, extension services for enabling diversification of local economies, irrigation to improve their crop \nproduction, and a safe water supply and sanitation services for a better quality of life.  \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them?  \nPotential constraints lie in the lack of capacity of provinces, districts, and communes to apply bottom-up planning \nand  implementation  using  community-driven  development  (CDD).  Ethnic  minority  communities  may  be \nconstrained from participating  on  account of patterns  of exclusion and  poor Vietnamese  language skills, \nespecially among women. The Project will provide training for local government staff and other stakeholders in \nCDD.  It  will  also  use  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  working  with  remote  and  ethnic  minority \ncommunities to build links with them and facilitate their sustained participation. Language-related support will be \nprovided as needed through adult literacy and interpretation services. Communities will be supported to organize \nfor improved participation in decision-making, planning, and execution and supervision of subproject activities. \nProject monitoring will be participatory in nature. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.   Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. These include central and provincial, district and commune \ngovernments, participating communities, CSOs, development partners among others. \n2.   What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops, community mobilization, involvement of nongovernmental organizations and community-based \norganizations, etc.)? Community mobilization, stakeholder workshops, CSO participation. \n3.

Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.    What are the key gender issues in the sector/sub sector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nGender issues relate mainly to the lack of ethnic minority women\u2019s participation in decision-making and the \narduous nature of domestic work. It will be important to provide ethnic minority women in particular, and all \nwomen in target communities, the opportunities and resources they require to participate in an informed \nmanner in the design, prioritization, implementation, and operation and maintenance of the subprojects to be \nundertaken.  \n2.   Does  the  proposed  project/program  have  the  potential  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?       Yes          No    Please explain. A Gender and Development action \nplan will be prepared. \n3.   Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?       \n          Yes          No    Please explain  \n ", "Appendix 2   13\n \nIII.
