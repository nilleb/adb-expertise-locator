Following a request from the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam (the \nGovernment) for a technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Central Region Small and Medium \nTowns Development Project, an Asian Development Bank (ADB) fact-finding mission visited \nViet Nam, on 18\u201328 October 2004.1 The mission consulted with representatives of the Ministry \nof Construction (MOC), the State Bank of Viet Nam, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance,  as  well  as  representatives  of  the  provincial  and  district  people\u2019s \ncommittees (PPCs and DPCs) in Khanh Hoa, Ninh Thuan, and Phu Yen provinces, which are \nwithin  the  likely  project  area.  The  mission  also  met  with  representatives  of  the  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), which has expressed initial interest in cofinancing the \nProject. Based on these discussions and field visits to the three provinces, the mission reached \nan understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, \nand implementation arrangements of the project preparatory TA, and the terms of reference for \nthe consultants.2 The preliminary project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n2.  Since the late 1980s, Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth has been impressive. Between 1992 \nand 2002, the poverty level decreased from around 54% to 29%.3 The engines of growth have \nbeen the urban centers, as highlighted by the growth of the industry and services sectors, which \nposted respective rates of 9.4% and 6.5% for 2001, and 8.9% and 6.0% for 2002. This extended \nperiod of high growth in the urban centers, however, has not been matched by investments in \ninfrastructure, particularly in the small and medium towns. Despite government support for \nurban  development,  prolonged  periods  of  fiscal  deficits  have  restricted  the  investments \nnecessary to improve the quality of life for the urban population. \n \n3.  As Viet Nam\u2019s Millennium Development Goals and Targets emphasize the importance of \nimproving the quality of life and public health, and, at the same time, promoting sustainable \neconomic growth, the Government has attributed a high priority to water supply and sanitation \n(WSS) and considers these as strategic urban investments. The Government\u2019s development \nstrategies  and  policies  for  urban  water  supply  are  reflected  in  the  Orientation  Plan  for \nDevelopment of Water Supply to 2020, approved in March 1998. The geographic focus of the \nproposed project is the southern Central Region, one of the poorest regions in Viet Nam with \npoverty levels higher than the national average. The urban population in the region was about \n4.5 million in 2003 and is growing at an average annual rate of 4.7%.  \n \n4.  The mission\u2019s findings supported the Government\u2019s position that inadequate WSS were \nthe most pressing issues in the small and medium towns in the southern Central Region. \nSeasonal occurrences of flood and drought have plagued the region; the lack of investments \nand deteriorated conditions of urban WSS facilities have heightened environmental and health \nrisks and have inhibited the social and economic development of the region\u2019s small and medium \ntowns. Most towns have either inadequate or no water supply system at all, with a maximum \nservice coverage of 20%. A large proportion of the population uses water from contaminated or \nsaline wells and surface sources. Many residents purchase water for drinking and cooking from \nvendors or from residents connected to public water supplies, at extremely high prices, often 5\u2013\n                                                 \n1  The TA is included in the Viet Nam Country Strategy and Program Update, 2005\u20132006. \n2  The TA first appeared in  ADB Business Opportunities  (Internet edition) on 19 November 1998 under the title \n\u201cCentral Region Sustainable Urban Development.\u201d The last updated version was made on 6 November 2004. \n3  Respective figures by the World Bank and Viet Nam\u2019s General Statistics Office. ", "2  \n20 times existing tariffs for public water supply. On the supply side, problems of inadequate \nmanagement and lack of technical capacity have resulted in poor maintenance of the existing \nsystems, to the extent that most of them require replacement. \n \n5.  A severe lack of drainage was evident in all towns visited by the mission, which is clearly \nleading to problems of flooding and difficulties in accessibility. Surface drainage systems were \neither nonexistent or in serious need of repair, and environmental pollution resulting from waste \ndischarges  lead  to  serious  health  risks.  Solid  waste  collection  was  lacking  and  leads  to \nunsanitary  disposal,  indiscriminate  dumping,  and  contamination  of  the  general  urban \nenvironment.  Latrine  systems  (identified  as  septic  tanks)  have  open  bottom  pits,  which \ndischarge  wastewater  into  the  soil,  causing  serious  health  hazards  associated  with \ncontamination. Aside from the absence of sanitation facilities,  there is also a lack of health \nawareness and education among the urban poor.  \n \n6.  As most provinces and districts in the southern Central Region are net recipients of the \nnational government budget, they have limited financial resources for capital investments and \noperation and maintenance support. This has not only impeded development, but has also \nrestricted the ability of local authorities to build any degree of capacity in urban services \nmanagement. There is a need to provide a structured capacity-building program, support for the \nsustainability  of  improved  urban  services,  and  an  enhanced  sense  of  local  ownership  of \ninvestments.  \n \n7.  ADB  has  actively  assisted  Viet  Nam\u2019s  urban  and  WSS  sectors  since  1993,  with \nemphasis on new water supply systems, rehabilitation and extension of existing systems, \nenvironmental  and  infrastructure  improvements,  capacity  building,  and  institutional  reform. \nSince 1993, ADB has approved five loans totaling $304 million equivalent4 and provided several \nadvisory  TA  grants.  The  recommendations  resulting  from  these  interventions  have  been \naccepted by the Government and have helped develop the national water supply tariff policy, \nstrengthen water supply companies, and facilitate urban environmental improvements. Further \nefforts to improve WSS conditions will reduce poverty through improved health conditions, \nincreased time and cost savings for women who conveniently collect safe water for daily \nconsumption, and improved community and family hygiene. \n \n8.  Several lessons learned could be extracted from previous implementation experience. \nFirst is that, given the geographic length of the country\u20141,500 kilometers north to south\u2014the \ntowns to be supported by the Project should be clustered to facilitate effective administration \nand coordination during implementation. The TA will therefore cover towns in five contiguous \nprovinces of the southern Central Region, with poverty levels above the national average. \nSecond, there is a need to carefully prioritize investments. The TA will either refer to an existing \ninvestment plan or design one that will provide a framework for future development. The third \nlesson is that broad-based participation is essential to the success of any project. Participation \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1993.

Fourth, is that the effectiveness of PPCs, provincial water supply \ncompanies (PWCs), DPCs, urban environmental companies, and other stakeholders has been \nconstrained by the policy environment and limited capacity to provide adequate and sustainable \nWSS services in southern Central Region towns. A firm commitment from government at all \nlevels is needed to support reform efforts. Last is the importance of establishing a management \nframework that will systematically evaluate and monitor environmental, involuntary resettlement, \nand other social impacts to fully comply with safeguard policies and ensure sustainable WSS \ndevelopment.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The development goal of the Project under preparation is to reduce poverty and improve \nthe quality of life of the urban population in the target areas through sustainable improvements \nin WSS. The purpose of the TA is to prepare a pre-investment study and project design for \nsmall and medium towns in Viet Nam\u2019s southern Central Region. The objectives of the TA are to \n(i) identify socioeconomic, WSS, and water resource conditions and needs in the candidate \nproject towns; (ii) assess managerial, technical, and financial capacity of WSS providers as well \nas potential for broad-based participation; (iii) ensure that social and environmental safeguards \nare met; and (iv) prepare a project design suitable for sustainable WSS improvements of 10\u201320 \nsmall and medium town environments in five contiguous provinces in the southern Central \nRegion.5 TA outputs are: (i) a study for WSS development for southern central region small and \nmedium towns to include an inception, interim, draft final, and final report; (ii) social and \nenvironmental safeguard documents, (iii) a pre-investment study and design of WSS and WSS-\nrelated  components,  broad-based  participatory  activities,  and  capacity  building  of  WSS \nproviders and regulators, and (iv) downstream commitments to fund future implementation of \nthe  project.  The  design  will  include  physical  investments;  project  costs  and  financing \nmechanisms; operation and maintenance procedures; recommended policy, institutional, and \nregulatory reform; and managerial, technical, and financial capacity building. The TA will also \ndevelop WSS investment plans for the towns where no such plan exists.  \n \n10.  The mission discussed with MOC several components to be considered for project \npreparation. These include water supply development, sanitation infrastructure improvements, \npublic awareness and health education programs, and implementation assistance and capacity \nbuilding. The water supply development component will propose new water supply systems, \nrehabilitation and further extensions of existing systems, and community-based water supply \nsystems where appropriate. Sanitation improvements will comprise drainage, sewage disposal, \nand solid waste management. Public awareness programs will engage mass organizations such \nas women\u2019s and youth unions to educate the public regarding good health practices, conduct \ncleanliness campaigns, and engage communities in collective activities that encourage broad-\nbased participation for the operation and maintenance of investments. A strong emphasis will be \nplaced on strengthening the managerial, technical, and financial capacities of PWCs, urban \nenvironmental corporations, PPCs, and DPCs to ensure sustainability of WSS facilities after \nproject completion, and strengthening the Viet Nam Water Supply and Sewerage Association to \n                                                 \n5  The number of towns could be expanded to up to 20, depending on the cost of subproject components and on the \navailability of cofinancing. Final selection will be based on predetermined criteria to include (i) poverty level, \n(ii) need  for  assistance,  (iii) commitment  and  capacity  of  the  PPC/DPC,  (iv) compatibility  with  the  agreed \ngeographic focus, (v) existence of a master plan, and (vi) no previous ADB assistance in the sector. \n ", "4  \nenable it to perform its function as a regulatory body. In addition, policy, institutional, and \nregulatory  amendments  to  the  existing  frameworks  will  be  undertaken  for  further  sector \ndevelopment. An analysis of cost recovery through improved tariffs, as well as the potential for \nprivate sector participation, will also be explored.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will conduct a review of the WSS sector, including lessons learned from previous \nprojects assisted by ADB, the Government, and development partners. An assessment of the \ncurrent level of WSS services and water resources, as well as institutional, policy, and human \nresource conditions will be made to identify opportunities and constraints facing WSS sector \ndevelopment in the project towns. Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, focus \ngroup  discussions,  and  secondary  data  sources  to  assess  WSS  needs  and  potential  for \ncommunity  participation  and  private  sector  involvement.  Surveys  will  be  targeted  at  the \nhousehold level, while interviews and focus group discussions will target specific groups such \nas females, the youth, community leaders, and government authorities. Opinions from various \ngroups will provide the necessary inputs to design project parameters and to ensure broad-\nbased participation and support for the project. Workshops and consultative meetings will be \nheld to sensitize communities and local government officials on project objectives, obtain their \nsupport, and disseminate the findings of the project preparatory TA. \n \n12.  A  participatory  approach  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  the  WSS  facilities  and \ncapacity-building programs for each project town will be demand-driven. The TA will undertake \nthe following activities: (i) review information and evaluate previous WSS projects by ADB, \nGovernment, and development partners; (ii) prepare and implement field surveys to assess the \nsocio-economic status of urban residents and the situation regarding WSS services; (iii) prepare \ngender, social and cultural assessment, and necessary action plans, along with measures to \nmitigate  adverse  impacts  on  minority  communities;  (iv)  assess  resettlement  impacts  and \nrequirements  and  prepare  resettlement  framework  and  plans;  (v)  prepare  environmental \nexaminations and plan containing necessary mitigation measures; (vi) prepare a financial and \neconomic  analysis;  (vii)  prepare  institutional  assessment  and  institutional  development \nprograms; (viii) conduct workshops to obtain critical inputs from stakeholders; (ix) identify and \ndelineate project components and subprojects; and (x) implement overall project management \nand progress reporting.  \n \n13.  An initial poverty and social assessment, which examines preliminary poverty conditions, \nminority issues, resettlement effects, gender issues, and vulnerable groups is in Appendix 2. All \nresettlement, environmental, and social assessments will be carried out according to ADB \nsafeguard procedures as indicated in the consultants\u2019 terms of reference in Appendix 3. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.2 million equivalent, comprising $694,000 in \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $506,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide \n$950,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $256,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby the Government of Japan. The Government contribution of $250,000 equivalent will cover \nthe provision of office accommodation and facilities, remuneration of counterpart staff, provision \nof workshop facilities, and domestic travel costs and per diem. Cost estimates and financing \narrangements are in Appendix 4. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the ensuing project.  \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  MOC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A project coordination unit, attached to \nthe Management Board for Urban Technical Infrastructure Development Projects will implement \nthe TA on behalf of MOC, as the coordinating agency at the central level. The PPC or DPC of \nthe  selected  project  area  will  be  the  implementing  agency,  which  will  set  up  a  project \npreparation unit comprising technical staff from relevant departments. The PWC will be the \ncounterpart for preparing  the  design  of  the  water  supply  component.  A project steering \ncommittee, to be chaired by a senior official of MOC, with members from the senior staff of the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Finance, State Bank of Viet Nam, participating \nPPCs/DPCs,  and  the  Management  Board  for  Urban  Technical  Infrastructure  Development \nProjects will be established prior to fielding the consultants. It will be convened to review and \nendorse the consultants\u2019 reports at each stage of the study, and/or at the request of any \nmember to discuss major policy and implementation issues.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months from 15 February 2005 to 15 October 2005. \nAn international consulting firm will be selected using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod in association with local consulting firms or individual domestic consultants. It will \nrequire  approximately  83  person-months  of  consulting  services  (23  person-months  of \ninternational and 60 person-months of domestic consultant input) with expertise in water supply \nand sanitation engineering, institutional development, environmental assessment, economic and \nfinancial  analysis,  social  development,  gender,  and  resettlement.  The consultants will be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of \nreference on the consulting services are given in Appendix 3. Equipment to be provided under \nthe TA will be purchased in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. All bidders, \nsuppliers, contractors, and consultants shall be required to observe the highest standards of \nethics in procuring and executing ADB-financed contracts and shall be subject to sanctions if \nfraud and corruption are discovered. \n \n17.  The consultants will submit to ADB the following reports: (i) an inception report within 3 \nweeks of mobilization, which contains a summary of the assignment and TA background, \nmethodology/approach, staffing and personnel, scheduling of activities, and project design \nparameters; (ii) an interim report within 4 months of mobilization, which includes survey and \nworkshop findings and a preliminary project design for all project towns; (iii) a draft final report \ncontaining a refinement of the  interim report, to be submitted within 6 months of consultant \nmobilization; (iv) a prefeasibility report, to be submitted to the Government of Viet Nam; (v) a \ndraft final report/feasibility study; and (vi) final report at the end of the TA. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n  \n18.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $950,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for preparing the Central Region Small \nand Medium Towns Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Indicators  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Monitoring Mechanisms \nTargets  Risks \nSector Goal       \n       \n\u2022 To reduce poverty and  \u2022 Access to safe, reliable,  \u2022 National indicators;

Gross domestic product \n(GDP) maintained an average annual growth of about 7% and the urban population ratio has increased from 20% in \n1990 to about 25% in 2003. The urban population in the Central Region totaled close to 4.5 million in 2003 and is \ngrowing at 4.7% per annum. Over the last decade, the urban infrastructure has been unable to meet the increasing \ndemands of the growing urban population due to insufficient funds and limited institutional capacity. This imbalance \nheightens environmental and health risks, and inhibits social and economic development of urban people in the \nCentral Region. \n \nThe proposed technical assistance (TA) will be used to prepare a water supply and sanitation project for Viet Nam\u2019s \nsmall and medium towns in the southern Central Region. The Project will contribute toward the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals and Targets. Improved water supply and sanitation has the potential of (i) increasing \ntime and cost-savings for women who collect, treat, and store water for daily consumption; (ii) improving community \nand family hygiene and health practices; (iii) reducing health care expenditures for households, especially for the poor \nand vulnerable; and (iv) improving individual well-being, which implies better health, increased productive days, and \nhigher school attendance. The proposed Project will cover services in 10\u201320 towns, including 10 towns in the five \nprovinces of Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, Ninh Thuan, Binh Thuan, and Dak Nong. With the exception of Dak Nong, eight \ntowns are accessible by National Road 1A and by a parallel rail line. A community health and hygiene program will \nhelp expand services to the poor and low-income areas. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                         Proposed Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe southern Central Region is one of the poorest in Viet Nam. The living standards are often lower with poverty \nlevels higher than the national average. Poor and near-poor households are the most vulnerable to inadequate urban \ninfrastructure and unsanitary conditions. The urban poor in the candidate project towns live in underserved areas with \neither inadequate water supply or nonexistent sanitation facilities, or both. For instance, the poor and low-income \nhouseholds are fishing households that reside along the coastal areas in Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, and Ninh Thuan. Poor \ntoilet and septic tank facilities add to unsanitary conditions and environmental pollution. The poor also suffer from \ndysfunctional or nonexistent drainage, frequent flooding, and limited access to solid waste collection. Improving water \nsupply and sanitation will reduce vulnerability associated with high health care expenditures due to environmental \nsickness.  \n \nA poverty analysis will be carried out to summarize the causes of poverty in the project towns, identify areas of high \npoverty incidence, prepare a complementary community-based water supply and sanitation program, assist in \nquantifying the benefits of the proposed Project in reducing poverty, and incorporate other social measures within the \nscope of project implementation. The poverty analysis will focus the poverty impact of the proposed interventions on \nthe poor and disadvantaged, including the contribution of the Project to reducing access barriers to water supply and \nsanitation services for the poor and the near-poor. Participatory methods will help address the needs of the poor, and \nstrengthen the pro-poor focus of the Project. The analysis will also include opportunities for generating new \nemployment and of enhancing community ownership and self-reliance. The analysis will be part of an overall poverty \nand social strategy for the Project. In the case of possibilities for employment, reference will be made for compliance \nto internationally recognized core labor standards as well as the country\u2019s labor legislation. \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nA stakeholder analysis will be required to identify key project stakeholders, their project-related interests, and the ways \nin which they affect project feasibility and success. Primary stakeholders include town residents, people and \ninstitutions affected by land acquisition and resettlement, ethnic minority people, vulnerable groups, rural populations \naround the town areas, and tourism and natural resource developers (e.g., salt and glass manufacturers). Secondary \nstakeholders include the Ministry of Construction, provincial and local people\u2019s committees, and relevant government \nagencies. The role of stakeholders will be disaggregated by age, gender, and ethnicity where possible. The role of \nmass organizations (e.g., women\u2019s union, youth union) and nongovernment organizations will also be considered. \n \nParticipation and consultation will be carried out with the above stakeholders during project preparation. Participatory \nrural appraisal techniques will be used in designing project components, implementation, operation and maintenance, \nand  monitoring  and  evaluation  arrangements.  The  process  will  involve  information  sharing,  consultations, \nsocioeconomic surveys, interviews, focus group meetings, workshops, participatory rural appraisal, and collaborative \ndecision making. Records of consultations will be noted and included in the poverty and social assessment and ", "1100  Appendix 2 \ndecision making. Records of consultations will be noted and included in the poverty and social assessment and \nstrategy. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nBased on stakeholder consultations, a participation strategy will be development. The strategy will delineate ways in \nwhich to enhance key stakeholders and beneficiaries participation, and will be key to the community-based health and \nhygiene  component,  poverty  and  social  strategy,  resettlement  plans,  and  initial  environmental  examinations. \nParticipation will also involve affected persons in developing resettlement plans. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nIn Viet Nam, females make up about 50% of the total population, and are generally responsible for a conducting a \nvariety of tasks related to water and sanitation. During project preparation, a detailed gender analysis will be \nconducted to determine how to better maximize project benefits for women. The purpose will be to address the needs \nand interests of women, especially female-headed households, and suggest measures on ways of maximizing their \nbenefits from the proposed Project. Particular attention will be given on ways to increase women\u2019s representation and \nenhance  their  decision-making  capabilities  through  awareness,  capacity  building,  and  employment.  Women\u2019s \nparticipation in mass organizations and provincial and district/town peoples committees will also be considered.   \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nA gender strategy will be developed during project preparation and integrated into an overall poverty and social \nstrategy.  Specific  gender  concerns  for  women  facing  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  addressed  in \nresettlement plans. \nE.
