The Government of Pakistan has requested policy-based lending totaling $600 million \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) concessional ordinary capital resources to support \ndemand and supply measures that will broaden and deepen the financial system, strengthen \nmarket stability, and enhance market facilitation.1 The program will help increase the capacity and \nsize of Pakistan\u2019s financial markets (program outcome) and support their role as a major catalyst \nfor transforming the economy into a more efficient, innovative, and competitive marketplace in the \nglobal arena (program impact). \n \n2.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will support diagnostic studies, policy dialogue, \nand the formulation of a long-term national capital market strategy, and assist the preparation of \nthe proposed Financial Markets Development Program. The program and the TA will be included \nin the country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022, for approval in the second quarter of 2019.  \n   \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Opportunity. A central objective of the government\u2019s economic development strategy, as \nreflected in Pakistan 2025: One Nation, One Vision,2 is to elevate Pakistan\u2019s status from a lower-\nmiddle-income  to  an  upper-middle-income  country  by  2025.  The  government  targeted  the \ngeneration of jobs and an increase in income levels as top priorities. Achieving these objectives \nwill require substantial investments of private and public capital to accelerate economic growth. \nRobust and well-functioning financial markets will help mobilize these resources, and can also \nmeet the financing needs for housing and infrastructure, two other top priorities of the government. \nIn collaboration with ADB, the government has implemented major financial market reforms since \nthe late 1990s, through three sector development programs. These were effective in gradually \nliberalizing the financial markets and brought significant progress. The government recognizes \nthe importance of continuing on this path and to build a strong and inclusive finance sector. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 prioritizes the development of the finance sector and capital markets \nto encourage the participation and growth of the private sector and enhance financial stability.3 \nPrivate sector investment is seen as a key driver of economic growth, and its facilitation is key in \nPakistan\u2019s endeavor to transform the economy into a competitive marketplace. It is also a \nstrategic area for ADB support in the country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 for Pakistan.4 \n \n5.  Development problem. The lack of sophistication in financial markets in Pakistan limits \nthe range of viable options for companies and borrowers seeking finance for growth. The \nsuppressive role of the government as the dominant borrower from banks further restricts the \nspace for private sector credit and essential long-term financing for infrastructure projects, which \nare in turn a prerequisite for economic growth. The economy remains overly reliant on bank \nfinancing (bank assets account for more than 70% of the country\u2019s total financial assets). \n \n                                                \n1  The loans will be disbursed as single-tranche policy-based loans of $300 million each for subprograms 1 and 2. The \nindicative implementation periods are May 2019 to July 2020 for subprogram 1 and August 2020 to July 2022 for \nsubprogram 2. \n2  Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission. 2014.

Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2015\u20132019. Manila. \n ", "2 \n6.  Pakistan\u2019s financial markets are underdeveloped and play an insignificant role in financial \nintermediation  and  resource  mobilization.  The  market  capitalization  of  the  Pakistan  Stock \nExchange accounted for only about 30% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. \nWith 558 listed companies and a $58 billion market capitalization, the exchange is substantially \nbelow regional peers on a per capita basis (in terms of listed companies) and as a percentage of \nGDP (in terms of market capitalization). Moreover, many listed companies have minimal \u201cfree \nfloat\u201d since most shares are held by sponsors, including the government. The accounting and \nauditing standards of listed companies are also unreliable and lack the facts for informed \ninvestment decisions. Beyond the unreliability of financial reporting is the issuer\u2019s concern over \npoor corporate governance. The corporate governance structure of listed companies is not \nsufficiently transparent and lacks proper checks and balances. Furthermore, financial stability is \ncompromised by inadequate policy coordination and the lack of coordinated supervision of the \nfinancial system. The absence of a high-level forum and, ultimately, of agreements that would \nenable Pakistan\u2019s financial market regulators to share information as well as coordinate sector \noversight and policy issues on a regular basis has led to opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. \nMoreover, the enforcement effectiveness of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan \nis challenged by the absence of a dedicated capital market tribunal, which also explains why the \nresolution of securities cases pending in the court system is so slow. \n \n7.  Bond market development is also constrained. The corporate bond market remains in its \nnascent  stage,  undermining  long-term  infrastructure  financing  requirements.  Its  share  in \nPakistan\u2019s GDP is just 2.2%, which is significantly less than that of its regional peers. Issuances \nin the primary market are dominated by government bonds, and corporate bond issuances are \nlimited and costly. The government bond market is primarily short-dated and does not fulfill its \nrole as a benchmark pricing reference\u2014ad hoc government debt management practices arising \nfrom the lack of a professional debt management office are a main reason for this. Also, the \nabsence of an effective government bond market yield curve impedes the appropriate pricing of \ncorporate  bonds,  which  makes  them  less  attractive  to  both  issuers  and  investors.  The \nnonexistence of concessions for listing fees, stamp duty, and other related costs exacerbates the \nproblem. On the demand side, major institutional investors (e.g., pension funds, insurance \ncompanies, and mutual funds) play a limited role in financing government and corporate bonds \nbecause of structural anomalies in the National Savings Schemes, which offer the same return \nas government bonds but, unlike government bonds, have insignificant downside risk prior to \nmaturity. The participation of investors across the maturity spectrum is critical for market growth. \n \n8.  ADB  intervention.  ADB  is  proposing  to  provide  up  to  $600  million  to  support  the \ndevelopment of financial markets by strengthening market stability, enhancing market facilitation, \nand broadening supply and demand measures. The proposed program is scheduled to be \nsubmitted for ADB Board consideration in the second quarter of 2020. It was requested by the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  as  a  policy-based  lending  modality  to  be  disbursed  over  two \nsubprograms. \n   \n9.  The transaction TA will support diagnostic studies, policy dialogue, and the preparation of \nthe proposed program. It will also help the government formulate a national capital market \ndevelopment master plan.5 The reforms under the program will serve to remove the binding \nconstraints to the achievement of a vibrant capital market, such as (i) ad hoc government debt \nmanagement practices and absence of a clear capital market development strategy for debt \nissuances; (ii) shallow and illiquid corporate bond and equity markets, and ineffective market \nfacilitation; and (iii) fragile market stability. The TA will also explore the measures required to \n                                                \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 July 2019.  \n ", "3 \nencourage broader participation of institutional investors in Pakistan\u2019s securities markets, and to \nlay the groundwork for introducing alternative financing instruments, such as derivatives, as the \nfinancial markets develop. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n10.  The objective of the TA is to (i) identify policy measures to support the development of a \nrobust financial market system in Pakistan that is well balanced, sustainable, resilient, and able \nto effectively intermediate savings to finance investments; and (ii) support the government in \nimplementing the reforms under the ensuing program. \n \n11.  Output  1:  Long-term  national  capital  market  development  strategy  and \nimplementation plan formulated and implemented. The TA team will formulate a long-term \nnational capital market development strategy and implementation plan that covers all essential \ndimensions such as equity market, bond market, derivative market, commodities market, money \nmarket, market surveillance and enforcement, and a qualification framework for professionals in \nthe securities industry. The strategy will help in defining a sustainable development schedule and \nin reaching agreement between the various stakeholders on new initiatives to tackle policy, legal, \nregulatory, supervisory, institutional, and capacity constraints. It will form the basis of policy \nactions to develop the government bond and corporate bond markets under the proposed \nprogram. International and regional experience in building resilient and liquid equity and bond \nmarkets will be considered while formulating the strategy. \n \n12.  The strategy will also map the scope and resources needed for a comprehensive training \nprogram for regulators as well as market participants, to be supported under a subsequent and \ndedicated TA project. \n \n13.  The consulting team will organize up to three strategic workshops with Pakistan\u2019s key \ncapital market stakeholders\u2014Ministry of Finance, Revenue and Economic Affairs; Securities and \nExchange Commission of Pakistan; State Bank of Pakistan, and market participants\u2014to present \nand consult on the findings and recommendations, and arrive at a consensus on the formulation \nof the final long-term national capital market development master plan and the policy actions to \nbe implemented under the ensuing ADB program. \n \n14.  Output 2: Legal, regulatory, and institutional framework streamlined. The TA team \nwill identify measures to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework that governs Pakistan\u2019s \ncapital markets by assessing and proposing amendments with a view to removing complexity in \nthe existing framework, broadening market access, enhancing market facilitation, as well as \nstrengthening  the  governance,  regulatory,  and  enforcement  powers  of  the  Securities  and \nExchange Commission of Pakistan. This output will also facilitate the promulgation of rules and \nregulations for the development of new financial markets (such as commodity and derivatives \nmarkets).  \n \n15.  Output 3: Development of debt and equity markets supported by broad demand and \nsupply measures. This component will focus on measures to trigger the extension of the \ngovernment yield curve and thereby advance corporate bond market development. The TA team \nwill analyze impediments to and recommend a strategy for a deep, liquid, and transparent debt \nmarket offering a wide range of products. It will also focus on developing the competitive pricing \nof primary corporate bond issuances, including promoting the role of credit rating agencies and \nsetup of a national credit risk database and rating system; assess the existing trading systems \nand procedures, and their integration; and recommend measures to improve the (cost-)efficiency \n ", "4 \nof market trading operations and of regulatory, surveillance, and enforcement functions. On the \ndemand side, the TA team will explore and assess measures to strengthen contractual savings \ninstitutions and pension funds as well as initiatives to increase institutional investors\u2019 demand for \ncorporate securities and their participation in capital markets. It will also define measures to \nenhance the depth and breadth of the equity market and its ability to serve the long-term financing \nneeds of the corporate sector (including state-owned enterprises, and small and medium-sized \nenterprises). Measures to facilitate corporate listings and boost the liquidity of the secondary \nmarket will also be explored. \n \n16.  The  government  also  requested  technical  support  for  the  development  of  nonbank \nfinancing companies, commodity markets, and areas relating to financial technologies, as well as \nsupport for building the capacity of the regulators and market players. These activities may be \nsupported subject to the arrangement of additional grant financing for technical assistance. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $500,000,  which  will  be  financed  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n18.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, inter-agency coordination, and other in-kind contributions. The government was \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will administer and implement the TA with the support of its Pakistan Resident \nMission. The Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division in ADB\u2019s Central and \nWest Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate the consultants.  \n \n20.
