The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  needed  to  undertake  sector \npreparatory  work  and  define  the  scope  of  the  ensuing  program.  These  outline  terms  of \nreference have been prepared using an output-based contract approach. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The project preparatory TA has been structured into three separate components: \n(i)  Component 1, supporting output 1, will focus on the preparation of a policy, \ngovernance, and institutional assessment, as well as detailed actions required to \nsupport  the  policy-based  loan.  These  will  include  all  of  the  program-level \nassessments required by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as per the latest \nADB guidelines and templates for policy-based loans.1  \n(ii)  Component 2, supporting output 4, will develop and deliver a sample capacity \ndevelopment  initiative  for  implementation  in  four  districts  under  batch  1 \nsubprojects, and a training program at the national and subnational levels, for \nimplementation under the program. This capacity building initiative would supply \nboth the policy-based loan and the investment loan.  \n(iii)  Component  3,  supporting  outputs  2  and  3,  will  (a)  conduct  a  background \nassessment of the rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector in the six \ntarget  provinces,  and  (b)  develop  feasibility  studies  (including  all  relevant \nassessments  per  the  latest  ADB  guidelines  and  templates)  for  batch  1 \nsubprojects as well as the overall procurement plan. Under component 3 (a), the \nconsultant will assess the potential for new approaches for how the investment \nloan will deliver water supply and sanitation interventions, including the possible \nuse  of  service  delivery  contracts  and/or  output-based  subsidies;  pro-poor \nmechanisms for better targeting; household-level financing solutions; and review, \ndesign and testing of a microfinance model for household sanitation. These will \ninform recommendations for updating the sector investment plan for RWSS, and \nalso the design of feasibility studies under component 3 (b).  \n \nC.  Cost Estimate and Financing Plan \n \n3.  The  project  preparatory  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,100,000  equivalent,  of  which \n$1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-V).2 The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff; \noffice space; surveys, engineering, and other studies previously conducted; and other in-kind \ncontributions.3 The government was advised that approval of the project preparatory TA does \nnot commit ADB to finance any ensuing  program. Indicative cost estimates, for budgeting \npurposes, are presented in Table A3.1. \n \n   \n                                                \n1  These will be provided and discussed upon commencement of the assignment.  \n2  Additional sources of financing, including disaster risk reduction financing under the 11th replenishment of the \nAsian Development Fund, are being explored.   \n3  Contributions are expected to amount to 9% of the total cost of the TA. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \nTable A3.1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n ($'000) \n Item  Total Cost \nA.

Consulting Services \n \n4.  A firm (or consortium of firms) with multisector experience will be engaged to undertake \nthe necessary studies for this project preparatory TA. The consulting firm(s) will be engaged \nfollowing the quality- and cost-based selection method, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10, using \nfull technical proposal procedures. Procurement of all consultancy services used under the \nproject preparatory TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).4  \n \n5.  All international consultants will have experience in working in similar assignments in \ndeveloping countries. Experience in the region, preferably in Cambodia, and experience in \nprocessing and implementing projects financed by international financing institutions, will be \nconsidered. All national consultants will have experience in similar assignments and working on \ninternational development projects. \n \n6.  The firm will deliver outputs organized as three components, as per paras. 7\u201311. \n                                                \n4 Output-based and/or lump sum contracts are being considered in the engagement of consulting services to reduce \nadministrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money. \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \n7.  Under component 1, the consultant will (i) conduct policy, governance, and institutional \nassessments; (ii) evaluate the results of the rural water supply operation and maintenance \n(O&M) and rural sanitation transfer pilot for the subnational administration; (iii) evaluate the level \nof  completion  of  actions  outlined  under  the  National  Rural  Water  Supply,  Sanitation  and \nHygiene Strategy, 2014\u20132025; the National Action Plan for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and \nHygiene, 2014\u20132018; and other documents; (v) draft sub-decrees, guidelines, and manuals in \nsupport of pending actions; (vi) prepare a policy matrix for  policy-based lending; and (vii) \nconduct all program level assessments required by ADB as per the latest ADB guidelines and \ntemplates  for  policy-based  loans.  Key  areas  of  expertise  for  this  component  will  include \ninstitutions and governance, policy, decentralization, and relevant technical areas (including \nRWSS). \n \n8.  Under component 2, the consultants will assess staff strength, skills, and responsibilities \nat the national, provincial, and district levels, and develop a carefully designed capacity building \ninitiative for district administration in response to functional assignment transfer for RWSS under \nthe batch 1 subprojects. In addition, the consultants will review existing manuals and guidelines \nand propose relevant updates in areas such as community management, O&M, user charges, \ncommunity  collection  and  administration,  groundwater  protection  and  conservation,  water \nconservation, behavior change communication, and environmental and hygiene education and \nawareness programs and campaigns. Key areas of expertise for this component will include \ninstitutions, governance and capacity development. \n \n9.  Under Component 3 (a), for the six Tonle Sap provinces, the consultant will conduct a \nbackground assessment that will encompass the following tasks: (i) assess the total financial \nenvelope available for the sector; (ii) describe, map, and quantify the condition of basic RWSS \namenities and services; (iii) assess managerial and administrative arrangements; (iv) conduct \nan inventory and critically review all relevant initiatives for infrastructure development, studies, \nplans, and programs, and public and private sector proposals in selected districts for sector \nimplementation; (v) describe existing relevant O&M procedures, tariffs, and status of billing and \ncollection for the selected subsectors; (vi) prepare a financing and budgeting strategy for safe \nRWSS,  focusing  on  poor  and  vulnerable  households,  and  reviewing  the  proportion  of \ncontribution  that  should  be  made  by  communities  in  each  province  and  district  (including \nthrough socio-economic and willingness to pay surveys to set criteria and setting of local rates); \n(vii) propose new approaches for how the investment loan will deliver RWSS interventions, \nincluding the possible use of service delivery contracts and/or output-based subsidies, pro-poor \nmechanisms for better targeting, household-level financing solutions, ad access to financing for \npoor households; and (viii) make recommendations for updating the sector investment plan for \nRWSS. \n \n10.  Under  component  3  (b),  the  consultant  will  develop  feasibility  studies  for  batch  1 \nsubprojects based largely on the approach taken under the Second Rural Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector Project but also incorporating new approaches as per the findings under the \noutputs of components 1, 2, and 3 (a). Development of the feasibility studies will encompass the \nfollowing: (i) prepare a preliminary engineering design for subprojects for four districts under \nbatch  1,  and  undertake  detailed  subproject  preparation  activities,  including  an  analysis  of \nsuitable technical options that incorporate climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction \nmeasures; (ii) estimate all program costs at market rates; (iii) present an overall procurement \nplan with procurement contract packages for all batches, clearly indicating the packages to be \nfinanced in line with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), and \nprepare master bidding documents for batch 1 subprojects; (iv) prepare detailed financing and \ndisbursement  plans;  (v)  conduct  assessments focusing  on  governance,  poverty  and  social \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \naspects, involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and environmental impacts (including \nrapid assessment of climate risks); (vi) conduct program economic and financial analyses, in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  for  economic  analysis  and  financial  management  and \nanalysis of projects, for the sector and  sample subprojects;5 (vii) review, design, and test \nmechanisms  for  access  to  finance  for  household  sanitation  to  ensure  viability  during \nimplementation, and thoroughly assess institutions for delivery during upscaling; (viii) through a \nsocioeconomic survey and other tools, assess the program\u2019s social impact, preparing poverty \nand social assessment and a gender action plan; (ix) confirm the safeguards categorizations, \npreparing  indigenous  peoples,  resettlement,  and  environmental  frameworks,  and  planning \ndocuments for batch 1 subprojects; and (x) develop standard contracts for O&M. \n \n11.   Key  areas  of  expertise  for  component  3  will  include  relevant  technical  expertise \n(including rural water supply, rural sanitation, water and engineering), economics, financial \nmanagement, microfinance, safeguards (environment and climate change, social development, \ngender and social safeguards) and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  project \npreparatory TA. The project preparatory TA consultants will be partly based in Phnom Penh (no \nmore than 50% of the time) and partly based in selected district administrations (at least 50% of \nthe time). The Ministry of Rural Development and district administrations will provide office \nspace  to  the  consultants.  The  government  will  provide  qualified  counterpart  staff,  office \nadministrative support services (where available) and logistics, and necessary data and reports. \nThe executing agencies and ADB will be responsible for supervision of the quality of the project \npreparatory  TA  work.  Disbursements  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  will  be  done  in \naccordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). The consultants may procure equipment through shopping in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The equipment procured will be transferred to the executing \nagency upon completion of the project preparatory TA. A project coordination unit within the \nDepartment of Rural Water Supply will be used for project management and coordination.  \n \n13.
