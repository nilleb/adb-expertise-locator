Areas \nidentified for support include: adoption and implementation of the new SOE law (ii) strengthening \nSOE governance (iii) developing and adopting a skills-based selection process for all SOE \ndirectors, (iv) establishing clear roles and accountabilities for SOE directors, (v) ensuring that \ncommercial  SOE  boards  operate  under  a  clear  commercial  mandate,  (vi)  developing  a \ncomprehensive community services obligation framework that would apply to all commercial \nSOEs, (vii) assisting SOEs develop an effective forward-looking business plan containing financial \nand non-financial performance targets; (viii) assist SOE bring audited accounts current, (ix) \ndeveloping a SOE ownership and reform policy that would guide future reform activities, and (x) \nestablishing a central SOE ownership monitoring entity (CMU) to enable effective ownership \nmonitoring including ensuring the SOE board is held accountable for performance. \n \nPakistan has over 206 SOEs which are incorporated under various legal structures. The majority \nof SOEs, 186, are established under the Companies Act 2017 of which 139 are deemed \ncommercial entities while 47 are registered as Section 42 companies. Section 42 companies are \ndeemed non-commercial enterprises. The remaining 20 SOEs comprise 11 statutory authorities \nand 9 development financial institutions (DFIs). SOEs operate in most economic sectors including \ntransport, ports, power, highways, manufacturing and heavy industries, postal and financial; they \nare often either the dominant or monopoly service provider in their respective sector. In financial \nyear 2016/17 the SOE portfolio generated a combined output of 10.9% of gross domestic product \n(GDP) and had an asset value that represented 53.7% of GDP.1 \n \nDespite the size and economic significance of the SOE portfolio, financial and operational \nperformance has been weak. For financial year (FY) 2018, the most recent data available, the \nportfolio comprised $119,091 million in total assets and $31,523 million in total equity but \ngenerated negative returns; (-1.37%) return on assets and (-5.16%) return on equity. Losses in \nthe four largest SOEs (Pakistan International Airlines, Pakistan Steel Mills, Pakistan Railways and \nPakistan Highway Authority) total over 3% of GDP (footnote 1). Government has been required \nto provide SOEs with ongoing financial support, which has compounded the adverse fiscal impact. \nLoans and subsidies paid to SOEs, and funded from the federal government budget, totaled $3.51 \nbillion in FY2017, representing 1.8% of GDP. In the 5-year period FY2013 to FY2017 the total of \nloans and subsidies paid to SOEs from the federal budget was $12.8 billion.2 \n \nThe following have been identified as the key drivers of poor SOE performance: \n(i)  The lack of a consistent and overarching law applying to all SOEs \n(ii)  The lack of an overarching SOE ownership and reform policy  \n(iii)  A confused and often conflicting operating mandate.   \n(iv)  Poor governance practices  \n \n1  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2020.
