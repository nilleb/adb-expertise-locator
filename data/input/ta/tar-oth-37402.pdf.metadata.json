In  1998  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  adopted  its  policy  on  gender  and \ndevelopment (GAD).1 The policy and related ADB-wide action plan2 promote gender equity as a \ncrosscutting strategy in all aspects of ADB\u2019s operations. In 1999 ADB adopted poverty reduction \nas its overarching objective.3 ADB\u2019s enhanced focus on poverty reduction underscores the \nimportance of mainstreaming gender, since gender equity is recognized as a key factor in \ntransforming growth into development and ni   reducing  poverty.  ADB's  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs) need assistance to narrow gender gaps and to meet the internationally \nendorsed  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  virtually  all  of  which  have  gender \ndimensions. \n  \n2.  The current challenge is to more closely align ADB\u2019s poverty reduction initiatives with \ngender equality goals and MDGs. Additional resources are required to support new approaches \nand  strategic  initiatives  linking  poverty  and  gender,  and  to  realign  initiatives  to  meet  the \nchallenges of the MDGs. In May 2003 ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved the establishment of \nthe Gender and Development Cooperation Fund. It is intended to support a coherent program of \nactivities to strengthen the capacity of ADB and DMC governments to (i) mainstream gender \nconsiderations into their policies, programs and projects; (ii) support innovative and strategic \napproaches to narrow gender gaps and empower women and girls; and (iii) promote regional \nawareness, partnerships, and cooperation on gender issues. This proposed regional technical \nassistance (TA) will launch the program.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB recently prepared an interim progress report on implementing the GAD policy,5  \nwhich was submitted to the Board of Directors in 2002. The report shows that, since approval of \nthe GAD policy, ADB has substantially increased its GAD activities since the pre-policy period. \nHowever, the report also reveals that this progress has been uneven and that much work \nremains to be done to consistently implement the GAD policy and action plan. \n \n4.  For example, gender strategies are being prepared in conjunction with country strategies \nand programs (CSPs), but considerable variation exists in the depth of analysis and integration \nof gender concerns in the main text of the CSP. Similar variations are found in the attention to \ngender in recent country poverty assessments and poverty reduction partnership agreements \nbetween ADB and individual DMCs. Gender specialists need to be included in teams preparing \nthe  CSPs  and  carrying  out  country  poverty  assessments  to  ensure  integration  of  gender \nconcerns and attention to gender-related MDGs. \n  \n5.  Preparation of loans that directly promote gender equality and the empowerment of \nwomen and girls, as well as loans that mainstream gender concerns, should be improved. More \nloans that have GAD as a thematic objective and mainstream gender issues are required. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998.

Manila. ", "  2\n    \nProject-specific gender plans also need to be prepared for more loans to ensure gender-\ninclusive design and implementation. \n \n6.  The GAD action plan also includes a limited number of grant-based initiatives for GAD \ncapacity-building in national women\u2019s ministries and executing agencies (EAs) in selected \nDMCs, as well as regional TA grants in areas such as gender and governance, and combating \ntrafficking of women and girls. Although a small proportion of ADB\u2019s overall TA, these activities \nneed to be continued and expanded, particularly in capacity building for GAD within DMCs.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The proposed TA will help ADB more consistently and effectively implement its GAD \npolicy  and  action  plan.  The  TA  will  also  help  key  government  agencies  in  DMCs  more \nsystematically  address  gender  concerns  in  planning,  development,  and  implementation  of \nprograms and projects to reduce gender disparities and meet the MDGs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The proposed TA includes the following fund approved categories of activities under the \nprogram. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n9.  CSP Activities. ADB\u2019s GAD policy recognizes that gender mainstreaming has to begin \nwith development of CSPs, which provide the medium-term frameworks for ADB\u2019s assistance to \nits DMCs. Unless gender issues are adequately addressed at this \u201cupstream\u201d stage, it is unlikely \nthat the ensuing pipeline of assistance will promote gender equality and the empowerment of  \nwomen. The systematic integration of gender concerns in CSPs requires the preparation of \ngender strategies to define how ADB\u2019s program of assistance to the DMC will address gender \ndisparities and promote gender equity. This component will selectively finance preparation of \ngender strategies and other selective upstream work to integrate gender in national poverty \nreduction strategies and CSPs, and to realign ADB\u2019s loan and TA portfolios with the MDGs. \nPossible activities in this area include (i) gender assessments of selected government policies \nand  programs;  (ii)  gender  inputs  to  sector  strategies  and  roadmaps;  and  (iii)  support  for \ndevelopment  of  more  gender-sensitive  macroeconomic  frameworks,  planning  and  budget \nprocesses, and poverty monitoring systems.  \n \n10.  Gender Plans and Other Support for ADB Loans. The GAD policy and action plan \ninclude commitments to increase the number of ADB loans that (i) promote gender equity and \nempower  women  and  girls,  and  (ii)  more  effectively  mainstream  gender  concerns.  Some \nprogress in these areas was noted in the progress report, including development of gender \nplans for individual loan projects. However, additional resources are needed to replicate good \npractices in more loan projects. Therefore, this component will finance (i) the development of \ngender plans for a larger number of loan projects, for more DMCs, and in a wider range of \nsectors; and (ii) other strategic GAD support for loan projects.  \n \n11.  Recent ADB experience has shown the benefits of project-specific gender plans that \ninclude targets, gender-inclusive design elements, specific budget allocations, and gender-\nspecific indicators for monitoring to ensure effective gender mainstreaming. Funds will be \nprovided under this component to include gender experts in loan preparation teams to help ", "3 \nconduct  gender  analysis  and  prepare  project-specific  gender  plans.  These  plans  will  be \nincorporated in project documents and covenanted to ensure their implementation. Projects with \nhigh potential for gender-inclusive design and for replication of good practices developed in \nprevious projects will be emphasized. Efforts will be made to ensure that support is given to \nprojects in a variety of sectors and subsectors, including infrastructure, small and medium-sized \nenterprise development, and governance and legal reform. \n \n12.  Country and local conditions need to be taken into account in identifying gender issues \nand gender gaps, and in developing effective strategies to promote gender equity in particular \nprojects. In many instances, loan projects may require a social preparation phase or special \nfeatures to facilitate women\u2019s participation and equitable access to loan inputs. For instance, \nwomen members of water users\u2019 associations may need training to understand the association \nbylaws or to participate effectively in the association, or women may need to be mobilized to \naccess extension services and other inputs from an agriculture or rural development project. \nHence, this component will finance strategic interventions in conjunction with loan projects to \nprepare  women  or  to  help  them  fully  participate  in  loan  project  activities.  Interventions \nassociated with loan projects to address issues such as prevention of trafficking in women and \nchildren, violence against women, and the impact of industrial restructuring on women workers \nwill be supported. In many instances, these initiatives will be more effectively conducted by \nwomen\u2019s nongovernment organizations (NGOs) with experience in these areas but need to be \nlinked to larger government loan projects for greater impact.  \n \n13.  GAD Capacity Building. Limited technical capacity for gender analysis and planning, \nwithin ADB and in DMCs, seriously hinders the development and implementation of gender-\nresponsive loan projects and programs, and any increase in ADB activities focusing on gender \nequality and empowering women and girls. To make progress in these areas, and to fulfill the \ncommitments made in ADB\u2019s GAD action plan, this subcomponent will support capacity building \nof (i) national women\u2019s ministries and other focal agencies in DMCs, and (ii) EAs in ADB-\nsupported sectors of DMCs.  \n \n14.  For several years, ADB has been providing TA to national women\u2019s ministries and other \nfocal agencies to help develop and implement GAD policy and undertake gender capacity \nbuilding.  Most  recently,  this  support  has  been  provided  in  Fiji,  Indonesia,  Lao  People's \nDemocratic Republic, Pakistan and Viet Nam.  These strategic GAD activities are crucial to \npromote and institutionalize gender mainstreaming in DMCs. This subcomponent will provide \nfunds to continue and expand these activities, including selective support to ministries of women \nfor more strategic planning; promotion of gender audits and gender-responsive budgeting; and \nintegration  of  gender  concerns  in  national  poverty  reduction  strategies,  and  governance \nprograms, especially in the context of decentralization.6  \n \n15.  EAs  have  limited  gender  technical  capacity,  which  hinders  effective  gender \nmainstreaming, even in projects designed to address gender-related objectives. This applies \nespecially to EAs that are largely infrastructure or engineering oriented, with limited social \nscience  skills.  This  subcomponent  will  help  EAs  implement  ADB-financed loans that are \ndesigned to be gender-inclusive. Activities under this subcomponent may include (i) gender \ntraining  activities  for  executing  and  implementing  agency  staff;  (ii)  preparation  of  gender \nchecklists, good practices, and other materials tailored to the specific country and sector; (iii) \nlateral learning opportunities such as field visits across sectors or within a sector to learn from \n                                                 \n6  More comprehensive capacity-building programs for particular ministries will be supported through stand-alone TA \nprojects processed separately under the program.  ", "  4\n    \nother projects; (iv) support to allow project directors from one country to participate as resource \npersons for training in another; (v) gender training for DMC officials, especially from ministries of \nfinance or planning; and (vi) preparation of modules for gender training of EA staff who attend \nADB\u2019s annual project implementation seminars. In light of the limited technical and human \nresource capacity of many EAs, the TA will also provide opportunities to improve links between \nEAs and other actors in the same sector, including community-based women\u2019s groups, NGOs, \nprivate service providers, and local research institutes.  \n \n16.  Gender Impact Assessments. In a variety of sectors, ADB has financed loan projects \nthat either have carried a GAD thematic classification or have been designed with effective \ngender  mainstreaming.  Most  of  these  projects  are  under  implementation.  Gender  impact \nassessments will be conducted to estimate the impacts of these loans, the effectiveness of \ngender plans or measures included in the loan designs, implementation constraints, potential for \nimproving  design  or  implementation  arrangements,  and  replicability.  These  gender  impact \nassessments will be used to identify midcourse corrections and to prepare materials on good \npractices and lessons learned. This component may finance selective assessments of individual \nloans or loan clusters within a particular sector or DMC.  \n \n17.  GAD Partnerships. This component will support activities related to new and emerging \ngender issues in the Asia and Pacific region, as well as ADB\u2019s partnerships with women\u2019s \norganizations, other development partners, and regional networks to promote gender equality \nand empower women. For example, the TA may support joint activities with institutions such as \nthe Commonwealth Secretariat, International Labour Organization, International Organization \nfor Migration, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Development Fund for \nWomen, and World Bank, and bilateral development agencies of ADB\u2019s member countries, to \nsupport the mainstreaming of gender considerations in national poverty strategies, development \nplans and budget processes, and to address violence against women and gender issues related \nto  HIV/AIDS7  prevention  and  treatment,  conditions  of  migrant  workers,  human  trafficking, \npostconflict reconstruction, and other concerns.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA, estimated at $1.5 million, will be financed by the Gender and \nDevelopment Cooperation Fund on a grant basis. Indicative cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will implement the TA. The Poverty Reduction and Social Development Division \n(RSPR) of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), in association with \nthe regional departments, will be responsible for all TA activities. Subproject concepts may be \ndeveloped by staff in the regional departments, resident missions (RMs) and RSDD, and at the \nsuggestion  of  fund  contributors  and  focal  ministries  and  agencies  in  DMCs.  Proposed \nsubproject activities will be described in short concept papers, which will be screened initially by \nRSPR and then submitted to an internal peer review committee for endorsement and approval. \nThe committee will consist of ADB staff with gender expertise from the regional departments \nand RSPR. A simplified format for subproject proposals will be provided by RSPR to all regional \ndepartments and RMs following approval of the TA.8  \n                                                 \n7  HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \n8  Endorsement by the peer review committee will constitute approval of all subproject proposals.  ", "5 \n \n20.  The  department  or  RM  that  submitted  proposals  for  approval  will  implement  the \nsubproject in consultation with RSPR and other concerned staff. Subprojects generated by \ndepartments at ADB headquarters will be implemented in close cooperation with the relevant \nRMs. In all subprojects, strong emphasis will be placed on using local expertise and involving \ncivil society, in particular community-based women\u2019s organizations and NGOs, to strengthen the \ncapacity of local resource  persons and local institutions. Regional and subregional activities \nmay be supported under the TA. Care will be taken to ensure subregional, country, and sector \nbalance.  \n \n21.  A  TA  office  will  be  established  in  RSPR.  Approximately  24  person-months  of \ninternational consultants with gender expertise will be needed to coordinate and monitor TA \nactivities. One full-time administrator and research assistant, financed by the TA, will support \nthe TA team and peer review committee in overall coordination and implementation of the TA. \nAdditional short-term international and domestic consultants with gender and other relevant \nexpertise will be engaged to implement particular TA activities. Consultants will be recruited as \nindividuals. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  recruitment  of  domestic \nconsultants will be used to select and engage TA consultants. Any procurement of goods and \nother services for TA activities will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 38 months, from December 2003 to February 2007. \nRSPR will prepare a consolidated annual report on the TA and the overall program. Selected \nreports will be posted on the GAD page of ADB\u2019s website.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n23.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGender and Development Cooperation Fund for Promoting Gender Equality and Women\u2019s \nEmpowerment.

These outline terms of reference for consultants describe the main tasks for international \nand domestic consultants in the categories of activities included in the technical assistance (TA) \nto  help  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  developing  member  country  (DMC) \ngovernments systematically address gender concerns in their programs and projects. The \ncategories of activities for which consulting services are expected to be required are (i) gender \nand development (GAD) support for country strategy and program (CSP) activities; (ii) gender \nplans and other support for ADB loan projects and programs; (iii) GAD capacity building of \nnational women\u2019s ministries and executing agencies in ADB-supported sectors; (iv) gender \nimpact assessments of selected loan projects and programs; and (v) TA coordination, and \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E). Most of the TA consultants will be recruited as individuals. \nMore detailed terms of reference will be  prepared for each consultant or consulting team \nengaged under the TA. \n \nA.  GAD Support for CSP Activities \n \n2.  International and/or domestic gender specialists will be selectively engaged to (i) carry \nout gender analysis, including review of gender-related statistics, participatory assessments and \nconsultations  with  government  officials,  women\u2019s  organizations  and  community  groups,  in \nconnection with country poverty assessments and preparation of CSPs; (ii) propose gender \nstrategies, and provide gender inputs to sector strategies and roadmaps, for CSPs; and (iii) \ncarry out in-depth studies on emerging gender issues relevant to ADB\u2019s operations in particular \nDMCs, such as women\u2019s migration, gender-differentiated impacts of economic policy reforms, \nand gender issues within ethnic minority groups.    \n \nB.  GAD Support for ADB Loan Projects and Programs \n \n3.  International and/or domestic gender specialists will be selectively engaged to (i) help \nloan project and program design teams conduct gender analysis and prepare project-specific \ngender plans or strategies; (ii) develop and implement strategic interventions in ADB-financed \nloan projects to facilitate women\u2019s participation in project activities (e.g., through training and \nmobilization support); (iii) develop subcomponents of loan projects or grant-based activities \nlinked to loan projects to address gender-related issues (e.g., prevention of trafficking in women \nand  children,  violence  against  women,  and  impact  of  industrial  restructuring  on  women \nworkers);  and  (iv)  develop  stand-alone  projects  that  demonstrate  innovation  in  promoting \ngender equality and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 empowerment (e.g., in connection with post-conflict \nreconstruction in DMCs such as Afghanistan and Sri Lanka).  \n \n4.  Women\u2019s nongovernment organizations may also be engaged under the TA to carry out \nsocial preparation and supplementary activities developed for ADB-financed loan projects as \ndescribed in para. 3. \n \nC.  GAD Capacity Building \n \n5.  International and/or domestic gender specialists will be selectively engaged to (i) provide \ntraining and capacity building to national women\u2019s ministries in DMCs (e.g., to promote gender \naudits, gender-sensitive planning, and gender-responsive budgeting); and (ii) provide gender \ntraining and capacity building to executing and implementing agency staff in ADB-supported \nsectors (e.g., by preparing gender checklists and guidelines relevant to the country and sector, ", "9  \nAppendix 3 \nfacilitating exchange visits and other lateral learning experiences, and preparing gender training \nmodules for project implementation seminars for project directors and executing agency staff).  \n \nD.  Gender Impact Assessments \n \n6.  International and/or domestic gender specialists will be engaged to carry out selective \ngender assessments of individual loans or loan clusters financed by ADB within a particular \nDMC or sector.
