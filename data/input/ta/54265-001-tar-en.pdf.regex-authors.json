The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will assist Kazakhstan in fighting \nthe negative impact on the local labor market of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) \npandemic by minimizing the effect on the most vulnerable parts of the population and preparing \nfor post-crisis socioeconomic development based on newly emerging industries, professions, and \njobs. The Solidarity Fund for Kazakhstan (SFK), created by government agencies with technical \nand financial assistance from development partners, will provide the training and retraining to \nbuild capacity and skills in emerging sectors such as agriculture, e-commerce, and information \ntechnology.  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the support measures and new economic development strategy \nintroduced by the Government of Kazakhstan in response to the challenges caused by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The TA\u2019s objective is to assist the government in providing timely labor \nmarket support measures to address crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.1 The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Kazakhstan, 2021\u20132023.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Kazakhstan is facing tremendous challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and \nthe reduction in oil prices since early 2020, which have jointly resulted in an unprecedented \neconomic and social crisis. The government has adopted programs that seek to diversify the \neconomy, but Kazakhstan remains heavily dependent on extractive industries, with over 70% of \nexport revenues derived from basic commodities, especially oil and gas. This production structure, \nwhich is typical of countries affected by so-called \u201cDutch disease\u201d,3 creates pronounced economic \nvulnerabilities that amplify the impact of the ongoing crisis. \n \n4.  The economic crisis in Kazakhstan is impacting business activities, especially those of \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with the services sector contracting by 5.6% in the \nfirst half of 2020. The full impact on employment has yet to be assessed, but COVID-19-induced \nmeasures caused 4.2 million people to be suspended or laid off during the quarantine.4 A survey \nconducted by Atameken5 (an entrepreneur\u2019s association in Kazakhstan) in August 2020 suggests \nthat local firms will likely dismiss more than 35% of their employees because of the COVID-19 \npandemic assessments of the impact of the crisis on local employment vary, but government \nagency announcements suggest that out of 8.5 million employed people, over 2 million are \nexpected to temporarily or permanently lose their jobs. Over 3.7 million people are expected to \nhave reduced or no income during the pandemic and will receive social payments from the \ngovernment. A survey indicates 26% of female respondents lost their jobs or faced a reduction in \npaid working hours, while 81% of women reported their time spent on domestic work increased.6 \nTraditionally, women are predominantly employed in tourism, hospitality, and service sector jobs.7 \n \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 May 2020. \n2  ADB. 2020.

Gender.  \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Social discontent and fragmentation are expected to increase as the proportion of the work \nforce being laid off increases and the most vulnerable people experience the negative economic \nimpact of the prolonged containment measures (e.g., social distancing and quarantines). These \nmeasures have also served to substantially transform the labor market. Several professions are \nstruggling  as  a  result  of  reduced  demand  for  traditional  skills  and  the  ongoing  significant \ntransformation in and the increased use of remote working arrangements, leading to a surge in \nunemployment. Impacts on services and manufacturing production have resulted in massive \nlayoffs. The tourism industry has been heavily affected as countries closed borders and blocked \nthe movement of people to contain the spread of COVID-19. Increasing displacement in the labor \nmarket and the low capacity of the labor force to adapt to new job opportunities will likely lead to \ndeep social and economic impacts that push more people into poverty.    \n \n6.  Through  training  programs  and  a  subsequent  increase  in  labor  force  capacity  in \nKazakhstan, the TA will help the government achieve the targets set out in President Tokayev\u2019s \nstate of the nation address on 1 September 2020, specifically increasing the contribution of SMEs \nto gross domestic product to 35% by 2025, and increasing the number of people employed to 4 \nmillion.8 \n \n7.  The  proposal  from  the  Ministry  of  National  Economy  to  establish  SFK  was  further \nelaborated through a series of informal meetings among prospective partners, with subsequent \nsupport  provided  to  Kazakhstan  in  March\u2013October  2020  by  ADB,  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the World Bank, and other development partners. The SFK \nwill focus on delivering training and re-training programs to help poor and vulnerable people who \nlost their jobs due to the pandemic find new jobs in the post-COVID-19 economy. Initially, the SFK \nwas intended to also assist with the provision of material relief (food and medicine) and the \ncreation of an online platform for the provision of public services to SMEs. These activities were, \nhowever, supported by ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund and other government \nprograms that were not anticipated during the concept stage of the TA. The Asia Pacific Disaster \nResponse Fund approved a $3.0 million emergency grant9 to the government to provide medical \nsupplies and life-saving equipment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government \nupdated its request for the SFK to focus on retraining and skills upgrading to develop capabilities \nand expertise in industries and sectors that are expected to provide most business development \nopportunities in the post-COVID-19 environment. Joint financing and management of TA activities \nby ADB, UNDP, and the World Bank in collaboration with the government are expected to produce \nrelevant synergies and complementarities.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: supporting measures and new economic \nstrategy introduced by the government to respond to COVID-19 challenges. The TA\u2019s outcome is \ntimely labor market support measures provided by the government to address crises caused by \nthe COVID-19 pandemic.10 \n \nB.

To properly \ndesign and deliver new labor-related training programs, the SFK will support conducting an \nanalysis of the professions needed in the post-COVID-19 environment as part of the ongoing \ninitiative  of  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Protection  of  Population  (MLSPP)  and  BTS \nEducation.11 Building skills in the COVID-19 context will be integrated into a labor market \nmodernization roadmap developed by the MLSPP under the framework of the World Bank\u2019s Skills \nand  Jobs  Project,12 including  online  skills  enhancement  training  for  people  who  are  (i) \nunemployed and unproductively self-employed, and (ii) currently employed but in need of training. \nConcurrently, the SFK will assist with developing individual employment schemes supported by \nmentoring, counseling, and orientation. This output will be delivered from December 2020 until \nApril 2021. \n \n10.  Output 2: Training programs for skills development delivered. The SFK will develop \nand deliver a complete set of training and retraining programs for skills development to help poor \nand vulnerable people who lost their jobs due to COVID-19 find new job opportunities in the post-\npandemic environment, including women in rural areas. Such training can be extended to \nreskilling and upskilling of those workers who are at risk of losing their jobs as a result of problems \nadapting to emerging needs for skills and new business processes. To accomplish this, the SFK \nwill help quantify total job losses in the country and assess the impact of COVID-19 on individual \nand family incomes. International and local experts will help identify emerging industries and \nsectors in the post-COVID-19 pandemic environment and design focused training programs for \nthe local workforce to serve both national and international markets. Many firms will realize the \nneed to realign their business processes, products and services to new standards of production, \ntrading, packaging and delivery, and the successful restarting of business operations post-\nCOVID-19 will require new skills and adaptation of vocational training. The output will be delivered \nin close collaboration with MLSPP and coordinated with the World Bank\u2019s ongoing Skills and Jobs \nProject (footnote 12). This output will be delivered from January 2021 until December 2022. \n \n11.  Output 3: Training programs for  small and medium-sized enterprises to enter \nemerging  industries  delivered.  The  SFK  will  develop  and  deliver  training  programs  in \ncollaboration with the Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund to assist SMEs enter emerging \nindustries that are expected to emerge in the post-COVID-19 economy, such as agriculture, e-\ncommerce, and information technology. The programs will also support women entrepreneurs \nand capacity building. Online programs will be targeted to improve existing skills and provide \neducation on new competencies required to promote entrepreneurship activity. Courses will be \ndelivered in accordance with business needs and provided in the Kazakh and Russian languages. \nThis output will be delivered from January 2021 until December 2022. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The indicative key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.
