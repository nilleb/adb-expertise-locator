THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Bridge Replacement for Improved Rural Access Sector \nProject. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Major Bridges Study, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve PNG\u2019s two-lane national road network by replacing narrow \ntemporary modular steel (or Bailey) and other deteriorated bridges with permanent two-lane \nstructures. The reusable Bailey bridges will be reassembled on rural roads to improve access. \nThe project is the first phase of the proposed bridge replacement program and covers five of the \n16 priority national roads. It is envisaged that the project scope will be expanded in future to \nfinance subsequent phases of the bridge replacement program. The project will develop the \ncapacity of the Department of Works (DOW) bridge asset management system (BAMS) and \nimprove road safety awareness in rural areas of PNG where the accident rate is high. The \nproject preparatory work was undertaken through Asian Development Bank (ADB) financed \nTA.2     \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The 6.6 million population of PNG spread over a land area of about 462,000 square \nkilometers (km2) is connected by a network of 8,500 km of national roads and over 20,000 km of \nprovincial and district roads. The bulk of the population (87%) lives in rural areas. The road \nnetwork on the mainland is not fully integrated because of rugged mountains, major rivers, and \nrainforests\u2014requiring air and marine transport to access unconnected areas. Similarly, the \nislands are connected by air and shipping lines. However, most of the population depends on \nroad transport for its economic activities and basic social services.   \n \n4.  Owing  to  the  rugged  terrain  and  geographic  and  climatic  conditions,  PNG  has  a \nrelatively large number of bridges for the size of its road network. It is estimated that there are \nover 700 bridges on the national road network.3 A large proportion of these are single-lane \nBailey bridges4 that were used because of their low cost and faster deployment during early \nstages of development of the national road network. However, limited load carrying capacity, \nincreasing traffic volume, and deterioration over time have made the Bailey bridges a safety risk \nand weak link in the two-lane national road system. Although the government, with the support \nof development partners, is actively improving and upgrading the roads, there has not been \nmuch investment for improvement of bridges. In view of the large number of bridges involved, a \nlong-term program is needed to replace the Bailey and other deteriorated bridges gradually\u2014\nstarting with the 16 priority national roads.5  \n \n5.  The project offers a comprehensive bridge replacement program. A sector approach is \nadopted to strengthen the support for the government\u2019s policies for development of the road \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Preparing the Bridge Replacement for Improved Rural \nAccess Project. Manila (TA 7594-PNG).  \n3 From DOW\u2019s BAMS database. The estimate does not include culverts and other minor structures. \n4 Bailey bridges were originally developed for providing temporary crossing in case of emergencies such as natural \ndisasters and military use.   \n5 See the National Transport Development Plan, 2006\u20132010. The 16 roads provide the main arterial system of the \ncountry.    ", "2   \nsubsector and to provide flexibility in implementation. Detailed selection criteria have been \ndeveloped to assign priority to bridges that are to be replaced. Based on available financing and \nease of contract packaging, bridges will be selected from the prioritized list. The project is the \nfirst phase of implementation of the program and includes five priority national roads identified \nby the DOW.6 It is envisaged that the scope of the project will be scaled up in future to include \nall  16 priority  roads  and  other  key  roads  by  financing  subsequent  phases  through  ADB\u2019s \nAdditional Financing Policy.7   \n \n6.  The  Bailey  bridges  that  are  removed  from  the  national  roads  and  are  in  useable \ncondition will be reassembled on selected rural roads that lack bridges for crossing streams and \nrivers. This will improve accessibility of the rural population to markets, livelihood opportunities, \neducation, and health facilities. The improved connectivity of rural roads with the national roads \nwill enhance the effectiveness of the overall road network, bringing higher economic returns \nfrom increased traffic.  \n \n7.  Road  safety  is  a  major  issue  in  PNG.  The  fatality  rate  of  45  road  deaths  per \n10,000 vehicles in PNG is one of the highest in the Western Pacific region. About 37% of the \ndeaths are pedestrians. Rural areas have a much higher number of crashes, fatalities, and \nserious injuries. The National Road Safety Council (NRSC) was established in 2007 to advise \nand coordinate road safety activities. Despite limited resources, the NRSC has been actively \npursuing road safety initiatives, particularly awareness campaigns, in and around the capital city \nof Port Moresby, which has the largest urban population. Similar initiatives are needed in rural \nareas, where 87% of the population resides and the accident rate is high.8 \n \n8.  The DOW\u2019s road asset management system was established in 2003 and BAMS was \nestablished in 2005, for systematic management of the road network. The DOW relies on \nprovincial staff to collect and update the database regularly. However, because of shortage of \nstaff and financial resources, data collection has been irregular and fragmented. Over time, the \ndatabase has become outdated and is of little use for planning and operations. To make \neffective use of BAMS, there is a need to improve the database.               \n \n9.  PNG\u2019s Strategic Vision 2050; the Development Strategic Plan (DSP), 2010\u20132030; and \nthe  Medium  Term  Development  Plan  (MTDP),  2011\u20132015  emphasize  lack  of  transport \ninfrastructure as a constraint for PNG\u2019s economic and social development. The trade and \neconomic  development  targets  in  the  DSP  and  MTDP  require  considerable  growth  in  the \ncoverage and quality of the national road network. The 10 economic corridors for integrated \ndevelopment in the DSP coincide with the 16 priority national roads. Improvements on these \nroads will have a direct impact on economic development. Effective service delivery and income \nopportunities for the rural population are key priorities. Improved accessibility of rural road \nnetworks will open up markets, increase agricultural profitability, facilitate market chain linkage \nwith downstream processing and export markets, and increase access to education and health \nfacilities.    \n \n10.  The  bridge  replacement  program  is  included  in  the  current  National  Transport \nDevelopment Plan, 2006\u201320109 but could not be implemented because of resource constraints. \n                                                \n6 DOW has selected five priority corridors: Magi highway, Hiritano highway, Ramu highway, Sepik highway, and New \nBritain highway. \n7 ADB. 2010. Additional Financing: Enhancing Development Effectiveness. Manila.  \n8 NRSC. 2011. 2007 Road Safety Data Report. Port Moresby.  \n9 The National Transport Development Plan will remain effective until the government approves the new NTS. ", "   3 \nA long-term National Transport Strategy (NTS), 2011\u2013203010 is under preparation to support the \nDSP  and  will  become  effective  on  completion.  The  NTS  supports  the  bridge  replacement \nprogram by emphasizing the desirable and/or minimum level of service for the national roads, \nwhere narrow Bailey bridges are considered below standard and a safety and security risk. The \ngovernment is keen to proceed with the replacement of temporary Bailey and other deteriorated \nbridges on the national roads with permanent structures. This is reflected in ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132015,11 and the country operations business plan, 2011\u20132012.12   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  impact  will  be  improved  access  to  markets  and  social  services  for  the  rural \npopulation  in  selected  provinces  of  PNG.  The  outcome  will  be  a  better  connected,  more \nefficient, and safer road network in rural areas of selected provinces.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The project will have four key outputs:  \n \n(i)   Bridge  replacement.  The  project  will  replace  20\u201330  Bailey  bridges  on  five \npriority national roads (footnote 6) with permanent two-lane bridges. The bridges \nare  prioritized  for  each  road  following  detailed  selection  criteria  based  on \n(a) traffic,  (b)  condition,  (c)  residual  life,  (d)  availability  of  alternative  routes, \n(e) safety of road users, (f) population served, and (g) additional works involving \nmajor realignment and river training. The bridges will be selected considering \npriority ranking, availability of funds, safeguards and economic due diligence \nrequirements, and contract packaging.      \n(ii)   Improving rural access. For the Bailey bridges that have been removed from \nthe five priority national roads and are in usable condition, the project will finance \ntheir reassembly on rural roads that lack bridges. The provincial governments will \nidentify priority rural roads, following selection guidelines, preferably in the vicinity \nof  the  location  from  where  the  bridges  were  removed.  The  dismantling, \ntransportation, and reassembly of Bailey bridges will be part of the main civil \nworks contract for construction of permanent bridges.       \n(iii)   Capacity  development  of  the  Department  of  Work\u2019s  bridge  asset \nmanagement system. The project will support BAMS to engage and train staff, \nundertake inventory and condition surveys on the 16 priority national roads, and \nupdate  the  database  on  bridges.  The  work  will  be  carried  out  in  close \ncoordination with the provincial units of the DOW.  \n(iv)   Road safety awareness in rural areas. The project will finance road safety \ncampaigns in rural areas along the five priority national roads. The activities will \ninclude training for schoolchildren and communities in rural areas, complemented \nby media campaigns. The DOW will engage the NRSC under a contract to carry \nout road safety awareness in rural areas.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n13.  The project is estimated to cost $100.0 million.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The DOW will be the executing agency and implementing agency for the project. The \nexisting project implementation  unit (PIU) within the DOW that is responsible for all ADB-\nfinanced projects will implement this project. The PIU, headed by the project director for ADB \nloans, will be strengthened with additional staff to manage day-to-day implementation activities. \nThe PIU will be responsible for engaging all consulting services and civil works contracts. A \nproject  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  oversee  implementation,  monitor  progress,  provide \nguidance to the executing agency, and approve bridges to be replaced on selected priority \nnational  roads  as  well  as  sites  on  rural  roads  where  reusable  Bailey  bridges  will  be \nreassembled. The PSC will meet at least quarterly and will be chaired by the secretary, DOW. \nThe members of the PSC will comprise representatives from the National Roads Authority, the \nDepartment of Transport, the NRSC, the Department of National Planning and Monitoring, and \nthe  Department  of  Treasury.  Representatives  of  the  Department  of  Environment  and \nConservation, the Department of Lands and Physical Planning, and provincial governments may \nbe invited to PSC meetings to discuss specific issues.   \n \n17.  The project will finance additional staff, equipment, and office furnishings to supplement \nthe existing PIU resources for implementing the project. The additional staffing will consist of a \nproject  engineer,  an  accountant,  and  a  community  development  officer  to  oversee \nimplementation  of  the  gender  action  and  resettlement  plans.  ADB  financing  for  PIU \nstrengthening is an integral part of ADB\u2019s support for capacity development. The government \nhas  given  assurance  that  upon  completion  of  the  project,  the  additional  PIU  staff  will  be \nintegrated into the DOW. \n \n18.  The project will be implemented over 5 years, with completion by December 2016. To \nexpedite  implementation,  the  DOW  has  requested  and  ADB  has  approved  advance \nprocurement action for the engagement of a project implementation support consultant who will \nbe  responsible  for  detailed  design,  construction  supervision,  and  overall  implementation \nsupport. ADB has informed the government that approval of advance action does not commit \nADB to finance the project.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n19.  A number of major bridges on all five priority national roads, particularly on the Ramu \nand New Britain highways, could not be considered under the project as their current location is \nnot suitable because of changing river hydrology. Detailed hydrological and geotechnical field \ninvestigations  are  needed  before  a  decision  can  be taken  regarding  the  location  of these \nbridges.  In  some  cases,  landslides  and  other  similar  phenomena  upstream  cause  major \nchanges in the river flow, requiring more innovative bridge designs. Grant-financed policy and \nadvisory TA is attached to the loans to undertake the studies and prepare recommendations for \nthe location and design of major bridges. The recommendations will enable the inclusion of \nmajor  bridges  in  future  phases.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $900,000.  ADB  will  finance \n$800,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The \ngovernment will provide $100,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and \nother expenditures. The DOW will be the executing agency and the TA will be implemented \nfrom January to June 2013.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  The project will benefit the largely rural population of about 400,000 in the provinces of \nCentral, Madang, East Sepik, and West and East New Britain along the five priority national \nroads. The economic analysis is based on analyzing cost and benefits streams with and without \nthe project over 25 years and discounted at 12%. The economic analysis was undertaken for \n27 high-ranked  bridges  on  the  selected  five  priority  roads.  The  quantified  benefits  include \nsavings  of  vehicle  operating  costs  and  value  of  time  from  avoiding  traffic  slowdown  and \ncongestion on existing bridges, and disruption following the failure of the existing bridges. In \naddition, the analysis considers benefits from reduced maintenance costs and improved safety \nof the new two-lane permanent structures. The economic internal rate of return for the project is \n15.5% and the economic net present value is $20.3 million. Sensitivity analysis involving a 20% \ndecrease in benefits and a 20% increase in costs shows that the economic internal rate of \nreturn remains close to 12%. The use of old Bailey bridges from national roads to improve \naccess on rural roads will result in benefits to rural communities that cannot be quantified. \nAmong others, these include increased access to economic activities and education and health \nfacilities.         \n \n21.

An analysis of projected expenditure was undertaken to \nevaluate the impact of the project on planned transport sector funding, including an assessment \nof  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  absorb  the  investment  financing  and  determine  if  sufficient \nresource planning has been undertaken to sustain project activities. While the government is \ntaking a number of steps to ensure the long-term sustainability of infrastructure projects, the \nloan agreement will include assurances for counterpart and recurrent funding to be provided. \nThis will ensure that the appropriate level of resources will be made available in the medium and \nlong term to sustain project activities. \n \n22.  To ensure the long-term sustainability of road projects, the National Roads Authority \n(NRA) was established in 2003 to (i) raise funds for the maintenance of public roads; (ii) ensure \nthe efficient preparation of effective annual road maintenance programs; and (iii) ensure that all \nroad maintenance is executed in a transparent, effective, and efficient manner. In 2009, the \nNRA had revenue of K18.3 million, primarily raised through a small fuel levy on diesel, with \nabout K67 million in reserves. Over 2,000 km of the national roads were transferred to the NRA, \nincluding significant sections of the five priority national roads included in the project. The NRA \nis maintaining some of the nominated sections but needs additional resources. To increase the \nNRA\u2019s funding and ensure its long-term sustainability, work is ongoing to increase the fuel levy, \nand introduce additional license fee for heavy vehicles, and other road user charges.15  \n \n23.  For road networks at provincial and district levels, the government provides a transport \ninfrastructure maintenance grant as a block allocation to each province. The government is \ncommitted to increasing the grants and appropriated K45 million for this purpose in 2010 to \nincrease provinces\u2019 fiscal capacity to meet their transport infrastructure maintenance expenses. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n24.  The DOW has implemented several projects funded by development partners, including \nprojects financed by ADB. A capacity assessment of the current PIU within the DOW concluded \nthat project management arrangements are reasonably robust, though some strengthening for \nthis project is recommended.  \n \n25.  Financial control procedures for the PIU follow the Department of Finance\u2019s financial \nmanagement manual. No significant financial management issues have been raised in external \naudit reports, or in other reports used by the DOW and key stakeholders for monitoring existing \nPIU projects. The financial management arrangements in place at the PIU will continue to be \nfollowed for this project. The PSC will ensure coordination across all aspects of the project.  \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  DOW.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  PNG ranks 149 out of 179 countries in the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s \nHuman  Development  Index. With  87%  of  the  population  living  in  rural  areas,  the  poverty \nincidence is higher in rural than urban areas. Given the reliance on subsistence farming in most \nrural areas, the nature of rural poverty relates more to a lack of access to basic social services \nsuch as education and health facilities, and lack of income-earning opportunities, rather than \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2010.

Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Improving Road User \nCharges and Private Sector Participation in Road Development. Manila (TA 7420). \n ", "8   \nextreme hunger or destitution. Access to basic social services is especially constrained in rural \nareas  because  of  poor  infrastructure  coverage,  including  road  connectivity  and  transport \nservices.  \n \n28.  The project will contribute to poverty reduction and socioeconomic development in the \nproject areas by improving the access of the rural population to livelihood opportunities and \nbasic social services, reducing their travel time, and making these essential trips safer. The \nimproved  accessibility  will  increase  the  economic  opportunities  of  poor  rural  households, \npromote school attendance among children, and improve health outcomes among women and \nchildren by facilitating access to health facilities.   \n \n29.  The  project  is  classified  \u201ceffective  gender  mainstreaming.\u201d  Bridge  designs  will  take \nwomen\u2019s safety concerns in road travel into consideration, and relocation of usable Bailey \nbridges will incorporate access to health facilities and schools into selection criteria. Women will \nbe engaged in semi-skilled labor for construction and bridge maintenance activities to provide \nincome-earning opportunities. The road safety awareness campaigns will address personal \nsafety concerns of women and children in road travel. A gender action plan has been prepared \nand  the  PIU  will  monitor  its  implementation,  supported  by  the  implementation  support \nconsultant. They will collect and analyze sex-disaggregated data in monitoring project activities \nas well as the gender action plan.  \n  \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Environmental. The project is classified category B according to ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). An environmental assessment review framework has been prepared \nthat presents the general anticipated environmental impacts of the project, selection criteria, and \nenvironmental procedures for undertaking both replacement and reassembly of bridges. An \ninitial  environmental  examination,  including  an  environmental  management  plan,  has  been \nprepared for the five selected priority roads. The DOW has formally submitted the five initial \nenvironmental  examinations  and  environmental  assessment  review  framework  to  the \nDepartment of Environment and Conservation for information. Approval is not required under \nPNG law.  \n \n31.  The construction phase impacts will be temporary and primarily related to increased \nwater turbidity associated with pile-driving, excavation, and river training works. No significant \noperational impacts are expected. Mitigating measures have been developed, focusing on good \ninternational  construction  practices.  With  appropriate  mitigation  measures,  environmental \nimpacts associated with the project are expected to be minor, site-specific, and temporary. The \nimplementation  support  consultant  team  will  include  an  environmental  specialist  who  will \nmonitor implementation of the environmental management plan. The environmental specialist \nwill  also  provide  on-the-job  training  and  capacity  building  of  DOW  staff  in  the  areas  of \nenvironmental mitigation, environmental monitoring, and occupational health and safety.  \n \n32.  Climate  change  is  expected  to  have  implications  on  the  hydrologic  and  hydraulic \nproperties  of  the  bridge  sites.  The  bridge  design  will  incorporate  climate  change  impacts, \nparticularly  changes  in the frequency  and  intensity  of floods. The  ongoing  TA  will  help  in \nestimating present and future climatic conditions for bridge designs and for climate-proofing of \nthe project.16   \n \n                                                \n16 A study of the climate change impacts on bridge design and recommendations for climate proofing of the bridges \nunder the project is under way, financed through ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Promoting Climate Change \nAdaptation in Asia and the Pacific. Manila.  ", "   9 \n33.  Social  safeguards.  The  project  has  been  classified  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. It is not expected to involve physical displacement of \npeople. It will, however, require acquisition of land for replacement of some bridges, resulting in \nloss of crops and trees on that land, and relocation of roadside food markets at some locations. \nResettlement plans have been prepared for each of the five selected priority national roads \nincluded in the project, based on the assessment of impacts and consultations with affected \nlandowners. The resettlement plans include measures to compensate for affected land and \nassets, and to assist affected persons to restore and improve their livelihoods. A resettlement \nframework has been prepared, providing guidelines on screening, assessment, and preparation \nof resettlement plans, if needed, for replacement of bridges on national roads and reassembly of \nBailey bridges on rural roads that will be selected during implementation. Affected landowners \nand  local  stakeholders  have  been  consulted  and  provided  relevant  information  during \npreparation of the resettlement plans. The DOW has endorsed the resettlement framework and \nresettlement plans that have been disclosed locally and posted on the ADB website.     \n \n34.  A  social  assessment  concluded  that  ethnic  groups  in  the  project  area  are  primary \nbeneficiaries  of the  project  and  not  distinct  or  vulnerable  compared to  PNG\u2019s  mainstream \npopulation, which is mostly made up of Melanesians. The leaders of local communities/clans \nfrom potential project sites have expressed support for the project. The overall project design, \nparticularly  the  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans,  ensure  that  they  receive \nculturally appropriate benefits and actively participate in the project activities.  \n \n35.  The  DOW  and  provincial  governments  will  assign  lands  officers  to  manage  land \nacquisition and resettlement activities. The implementation support consultant team will include \nan international resettlement specialist and a national resettlement specialist to assist the DOW \nand provincial governments to manage social safeguard aspects. The consultant team will \nprovide necessary safeguard training to relevant government staff involved in land acquisition \nand resettlement.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n36.
