During  the  2007  Country  Programming  Mission  for  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC), the Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a technical \nassistance1 (TA) to support the Government\u2019s preparation of the proposed Jiangxi Sustainable \nForest Ecosystem Development Project (the Project) for ADB financing. \n \n2.  ADB fielded reconnaissance and fact-finding missions in April 2008 and July 2008, \nrespectively. The missions met with national and provincial officials, and other key stakeholders; \nand reached agreement on the TA output, outcome, implementation arrangements, cost and \nfinancing plan, and terms of reference of the consultants. The TA concept paper was approved \non 25 July 2008. This TA paper has been prepared based on the understandings reached \nbetween  ADB  missions  and  the  Government,  and  comments  received  during  ADB\u2019s \ninterdepartmental review.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2006\u20132010) emphasizes the need to build a \nharmonious  and  moderately  prosperous  society  which  will  be  resource-efficient  and \nenvironment-friendly. ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy 2008\u20132010 (CPS)2 and Long-Term \nStrategic Framework 2008\u20132020 \u201cStrategy 2020\u201d3 support measures aimed at promoting the \nsustainable management of forests to better adapt to the challenges of a broad range of \nenvironmental issues such as climate change. Forests play a critical role in influencing the \nEarth\u2019s climate. Forest plants and soils drive the global carbon cycle by sequestering carbon \ndioxide through photosynthesis and releasing it through respiration. It is estimated that forest \nand land-use measures have the potential to reduce the global net carbon emissions by the \nequivalent of 10\u201320% of projected fossil fuel emissions through 2050. Research in the PRC has \nshown that one hectare (ha) of forest could store 245.6 tons of water, preserve 67.8 tons of \nfertilizer, and reduce soil erosion by 33.9 tons. It was also estimated that the carbon storage \ncapacity of forests could be as high as 70 tons/ha. \n \n4.  The PRC has been a forest-deficit country despite its forest cover of about 175 million ha \nand a standing timber stock of about 12.5 billion cubic meters (m3). While the PRC\u2019s forest \ncover  has  increased  to  18.2%  of  the  total  land  area  in  2006  due  to  extensive  plantation \nprograms since the early 1980s, the PRC\u2019s per capita forested area is only 0.13 ha, far below \nthe world average of 0.65 ha. The standing stock volume amounts to less than 10 m3 per capita, \nwhich is also significantly lower than the world average of 66 m3. The Government has adopted \na  series  of  reforms  in  forestry  policies  since  the  1980s  to  address  the  issues  of  timber \nproduction, forest resources conservation, and ecosystem restoration. These forestry policies \nand reforms include the amendment of the Forest Law of 1998, the Natural Forest Protection \nProgram of 1998, the Six National Key Forest Programs of 2000, and the Forest Land Reform of \n2007. Such policies and reforms reflect a shift of forestry policy from resource exploitation to \nresource protection and have helped the PRC to successfully increase its forest area and timber \nstock over the last 2 decades. The rapid economic growth has escalated the country\u2019s demand \nfor wood fiber and forest products which oftentimes have to be imported from abroad, especially \nfrom the neighboring Southeast Asian countries.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 August 2008. \n2  ADB. 2008.Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China  (2008\u20132010). Manila. \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank (2008\u20132020). \nManila. \n ", "2   \n5.  Jiangxi is an underdeveloped mountainous province with a total area of 16.69 million ha. \nThe provincial gross domestic product (GDP) was only CNY467 billion in 2006, about 2.2% of \nthe national GDP; per capita GDP of CNY10,000, which is about 62% of the national average; \nand rural per capita net income of CNY3,585, which is about 22% of the national average. \nAbout 5% of the population still live below the poverty line of $1/day, of whom most are \npeasants living in the mountainous areas. In 2001, approximately 64% or 10.63 million ha of the \nland was designated as forest land, of which one third was classified as national or provincial \npublic welfare forest lands for strict protection and conservation. The province is within the \nfourth  forest  region  according  to  the  State  Forestry  Administration\u2019s  classification  in  2005, \nmeaning the provincial government is required to improve the quality and quantity of forest \nmanagement,  and  enhance  the  protection  of  the  ecological  environment.  Due  to  the  low \nprovincial GDP, the Jiangxi Provincial Government (JPG) has not been able to secure sufficient \nfinancial resources to meet the investment needs for forestry development. \n \n6.  Jiangxi Province lies in the eastern part of the PRC to the south of the middle-lower \nreach of the Yangtze River. The area has a warm and humid climate with plentiful rain and \nsunshine year round. The average annual temperature is around 16.3oC \u201319.5oC, and the mean \nannual  precipitation  is  1,351\u20131,934  millimeters.  The  soil  in  the  province  is  mostly  40\u2013100 \ncentimeters (cm) thick with a humus layer of 8\u201320 cm. The mild weather and fertile soil provide \nan environment suitable for tree growth and forest development. Jiangxi Province\u2019s forested \narea ranks second in the country. However, the development of forest resources is stagnant \nmainly due to (i) historical overexploitation of forest resources that has deteriorated the forest \nstructure and quality,4 and (ii) lack of sufficient funding for forest development. Fifteen percent or \n1.6 million ha of the forest lands are under open forest lands, shrublands, and barren mountains \nwhich are low-yielding and underutilized. The high percentage of underutilized forest lands in \nthe province is not only a waste of land resources but also causes serious environmental \nproblems such as soil erosion, siltation, and flooding to the downstream Boyang Hu Lake and \nYangtze River. The devastating flood in the Yangtze River in 1998 caused the Government to \nshift its forestry policy from resource exploitation to resource protection to reverse soil erosion \nand minimize other environmental problems in watershed management.  \n \n7.  JPG launched its Forest Land Tenure Reform in 2004 and distributed 13.448 million mu5  \nof collective forest lands to 6.916 million farm households who acquired management rights of \nthe forest lands. The Forest Land Tenure Reform helped privatize and commercialize forestry \ndevelopment in the Jiangxi Province. This has accelerated the development of forestry sector in \nthe province and improved rural livelihoods. As a result, the total forest area was 3.524 million \nmu in 2006, the highest over the past 10 years, of which private sector plantations including \nenterprises and individual farms planted 2.637 million mu. Further in 2006, JPG issued a \nprovincial order to develop \u201cSix Systems and One Center\u201d to strengthen the land tenure reform \nincluding  a  forestry  resources  management  system;  a  forestry  industry  system;  a  forestry \ninvestment and financing system; a forestry science and technology service system; a forestry \npolicy, strategy, and regulation system; a forestry insurance system; and a forestry property \nright  trade  center  system.  Fifty  county  forestry  trade  and  information  centers  have  been \nestablished since then. These centers provide services on forest land tenure and property \nregistration, information disclosure, legal consultation, and forestry property and product trading. \nSuch services facilitate the participation of the private sector and help develop an open, fair, and \ntransparent market for forest land tenure and product trading at the county and provincial levels.  \n \n                                                 \n4  The composition of tree species and live stand age are below standards, and the capacity of forest management is \nyet to be improved. The average crown density of stands is less than 50%; and the forest stock volume per unit \narea is only 44.5% of the national average, ranking 19th in the country. \n5  1 mu = 1/15 hectare. \n ", "  3\n8.  According to provincial statistics, there were 5,793 wood processing enterprises in 2006, \nof which 32 were listed as provincial leading enterprises involved in wood, bamboo, camellia oil \nprocessing, forestation, and tea, fruit, and medicinal herb processing. About 4.6 million m3 of \nforestry products were produced including timber, fuel wood, and bamboo. The total value of \nforest outputs was CNY48 billion. It was estimated that the capacity of the timber processing \nindustry would reach about 5 million m3, and the annual forestry product consumption of 7.64 \nmillion m3 by 2008. To meet the consumption demand for forestry products, JPG has to import \nforest products from outside of the province; and accelerate public and private investments in \nforestry industry in the province.  \n \n9.  It is JPG\u2019s long-term goal to achieve a forest coverage of 63%, forest stock volume of \n750 million m3, average forestry production of 90 m3/ha, and total forestry output of CNY160 \nbillion by 2020. To accomplish these goals, JPG will need to plant 12 million mu of commercial \nforest, 9 million mu of Moso bamboo forest, and 5 million mu of camellia oil plantation during its \n11th FYP period (2006\u20132010).   \n \n10.  JPG has been receiving financial support to improve forest plantation, research and \nstudies, capacity building, and environmental management since the 1990s. The World Bank \nprovided around $64 million during 1990\u20132005 to assist in the implementation of the National \nAfforestation Program, the Forestry Resources Development and Protection Program, and the \nForestry Development in Poor Areas. The World Bank projects helped develop 191,400 ha of \nforest lands in 69 counties.  Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau provided \u20ac8.69 million during 1998\u2013\n2003 to assist six counties in forestation of 37,033 ha of forest lands. The Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation6 provides  approximately  $60  million  during  2004\u20132009  for  forest \nplantations development on 219,203 ha and institution building in 36 counties.  \n \n11.  A recent evaluation report7 on forest conservation programs in the PRC pointed out that \nforestry programs with major environmental objectives had to consider poverty and livelihoods \nsimultaneously.  Lessons  learned  from  an  ADB  forest  project  in  the  PRC8 showed  that \ncomprehensive  capacity  development  was  important  to  ensure  long-term  economic  and \nfinancial viability of the pulp mill enterprise. Another evaluation report9 further suggested that \nsuccessful  poverty  reduction  interventions  linked  the  poor  to  economic  growth  centers, \ncommercial value-adding enterprises, and associated off-farm employment opportunities. ADB\u2019s \nexperiences with forestry projects10 indicated that local ownership and understanding of local \nforest knowledge and practices were critical to the success of introducing new techniques on \ntimber harvesting and reforestation. The World Bank\u2019s evaluation report11 concluded that the \nPRC\u2019s forest work and management had been remarkably successful mainly due to the high \npriority accorded by the Government to forestry sector development and a high level of project \nownership including staff capacity, and adequate and timely provision of budgetary resources.   \n \n12.  The external support from various development partners has enhanced the techniques \nof reforestation and improved the knowledge of forestry management in the Jiangxi provincial \n                                                 \n6  The Japan Bank of International Cooperation was realigned with the Japan International Cooperation Agency on 1 \nOctober 2008. \n7  ADB. 2007.

JPG is yet to achieve its goal of forestry development set \nout in the 11th FYP which requires the Government to invest more than CNY4 billion and provide \ntechnical support to local governments for reforestation and forest management. JPG is, thus, \nrequesting ADB to provide financing and technical assistance, in addition to the support from \nother international financing agencies, to continue its efforts in sustainable forest development \nand facilitate private sector participation in the forestry industry.  \n \n13.  A devastating snow storm hit the province in January 2008 which worsened JPG\u2019s fiscal \ncapacity in meeting the investment needs of the forestry sector. The snow storm affected about \n53.5 million mu of forest lands including shelter forests, timber forests, and bamboo forests; and \ncaused a direct economic loss of CNY1,126 billion. Many natural reserves and scenic spots \nwere also severely damaged. Over 4 million mu of forest land will need to be reforested, and the \nforest ecosystem needs to be restored. The snow storm incident reveals some hidden issues of \nforest management in Jiangxi, which are (i) the lack of sustainable forest product supply in the \nprovince due to weak forest management strategies, and (ii) the lack of state-of-art forest \nmanagement practices to protect forest resources from natural disastrous damages, such as \nclimate change adaptation and forest insurance mechanism. Due to the lack of clear policy and \nstrategies on forest insurance, public awareness, and adequate expertise in the province, the \ninsurance mechanism is yet to be developed. \n \n14.   The proposed sustainable forest ecosystem development project will (i) improve forest \nplantation  and  forest  resources  management  by  introducing  practices  of  climate  change \nadaptation to the project area to ensure the sustainability of forest yields in the province, which \nwill also alleviate pressure on neighboring countries\u2019 forest resources in the region, and (ii) \nintroducing  a  proper  forest  insurance  system  to  minimize  disastrous  damages  to  forest \nresources. The TA and the ensuing investment project are in line with ADB\u2019s Forest Policy \n(1995), 12  and  the  core  areas  of  operations  in  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,  which  includes \nenvironmental  measures  such  as  arresting  deforestation  and  sustainable  management  of \nforests to address climate change. The amount of the ensuing loan is estimated as $40 million \nwhich is included in the 2010 assistance program of the ADB\u2019s CPS.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n15.   The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  improved  forest  management  and  environmental \nsustainability in the Jiangxi Province. The TA outcome will be a project design suitable for ADB \nfinancing  and  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  A  participatory  approach  will  be  adopted  during  the  TA  implementation  to  solicit \nstakeholders\u2019 views and suggestions on the project design and implementation mechanism. A \ntotal of 24 counties have indicated interest in participating in the Project. Consultants will be \nengaged to (i) identify sector issues with manageable solution, and explore opportunities for \npromoting low-carbon growth and private sector participation in forest development; (ii) evaluate \nthe rationale and justifications of the proposed investment activities; (iii) prepare safeguard \ndocuments and a knowledge product on forest land rehabilitation to facilitate policy dialogue; (iv) \nset up a geographic information system (GIS) for use in selected counties; (v) conduct training \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 1995.

An  overseas  training  on \nsustainable forest management and climate change adaptation will be conducted in an Asia \nPacific region country for a maximum of five people from JPG. The Project will also explore the \npossibility of cofinancing with the Global Environment Facility or ADB\u2019s Climate Change Fund to \nsupport climate change adaptation and mitigation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The  total  TA  cost  is  estimated  at  $826,000  equivalent,  of  which  $700,000  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 3. The PRC Government will finance the remaining $126,000 equivalent in \nlocal currency through in-kind contributions. The Government has been informed that approval \nof the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  JPG will establish a TA leading group, which will be chaired by the Vice Governor in \ncharge of forestry, and will comprise high level officials from the Departments of Forestry and \nFinance, and the Provincial Development and Reform Commission. The leading group will \nprovide overall policy and strategic guidance during TA implementation. The Department of \nForestry will be the executing agency, and responsible for TA implementation. Specifically, the \nexecuting  agency  will  (i)  prepare  a  feasibility  study  report  and  environmental  report  in \ncompliance with the Government\u2019s requirements, (ii) oversee the preparation of the investment \nplan, (iii) coordinate TA activities of participating counties, (iv) assist TA consultants to secure all \nthe reports and data needed for TA implementation, and (v) secure all the necessary internal \napprovals  for  the  feasibility  study  report  and  related  documents.  The  participating  county \ngovernments  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  and  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  conducting \nstakeholder consultations and assisting in social surveys, (ii) providing baseline data of the \ncounty subprojects, and (iii) providing comments on the project design. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 7 months, from February to September 2009. The TA \nwill require approximately 42 person-months of consulting services including 13 person-months \nof international consulting services and 29 person-months of national consulting services. The \noutline terms of reference for consulting services is in Appendix 4. A consulting firm will be \nselected according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The quality- and cost-based selection procedure (with quality-cost ratio of 80:20) \nwill be applied based on biodata technical proposal. Two resource persons may be recruited by \nADB using single source selection to conduct special studies and training on climate change \nadaptation and the use of GIS in sustainable forest management. Equipment will be procured \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The consulting \nfirm will submit an inception report, an interim report, and a draft final report within the first, \nfourth, and sixth months, respectively. A final report will be submitted within the seventh month \nafter incorporating the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s comments.  \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Jiangxi Sustainable Forest \nEcosystem Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved forest  Increased forest cover by  JPG annual statistical reports  \u2022  Forecasts of demands for \nmanagement and  1% in the project area by    forest products are \nenvironmental  2015.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe \nhow the Project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction; and how it is linked to the poverty reduction \nstrategy of the partner country. \n \nThe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  prioritizes \nenvironmentally sustainable and inclusive rural development through the New Socialist Countryside Policy. To support \nthe PRC Government achieve its goals, the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Country Partnership Strategy for the \nPRC (2008\u20132010) sets out its key priorities which include (i) enhanced inclusiveness through balanced development \nwith a focus on rural and poorer regions, and (ii) environmental sustainability through more effective natural resources \nmanagement. The PRC has achieved remarkable results in overall poverty reduction over the last three decades but \nsignificant pockets of poverty persist. Nationally, poor people mostly live in the central and western provinces that lag \nbehind the eastern provinces in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In these regions, poor people live mainly \nin remote rural areas where poverty is strongly correlated to the degradation of natural resources.  \n \nJiangxi is an underdeveloped mountainous province. The provincial gross domestic product (GDP) was only CNY467 \nbillion, which is about 2.2% of the national GDP, and the GDP per capita just reached CNY10,000 in 2006, which is \nabout 62% of the national average. The per capita annual net income of rural residents was only CNY3,585; only 22% \nof the national average. Approximately 5% of the population still lives below the poverty line of $1/day. Most of the poor \nare farmers living in the mountainous areas. The Project, thus, aims to improve forest management efficiency including \nincrease of forest yield, forest cover, and farmers\u2019 income by (i) introducing short cycle commercial forests, (ii) \nimproving low-yield Moso bamboo forests, (iii) introducing high-value economic forests, and (iv) capacity building on \nsustainable forest management. This will result in balanced development whereby rural farmers increase their income \nthrough lease of their forest land or sales of raw materials while ensuring environmental sustainability.  \n \nB.  Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the Project: \n General Intervention (GI)     Individual or Household (TI-H)   \n Geographic (TI-G)       Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nAs described above, about 5% of the total population in the Jiangxi Province still lives below the poverty line of $1 per \nday, most of whom are farmers living in the mountainous areas. The Project aims to benefit these people by investing \nin sustainable forestry which is the primary industry for these people. However, given the complexity of the forestry \nindustry, need for sufficient forest land, and need to secure market accessibility, management cannot only target the \npoor but must involve a variety of stakeholders such as forest management enterprises, state-owned forest farms, and \nother public forest farms. The Project is, therefore, classified as a general intervention. \n  \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n  Not applicable    \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence?                   \n  Not applicable \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross-subsidy, pro-\npoor governance, and pro-poor growth)? \nA key design feature builds on the findings of a recent ADB evaluation of poverty exit achievements which highlighted \nthe success from linking the rural poor to commercial value-adding enterprises. The Project applies this through \nsupporting  forest  management  enterprises,  state-owned  forest  farms,  other  public  forest  farms,  and  farmer \nassociations located in the project area; and applying poverty-targeting criteria to extend assistance to the poorer \nfarmers. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \n \nBased on existing information: \n \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? \n \nPrimary beneficiaries are the communities, primarily poor, who use the natural resources from the mountains for their \nliving. Of the total forest lands, 85% is managed jointly or individually by the farmers. Based on the profit-sharing ratio \nbetween the land users and forest land owner, they are expected to receive 35% of the total benefits. Additional \nincome is likely to be gained through provision of services to enterprises and farms. The process and the outcome of \nthe Project will benefit the poor in several ways. First, inclusive participatory approach will be adopted in the project \ndesign process. This provides the poor people opportunities to provide inputs into critical decision making for natural \nresource management that has direct impact on their livelihoods. Local government officials and consultants will \nmonitor and ensure the quality of participation. Second, more managed use of natural resources minimizes their social \nvulnerability. And finally, improving the cooperation between farmers and forest farms, forest management enterprises, \nand farmer associations would give farmers better access to market, thus, increasing their income.   \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nThe Project entails two new activities for the local communities\u2013introduction of fast-growing forestation for raw \nmaterials and high-value economic forest. As farmers may not be fully familiar with the necessary technical skills, they \nwill need a significant amount of capacity building.  If they are to enter into partnership with forest farms or manage the \nresources collectively, they will also need to be provided with marketing, accounting, and negotiation skills training.  \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \n \nOne potential constraint is that collaboration between farmers and forest farms or enterprises may not work as well as \nexpected. In order to address this issue, the project design will include opportunities for public participation and conduct \na thorough consultation with all stakeholders. Moreover, the government will establish a course of redress and dispute \nresolution mechanism where farmers (or the enterprises and farms) can channel their complaints. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nFarmers, community members utilizing the land or natural resources in the forest land, farmer associations, forest \nfarms, forest enterprises, and staff of executing agency and implementing agencies.  \n \n2.  What  type  of  consultation  and  participation  is  required  during  the  PPTA  or  project  processing  (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \n \nCommunity members, farmer associations, farms, and enterprises will be consulted in identifying their needs and views \non the Project which will then be reflected on the design. \n  \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n Information sharing     Consultation   Collaborative decision making   Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?   Yes   No  Please explain.  \n \nFarmers and community consultation and participation is critical to ensure the project sustainability. A consultation and \nparticipation plan will be prepared. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or \nprogram? \n \nBased on existing information provided by the Jiangxi provincial government and others, there seem to be no project-\nspecific gender issues. The Project may be confronted with generic gender issues in the rural PRC, not specific to the \nsector or subsector. This could be insufficient participation of women in community decision-making process or limited \naccess to employment opportunities and income, both exacerbating their social vulnerability.  \n \n2.  Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation \nin decision making?    Yes   No  Please explain.  \n \nThe Project could increase women\u2019s participation in decision-making regarding natural resources management and \nimprove their access to income through contracts with farmers or enterprises. However, the Project intends to provide \nbenefits on a household basis rather than on specific members of the households.  \n \n3.  Could the proposed Project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n     Yes   No  Please explain.  \n \nThe Project will be implemented in a community participatory manner where views of different stakeholders will be \nreflected in the project design to the extent possible. It is the project policy to fully engage the women in the project \ndesign. Therefore, no adverse impact will emanate from the Project. \n  \nIII.
