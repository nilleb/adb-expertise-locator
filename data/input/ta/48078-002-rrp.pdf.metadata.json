I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Second Power \nTransmission Enhancement Investment Program.1  \n \n2.  The  proposed  investment  program  will  expand  and  reinforce  Pakistan\u2019s  power \ntransmission system, enabling it to provide a reliable and quality service capable of meeting \nincreasing  customer  demand  and  supporting  economic  growth.  The  investment  program \nconsists of staged physical investments in the transmission system, including the rehabilitation, \naugmentation, and expansion of transmission lines, substations, and supporting infrastructure. \nThe physical investments will support evacuation of new generation, including renewables; \nimprove system reliability and quality of supply through reinforcement and improved monitoring \nand control; and meet increasing consumer demand. The capacity development component will \nfurther improve the financial management, regulatory relations, planning, project management, \nand  procurement  capacity  of  the  transmission  system  owner  and  operator,  the  National \nTransmission and Despatch Company Limited (NTDC), and the sector\u2019s newly established \ncommercial operator, the Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G). \nThese investments will increase institutional efficiency, cost recovery, competition, transparency, \nand good governance within the power sector.2  \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale  \n3.  Strategic context. A reliable and sustainable energy sector is essential to the economic \ngrowth and well-being of Pakistan. A persistent gap between the end-user and cost-recovery \ntariffs has led to an enduring shortfall in funds within the sector. As a result there has been \ninsufficient investment across the sector.3 The average daily shortfall is 4,500\u20136,000 megawatts \n(MW), resulting in routine load shedding of 8\u201310 hours per day in urban areas and up to 18\u201320 \nhours per day in rural areas.4 Chronic power shortages constrain gross domestic product and \npoverty  reduction,  and  increases  security  issues  and  social  unrest.  The  rural  poor  are \ndisproportionately affected by the shortages because of their dependence on agriculture. The \nagriculture sector employs 44% of the labor force, of which  74% are women.5 Insufficient \ninvestment  in  the  transmission  system,  which  links  generation  to  large  end  users  and \ndistribution companies, has resulted in an overloaded system that is incapable of providing the \nreliable and quality supply required by the national grid code. The overloaded transmission \nsystem has contributed to major blackouts and supply constraints experienced by end users.6 \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to Pakistan for the Power Transmission Enhancement Investment Program II. \nManila.  \n3  The government\u2019s targeted average cost of generation is $0.10/kilowatt-hour (kWh), down from $0.12/kWh in 2013. \nThis compares with an average notified user tariff of $0.11/kWh. The government has not passed on the cost of \nelectricity to consumers for sociopolitical reasons. The gap between the end-user and cost-recovery tariffs is the \ndifference between (i) cost recovery and National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA)-determined tariffs, \nand (ii) NEPRA-determined and government-notified tariffs. Tariff structure is being addressed in concert with the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank through a combined systematic program approach. \n4  NEPRA. 2015. State of Industry Report 2014. Islamabad.   \n5  M. Shahbaz. 2015. Measuring Economic Cost of Electricity Shortage: Current Challenges and Future Prospects in \nPakistan. Working Paper 2015-002. Lahore.   \n6  NEPRA. 2015. Performance Evaluation Report. Islamabad. \n ", "2 \n \n4.  Sector  structure.  Pakistan\u2019s  power  sector  consists  of  10  regional  distribution \ncompanies, four thermal and one hydro generation company, NTDC, and CPPA-G, which are \ngovernment-owned. The private sector owns 48.5% of the 23,663 MW of installed generation \ncapacity,  and  K-Electric,  which  is  responsible  for  power  generation  and  distribution  in  the \nKarachi area.  The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) determines tariffs, \nissues licenses, and regulates the energy sector to ensure its long-term sustainability.  The \nMinistry of Water and Power sets policy, including the tariffs paid by consumers. \n \n5.  In 2015, the central power purchasing agency division of the NTDC was separated and \nestablished as the CPPA-G. The new entity provides a transparent settlement system for the \npower sector, which will evolve into a competitive electricity pricing platform as the regulatory \nframework develops.7 In addition, the government has released policy frameworks to encourage \nprivate sector investment in transmission projects, and regulations to facilitate third party access \nto the existing transmission system. The proposed investment program will assist the NTDC and \nCPPA-G to operationalize the new market structure and comply with evolving regulations. \n \n6.  Sector strategy and road map. The government\u2019s strategy to address the persistent \nenergy crisis is set out in Vision 2025, Pakistan\u2019s comprehensive vision for economic growth.8 \nVision 2025 aims to (i) increase new power generation with a more balanced generation mix, \n(ii) provide uninterrupted electricity to all, (iii) increase electricity access to 90% of the population \nby 2025, and (iv) improve demand management. This is supported by the 2013 National Power \nPolicy (NPP), a broad energy sector policy, which includes a detailed assessment of the issues \nand an action plan to address them (para. 8).9 The NTDC has a detailed long-term investment \nplan to support the policy actions, which addresses the physical investments required (para. 9). \nThe  nonphysical  investments,  including  policy  reforms  and  broader  sector  issues,  are \naddressed  under  the  government\u2019s  energy  sector  policy  reforms.  This  provides  a  strong \nstrategic, policy, and investment program to implement the sector reforms.10 \n   \n7.  The proposed MFF supports the reforms through the expansion and reinforcement of the \ntransmission backbone, which is required to meet quality and reliability of supply standards and \nservice  the  increasing  customer  demand.  Investments  in  advanced  control  equipment  and \nsystem  strengthening  are  also  required  to  facilitate  the  government\u2019s  targeted  increase  in \nrenewable  energy  generation.  Policy  reforms,  including  increased  institutional  efficiency, \ncompetition,  transparency,  and  good  governance  are  supported  through  the  capacity \ndevelopment  component.  Operationalization  of  the  CPPA-G,  which  is  essential  for  the \ndevelopment of a transparent and efficient power sector, is also supported. \n \n8.  Policy framework. The NPP aims to apply the principles of efficiency, competition, and \nsustainability  to  establish  an  efficient,  consumer-focused  power  sector  that  is  capable  of \nmeeting the needs of Pakistan and boosting the economy in a sustainable and affordable \nmanner.  Key  strategies  include  (i)  expanding  and  strengthening  the  transmission  grid  to \nincrease access and improve the quality and reliability of supply; (ii) reducing losses through \nimproved  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  improved  monitoring  equipment  and \nsoftware; and (iii) establishing transparency and controls for dispatch and payment. The need to \nimprove governance, rationalize energy prices, ensure the efficient use of energy such as \nreducing technical losses in transmission and distribution systems, and rehabilitate the aging \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

Investment program. Prior to the start of each year, NTDC prepares an investment and \npower  procurement  program  (IPPP),  outlining  the  staged  physical  investments  in  the \ntransmission  system,  for  the  approval  of  NEPRA.12 Each  IPPP  will  include  the  physical \ninvestments planned for the power transmission system for the next 5 to 10 years.13 The MFF \nwill support physical investments detailed in the IPPP approved by NEPRA from time to time. \nSpecific projects will be selected based on their readiness (including in respect of required \ngovernment approvals; procurement; and technical, economic, and financial feasibility); and \ncompliance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) requirements. The NTDC\u2019s 2016\u20132026 IPPP \n \nincludes physical investments in excess of $11.0 billion.\n \n10.  The MFF\u2019s nonphysical investments support the NPP by assisting the NTDC and CPPA-\nG  to  achieve  institutional  efficiency,  cost  recovery,  competition,  transparency,  and  good \ngovernance. A capacity development plan will be prepared under tranche 1 to identify the \ntraining, resources, and capacity support required for the successful implementation of this MFF, \nincluding  the  (i)  planning,  construction,  operation,  maintenance,  and  management  of  the \ntransmission system; and (ii) segregation and transfer of certain functions from the NTDC to the \nCPPA-G, and the ongoing operationalization of the CPPA-G. A facility management consultant \nwill be engaged to assist the NTDC in preparing subsequent tranches, and in implementing and \nmonitoring the MFF. Additional resources will be engaged to assist the NTDC and CPPA-G to \nupdate their internal procedures and policies to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. \n \n11.  ADB  interventions.  The proposed investment program supports ADB\u2019s Sustainable \nEnergy Sector Reform Program through targeted loss reduction, regulatory compliance, and \nimproved tariff submission processes.14 The expansion and reinforcement of the transmission \nsystem provides the critical connecting infrastructure required for the successful use of ADB \nsupport in generation, renewables, and distribution subsectors. The investment program is \naligned with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, country partnership strategy for Pakistan, and the Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020.15  It is included in the country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 \nfor  Pakistan,  and  is  consistent  with  the  Development  Coordination  Framework.16 It  is  also \naligned  with  Sustainable  Development Goal  No.  7:  Affordable  and  Clean  Energy,  and the \ncountry\u2019s intended nationally determined contribution through its contribution to Vision 2025.17  \n \n12.  The proposed investment program will build on the Power Transmission Enhancement \nInvestment Program approved in 2006.18 Transmission system losses have reduced from 7.6% \n                                                \n11 Government of Pakistan, Finance Division. 2008.

The  transformer  capacity \n(11,000 megavolt-amperes) and transmission lines (500 kilometers [km]) added have reduced \noverloading, removed bottlenecks, and improved compliance with the grid code. Compliance \nwith most undertakings in the framework financing agreement (FFA) and covenants in the loan \nagreements is ongoing. While substantial progress in procurement, project management, and \noutcomes has been made under the Power Transmission Enhancement Investment Program, \nfurther improvements could be achieved.19 Lessons learned have been incorporated in the \ndesign of this MFF. The dedicated project management unit (PMU) has been strengthened, \nproject  readiness  has  been  improved,  and  a  facility  management  consultant  and  capacity \ndevelopment plan have been included to address the issues and associated delays experienced \nduring the previous MFF.20 The long-term engagement has enabled ADB to have consistent and \nconstant policy dialogue as the leading partner in the sector.   \n \n13.  Justification for the multitranche financing facility. The required MFF constituents\u2014\na road map, investment program, strategic context, and policy framework\u2014are in place. The \nMFF modality provides critical mass, and continuity to the NTDC for long-term investment \nplanning, and enables ADB to align financing with project readiness and sector reforms.21  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact will be improved transmission infrastructure and management, and energy \nmarket transparency and efficiency. The outcome will be improved coverage, reliability, and \nquality of the power transmission service in Pakistan. \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The outputs of the investment program will be (i) the rehabilitation, augmentation, and \nexpansion of the high-voltage transmission network; and (ii) strengthening of the operations and \nmanagement of the NTDC and CPPA-G. Tranche 1 will have the same physical output as the \ninvestment  program.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the  construction  of  transmission  lines, \nextension and augmentation of substations, and replacement of protection equipment. The \nnonphysical output of tranche 1 will be the strengthening of the operations and management of \nNTDC. This will be achieved through the preparation of a safety manual, capacity development \nplan, and an action plan to meet the government-mandated quota of 10% employment of \n \nwomen, and implementation of a project management and information system, among others. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n16.  The overall financing need for the government\u2019s investment program is in excess of \n$11.0 billion. The MFF will finance a portion of this investment program worth $1.01 billion. \nTable 1 shows the portion of the investment program to be financed by the MFF. \n \n                                                \n19  ADB. 2015.

The MFF will combine OCR and Special Funds resources, i.e., Asian Development Fund \n(ADF) resources, up to the aggregate MFF amount. The provision of any ADF resources will be \nbalanced by a corresponding reduction in available OCR financing (and vice versa), with the \ntotal financing provided under the MFF not to exceed the aggregate MFF total of $810 million. \nAny ADF allocation will be subject to (i) the availability of ADF resources, (ii) Pakistan\u2019s access \nto such resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s applicable Graduation Policy26 and the requirements of \nADF donors, and (iii) the availability of such resources to Pakistan given ADB\u2019s applicable policy \non performance-based allocation of ADF resources.27 \n                                                \n22 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 The tranches may be adjusted to meet the NTDC\u2019s financing requirements and project readiness requirements. \n24 Resettlement impacts could be increased in future tranches because of the nature of transmission system \ninvestments, e.g., transmission lines. Site selections will try to minimize such impacts. \n25 The loan under tranche 1 will be relent to the NTDC only. \n26 Currently: ADB. 2008.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n24.  The investment component of tranche 1 comprises six subprojects grouped into four key \ncomponents summarized below. Detailed due diligence confirmed the project justification and \nload flow analysis, technical viability, and suitability for application within the NTDC system. \n(i)  Subproject 1 will upgrade and augment three substations (Sahiwal, Lahore South, \nand Rewat) to supply power to the distribution systems, complying with the \nsecurity and reliability criteria indicated in the grid code.  \n(ii)  Subproject 2 will install event and fault recorders and fault locators at strategically \nimportant transmission substations in the southern area of the grid. Modern digital \nprotection relays will replace the existing relays, which are no longer fit for purpose. \nTo ensure the grid system stays intact, under-frequency relays are to be installed. \nThe Dadu 500 kilovolt (kV) substation shunt reactor will be replaced to improve the \nvoltage stability of the surrounding 500 kV system. \n(iii)  Subproject 3 is the Faisalabad West substation phase II expansion, including the \ninstallation of 32 km of 500 kV transmission line, along with the associated 500 kV \nline bay equipment at Faisalabad West, and 84 km of 220 kV transmission line, \nalong with the associated 220 kV line bay equipment at Faisalabad West and \nLalian, to meet the growing demand in the Faisalabad distribution system. \n(iv)  Subproject 4 will install 500 kV transmission lines to disperse power generated \nfrom the Guddu gas-fired power plant to the load centers.31  \n                                                \n31 The equipment for the Guddu transmission line was procured under the Power Transmission Enhancement \nInvestment Program Tranche 4. http://www.adb.org/projects/37192-044/main \n \n ", "8 \n \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n25.  Economic and financial analysis will be carried out separately for each tranche under the \ninvestment program. The main benefits derived from tranche 1 are (i) improved reliability and \navoided unserved energy while ensuring compliance with the grid code, (ii) reduced technical \nlosses from transformers, and (iii) increased flow of power from increased substation capacity. \nThe analyses compare the incremental costs and benefits of with- and without-project scenarios.  \n \n26.  A financial evaluation was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.32 Tranche 1 is financially viable, with a financial \ninternal rate of return of 13.1%, which is greater than the weighted average cost of capital of \n7.8%.33 Sensitivity analysis found that the project\u2019s financial viability remained robust in the \ncases of (i) a 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 10% increase in operation and maintenance \ncosts, (iii) a 10% decrease in revenues, and (iv) a 1-year delay in completion. \n   \n27.  The economic evaluation was completed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.34 The economic internal rate of return of 18.6% justifies the \nviability of tranche 1. Sensitivity analysis found that the project\u2019s economic viability remained \nrobust in the cases of (i) a 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 10% decrease in benefits, and \n(iii) a 1-year delay in completion. The results compared favorably with the economic opportunity \ncost of capital of 12% in all cases. \n \n28.  The  NTDC\u2019s  financial  performance  was  assessed  for  tranche  1.  Its  operating \nperformance improved from PRs6 billion in profit before tax in 2012 to PRs9 billion in 2015. Its \nliquidity is also improving, since the central power purchasing agency division\u2019s activities, which \nheld large outstanding receivable from distribution companies, were transferred to the CPPA-G \nin May 2015. As a regulated entity, with a regulated rate of return on equity of 13.11%, the \nNTDC\u2019s financial operation is expected to remain stable throughout the proposed MFF.  \n \nC.  Governance \n29.  The financial management assessment for tranche 1 was conducted in April 2016 and \nthe pre-mitigation risks are substantial. An action plan was agreed to assist the NTDC to \nstrengthen its financial management.35 Although the NTDC has significant experience with ADB \nprojects  and the  Procurement Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended from  time  to time),  capacity \ndevelopment and support are required to prevent the delays experienced in previous projects. \nThis will be provided through a strengthened, dedicated PMU, facility management consultant, \nand capacity development support. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NTDC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the FAM (footnote 22). \n \n                                                \n32 ADB. 2005.

Poverty and Social  \n31.  The investment program will deliver substantial economic and social benefits through \nimproved and more reliable electricity supply. Poor and vulnerable consumers, who make up \nabout half of the population, will particularly benefit as they are often the most affected by \ninadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality. The rural poor, especially the \nwomen who comprise 74% of agricultural workers, will benefit from reduced power outages as it \nwill  improve  crop  water  distribution.  Hospitals and  schools  will  improve  their  services  with \nreduced power outages. Increases in the Human Development Index are strongly correlated \nwith access to reliable electricity supplies.36  \n \n32.  Women will benefit from the use of time-saving electrical appliances, which will cut the \ntime they spend on household chores. Specific benefits will include an action plan for the NTDC \nto meet the government\u2019s 10% quota of employed women. Women will also be targeted in the \nenergy  conservation  and  safety  awareness-raising  activities,  which  will  coincide  with  the \ncommunity awareness campaign on the project.   \n \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  According to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), tranche 1 has been categorized \nB for environment. Civil works in tranche 1 will be limited to the substations and the final \nalignment of the transmission lines. Environmental impacts will be limited to the construction \nphase of these projects. The proposed alignments do not traverse any environmentally sensitive \nareas.  Separate  initial  environmental  examination  studies  have  been  performed  for  the \ncomponents and disclosed on the ADB website.37 The project has been rated a medium risk to \nclimate change. A climate change assessment will be undertaken for each tranche to ensure \nthat appropriate risk mitigating measures are incorporated into the project design. \n \n34.  No physical displacement of persons from housing or loss of more than 10% of income-\ngenerating resources will occur. Project areas have no indigenous peoples. Environment, land \nacquisition, and resettlement impacts are assessed as insignificant. Tranche 1 is classified B for \nenvironment, B for involuntary resettlement, and C for indigenous peoples.38 An environment \nand social impacts cell staffed with environment, social, and resettlement officials has been \nestablished  in  the  PMU.  Capacity  will  be  strengthened  through  the  facility  management \nconsultant until the environment and social impacts cell has sufficient resources. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  The investment program\u2019s benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4, and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.39   \n \n                                                \n36 United States Agency for International Development. 2007.
