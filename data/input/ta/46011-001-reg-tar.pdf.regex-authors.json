INTRODUCTION \n1.  The approved work program of the Independent Evaluation Department (IED) for 2012\u2013\n20141 is driven by the (i) need to keep abreast of emerging regional development issues to \ninform  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  operations  and  development  policy  in  developing \nmember countries (DMCs), (ii) imperatives of ADB\u2019s Strategy 20202 and the Asian Development \nFund (ADF X and XI), and (iii) need to meet client expectations about IED as revealed in last \nyear\u2019s perception survey carried out by ADB Management.3  \n \n2.  Since  1997,  nineteen  \u201cumbrella\u201d  or  facility-type  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects \nadministered by IED have supported similar yearly programs of high level evaluations that \ninvolve multiple countries, sectors, and themes.4 These have been instrumental in providing \ntimely  and  responsive  financing  for  IED  knowledge  products  and  services  that  effectively \ndiscuss emergent operations, and strategy and policy issues. An umbrella TA approved last \nyear is now financing most of the 2012 evaluation studies of the work program for 2012\u20132014.5 \nThe two-phase research and development TA for 2012 will support a further round of evaluation \nstudies from this program cycle.6 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB continuously works to improve the development effectiveness of its operations and \nbe accountable to its stakeholders. It is but a small player in a changing Asia and Pacific region, \nwhere regional performance has been marked by growing populations and increasing economic \nproductivity, and crises of natural and other origins. Past global economic and financial crises \nhad dampening effects on Asian economies and similar crises may recur in the future. The \neffects of poverty, natural disasters, environmental degradation, health hazards, and poor public \nsector management constrain economic growth while market constraints and underinvestment \nin people and assets restrict its inclusiveness. \n \n4.  The new results framework laid out under Strategy 2020 has enabled ADB to monitor its \ndevelopmental role and improve business performance. Taking into account the constraints to \nAsian development, the findings, lessons, and recommendations from evaluations funded under \nthis TA will provide feedback and learning \u2014 particularly when formulating ADB's future policies, \nstrategies, and programs. \n \n5.  Under the guidance of its new leadership team, IED has initiated significant changes in \nits work program and internal processes so as to strengthen the department and make it more \nrelevant, responsive, and influential to ADB work (e.g., enhancing accountability and learning). \nThe  work  program  for  2012\u20132014  puts  emphasis  on  high-impact  evaluations.  High  level \nevaluations are being selected for their strong potential impact on ADB policies and operations \n(and also on DMCs). Since each high level evaluation is a product in its own right, it demands a \nmore rigorous set of evaluation questions, more use of complementary and external expertise, \nmore teamwork within IED across divisions, more in-country consultations, and more elaborate \n                                                 \n1 The 2012\u22122014 work program was discussed and endorsed by the Development Effectiveness Committee on 29 \nSeptember  2011  and  approved  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  on  7  December  2011. \nhttp://www.adb.org/site/evaluation/ied/work-program \n2  ADB. 2008.

This desired move toward greater quality, reach, and impact has budgetary \nimplications, i.e., fewer numbers but more in-depth evaluations. \n \n6.  High level evaluations for financing by this TA will take on areas of special interest to \nADB, including development results from its country and regional partnership strategies and \noperations business plans. Possible topics for sector, theme, and corporate evaluations are (i) \ninstitutional  effectiveness  and  instruments  of  ADB,  such  as  its  decentralization  model;  (ii) \npromotion of inclusive growth; (iii) promotion of good governance; (iv) trade finance; (v) road \nimpact evaluation, and (vi) environment and climate change.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be greater development effectiveness of ADB operations, \npolicies, strategies, and business processes. Its expected outcome will be stronger use of \nevaluation findings, lessons, and recommendations by the ADB Board of Directors, in particular \nthe Development Effectiveness Committee (DEC), and ADB Management. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The evaluation process begins with the preparation of a concept paper by the concerned \nevaluation team. After approval of the concept note by the Director General of IED (DG, IED) an \nevaluation approach paper (EAP) is drafted to describe the intended study (including consultant \nterms of reference and budget).7 All major IED evaluations are targeting inputs to various \nmilestone decision points of ADB Board and Management, and IED will schedule the studies in \ntime to meet tight deadlines on its output targets.8 Completed major evaluation reports will be \ncirculated and discussed by the DEC. \n \n9.  Country evaluations, sector assessments, and validations of country partnership \nstrategy final reviews. IED has agreed with ADB Management that it will trigger evaluation \nstudies in direct response to certain ADB country operations (i.e., IED\u2019s derived program). This \nincludes the preparation of country assistance program evaluations (CAPEs) or validations of \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS) final reviews for select DMCs, provided the CPS into which \nthese feed is announced to IED in time.9 The TA will finance at least one CAPE and the \nvalidation of one CPS final review. Both will be part of IED commitments in the work program for \n2012\u22122014. Each CAPE will evaluate ADB support to the country and cover ADB strategy, \npolicy  dialogue,  completed  and  ongoing  projects  and  technical  assistance,  and  ADB \nperformance. It will provide ADB and the DMC with a basis for determining the future CPS. \nWhen  appropriate,  sector  assessments  will  be  undertaken  to  provide  inputs  during  the \npreparation of each CAPE. Each sector assessment will evaluate ADB performance within a \ngiven sector in the country, focusing again on strategy, policy dialogue, ongoing and completed \nprojects and technical assistance, and performance. \n \n                                                 \n7 The draft EAP is being reviewed by peers and discussed in an IED-wide meeting chaired by DG, IED. The final \nversion takes into account comments on all aspects of the evaluation approach. \n8 Consultant recruitment may start when DG, IED approves the EAP for circulation for interdepartmental comments. \nIED has introduced formal interdepartmental consultation before final approval of an EAP by DG, IED. IED will \nconsider comments from ADB to the extent possible and, if necessary, make changes to the EAP and publish this \nin its website. http://www.adb.org/site/evaluation/ongoing-evaluations \n9  A CAPE is done before preparing a CPS, but not all CPSs are preceded by CAPEs. If the work program of IED \ndoes not include a CAPE for a country that is due for a new CPS, IED will validate a CPS final review. The CPS \nfinal review validation report then serves as the equivalent of a CAPE for the purpose of CPS preparation. ", "3 \n10.  Regional  evaluation.10  The  regional  cooperation  assistance  program  evaluation \n(RCAPE) will assess the development effectiveness of ADB\u2019s strategy and support for the 14 \nPacific  DMCs,  including  a  focused  evaluation  of  progress  under  the  ongoing  ADB  Pacific \nApproach, 2010\u20132014. As appropriate, sector assessments will be undertaken to provide inputs \nfor the preparation of the RCAPE.11 The RCAPE will also draw on recent IED evaluations and \nstudies covering the Pacific DMCs (e.g., transport sector, public sector reforms, governance). Its \nfindings will contribute to the process of making strategic choices and setting priorities for the \nnext Pacific strategy and future operations in Pacific DMCs. \n \n11.  Sector, thematic, and corporate evaluations. The TA will finance at least one special \nevaluation study or evaluation knowledge brief as part of IED\u2019s deliverables in the work program \nfor  2012\u22122013.12  Candidate  topic(s)  for  financing  will  involve  high  level  evaluations  to  be \nselected for their potential benefits to ADB policies and operations (and to DMCs) and as \ndefined in the work program for  2012\u22122014. These range from evaluations of institutional \neffectiveness and instruments of ADB, to reports with a sector or theme focus (para. 6). \n \n12.  Based on present requirements, priority consideration will be given to a study on ADB\u2019s \ndecentralization model.13 The special evaluation study (SES) aims to assess progress made and \nchallenges in ADB decentralization, and to draw on lessons and provide recommendations for \nstrengthening and improving on-going decentralization process.14 This will include a review of \nthe current status and supporting measures of ADB decentralization of decision making from its \nhead office to resident missions regarding the transformation of administrative and financing \nauthority in resource management and project preparation and implementation. \n \n13.  Dissemination of knowledge publications. To make its evaluation products more \naccessible  and  influential,  IED  continues  to  disclose,  disseminate,  and  share  evaluation \nfeedback on performance and lessons (para. 5). Using evaluation study results, it will prepare \nand publish syntheses, briefs, and occasional papers tailored to widen readership and provide \ncontinuous feedback on ADB\u2019s operations, strategies, and policies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n10 The timing for the evaluation of the Pacific Approach will be discussed in the second quarter of 2013 subsequent to \na midterm review by the Pacific Department. \n11 Sector activities for assessment will consider ADB priorities in the Pacific (including maturity and size of the \nprogram on which to base a sector assessment) and be discussed with ADB\u2019s Pacific Department as appropriate. \n(see footnote 3 of Appendix 3). \n12 Special evaluation studies will include evaluations of policies and strategies, and corporate functions. The \nassessments will (i) cover different modalities, sectors, or countries; and (ii) extract and aggregate data and \ninformation on specific themes. Evaluation briefs will offer insights and lessons on current issues as well as \nselected ADB projects and programs. \n13 The study is one of four IED evaluations for action under ADB\u2019s ADF XI implementation plan. The evaluation on \nADB\u2019s decentralization model, with particular consideration of its business model for working in low-capacity \ncountries, is tentatively scheduled for completion in the first half of 2013.  \n14 In line with its Strategy 2020, ADB has undertaken organizational arrangements that support country ownership \nwith its professional and capital resources, to overcome internal weaknesses and effectively meet the diverse \nneeds of clients. Within the ADB, departments are given more flexibility to make best use of their resources. Other \nmajor changes include further decentralization of decision making to resident missions, to reduce documentation \nrequirements for lower transaction costs of project preparation and implementation. ", "4 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. IED will implement it and supervise all \nplanned studies. The studies will require the services of 11 international consultants for about \n22 person-months and 19 national consultants for about 29 person-months.15 The outline terms \nof reference for consulting requirements are in Appendix 3. More detailed terms of reference for \neach study will be developed in the EAP. ADB will engage consultants primarily on an individual \nbasis in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time \nto time). Specific requirements for services of consulting firms (e.g., surveys) will be considered \nduring preparation of the EAP. \n \n16.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Tracking of study \nprogress will be recorded through internal monitoring sheets on key milestone events, mission \nback-to-office reports, and ad-hoc presentations or consultations on evaluation study findings. \nThe TA outputs will be disseminated in accordance with IED\u2019s evaluation policy, particularly with \nregard to public disclosure, dissemination, and lessons. The TA is scheduled to start on 15 \nAugust 2012 and expected to end by 31 August 2014. Implementation arrangements will be \nflexible to accommodate alterations in IED\u2019s work program or changes in response to priorities \nunder Strategy 2020 and ADF assistance (ADF X and XI). ADB will obtain a no-objection from \nthe DMC government before starting any activity financed under this TA in the territory of that \ncountry. \nIV.  DECISION \n17.  The Director General, Independent Evaluation Department, acting under the authority \ndelegated by the Board, has approved the provision of technical assistance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for Selected Evaluation Studies for 2012, Phase 1. This \naction is hereby reported to the Board. \n                                                 \n15 The number of consultants and their inputs are tentative. Consultant requirements will be reviewed during the \nconcept paper phase and finalized in the EAP (para. 8).

Derived Program from Country Operations1 \n1.  Country assistance program evaluations, sector assessments, and validations of \ncountry partnership strategy final reviews (three international consultants for a total of 6 \nperson-months and seven national consultants for 10.5 person-months). Country assistance \nevaluations provide the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the developing member countries \n(DMC) with a basis for determining the future country partnership strategy (CPS).2 Depending \non country and sector requirements, sector and/or thematic assessments are undertaken to \nprovide inputs to the main country assistance program evaluation (CAPE). Sector assessments \nwill evaluate ADB's strategy, policy dialogue, ongoing and completed projects and technical \nassistance, and performance within a given sector in a country. Their preparation will require the \nservices of sector and/or theme specialists (both international and national). \n2.  The international consultants (total of 4 person-months for a CAPE or validation of a \nCPS final review, and 2 person-months for sector assessments) are expected to (i) update \nreviews  of  ADB-financed  assistance  programs  and  assess  their  relevance,  effectiveness, \nefficiency, sustainability, and their impacts on strategic sector objectives; (ii) undertake key \ninformant interviews and conduct stakeholder surveys on the outcome and impact of ADB \nassistance, and discuss sector development issues and concerns with executing agencies and \nother government and nongovernment entities, as appropriate; and (iii) help assess the validity \nof ADB\u2019s sector development strategies in the study country. \n3.  With attention to country and sector requirements, national evaluation consultants (total \nof 4 person-months for two headquarters-based consultants and 6.5 person-months for five in-\ncountry experts) with previous exposure to sector development issues in the study country will \nbe recruited to (i) present an overview of the relevance and implementation of ADB sector \nstrategies; (ii) assess and rate the achievement of project and program objectives, and the \ndelivery  of  core  sector  and  crosscutting  and  thematic  programs;  (iii)  comment  on  ADB\u2019s \ninstitutional positioning and performance in a sector; (iv) organize and facilitate focus group \ndiscussions, workshops, and meetings; and (v) define important issues and lessons in a sector\u2019s \noperations. \n4.  Regional cooperation assistance program evaluation (four international consultants \nfor a total of 8 person-months and six national consultants for 9 person-months). The regional \ncooperation  assistance  program  evaluation  (RCAPE)  will  evaluate  ADB  performance  in \nsupporting its Pacific DMCs in relation to the objectives and strategy of ADB's Pacific Approach, \n2010\u20132014. Its findings will inform the next Pacific strategy and future operations in the 14 \ncountries. The evaluation will require the services of a consultant team as follows: \n5.  Program evaluation specialists. The international consultants (two consultants for a \ntotal of 4 person-months) will act as team leader and co-leader of the consultant team. Both will \nhave  experience  in  undertaking  country  program  evaluations,  regional  strategic  planning, \nmacro\u2013microeconomic  analysis,  cross-country  and  cross-sector  development  and  project \nanalysis, and (preferably) have strong familiarity with and experience in the Pacific region. \n                                                 \n1  Estimates of consultant requirements are tentative and will be reviewed during discussions on the concept paper \nand in finalizing the evaluation approach paper (main text, para. 8). \n2  A country assistance program evaluation (CAPE) is done before preparing a CPS, but not all CPSs are preceded \nby CAPEs. If the work program of the Independent Evaluation Department (IED) does not include a CAPE for a \ncountry that is due for a new CPS, IED will validate a CPS final review.
