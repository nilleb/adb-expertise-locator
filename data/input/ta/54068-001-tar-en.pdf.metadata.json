INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA), Support to Climate  Resilient \nInvestment Pathways in the Pacific, will support the efforts of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nin scaling up its investment in climate change adaptation in all 14 Pacific developing member \ncountries (DMCs).1 It will do so by building on past and ongoing ADB efforts in the Pacific. These \nefforts include climate-proofing infrastructure investments; supporting the development of small-\nvalue renewable energy projects for mitigating emissions; designing water sector adaptation \ninvestments; facilitating greater flows of climate finance into the region; providing a range of \nfinancial  products  for  disaster  and  emergency assistance, from  initial  disaster  response to \nrecovery and reconstruction; and supporting policy and capacity development interventions to \nreduce climate change and disaster risks.2 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the regional operations business plan for the Pacific, 2020\u20132022.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  A recent review of ADB\u2019s current climate risk assessment system identified a need to shift \nADB support further upstream to enable a more strategic analysis of climate risks and climate \nprogramming at the country, thematic, and sector levels.4 To date, the system has primarily \nfocused on project-specific support, which is still necessary but needs to take on a more holistic \napproach to better help the DMCs respond to growing climate threats.  \n \n4.  ADB and its Pacific DMCs need an upstream and multifaceted approach for several \nreasons, including \n \n(i)  the multitude of climate change threats facing Pacific countries, including rising \nsea levels and associated coastal inundation and erosion, more intense cyclones \nand extreme rainfall events, longer droughts, and weakened marine ecosystems \nfrom bleaching and acidification;5  \n(ii)  the  immediacy  of  the  risks,  including  the  lack  of  fresh  water  in  low-lying \ncommunities, with sea incursions polluting once-reliable water sources;  \n(iii)  recent evidence suggesting that sea level rise is accelerating faster than previous \nprojections, because of rapid melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets;6   \n(iv)  the multifaceted impacts of climate change, including economic and financial \nimpacts (sovereign credit profiles are already being influenced by climate extremes, \nand markets are starting to price-in future climate change);  \n \n1  The Pacific DMCs are the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, \nNiue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. TA activities in DMCs will \nbe initiated only after a no-objection letter has been obtained from the government. \n2   ADB. 2005. Pacific Studies Series, Climate Proofing, A Risk-based Approach to Adaptation. Manila. Climate proofing \nis a shorthand term for identifying risks to a development project as a consequence of climate variability and change, \nand ensuring that those risks are reduced to acceptable levels through long-lasting and environmentally sound, \neconomically viable, and socially acceptable changes implemented at one or more of the following stages in the \nproject cycle: planning, design, construction, operation, and decommissioning. \n3   ADB. 2019.

The Pacific DMCs are scaling up infrastructure investments, which adds urgency to \nbroadening ADB\u2019s approach. It is vital that these investments steer the Pacific towards greater \nresilience. A new approach to project design and development in the Pacific will reflect ADB\u2019s \noverall commitment to provide $80 billion from 2019 to 2030 to combat climate change. \n \n6.  The TA\u2019s strategic, multifaceted, and risk-informed approach will support country and \nregional  commitments  to  climate  change  adaptation  measures,  while  integrating  into  the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) economic recovery efforts.7 This approach will also align with \nStrategy 2030.8 In particular, it will help advance the four Strategy 2030 components under ADB\u2019s \noperational priority three (Table 1). To varying degrees, it will also support resilience (the third \nStrategy 2030 component), cutting across the other six operational priorities (Table 2).  \n \nTable 1: Alignment to Strategy 2030\u2019s Components and Operational Priorities \nStrategy 2030  Strategy 2030 Components \nOperational Priority 3  Prosperity  Inclusion  Resilience  Sustainability \nTackle climate change,  Invest in natural  Reduce  Integrate social,  Optimize multiple \nbuild climate and disaster  capital and low  vulnerability of  ecological, financial,  benefits in the context \nresilience, and enhance  carbon, resilient  poor people and  and physical  of the Sustainable \nenvironmental  development  communities  aspects  Development Goals \nsustainability  (SDGs), particularly \nSDG 13 \nSource: ADB. 2019.

In addition, the TA will advance the draft Pacific Approach 2021\u20132025, support the Asian \nDevelopment Fund\u2019s focus on small island developing states and its thematic priorities that \ninclude climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, and aid ADB\u2019S alignment with the \nParis Agreement in accordance with the methodology currently under development.9 \n \n8.  The TA will also apply lessons learned from previous ADB projects that helped build \nclimate resilience in the Pacific.10 These lessons include: \n \n(i)  Opportunities exist to reduce future risk from sea level rise and extreme events, \nbut action must be taken now to build adaptation and resilience into planning \nprocesses. \n(ii)  A greater understanding of the barriers to long-term adaptation is needed if holistic \nand strategic responses to climate change are to be defined and planned. \n(iii)  Climate change adaptation must be better mainstreamed into national and sector \ndevelopment planning to ensure that adaptation interventions are not developed \nand implemented as stand-alone projects. \n(iv)  Climate change and disaster risk assessment further upstream (e.g., as part of \ncountry programming) can help inform the type and location of future investments. \n(v)  Geospatial climate and disaster risk information can greatly improve this upstream \nassessment, thereby strengthening risk-based decision-making. \n(vi)  More consistent efforts are required to build the capacity of government agencies \nin climate change adaptation (e.g., augmenting capacity through consultants on a \nper project basis has had a limited impact). \n \n9.  Finally, the TA will build on approaches developed and implemented by the Adaptation \nand Land Use Working Group, ADB\u2019s working group on geographic information system (GIS), \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Thematic Group, Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange  Department,  Private  Sector  Operations  Department,  and  ADB\u2019s  other  regional \ndepartments. These approaches include the lessons from the Sustainable Development and \nClimate  Change  Department\u2019s  Pilot  Program  for  Climate  Resilience,  which  established \nprogrammatic approaches to climate change adaptation and resilience-building, in particular the \ndevelopment of robust pipelines of investments.11 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: resilience to climate change impacts and \nassociated  risks  in  Pacific  DMCs  improved  across  built  infrastructure,  ecosystems  and \ncommunities.12 The TA will have the following outcome: systemic resilient adaptation pathways in \nthe Pacific increased.  \n \n9  Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 12 December 2015.

Manila. \n ", "4 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Access to climate change information improved for strategic decision-\nmaking. Accurate, timely, and relevant information saves decision-makers both time and money \nthrough  increased  efficiency,  improved  productivity,  and  rapid  deployment  of  innovations. \nFor instance, multi-hazard assessments that model future climate change impacts can help inform \nstrategic decision-making to support long-term adaptation, such as steering population and asset \ngrowth away from exposed areas. Under this output, ADB will pursue two strategies, as follows. \n \n12.  The first strategy is to analyze key barriers to long-term adaptation. ADB will seek to \nidentify the full range of economic, political, social, and governance barriers in its Pacific DMCs, \nas well as benefits and opportunities that adaptation would bring to Pacific DMCs. To optimize \nsynergies, this  analysis  can  be  conducted  in conjunction  with  assessments  by the  Pacific \nDepartment (PARD) for fragile and conflict-affected situations. From this analysis, ADB will help \nPacific DMCs better define and justify differentiated measures to address the physical, economic, \nand financial risks of climate change (under output 2 below).  \n \n13.  The second strategy is to expand access to data on climate change and disaster risks. In \ncoordination with other development partners working across the region, the Pacific Regional \nInfrastructure  Facility,13 and  ongoing  work  under  the  Pacific  Disaster  Resilience  Program \n(footnote 10), ADB will explore options for a consistent regional approach and tool to collect, \nanalyze, and store geospatial climate and disaster risk information, including information on the \nexposure and vulnerability of infrastructure and development assets. The ultimate goal of this \nstrategy is to help Pacific DMCs evaluate and use such information to develop investments that \nsupport both long-term adaptation to climate change and community resilience to natural hazards. \nSpecific interventions will be determined through consultations and close collaboration with the \nADB GIS Working Group, the Urban Climate Change and Resilient Trust Fund Spatial Data \nAnalysis Explorer, and regional partners.14 The TA will prioritize support for climate modeling and \nmulti-hazard disaster risk assessment studies in conjunction with PARD management and Pacific \nDMC governments.  \n \n14.  Output 2: Planning and policy development processes enhanced to better adapt to \na changing climate. Building on the two strategies employed under output 1, this output will help \nPacific DMCs pursue a portfolio of strategic resilience measures to address rising climate risks, \nwith complementary approaches to address financial and economic risks. The three strategies to \nachieve output 2 will be implemented with the recognition that there is no single approach to \nclimate change adaptation in the Pacific. Additionally, these strategies will work in synergy with \nADB\u2019s Pacific Disaster Resilience Program and associated TA.15  \n \n \n13  ADB.  Pacific  Region  Infrastructure  Facility  Coordination  Office-Leveraging  Infrastructure  for  Sustainable \nDevelopment.  \n14 Regional partners include Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Commonwealth Scientific and \nIndustrial Research Organisation, Japan\u2019s Asia Pacific Adaptation Information Platform, New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of \nForeign Affairs and Trade, the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Company, the Pacific Community, the Pacific \nRegional Environment Programme, and World Bank. \n15 In ten participating Pacific countries, the program provides contingent financing (in the form of loans and grants) \nassociated with short-term, post-disaster, and early recovery financing needs, while the associated TA supports \npriority long-term disaster risk management activities to strengthen the resilience of institutions and communities. \n ", "5 \n15.  The third strategy is to formulate adaptation pathways to increase long-term resilience.16 \nADB will help DMCs pursue an iterative adaptation pathways approach to address the root causes \nof exposure and vulnerability to climate change.17 Because of the uncertainty of projections, this \ninvolves planning a range of immediate, medium, and long-term adaptation strategies across \nmultiple sectors, with a cycle of review and updates.18 If done holistically, such an approach can \nprovide a strong economic justification for sound long-term investments by considering factors \nsuch as sovereign creditworthiness, stranded assets, and cascading impacts. In addition, working \nin collaboration with PARD\u2019s sector divisions, the TA should ensure that investments do not lock \neconomies into maladaptive pathways that are difficult and costly to change later.  \n  \n16.  The fourth strategy is to develop capital investment plans for resilient infrastructure and \nservices. Following the programmatic approach implemented under the Pilot Program for Climate \nResilience (footnote 11), the adaptation strategies developed under the third strategy will be used \nto  help  develop  integrated  multisectoral  capital  investment  plans  to  inform  ADB  country \nprogramming. The plans will identify high-priority \u201ctype 2\u201d green and gray investments and can \nalso screen out investment projects that do not contribute to resilience.19 Developing these plans \nwill  involve  multistakeholder  engagement  processes,  including  community  level  adaptation \nactions.20 In these efforts, ADB will seek to leverage increased levels of external climate finance, \ncontinuing efforts to access climate finance from bilateral and multilateral sources, such as the \nGreen Climate Fund.   \n \n17.  The fifth strategy is to support policy development and capacity building at the national \nlevel. ADB will promote mainstreaming climate change  adaptation into national and sector \ndevelopment planning by integrating climate change adaptation strategies into current policy, \nplanning, and development efforts, rather than addressing it through stand-alone projects or \nprograms. ADB will engage with ministries in charge of finance and economic planning, together \nwith climate change, environment, and sector ministries to (i) leverage efforts associated with \nexisting development budgets, (ii) address identified barriers to long-term adaptation, and (iii) shift \nnational plans and financial management to align with an adaptation pathways approach. ADB \nwill strengthen links with the nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans \nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreements.21  \n \n \n16 M. Haasnoot et al. 2013. Dynamic adaptive policy pathways: A method for crafting robust decisions for a deeply \nuncertain world. Global Environmental Change. Volume 23 (issue no. 2). pages 485-498. \n17  This approach is consistent with climate risk informed decision analysis, which is applied in the water sector and \npromoted by the Alliance for Global Water Adaptation. \n18 Whenever possible, these strategies will align with ADB\u2019s efforts to promote low-carbon growth in its Pacific DMCs, \nparticularly in the areas of transport, urban development, and clean energy. Clean energy includes ongoing ADB \nsupport to develop small-value renewable energy projects in the Pacific, which increases resilience by reducing \ndependence on imported diesel-fueled electricity generation. Since adaptation solutions are site-dependent, local \nplanning  decisions  must  be  tailored  to  local  conditions,  with  three  main  strategies  available\u2014protecting, \naccommodating, and retreating. Measures can start with no- and low-regret options, which have favorable benefit-\nto-cost ratios, and investments can then be sequenced over time. Decision makers can use \u201ctrigger points\u201d (e.g., sea \nlevel rise above a certain point) to account for uncertainty in projections. \n19  The main objective of type 2 adaptation activities is to address climate change risks. This contrasts with type 1 \nadaptation, which consists of incremental measures to \u201cclimate proof\u201d infrastructure. Gray investments can either \nsupport the construction of new assets or the rehabilitation of existing assets. Green investments could include \nrestoring forests, mangroves, and wetlands. \n20  Building from COVID-19 response, social protection measures could include improved community preparedness for \nclimate change and extreme weather events. \n21  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is an international environmental treaty addressing \nclimate change, negotiated and signed by 154 states at the United Nations Conference on Environment and \nDevelopment, informally known as the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June 1992. \n ", "6 \n18.  Output 3: Projects and programs supported, with focus on upstream inputs and \npartnership building. ADB will strive to improve its support to projects and programs in the \nPacific. Whether through project-level assessments or regional partnerships, the goal of this \noutput is to promote climate resilient approaches throughout the region.  \n \n19.  The sixth strategy is to integrate climate and disaster risks into project designs. At the \nproject level, ADB will continue to refine its approach to climate risk and adaptation assessments. \nRisk assessments should be integrated from the start of project conceptualization, based on the \nlatest scientific findings and projections. The TA will provide support to integrate quality climate \nand disaster risk assessment and emissions reduction analysis into project preparation processes, \nespecially for projects that receive grant financing under the Asian Development Fund 13 thematic \npool on climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction. It will also conduct assessments on the \nParis  Alignment.22 Downstream  implementation  of  climate  risk  management  will  also  be \nstrengthened by enabling more flexible and iterative adaptation and risk reduction interventions \nand improving mechanisms for monitoring, evaluation and learning.  \n \n20.  The seventh strategy is to strengthen regional capacity through knowledge sharing, \npartnerships, and policy dialogue. ADB will seek to strengthen the knowledge, skills, and practices \nof government agencies that have responsibility for climate change and disaster risk management. \nIn these efforts, ADB will look to develop and strengthen regional networks, policy dialogues and \npeer-to-peer learning, in partnership with regional organizations, development partners, civil \nsociety, and private sector organizations. A focus will be on promoting gender-transformative \napproaches, which directly seek to change conditions and practices that perpetuate gender \ninequalities and relations of power between men or women.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.0 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $1.0 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Climate Change Fund. The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. The TA activities outlined in paras. 12\u201320 are eligible for Climate Change Fund \nfinancing according to para. 16 of its implementation guidelines revised in August 2020.23 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  ADB, through PARD\u2019s Energy Division, will be the executing agency and will exercise \noverall responsibility for coordination, supervision, and implementation of all TA activities, while \nthe Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will provide technical support. \nThe TA will be monitored principally through biannual progress reports. \n \n23.  The Energy Division will supervise and oversee recruitment of an international consulting \nfirm and individual consultants. A firm will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod with a 90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio through simplified technical proposal. Three climate \nchange and disaster risk management specialists (two international and one national), one \ninternational climate change scientist, and one national project coordinator will be recruited \nfollowing ADB\u2019s individual consultant selection. Over its course, the TA may require additional  \ninternational climate change and disaster risk management specialists; experts in the field of \n \n22  Paris Alignment means supporting climate action that is in line with the Paris Agreement through financing, policy \nsupport and capacity development. \n23  ADB. 2020.
