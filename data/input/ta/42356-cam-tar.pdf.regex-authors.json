The Supreme National Economic Council (SNEC) is the highest-level body mandated to \nprovide the Prime Minister of Cambodia with technical analysis, advice, and recommendations \nregarding policies and strategies for the nation\u2019s rapid, sustainable socioeconomic development. \nThe  SNEC  was  established  by  sub-decree  on  28  December  2002,  and  its  management \nstructure comprises senior government officials from the Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(MEF), the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC), and the Rural Development Bank. \nThe SNEC acts as a filter for and de facto coordinator of economic research and policy between \nthe Prime Minister\u2019s office and the various government line ministries and agencies, including in \nthe elaboration of national and sector strategies.1 Following the successful implementation of \ntwo  previous  phases  of  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \ninstitutional support to SNEC,2 the Government requested that ADB provide a third phase to \nfurther  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  SNEC  for  national  policy  analysis  and \ndevelopment  management. 3 A  fact-finding  mission  (13\u201315  August  2008)  reached  an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financial arrangements, and consulting services for the TA.  A design and \nmonitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Although Cambodia has made significant progress over the last decade in rebuilding its \nphysical and social infrastructure and institutions, following the cessation of hostilities inside the \ncountry, and is successfully emerging from its post-conflict situation, the development agenda \nremains daunting. Economic growth in recent years has been high, averaging just over 11% per \nyear between 2004 and 2007. Although poverty has declined, it remains unacceptably high, with \nabout one third of the population living below the poverty line in 2007, including about 40% in \nrural areas. The recent increase in food and oil prices is likely to have increased the number of \npeople  living  below  the  poverty  line.  The  Government  recognizes  this  key  development \nchallenge, and recently announced an updated Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, \nEquity, and Efficiency, Phase II (RS2), which was prepared by SNEC. The Government is also \nabout to complete a midterm review of the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), 2006\u2013\n2010, which was also assessed by SNEC, and has vowed to place renewed emphasis on pro-\npoor  agricultural  and  rural  development,  in  addition  to  extending  reforms  in  the  areas  of \ngovernance, private sector development and employment generation, rehabilitation of physical \ninfrastructure, and capacity building and human resource development. ADB\u2019s midterm review \n                                                 \n1  While the SNEC is not directly institutionally represented at the Council of Ministers, it is one of four supreme \ncouncils that have been established with specific mandates and policy responsibilities that cut across different line \nministries and agencies. Others include the Council for Agricultural and Rural Development, the Council for \nAdministrative Reform, and the Supreme Council of the Magistrature. The senior council management of SNEC \ncomprises an honorary president (minister of economy and finance, with the rank of deputy Prime Minister), an \nhonorary advisor (currently Cambodia\u2019s ambassador to the World Trade Organization and a former country director \nof ADB Cambodia Resident Mission, a chairperson (secretary of state, MEF), two vice-chairs, of which one is \npermanent, a secretary general, and two permanent deputy secretary generals. The remaining secretariat staff \ncomprises 40 researchers in three units (economic policy, social policy, and governance), five administrative \nsupport staff, and five fellows and associates. \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance Completion Report for Institutional Support for National Economic Policy \nManagement in Cambodia. Manila (TA 3721-CAM); ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia \nfor Capacity Building for National Economic Policy Analysis and Development Management. Manila (TA 4600). The \nclosing date of the latter was extended three times; from 30 May to 31 December 2007, then to 30 April 2008 \n(including a minor change in scope), and finally, to 31 May 2008. The TA completion report is being prepared. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 September 2008. \n ", "2                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                       \n   \nof  the  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP),  conducted  in  mid-2007,4 is  aligned  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  program,  including  the  renewed  emphasis  on  agricultural  and  rural \ndevelopment. How successful the Government is in meeting this key development challenge will \ndepend in large part on further improving the capacity of Government to effectively formulate, \ncoordinate, implement, and monitor key strategies, policies, and legislation to enhance the \ndepth, coverage, speed, and sustainability of the reform program. As the Prime Minister\u2019s \neconomic and social policy think tank and provider of objective and rigorous policy advice at the \nnational  and  subregional  levels,  the  SNEC  is  central  to  the  formulation,  coordination,  and \nmonitoring of this process.  \n \n3.  The first and second phases of the TA were aimed at accelerating and improving the \nquality and sustainability of the economic reform process in Cambodia by helping to improve the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity, through the SNEC, to formulate and monitor the implementation of \nnational economic policies, including with respect to regional integration.5 The recent adoption \nof RS2 provides a framework for the Government\u2019s socioeconomic policies and programs, \nincluding those related to regional integration.  \n \n4.  With respect to the regional dimension of the Government\u2019s national reform agenda, the \nsecond phase TA also supported the preparation of policy documents and statements6 for high-\nlevel official meetings and summits, including those related to the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), and Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-\nMekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS); and high-level conferences, including the \nDavos Forum and the Cambodia Economic Forum.  \n \n5.  Support provided under the first two phases of ADB TA have (i) helped establish solid \nfoundations for the SNEC to carry out strategic and policy analysis; (ii) been instrumental in the \ndevelopment of core expertise in SNEC in some key areas of macroeconomic and sector \nanalysis; (iii) contributed to improving the analytical and writing ability of a core team of SNEC \nstaff; and (iv) helped disseminate the studies to the wider public by financing the publication of \nsome key reports. The proposed third phase of TA support to the SNEC seeks to build on this \nmore general capacity building by providing targeted assistance that helps SNEC demonstrate \nits operational effectiveness. Specifically, the third phase would support the preparation of high-\nquality and priority analyses and studies as necessary inputs into revised or new economic and \nsocial development policies that are being prepared for consideration by the Government. In \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2007. Midterm Review of the Country Strategy and Program: Cambodia (2005\u20132009). Manila.  \n5  The first phase of the TA provided quality, timely inputs to the Prime Minister on a diverse range of issues on a \nneeds  basis.  The  second  phase  of  TA  supported  a  more  defined  policy  agenda,  including:  (i)  studies  of \nmacroeconomic developments, including a fiscal revenue policy review and an analysis of the determinants of the \nrecent spike in inflation; (ii) an agriculture sector review covering crops, fisheries, and forestry; (iii) an infrastructure \nreview, covering energy, roads, and irrigation; and (iv) a fiscal analysis of the budget, the public investment \nprogram and the medium-term expenditure framework. Given the Government\u2019s emphasis on rural development \nfor sustainable growth and poverty reduction, the TA also supported the preparation of a study on enhancing rural \nincomes. Finally, the TA also provided advisory support to the review of the implementation of the original \nRectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency 2003\u20132008; although now revised, the \nstrategy remains the cornerstone of the Government\u2019s socioeconomic development strategy and the basis for the \nNSDP 2006\u20132010. \n6  Many of the Phase II-supported analytical studies conducted by SNEC have already been translated into specific \ngovernment policies. For example, (i) the study on the medium-term expenditure framework provided a critical \ninput into the Government\u2019s public financial management reform program in MEF, which is now being rolled out to \nline ministries; (ii) the fiscal policy review, which analyses the country\u2019s tax structure and revenue administration, \nincorporates specific recommendations to improve revenue policy, including with respect to the oil and gas sector; \nand (iii) the analysis of the determinants of the recent spike in inflation provided the analytical basis for a series of \ngovernment policies to counteract rising inflationary pressures. \n ", "   3                          \n             \nparticular, the proposed TA would provide important inputs for shaping the Government\u2019s policy \napproach in the areas of (i) macroeconomics, including fiscal and monetary policies, agricultural \nand  rural  development,  trade  and  investment,  the  labor  market,  land  and  real  estate, \ncompetitiveness, and oil and gas; and (ii) several areas related to regional economic integration, \nincluding  the  GMS  issues  of  cross-border  transport,  trade  and  logistics,  power  sharing, \ntelecommunication,  agricultural  trade,  tourism,  and  labor  migration,  so  as  to  ensure  more \nintegrated linkages between local, national, and subregional policies and programs. \n \n6.  The Government attaches a high priority to strengthening the SNEC and is committed to \ndeveloping it into a first-rate provider of objective economic and social policy advice, and the \nincreased maturity and sustainability of SNEC is already evident. SNEC recently strengthened \nits operational management, including through the appointment of a permanent vice chairperson \nand  two  permanent  deputy  secretary  generals.  As  a  testament  to  its  increasing  ability  to \ncoordinate policy formulation across government ministries, the Government recently agreed to \nmake the SNEC the executing agency for ongoing project preparatory technical assistance for \nthe Tonle Sap Poverty Reduction and Smallholder Development Project being prepared for \n2009.7 The SNEC has also recently drafted an Institutional Development Plan (IDP) 2015, which \nis designed to increase the financial sustainability of SNEC, reduce its need for development \npartner support, and transform SNEC into a first-rate Cambodian think tank.8 The proposed third \nphase of TA would retain the use of an international economic policy advisor to help ensure \nquality  control,  including  over  national  consultant  outputs,  with  emphasis  on  training  an \nexpanded group of core researchers able to balance analytical rigor with the need to provide \nrecommendations that will be implemented. This would be supported by ongoing regionally \nfocused capacity building projects for both middle- and senior-level government officials. \n \n7.  More specifically, the proposed TA complements two other regionally focused capacity \ndevelopment  programs, including (i) ongoing TA for the Phnom Penh Plan for Development \nManagement  Program,  which  supports  development  of  institutional  capacities  and  human \nresource capabilities of middle-to senior-level officials in GMS member countries to improve the \nquality of decision making at the national and subregional levels;9 and (ii) prospective TA for \nPubic Policy Training Program 2007\u20132010,10 which aims to build institutional capacity and public \nadministration  systems  through  clusters  of  training  programs  on  economic  reforms  and \ndevelopment management for civil service officials at middle- to senior-levels in Cambodia \n(including SNEC), Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. Together, these regionally focused capacity building \nprograms will help strengthen SNEC\u2019s understanding and analysis of regional issues, most \nnotably  those  related  to  the  GMS,  and  encourage  useful  networking  with  other  regionally \nfocused think tanks and policy institutes. \n \n8.  In that context, the proposed TA is fully accordance with the midterm review of the 10 \nyear strategic framework of the GMS 2002\u20132012.11 The review emphasized the need for an \nincreased focus on the \u201csoftware\u201d components of cooperation and integration, including the \ndevelopment of human resources through subregional programs such as the Phnom Penh Plan \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Tonle Sap Poverty Reduction and \nSmallholder Development Project. Manila. \n8  The IDP 2015 states that the Government will provide one-third of the overall SNEC budget by 2011 (the end of the \nthird phase of the TA), rising to two-thirds of the budget by 2014. \n9 ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Greater Mekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management \nII. Manila.   \n10  The regional TA covers Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. Implementation began in Viet Nam in September \n2007, and has just started in Cambodia and the Lao PDR. \n11   ADB. 2007. Midterm Review of the Greater Mekong Subregion Strategic Framework (2002\u20132012). Manila.    \n ", "4                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                       \n   \nfor Development Management (para. 7), and closer cooperation on analyzing cross-border \nissues, such as trade and investment linkages, which is included in the SNEC work plan. The \nfocus of the TA is also consistent with the objectives in the joint summit declaration of the Third \nGMS Summit, which highlighted the need to more closely link local, national, and subregional \npolicies and programs to increase regional trade and investment.12 \n \n9.   The proposed TA is also complementary to the ongoing and prospective assistance to \nthe  SNEC  from  other  development  partners,  notably  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme and the World Bank. The United Nations Development Programme is planning to \ncontinue to provide the SNEC with financial and logistical support in preparation for the annual \nCambodia economic forum (next scheduled for January 2009), including by funding consultants \nto undertake research on topics to be presented at the annual economic forums, as well as one \nor two SNEC staff to undertake research on issues that may emerge and are not currently part \nof the core research agenda (e.g., rising inflation, which was not included in SNEC\u2019s original \n2008 work plan). For its part, the World Bank would continue to fund the training of SNEC staff \nthrough the World Bank Institute and its affiliated link to the Korean Development Institute, and \nis considering contributing financial support to help equip SNEC\u2019s planned resource center. \n \n10.  Finally, depending on the success of the third phase to deliver the anticipated outcomes \nand achieving the expected impact, as well as the availability of additional funding, a fourth and \nfinal phase could be envisaged whereby ADB assistance assists in securing more permanent \nsource(s) of funding and establishing SNEC\u2019s reputation as a first-rate Cambodian think tank. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  Building on accomplishments under the earlier TA projects, the third phase of the TA \naims to improve the Government\u2019s ability to effectively formulate, coordinate, implement, and \nmonitor  key  policies  and  strategies  of  its  reform  program  (RS2)  to  promote  sustainable \neconomic development, by enhancing the capacity of SNEC to provide high-quality analysis and \nadvice on economic and social development policies and strategies, including with respect to \nagricultural and rural development and regional economic integration, to key policy makers.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   All the outputs listed above (bottom half of paragraph 5, page 3) are designed to directly \nor indirectly increase the capacity of SNEC to demonstrate its operational effectiveness by \nbuilding the capacity of SNEC to produce and translate high quality analyses into specific \npolicies and strategies for implementation. Thus, the outputs are focused on finalizing the IDP \n2015, deepening the staff\u2019s capacity for high-quality policy-oriented research, and producing \neconomic assessments and analyses and the related policy agenda.  \n \n13.   The key activities of the TA to achieve the outputs are to (i) help finalize the IDP 2015; \n(ii) take stock of the current staff capacity, and identify and implement annual training programs, \nincluding through mentoring, on-the-job training, and provision of specialized training. The latter \nwould include short-term (1\u20132 weeks) training for up to 10 SNEC staff selected on a merit basis \n                                                 \n12 Joint Summit Declaration of the Third GMS Summit. Held in Vientiane, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 30\u201331 \nMarch  2008.  http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2008/3rd-GMS-Summit/GMS-Joint-Summit-Declaration-\n2008.pdf \n ", "   5                          \n             \nin prestigious international institutions such as the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Such \nspecialized training would be in addition to that provided by the regionally focused capacity \ndevelopment programs mentioned above, the Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management, \nand the Public Policy Training Program; (iii) identify core support research and analytical studies \non priority economic and development issues in the SNEC work plan, produce studies, and get \nthem published and disseminated; (iv)  help equip and launch a Resource Center for SNEC to \nenhance access to data and information, including through the provision of IT-related equipment \nto enable networking; and (v) support  the  design  and  launching  of  an  economic  database \nfacility.   \n \n14.   The beneficial impact of the TA is based on two key assumptions. First, that the Prime \nMinister will continue to rely on SNEC to produce high-quality policy-oriented analytical research \nand studies that help determine government-wide policies, and that SNEC staff has access to \nthe necessary data and information. Second, while the SNEC will be expected to assist in the \noverall coordination of government policies, coordination across government ministries and \nagencies, especially in cross-cutting areas such as agricultural and rural development and \nregional integration, will continue to improve, as recently experienced during the review of the \nRectangular Strategy and the midterm review of the NSDP.13 There are two main risks: (i) that \nother government entities involved in policy formulation and coordination disagree with the \nSNEC\u2019s  analyses  and/or  do  not  extend  full  cooperation  to  SNEC,  thus  hindering  its \neffectiveness; and (ii) that capacity development is slower than anticipated as some staff may \nopt to leave once they have benefited from training opportunities. The first risk is mitigated by \nthe  Prime  Minister\u2019s  ability  to  override  interagency  coordination  problems  or  settle  policy \ndifferences, and by the expected continued strengthening of policy coordination mentioned \nabove.  The  second  risk  is  mitigated  by  SNEC\u2019s  reputation  as  a  prestigious  government \ninstitution, where job satisfaction is directly related to the quality of the outputs produced by \nstaff.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.   The TA is estimated to cost $900,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction Fund (RCPRF) and administered by ADB, while $150,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance $250,000. Detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan is provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.   The  executing  agency  (EA)  for  the  TA  will  be  SNEC,  with  the  chairperson  and/or \npermanent vice-chairperson serving as the principal coordinator(s). SNEC will provide office \nspace for the international and national consultants, including basic furnishings and support staff. \nThe permanent vice chairperson will also act as the full-time counterpart staff of the international \n                                                 \n13 Coordination between the Government and development partners is expected to be further enhanced through an \nongoing dialogue to improve the effectiveness of existing development cooperation structure. It is being carried out \nthrough 19 technical working groups (TWGs), periodic Government Donor Coordination Committee (GDCC) \nmeetings, and an annual Cambodia Development Cooperation Forum (CDCF). The GDCC, which is chaired by the \nMinister of Economy and Finance, settles issues which are not resolved at TWG level. The CDCF, which is chaired \nby the Prime Minister, reviews the performance of the TWG and GDCC, and highlights future development policies \nand priorities of the Government. In addition, a Government Private Sector Forum, which is also chaired by the \nPrime Minister, meets twice a year on specific issues raised by the private sector.  \n  \n \n ", "6                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                       \n   \nconsultant. The international consultant will be the consultant team leader for the TA, with \nsupport from Cambodia Resident Mission staff, and will offer advice on the selection of the \nnational consultants, and ensure the quality and timeliness of their outputs. \n \n17.   The TA will support (i) one economic policy adviser (international consultant) providing 6 \nperson-months of services, performed intermittently in 6 visits over 36 months, and (ii) up to 80 \nperson-months of long-term and short-term national consulting services, including those of an IT \nspecialist, on an intermittent basis. The long- and short-term national consultants (up to 6 in \ntotal) would be specialists in the following areas: macroeconomics, monetary and fiscal policy, \nagricultural and rural development, infrastructure, trade and regional integration, and private \nsector development. The IT specialist would be responsible for selecting and setting up the \ncomputers, printers, server, and related accessories, internet facilities, and customized software, \nand providing essential basic training to enable SNEC staff to fulfill their work program. The \nequipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  All  IT  equipment  would  be  turned  over  to  the  SNEC  upon \ncompletion of the TA. The short-term consultants, who would be sector specialists, are expected \nto be recruited on a needs basis. The consultant terms of reference are presented in Appendix \n3.14 While ADB\u2019s Project Administration Instructions15 specifies that a firm should be recruited \nwhen three or more experts are required for a particular assignment, it is proposed that the \nconsultants be recruited individually16 because no single firm in Cambodia has the required \nbreadth of local expertise across all the core areas to be covered. All consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n \n18.   The economic policy adviser (international consultant) will submit to ADB an inception \nreport 1 month after the start of field services, half-yearly progress reports, a midterm report \nafter 18 months of implementation, a draft final report, and a final report at the conclusion of the \nTA. The inception report will include (i) a detailed work plan for the international consultant and \nexpected outputs, (ii) detailed terms of reference for the national consultants, and (iii) agreed \nupon indicators to monitor progress in achieving outputs and evaluating outcomes expected \nfrom the TA. \n \n19.   The TA is expected to be implemented over 3 years, beginning in January 2009. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.
