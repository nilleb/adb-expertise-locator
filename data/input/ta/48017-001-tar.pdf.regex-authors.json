INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During  the  2013  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  technical \nassistance (TA) to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) for Developing \nInnovative Financing Mechanism and Incentive Policies to Promote Demand-Side Management \nin the Electricity Sector.1 The proposed TA was included in the country operations business plan, \n2014\u20132016 for the PRC.2  During the fact-finding mission in October 2014, agreement was \nreached with the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, and terms of reference for \nconsultants, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements.3 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  PRC  has  experienced  rapid  economic  growth,  supported  by  energy-intensive \nindustrialization,  to  become  the  largest  electricity  consumer  in  the  world  with  an  installed \nelectricity  generation  capacity  of  more  than  1,000  gigawatts  (GW).  The  government  has \nrecognized  the  challenges  presented  by  the  rapid  increase  in  the  electricity  and  energy \nconsumption and associated air pollution.4 Since 2006, specific targets were set for energy \nintensity reduction and conservation of primary energy (i.e., coal, natural gas, and oil) and \nelectricity.5 In addition, energy-intensive industries are encouraged to phase out inefficient and \nobsolete industrial capacity and invest in more advanced industrial processes. \n \n3.  The electricity subsector accounts for about half of the PRC\u2019s coal consumption and is a \nmajor contributor to the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and to local air pollution. The \nindustry sector in the PRC accounts for 56% of total electricity consumption. Thus, electricity \nsavings in the industry sector can play a major role in reducing the PRC\u2019s greenhouse gas \nemissions and urban air pollution. Despite improved energy intensity, energy consumption per \nunit of industrial output in the PRC exceeds that of other major economies such as the United \nStates, Japan, and advanced European countries.  \n \n4.  Despite large capacity additions, the PRC\u2019s electricity sector is struggling to meet the \ndemand, especially during the summer months. Electricity shortages are frequently experienced \nin  industrial  centers  in  the  Yangtze  and  Pearl  river  deltas  (i.e.,  Guangdong,  Jiangsu,  and \nZhejiang provinces) because of inadequate generation and transmission capacity. The peak-\ntime electricity capacity shortage has been estimated to be 40 GW (i.e., approximately 4% of \npeak demand). The electricity shortages have resulted in the use of inefficient diesel power \nplants by industries, which are economically inefficient and causes local air pollution.  \n \n5.   The PRC aims to increase the share of non-fossil fuel in the energy mix to 15% by 2020, \nwhich will require a significant increase in the use of wind, solar, and hydro power in electricity \ngeneration. Although the PRC has an installed wind and solar capacity in excess of 100 GW, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 October 2014. \n2  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n3  Since the TA prioritized policy reform related to the DSM, it was changed from capacity development TA to policy \nand advisory TA.  \n4  The energy and electricity sector in the PRC is heavily dependent on carbon and pollution-intensive coal, which \nprovides more than two-thirds of its energy and about 80% of electricity.  \n5  Energy intensity is defined as the energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product measured in constant \ncurrency. The energy intensity reached 1.276 tons of coal equivalent per CNY10,000 (tce/CNY10,000) in 2005 and \n1.034 tce/CNY10,000 in 2010 and 0.736 tce/CNY10,000 in 2013.  \n ", "2  \ntheir combined share in electricity generation is less than 3%. Moreover, wind and solar power \nplants  suffer  from  curtailment  due  to  inflexibility  in  the  power  system  and  transmission \nconstraints. 6 While the government has partly addressed this through increased investments in \nthe transmission network, greater flexibility in the power system is needed, including the ability \nto control electricity demand in real time in response to changes in the availability of renewable \nsources of electricity.  \n \n6.  The government has initiated DSM programs aimed at electricity savings and peak \ndemand reduction, which are supported through fiscal subsidies. In response, an energy service \ncompany  (ESCO)  industry  has  emerged  to  implement  these  projects  in  industrial  and \ncommercial installations using energy performance contracts.7 Since ESCOs are small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, they have limited access to debt financing, which is limiting their \nability to target larger projects. The ongoing investment subsidies by the government are not \nsustainable  in  the  long  term  and  have  not  been  successful  to  leverage  commercial  debt \nfinancing. Reforms of the existing subsidy mechanism are urgently needed to use the limited \ngovernment subsidies to leverage and mobilize funds from other sources to scale-up DSM and \nelectricity saving projects.  \n \n7.  The government issued a new regulation in April 2011 to govern the DSM for electricity \nload management. Although the regulation encourages local governments to deploy economic \nincentives  to  solicit  more  flexible  demand  from  large  electricity  consumers,  the  local \ngovernments  have  instead  preferred  to  use  administrative  measures  to  control  electricity \ndemand. However, these measures are economically inefficient and have high economic cost \nas they interrupt the production schedules of industries. Innovative policy reforms providing \nappropriate price signals and other market-based economic incentives are urgently needed to \nencourage industry consumers to offer flexible electricity demand. This demand-side flexibility is \ncrucial to balance the electricity demand and supply when faced with supply shortages or \nexcess due to high renewable energy generation.  \n \n8.  The government encourages wider applications of DSM through provision of technical \nand policy support and prioritizes it as a means to achieve  the total energy consumption cap by \n2015. The government set up the DSM Pilot City Award Fund to provide financial support to the \npilot cities. It launched a DSM pilot city program in 2011, under which four cities (i.e., Beijing, \nFoshan,  Suzhou,  and  Tangshan)  were  selected  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  a \ncomprehensive program to reduce the peak demand and reduce electricity consumption in \nindustrial facilities and commercial buildings. The pilot cities are encouraged to experiment with \ninnovating policy mechanisms and market-based solutions to create experiences in DSM that \ncould be replicated in other parts and regions of the PRC.  \n \n9.  The proposed TA is a timely response to (i) conduct a comprehensive assessment of, \nand  gather  the  lessons  from,  the  first  batch  of  DSM  pilots;  (ii)  recommend  an  innovative \nfinancing mechanism to diversify DSM investments;  (iii) enable the scaling up of DSM pilot \ncities  and  make  it  market-driven  and  self-sustainable  and  (iv)  propose  a  market-driven \nmechanism to solicit demand response from large electricity consumers to optimize peak load \n                                                 \n6  Curtailment is the forced reduction of the output of renewable energy plants by the power system operator because \nof transmission constraints or surplus electricity generation due to the presence of inflexible thermal power plants. \nWind power curtailment in the PRC is estimated to be 20% of the available generation.  \n7  ESCOs are specialized entities with proprietary energy-saving technologies. They invest in energy-saving projects \nlocated at third-party installations (i.e., industrial and commercial) and share a portion of the monetary value of \nenergy savings realized according to the provisions of the energy performance contract between the ESCO and \nthe host company.  \n ", "  3\nmanagement. The TA is closely aligned with the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 objectives of \nfacilitating knowledge transfer in state-of-the-art technologies and market practices as well as \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy and energy sector strategy for the PRC, which seek to \npromote  energy  efficiency,  resource  conservation,  and  increased  utilization  of  renewable \nenergy.8  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be reduced peak demand and electricity consumption through DSM. The \noutcome will be the implementation of market-based policies and reforms to scale-up DSM \nfinancing implemented.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will (i) review and assess the ongoing programs, actions and policies in support \nof the DSM, (ii) conduct stakeholder consultations to obtain feedback on existing DSM incentive \npolicies and DSM pilots in the PRC, (iii) review the relevance and applicability of international \nexperience in DSM in advanced economies, and (iv) compare and contrast different financing \ntools and models to best leverage private resources to scale-up  DSM investments by 2015 and \nbeyond. The TA will also examine and propose a financing mechanism for scaling up DSM \ninvestments and propose a suitable institutional setup.  \n \n12.  The TA will have three outputs: \n(i)  Output 1. The TA will review and assess existing policies to promote DSM, peak \nload management, and the performance of the DSM pilot city program. It will also \ncompare  and  contrast  DSM  management  and  incentive  policies  in  major \neconomies  and  identify  international  practices  applicable  to  the  PRC.  Initial \nfindings will be presented in stakeholder workshops to obtain feedback and to \nfurther refine and improve the assessment report.   \n(ii)  Output 2. The TA will identify the systematic barriers for ESCOs\u2019 financing for \nelectricity-saving DSM projects and will propose financial products, including risk-\nsharing arrangements for leveraging commercial banks and the private sector \ninvestments  for  the  DSM.  It  will  also  propose  a  suitable  financing  platform \nbringing  together  local  governments,  electricity  utility  companies,  commercial \nbanks, and other financing institutions. The institutional arrangement of such  \nplatform will also be elaborated.   \n(iii)  Output  3. The TA will propose recommendations on market-based incentive \npolicies to promote demand response such as payment of ancillary services \nprovided by  the grid operator. It will analyze how to promote DSM through \ndemand response pricing and the role of demand response aggregators and the \ndistributed energy storage system in the PRC. Recommendations on incentive \npolicies, demand response strategy, and regulatory framework will be proposed.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2014.
