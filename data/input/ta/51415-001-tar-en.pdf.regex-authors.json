INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Bank of Mongolia \n(BOM) in implementing medium-term banking sector strengthening reforms.1 The TA will focus \non (i) upgrading bank ownership and accountability frameworks, (ii) improving reporting and \nregulation of bank assets, and (iii) promoting new financial products and business models. The \nTA is an integral part of Asian Development Bank (ADB) support for finance sector stability, and \nthe continued development of BOM\u2019s prudential capacity under pillar 1 of the country partnership \nstrategy, 2017\u20132020.2 The TA is included in the country operations and business plan, 2021.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Following economic liberalization in the 1990s, Mongolia has experienced rapid financial \ndeepening centered on its banking system and achieved substantial progress in the household \naccess to financial services.4 However, the stability of the banking sector, which constitutes more \nthan  90%  of  the  country\u2019s  finance  sector,  continues  to  be  affected  by  the  high-level  of \nnonperforming loans (NPLs), inadequate capital, and weak governance. The officially reported \nNPL ratio increased from 7.4% in January 2018 to 10.7% in June 2020. The coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic has added to the banking sector\u2019s challenges: past-due loans grew 35% \nfrom December 2019 to April 2020.5 Based on the asset quality review done in 2017, about 2% \nof gross domestic product was needed to recapitalize several banks.6 On 23 October 2020 the \nFinancial Action Task Force took Mongolia off the list of countries with strategic deficiencies.7 \nBank lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is low, and access to credit is a \nmajor obstacle to doing business in Mongolia. \n \n3.  Commercial banks in Mongolia operate as limited liability companies whose ownership is \nhighly concentrated in a small number of influential shareholders.8 There were instances when \ndecisions on transferring bank ownership or mergers were done without properly informing small \nshareholders. Undisclosed beneficial ownership of some banks by government and elected \nofficials creates conflicts of interest, impairing supervisory oversight. Controlling interests in banks \nshareholdings are not regulated or vetted. Unlike listed joint stock companies, the limited liability \n \n1  BOM. 2020. Banking Sector Reform Program for 2020\u20132023 (Decree of the Governor of the Bank of Mongolia no. \nA-366 dated 14 September 2020) Ulaanbaatar. The program has five objectives: (i) improve the legal environment \nto reduce shareholder concentration and enhance good governance of the sector; (ii) enhance sector regulations \nand supervisions in line with international best practices; (iii) continue collaboration with international professional \ninstitutions to strengthen the sector; (iv) improve the effectiveness of anti-money laundering and combating the \nfinancing of terrorism systems, get out of the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s grey list, and prepare for the next joint \nassessments; and (v) promote digital banking and specialized banking services. BOM must report on the program\u2019s \nimplementation to the Economic Standing Committee of the Parliament on the first quarter of each year. \n2  ADB. 2017.

Manila. The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 September 2020. \n4  M. Helble, H. Hill, and D. Magee, eds. 2020. Mongolia\u2019s Economic Prospects: Resource-Rich and Landlocked \nBetween Two Giants. Manila: ADB. \n5  Mongolian Bankers Association (MBA). Banking Sector Review: Covid-19 Economic and Financial Look, Quarter 1, \n2020. Ulaanbaatar. \n6  The asset quality review was done under the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Extended Fund Facility Program \napproved in May 2017 and closed (uncompleted) in May 2020. Inappropriate post-review equity injections and \nregulatory forbearance led to unclarity about selected banks\u2019 compliance with prudential capital adequacy ratios. \n7  The Financial Action Task Force put Mongolia on the list of countries with strategic deficiencies in anti-money \nlaundering and counter-terrorism financing in October 2019. \n8  Banks running as limited liability companies with high shareholder concentration tend to engage in riskier operations \nand have higher levels of impaired assets. \n ", "2 \ncompany form allows the banks to have less robust and accountable corporate governance and \navoid public disclosure of information. Existing regulations do not clearly support the public listing \nof  bank shares  on the  stock  exchange. Inadequate  banking  sector  corporate  restructuring \nregulations,  including  on  mergers  and  acquisitions,  constrain the  potential  for  bank capital \naugmentation. \n \n4.  The  financial  reporting  in  the  banking  sector  lags  international  standards  and  risk \nmanagement  remains  uneven.  Although  BOM  has  been  strengthening  macro-prudential \nmeasures  and  related-party  disclosure  transparency,  other  banking  sector  reforms  have \nprogressed  slowly.  For  example,  implementation  of  the  International  Financial  Reporting \nStandard 9 (IFRS 9) was postponed from January to December 2020.9 Bank systems and \ncapacity  need  stronger  asset  classification  and  provisioning,  collateral  valuation,  NPL \nmanagement, and loan origination and risk management, especially in small banks with one \ndominant owner. In addition, widespread nonconformance with international capital adequacy and \nbanking supervision standards impair banks\u2019 capacity to sustain shocks. BOM\u2019s supervisory \ncapacity is still evolving, including in effective oversight over commercial banks\u2019 NPLs.10 There is \nlittle investor interest in recapitalizing banks because of concerns over solvency, low profitability, \nweak governance, and lack of transparency on the banks\u2019 condition. \n \n5.  The government has a financial market development program until 2025, but coordination \nof the finance sector development is fragmented.11 BOM, the Financial Regulatory Commission, \nthe Ministry of Finance, and the Development Bank of Mongolia are primarily guided by their own \nstrategies and programs. The lack of a genuine whole-of-sector development plan contributed to \nthe dearth of digital financial instruments and business models in the banking sector and the lack \nof a supervisory framework for financial technology (fintech).12 This is despite the significant \npotential to address the inherent issues with inadequate credit history and collateral under \nconventional bank lending to the private sector, particularly to microbusinesses and SMEs. Given \nMongolia\u2019s dispersed population distribution, it is important to step up the development of digital \nfinancial services and business models in the banking sector to ease access to finance by \nbusinesses while preserving sector stability. \n \n6.  In June 2020, the Governor of BOM established the Banking Restructuring and Policy \nDepartment  (BRPD)  to,  among  other  tasks,  improve  the  policies  and  regulations  on  bank \nownership and public listing, financial reporting and risk management, and new bank products \nand business models. The TA will help strengthen the capacity and policies of BOM, in general, \nand BRPD, in particular, to be ready to implement measures in the priority areas of the Banking \nSector Reform Program (footnote 1). The TA is an integral part of ADB\u2019s comprehensive and \nsustained support for finance sector development in Mongolia. The TA will enable continued \nsupport for the implementation of the 2017\u20132020 medium-term reform framework of the ADB-\nsupported Banking Sector Rehabilitation and Financial Stability Strengthening Program and help \n \n9  IFRS. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. IFRS 9 addresses the accounting for financial instruments and contains three \nmain topics: classification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge \naccounting. The standard came into force on 1 January 2018 and requires a recognition of credit loss allowances \non initial recognition of financial assets, not when a credit loss event has occurred. \n10  There are no frameworks for resolving the high level of NPLs and bank recapitalization. The 22 June 2018 Banking \nSector  Stability  Law  that  enables  recapitalization  of  commercial  banks  with  public  funds  has  yet  to  be \noperationalized. The regulatory forbearance has resulted in banks rescheduling past due loans and NPLs leniently. \n11  Government  of  Mongolia.  2017.

The TA follows the recommendation in the \nprogram\u2019s completion report that ADB should expand and deepen support to the finance sector \nand that future finance sector operations should focus on the banking sector reforms.13 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: investor confidence in Mongolia\u2019s banking \nsector increased and financial intermediation expanded.14 The TA will have the following outcome: \nregulation and management for promoting governance, stability, and development of the banking \nsector improved.15 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output  1:  Policy  advice  on  regulatory  frameworks  on  bank  ownership  and \naccountability finalized. This output will support (i) assessing BOM\u2019s rules and supervision of \nbanks\u2019 significant and ultimate ownership (held directly, indirectly and by related parties);16 (ii) \npreparing regulations on bank mergers and acquisitions,17 maximum investments, approval of \nsignificant shareholders, the rights of minority shareholders, and control changes; (iii) designing \nbank  ownership  prudential  conditions  and  criteria;  (iv)  strengthening  the  regulation  and \nsupervision of bank transparency and information disclosure, and bank corporate affiliations or \nstructures to mitigate undue exposure risks for the banks; and (v) raising BOM\u2019s capacity to \nidentify and address the concerns on bank ownership, control, and mergers and acquisitions. This \noutput will also support assessing legal, regulatory, accounting, taxation, market capacity, and \ninvestor depth issues; proposing options; and preparing a roadmap on banks\u2019 public listing.18 An \nimportant precondition for implementing this output will be the adoption of the amendments to the \nBanking Law (2010) as the proposed amendments will provide the legal basis for reducing bank \nownership concentration and enabling the public listing of banks.19 \n \n9.  Output 2: Guidelines on reporting and regulation of banks\u2019 assets updated. This \noutput will help (i) assess financial instrument accounting systems of selected commercial banks \nagainst IFRS 9; (ii) analyze the impact of IFRS 9 on banking sector prudential ratios and develop \na transition plan for BOM; (iii) update the accounting guidelines to be in line with IFRS 9 and test \nthem in selected banks; and (iv) build the IFRS 9 capacity of the staff of BOM, commercial banks, \nconcerned government agencies, and professional organizations. To mitigate building up of NPLs, \nthis output will also support knowledge sharing and strengthening of the capacity of the banks, \n \n13  ADB. 2020.

The working group is expected to \ninclude BOM, Finance Regulatory Commission, and the Mongolian Stock Exchange. The TA will seek to promote \nmainstreaming green principles in the public listing of banks. \n19  Parliament of Mongolia. Draft Law on Amendments to the Banking Law. Amendments to the Banking Law were \nsubmitted for the Parliament\u2019s consideration on 20 August 2020. \n ", "4 \nBOM, and the Mongolian Bankers Association (MBA) in risk management and handling NPLs \nupon elimination of regulatory forbearance and implementation of IFRS 9. \n \n10.  Output 3: Digital financial products and business models promoted. This output will \nsupport (i) conducting a midterm assessment of the government\u2019s financial market reform and \ndevelopment program and recommendations for 2021\u20132025;20 (ii) strengthening regulations to \npromote new digital financial products and financial models that would ease access of micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises to finance beyond traditional banking models (e.g., digital \ninfrastructure for digital financial services, digital contracts, e-signature, e-know-your-client, digital \nbanking, and credit scoring based on big data analytics); (iii) improving linkages between digital \nfinancing and e-commerce; and (iv) sharing knowledge from the international success stories in \nfintech and digital banking.21 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA. BOM, through BRPD, will be the executing agency.

BRPD will assign one primary and one back-up senior level staff \nagency  from its Policy Division to support the project, including in providing information, \nfacilitating meetings with government staff, helping organize discussions and workshops, \nand coordinating inputs and comments to the consultants\u2019 deliverables. \nInteragency  BOM will establish an interagency working group chaired by BRPD and comprising the \nworking  director general or director of (i) BOM\u2019s Supervisory Department, and Legal Department, \ngroup  (ii) MOF\u2019s FPD, (iii) FRC\u2019s ICD,b and (iv) MSE\u2019s Operations Department. The working \ngroup will meet at least every 6 months to review the TA status and will report to BOM \nmanagement on the status of TA implementation and other matters related to the TA. \nADB\u2019s TA project officer or the Mongolia Resident Mission-based project team member \nmay join the meetings upon request. \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm: quality- and cost-based  Banking reform advisory and  $700,000 \nselection (80:20)  capacity building consultantc \nIndividual consultant selection  E-commerce, digital finance,  $20,000 \nnew business models experts \n \n20  Work on this item will build on the Bond Market Guide on Mongolia completed by ADB\u2019s Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department in March 2020 and on the road map for corporate bond market development \ndeveloped under phase 2 of the Japan International Cooperation Agency\u2019s Capacity Building of Capital Market in \nMongolia Project. It will be coordinated with the capital market diagnostic and roadmap development for Mongolia \nunder ADB\u2019s proposed regional TA on Capital Market Development and Reform in Developing Asia (Phase 1). \nStrategic assessment of the potential for introducing open banking in Mongolia will be also conducted. \n21  For example, the experience of the Ant Financial Services Group and WeChat Pay in digital banking and payments. \n ", "5 \nDisburse- Disbursement of TA resources will follow ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nment  Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BOM = Bank of Mongolia, BRPD = Banking Restructuring And Policy Department, \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, FPD = Financial Policy Department, FRC = Financial Regulatory Commission, ICD \n= International Cooperation Department, MOF = Ministry of Finance, MSE = Mongolian Stock Exchange, TA = technical \nassistance.  \na  The implementation period considers the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated travel \nand gathering restrictions. If the restrictions are lifted or become flexible enough to enable faster implementation of \nthe TA, then the TA may be completed earlier than anticipated. \nb  Depending on need, FRC\u2019s Securities Department, Nonbank Financial Institutions Department, and Market \nResearch and Development Department will be co-opted to the meetings of the interagency working group. \nc  Given the international travel uncertainty because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the consultant\u2019s presence in \nMongolia and ability to deliver the required capacity building in the country will be a strong merit. The TA consultants \nand other relevant parties may be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement with BOM. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n13.  Consulting services. ADB will recruit a consulting firm (association of firms) to deliver \nthe activities under the TA.22 The firm, which will be engaged through quality- and cost-based \nselection under a partial lump-sum contract using performance (output)-based terms of reference, \nwill comprise international (15 person-months) and national experts (24 person-months) on             \n(i) banking (ownership, control, mergers and acquisitions, asset-liability management); (ii) legal \naspects  of  banking  (corporate  governance,  legal  form,  public  listing,  fintech);  (iii)  financial \nmanagement (bank accounting); (iv) finance sector development (banks, non-banks, capital \nmarket); and (v) fintech. The TA will also engage experts renowned in e-commerce, digital finance, \nand new business models to facilitate knowledge transfers from the regional countries\u2019 successful \nexperiences. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and its associated procurement instructions. \n \n14.  Coordination with banking industry. BOM will seek to arrange the use of MBA\u2019s sub-\ngroups on legal issues, risk management, and digital products as platforms for consultations with \nthe banking sector and development partners for the TA\u2019s outputs. Upon establishment of such \nan arrangement, the consulting firm will use the concerned MBA sub-group to seek inputs to and \ncomments on the deliverables, and to disseminate the final products.23 During the TA semiannual \nreview missions, ADB will evaluate the TA progress based on the performance targets and \nindicators in the design and monitoring framework and will organize coordination meetings with \nthe development partners. \n \nIV.
