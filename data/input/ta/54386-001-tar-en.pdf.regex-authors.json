INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  the  participating \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to promote the life \ncycle management of fluorocarbons.1 The life cycle management of fluorocarbons requires (i) \ndeveloping, manufacturing, and using climate-friendly refrigerants with zero or low global warming \npotential (GWP) as an alternative to fluorocarbons with high GWP, which includes replacing old \ncooling  equipment  (upstream);  and  (ii)  recovering,  recycling,  and  destroying  the  discarded \nfluorocarbons  (midstream  and  downstream).  The  replacement  of  old  equipment  with  new \ntechnologies also leads to energy efficiency and fewer carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions from \n2\nenergy sources by reducing the use of electricity generated through the combustion of fossil fuels. \nADB's technical and capacity-building support will focus on the energy efficiency measures \nassociated with the life cycle management of fluorocarbons. \n \n2.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  priorities  relating  to  climate  change  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement of ADB's Work Program and Budget Framework, 2021\u20132023 and is included in the \n2021 ADB Management-approved results-based work plan of the Sustainable Development and \nClimate Change Department (SDCC). The TA is one of the concrete actions taken by ADB as a \nsignatory of the Initiative on Fluorocarbons Life Cycle Management (IFL), which Japan's Ministry \nof the Environment initiated in December 2019 at the 25th session of the Conference of Parties \nto the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.2 \n \n3.  The TA will be a part of ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Program (CMP). Established in 2006, the \nCMP is one of the flagship climate change initiatives of ADB; it provides technical support and \ncarbon finance to greenhouse gas mitigation projects in DMCs.3 The TA will be a part of the CMP\u2019s \nTechnical Support Facility, one of the main instruments through which ADB assists its DMCs in \ntaking more mitigation actions through carbon markets. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  It is estimated that 3.6 billion cooling appliances are in use globally for space cooling, \nstationary refrigeration, and mobile cooling; and that up to 14 billion cooling appliances would be \nrequired by 2050 if cooling were to be provided to all those who need it.4 The growing demand \nfor cooling equipment will increase global warming effects because of the emissions from \nhydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and other old refrigerants used in such equipment, and from CO  \n2\nemissions  where  the  appliances  rely  on  electricity  from  fossil  fuel-based  energy  sources. \nHydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are commonly used as \nrefrigerants in cooling equipment and in aerosols and are very potent greenhouse gases.5 HCFCs \nand CFCs are ozone-depleting substances that are very harmful to the environment if released \ninto the air through leakage or improper disposal of cooling equipment. Recognizing the impact \n \n1  Fluorocarbons: any of various chemically inert compounds containing carbon and fluorine used chiefly as lubricants, \nrefrigerants, and nonstick coatings. \n2  The TA is aligned with one of the key items of the joint work program (2020\u20132022) that ADB has agreed with Japan's \nMinistry of the Environment under the Letter of Intent on Cooperation for Environment between the two sides. The \nTA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 February 2021. \n3  The CMP currently includes the (i) Future Carbon Fund, (ii) Technical Support Facility, (iii) Japan Fund for the Joint \nCrediting Mechanism, and (iv) Article 6 Support Facility. New funds and facilities for the CMP are being developed. \n4  United Nations Environment Programme and International Energy Agency. 2020. Cooling Emissions and Policy \nSynthesis Report: Benefits of cooling efficiency and the Kigali Amendment. Nairobi and Paris. \n5  HCFCs and CFCs have high GWP values relative to CO2\u2014ranging from 79 to 1,980 for HCFCs and from 4,660 to \n13,900 for CFCs\u2014for the 100-year time horizon. Source: Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Global Warming Protocol \nValues. \n ", "2 \nof HCFCs, CFCs, and other substances on the ozone layer, countries came together in 1987 to \nfinalize the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to phase out the production of these \nsubstances. As an alternative to HFCFs and CFCs, HFCs were developed as new refrigerants \nfor cooling equipment. However, HFCs are also greenhouse gases with a very high GWP value \nof 4 to 12,400 relative to CO for the 100-year time horizon (GWP Values, footnote 5). The use of \n2 \nHFCs has increased rapidly as global demand for air conditioners and refrigerators continues to \ngrow. Global HFC emissions are increasing by 10%\u201315% annually and are expected to reach \nbetween 5.5 gigatons and 8.8 gigatons of CO  equivalent (CO e) per year by 2050, which is \n2 2\nequivalent to 9%\u201319% (CO e basis) of projected global CO  emissions in 2050 in a business-as-\n2 2\nusual scenario.6 Recognizing this, countries adopted the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal \nProtocol in 2016, agreeing to gradually reduce the use of HFCs by more than 80% by 2047. \n \n5.  Despite the international commitments in place, it is estimated that global cumulative \nemissions of fluorocarbons from 2020 to 2060 are likely to be 63\u201369 gigatons of CO e. Some \n2\nDMCs have no laws or policies to curtail HFC emissions. Even among the countries that do, only \na few have systems in place to enforce, or at least provide incentives for, the proper management \nof fluorocarbons. Therefore, it is critical to promote the life cycle management of fluorocarbons \nand the associated energy efficiency improvements in the cooling industry (e.g., space cooling, \nstationary refrigeration, and mobile cooling) to meet the obligations under the Montreal Protocol \nand its amendments, as well as the Paris Agreement goals. \n \n6.  Contributions  to  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  and  ADB\u2019s  operational \npriorities under Strategy 2030. The TA will directly contribute to Sustainable Development Goal \n(SDG) 13 (climate action) and ADB\u2019s operational priority 3 by helping DMCs promote or even \nenforce fluorocarbon life cycle management and energy efficiency in the cooling industry. In \naddition, the TA will contribute to SDG 5 (gender equality) and ADB\u2019s operational priority 2 by \nensuring women\u2019s full participation in capacity-building and awareness-raising opportunities \nunder the TA. The TA will indirectly contribute to SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure) \nby preparing investment projects to develop the infrastructure for the life cycle management of \nfluorocarbons and help the cooling industry to be energy efficient and sustainable. \n \n7.  Cooling systems are indispensable for human health in hot climates, and for storing and \ntransporting food and medical supplies, which has become more evident during the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic. To ensure the sustainability of cooling systems, it is critical to \npromote proper fluorocarbon life cycle management and energy efficiency. Improvements in the \npractices of the cooling industry will also boost the capacity and resilience of participating DMCs \nto respond to COVID-19 and any similar shocks in the future. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: use of zero or low GWP refrigerants in the \ncooling industry increased in participating DMCs, and use of energy-efficient cooling technologies \nincreased in participating DMCs.7 The TA will have the following outcome: DMCs\u2019 actions to \npromote the life cycle management of fluorocarbons and associated energy efficiency in the \n \n6  G. J. M. Velders et al. 2009. The large contribution of projected HFC emissions to future climate forcing. Proceedings \nof the National Academy of Sciences Jul 2009. 106 (27) 10949-10954. \n7  Defined by the TA. \n ", "3 \ncooling industry increased.8 The outcome indicator will be that by 2023, (i) the recommendations \non the life cycle management of fluorocarbons and associated energy efficiency gains in the \ncooling industry are incorporated into national plans, policies, and/or laws in at least one DMC; \nand (ii) at least one new investment and/or a project component dedicated to the life cycle \nmanagement of fluorocarbons and associated energy efficiency measures in the cooling industry \nis included in the ADB pipeline. The target fluorocarbons are HCFCs, CFCs, and HFCs. Since \ntheir life cycle management includes the collection, treatment, and disposal or destruction of \nobsolete and inefficient cooling equipment, the TA will also contribute to better solid waste \nmanagement (i.e., handling of used cooling appliances) in each of the participating DMCs. The \nTA will focus on DMCs that have joined the IFL (para. 2), such as Maldives, Mongolia, the \nPhilippines, and Viet Nam; or are considering to join it and have economies of a size and structure \nthat promise high demand for this TA support and high potential impact, such as Indonesia and \nThailand. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Developing  member  countries\u2019  knowledge  and  awareness  of,  and \ncapacity for the life cycle management of fluorocarbons increased. The TA team will identify \nand assess the current policies, laws, and regulations in participating DMCs with reference to \nglobal good practices, including through desktop analysis and consultation with relevant entities \nfrom the public and private sectors. The team will prepare a gap analysis to assess the current \nstate of the life cycle management of fluorocarbons and the associated energy consumption in \neach participating DMCs. The analysis will inform the recommendations to be developed under \noutput 3. The team will also disseminate the knowledge gained under the TA to a wider range of \nstakeholders in the Asia and Pacific region through workshops and a knowledge product. The \nincreased knowledge, awareness, and capacity of the stakeholders in the participating DMCs will \nbe the basis for achieving the outcome. \n \n10.  Output 2: Options for advanced technologies and innovative solutions suitable for \ndeveloping member countries\u2019 local practices related to the life cycle management of \nfluorocarbons  identified.  The  TA  team  will  study  the  options  for  introducing  advanced \ntechnologies, other innovative solutions, and available business models that would foster the \nuptake of fluorocarbon life cycle management and associated energy efficiency improvements by \nthe cooling industry in each participating DMC. The study will inform the recommendations to be \ndeveloped under output 3. \n \n11.  Output 3: Recommendations for the developing member countries to promote the \nlife cycle management of fluorocarbons prepared. Based on the assessments under outputs 1 \nand 2, the TA team will first develop a series of options broadly applicable to DMCs to promote \nthe life cycle management of fluorocarbons and associated energy efficiency in the cooling \nindustry. Users of cooling equipment, both in the public and private sectors, will be closely \nconsulted throughout the preparation of the recommendations. Based on the options, the team \nwill tailor its recommendations to the participating DMCs, which they can use for national action \nplans, policy reforms, amendments to laws and/or regulations, and investment opportunities \ndepending on the local context. The TA team will explore and recommend the possible use of \ncarbon market mechanisms under the Paris Agreement, such as the Joint Crediting Mechanism, \nto encourage investments in the life cycle management of fluorocarbons and associated energy \nefficiency improvements by the cooling industry. Assuming that the participating DMCs are able \nto sustain their commitment to the Montreal Protocol and its Kigali Amendment, and to the Paris \n \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nAgreement, it is highly likely that the outcome will be achieved if the participating DMCs will \nfavorably receive the recommendations prepared under output 3 and apply these in their national \nplans, policies, and/or laws. \n \n12.  The TA is innovative because it aims to develop recommendations for participating DMCs \nto incorporate the new concept of life cycle management of fluorocarbons into their national laws, \nregulations, and/or policies. These recommendations may also serve as the basis for developing \nnew projects to support the life cycle management of fluorocarbons with innovative technologies \nand business models, which could transform the greenhouse gas emission profile of the cooling \nindustry in the participating DMCs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the Asian \nClean  Energy  Fund  (ACEF)9 under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  and \nadministered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n14.  The use of ACEF for the TA will follow the implementation guidelines of ACEF, including \nthe list of ineligible expenditure items, such as: (i) purchases of vehicles, (ii) salaries for civil \nservants, (iii) scholarships or internships, and (iv) civil works and other related expenses. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. SDCC will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; \norganize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons in the workshops. The Climate \nChange and Disaster Risk Management Division of SDCC will lead the overall implementation \nand coordinate closely with the relevant sector and thematic groups under SDCC and ADB\u2019s \noperations  departments.10 International  and  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  through \nindividual consultant selection. \n \n16.
