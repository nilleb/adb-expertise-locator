INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Viet Nam has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ntechnical assistance (TA)to undertake a study on climate change impact and adaptation in the \n \nMekong Delta.1 The TA supports the Government\u2019s National Target Plan (NTP) for responding \nto climate change, as well as Viet Nam\u2019s commitments under the United Nations Framework \nConvention  on  Climate  Change.  It  complements the  Government\u2019s  national  socioeconomic \ndevelopment plan and Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy.2 A TA fact-\nfinding mission visited Viet Nam and reached agreement with the Government on TA impact, \noutcome, outputs, activities, cost, implementation and financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam is one of the countries likely to be most affected by global climate change.3 \nWithin Viet Nam, the Mekong Delta region, in the south of the country, has been identified as \nparticularly susceptible to the impacts of extreme climate events and climate variability. The \nMekong Delta region is home to one-fifth of the national population and has population densities \nthat are among the highest in the country. There is a large proportion of poor and near-poor \nhouseholds, and the population remains predominantly rural. Agriculture and fisheries are the \nmajor sources of income for the large majority of the people. The area is known as the \u201crice \nbowl\u201d of Viet Nam. Approximately 10,000 square kilometers (km2) of the delta are under rice \ncultivation, and the region contributes 46% of the total national food production. \n \n3.  The Mekong Delta region has experienced severe effects of climate events. Major floods \nin 2000 destroyed more than 400,000 hectares (ha) of rice paddies, 85,000 ha of farmland, and \n16,000 ha of shrimp and fish ponds. With global climate change, the extent and frequency of \nextreme events are expected to intensify. Increased extent and duration of flooding, changes in \nwet season and dry season precipitation, inundation from a rising sea level, and changes in \nsalinity intrusion will be significant threats to the region\u2019s agricultural and fisheries productivity, \nas well as to remaining natural coastal ecosystems. Effects on livelihoods and food security for \nthe region\u2019s population are likely to be significant. Poor households are likely to be the most \nvulnerable to the effects of climate change.  \n \n4.  Approximately 12,300 km2, or 31%, of the total land area of the Mekong Delta, including \n9,800 km2 of land used for agriculture and aquaculture, could be affected by a 1.0-meter rise in \nsea level that could occur by 2100. About 4.8 million people could be affected by such a change \nin sea level, including more than 1.5 million poor individuals. Energy and road infrastructure in \nthe  region  is  also  susceptible  to  effects  of  climate  change  that  include  flooding,  salinity, \ntemperature changes, and availability of water resources.  \n \n5.  A number of ongoing assistance efforts relating to climate change are provided by \nvarious development partners, including the World Bank\u2019s Economics of Adaptation to Climate \nChange  Project;  initiatives  by  United  Nations  Development  Programme  in  relation  to \nmainstreaming climate change issues in socioeconomic development planning; and initiatives \nby the Danish and Dutch governments to develop climate change adaptation plans for a series \nof  coastal  provinces.  Despite  the  importance  of  the  region  to  national  socioeconomic \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 July 2009. \n2  Government of Viet Nam. 2002.

Manila.  \n ", " 2   \ndevelopment and its vulnerability to climate change, no comprehensive study of the potential \neffects of climate change has been undertaken to date. The capacity of government authorities \nin the region in relation to climate change issues is low, and, despite a long history of disaster \nmanagement  response  planning,  regional  sector  and  socioeconomic  development  planning \nincludes scant reference to climate change adaptation measures. Therefore, effective climate \nchange adaptation measures need urgently to be developed and integrated into the region\u2019s \ndevelopment planning to enhance the physical and economic climate-resilience of the region, \nand in particular to protect poor and rural households.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The expected impact is that poor and rural people in the Mekong Delta region will have \ndeveloped physical and economic resilience to future climate change and variability. The TA will \ncontribute to the Government\u2019s socioeconomic development goals of poverty reduction and \ncontinued economic growth as contained in the national socioeconomic development plan and \nthe Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. It will also contribute to fulfilling the \ngoals of the NTP in relation to addressing climate change issues within a context of poverty \nalleviation and sustainable development.  \n \n7.  The expected outcome is that sector and provincial authorities in the Mekong Delta region \nwill have developed the capacity to increase climate-resilience of programs, plans, policies, \nand/or projects to guide future development planning. This outcome will result in increased  \nclimate change resilience in the region and contribute to poverty reduction through (i) climate-\nproofed socioeconomic development planning at provincial level (e.g., urban land use planning \nto avoid flooding of sensitive areas, adjusting agricultural patterns to adapt to changing drought \nor salinity conditions, providing such protective infrastructure as dikes, or enhancing natural \nprotective ecosystems); (ii) adoption of regional adaptation measures to protect agricultural \nproduction and thus the livelihoods of poor, near poor, and rural households through structural \nand  nonstructural  measures;  and  (iii)  development  of  climate-resilient  infrastructure  in  the \ntransport and energy sectors that will aid in protecting the livelihoods of vulnerable groups, as \nwell as in supporting overall economic development. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Overview \n8.  The TA will be implemented in two parts. Part A is climate change prediction and impact \nassessment, while part B is climate change adaptation and planning. Part A will include output \n1:  identification  of  future  climate  conditions  in  the  Mekong  Delta  region;  and  output  2: \nassessment of the effects of future climate scenarios on natural, social, and economic systems \nin the Mekong Delta region. Part B will include output 3: identification of appropriate climate \nchange adaptation measures for target provinces and targeted regional sectors; and output 4: \ndevelopment of pilot projects for scaling up and replication of TA outcomes and support to \ncollaborative mechanisms for information sharing and coordinated action on climate change. \nBoth  parts  of  the  TA  will  incorporate  institutional  strengthening  activities  for  Government \ndecision makers and technical staff, as well as awareness raising activities for the community \n(output 5). A fundamental principle of the TA will be to implement a participatory approach \ninvolving national and provincial government representatives.  \n \n ", "    3\n9.  Target provinces selected for the TA are Ca Mau and Kien Giang. Kien Giang was \nchosen because it has a conventional coastal and insular environment with a westerly aspect \nthat is less exposed to mainstream hydrological influences. Existing community development \nand natural resources projects in this province will provide data sources and useful connections \nto local stakeholders. Ca Mau was selected as it is a large coastal province with a diverse \nmixture of land use types, remnant natural ecosystems, important infrastructure development in \nthe energy and transport sectors, and pockets of high poverty rates and ethnic minority groups. \n \n10.  Regional  sectors  targeted  for  the  TA  are  agriculture,  energy,  and  transport.  The \nagriculture sector was selected due to the region\u2019s importance to national food production and \nthe population\u2019s high reliance on agricultural activities for its livelihoods. Agriculture is identified \nas  a  key  sector  for  climate  change  adaptation  in  the  region,  and  it  is  the  subject  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s action plan for adaptation to climate change in agriculture and rural development. \nEnergy and transport were selected as target sectors due to (i) the vulnerability of energy and \ntransport  infrastructure  to  climate  change,  (ii)  the  importance  of  energy  and  transport \ninfrastructure to economic development and enhancing livelihoods among socially vulnerable \ngroups, and (iii) the presence of important national energy and transport infrastructure in the \nMekong Delta region. \n \n2.  Part A: Climate Change Prediction and Impact Assessment  \n11.  Output 1 will be achieved by modeling future climate change scenarios in 2030 and 2050. \nModeling activities will be undertaken initially at the regional level, with more detailed modeling \ncarried out for the regional target sectors and provinces. Modeling and data collection will build \non work already carried out by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) \nand donors. Global circulation models, regional downscaled models, and local and international \nclimate data will be employed as appropriate. Modeling will investigate threats related to rising \nsea level, storm surge, change in temperature patterns, change in rainfall patterns (including \ndrought frequency), and salinity patterns.  \n \n12.  Output 2 will be achieved by first carrying out an impact risk assessment at Mekong \nDelta regional level using an approach based on GIS (geographic information system) to identify \nthe effects of future climate change scenarios on natural systems (e.g., biodiversity, water \nresources and quality, soils.), social systems (e.g., population, poverty, gender, public health, \nurban  settlements),  economic  systems  (e.g.,  industry,  gross  domestic  product,  agricultural \nproduction), hydro-meteorological characteristics (e.g., flooding, sea levels and tides, salinity, \nriver flows), and important development sectors (including, but not limited to, the identified target \nsectors). Regional hotspots of climate change sensitivity, including vulnerable infrastructure \nitems in the target sectors, will be identified for use in the latter phases of the study and for \ndeveloping pilot projects under output 4. Integrated assessment modeling will then be carried \nout for target provinces and sectors to provide a more detailed assessment of climate change \neffects. The results of the integrated assessment modeling will provide important inputs to the \ncost-benefit analysis of adaptation options for target sectors and provinces. \n \n13.  Activities for output 5 will be commenced under part A. An analysis of existing climate \nchange capacity within the Government will be carried out as the baseline to develop a tailored \ncapacity  building  program  for  provincial  and  sector  authorities  (including  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation  framework).  Implementation  of  the  developed  program  will  then  begin.  Key \nparticipants in the activities will be from national line ministries in the target sectors, such as the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment, MONRE, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Industry and \n ", " 4   \nTrade,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  and  Viet  Nam  Electricity.  Also \nparticipating will be the ministries\u2019 provincial counterparts, such as the departments of Planning \nand Investment, Natural Resources and Environment (DONRE), Transport, Industry and Trade, \nand  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development.  A  community  awareness-raising  program  will  be \nimplemented within the two target provinces. \n \n3.  Part B: Climate Change Adaptation and Planning  \n14.  Output 3 will be achieved by identifying a long list of climate change adaptation options \nfor integration into future development planning for target sectors and provinces. This process \nwill use a \u201cno-regrets\u201d approach4 to identifying options and subjecting those options to economic, \nenvironmental, and social evaluation. The options should consider existing government polices, \nincluding the national strategy for natural disaster prevention. A prioritized list of feasible and \npractical adaptation options (both structural and nonstructural) will be developed for integration \ninto  the  development  planning  framework,  and  their  corresponding  budget  costs  for \nimplementation will be financed. Cost\u2013benefit analyses of selected adaptation measures in \ntarget  sectors  and  provinces  will  be  conducted,  together  with  economic  modeling  of  the \nadaptation measures\u2019 impacts. Authorities will also be assisted in identifying financing options \nfor eventual implementation of the adaptation actions.   \n \n15.  Output 4 will be achieved by designing climate change adaptation pilot projects to allow \neventual upscaling and replication of study outcomes in other provinces or sectors within the \nMekong Delta region. This output will also facilitate the Government\u2019s participation in existing \nregional climate change advisory and information sharing bodies, thus allowing lessons learned \nfrom the study to be disseminated both internationally and nationally.5 \n \n16.  Institutional strengthening activities under output 5 will be completed under part B with \nthe  objective  of  building  the  skills  of  technical  staff  and  raising  awareness  among  senior \ndecision makers.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  Total cost of the TA is expected to be $1,630,000 equivalent, of which (i) $800,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia,6 and administered by ADB; and (ii) \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund.7 The Government will \nfinance the remaining $330,000 in kind, covering the costs of office accommodation, transport, \nutilities, remuneration for counterpart staff, as well as training and workshop facilities. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Department of Meteo-Hydrology and Climate Change within MONRE will be the \nexecuting agency. The provincial people\u2019s committees of Ca Mau and Kien Giang will be \nimplementing agencies for the activities at provincial level. There will be established within each \n                                                 \n4  \"No-regrets\" adaptation interventions, meaning actions that generate net social benefits under all future scenarios \nof climate change and impacts. \n5  Examples of forums include the Greater Mekong Subregion Working Group on Environment, the Mekong River \nCommission Climate Change Adaptation Initiative, Delta Research and Global Observation Network (DRAGON) \ninstitute at Can Tho University, and the Mekong Delta Forum supported by World Wide Fund for Nature.  \n6  Through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) between the \nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Asian Development Bank. \n7  Established by ADB. \n ", "    5\nprovince  a  steering  committee  (chaired  by  the  vice-chairperson  of  the  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittee and with the deputy director of DONRE as vice-chair) and a project management unit \n(headed by the deputy director of DONRE and composed of technical staff from the relevant \ndepartments).  \n \n19.  Regional activities at sectoral level will be carried out by a regional sector technical \nworking  group  chaired  by  the  Department  of  Meteo-Hydrology  and  Climate  Change.  The \nworking  group  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  guiding  study  activities  related  to  regional  sector \nanalyses; (ii) providing technical inputs; (iii) sharing information, collaborating on study progress \nand outcomes, and liaising with senior decision makers and technical staff within relevant \nministries  and  agencies;  (iv)  reviewing  study  outputs  and  contributing  to  evaluation  and \nprioritization of regional sector adaptation options; and (v) disseminating study findings and \nrecommendations to senior decision makers and technical staff. The working group will involve \nrepresentatives of the Ministry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of \nIndustry and Trade, Viet Nam Electricity, and Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. \nThe national level NTP Committee, the Climate Change Working Group of the International \nSupport Group for the Environment, and the Natural Disaster Mitigation Partnership will be \nbriefed on study progress and findings.  \n \n20.  For part A, a team of six international (totaling 19.5 person-months) and seven national \n(totaling  25.5  person-months)  consultants  will  be  required.  For  part  B,  a  team  of  three \ninternational (totaling 13.5 person-months) and three national (totaling 20.5 person-months) \nconsultants  will  be  required.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of \nreference  for  the  consultant  team  are  provided  in  Appendix  3.  Any  procurement  will  be \nimplemented according to its Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All \ntraining materials developed by the consultants and office equipment purchased under the TA \nwill be transferred to the Government upon completion of the TA and thereafter will remain the \nproperty of the Government.     \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 16 months, from January 2010 to April 2011. Part A \nconsultants will start their work in January 2010, prepare an inception report within 1 month, and \nprepare a midterm report within 6 months. On this basis, part B consultants will be mobilized in \nJune 2010 and prepare an inception report within 1 month and a final report by March 2011. \nThe  time  frame  for  completion  has  been  selected  to  correspond  to  the  Government\u2019s \nsocioeconomic development planning cycle and completion of the first phase of activities under \nthe  NTP.  Tripartite  meetings  of  the  Government,  ADB,  and  the  consultants,  as  well  as \nstakeholder workshops, will be held to discuss the inception, midterm, and final reports. ADB \nwill field a review mission every 6 months during TA implementation to supervise the work of \nconsultant. Close coordination will be maintained between ADB\u2019s Viet Nam Resident Mission \nand the office of AusAID in Ha Noi to ensure timely information sharing and effective TA \nimplementation.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Viet Nam for \nthe Climate Change Impact and Adaptation Study in the Mekong Delta, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nRural and poor people  Understanding of the  Data from National  Future climatic conditions are \nin the Mekong Delta  required adaptation  Steering Committee for  not significantly different than \nregion develop physical  response in the Mekong  Flood and Storm Control  those identified from modeling \nand economic  Delta plus initial policy    scenarios.  \nresilience to future  and investment     \nclimate change and  responses    Government\u2019s existing \nvariability.       commitment to address climate \n  Identification of a  Data from National  change as a priority in national \nbaseline and measurable  Steering Committee for  development continues. \nindicators in agriculture,  Flood and Storm Control   \nenergy, and transport    Current positive trends in \nsectors     economic growth and poverty \n    reduction in Viet Nam continue. \n   \n  Risks \nScientific uncertainty implicit in \nclimate change projections \ncauses future climatic conditions \nto differ significantly from those \npredicted. \n \nCurrent scientific findings and \nprojections in relation to climate \nchange are substantially \nrevised. \nOutcome      Assumption \nSector and provincial  Agreed  climate  change  Review of plans, policies,  Consensus can be reached \nauthorities in the  adaptation  measures  programs, and/or project  among study partners on the \nMekong Delta region  integrated  into  regional  documentation in 2011  best approaches to climate \nhave developed  socioeconomic  change adaptation. \ncapacity to increase the  development plan in the   \nclimate-resilience of  two targeted provinces of  Risks \nprograms, plans,  Mekong Delta by end of  Temporal and/or political \npolicies, and/or projects  2011  constraints mean that agreed \nto guide future    adaptation measures are not \ndevelopment planning.
