The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports the development of vocational education \nand training (VET) in Viet Nam in order to help meet the growing demand for skilled workers \nand  to  support  national  economic  development.    In  2008,  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam \nconfirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Skills Enhancement Project. \nThe project preparatory technical assistance is included in the Viet Nam Country Operations \nBusiness Plan 2008\u20132010, with the ensuing loan programmed in the 2010 lending program.1 A \nfact-finding mission to Viet Nam from 5\u201312 March 2008 reached an understanding with the \nGovernment  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and outline terms of reference for the consultants. The design and \nmonitoring framework for the TA project is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  Vietnamese  economy  is  moving  rapidly  from  a  centrally  planned  to  a  market-\noriented economy, accompanied by a move from an agrarian to an industrial base. Growth has \nbeen impressive, averaging 7.5% over the last decade.2 Along with this growth, there has been \na significant change in the structure of the labor market, with a decline in employment in the \nagriculture sector (from 69% to 57%) and a substantial increase in the industrial sector (from \n11%  to  18%)  and  services  sector  (from  20%  to  25%).  Industry  has  become  the  largest \ncontributor to gross domestic product (GDP) (43%), while the share of agriculture has declined. \nMuch of Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth has been due to its integration into the world economy \nand the opening of trade through its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2007, along with \nstrong growth in foreign direct investment. A strong investment climate is needed to continue \nthis impressive growth. A ready supply of highly skilled labor is a key component in developing \nand maintaining a good investment climate.   \n \n3.  The Labor Force. The growth in industry and services is expected to intensify over the \ncoming decade, with concomitant changes in the composition of the labor force. Projections of \nGDP and future skill needs indicate that the demand for skilled labor in particular will continue to \ngrow strongly. Unskilled labor demand is expected to decrease by 2% per year, while the \ndemand for technical workers will increase at around 7% per year. By 2010, it is expected that \nskilled workers will account for 24% of those employed.3  At present, however, skilled workers \ncomprise just 13% of the labor force. Further, unemployment rates among workers are the \nlowest for skilled workers with vocational qualifications, at just 1.4% in 2003 (compared with \n3.7% for graduates). The demand for skilled labor is most pronounced in foreign and state-\nowned  enterprises;  in  sectors  such  as  electricity,  gas,  and  water;  in  construction  and \nmanufacturing; in the export-oriented sector; and in large urban centers. As a result of the \nsubstantial increase in foreign direct investment, by 2006 foreign-owned enterprises accounted \nfor almost 100% of enterprises in oil and gas, 85% in automobile processing and 45% in \nelectronics.  They  are  also  prominent  in  manufacturing  and  fisheries.  This  is  significant  as \nforeign-owned enterprises generally employ a greater share of highly skilled labor than do \ndomestic enterprises.4   \n                                                 \n1  The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 April 2008. \n2  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program 2007\u20132010: Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Manila. \n3  Nguyen Lan Huong, Nguyen Thi Lan, and Pham Minsh Thu. 2006. Estimation of Skill Requirements for Economic \nGrowth and Employment in Period 2006\u20132010. Hanoi. Quoted in World Bank, 2007. Vietnam: Higher Education \nand Skills for Growth. Washington, DC.  \n4  World Bank. 2007. \n ", "2   \n4.  Skills Shortages. Various indicators are used to assess the nature and extent of skilled \nlabor bottlenecks: employers\u2019 perceptions of skilled labor deficiencies, job vacancies, and the \ndifficulties employers face in recruitment. Annual surveys carried out by the Ministry of Labor, \nInvalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) indicate that up to 40% of manufacturing and export-\noriented firms, including state-owned enterprises, identify the lack of skilled labor as a moderate \nor severe constraint to further expansion.5  An analysis of job vacancies in 2005 indicated that \nby far the  strongest demand for  workers across the economy  was for craftsmen (66% of \nvacancies), especially in extractive and processing industries and construction. Vacancies for \nmanagers and highly skilled technical workers made up only 7% of vacancies. In examining \nrecruitment patterns, the surveys found that almost 25% of firms indicated they found it difficult \nto recruit skilled workers.  \n \n5.  Poor quality skills and relevance of skills are a separate issue. Economic development \nrequires a skilled, creative, flexible workforce that can adapt to changes in economic activity and \ntechnology.  Employers  consider  that  the  graduates  of  VET  institutions  have  adequate \ntheoretical skills, but lack good practical and other work-related skills such as personal drive, \ninitiative, and teamwork. Consequently, university graduates are often hired to fill skilled worker \npositions, especially in the services sector. Even graduates, however, are rated deficient in \npractical technology skills and generic workplace skills by 40% of firms.  \n \n6.  These analyses indicate that skilled workers at the higher skill levels are the major need \nin the labor force. A VET system that can deliver the workers needed in a competitive market \neconomy will be critical for continued, strong economic growth. However, there is general \nagreement that the current VET system is unable to produce enough skilled labor at the higher \nlevels. Although it has expanded recently and improved in quality as a result of better quality \nassurance, the quality and relevance of training, especially practical training, also needs further \nimprovement to meet the required standards.  \n \n7.  The Policy Context. A new legal framework for VET was established in late 2006, \nthrough the Law on Vocational Training (76/2006/QH11). This law, and subsequent decrees, \nhave  given  MOLISA,  through  the  General  Department  of  Vocational  Training  (GDVT),  the \nresponsibility for coordination and management of all VET.6 The policies articulated in the Law \nsupport (i) investment in an expanded  network to meet the demand for VET; (ii) investment to \nimprove VET quality including curricula, trainers, and VET institutions; (iii) encouragement of \nnational and foreign entities to set up VET institutions and participate in VET activities; (iv) \npopularizing  of  vocational  jobs  among  youth;  and  (v)  training  of  workers  for  overseas \nemployment. In a further important structural change, the Law mandates the introduction of a \nnew vocational college level to meet the need for more highly skilled workers, consisting of a 2-\nyear post-secondary diploma course. The Ministry of Planning and Investment has recently \ndrafted a 2020 strategy for human resource development that includes VET.   \n  \n8.  Recent Expansion of the VET System. Over the last 5 years, the number of vocational \nschools for long-term training at secondary level increased by 68% (to 200) and the number of \ntraining centers for short-term basic skills training increased by 300% (to 650). Graduate output \nhas increased at an average rate of 6.5% per year, with long-term VET reaching 1.15 million \npeople in 2007 (average increase 15% per year), and short-term training reaching 5.46 million \n(average increase 6% per year). Nevertheless, the VET system cannot respond fully to the \nrising quality and quantity requirements of industry. In 2007, only 26% of the VET graduates \n                                                 \n5  MOLISA. Annual surveys that cover a sample of 664 large enterprises across all industries. \n6 Technical education is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Training. \n ", "  3 \ncame from the secondary or diploma level. To increase the output of highly skilled workers, the \nGovernment plans to establish 250 vocational colleges by 2020, as well as 300 secondary \nvocational schools. Development will focus initially on a network of 100 model institutions in key \neconomic sectors and industrial zones, including 35 that will be designed specifically to meet \ninternational standards in high-demand sectors.  \n \n9.  Mismatch Between Labor Market Demand and Training Provision. In line with this \npolicy, the Government will change the balance in training provision by moving away from the \ncurrent  focus  on low-level  service skills  and  increasing  higher  level training.  Diploma-level \ntraining  provision  will  be  increased  to  15%  by  2020,  intermediate-level  provision  will  be \nincreased from 23% to 35%, and basic skills training will be reduced to 50%. The time devoted \nto practical skills training will also be expanded. The introduction of vocational colleges to \naccommodate the diploma level is the most important innovation in the drive to produce highly \nskilled workers who are responsive to the requirements of modern enterprises.  \n \n10.  Low Demand Orientation. There is limited involvement of industry in the planning and \ndevelopment of the VET system at the national level. This stems partly from the lack of a \nsuitable mechanism for coordination, and also from long-established modes of operating among \ngovernment officials and the private sector. The absence of a reliable labor market information \nsystem  that  can  accurately  project  labor  market  demand  and  skills  shortages  is  a  further \nlimitation that hampers the responsiveness of the VET system. Although a start has been made \nto establish such systems, they have not been properly institutionalized. \n \n11.  Weak School Management. The VET system remains largely supply driven. Numbers \nof students and fields of study at the institutional level are determined through a quota system. \nThis  weakens  the  incentives  and  desire  among  school  managers  to  become  more \nentrepreneurial by, for  example, initiating links with local enterprises and reorienting study \nprograms to fit local demand. The lack of autonomy given to school managers in planning, \ncurriculum and financing decisions inhibits a more dynamic approach to school management. \n \n12.  Limited  Private  Provision.  The  Government  is  encouraging  the  private  sector  to \nestablish training institutions, to help meet the need for skilled workers. To this end, public \nsubsidies  to  public  institutions  are  being  reduced  gradually,  with  institutions  themselves \nexpected to finance the gap from income and student fees. So far, the development of private \n(or nonpublic) provision has been slow; only 8 out of the 70 new vocational colleges and 29 out \nof  the  200  vocational  schools  are  nonpublic.  However,  some  of  the  nonpublic  schools, \nespecially those owned by state-owned enterprises, work closely with industry and have been \nvery successful. Private sector investment can be difficult to harness, however, because VET is \ncostly and does not yield immediate benefits. The Government therefore needs to develop \npolicies and incentives to encourage the development of private institutions.  \n \n13.  Lessons. ADB\u2014together with the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, and the Nordic Development Fund\u2014has supported MOLISA \nin implementing the Vocational and Technical Education Project,7 which closed on 31 March \n2008. The project successfully established 15 VET schools, developed skills standards for 48 \noccupations, piloted labor force and education information systems, introduced an accreditation \nsystem, and piloted a national testing and certification program within MOLISA. The project \ndemonstrated  the  need  for  (i)  better  coordination  and  management  of  VET  and  greater \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1998.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The TA will design a project for enhancing vocational skills training to better respond to \nthe demand for skilled workers in key industries in the industrial and service sectors. The impact \nof the TA project will be a VET system that offers higher level skills training with stronger private \nsector participation for key occupations. The outcome of the TA project will be an agreed design \nfor a loan project. The main outputs will be (i) an assessment of current sector outputs and their \nrelevance to the labor market, (ii) identification of critical issues in upgrading skills training levels, \n(iii)  a  long-term  strategy  to  improve  training  of  skilled  workers  though  better  subsector \nmanagement and training quality, and expanded output, (iv) a project outline that addresses key \nconstraints and projected labor market needs, and (v) a detailed project design. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n15.  The proposed project will support implementation of the new Law on Vocational Training \nthrough (i) support for stronger subsector management and industry links; (ii) improved program \nand training quality; (iii) the establishment of 20\u201330 high-performing colleges; and (iv) stronger \ninvolvement of the private sector in the planning, development, and implementation of skills \nstandards, program identification, and funding of VET. The medium-term strategy developed by \nthe  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  will  be  updated.  The  project  will  build  on  the \nachievements of the Vocational and Technical Education Project, in particular the work done in \ndeveloping skills standards, accreditation and certification mechanisms, school\u2013industry links, \nand management information systems. The TA project will complement the activities of other \ndonors including the German Technical Cooperation, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), the \nInternational  Labour  Organization,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  the \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea. There will also be extensive consultation with industry and \nbusiness on mechanisms for linking the VET system and the private sector more effectively. \n \n16.  The TA project will (i) examine the systems for policy development and planning in order \nto strengthen the links of the VET system with industry, (ii) conduct sector and labor market \nassessments and review Government policy and plans for the sector, (iii) develop a long-term \nstrategy based on the above assessment and the draft strategy developed by the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment, (iv) propose a list of key occupations to be covered by the proposed \nproject, (v) define the selection criteria for project institutions and propose a \u201clong list,\u201d (vi) \nassess the implementation of skills standards in VET institutions and links with local industry \nand employers, (vii) develop a generic program that will allow vocational colleges to meet \nregional  and  international  standards,  (viii)  coordinate  with  other  donors  to  ensure  the \neffectiveness of the proposed project, and (ix) prepare a detailed project design.  \n \n17.  Assumptions and Risks. The successful implementation of the TA project is based on \nthe premise that Viet Nam\u2019s economy will continue to expand and support the employment of \nincreasing numbers of highly skilled workers, and that industry involvement will be encouraged \nand will be effective. There is a risk that college directors may oppose new approaches to \nfunding, management, and program delivery, so workshops will be held throughout the TA \nproject to explain the advantages. The TA project also assumes that agreement can be reached \nwith MOLISA and stakeholders on a more representative organizational structure for managing \n ", "  5 \nVET, and this will require extensive consultation and negotiation. The successful completion of \nthe TA outputs requires data on the labor force and future labor market needs. Available data is \nlimited in scope and quality but will be sufficient for the purpose. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The  cost  of  the  TA  project  is  estimated  at  $750,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide \n$600,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The remaining $150,000 will be contributed by the Government and will \ninclude office accommodation, utilities, remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, and \nadministrative support. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA project does \nnot commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 3. \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  MOLISA will be the Executing Agency, and GDVT will be the Implementing Agency. \nGDVT will establish a unit for the implementation of the TA project. Selected line ministries and \nlocal departments of MOLISA will be the counterparts of this implementing unit. The donor \nworking group recently established within MOLISA to ensure a coordinated approach to the \ndevelopment of VET, and chaired by the minister, will provide technical advice. \n \n20.  An international consulting firm will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The selection and engagement of \nthe international consulting firm will be through the quality- and cost-based selection method \nusing a simplified technical proposal and standard quality-cost ratio of 80:20. The TA will \nprovide eight international consultants (19 person-months) and nine national consultants (29 \nperson-months). Funds of $18,000 will remain unallocated for individual consultants, to be \nidentified as needed. The consultant terms of reference are in Appendix 4. All TA-financed \ngoods will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). All equipment will be transferred to the Government after TA completion. \n \n21.  The TA project will be carried out in two phases over 9 months, beginning mid-August \n2008. During the first phase, the consultants will carry out initial assessments of the sector, \nlabor  market  needs,  the  labor  market  and  education  information  systems,  organizational \narrangements  for  the management  of  VET,  and  the  institutional capacity  of  GDVT  as  the \nexecuting agency. The consultants will also agree with the Government on a draft design and \nmonitoring framework and project outline. In the second phase the consultants will finalize the \ndetailed design of the project. The consultant team will submit the following reports: (i) an \ninception report and an implementation plan; (ii) a sector assessment and problem-tree analysis; \n(iii) a midterm report, including an outline project proposal and long-term sector strategy; (iv) a \ndraft TA final report and investment report; and (v) a final report. The TA project completion date \nwill be 31 May 2009. \n \nIII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the Skills Enhancement Project, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nand/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nHigher level skills  \u2022 A new organizational  \u2022 Annual reports from the  \u2022 The demand for more and \ntraining with stronger  structure for the  education management  better skilled workers in \nprivate sector  management of VET  information system  the occupations identified \nparticipation in the  established.  \u2022 Annual reports from the  continues to expand \nvocational and \n\u2022 More comprehensive and  labor market information  \u2022 Industry involvement will \neducation training \nmore current education  system  be welcomed and will be \n(VET) system for key \nand labor market data is  \u2022 Decree issued by  effective \noccupations. \navailable to determine  minister, MOLISA to   \noccupational target areas.  establish new  Risk \n\u2022 A network of VET  organizational structure \n\u2022 The management of \ncolleges is developed for  \u2022 Individual annual college  MOLISA and VET colleges \nskilled worker training,  reports  may oppose new \nwith private sector \napproaches to funding, \ninvolvement and support. \nmanagement, and \n\u2022 Colleges use industry skill  program delivery \nstandards for certification \nand assessment. \n\u2022 College course offerings \nare planned in partnership \nwith the private sector. \nOutcome      Assumption \nAn agreed design for a  \u2022 Project design is agreed  \u2022 TA project final report   \u2022 MOLISA and local training \nloan project.  by the Government of Viet  \u2022 Investment report   authorities support moving \nNam and ADB.   to a demand-driven VET \n\u2022 TA project final report and  system \ninvestment report   \napproved. \nOutputs        Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of \nthe partner country. \nThe Government of Viet Nam strongly supports the development of vocational training as part of its strategy to promote \neconomic growth and development. The need to actively develop vocational training\u2014including schools, vocational \ncolleges,  and  teacher  training  institutions  for  technical  teachers\u2014is  emphasized  in The  Five-Year  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan 2006\u20132010. Domestic and international firms have identified the lack of well-qualified skilled labor as \none of three key bottlenecks hampering the development of a strong investment climate necessary to encourage firms to \ninvest, innovate, and grow. In turn, this will create new jobs in the economy. As vocational training is generally the choice \nof the less well-off, it can be expected that possession of high-quality skills in a relevant trade or business sector will \ncontribute indirectly to reducing poverty.  \nB.  Targeting Classification  \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nThe project will contribute to poverty reduction indirectly through helping skilled workers to find more and better paid \nemployment in industry and business.  \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.    If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \nA social development specialist will be recruited for the technical assistance (TA), and a social development specialist from \nADB will be a team member. \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross-subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n  The project beneficiaries are generally poor as the better-off tend not to enter vocational training if they have other \noptions. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \nThe potential beneficiaries are vocational education trainees, who are generally not well-off. \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nMore relevant vocational training that is more closely linked to labor market demands, thereby furnishing them with the skills \nto get a better paid job. \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \nPotential constraints include (i) possible difficulties in strengthening the public\u2013private partnerships in vocational education \nand training (VET) arising from the possible unwillingness of government to relinquish sole control over the planning, \nmanagement, and financing of the sector; and (ii) the possible unwillingness of private enterprises to become more involved, \nwhich will require them to give more time and resources. Stakeholders\u2019 consultations, with particular emphasis on involving \nprivate enterprise and emphasizing the mutual benefits of such a partnership, will be held throughout the TA project.  \n   \n ", "1  0  Appendix 2 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \nMinistry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs; Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry; other national chambers of \ncommerce (e.g., United States, Australia, and Japan); representatives of state-owned enterprises; individual representatives \nof major employers from foreign-owned companies; school principals; trainers; trainees; and other government departments \nwhich manage vocational training institutions. \n2. What type of consultation and participation is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, community \nmobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \nExtensive meetings and consultations will be held with the above stakeholders throughout the TA project, as well as initial, \nmidterm, and final national workshops. \n3. What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4. Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \nConsultation with major stakeholders will take place regularly throughout the TA project. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or program? \nGirls are relatively well represented in vocational training in general (around 40% of trainees), but are less well represented in \ntechnical training, especially in manufacturing and the trades areas. \n \n2. Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \nThe proposed project can help promote greater participation of women in these fields, and identify new opportunities for \ngirls in emerging fields. A gender plan will be prepared during the TA project. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nGiven the serious shortage of skilled labor, it is unlikely that women will lose training and employment opportunities to men. \n \nIII.
