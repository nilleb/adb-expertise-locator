INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Credible and transparent financial reporting and management has the potential to improve \ndecision-making in the public sector, and helps governments be more accountable to their citizens \nand other stakeholders. This regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) seeks to \nenhance the awareness and capacity of government officials in developing member countries \n(DMCs) on International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and practices to improve \ntheir financial reporting.1 It is also designed to achieve one of the key objectives of Strategy 2020: \nregional cooperation and integration through its development agenda on good governance and \nstrengthened knowledge on DMCs.2 \n \n2.  The International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) is a standards-\nsetting body designated by and operating under the International Federation of Accountants.3 \nOne of the IPSASB\u2019s main functions is to develop high-quality international financial reporting \nstandards for the public sector, with the long-term strategic objective of increasing the adoption \nof accrual-basis IPSAS. Accrual-basis IPSAS will strengthen and improve the transparency of a \ngovernment\u2019s financial reporting and management, resulting in a more comprehensive and \naccurate view of its financial position. \n \n3.  Since 1997, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the IPSASB\u2019s \nstandard-setting program on developing accounting standards for the public sector through \nregional and policy TA on Public Sector Accounting Standards.4 ADB\u2019s Controller\u2019s Department \n(CTL) has been participating in the IPSASB forums and task forces that review some of the \nIPSAS. The IPSASB emphasizes the need for more outreach programs that will support DMC \ncapacity building for the adoption of IPSAS and the improvement of their overall financial reporting \nand management frameworks. This TA aims to complement the policy and advisory TA and help \nthe DMCs formulate plans to improve their government accounting frameworks, standard-setting \nprocesses, information technology systems, and capacity building programs for government \nofficials. \n \n4.  This TA is not included in ADB\u2019s current country operations business plans or in the CTL\u2019s \nmanagement-approved annual work program.5 As such, the CTL sought the approval of the Vice-\nPresident for finance and risk management for the TA concept paper. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Although the DMCs recognize the benefits and importance of accrual-basis IPSAS, most \ndo not yet have robust accounting standards and systems for financial reporting. They still follow \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on 20 \nNovember 2017. \n2  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n3  The International Federation of Accountants is the global organization for the accountancy profession dedicated to \nserving the public interest by strengthening the profession and contributing to the development of strong international \neconomies. It has more than 175 members and associates in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. \n4  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance for Government Accounting Standards.

Common constraints include the \nlack of well-trained government officials in accrual accounting and IPSAS, the lack of appropriate \nfinancial management information systems, and the multiyear timeframes and financial resources \nrequired for implementation. \n \n6.  In response to the DMCs\u2019 capacity constraints and needs, ADB provided the first phase \nof capacity development TA to enhance the public sector accounting capacity of DMC government \nofficials and promote knowledge sharing.6 Under this TA, ADB conducted two regional forums \nand  two  regional  workshops  on  public  sector  accounting  during  2013-2016,  attended  by \ngovernment  officials  from  selected  DMCs.  Resource  speakers  from  the  IPSASB,  several \ninternational institutions, governments, and professional institutions shared (i) developments in \nIPSAS and global best accounting practices, and (ii) challenges and experiences in implementing \naccrual-basis accounting. The forums and workshops also included extensive discussions on the \nexperience of various countries in implementing financial management reforms, and reiterated \nthe  importance  of  political  commitments  from  government  leaders,  detailed  research  and \nplanning, capacity development of government officials, and the development of a sound financial \nmanagement information system. The feedback from forum and workshop participants was very \npositive. These events helped to develop a community of practitioners to share knowledge on and \ngain insights into public sector accounting. The participants expressed strong support for the \ncontinuation of such forums and workshops, and suggested the inclusion of specific topics \nrelevant to the challenges that they face. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  the  awareness  and  capacity  of  DMC \ngovernment officials enhanced on IPSAS and international accounting practices to improve their \nfinancial reporting and management. The TA will have the following outcome: knowledge and \nunderstanding of accrual-basis IPSAS and global best accounting practices that lead to improved \ntransparency and accountability in DMCs\u2019 public sector financial reporting and management \nstrengthened.7 The TA is expected to provide a venue for knowledge sharing and cross-border \ninteraction that will support collaborative capacity development and enable DMC officials to \nincrease their awareness and understanding of public sector accounting practices. \n \nB.  Output, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Regional knowledge-sharing forum events on public sector accounting \ndelivered. Participants in phase 1 of the Regional Forum on Public Sector Accounting underlined \nthe challenges of improving public sector accounting, as several experiences have shown that \nadopting accrual-basis IPSAS is a long-term initiative. To respond to this challenge, phase 2 of \nthe Regional Forum of Public Sector Accounting proposes to help the DMCs further strengthen \ntheir government accounting and reporting frameworks. It is vital to keep government officials \ncontinuously updated on the benefits of and latest trends in accrual-basis IPSAS to improve public \nsector accounting. ADB will organize at least two regional accounting forums to continue (i) \ndeveloping DMCs\u2019 technical and implementing capacity with regard to accrual-basis IPSAS, and \n(ii) establishing a platform for the exchange of knowledge and experiences. \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance for Regional Forum on Public Sector Accounting. Manila (TA 7903-REG). \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \n \n9.  To  promote  the  sharing  of  knowledge  and  experiences  to  a  larger  audience  and \nstrengthen regional collaboration and networking further, ADB will invite participants from more \nDMCs and regions to attend the forums. The forums will allow participants to gain a better \nunderstanding of current developments in IPSAS and global best accounting practices from \ninternationally recognized resource speakers, and will help participants develop road maps for \nstrengthening government accounting frameworks. The DMCs are also expected to share their \nown experiences, including benefits and challenges, in moving toward accrual-basis IPSAS or \nsimilar national standards. DMCs with less developed financial reporting practices will gain \nknowledge from countries with more robust accounting frameworks and information technology \nsystems. The forums will include diverse topics and breakout sessions to interest and meet the \nneeds of DMCs with different accounting frameworks. Furthermore, the forums will address \nDMCs\u2019 concerns and challenges raised during phase 1 of the regional forum. \n \n10.  Discussion topics at the forums will include the following: \n(i)  the benefits and challenges of adopting IPSAS and accrual accounting; \n(ii)  road maps for adopting accrual-basis IPSAS; \n(iii)  financial management information systems; \n(iv)  technical training and the application of IPSAS; and \n(v)  specific  targeted  topics,  such  as  the  consolidation  of  government  financial \nreporting, fixed asset accounting, and internal control and risk management. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $250,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA, and the CTL will be the implementing agency. A team of CTL \nstaff  will  oversee  the  logistical  and  administrative  requirements  of  the  forums,  such  as \ncoordinating with the forum venues and arranging the accommodation and flights of forum \nparticipants. ADB will engage a national consultant as a coordinator for each forum if the CTL \ndetermines that additional resources are required.8 The CTL will implement the TA in consultation \nwith  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  and  Operations  Services  and  Financial  Management \nDepartment, and will follow the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach.9 \n \n13.  Consulting services. ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions.10 ADB will engage subject experts from the IPSASB, accounting professional \ninstitutions,  governments,  and  ADB  and  other  multilateral  development  banks  as  resource \nspeakers for the forums. \n \n                                                \n8  One national consultant (about 3 person-months) for each forum, totaling 6 person-months. \n9  The Action Plan for the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 calls for the promotion of a \u201cOne ADB\u201d culture to consolidate \nand strengthen the delivery of knowledge work and services.

The TA will be implemented from January 2018 to December 2020 and will include at least \ntwo forums. ADB may consider additional forums depending on the DMCs\u2019 needs, timeframes, \nand availability of resources. \n \n15.  Forum participants will consist of senior officials, nominated by the governments of the \nDMCs, who are responsible for public sector accounting. Each forum will have about 40\u201350 \nparticipants from all regions and is expected to be held over 2 days. The forum venues will be \ndecided based on logistical and cost considerations. \n \n16.
