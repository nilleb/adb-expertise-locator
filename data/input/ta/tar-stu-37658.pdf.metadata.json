The Pacific islands recognize the importance of promoting economic growth by fostering \nan  economic,  political,  and  legal  environment  that  is  conducive  to  domestic  and  foreign \ninvestment, particularly the role of commercial laws and sound dispute resolution processes in \nfacilitating investment and growth of the private sector.1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB)  \nrecently completed a regional private sector assessment (PSA)2 for Pacific developing member \ncountries  (PDMCs).  The  PSA  concluded  that  PDMCs\u2019  financial  markets  do  not  mediate \neffectively between savers and investors; the weak institutions associated with collateralizing \nand  collecting  debts  exclude  many  from  the  financial  system.  Accordingly,  improving  the \nenvironment  for  private  sector  development  (PSD)  through  more  efficient  financial \nintermediation by enhancing the security and transferability of property rights was included as a \nkey result area in the draft ADB Pacific strategy for 2005\u20132009. \n \n2.  The regional technical assistance (TA)3 is designed to support PSD in selected PDMCs \nin line with ADB\u2019s PSD Strategy.4  A similar TA was successfully completed for Vanuatu in \nMarch 2004,5 and the lessons learned have contributed to the design of this regional TA. The \nTA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.   The financial sectors of PDMCs are underdeveloped and financial intermediation is \nlimited. Banking services seldom reach beyond the main urban areas and have little outreach to \nlow-income households and indigenous entrepreneurs involved in such activities as agriculture \nand fishing. Lending occurs only where it is possible to obtain collateral, but the systems for \nusing  property  as  collateral  are  cumbersome,  expensive,  and  often  unavailable.  The \nunderdevelopment of the financial sector is, among other factors, mainly connected to two \nimportant and related issues: (i) adverse implications of the customary land tenure system and \n(ii) lack of an effective secured transactions framework.6 Land rights and the difficulty in using \nland as collateral for loans in the Pacific are contentious issues with deep-seated cultural \nimplications requiring time and resources to solve.7 To deepen financial markets and improve \nfinancial intermediation, the ability to effectively use movable property (chattel) as collateral will \nbe  crucial  to  facilitate  lending.8  A  well-functioning  secured  transactions  system  generates \neconomic  and  social  gains  for  creditors  and  debtors  as  it  reduces  transaction  costs  and \nimproves  access  to  credit.  It  effectively  links  savers  and  investors,  and  enhances  credit \nintermediation. Broadly, the more and better the collateral offered by the borrower, the lower the \ninterest rate, the longer the time to repay, and the larger the loan relative to income. \n                                                 \n1  Forum Economic Action Plan, Pacific Islands Forum Economic Ministers meeting, Majuro, MarshalI Islands, 11\u201312 \nJune 2003. \n2  ADB. 2003.

Collateral Without \nConsequence: Some Causes and Effects of Financial Underdevelopment in Latin America. The Financier, Vol 4.  \n ", "2  \n4.  Financial  markets  in  the  Pacific  region  are  not  effective  in  supplying  capital  to \nenterprises and are biased against smaller enterprises, sole proprietorships, rural business, and \nthe ability of indigenous people to finance their investments and businesses. This situation \nappears not to be the result of the unwillingness of most financial institutions in the region to \nengage in business financing, but a function of perceived high risk resulting from the lack of \neffective use of collateral. Through the creation of a security interest,9 a lender can be granted \nundisputed priority in collecting against certain property of the borrower (secured interest), with \na legal system that permits the secured party to recover and sell the property in a timely \nmanner. To deepen financial intermediation, PDMCs face the challenge to (i) legally define \nrights in both fixed and movable property; (ii) simplify procedures for identifying claims against \nmovable property; (iii) implement procedures for repossessing pledged property in the event of \ndefault that remove the requirements for obtaining judgments through the courts; (iv) improve \nenforcement; and (v) develop and implement an effective registration system. A well-functioning \nsecured transactions system would permit farmers, consumers, and businesses to use movable \nproperty as collateral for loans and thus generate economic and social gains for creditors and \ndebtors, reduce transactions costs, and improve access to credit. \n \n5.  Experience in other countries has shown some lessons on how to achieve successful \nsecured transactions reforms.10 One lesson is that an effective secured transactions framework \nshould embody several key elements, the most important of which are the following: \n \n(i)  Creation. The process by which the creditor establishes a security interest in \nproperty (the collateral) must allow for the use of all economically important \nproperty, transactions, and agents. In addition, the law must permit creation at a \nlow cost relative to the value of the transaction.  \n(ii)  Priority. The process that establishes the order in which claims against the \ncollateral will be paid must set out clear rules for ranking the security interest \nagainst all other claims against the collateral. In so doing, it must provide rules \nfor unambiguous ranking of priority and protect the secured party from hidden \nclaims of third parties, including other secured creditors, unsecured creditors, a \ntrustee  in  bankruptcy,  some  purchasers  of  the  collateral,  labor  claims,  and \ngovernment tax claims. \n(iii)  Publicity (registration). The process that the law specifies to make public the \nranking  of  priority  of  the  security  interest  must  permit  a  potential  lender  to \nestablish a ranking of priority against the collateral by filing a notice of security \ninterest in a publicly available, preferably web-based, filing archive. It must also \npermit a potential lender to easily search the archive to determine whether other \nclaims  exist  against  a  borrower's  property.  The  process  must  be  fast  and \naffordable. \n(iv)  Enforcement.  This  is  the  process  by  which,  upon  the  debtor's  default,  the \ncreditor can seize collateral or evict tenants in cases where real estate leases \nhave been pledged as collateral. Once collateral is seized, it must be simple to \nsell it to pay off the debt. Such sale must take place  quickly relative to the \neconomic life of the property, and cost little in relation to the value of the \ntransaction secured with such property. \n                                                 \n9  A claim on property as collateral for loans. \n10 For example, the United States of America, most Canadian provinces, and Romania have adopted a low-cost, self-\nsustainable notice filing system. Creditors obtain information directly from the database where security interests are \nelectronically filed. \n ", "  3\n6.  This TA will draw on lessons learned and international best practice. Four PDMCs that \nhad been invited to take part\u2014Fiji Islands, Papua New Guinea, Marshall Islands, and Solomon \nIslands\u2014have confirmed their participation. The TA will include a diagnostic review of the \nunderlying  issues  in  each  country,  as  well  as  recommendations  for  the  design  and \nimplementation of the envisaged reforms for a secured transactions framework and system. \nSubject to continued strong government support, the TA will subsequently lead to a series of \ncountry-specific follow-on TAs, which will implement the TA recommendations of the regional \nTA and promulgate an effective secured transactions system. This has already been foreseen in \nthe Country Strategy Program Updates for Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands. \n \n7.  Building on existing PSD-related economic and sector work undertaken by ADB and \nothers [four individual PSAs for Marshall Islands (May 2003), Papua New Guinea (June 2003), \nSamoa (May 2003), Vanuatu (May 2003)] in the Pacific islands, the TA will also provide focused \nanalytical work on selected issues related to financial sector and legal and regulatory reforms, if \nestablishing an enabling environment for enhanced financial intermediation is deemed relevant. \nThese outputs will\u2014to the extent possible\u2014be linked to existing or prospective ADB assistance \nactivities in PDMCs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The purpose of this TA is to design and agree with Government on a sound secured \ntransaction reform package in each participating PDMC and prepare them for implementation \nwith the ultimate goal of improving the access of the private sector to affordable credit. The \nregional  TA  is  designed  to  leverage  the  country-specific  TA  program.  It  will  have  two \ncomponents. \n \n9.  The first component aims to produce a sound road map for establishing a legal and \nregulatory framework for secured transactions in each of the four participating PDMCs. It will \nhave the following outputs: (i) diagnostic review of the existing legal, regulatory, and institutional \nframework for security interests; (ii) recommendations for establishing a registration system or \nfiling archive for security interests, including its design, establishment, location, and operation; \nand (iii) confidence building among stakeholders. \n \n10.  The second component will produce assessments of selected financial sector issues. \nFlexibility will be required, so as to be able to respond on an as-needed basis as relevant issues \narise.  PDMCs  participating  in  this  component  will  not  necessarily  be  identical  with  those \nselected for component 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The  diagnostic  studies  for  secured  transactions  (component  1)  will:  (i)  prepare  an \noverview of the existing legal and regulatory framework for security interests; (ii) identify  policy \nissues in creating, prioritizing, publicizing, and enforcing secured interests, and make related \nrecommendations for the implementation phase; (iii) pin point institutional considerations in \nestablishing, locating and operating the registration system or filing archive, and recommend \nhow the system should be structured; (iv) prepare a medium-term action plan for developing an \ninclusive secured transactions system, including required investment and capacity building \nactivities; (v) identify and assess associated areas that require reforms and could be added to a \ncomprehensive reform package in support of improving access to affordable credit; (vi) set out a \n ", "4  \nreform road map for secured transactions projects in each country specifying the necessary \nsteps to introduce an effective system of pledging movable property as collateral, with details on \nlinkages and sequencing of reform components; (vii) address as necessary, PSA and financial \nsector  assessment  related  to  financial  intermediation;  and  (viii)  present  the  findings  and \nsuggestions for reform to senior government officials, legal practitioners, lending institutions, \nand private sector representatives in each of the studied countries. \n \n12.  Assessments of selected financial sector issues (component 2) on an as-needed basis \nwill complement the activities under component 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $870,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. Detailed cost \nestimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The  Pacific  Department,  ADB,  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  For  the \ndiagnostic studies for secured transactions (component 1), each participating government will \nappoint a senior official, acceptable to ADB, as project director  to manage the day-to-day \nactivities of the TA and coordinate with other agencies and concerned parties through a \ncommittee of stakeholders comprising government, legal practitioners, and representatives from \nlending  institutions.  Each  participating  government  will  provide  logistical  support  to  the \nconsultants by providing necessary data and facilitating consultations. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over about 24 months. It is expected to start in November \n2004, with completion in November 2006. Under component 1, the TA will require for each \nstudy country (i)  international private sector development specialist (2 person-months), (ii)  \ninternational secured transactions specialist (2 person-months), and (iii) a domestic legal expert \n(1.5 person-months). Component 1 will therefore require international consulting services of 24 \nperson-months to be recruited through a consulting firm. Under component 2, 8 person-months \nwill be required for financial sector assessments, to be undertaken by individual consultants. All \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and by quality-and cost-based selection and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The team leader of component 1 will submit to ADB a concise inception report shortly \nafter the first visit to each participating country, and the draft final report after 14 months of \nimplementation. As appropriate, the team leader will return to each country to present and \ndiscuss the draft final report with the respective governments and stakeholders. The final report, \nincorporating comments received, will be submitted to ADB and the governments involved \nwithin 17 months of the start of the TA. The consultant will submit three copies each of the draft \nfinal and final reports to ADB and six to each government. The final report will also be submitted \non CD-ROM. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $870,000 on a grant basis for \nDiagnostic Studies for Secured Transactions Reforms in the Pacific Region, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n ", "    Appendix 1  5\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal       \n       \nImproved access of the  Increased credit to  National gazettes, economic   \nprivate sector to  private sector as % of  and financial sector reports, \naffordable credit in  Gross Domestic Product  private sector assessments \nPacific developing   \nmember countries  Reduced interest rate \n(PDMCs)  spreads \n   \nLower transaction cost \nfor credit provision \nPurpose       \n       \nFormulate sound secured  An agreed upon reform  Memoranda of understanding  Continued  commitment of \ntransactions reform  road map for each  between government and  government and policy makers \npackages in participating  participating PDMC,  Asian Development Bank  to implement proposed reform \nPDMCs, and assess   setting out the design and  (ADB) on the secured  package  \nselected financial sector  implementation  transactions reform packages   \nissues in the Pacific  arrangements for the    Responsiveness of lenders and \nislands  secured transactions    borrowers to reform package \n  reform package     \nSeamless transition from \nregional technical assistance \n(TA) to country-specific follow-\non TAs for implementing the \nreform package \nOutputs       \nComponent 1:       \n1.1 Diagnostic reports  1.1 Reports accepted by  1.1 Communications between  Agreed upon reform road maps \non the existing legal,  governments and ADB,  governments and ADB, ADB  to be taken by governments and \nregulatory, and  and submitted within 18  mission reports, and  ADB for country-specific \ninstitutional framework  months of the start of the  consultant reports  implementation \nfor security interests  TA   \n     \n1.2 Diagnostic reports  1.2 Reports accepted by  1.2 Communications between \non the establishment of  governments and ADB,  governments and ADB, ADB \nan effective filing  and submitted within 18  mission reports, and \narchive (registry) for  months of the start of the  consultant reports \nsecured transactions,  TA   \nincluding its design,     \nestablishment,     \nlocation, and operation     \n     \n1.3 Confidence built  1.3.
