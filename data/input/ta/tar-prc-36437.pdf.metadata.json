During the 2004 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help the Baoding municipal \ngovernment (BMG) prepare a project\u2014Integrated Ecosystem Management and Environmental \nProtection of the Baiyangdian Lake Catchment\u2014to be financed by an ADB loan and a Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF) grant. The technical assistance (TA) was included in the PRC country \nstrategy and program for 2005. In March 2005, a Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC to hold \ndiscussions with BMG staff, and reached an understanding with the PRC Government on the \ndetailed objectives, scope, costs, implementation, and financing arrangements for the TA.1 The \nProject will support BMG in restoring and protecting the economic and environmental services of \nBaiyangdian Lake using the integrated ecosystems management approach.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Baiyangdian Lake in Hebei Province is the largest remaining semiclosed freshwater body in \nthe northern part of the PRC. The lake lies in the middle reaches of the Daiqinghe River basin2 and \nultimately discharges into the Bohai Gulf, Yellow Sea. Much of the upstream catchment totaling \n31,500 square kilometers (km2) lies within Baoding municipality and all of the lake body is located \nin  Anxin  and  Xiongxian  counties  of  Baoding.3  The  lake  has  a  surface  area  of 366  km2  and \ncomprises a series of natural low-lying depressions and reed marshes. While nine rivers and/or \nchannels flow into Baiyangdian Lake, only two have regular but decreasing flows, namely, Fuhe \nand Juma rivers. \n3.  Historically, the lake served many environmental and economic services and was described \nas the \u201ckidney\u201d of northern PRC. Because of its strategic position as a sink in the Daiqinghe River \nbasin, it is a critical floodwater retention catchment of rainfall water inflows and surface runoffs for \nabout 72% of the basin\u2019s area. Specifically, it regulates floodwater discharges and water levels, \nand  moderates  waterlogging.  It  is  likewise  a  pathway  for  transport  of  substances  especially \nnutrients that help contribute to the purification of water and the regeneration of nutrients. The lake \nis also economically important, especially for the more than 100,000 people residing on the lake\u2019s \nwetlands  and  peripheral  zones,  providing    them  with  their  main  sources  of  livelihood  (e.g. \nfreshwater fishery, reed production and tourism services), water for drinking and irrigation, and \nmajor transportation routes. The open water and aquatic beds of the lake serve as spawning \ngrounds and feeding habitats for a diverse array of fish and other animal species. As a large body \nof water, the lake also moderates the local and regional temperature and thus has an effect on the \nmicroclimate of its surroundings.  \n4.  Baiyangdian Lake and its upper watershed in the Taiheng Mountains support significant \nbiodiversity of regional and global significance within the Daiqinghe River basin. The lake and its \nassociated wetlands are primarily important as a refueling site for migratory birds on the east \nAsian-Australasian flyway. Seven globally threatened bird species are regularly sighted in the area. \nThe Taiheng Mountains, which contain most of the last remaining natural forests in Baoding, \nsupport a wide range of rare and endemic animals such as the brown-eared pheasant Crossoptilon \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 July 2003. \n2  The Daiqinghe River basin is one of the nine main river systems within the Haihe River basin. It has a total area of \n43,065 square kilometers (km2) comprising mostly Hebei Province, a small portion of Shanxi Province, and portions of \nBeijing and Tianjin municipalities. The basin can be divided into three major geographic regions: (i) Taiheng Shan \n(mountains from 500\u20132,286 meters [m] altitude), consisting of the western 40% of the basin; (ii) a low hill transition \nzone of <500 m altitude, covering 10% of the basin; and (iii) the lowland plains occupying 50% of the basin\u2019s land area. \n3  Baoding is the third largest municipality in Hebei Province, with a total area of 22,112 km2 and a population of \n10,830,000 in 2004. The municipality comprises 22 counties and 4 urban districts. Total gross domestic product of the \nmunicipality in 2004 was CNY11.1 billion. Its growth rate in recent years averaged 11% per annum, with industry as \nthe lead sector, followed by services and agriculture sectors. \n ", "2   \nmantchuricum,  grey-sided  thrush  Turdus  feae,  leopard  Panthera  pardus,  and  golden  takin \nBudorcas taxicolor. It is also recognized as a center of plant endemism in the PRC.  \n5.  In the last four decades, the functions and values of Baiyangdian Lake and its catchment \narea have been eroded. Construction of large reservoirs in the upstream catchment has led to a \ndramatic decline in water inflows and surface runoffs into the lake, from an average of 1.73 billion \ncubic meters (m3) of water discharging into the lake in the 1960s down to 0.065 billion m3 in 2002. \nSediment load had also decreased from 7.1 billion m3 in the 1960s to just 1 billion m3 by 1999.  \n6.  The increased water demand for irrigation, industry, energy, and residential uses has been \na major reason for the water being intercepted and stored in reservoirs. With the demand for water \nexceeding  supply  in  the  Daiqinghe  River  basin,4  the  frequencies  of  no  or  low  inflows  to \nBaiyangdian Lake have become more acute, especially during \u201cdry\u201d years,5 thus contributing to \nincreased incidences of temporary drying up of the lake. To compound existing water demands, \npopulation growth and expanded agricultural and industrial activities in the upstream and within the \nlake areas have increased wastewater discharges, pollutants and sediments from these sectors \ninto the lake. It is estimated that half of the pollution sources originate from upstream, while the \nother half comes from the more than 100,000 population residing in and around the lake.  \n7.  Activities in the Taiheng Mountains such as logging, quarrying and conversion of natural \nforests and wetlands to agricultural or industrial sites have further contributed to soil erosion and \nland degradation. Large-scale forest fires are also a major threat to the remaining ecosystems in \nthe upper catchment.  \n8.  A major factor in the diminished role of the lake and its catchment to continue providing \nenvironmental  services  has  been  the  weak  institutions  and  inadequate  capacities  of  local \ngovernment staff. Poor planning in the use, allocation, and management of the scarce water \nresource coupled with single-sector approaches to forest and soil erosion, limited understanding of \nthe lake\u2019s integral role in the larger ecosystem and watershed, and conflicting and overlapping \nroles of government agencies at provincial and municipal levels on the allocation of water have \nresulted in its mismanagement. As the economies of the urban centers grew at an average of 11% \nper year, economic growth considerations became the overriding goal of local governments to the \ndetriment of ensuring a sustainable environment. Enforcement of regulatory and policy measures \nfor environmental management often gave way to economic growth considerations. That position \nwas exacerbated by the lack of public awareness of their responsibility to conserve water, and the \nlimited incentives for the private sector to contribute in conserving scarce water resources and in \nprotecting the integrity of the lake catchment and its ecosystem. \n9.  The Government of the PRC recognizes the urgent need to address these issues in a \nholistic  manner  using  integrated  river  basin  and  ecosystem  management  approaches.  Water \npollution control and sustainable use of resources in the water-land ecosystem of Baiyangdian \nLake have been recognized as one of the country\u2019s priority programs. In 2002, the provincial \ngovernment designated the lake as a Provincial Nature Reserve, and in 2003, an area of 34,000 \nhectares of natural forest in the upper catchment was protected. BMG has taken responsibility for \nrestoring  and  managing  the  Baiyangdian  ecosystem.  A  comprehensive  pollution  control  plan \ncosting CNY8.5 billion of public funds has been developed to reduce pollution in the lake by 17%, \nand improve its water quality to Grade III.6 Policy measures, such as prohibiting textile and paper \nmills to be built within a 5 km buffer around the lake, and the introduction of water pricing have also \nbeen implemented.  \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1992. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Haihe Basin Environmental Management \nand Planning Study. Manila. (TA 1835-PRC). \n5  The number of dry years has been on the rise. From 1988 to 1996, there were three recorded dry years. Between \n1997 and 2004, the number of dry years increased to seven.  \n6   A water quality level of grade III is the minimum standard for drinking water. \n ", "  3\n10.  BMG notes, however, that much more needs to be done before the strategic economic and \necosystem  functions  of  the  lake  are  restored.  A  TA  to  BMG  could  catalyze  an  enabling \nenvironment for showcasing an integrated ecosystems approach in water resource planning and \nmanagement7 that is market-based in orientation. It can also serve as prototype for burgeoning \nlocal economies in packaging intervention measures that utilize scarce water resources of the \nlake\u2019s ecosystem in a way that ensures: (i) ecological sustainability of the lake catchment, and (ii) \nfair and equitable sharing among competing users of present and future generations. The lessons \nlearned from this experience will be important to the PRC as the country\u2019s water supply is likely to \nreach its limit by 2030 when the population grows to 1.6 billion, and rivers and lakes are becoming \ndrier or more polluted.8 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impacts  of  the  Project  are  improved  water  quality  and  capacity  and  enhanced \necosystem functioning of the Baiyangdian Lake catchment. To achieve this impact, the TA will help \nBMG develop an investment proposal comprising investment, policy and institutional measures \nthat will address strategically the major pollution problems originating from upstream, midstream, \nand in-lake areas that comprise the Baiyangdian Lake catchment. The intervention measures will \nadopt an integrated ecosystem management approach (footnote 7). Specifically, the TA outputs \nleading to the design of the investment proposal that is suitable for ADB financing will include: \n(i) sector and institutional assessments; (ii) an approved development plan for the Baiyangdian \nLake catchment; (iii) a technical, environmental, economic, financial and social appraisal of the \nsubproject options and their attendant policy measures; (iv) an institutional and capacity-building \nplan;  (v)  a  participatory  gender  plan  and  a  sustainable  livelihood  plan;  (vi)  a  comprehensive \nassessment  of  the  biodiversity  of  the  catchment,  habitat  management  action  plans  and  an \nenvironmental education and public awareness campaign plan; and (vii) environmental impact \nassessments and management plans as well as resettlement plans. The design and monitoring \nframework for the TA is in Appendix 1. \n12.  A  project  that  integrates  ecosystem  restoration  and  biodiversity  conservation  for  the \nBaiyangdian Lake catchment is being proposed under a GEF grant. The project will complement \nand  incrementally  strengthen  the  overall  goals  of  ecosystem  restoration  and  balance  of  the \nproposed  lending  investment  under  ADB  by  ensuring  that  the  global  benefits  of  biodiversity \nconservation are secured at both the source (Taiheng Mountains) and the sink (Baiyangdian Lake). \nThis  GEF  project9  will  focus  on  two  stand-alone  components:  (i)  integrated  biodiversity \n                                                 \n7  The  integrated  ecosystem  management  approach  is  a  strategy  that  applies  multidisciplines  for  integrating  the \nmanagement of land, water, and living resources to ensure the resources\u2019 conservation and their sustainable and \nequitable use. It is closely linked to the concepts of integrated water resource management and integrated river basin \nmanagement, which are tools for implementing the integrated ecosystem management approach. (Global Water \nPartnership Technical Advisory Committee. 2000.  Integrated Water Resources Management, Background Papers, #4.  \nDenmark: Global Water Partnership). \n8  A survey of 514 rivers by the PRC in 2000 reported that 60 rivers have dried up and the water volume in the lakes has \ndecreased  by  14%  (Research  and  Environment  News  from  China.  April  2005. \nwww.swisstalents.org/news/documents/2005/ST_NewsC_April_2005.pdf).  With  water  becoming  scarcer,  the \nGovernment has expressed the urgent need to integrate water resources management as a means of ensuring \nequitable and sustainable use of water and the ecosystem.   \n9 GEF funding was approved in principle by the GEF Secretariat on 11 May 2005. Endorsement by the GEF focal point in \nthe PRC is expected during the third quarter of 2005. If GEF funding is unavailable, the TA can proceed to be \ndeveloped without the GEF components as they provide only supplementary activities; if the components do not \nmaterialize, the core purpose or activities of the Project will not be affected.  \n \n \n ", "4   \nconservation and ecosystem restoration for in-lake and upper catchment areas, and (ii) public \nawareness and education campaigns.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will be implemented using a participatory approach in designing the project. BMG \nhas established a multiagency leading group (LG) at the municipality level that will serve as the \nsteering committee during TA implementation. The LG has designated the Baoding Development \nReform Commission (BDRC) as the lead agency that will oversee the participatory process.  \n14.  The initial weeks of the TA will be devoted to conducting a comprehensive sector and \ninstitutional analysis to determine whether the form of ADB assistance will be more appropriate as \nsector  or  project  lending.  The  subsequent  months  will  be  used  in  evaluating  the  technical, \neconomic, financial and social appraisal of the subprojects comprising the project as well as \nimproving the development plan of the Baiyangdian Lake catchment.  \n15.  The key activities of the TA and the GEF project are: (i) reviewing and analyzing: (a) the \nBaiyangdian Lake catchment as a sector,  (b) its development plans, programs, projects, policies, \nand  institutional  aspects  and  patterns  of  participation  that  impact  on  Baiyangdian  Lake\u2019s \necosystem and similar ecosystems in the PRC; and (c) lessons learned from these experiences \nand international practices on integrated ecosystems management approach and water resource \nplanning  and  management  of  lake  ecosystems;  (ii)  conducting  stakeholder  consultations  and \nworkshops during inception, midterm and draft final TA phases; (iii) assessing the subproject \noptions\u2019 technical, financial, economic and social viability to determine the appropriate mix of \ninvestment and policy interventions that will ensure maximum net benefits vis-\u00e0-vis a without-\nproject scenario; (iv) assessing subproject options for environmental impact, poverty reduction, \nsocial impact, and involuntary resettlement using ADB guidelines; (v) assessing training needs of \nlocal government implementers and other stakeholders; and (vi) conducting biodiversity survey and \ncomprehensive assessment to detail the existing baseline situation regarding the biodiversity in the \nBaiyangdian Lake catchment. An initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated as $887,000 equivalent, comprising $354,300 in \nforeign exchange and $532,700 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested that \nADB finance $500,000 and that GEF finance $207,000. ADB will finance $254,300 of the foreign \nexchange cost and $245,700 equivalent of the local currency cost; this part of the TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The expected GEF grant assistance of \n$207,000 will be used to finance $107,000 of the foreign exchange cost and $100,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The GEF grant will be administered by ADB. The Government will \nfinance the balance of the local cost, equivalent to $180,000, through the provision of counterpart \ncosts and services. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to financing any ensuing project. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 3. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Executing Agency (EA) will be BDRC. It will: (i) facilitate coordination among the offices \nconcerned in BMG, ADB, and TA consultants; (ii) provide access to data and other information that \nwill be required in the sector and institutional assessment, and the formulation and development of \nthe project; (iii) prepare and submit on time the development plan for the Baiyangdian Lake \ncatchment,  the  reports  on  environmental  impact  assessments  and  resettlement  plans  for  the \nsubprojects,  and  the  gender  and  livelihood  plans;  (iv) assist  in  preparing  the  training  needs \nassessment and conducting the biodiversity survey; and (v) be responsible for ensuring the active \n ", "  5\nparticipation of the major stakeholders during TA implementation. The LG will play the steering \ncommittee role. Its functions are to: (i) oversee the implementation of the investment plan for the \nBaiyangdian  Lake  catchment  area,  (ii)  select  criteria  for  the  subprojects,  and  (iii)  ensure \ninstitutional coordination at provincial and central government levels.  \n18.  The TA will be carried out over 7 months, commencing in September 2005 and will be \ncompleted by March 2006. A total of 63.5 person-months of consulting services will be required: \n11.5  international  and  51  domestic.  The  international  consultants  will  provide  expertise  in \nintegrated ecosystem management, waste management, economics, and wetland management. \nThe domestic consultants will have expertise in water resource planning/institutional development, \nsustainable livelihood and social development, agroforest ecology, resettlement, environmental \nimpact  assessment,  financial  analysis/finance  management,  environmental  economics,  waste \nmanagement engineering, water resources and/or hydraulic engineering, ecology restoration and \nGEF project development, tourism, and environmental education and public awareness. Terms of \nreference for consulting services are in Appendix 4. ADB will engage a firm in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The selection process will \nfollow  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  using  simplified  technical  proposal \nprocedures.  The  consultants  will  procure  equipment  for  the  TA  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement.  \n19.  At the end of the first month, the consultant team will submit to the EA and ADB an \ninception report which will be discussed in a tripartite review meeting and a stakeholder workshop. \nAt the end of the fourth month from the start of the TA, a midterm report will be submitted to the EA \nand  ADB,  which  will  include  the  preliminary  findings  of  the  assessment  of  various  project \ncomponents. The midterm report will incorporate the suggestions raised during the second multi-\nstakeholder workshop and will culminate in a second tripartite review meeting. One month before \nthe end of the assignment, a draft final report will be submitted to the EA and ADB and will be \npresented by the consultant in a major stakeholder workshop. A third tripartite review meeting will \nalso be held to discuss the draft final report. The suggestions and comments generated during the \nstakeholder workshop and the third tripartite review meeting will be incorporated into the TA final \nreport.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  stand-alone  component  of  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $207,000 to be financed by the GEF on a grant basis; \nand (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis, to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  preparing  the  Integrated  Ecosystem \nManagement  and  Environmental  Protection  of  the  Baiyangdian  Lake  Catchment  Project,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.

No \nContribution of the sector or sub-sector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): The subsectors of \nenvironment and biodiversity, water resource management, and forestry play important roles for ensuring life support systems \nfor society in general and for reducing poverty in particular. Freshwater-based ecosystems (including lakes, watersheds, \nwetlands, floodplains, and estuaries) regulate freshwater quality and quantity, and provide crucial habitat for fish, amphibians \nand plant species. The reed beds and other wetland plants remove toxins and excessive nutrients from the water, while \nfloodplain wetlands reduce flood risks. Forested headwater catchments also reduce the risks of floods and soil erosion by \npreventing runoff. Cycling the water through forests likewise regulates both local and global climate and maintain local water \nresources. Degradation and overexploitation of freshwater ecosystems, biodiversity and forests will result in loss of these vital \necological functions and adversely affect human life. Poor people suffer most from deterioration of ecosystems as they are the \nmost directly dependent on ecosystems for their immediate survival.  \nIn the PRC, the number of lakes and other freshwater ecosystems has declined dramatically. A survey of 514 rivers in the \nPRC in 2000 found that 60 have already dried up, while the water volume in lakes that were monitored was reduced by 14%. \nMoreover, 25% of the 2,000 water sources surveyed recorded water grade quality of greater than III, the minimum standard \nfor drinking water. Recently, the Government noted that more than 360 million rural people lacked access to safe drinking \nwater. In cities, water shortages have been occurring, resulting in serious health concerns.  \nThe present use of water in the PRC is 68% for irrigation, 20% for urban areas and industry, and less than one seventh to \nmeet the needs of ecosystems to sustain life itself. The unsustainable use of scarce water will have adverse implications for \nthe future. Already it is projected that at the present pace of water utilization (with limited recourse for increasing and \nconserving water supply), water supply would reach its limit by 2030. There is an urgent call from the Government to put in \nplace a workable integrated ecosystems management approach in water resource use planning and management to ensure a \nmore equitable and sustainable use of this scarce resource as well as  restore and protect the ecosystem services of \nfreshwater ecosystems.  \nIn addition, a large number of poor people reside on the periphery of or within the lake/freshwater areas. The majority depend \non the lake for their income and water source. The lake also serves as the main depository of their wastes. With increased \npollution in these freshwater ecosystems, the quality of life of lake-based residents has been affected. Incomes derived from \nthe lakes (such as reed bed production, fishery, etc.) have declined. Illnesses due to waterborne diseases have risen. There is \nalso a need to develop sustainable livelihood sources for the poor who depend on freshwater ecosystems, while restoring and \nprotecting the ecological functions of these ecosystems. Intervention measures should at the same time promote integrated \necosystem management by local communities to reduce poverty in ways that retain the productive and regenerative \ncapacities of ecosystems.  \nThe proposed project would provide a good case-in-point for showcasing poverty alleviation approaches that would at the \nsame time address the pollution contributed by the poor on Baiyangdian Lake, the only freshwater ecosystem in northern \nChina, and its upstream (Taiheng Mountains) and midstream catchment areas. A community-based integrated ecosystems \nmanagement approach will be used in identifying the strategic package of investment, policy and institutional measures. \nProject interventions will focus on demonstrating the positive effects of best management practices in sustainable natural \nresource production on biodiversity populations within Baiyangdian Lake and the Taiheng Mountains, such as (i) programs to \nimprove reed management, production and harvesting practices within the Baiyangdian lake and similar initiatives for wild \nherbs, fungi and nut harvests in the Taiheng Mountains, (ii) community programs to enhance village environments and \nshowcase biodiversity conservation areas at the village level, and (iii) downstream processing investments that are based on \nsustainable natural resource exploitation. Moreover, development of public-private sector partnerships through best practices \nin tourism management will be used to demonstrate the viability of attaining both commercial profit and biodiversity benefits \nand to showcase a sustainable approach for protected area management and biodiversity conservation that can be replicated \nin the PRC\u2019s other environmentally degraded watersheds and water-scarce landscapes with a poor population base.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? Baoding is the third largest municipality in Hebei Province, with a total area of \n22,112 square kilometers (km2) and a population of 10,830,000 in 2004. The municipality has 22 counties and 4 urban \ndistricts. Total gross domestic product in 2004 was CNY11.1 billion. It is a middle-income municipality with farmers\u2019  per  \ncapita  income at  CNY2,921 in 2003  (higher than the mean for the PRC and the province),  and a disposable income per \ncapita for urban residents of CNY7,139 (slightly lower than the mean for the PRC and the province). Income poverty incidence \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nwas 7% of the total population in 2000, and is declining. The growth rate in income in recent years, averaged 11% per annum, \nand contributed to the decline in poverty.  \nThe shares of economic growth have been uneven. Urban per capita income was two times higher than average rural income \nper capita. The lowest per capita income and the poorest households (per capita incomes are just over the official poverty \nthreshold of CNY625 per person per annum) are in environment-sensitive areas. In 2000, 679,700 poor people resided in 975 \nvillages of 11 counties of the municipality; 929 of those villages were in mountainous zones in the northwest of Baoding. \nAbout 46 of the villages with poor people are located on the periphery and degraded wetland ecosystems of the Baiyangdian \nLake. The main income sources of upland-based farmers are crop production on slope land, livestock, and vegetable and fruit \nproduction. The causes of poverty include serious drought, especially in the past few years (it was estimated that 360,000 \nfarmers slid back to poverty due to the drought), the lack of croplands, limited job opportunities, and low productivity. It was \nnot common for local farmers to find off-farm employment in urban areas. The main livelihood of the poor residing in the \nperipheral and wetland areas of Baiyangdian Lake are reed production, fish harvesting and farming (including fish nets and \nponds), tourism services, small-scale business, and off-farm labor, with high levels of migration to urban areas such as Beijing \nand Tianjin. Access to potable drinking water is a major constraint in these poor villages and most of Baoding municipality. \nAside from low income, in-lake households face greater risk from waterborne diseases and respiratory illnesses. Although there \nare no records of health indicators, the extreme lack of clean drinking water and serious pollution of the lake (often their food \nsource) have become major health hazards.  \nBecause the poor are located in specific villages with environment-sensitive features, poverty analysis for the project will be \ndone at subproject level, and will focus on counties and villages with poor people. Initial assessment showed that of the 12 \ncounties included in the proposed Baiyangdian Lake catchment area, 3 (Fupin, Tangxian and Laiyuan) are classified as national \npoverty reduction counties where the average household income was below CNY1,980 in 2003. Five more counties (Yixian, \nLaishui, Mancheng, Anxin and Xiongxian) for the proposed project are designated as provincial poverty counties.  \nBaiyangdian Lake has 39 in-lake villages, which are surrounded by water in the lake, and 44 semi-in-lake villages, which are \npartly surrounded by water in the lake. An estimated 100,000 persons live in the in-lake villages and another 100,000 persons in \nthe surrounding areas of the lake. Of the 39 in-lake villages, 24 villages were listed as poverty villages by Hebei provincial \ngovernment.  \nOther poverty areas in the project area are in Shahe irrigation area especially in Quyan County, and the upstream mountainous \narea of Wangkuai and Xidayang reservoirs.  For example, 21 villages with a population of 30,000 persons who are registered as \npoor households are found in Shahe irrigation area in Quyang County. \nThe livelihood of poor households residing in environment-sensitive areas is directly threatened by loss of biodiversity. Women in \nparticular who depend on the goods and services that ecosystems provide for income bear the brunt of environmental \ndegradation. About half of the population on the in-lake villages of Baiyangdian Lake is women. Their income sources are derived \nfrom fish and duck farming, reed collection and sorting, and small-scale bed and breakfast types of services. Income from these \nsources has decreased in the past years due to the deterioration of the water quality of the lake. The men in these villages have \nsought work outside of their villages, putting more pressure on the women in terms of increased household responsibilities \n(including taking care of the elders) and additional effort expended on declining existing revenue sources due to limited access to \nand availability of skills enhancement programs. Alternative income sources are further hampered by women\u2019s constrained \naccess to financial resources. Women\u2019s health is also sacrificed as they, the children, and the elders tend to be more exposed to \nthe polluted conditions of the water and poisonous toxins from the lake\u2019s environment.  With less time to spare for recreational \nand other community-based activities, women\u2019s participation in community organizations and commercial networks is severely \nrestricted.  \nFocus group discussions (with attention to vulnerable groups such as women) will be undertaken to determine the nature of \npoverty  and  the  linkage  of  income  and  non-income  poverty  and  environment.  Participatory  methods  will  be  used  in \ndetermining sustainable livelihood measures (ecotourism) with strong community and private sector involvement. These will \nbe combined with the development of ecological infrastructure and/or policy measures that will address the pollution problems \nand encourage the poor communities to conserve water, protect environmental services, and improve their access to safe \ndrinking water. Public education information campaigns will also be incorporated, especially in the Baiyangdian Lake as half of \nthe pollution sources originate from the lake-based residents.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nA brief stakeholder analysis was conducted and the role of each stakeholder group was defined. The stakeholders who were \nconsulted included government at the provincial to municipal to local levels: the water, forest, and nature reserve staff; \ngovernment staff from conservancy bureau, poverty reduction office, and representatives from health, education, forest, and \nenvironment offices, irrigators,  village leaders, women, and poor farmer households. Their expectations and needs; and the \npotential project impacts on them were identified. More detailed poverty analysis will be done during the technical assistance \n(TA) phase when the resettlement plans, gender development plans,  and  public  participation  plans  will  be  developed  in \nconsultation with the stakeholders.  \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nTo strengthen the project design and enhance the sustainability of the project, a community-based approach to planning, \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation will be emphasized during all phases of project design and implementation. To \nenhance the sense of ownership, three community-level project working groups will be set up: project planning working group, \nproject implementation group, and project monitoring group. These groups will play different roles throughout the project. \nEach  group  will  include  community  leaders,  women,  and  the  poor.  Participatory  mechanisms  that  encourage  more \nparticipation of the vulnerable groups and appropriately manage the participation of more articulate and vested interest groups \nwill be explored.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nGender analysis: The division of labor by gender is evident in the project area: men are more inclined to conduct outside \nactivities, work as migrant labor, and do heavy physical activities, while women are more responsible for and tend to carry out \nfarming and household chores. Women have lower education levels than men. Women have also less representation in \ncommunity affairs. To maximize the involvement of women, a gender analysis will be undertaken, including, inter alia, an \nassessment of the roles and relations of gender groups in relation to the ecosystem, the nature and level of involvement of \ngender groups in local organizations that address the ecosystem, the nature and extent of understanding of gender issues \nand environment among environment-related institutions, capacity-building activities, etc.  \nGender and development plan: The project will not have significant negative impacts on women, but a gender plan will need \nto be prepared given that local staffs have low gender sensitivities and lack knowledge and skills for gender analysis and \nmainstreaming of gender concerns.   The gender plan will ensure the equal participation of women in the whole project cycle \nand their commensurate share and involvement in the project benefits: livelihood action and the capacity-building activities. .  \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes      No \nTo be undertaken during the TA phase. The output will include (i) gender analysis that looks at, inter alia, knowledge and \nunderstanding of conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; how different stakeholders are involved in decision-making \nprocesses affecting their access to, use of and control over water resources; an outline of the structure of local organizations \nand the ways in which gender has access to and participation in them; and the impact of existing power relations among \nvarious interests and actors in the community; and (ii) a livelihood action plan.  \n \nE.
