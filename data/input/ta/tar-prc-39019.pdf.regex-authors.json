The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assistance to prepare the proposed Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion Environmental Improvement Project. The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) \nconcept paper was approved on 22 February 2005. From 24 February to 3 March 2005, a fact-\nfinding  mission  visited  the  PRC  and  reached  an  agreement  with  the  Government  on  the \nobjectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements of the TA.1 \nThe TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC has severe environmental problems, including air pollution associated with \nrapid  economic  growth,  heavy  reliance  on  coal  as  the  primary  fuel,  and  use  of  obsolete \ntechnology. The State Environmental Protection Administration estimates that since the early \n1990s, pollution has resulted in a loss to the PRC economy of approximately 4% of gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP).  Air  pollution  accounts  for  59%  of  this  loss. 2  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region (IMAR) is one of the PRC provinces experiencing severe air pollution \nproblems due to its heavy reliance on coal as the primary fuel for its many heavy industries and \nsmall coal-fired heating boilers. Before 2002, only one of the major cities in IMAR met the \nnational class II air quality standards. Due to the Government\u2019s concerted efforts to close small \nand highly polluting heating boilers, urban air quality has improved in recent years. In 2003, 3 of \nthe 14 major cities in IMAR met the national class II air quality standards.  \n \n3.  Urban  heating  demand  has  increased  rapidly  in  the  PRC  due  to  rising  incomes, \nprivatization of residential housing, and housing sector growth. As incomes increase, people \nliving in the cold northern and northwest provinces have demanded more and reliable heating. \nCentral heating in terms of square meters (m2) recorded an annual growth rate of 16% between \n1992 and 2003. Nationwide, residential buildings account for about 70% of the total space \nheated; commercial and public buildings account for the remaining 30%. Heating demand in \nIMAR has also increased rapidly during the past decade. In the PRC, over 60 million tons (t) of \ncoal are burned by 500,000 small, inefficient, coal-fired heating boilers every year, resulting in \nthe emission of substantial amounts of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and total \nsuspended  particulates.  The  majority  of  urban  heating  supplies  in  IMAR  come  from  small \nboilers, which contribute significantly to air pollution problems in urban areas. \n \n4.  IMAR has a population of about 24 million; 26% live in urban areas. Continued strong \neconomic growth, combined with a significant increase in urban housing construction, has \nresulted  in  heating  demand  outpacing  supply.  Cities  in  IMAR  experience  heating  supply \nshortages during the 5-month winter season; this adversely affects quality of life and health of \nurban  residents,  particularly  the  poor.  The  adverse  effects  of  urban  poverty  are  often \ncompounded by environmental pollution from energy and heating sources at the household \nlevel. The poor do not have the information, access, or funds for more efficient (less polluting) \nequipment and fuel. The gas and heating distribution systems often function poorly or are \nabsent in the poorer sections of the city. Poorly maintained gas and heating distribution systems \nincrease the exposure of the poor to daily doses of pollutants as well as to the risk of accidents. \nIndoor air pollution particularly puts women and children at risk. By improving the efficiency and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 9 March 2005. \n2  Based on a study by the Policy Research Center for Environment and Economy of the State Environmental \nProtection Administration. \n ", "2   \ncapacity of city gas and heating distribution, closing the existing small heating boilers in project \ncities, and implementing tariff reforms and special tariff reduction programs, the Project will help \nreduce environmental pollution and ensure that the poor have an affordable and adequate \nheating supply. The Project will also entail enhanced levels of safety (safe gas distribution), in \naddition to direct benefits to the poor. \n \n5.  As one of the 12 western provinces, IMAR has benefited less than the east coast from \neconomic growth and reforms. Incomes are lower; poverty is more widespread; health and \neducation  indicators  are  lower;  land  degradation  problems  are  serious;  and  physical \ninfrastructure has weaknesses, including roads, railways, power, and telecommunications. In \n2003 the average per capita GDP in IMAR was CNY8,734, lower than the national average of \nCNY9,046.  Of  the  province\u2019s  101  counties,  31  are  national  poverty  counties  and  29  are \nprovincial poverty counties. The fiscal revenue of the poverty counties cannot cover salaries of \nthe government officials, teachers, and health personnel. Investments in basic education and \npublic health are inadequate. In 2003, about 1.3 million people, more than 10% of IMAR\u2019s rural \npopulation, lived on incomes below the official poverty line,3 compared with the PRC\u2019s national \npoverty incidence of 3%. About 2.5 million people, or 18% of the rural population, had incomes \nbelow the international poverty line of $1/day. \n \n6.  In IMAR, the average heating bill for a poor household living in a 40 m2 apartment unit is \nabout CNY150 per month during the heating season. In a typical poor household of four, the \nincome at the poverty line is about CNY650 per household per month under the average city \npoverty line. Thus, the heating bill represents about 23% of a poor household\u2019s monthly income. \nThis indicates a serious affordability problem for poor households with income at or below the \ncity poverty lines. In the project areas where the temperature in the winter can go as low as \nminus 25o Celsius, insufficient heating supply will severely affect the quality of life and health of \nthe poor. The government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (GIMAR) is making efforts to \nprovide urban minimum living standard and social assistance programs to address the growing \nconcern of urban poverty. Cost savings resulting from the efficiency improvement of the Project \nwill be passed on to the poor in the form of lower gas and heating bills, and connection fee \ndiscounts. The TA will design assistance programs under the Project to alleviate affordability \nproblems and ensure sufficient heating for the poor in the project cities. This effort will be \nsupported by earlier ADB work addressing heating supply for the poor in the PRC.4 \n \n7.  The resources of local governments and those provided by the central Government are \ninadequate to finance the large-scale investments required by rising gas and heating demand. \nSo far, private sector involvement in gas distribution systems in the PRC has been weak and \nonly a few joint ventures have been involved in combined heat and power generation plants. \nThese subsectors do not provide enough incentives to make them attractive to private investors, \nbecause of (i) technical/institutional uncertainties involving city governments\u2019 control over gas \nand heating distribution; (ii) heating being considered a welfare measure, leading to poor fee \ncollection; and (iii) lack of clear and transparent tariff setting for both gas and heat supply. To \nencourage private sector participation in areas where only the public sector has previously been \ninvolved, an enabling environment needs to be created. ADB policy dialogue in tariff reforms \nand institutional changes will promote private sector participation by helping create the enabling \nenvironment. Further, specific opportunities have to be identified for the private sector to share \n                                                 \n3  PRC\u2019s official rural poverty line of CNY637 per capita/year is low compared with international rates.  \n4  ADB. 2000.

The TA is currently under \nimplementation. \n ", "  3\npart of the investment needs and functions, like initial public offerings of gas and heating \ncompanies, operation and maintenance contracts, and billing and collection services. \n \n8.  One of the Government's main development objectives is to improve the quality of the \nenvironment  in  cities  and  integrate  environmental  planning  with  economic  and  social \ndevelopment efforts.5 The aim is to contain the worsening trend of environmental pollution and \necosystem degradation, and to improve the environment in cities to demonstrate that rapid \neconomic growth and a cleaner environment are compatible. The Government is planning to \nstrengthen its control of pollutant discharge through the issuance of regulations on total pollutant \ncontrol for selected cities and designated river basins and regions. Air quality in cities is to be \nimproved by substituting coal with gas where feasible, modernizing and closing polluting boilers \nand industries, and increasing the use of technologies and fuels that minimize urban pollution. \n \n9.  The ADB operational strategy in the PRC aims to help the country achieve economic \ngrowth in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner. In the energy sector, the ADB strategy \nsupports the Government's energy development program aimed at expanding energy supplies \nand promoting energy conservation and end-use efficiency. ADB strategy for the environment \nsector and gas subsector focuses on strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for \nsustainable  environmental  management,  supporting  the  utilization  of  economic  and  other \nmeasures to ensure sustainable utilization of natural resources, and promoting the use of \ncleaner technologies. The ADB poverty reduction strategy for the PRC envisages a range of \nmeasures including providing goods and services directly to the most vulnerable members of \nsociety and promoting sustainable growth. Therefore, the proposed Project will support the PRC \nand GIMAR development priorities and is consistent with the ADB environment strategy and \nobjective of poverty reduction. A summary initial poverty and social analysis is attached as \nAppendix 2. \n \n10.  Project completion reports prepared for three ADB environment projects and the project \ncompletion and project performance audit reports for one of the environment projects revealed \nthat the achievements of some clean technology and heating supply components were lower \nthan  estimated  at  appraisal.  The envisaged benefits  were  not  achieved  in  some  chemical \nindustries (e.g., caustic soda, cement kilns, and ceramic products) because the imported clean \ntechnology could not be properly transferred. In the case of coke oven gas projects, the steel \nmill derived the benefit, but targets for supplies to households were not achieved. \n \n11.  Several factors affected the outcome of heating supply components, such as lower \ndemand for heating, insufficient heat source, unsuitable design for switching from coal to natural \ngas, and lower heat and power tariffs than anticipated at project appraisal. Some projected \nindustrial establishments either did not materialize or lacked the financial capacity to pay for \nheating services. Some heating components were canceled when no noticeable progress was \nmade and after the project implementation agencies realized that the projected market for \nsteam and heat usage was overly optimistic. In addition, the design to switch these heating \ncompanies\u2019 fuel source from coal to natural gas would have seriously affected their financial \nviability and required large government subsidies. The lower heat and power tariffs coupled with \nlower demand affected financial performance of heating supply companies. \n \n                                                 \n5.  The Government is planning to prepare and promulgate a law on environmental impact assessment that will \nrequire strategic environment assessments for all proposed national planning and policy development activities and \nfull integration of possible environmental impacts in the decision-making process. \n ", "4   \n12.  The proposed Project will not include assistance for clean technology in industries. It will \nensure the viability and sustainability of heating supply by incorporating the lessons from earlier \nprojects for design, preparation, risk assessment, and implementation. A demand analysis will \nbe carried out to ensure that demand for the central heating and gas supplies will be sufficient. \nThe expected improvement in efficiency by about 20%, and the improved bill collection under \nthe  Project  will  improve  the  gas  and  heating  companies\u2019  financial  performance.  Strong \neconomic performance is expected in IMAR, based on the Western Development Strategy \nunder which the Government has made a strong commitment to accelerate development in the \nwestern region. The gas and central heating distribution systems under the Project are based \non proven designs and conventional technologies that have been successfully used in the PRC. \nThough the gas and heating supply in IMAR have been demonstrated as viable activities, \nprecautions will be taken by carefully assessing the project risks during project preparation. The \nrisk of delay to construction due to late internal approvals and procurement will be addressed by \nearly preparation and procurement training during TA implementation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The  project  preparatory  TA  will  help  the  Government  to  design  and  prepare  an \nenvironmental improvement project in IMAR. The project preparatory TA outcome will be an \nagreement with GIMAR and central Government on project design, detailed feasibility report, \nand implementation arrangements for the Project. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will (i) assess the gas and heating markets in IMAR; (ii) determine demand-side \nmanagement potential; (iii) carry out demand forecast and gas and heating supply system \nplanning, including least-cost gas and heating supply system planning, and incorporation of \ndemand-side  management  options;  (iv) evaluate  the  technical  feasibility  and  engineering \naspects of the Project; (v) provide cost estimates and procurement arrangements, and prepare \na contract packaging plan; (vi) carry out the economic and financial analyses; (vii) prepare the \nenvironmental impact assessment and land acquisition and resettlement plan, and provide \nsummaries  of  each;  (viii) analyze  the  financial  governance  and  financial  performance \nimplementation agencies; (ix) recommend necessary enterprise and sector reforms; (x) evaluate \nthe poverty impact of the Project and identify ways to make the Project more pro-poor, including \ndesigning  assistance  programs  on  heating  tariffs  for  the  poor;  (xi) establish  monitorable \nindicators and a monitoring mechanism; and (xii) support private sector participation in the \nProject.  \n \n15.  The  major  assumptions  and  risks  that  need  to  be  considered  for  successful  TA \nimplementation include a change in GIMAR\u2019s priorities, lack of adequate and in-time provision of \ndata, delay in submission of required studies, delay in consultant selection, and poor consultant \nperformance. Efforts will be made to ensure that competent consultants will be recruited in time. \nGIMAR agrees to provide adequate counterpart support and data when needed. GIMAR also \nagrees to undertake and update all required studies according to a timetable agreed with ADB. \nClose coordination among the consultants, executing and implementing agencies, and ADB will \nfurther mitigate these risks. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $700,000  equivalent  with  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of \n$340,000  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $360,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  $500,000 \nequivalent to finance the foreign exchange cost and $160,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. GIMAR will \ncontribute $200,000 equivalent to finance the remaining local currency cost. Details of the cost \nestimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that \nprovision of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will be carried out by a consulting firm with experience in gas and heating \nsupply;  institutional,  economic,  financial,  environmental,  and  social  analyses;  and  impact \nassessment. The international consultants will include (i) a gas transmission and distribution \nspecialist, (ii) a private sector development specialist, (iii) an environmental economist, (iv) a \nsocial and resettlement specialist, (v) a financial analyst, and (vi) an institutional specialist. The \ndomestic consultants will include (i) a gas transmission and distribution specialist, (ii) a central \nheating specialist, (iii) a private sector development specialist, (iv) an environmental economist, \n(v) a social and resettlement specialist, (vi) a financial analyst, (vii) an institutional specialist, \nand  (viii)  a  monitoring  specialist  to  assist  with  data  collection  and  processing  and  project \nmonitoring. Domestic consultants will assist the international consultants in their respective \nfields. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the \nUse of the Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of \ndomestic consultants. The services of consultants will be provided through a consulting firm \nselected after the submission of simplified technical proposals and the use of the quality- and \ncost-based selection method. An estimated total of 28 person-months of consulting services will \nbe required: 8 for international and 20 for domestic services. The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are given in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  GIMAR will establish a project office comprising specialists in the relevant areas and \nheaded by an experienced senior staff person to coordinate with the consultants during the \nproject preparatory TA work. GIMAR will provide interpreters, local transportation, and office \nspace in Huhehaote equipped with suitable facilities.6 Some of the office equipment will be \nfinanced under the TA and will be procured by the international consultants in accordance with \nADB Guidelines for Procurement. The TA is expected to commence in June 2005 and be \ncompleted by April 2006.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.

Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nBasic poverty and social analysis is proposed (Appendix 4). The technical assistance (TA) will look at the \nincidence of poverty using existing data sources and supplementing it through the social survey of \npotential beneficiaries. Both income and nonincome poverty indices will be determined. The analysis will \nbe carried out following the Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis1 and Handbook for Integrating \nPoverty Impact on Economic Analysis of Projects.2 Particular attention is to be given to profiling the \nbeneficiaries, including gender disaggregated demographic, economic, and social data where possible, \nplus the incidence of poverty, vulnerable groups, and any adverse impacts anticipated from the Project. \n \n \nC.
