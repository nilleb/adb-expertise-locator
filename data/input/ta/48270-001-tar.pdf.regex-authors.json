INTRODUCTION \n1.  At  the  19th  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Ministerial  Conference,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) was encouraged to work with GMS countries to strengthen links and \nsynergies between national and regional business reform agendas.1 Government and business \nleaders realize that improving the business regulation environment and achieving commitments \non regional economic integration are critical to competitiveness and to sustained economic \ngrowth. The challenging reform agenda has triggered greater demand for timely and high-quality \npolicy advice on business environment issues. ADB and the Government of Australia jointly \nresponded with small-scale technical assistance (TA) to develop the design of a regional TA \nsupporting private sector development (PSD).2 Conceptualization of the proposed TA was done \nthrough extensive stakeholder consultations with institutions involved in PSD (Supplementary \nAppendix A). Analytic work, prepared under the small-scale TA, as well as past evaluations and \nexisting reform programs were the basis of these consultations. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Countries within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are all pursuing \nbusiness environment reforms under national PSD agendas to reach the targets of the ASEAN \nEconomic  Community  (AEC)  by  31  December  2015.  Progress  has  however  been  slow.4 \nCambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam (CLMV) generally lag \nbehind largely due to their limited capacity to implement reforms (Supplementary Appendix B). \nThe ASEAN development gap is a risk to regional economic integration. \n \n3.  To bridge the ASEAN development gap, several regional programs are being initiated, \nincluding  the  Initiative  for  ASEAN  Integration  and  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS) \nprogram. ADB support under the GMS program is focused primarily on AEC pillar 1 (trade \nfacilitation and strengthening of food security and cooperation in the agriculture sector) and AEC \npillar  2  (infrastructure  development  and  development  of  energy  and  mineral  cooperation). \nInterventions under AEC pillar 3 (development of small and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs], \nand implementation of the Initiative for ASEAN Integration) are more limited and the private \nsector's involvement is marginal. \n \n4.  The private sector in CLMV is still in its infancy after a long history of centralized \nplanning and government control. While the business communities in CLMV are diverse in \nnature  and  the  PSD  challenges  somewhat  country  specific,  all  face  common  problems  in \ndeveloping  competitive  market  economies.  Except for  Viet  Nam,  these  countries  still  have \nagrarian economic structures with limited manufacturing industries. Spillovers from foreign direct \ninvestment to the domestic private sector have been limited. This is partly because of a \u201cmissing \nmiddle\u201d of larger domestic private firms, since SMEs account for well over 90% of all enterprises, \nand up to 75% of employment. 5 Many operate informally and are disadvantaged as a result. \nWomen-run enterprises tend to remain informal.    \n \n                                                \n1  19th GMS Ministerial Conference. 2013.

Jakarta. \n5  ADB has prepared updated private sector assessments for CLMV to inform TA design. Summaries of these \nassessments are in supplementary appendixes C to F. \n ", "2   \n5.   Regional economic integration will provide opportunities for local CLMV businesses to \nintegrate into regional and global value chains, and thereby facilitate economic diversification. \nAs the AEC moves toward a higher level of market integration, new perspectives are opening \nfor these firms. Innovative and high-growth domestic private firms will have an opportunity to \ntransform their businesses. The prospects for SMEs in CLMV are promising because they \nproduce many marketable products and are geographically very mobile. The respective private \nsectors, however, face many limitations to effective competitiveness in global markets, and \ngenerally operate in weak business regulation environments.  \n \n6.  Informal businesses unable to grow domestically and lacking access to regional \nand  international  markets.  Most  SMEs  have  restricted  access  to  international  markets \nbecause of increasingly prevalent requirements for quality and traceability. Informal enterprises \ntend to trade among themselves, rarely accessing the growth opportunities that come from large, \nformal customers or regional supply chains. Although SME-supporting government policies are \noften proposed and enacted, they are most commonly introduced as top-down prescriptions \ninappropriate for the needs of the domestic private sector. These policies are often ad hoc and \ndirected toward short-term benefits rather than the essential fundamental structural reforms that \nare needed. The importance of the profit motive has not always been fully recognized, and \npolicies have generally not encouraged business formalization and growth. \n \n7.  Weak implementation of business laws. Despite past and ongoing regulatory reforms \nthat spurred  initial  efforts  at  global  and  regional  economic  integration  across  CLMV,  legal \nplatforms to support a robust and developing private sector remain weak. PSD policies are \nsometimes inconsistent with commitments under the regional economic integration agenda, \nwhile business laws are often poorly implemented. This creates uneven conditions that do not \nfoster the economic inclusion of local entrepreneurs and SMEs. Many do not register because \nthe process is too burdensome and costly and the benefits are too meager. As business \nregulation  reforms  are  implemented  and  CLMV  national  business  laws  progress  toward \ninternational standards, domestic enterprises must be encouraged to take advantage. \n \n8.  Small and medium-sized enterprises lacking access to financial services. Many \nSMEs and entrepreneurs in CLMV lack awareness of available financial services, and have \ndifficulty defining and articulating their financing needs. Demand-side constraints include weak \nbusiness development skills and low corporate governance standards. Limited financial access \nconstrains SMEs\u2019 innovation capability and their ability to participate in regional and global value \nchains. The problem is exacerbated by poorly functioning land registration systems, stringent \ncollateral requirements, and inadequate protection of creditor rights. National financial systems \nand  regulations  are  not  conducive  to  the  promotion  of  alternative  financial  products  and \ndiversified financial markets. For SMEs and informal businesses with limited traditional assets to \nuse as collateral, more flexible legal frameworks allowing the use of alternative collateral (i.e., a \nsecured transaction framework) and innovative and suitable financial products are needed.6  \n  \n9.  Regional cooperation offers strategic opportunities to improve the business environment. \nBy acting together, GMS partners can exploit economies of scale and competitive efficiencies to \nenable activities that otherwise may not occur. For example, the presence within the region of \nwell-developed  country  financial  systems,  proven  business  models,  and  industry  support \ninstitutions offer strategic resources to support less-developed countries with less-developed \nfinancial systems. The establishment of common business regulation standards, codes, and \n                                                \n6 A secured transaction framework is a legal framework that consists of a law and a registry and allows banks to \nsecure security interest on movable assets. \n ", "  3 \nbenchmarks can also spur reforms. Harmonization of business rules will support intraregional \ntrade and investment. Opportunities exist for supporting the provision of regional public goods \nwhere CLMV currently lack the capacity or resources for national institutions. Strengthening of \nprivate sector institutions such as the GMS Business Forum and its core members, as well as \nwomen-led business associations in CLMV, is also needed to develop platforms for effective \ndialogue and information sharing. \n \n10.  The challenging reform agenda has triggered greater demand for timely and high-quality \npolicy advice on business environment issues. Development partners have responded with \nmany  ongoing  PSD  activities  across  the  GMS  countries  (Supplementary  Appendix  G)  but \nexisting national activities are quite fragmented. Stronger links and synergies with the regional \neconomic integration agenda can support national business reforms. An evaluation of a past \nregional PSD policy advisory trust fund managed by the International Finance Corporation \nemphasized the importance of maintaining strategic focus, an effective portfolio monitoring and \nevaluation framework, and donor coordination.7  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n11.  The Mekong Business Initiative (MBI) will be a policy advisory and advocacy facility to \npromote PSD, business formalization, and growth in value chains in the GMS region, with a \nfocus on CLMV. It will support business-enabling reforms and not be used to prepare non-\nsovereign transactions. The MBI will \u201cthink regionally and act nationally\u201d in that it is a regional \ninitiative focusing on common regional issues, but offering national solutions. The MBI will \ninitially focus on stakeholder consultations, diagnostic work, and advocacy activities with the \nintention of spurring demand for reforms. The MBI will look to gradually build up a reform \nprogram in response to demand from CLMV private sector entities and governments. Significant \nresources will therefore be set aside to support reform implementation. The MBI will also \nsupport capacity building at implementing institutions to ensure sustainability of activities. The \nregional approach of the MBI will seek to support and leverage existing donor PSD activities. \n \n12.  Business  environment  reforms  are  often  complex,  take  many  years,  and  require \nsustained political and policy support. Success of the MBI therefore depends critically on its \nmodality. Key features of the MBI are that it will be demand driven, enable ADB to rapidly \nmobilize targeted expertise in response to requests for assistance,8 and have in-built flexibility to \ndisengage and change focus as circumstances require.9 The MBI will support reform agendas \nbeing driven within CLMV by working with multiple stakeholders, particularly the private sector. \nThe MBI aims to take novel approaches, so some of the initiatives pursued will be experimental. \nAccordingly, the MBI will develop a monitoring and evaluation framework that allows close \nmonitoring of projects, strategic exits, and learning. \n \n13.  The initiative will engage closely with Thailand and the People\u2019s Republic of China \nthrough the GMS Business Forum.10 The MBI will also seek partnerships with strong regional \n                                                \n7  International Finance Corporation. 2013.

However, if reforms stall in one country, the MBI has \nthe flexibility to shift resources to the other countries where reform is progressing faster.  Country portfolio \nperformance will be monitored regularly. \n9  ADB and the Government of Australia have successfully partnered to design and implement this type of TA in the \nPacific region (Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative \u2013 phases 1, 2, and 3). \n10  Specifically, Yunnan Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which are part of the GMS. \n ", "4   \nand global institutions promoting good business practices, and transfer knowledge from ASEAN \neconomies outside of the GMS, as well as global best practices. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The expected impact will be increased business formalization and growth in regional \nvalue  chains  in  CLMV  as  measured  by  an  increase  in  (i)  the  number  of  new  companies \nregistered and (ii) the percentage of SMEs that export. The expected outcome will be an \nimproved  business-enabling  environment  in  CLMV  as  measured  by  rankings  of  selected \nindicators such as the ASEAN SME policy index. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  Output  1:  Improved  business  regulation  environment  that  supports  regional \nharmonization and small and medium-sized enterprises integration into global supply-\nchains. MBI activities include the following: First, business regulation diagnostics in CLMV are \ndeveloped  in  consultation  with  all  key  stakeholders  to  assess  impediments  to  business \nformalization  and  growth,  with  particular  attention  on  women-led  SMEs.11 Diagnostics  will \nbenchmark regulatory gaps between CLMV business laws and international best practice, as \nwell as implementation gaps. Second, independent and high-quality policy analysis is provided \nto the GMS Business Forum and national business associations for increasing awareness of \npolicy issues and strengthening their capacity to advocate for change. Third, the capacity of \nbusiness  associations  (with  particular  attention  on  women-led  business  associations)  is \nstrengthened to support SMEs through dissemination of SME-friendly materials on business \ndevelopment support. Fourth, and subject to demand, the MBI will further (i) support the drafting \nof selected business laws  that incentivize business formalization and are  harmonized with \nregional standards, principles, and codes; (ii) build the capacity of institutions responsible for \nenforcing these regulations; (iii) promote the provision of regional public goods where CLMV \ncurrently lack the capacity or resources for national institutions; and (iv) support adoption of \ninnovative  approaches  to  extending  the  benefits  of  business  regulation  reforms  to  SMEs, \nparticularly women-led SMEs, both in the formal and informal sectors. \n \n16.  Output 2: Better-functioning national and regional markets for financial services \nto small and medium-sized enterprises.  This includes regulatory diagnostics of SME access \nto  financial  services,  including  gender  dimensions,  in  CLMV  to  inform  MBI  technical  and \nadvocacy activities.12 It involves extensive stakeholder consultations and engagements with \npolicymakers. To create a more conducive environment for SME access to finance, subject to \ndemand, the MBI will (i) draft or revise financial laws and regulations, (ii) install or upgrade \nalternative  secured  transaction  registries,  and  (iii)  implement  secured  transaction  lending, \nthrough both supply- and demand-side measures. \n \n17.  Output 3: Improved provision of strategic and knowledge management services. \nMBI activities include (i) awareness campaigns to promote the MBI to potential beneficiaries; \n(ii) communication via social media and online platforms to disseminate knowledge generated \n                                                \n11 The MBI will implement an in-depth examination of the \u201cbusiness informality issue\u201d in CLMV, including an \nassessment of its causes and costs, and identification of possible MBI activities to overcome it. \n12 The Government of Australia is financing the United Nations Capital Development Fund through the Shaping \nInclusive Finance Transformations in ASEAN program. While the MBI primarily supports regulatory reforms that \nimprove the enabling environment for SME access to finance, the program works with providers to promote and \npilot new SME-friendly financial products. ADB will therefore closely work with the fund as the two programs are \nhighly complementary with much scope for collaboration. MBI however will not cross-subsidize SHIFT activities. \n ", "  5 \nby the MBI; (iii) analytic work to identify and prioritize TA activities and support integration of \nPSD  issues  into  ADB  regional  and  country  programming,  including  policy-based  loans; \n(iv) annual bulletins describing issues and outcomes of the MBI initiatives with key findings and \nlessons to be disseminated through knowledge-sharing workshops, including on gender issues, \nand both printed and social media; (v) regular private sector roundtables to foster discussions \nbetween  public  and  private  stakeholders  on  MBI  focus  areas;  (vi)  regular  participation  in \nregional and international conferences to discuss findings and best practices; and (vii) a 3-year \nmonitoring and evaluation framework, including annual performance targets, to track progress of \nall MBI initiatives, with results aggregated and analyzed in an annual MBI progress report. The \nMBI  will  also  respond to  requests for  knowledge  support from governments  and  business \nassociations on PSD issues of strategic importance.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $10.5 million, of which $10.0 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of Australia13 and $0.5 million will be financed on a grant basis \nby  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  Cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency. A project administration unit will be placed in the Viet \nNam Resident Mission and be responsible for managing the TA. Annually, ADB will organize a \ndevelopment partner consultation session to review progress and accomplishments from the \nprevious year.  Following on from this ADB and the Government of Australia will convene a \nstrategic planning workshop to agree on strategic directions of the MBI work program for the \nyear  ahead.  In  light  of  its  complexity,  the  MBI  will  require  11  long-term  consultants  (six \ninternational for 195 person-months, and five national for 167 person-months), who will be hired \nthrough  individual  consultant  selection  to  provide  flexibility  and  ensure  quality  during  the \nrecruitment process. Additionally, short-term consultants (an estimated 82 person-months of \ninternational  consultants  and  40  person-months  of  national  consultants)  will  be  hired. \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  MBI  operations  manual  details \nimplementation arrangements (Supplementary Appendix H). The MBI will be implemented from \nDecember 2014 to November 2017. Australia has indicated that it would consider a possible \nextension of the TA subject to sufficient reform momentum and results generated during this \nperiod. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $10,000,000 for the Mekong Business \nInitiative, to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia. If the Board approves \nADB administering the technical assistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated \nby the Board, approves ADB providing the balance of the technical assistance not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis, for the Mekong Business Initiative. \n                                                \n13 Through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) between the \nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Asian Development Bank. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2022:    Assumption \nIncreased business  Number of companies  Company registries  Sustained government \nformalization and  registered, including SMEs,    commitment and \ngrowth in global value  increased in CLMV  Enterprise surveys  contribution to regional \nchains in CLMV.
