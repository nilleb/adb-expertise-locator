INTRODUCTION \n1.  Since 2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and the World Health \nOrganization (WHO)1 have been laying the groundwork for creation of an Asia Pacific Health \nObservatory that will collect and analyze information and research evidence on health systems, \npolicies and reforms in the region. The European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies \nserves as a model for this initiative.2 The World Bank has shared its experience as a partner of \nthe European observatory. WHO\u2019s Western Pacific Regional Office has established a small unit \nand allocated resources to prepare the observatory. ADB has provided small-scale technical \nassistance3 (TA)  to  support  the  publication  of  two  policy  briefs  as  pilot  products  of  the \nobservatory, and to organize regional workshops with representatives of ministries of health, the \nresearch community, and development partners, all of whom are expected to be stakeholders of \nthe observatory. \n \n2.  At a stakeholder preparatory workshop held in Bangkok in October 2010, participants \nreached  agreement  on  the  governance  structure  of  the  observatory  and  on  criteria  and \nconditions for membership (including a minimum financial contribution from steering committee \nmembers).  WHO  has  been  requested  to  finalize  the  legal  documents  necessary  for  the \nestablishment of the observatory, which is expected to be formally launched in February 2011. \nThe proposed TA will enable ADB to support the observatory.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Health systems everywhere must constantly adapt to evolving conditions. New health \npolicies and reforms are regularly needed, for example, because of changes in the burden of \ndiseases  and  new  demands  from  the  public  linked  to  economic  development  and  aging \npopulations.  While  economic  development  has  enabled  better  control  of  traditional \ncommunicable diseases, new communicable and noncommunicable diseases are emerging as \na consequence of people\u2019s mobility, climate change, urbanization, and changing lifestyles. New \ndrugs and medical devices improve service quality but also have an impact on the cost of health \nservices. Innovative ways of delivering health services can improve cost-efficiency. Government \nrestructuring,  such  as  decentralization,  often  requires  redefining  rules  and  regulations  (for \nexample,  relations  between  the  center  and  the  regions)  with  an  overarching  objective  to \nmaintain service quality and equity in access.  \n \n4.   Governments in neighboring countries often face similar issues, and sharing information \nand experiences can help authorities adopt new health policies based on evidence and lessons \nidentified. As the European observatory\u2019s experience has shown, two kinds of studies are \nparticularly useful: (i) description and analysis of a country\u2019s health system following a template \nthat allows comparisons between countries (\u201cdescriptions of health systems in transition\u201d); and \n(ii) analysis of selected health policy issues across countries in the region (\u201cpolicy briefs\u201d).  \n \n5.  The objective of the observatory is to present and disseminate information that will help \ngovernments  adopt  evidence-based  effective  and  efficient  health  policies,  and  to  facilitate \nregional collaboration and integration in Asia and the Pacific. The observatory will produce and \n                                                 \n1  Both the Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regional offices of WHO have been involved in discussions on \ncreating an Asia Pacific Health Observatory. \n2  The  European  Observatory  was  established  in  1998.  http://www.euro.who.int/en/home/projects/observatory  - \nhttp://www2.lse.ac.uk/LSEHealthAndSocialCare/LSEHealth/europeanObservatoryOnHealthCareSystems.aspx  \n3  ADB. 2009.

At the Bangkok workshop, participants5 reached agreement on the observatory\u2019s terms \nof  reference.  It  will  be  a  collaborative  partnership  of  interested  governments,  international \nagencies, foundations, nongovernment organizations, and the research community. A steering \ncommittee will provide the strategic direction of the observatory, guiding its work and monitoring \nperformance. Governments and international agencies that want to be members of the steering \ncommittee will need to make a minimum annual cash contribution of $100,000.6 Research \ninstitutions that want to be members of the steering committee will be expected to provide an \nannual in-kind contribution (staff time or facilities) equivalent to $100,000. \n \n7.  The secretariat of the observatory will be located initially in the Western Pacific regional \noffice of WHO. WHO will serve as the managing agent of the observatory, bearing responsibility \nfor legal and administrative issues. From a legal point of view, the observatory will be a WHO \nprogram,  and  all  activities  carried  out  by  the  observatory  will  adhere  to  WHO  rules  and \nregulations. Contributions to the observatory (by steering committee members or others) will \neither be pooled or administered separately under a specific agreement between the donor and \nWHO. While the observatory will be legally and administratively a WHO program, the proposed \ngovernance structure, with a steering committee involving governments, development partners \nand the research community, will make it a dynamic and consultative program. \n \n8.  The observatory will generate and disseminate intelligence on health, identifying gaps \nand good practices in health sectors at both country and regional levels. For example, regional \ncollaboration is required to address emerging regional health threats adequately. Preventing \ncommunicable diseases, which do not respect borders, is a regional public good, that require \nregional  collaboration  including  sharing  of  information  and  coordination  of  responses. \nInfrastructure development, one of ADB core activity areas, facilitates regional integration and \nbrings significant economic benefits, but the increased trade and mobility that can result can \nexacerbate regional health threats, such as communicable diseases (severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome, avian influenza, HIV/AIDS, and other emerging infectious diseases), food safety \nproblems (foodborne diseases and inadequate food quality control), and poor quality or fake \nmedicines. These regional health threats can have serious negative impacts on the economy \nand societal well-being. \n \n9.  In response to severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza outbreaks in \nparticular, ADB has worked with WHO to stimulate regional coordination and collaboration \namong ministries of health and with other sector ministries. Similar cooperation with the private \nsector  remains  underdeveloped  at  the  regional  level.  The  private  sector,  which  was \neconomically affected by the recent health crises in the region, has developed its own expertise \nin risk management and planning for business continuity. A public\u2013private partnership (PPP) for \nregional health security\u2014building on the ADB partnership with WHO for the prevention and \ncontrol of avian influenza, and informed by a dialogue between governments and businesses\u2014\nwould complement the observatory. Regular consultations with the private sector can improve \n                                                 \n5  Participants included representatives from ADB, the World Bank, the World Health Organization; ministries of \nhealth, the research community of Asia and the Pacific, and development partners. \n6  Hong Kong, China; the Philippines; Singapore; and Thailand have already indicated their readiness to contribute \n$100,000 each. \n ", "  3\nhealth-related  policy  making  and  regional  health  security.  Benefits  would  accrue  to  the \npopulation at large. \n \n10.  In  collaboration  with  WHO,  ADB  organized  a  regional  workshop  on  public\u2013private \ncollaboration on regional health security in July 2010 in Shanghai. Participants included senior \nrepresentatives of multinational enterprises working in Asia and the Pacific. The objective of the \nworkshop  was  to  explore  private  sector  interest  in  establishing  a  PPP  for  regional  health \nsecurity  to  facilitate  dialogue,  share  information  and  experience  at  the  regional  level,  and \nmobilize private sector resources to strengthen surveillance, early warning systems, and the \nresponse capacity of national health systems to health threats. Private sector participants in the \nworkshop expressed interest in this initiative, but requested a detailed needs assessment and \ngap analysis from WHO. Participants proposed organizing a follow-up regional workshop in \nSingapore. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcomes \n11.  The TA will help to improve the health of the populations of Asia and the Pacific. The \nobjective of the observatory is to collect and disseminate health-related information and good \npractices that will help governments adopt new health policies and reforms based on evidence. \nImproved health systems will guarantee more effective delivery of, and more equitable access \nto, health services. Effective health systems must also be able to address emerging health \nthreats and reinforce both national and regional health security.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   The TA has two components: the main component will provide support to the Asia \nPacific Health Observatory, the other will follow up on an ADB\u2013WHO initiative to involve the \nprivate sector in a PPP for regional heath security. \n \n13.  The  observatory,  developed  on  the  model  of  the  European  Observatory  on  Health \nSystems  and  Policies,  will  involve  governments,  development  partners,  and  the  research \ncommunity  to  generate  and  disseminate  health-related  information  on  health  systems  and \npriority policy issues for the region. By allocating $300,000 for the activities of the observatory,7 \nADB will become a member of the steering committee, thereby participating in the decision-\nmaking  process  and  helping  to  define  the  priority  health  issues  to  be  addressed  by  the \nobservatory and the observatory\u2019s work program for the next 3 years. As a member of the \nsteering committee, ADB will be able to raise issues that it considers important, and to decide, \nin consultation with the other members of the steering committee, how the ADB contribution will \nbe used. Most of the TA resources will be used to finance (i) studies describing national health \nsystems in the region (descriptions of health systems in transition) and analysis addressing \ncommon health policy issues (policy briefs); and (ii) conferences and workshops to disseminate \nstudy results and promote regional and cross-sector coordination and collaboration.  \n \n14.  ADB will also take advantage of the contacts that it established with the private sector in \nAsia in June 2010 in Shanghai to explore how the private sector can participate in the dialogue \namong the various stakeholders interested in improving the functioning of health systems and \n                                                 \n7  This will cover the cost of surveys and studies (estimated at $260,000), administrative costs (estimated at $10,000) \nand contingencies (estimated at $30,000). See Appendix 2. \n ", "4   \naddressing priority health issues in the region effectively. The ADB and WHO PPP initiative \nfocuses on regional health security, which has the potential to benefit all parties. For the private \nsector, it would be an opportunity to express its concerns related to health in the region with the \nmembers of the steering committee of the observatory. A PPP could assist in addressing the \nfindings and recommendations of the various studies generated by the observatory. \n \n15.  In collaboration with WHO, the TA will fund a regional conference in Singapore to follow-\nup on the establishment of a PPP for regional health security. Participants will discuss the \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  a  PPP,  and  identify  resource  mobilization  mechanisms.  The \nprivate sector will help organize the Singapore conference. ADB will allocate up to $200,000 for \nthe conference to cover (i) the engagement of a public relations consultant for 2 person-months, \n(ii) the engagement of one or two workshop facilitators for up to 7 person-days in total, (iii) \nsupport for travel and accommodation of government representatives. The remaining funds \n(from the maximum amount of $200,000 allocated for the workshop) will be allocated to support \nactivities of the observatory.  \n \n16.  In line with the priorities of the ADB operational plan for health under Strategy 2020,8 this \nregional  TA  supports  governance  in  the  health  sector  and  regional  public  goods,  through \npartnerships and through generation and dissemination of knowledge products. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-other sources) for a total amount of $500,000. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency. For the observatory, WHO\u2014as secretariat of the \nobservatory\u2014will be the implementing agency. A TA agreement will be signed between ADB \nand WHO for the implementation of the TA activities related to the observatory. ADB\u2019s Poverty \nReduction,  Gender,  and  Social  Development  Division  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDepartment will be the TA supervising unit. A representative from the TA supervising unit will \nact as ADB\u2019s member of the steering committee, and will oversee the implementation of the TA \nactivities, including oversight of the implementation agreement with WHO.  \n \n19.  The  TA  supervising  unit  will  be  directly  responsible  for  activities  related  to  the \norganization of the regional conference in Singapore to discuss public\u2013private partnership for \nregional health security. The organization of this conference will be coordinated with WHO and \nrepresentatives of the private sector in Singapore. \n \n20.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  for  both  the  observatory  and  the  Singapore \nconference will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  Disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time), possibly using the advance payment and the \nstatement of expenditure procedures. \n \n21.  The TA will start in February 2011 and is expected to be completed by 31 December \n2014. \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2008.
