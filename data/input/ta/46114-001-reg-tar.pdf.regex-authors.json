INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Following the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009, financial stability has become the \nfocus of reforms across the Group of Twenty (G20) and beyond. Even in countries that are less \nglobally integrated, efforts to strengthen macrofinancial stability have become more pressing. In \na  rapidly  globalizing  world,  national  and  international  financial  stability  are  interlinked\u2014\nsupporting a call for strengthening reforms to develop a more effective national framework, \nincluding institution building and capacity development to strengthen financial stability. \n \n2.  In response to the crisis, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) held a series of policy \ndialogues known as the ADB Regional Forum on the Impact of the Global Economic and \nFinancial Crisis, as a platform for developing member countries\u2019 senior policy makers and the \nprivate sector to discuss the implications and measures taken to mitigate the impacts of the \ncrisis and, equally as important, to take stock of the longer term implications for the region. 1 \nThrough these dialogues, developing member countries have sought support from ADB to \ndevelop a policy framework that would enable its member countries to rebuild their institutional \ncapacities to effect necessary reform initiatives, and target interventions that would support \nsustained growth and financial stability. Smaller economies, including Bhutan and the Maldives, \nsought ADB assistance to develop the foundations for monitoring, examining, and addressing \nrisks to financial stability. Such support is expected to translate into a more effective early \nwarning system, including timely recognition of financial vulnerabilities across financial systems. \nIn particular, with improved capacity to monitor external shocks, supervisory and regulatory \nauthorities may adopt timely and appropriate measures to ensure that these shocks do not \nescalate into crises.  \n \n3.  In  this  context,  ADB  commissioned  two  studies  on  developing  a  macrofinancial \nmonitoring and surveillance system for Bhutan and the Maldives in 2010.2 A mission visited \nBhutan and the Maldives in 2011 to present the findings of the studies to the two governments. \nThis was followed by visits in June 2012 to both countries with more detailed discussions with \nsenior officials from the Ministry of Finance and the central banks i.e., the Royal Monetary \nAuthority of Bhutan (RMA) and the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA). The governments and \nthe  mission  reached  an  understanding  on  the  objectives,  scope,  financing  plan,  and \nimplementation details of the technical assistance (TA). The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n      \n4.  Under their financial stability objective, central banks have been mandated to support \nimproved macroeconomic and financial management by developing monitoring and surveillance \nframeworks  based  on  leading  indicators  to  better  understand  shocks  and  transmission \nmechanisms\u2014given the state of the fundamentals\u2014and how to shore up vulnerabilities to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for South Asia Forum on the Impact of the Global Economic and \nFinancial Crisis. Manila (RETA 6508). ADB held a series of policy dialogues across countries in Asia \nand the Pacific in March 2009 and January 2010 in Manila. \n2  In 2010, ADB commissioned two studies on Bhutan and the Maldives: (i) A. Mansur. 2011. Bhutan: \nImpact of the Global Financial Crisis, Improving Monitoring Mechanisms and Maintaining/Strengthening \nCapability for Policy Response. Dhaka: Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh; and (ii)  A. Mansur. \n2011.  Maldives:  Global  Financial  Crisis  and  Vulnerability,  Improving  Monitoring  Mechanism  and \nStrengthening Capability for Policy Response. Dhaka: Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh. A \nfollow-up  mission  to  Bhutan  was held  on  11\u201312 July  and  the Maldives on  12 October 2011,  to \ndisseminate the findings of the studies, leading to the scope and design of this TA. \n ", "2   \nmitigate against any adverse impact on the economy. Proactive policy actions involve the \nformulation of appropriate macroprudential regulations and the ability to monitor and enforce \neffective financial supervision and the impact on the real economy. It also involves active \nliquidity management to ensure that interest rate setting is supportive of price stability and \noverall macrofinancial management considerations. Policy instruments should be developed, \nincluding lender of last resort, discount window, reserve requirements, liquidity rations, and \nappropriate interest rate policy, which serve as intermediate targets to achieve the desirable \npolicy objectives and avoid systemic risks. As such, a central bank\u2019s monetary policy, prudential \nand supervisory roles are complementary and can promote conditions to steer the economy \nback to a stable and steady-state potential growth path over the medium term.  \n \n5.  In South Asia, particularly in the smaller open economies of Bhutan and the Maldives \nwith nascent financial markets, banks dominate the financial system. Like many developing \ncountries that share prevalent (although not universal) features, Bhutan and the Maldives have \ngreater dependence on foreign funding, including development assistance, weaker institutional \nframeworks and market infrastructure, important capacity constraints, greater involvement of the \nstate in the financial system, and greater use of international currencies for domestic financial \ntransactions. In addition, Bhutan follows a currency peg with the Indian rupee while the Maldives \nrecently exited the currency peg with the US dollar and now follows a managed float. Against \nthis backdrop, maintaining economic resilience over the medium term is a major challenge, as \nboth these economies begin to access foreign capital markets and become more integrated with \nthe regional and global economy.  \n \n6.  Financial stability measures for Bhutan and the Maldives are relatively weak as a result \nof data limitations, capacity constraints, and the lack of appropriate policy instruments to carry \nout their respective central bank\u2019s regulatory and supervisory functions. High frequency data are \noften unavailable; the instruments are either inexistent or too blunt, and efforts should be \nconcentrated on developing data along with more refined policy instruments. An example is \ninterest rate setting, whereby in the absence of a deep and sufficiently liquid government \nsecurities  market,  reforms  should  be  introduced  to  develop  an  interest  rate  instrument\u2014\nbeginning at the short end of the yield curve\u2014that effectively prices demand and supply of \novernight, money market, and eventually short-term loanable funds in the market. Monetary \nauthorities are sometimes too passive in their interventions, such as in liquidity management \npractices, whereby some forward indicators can be developed to support more active liquidity \nmanagement. \n \n7.  The proposed TA will assist Bhutan and the Maldives in developing a macroprudential \nframework and a liquidity management plan and strategy, which are important measures for \ndeveloping a regionally coordinated surveillance mechanism to support financial stability across \nSouth  Asia  and  building  on  regional  reform  initiatives  with  other  international  financial \ninstitutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to strengthen banking and \nfinancial systems in South Asia. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA will be stronger financial stability for sustaining growth in Bhutan \nand the Maldives. The outcome of the TA will lead to improved capacity of the RMA and MMA \nfor regulation and supervision of the financial sector.  \n \n ", "    3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will deliver three major outputs:  \n(i)  Developed macroprudential policies, tools, and monitoring framework.3 The \nfirst component will support the RMA and MMA in developing macroprudential \npolicies and framework for monitoring and examining financial soundness. This \nentails (a) a review and conduct of gap analysis of the RMA and MMA\u2019s current \npractices  for  systemic  stability  regulation,  including  assessment  of  staffing \nresources needed for performing financial stability monitoring functions in the \ncentral bank; (b) preliminary study, design, identification, and collection of better \ninformation  and  data  (macroeconomic  and  financial  soundness  indicators)  to \nsupport systemic risk identification and modeling; (c) design of an early warning \nsystem or techniques to identify and measure systemic risk, including stress \ntesting,  following  international  best  practices;  (d)  design  of  appropriate \nmacroprudential instruments; and (e) preparation of guidelines and production of \npilot financial stability reports. \n \n (ii)   Improved liquidity management plan and strategy. The second component \nwill assist the RMA and MMA in developing a liquidity management plan and \nstrategy. This entails (a) review and conduct of a needs assessment of present \nliquidity  measurement  and  management  in  Bhutan  and  the  Maldives, \n(b) development of an effective liquidity management plan, which covers liquidity \nrisk management policy and liquidity management strategy in the context of \nBhutan and the Maldives; and (c) preparation of a road map to implement the \nliquidity management plan and strategy in a phased manner.  \n \n(iii)   Enhanced capacity and training of central bank staff in performing financial \nstability  functions.  The  third  component  will  provide  resources  to  support \ncapacity  building  of  key  central  bank  staff  in  performing  the  functions  of \nmacroprudential regulation and liquidity management. This entails (a) capacity \nand training needs assessment; (b) development of detailed training manuals on \nthe preparation of financial stability reports; (c) design of a training manual for the \nnew liquidity management strategy; and (d) conduct of in-house training program \nfor key central bank staff on macroprudential monitoring, stress testing, and \nliquidity management. \n \n10.  It is assumed that the governments of Bhutan and the Maldives will continue to give high \npriority to support regulation and supervision practices and make available relevant data and \nstaff resources for the implementation of the outlined outputs and corresponding activities. The \nteam of international consultants hired under this TA will work in both countries\u2014with national \nconsultants\u2014to build a common approach to TA deliverables and ensure cost-effectiveness. A \nmajor risk is the lack of commitment from the central bank to introduce and apply financial \nstability  mechanisms,  i.e.,  macroprudential  policies  and  monitoring,  and  an  active  liquidity \nmanagement strategy to their regulatory and supervisory functions. In addition, failure to recruit \nand/or retain the necessary senior level staff to work with international experts on various \ninitiatives, as designed under the TA, is another risk.   \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n m   e m   b  e  r s  ,  B   o a  r d    o  f   D  i r e  c t o  r s  ,   M  a  nagement, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n3  The output of this TA will support ADB\u2019s proposed intervention in Bhutan on Strengthening Economic Management \nProgram for improved macroprudential and financial sector management to meet tranche policy conditions.  The \nproposed TA also complements ADB\u2019s upcoming intervention in Bhutan on capital market development.  \n ", "4   \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nFinancial Sector Development Partnership Fund4 and administered by ADB. The governments \nof Bhutan and the Maldives will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, use \nof office facilities for consultants and other in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will be the executing agency, and the RMA and MMA will be the implementing \nagencies. The implementing agencies will provide furnished office space for the consultants, \naccess to a conference room, and local communication facilities for the consultants. Both the \nRMA and MMA will provide counterpart staff as necessary. \n \n13.  To  achieve  the  planned  outcome,  three  international  consultants  and  two  national \nconsultants will be recruited under one consulting firm to provide a total of 28 person-months of \nconsulting  services.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3. \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). For training and workshops, the advance payment facility could be used.   \n \n14.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  intermittently  over  24  months,  from  February  2013  to \nFebruary 2015. The consulting firm will submit to the RMA, MMA, and ADB the following: \n(i) inception reports 2 weeks after commencement of consulting services; (ii) interim progress at \nappropriate stages during TA implementation; (iii) draft final reports before the conclusion of the \ncontract; and (iv) final reports after receiving comments from the RMA, MMA, and ADB. Major \nproject activities will be regularly monitored and reported on by the RMA, MMA, and ADB \nadministration missions. The inception report and finalization of the draft final reports will be \ndiscussed at tripartite meetings involving the RMA, MMA, the consultants, and ADB. \n \nIV.
