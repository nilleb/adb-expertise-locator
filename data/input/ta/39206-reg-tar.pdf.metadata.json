This  encouraged  a  number  of  donor-financed  trust  funds  to  help  ADB \naccelerate the implementation of commitments made in the PRS. Two such trust funds are the \nCooperation  Fund  in  Support  of  the  Formulation  and  Implementation  of  National  Poverty \nReduction  Strategies  (NPRS)  financed  by  the  Netherlands  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  (the \nNetherlands) and the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund (PRF) financed by the Department \nfor  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom.  As  the \nimplementation of these two funds advances, donors, ADB, and the stakeholders in ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) see the need for (i) a systematic approach to capture, \nsynthesize, enhance, and disseminate the knowledge and experience gathered through projects \nfinanced by these funds; and (ii) feedback loops to the operations in DMCs. These were also \nraised by DFID and the Netherlands during the two semiannual strategy meetings on NPRS and \nPRF in late 2004 and early 2005, and in an independent PRF midterm review by DFID.1 \n \n2.  In response, a concept paper for regional technical assistance (RETA) to strengthen the \nknowledge management of grant-based pro-poor initiatives was developed and endorsed during \nan ADB-wide peer review meeting in August 2005.2 The donors endorsed the impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. \nThe technical assistance (TA) design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The NPRS was established in November 2001 as a multidonor fund, with an initial \ncontribution of Dutch guilders 15.0 million (about $7.4 million4) from the Netherlands Ministry of \nForeign Affairs. The initial contribution is almost fully committed. The NPRS finances 20 TA \nprojects  which  help  DMCs  formulate,  prioritize,  implement,  monitor,  and  reformulate  their \nrespective  national  poverty  reduction  strategies.  The  NPRS  program  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by January 2008. \n \n4.  The PRF was established in July 2002 as a multidonor fund, with an initial contribution of \n\u20a439 million (about $69 million [footnote 4]) from DFID. Of that amount, \u20a49 million (about $16 \nmillion) was earmarked for People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and is technically managed by \nADB\u2019s PRC Resident Mission in collaboration with DFID-China. The Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department  (RSDD)  manages  part  of  the  PRF  jointly  with  the  NPRS5.  PRF \ncurrently  finances  about  100  TA  projects  amounting  to  $51  million.  These  projects  will \nstrengthen ADB\u2019s poverty focus in policy dialogue and lending operations in DMCs. The PRF \nprogram is scheduled to be completed by March 2008. \n \n5.  PRF and NPRS have a significant potential contribution to ADB\u2019s overall learning of \neffective poverty reduction. PRF and NPRS jointly support about 120 TA projects to date, and \nwill support about 140 TA projects by early 2006 when fully committed. These projects cover \n                                                 \n1 Social Development Direct. 2005. Review of the ADB Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund (PRF) Regional \nWindow.  Department for International Development and the Asian Development Bank. London. \n2 The Vice-President Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development cleared the concept paper on 20 April \n2005. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 26 May 2005. \n4  As of 30 June 2005. \n5 Since the establishment of the PRF, selection, processing, administration and monitoring of activities under the \nNPRS and PRF have been carried out by RSDD. \n ", "2   \nnearly all sectors and thematic areas, and assist most of ADB\u2019s operational6 and knowledge \nmanagement departments. The list of NPRS and PRF projects is in Appendix 2. These projects \ncan be grouped according to the following topics:  \n \n(i)  Influencing policies and strategies, including national poverty reduction strategies \nor national development plans and sector policies/thematic strategies; \n(ii)  Measuring poverty reduction impacts of government policies and ADB projects; \n(iii)  Piloting socially inclusive, participatory and gender-responsive project designs; \n(iv)  Supporting pro-poor governance and the poor\u2019s access to justice; \n(v)  Supporting public-private partnership for poverty and vulnerability reduction; \n(vi)  Identifying ways to reduce vulnerability to risks and shocks or addressing the \nimpact of shocks and conflicts; \n(vii)  Better  understanding  and  addressing  regional  poverty  issues  under  the \nsubregional economic cooperation schemes; \n(viii)  Supporting poverty reduction specialists who are based in resident missions; \n(ix)  Developing pro-poor infrastructure services and policies; and  \n(x)  Building  the  capacity  of  DMCs  in  understanding  poverty,  and  developing, \nimplementing, monitoring, and/or evaluating pro-poor policies and projects. \n \n6.  NPRS and PRF both focus on learning and innovation, and have been encouraging the \nearmarking part of the budget for knowledge management in each TA. Knowledge management \nincludes stakeholder discussion on how to scale-up TA experience to a larger and sustainable \ninitiative. It also involves the dissemination of research findings, policy recommendations and \nlessons learned from pilot activities. Some of the NPRS- and PRF-financed TAs which have \nstarted in 2002 are now gradually providing a body of knowledge. However, such knowledge \nand lessons learned from individual TAs have not been systematically documented, assessed, \nand synthesized in line with a strategic framework provided by the two funds. Neither have they \nbeen fed back to the broader community of practice in ADB, DMCs, development researchers \nand practitioners.  Knowledge and experience usually remain with individual project officers in \nADB, consultants, and DMCs, and are not captured as institutional learning.   \n \n7.  Experience indicates that systematic and strategic knowledge management requires \nconscious planning at the onset. Preparation involves determining the types of knowledge to be \ngathered and the policy advice to be delivered to stakeholders, and carefully following through \nduring and after TA implementation. Without this, the strategic objective of the two funds (i.e., \ninfluencing DMC policies, ADB\u2019s country strategies, project designs, and capacity of DMCs and \nADB  in  accelerating  poverty  reduction)  will  not  be  achieved.  There  are  already  worrying \nindications. Case studies under a recently completed independent midterm review of the PRF \n(footnote 1) show emerging evidence that the initial focus on \"changes\", whether they are DMC \npolicies, country strategies, new loan designs, or capacity, lessens during the implementation \nperiod.  \n \n8.  Some attempts have been made towards knowledge management in projects financed \nby the two funds. However, a major challenge lies in ADB\u2019s current capacity. Assistance offered \nby the NPRS-PRF secretariat in RSDD7 to project officers in departments and resident missions \nis limited, as is the assistance that project officers offer to in-country stakeholders. This has \nresulted  in  the  following:  First,  the  knowledge  product  thus  far  has  been  confined  to  key \nconsultant reports (both published and unpublished) produced under each TA. These bulky \n                                                 \n6 The NPRS is open to all DMCs while the PRF is open to Group A, B1 and B2 countries excluding India, and \nIndonesia. \n7  One coordinator (staff, part time) and two support staff (one contractual analyst and one operations assistant). \nMost of their time is spent on technically and logistically assisting new intakes and preparing reports to donors.  \n ", "  3\nreports  need  to  be  converted  into  a  more  accessible  and  succinct  format  for  effective \ndissemination. A series of analytical synthesis papers that compile and reassess the case \nstudies may serve as a useful tool for influencing policy dialogue in DMCs. It will also provide a \nmore systematic understanding of particular topical or sectoral aspects of poverty reduction \nwhich involves cross-country comparison. \n \n9.  Second, NPRS and PRF TA projects\u2019 knowledge feedback to key country stakeholders \nhas  been  constrained  by  the  lack  of  in-country  follow-ups  after  TA  completion.  The \ntransformation of TA-based knowledge into the next level of policy and program discussion \nwithin ADB (i.e., integration into country strategy and programs or annual updates) and DMCs \n(e.g., national poverty reduction strategy, budget framework, and sector policies and projects) is \nnot automatic. To fill this gap, it may be useful to have a clear advocacy plan to determine \nstrategic actions for influencing future policies and projects, and to choose the appropriate in-\ncountry  partners.  In-country  post-TA  stakeholder  workshops  may  be  useful  to  sustain  the \nmomentum of the TA and encourage follow-up actions. Resident missions can potentially play a \nsignificant role in this, especially through country-based domestic poverty reduction consultants \nfinanced by the NPRS and PRF. Their current capacity, however, is limited to project-by-project \nsupport. Strategic policy dialogue capacity needs to be developed among them.     \n \n10.  Third, the efforts to reach a broader community of practice have been limited.  ADB\u2019s \nexternal website8 is so far the only channel used for the dissemination of knowledge and \ninnovation under the NPRS-PRF. However, use of the website as a source of knowledge is not \nwidely known.  A more proactive media approach in collaboration with the Department of \nExternal Relations (DER) is necessary. Linking with globally reputable development knowledge \ngateways  as  well  as  academic  and  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  communication \nnetworks, and private sector knowledge partners is also urgently required. Bringing country-\nspecific experience to state-of-the-art regional or global discussion on poverty reduction is also \nneeded and should be proactively supported from the perspective of country ownership.  \n \n11.  Fourth, while the responsibility for individual TA implementation lies with project officers \nand  their  departments,  experiences  thus  far  show  that  critical  moments  of  opportunity  for \ninfluencing the stakeholders and their decisions are often missed.  A third monitoring party such \nas the NPRS-PRF secretariat should keep track of progress and provide responsive help desk \nsupport. ADB is currently developing a portfolio management database that is expected to \nfacilitate  the  monitoring  of  critical  paths.  Other  types  of  knowledge  databases  such  as \ninformation about implementing partners and individuals, as well as procedural matters are all \nimportant sources of institutional knowledge. The refinement, maintenance, and day-to-day \nmanagement of these databases need to be strengthened.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The expected impact of the RETA is the strengthened influence of NPRS-PRF-financed \nTAs  on  the  pro-poor  emphasis  in  DMC  policies  and  projects.  The  expected  outcome  is \nstrengthened awareness and institutional capacity of ADB and DMCs in utilizing knowledge \ngenerated through NPRS-PRF TAs for pro-poor policy and project development.   \n \n                                                 \n8 The NPRS website located at http://www.adb.org/nprs. The PRF website is located at http://www.adb.org/prf. Each \nwebsite contains individual TA sites that feature project summaries and links to key media reports and TA outputs. \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities9 \n13.  Various tools will be tested under the RETA to identify effective ways of knowledge \nsharing. Their effectiveness will be evaluated at the end of the RETA. Each knowledge product \nand activity will target either or both of the following: (i) in-country policy makers and the \nstakeholders that influence their decisions (e.g., NGOs, donors including ADB, etc.); and (ii) \nbroader community of practice. \n \n14.  Knowledge Product Development. The following knowledge products will be produced \nand disseminated: (i) a series of case studies on NPRS-PRF in a user friendly format; (ii) \nthematic and/or sectoral synthesis papers that place individual NPRS-PRF case studies into a \nconceptual framework on poverty reduction set out by ADB\u2019s Enhanced PRS; (iii) ADB Review \nand a series of Media Center articles; (iv) academic articles in refereed journals (for which \nexternal reviewers will be identified and provided to enhance quality); and (v) other products as \ndeemed necessary and useful (e.g., e-newsletter, toolkit). About 80 short case writings (1\u20132 \npages) will be prepared primarily based on the desk review of key TA outputs, but about 15 of \nthem  will  have  more  in-depth  case  studies  containing  in-country  interviews  with  key \nstakeholders and beneficiaries involved. The synthesis papers may include collection of and \ncomparison with other similar approaches applied in ADB operations, loan or grants, especially \nthose supported by other trust funds. \n \n15.  In-Country Knowledge Feedback and Institutionalization. Except for item iii, ADB will \nprovide the following support services on a demand basis: (i) advisory support to project officers \nand TA teams, during or post-TA period, in developing advocacy strategy for convincingly \ncommunicating the TA results to key stakeholders in the country; (ii) support to in-country \nfollow-up workshops or training during the post-TA period to strengthen institutionalization of \nknowledge; (iii) annual exchange among resident mission-based poverty reduction specialists \nand other relevant national officers to ensure they can effectively follow up policy dialogue and \non poverty reduction; and (iv) additional translation and in-country publication support for TAs \nwith no budget allocation for such items. This will be done to complement the gaps in the \nknowledge management component of existing TAs under the NPRS-PRF, and to assist the \ncapacity in ADB\u2019s operational departments and resident missions to strategically bring the TA \nknowledge and experience up to the next level of policy dialogue. If there is expressed interest, \nADB will also provide technical support to pilot RMs (about four) in developing poverty-related \ninstitutional knowledge database arising from ADB\u2019s poverty-focused programs.  \n \n16.  Reaching a Broader Community of Practice. The following will be carried out to \nexpand dissemination to a broader community of practices, including regional and international \nacademic  institutions,  consultants,  civil  society  organizations,  private  enterprises,  and \nfinanciers:  (i)  proactive  media  campaign  and  activities  on  NPRS-PRF  good  practices  in \ncooperation  with  DER;  (ii)  expansion  of  dissemination  channels  by  developing  links  with \nreputable  development  knowledge  and  NGO  networks;  (iii)  support  for  sending  country \nstakeholders (e.g., government officials, NGO implementing agencies, beneficiaries) to relevant \ninternational meetings to widely disseminate NPRS-PRF good practices and experience; and \n(iv) a three-day regional conference in Manila in the third quarter of 2007 to organize and \ndisseminate key knowledge and lessons learned from the NPRS-PRF. Close collaboration with \nthe ADB Institute (ADBI) will be explored for the Manila conference.  \n \n                                                 \n9  The  key  activities  under  the  RETA  are  based  on  the  needs  expressed  by  the  project  officers  and  the \nrecommendations made in the PRF review (para. 7).  \n ", "  5\n17.  Knowledge  Management  System  and  Program  Management.  This  component \nincludes various system and database development and maintenance as well as day-to-day \nportfolio tracking and knowledge management activities. A detailed media and communication \nprogram for NPRS-PRF will be developed in close collaboration with DER.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $980,000 and will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund administered by ADB. The cost estimate and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the RETA. To ensure knowledge management is a \ncore part of the funds\u2019 management, the NPRS-PRF secretariat in RSDD\u2019s Gender, Social \nDevelopment,  and  Civil  Society  Division  will  serve  as  the  RETA  secretariat.  The  RETA \nsecretariat will be supported by a team of consultants and will work closely with NPRS-PRF \nproject officers in various departments in ADB. It will provide advisory functions to them and the \nkey stakeholders within their TAs. The RETA will be carried out in close collaboration with \nADB\u2019s operational departments and resident missions (especially domestic poverty reduction \nspecialists and external relations officers), Knowledge Management Center, Poverty Unit, NGO \nand Civil Society Center, Economics and Research Department, DER, Office of Information \nSystems and Technology, ADBI, and other relevant departments and offices. An NPRS-PRF \npeer review committee will continue to assist the RETA in selecting on-demand activities and \ntopics for synthesis papers. \n \n20.  The RETA will require about 24 person-months of international and about 45 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants. Under Part A: Knowledge Product Development, a team of \nconsultants will be recruited through a firm following the quality- and cost-based selection \nprocess using the simplified technical proposal. The remaining RETA consultants in Part B: \nKnowledge Management Program Coordination will be recruited on an individual basis. Some of \nthe positions needed are: (i) poverty reduction knowledge program coordinator, (ii) poverty \nreduction specialists (case and synthesis writers), (iii) communications and media liaison, (iv) \nknowledge management program evaluators, and (v) technical analysts. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The outline \nterms of reference of consultants are in Appendix 4. One laptop computer and standard office \nsoftware will be provided in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from January 2006 to December 2007.  \nOutputs under the TA will be posted on the NPRS-PRF webpages under ADB\u2019s external poverty \nwebsite and on other relevant dissemination channels. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $980,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for Facilitating Knowledge Management \nfor Pro-Poor Policies and Projects, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased pro-poor  At least 30% of NPRS- Evaluation of NPRS-PRF  \u2022  Sufficient number of \nemphasis in DMC  PRF TAs have  (scheduled in late 2007)  successful NPRS-PRF \npolicies and projects  introduced new pro- which will examine:  TAs \ninfluenced by  NPRS- poor aspects to policies  \u2022  DMCs\u2019 strategic  Risk \nPRF-financed TAs   or projects in DMCs   documents  \u2022  Discontinuation of \n\u2022  Practices of supported  dominance of pro-poor \nExecuting Agencies  development paradigm  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened  \u2022  Number of cases  Evaluation of NPRS-PRF  \u2022  ADB management \nawareness and  where knowledge  and RETA consultant report  provides strong \ninstitutional capacity of  gathered from    incentives to KM, \nADB and DMCs in  NPRS-PRF  including staff time \nutilizing knowledge  financed TAs  \u2022  DMC governments are \ngenerated through  contributed to  receptive to changes \nNPRS-PRF TAs for  influencing policies  \u2022  Majority of NPRS-PRF \npro-poor policy and  and projects  projects are completed \nproject development   \u2022  Number of page  on time \nhits in NPRS-PRF   \nexternal websites \nand ADB portal \n\u2022  Number of \nsuccessful cases \nand KM \napproaches piloted \nunder the RETA \n \nOutputs  By December 2007    Assumptions \n      \u2022  ADB and DMC senior \n1.

The regional technical assistance (RETA) will be implemented in close consultation with \nproject officers in various departments in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) who manage the \ntechnical assistance (TA) projects financed by the two ADB-administered poverty reduction trust \nfunds\u2014i.e., the Cooperation Fund in Support of the Formulation and Implementation of National \nPoverty  Reduction  Strategies  (NPRS  Fund)  and  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund \n(PRF). Close coordination will be also required with many other departments and individuals in \nthe ADB headquarters in Manila and ADB resident missions (RM). Overall guidance to the \nRETA will be provided by the NPRS-PRF coordinator in the NPRS-PRF secretariat in ADB\u2019s \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD).  \n \n2.  The  consulting  services  will  be  packaged  in  two  parts.  For  Knowledge  Product \nDevelopment (Part A), a team of international and domestic consultants will be recruited through \na firm. For Knowledge Management Program Coordination (Part B), one international and one \ndomestic consultant will be recruited on an individual basis. The overall coordination between \nPart A and Part B will be carried out by the poverty reduction advocacy program coordinator \nwho will be recruited under Part B under the guidance of ADB\u2019s NPRS-PRF secretariat.   \n \nA.  Part A: Knowledge Product Development \n3.  ADB will engage an international consulting firm that has a track record in poverty \nreduction and social development. The consultants should have demonstrated excellence in \nproducing analytical reports and/or case studies on poverty reduction, pro-poor policies and \nstrategies,  pro-poor  economic  growth,  inclusive  gender  and  social  development,  pro-poor \ngovernance, and other relevant topics. Global and regional knowledge on good practices on \nthese topics, especially in Asia and the Pacific Region, is a major advantage. Persuasive and \nsuccinct  writing  skills  are  a  must.  Consultants  must  be  able  to  link  micro  level  empirical \nevidence and macro level conceptual framework. \n \n4.  Part A covers component 1 of the RETA that facilitates ADB and its developing member \ncountries (DMCs) in collecting, documenting, assessing, synthesizing, and disseminating the \nknowledge gathered through two ADB-administered poverty reduction trust funds. About 140 \nindividual TA projects are supported by these funds. From these, the RETA will support those \nwith high learning values both for ADB and DMCs. Primary data source for knowledge products \ndevelopment  is  the  key  consultant  reports  prepared  by  individual  TA  projects  financed  by \nNPRS-PRF. It will be complemented by visits to selected countries and ADB headquarters in \nManila. Other ADB poverty-focused interventions would be also included under the synthesis \npapers, as necessary, to strengthen the substantiation of the general recommendations under \nthe synthesis papers.  \n \n5.  The key outputs include the following:     \n(i)  At least 80 short case studies (about 1-2 pages each) for website posting (initial \n50 by month 12 and remaining 30 by month 18). \n(ii)  Publication-ready version of about 15 long in-depth case studies (about 10 pages \neach),  involving  focal  country  trips  for  consultations  with  ADB  and  country \nstakeholders and beneficiaries (initial 10 by month 12, remaining 5 by month 18).  \n(iii)  Publication-ready version of six thematic or topical synthesis papers (about 50 \npages each, including synthesis analysis and recommendations and 3\u20134 case \nstudies, initial 3 by month 12, remaining 3 by month 18).   \n ", "  Appendix 4  15 \n(iv)  Publication-ready version of one overall NPRS-PRF synthesis paper (about 50 \npages) based on all the above (draft by month 18). \n(v)  Assistance to project officers and DMC counterparts in preparing about 20 media \narticles (10 by month 12, remaining 10 by month 20).  \n(vi)  Assistance in preparing about 12 draft academic articles and identification of \nrelevant external peer reviewers for each topic (4 by month 12, remaining 8 by \nmonth 24). \n(vii)  Comprehensive inception report including (a) detailed work plan; (b) general \noutline of short-case studies and five trial short case studies; (c) general outline \nof in-depth case studies; and (d) suggested titles for thematic or topical synthesis \nreports and their general outline (end of month 2); brief quarterly progress reports \nhighlighting key achievements vis-\u00e0-vis milestones (months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, \n21, and 24); and final report (month 24).  \n \n6.  About 14 person-months of international and 12 months of domestic consultant inputs \nare expected. A domestic, or Manila-based, consultant will coordinate with the NPRS-PRF \nsecretariat and provide the team with back-stopping support such as collating key documents \nand information available in ADB and engaging in consultations with ADB project officers. Their \nindicative TORs are included below: \n \n1.   Senior  Poverty  Reduction  Specialists\u2013Case  and  Synthesis  Writers \n(international, 2 persons, 7 person-months each) \n \n7.
