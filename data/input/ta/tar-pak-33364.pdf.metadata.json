The TA was \nconfirmed by the Country Program Confirmation Mission in December 2001 and changed to a \nproject preparatory TA.1 This was reconfirmed by the Country Program Mission in March 2002. \nThis TA paper is based on the work of the Fact-Finding Mission that visited Pakistan from 21 \nOctober to 8 November 2002, to hold discussions with stakeholders and reach agreement with \nthe  Government  on  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The agriculture sector accounted for about 25% of gross domestic product (GDP) in \n2001/02, about 44% of the labor force, and approximately 70% of export earnings. During the \npast decade, the agriculture sector grew at an average annual rate of about 3.5% compared \nwith 4\u20135% previously, due primarily to low productivity and profitability. Total cropped area is \nabout 22 million hectare (ha) of which about 18 million ha is irrigated. Average farm size is \nabout 4 ha. About 20% of all farmers control almost 40% of the cultivated area. Some 80% of \nthe farms are owner-operated, with the remainder farmed by sharecroppers. A summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 1.  \n \n3.  The traditional crops (cotton, wheat, rice, sugarcane, and maize) account for 40% of \nagricultural GDP. Production and marketing systems for these crops are fairly well developed. \nEach crop, however, has specific quality problems that need to be addressed, ranging from \ncontamination  of  cotton  to  genetic  purity  in  Basmati  rice  to  lack  of  uniformity  in  wheat. \nProduction, processing, and marketing systems for minor and horticultural crops are much less \ndeveloped. The organized food-processing industry faces difficulties in procurement of a reliable \nsupply of appropriate quality raw materials as well as severe price fluctuations. Product losses \nare substantial at all levels. Inadequate enforcement of quality and sanitary standards at the \nproduction and local marketing levels also significantly constrains growth of exports. Lack of \nquality seed is a major constraint on increasing agricultural productivity, although the private \nsector seed breeding industry is beginning to develop.  \n \n4.  The  agribusiness  sector  comprises  production;  supply  enterprises  (seed,  fertilizer, \npesticide,  machinery,  and  equipment);  traders;  processors;  exporters;  and  various  service \nproviders (crop contracting, transportation, storage, shipping, etc.). The various elements of the \nagribusiness system vary considerably in sophistication and organization. The agrochemical \nsubsector is made up of several large firms engaged in fertilizer, pesticide, and seed production \nand distribution. The agroprocessing industry is dominated by large cotton-based spinning, \nweaving, textile, and garment manufacturing enterprises, followed by sugar, wheat, and rice \nmilling as well as beverages and processed foods. The food-processing segment of the industry \nis characterized by a few large operations, primarily indigenous, and a host of small and cottage \nenterprises that are largely free from government intervention. \n \n5.  Agribusiness has the potential to become a substantially greater source of economic \ngrowth  and  income  generation,  with  small-scale  farmers  as  major  beneficiaries.  Although \nPakistan has a comparative advantage in the production and export of high-value and other \n                                                 \n1\n  The TA was first listed in the Asian Development Bank Business Opportunity on 22 July 2002.  \n ", "2      \nnontraditional crops, this potential is not generally being translated into significant competitive \nadvantage at the firm and farm level, primarily because of inadequate postharvest facilities and \ngenerally poor infrastructure. Other constraints include adverse policies, ineffective institutions, \nand  varying  approaches  to  regulation  of  product  quality  by  the  federal  and  provincial \ngovernments. Some of the policy issues such as restrictions in trade of agricultural commodities \nand commodity support prices and subsidies are being addressed under Loan 1877\u20131879-\nPAK(SF): Agriculture Sector Program Loan II.2 Issues of governance and access to credit will be \naddressed in the financial sector and small- and medium-sized enterprises in projects under \npreparation. The proposed Agribusiness Development Project will complement these projects in \nenhancing the business environment through capacity building and institutional reforms. \n \n6.  The recent move to form commodity boards, and the increasing number and strength of \nproducer organizations are encouraging signs for agribusiness development. The boards (with \nrepresentation from the Government and various private sector segments of the concerned \nindustries) primarily aim to provide a unified voice and support mechanisms for the various \ncommodity subsectors. Commodity boards have been established for horticulture and dairy. \nAlthough not specifically for agriculture, the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) and the Small and \nMedium Enterprise Development Authority were established to promote business development \nand exports. Several strong industry associations are also active in providing support and \nadvocacy for their commodity subsectors. The Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan is an \nexample of a private sector organization assuming the responsibility of ensuring uniformity in \nquality and standards. \n \n7.  In preparing the TA, extensive consultation was carried out with federal and provincial \ngovernment  agencies,  all  segments  of  private  sector  stakeholders,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and funding agencies. The Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock \n(MINFAL) prefers a project focused on a specific subsector, while other subsectors that warrant \nsupport could be taken up as separate projects. The provincial governments prefer separate \nprojects, coordinated with the federal Government as poor performance may harm overall \nproject implementation. The separation of federal and provincial responsibilities should be \nconsidered  in  recommending  project  implementation  arrangements.  Lessons  were  also \nconsidered from past projects, which have generally suffered delays and cost underruns and \noverruns for various reasons, including deficiencies in project design due to inadequate time \nand  resources  for  project  preparation.3  To  ensure  against  repeating  these  deficiencies, \nemphasis on institutional strengthening and more effective use of consultants and counterpart \nstaff have been recommended. Experience with the implementation of the Agriculture Program \nLoan suggests that policy and other reforms that have political and social implications need to \nbe carefully assessed to determine government commitment and implementation capacity.4 \nSuch reforms should be carried out on a gradual, phased basis. \n \n8.  Given the complexity of agribusiness and the large number of actors, from farm input \nsuppliers to exporters, the Project will be small and focused primarily on the agribusiness \nsystem of one or two commodity subsectors while addressing a few selected problem areas in \nother commodities. The general  consensus is that horticulture (fruits, vegetables, and cut \nflowers and/or foliage) should be accorded first priority. Even within the horticulture sector, \nhowever, the Project should focus initially on a limited number of commodities that exhibit the \n                                                 \n2\n ADB. 2001.

Horticulture products warrant \nsupport as they represent the most immediate prospect for enhancing value addition, increasing \nexports, and raising farm family incomes. Fruit exports between 1990 and 2000, for example, \ngrew by 114% in volume and 342% in value, although total production of the major fruits \nincreased by only 22%. Export of vegetables and floriculture products has good potential. \nExport  expansion,  however,  is  constrained  by  the  lack  of  functional  cold-chain  systems; \ninadequate supply of the proper quality and varieties of seed and planting materials, particularly \nfor vegetables; lack of proper packing materials; poor transport conditions; and generally low \nand variable productivity of horticultural crops. Although a fairly rigorous system of inspection \nand certification is used at export points, product sanitary and quality measures vary greatly at \nprovincial  levels.  The  growth  of  the  horticulture  export  sector  will  require,  and  facilitate \ndevelopment of, the domestic marketing system for horticulture products. The Government of \nSwitzerland is supporting a project to promote horticulture, and the project can build upon the \nexperience gained and lessons learned. \n \n9.  Pakistan is the world's sixth-largest producer of milk, and the dairy industry has potential \nfor growth. A large number of small-scale farmers participate in the industry, which is primarily \nbased on smallholders. Constraints include low levels of productivity due primarily to inferior \nbreeding stock combined with lack of adequate feeding materials, and the deterioration in \nquality  that  occurs  during  handling  and  transport  from  producer  to  consumers.  The  dairy \nsubsector will not receive the same emphasis as horticulture, and proposed interventions will be \nfocused on handling, processing, and value addition, where maximum benefits can be realized.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  help  the  Government  design  a  private  sector-led \nagribusiness development project. The TA output is a feasibility study that includes (i) a detailed \nevaluation of the agribusiness sector; (ii) proposed strategies to develop different subsectors; \n(iii) recommended areas, subsectors, and crops for future development; and (iv) formulation of a \nproject to develop agribusiness.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will be undertaken in two phases. The first will involve a detailed assessment of \nagribusiness sector potential and constraints. The assessment will include (i) a review of \nexisting studies and the traditional farming systems, with particular emphasis on those that \ninclude nontraditional crops such as fruits and vegetables, and processing of dairy produce, and \ntheir role in agribusiness development; (ii) a review of efficiency of water utilization by the \ndifferent cropping systems and its impact on the environment, taking into consideration the \nfindings of TA 3130-PAK: Water Resources Strategy; (iii) a comparative advantage analysis of \ndifferent  crops;  (iv)  the  distribution  system  for  inputs;  and  (v)  processing,  handling,  and \nmarketing of outputs. The assessment should include a systematic analysis of the relevant \ninstitutions  for  input  supply,  production,  and  marketing  (including  research,  development, \nextension,  marketing,  and  commodity  boards)  to  determine  their  effectiveness  and \nresponsiveness to industry needs. The analysis will also include the policy, legal, and regulatory \nframeworks affecting the agribusiness environment as well as the appropriate roles of the \nfederal and provincial governments and the private sector. The analysis will lead to identification \nof (i) different strategies to develop agribusiness in mature and emerging subsectors; (ii) the ", "4      \nsubsectors and commodities demonstrating rapid growth potential for agribusiness development \nin the short and medium term; (iii) the subsectors that warrant further study; (iv) the potential for \nseparate projects or project components at the provincial level; and (v) necessary policy, legal, \nand institutional reforms.  \n \n12.  Based on the findings of the first phase, the second phase will involve formulation of a \nproject for agribusiness development with emphasis on value addition. The proposed project \nshould be broad based to provide maximum benefit to small-scale farmers and enterprises. \nBenefiting small-scale farmers will, however, also require active participation by the entire \nagribusiness system. The proposed Project should act as a catalyst and introduce facilitating \nmechanisms to enable establishment of effective agribusiness systems by the various private \nsector stakeholders and define the areas where the Government can play a supporting role. The \nproposed  Project  should  promote  increased  private  sector  participation  and  facilitate  the \nestablishment  of  linkages  among  all  of  the  agribusiness  stakeholders  to  improve \nresponsiveness to the changing domestic and international markets. Strengthening and capacity \nbuilding will be carried out for selected public and private institutions and organizations to \nensure that they play an effective role in agribusiness sector development. The project design \nwill also include policy, legal, and institutional reforms to enhance productivity and efficiency, \nand create an enabling environment to improve the competitiveness of agriculture. The outline \nterms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 2. \n \n 13.  The  first  and  second  phases  are  envisaged  to  take  3.5  months  and  2.5  months, \nrespectively, during which close consultation with federal, provincial, and district governments \nas well as private sector stakeholders, including farmers, traders, processors, middlemen, \nmarketers, and exporters will be carried out at all stages. Farmer organizations and NGOs will \nbe consulted to explore means of involving them in the Project. Private stakeholders will also be \ninvolved in the initial assessment and project formulation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total TA cost is estimated at $876,000 equivalent, comprising $452,000 in foreign \nexchange costs and $424,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) will finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $248,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency costs for a total of $700,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from \nADB's TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining local cost of $176,000 \nequivalent. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government \nhas been informed that TA approval does not commit ADB to finance an ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MINFAL is the Executing Agency for the TA and responsible for coordinating with the \nrelevant federal and provincial departments and agencies as well as providing logistical support \nto the TA consultants. MINFAL has appointed a full-time counterpart to assist the Mission in \noverall coordination and support. The Mission requested that the counterpart staff continue in \nthis capacity throughout the TA and project implementation. The Government assured ADB that \n(i) requisite support staff in addition to the counterpart will be provided to support the TA \nconsultants; (ii) appropriate transportation will be provided for counterpart staff and consultants; \n(iii) office space, utilities, furnishings, and local communication facilities will be provided for the \nconsultants and counterparts; and (iv) assistance will be provided for surveys, stakeholder \nworkshops,  and  participatory  workshops.  A  steering  committee  will  be  established  with ", "    5 \nrepresentatives  from  the  federal  and  provincial  agencies  to  provide  guidance  to  the  TA \nconsultants and will meet as required. \n \n16.   A total of 44.5 person-months of consulting services, comprising 17.5 person-months of \ninternational and 27 person-months of domestic inputs, are required. International consultant \nexpertise will be required in institutional, agribusiness, financial market, horticulture, and dairy \nindustry aspects. Domestic consulting expertise will be required in institutional, agriculture \nmarketing,  economics  and  financial,  horticulture  industry,  dairy  industry,  social,  and \nenvironmental aspects. Provision is also made for an additional 3 person-months of short-term \nassignments for experts drawn from local industry. A consulting firm or consortium of firms will \nbe selected in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method and other arrangements satisfactory to the ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. The simplified technical proposal procedure will be used to select the \nconsulting firm.  \n \n17.  The  TA  will  commence  in  May  2003  and  be  completed  in  November  2003.  The \nconsultants will be based in Islamabad and travel extensively nationwide for consultation. They \nwill conduct workshops at inception and at the end of the first and second phases at the \nprovincial  and  federal  levels  to  obtain  feedback  from  the  Government  and  private  sector \nrepresentatives  and  other  stakeholders.  The  consultants  will  also  conduct  participatory \nworkshops for farmers and entrepreneurs, local community groups, farmers' organizations, and \nNGOs to solicit their views. The consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 4 weeks of \ncommencement, outlining the work program, methodology, and relevant preliminary findings; (ii) \nan interim report at the end of the first phase setting out the detailed sector assessment, \nproposed strategies, and proposed subsectors; (iii) a draft final report setting out the feasibility \nstudy for a proposed project within 5.5 months of commencement; and (iv) a final report within \n0.5 month after submission of the draft final report. Tripartite meetings among the Government, \nADB, and TA consultants will be held after submission of the inception, interim, and draft final \nreports. There will be a month's break between the first and second phase for ADB and the \nGovernment to further study and reach agreement on the consultants' recommendations. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to the Government \nof Pakistan for preparing the Agribusiness Development Project, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. The technical assistance, initially financed as a grant, will be subject to the \nreimbursement arrangements set forth in Technical Assistance Operations5 and Streamlining of \nTechnical Assistance Operations.6 If the technical assistance results in an ADB loan, ADB may \ncharge against the loan, and recover from it, the portion of the initial grant that exceeds \n$250,000 equivalent.  \n                                                 \n5\n  ADB. 1977.

Linkage to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in Country Poverty  Sector identified as a national priority in Country Poverty \nAnalysis? Yes. To reduce absolute poverty from 30% in  Partnership Agreement? Yes. One of ADB\u2019s medium-term \n2001 to 15% in 2011, the Government has a strategy to  development goals is to promote economic growth and \naccelerate  the  economic  growth  rate  of  four  critical  stability of income and employment in rural Pakistan. \nsectors  (agriculture,  SMEs,  IT,  and  energy).  The \nGovernment plan is to develop agribusiness in Pakistan \nand promote economic growth. \nContribution of the sector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \nAbout 75% of the poor in Pakistan live in rural areas, a proportion of whom are pushed into poverty because of income \nvolatility. The agricultural sector accounted for about 25% of GDP in 2001/02, employs about 44% of the labor force, \nand accounts for approximately 70% of export earnings. Over 95% of the employed rural population depend on \nagriculture  for  their  livelihood  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Comprising  production  input  enterprises,  farmers  and \nproducers, traders, processors, exporters, and various service providers, agribusiness has the potential to become a \nmuch more important source of economic growth and income generation, with small farmers as major beneficiaries. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis            Economic Growth \nRural Poverty. Poverty is widespread but has historically been higher in rural than urban areas. Pakistan has no official \npoverty lines and, as a result, several poverty studies have all used different figures. The Federal Bureau of Statistics \n(using the expenditures necessary for intake of 2,550 calories as the poverty line) reported incidence of poverty in 1998-\n1999 at 32% overall and at 36% in the rural areas. Poverty incidence has probably risen since then, due to the decline \nin growth of nonfarm activities and in public sector development spending. Inequality also increased during the 1990s. \nAlthough growth in agriculture averaged 3.5% per  year during the past 10 years, the incidence of rural poverty is \nestimated to have increased by over 7% in the same period. Pakistan does not have gender-disaggregated poverty-\nrelated data. However, various studies show that women bear a disproportionately high share of the burden of poverty \nwithin the family and society. Women\u2019s access and control over productive resources is extremely limited. Women\u2019s \nmobility is restricted and gender segregation and female seclusion are common. Poverty is characterized by economic \nvulnerability (households do not have diversified sources of income to smooth out consumption expenditure in response \nto exogenous shocks) and social vulnerability (denial of basic rights, social exclusion, corruption, manipulation of \nregulatory controls, and insecurity). The poor also have low education, large households, and few physical assets, and \nrely disproportionately on informal sector jobs.  \n \nRural Poverty and the Agriculture Sector. One of the root causes of rural poverty is heavy dependence on \nagriculture, which has been marred by low growth in the last decade. Over the last 3 years the agricultural sector has \ngrown at an annual rate of about 1.8%, significantly lower than the average growth rate of over 4% observed in the \n1980s and most of the 1990s. Due to a dearth of other opportunities in the agricultural sector, the impact of low \nagricultural growth on the rural economy was severe and incomes declined and unemployment and underemployment \nincreased. The reasons for low agricultural growth are multidimensional and include low productivity and profitability, \ndistorted commodity markets, weak research and extension services, and lack of an agribusiness system. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis: The TA will involve participation of stakeholders at different levels and from different sectors, \nincluding government, production input enterprises, farmers and producers, traders, processors, exporters, and various \nservice providers. Farmers, women, and the rural poor will be active participants. The Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and \nLivestock; Ministry of Commerce; provincial governments; and various research institutions and extensions will be \nactively involved.  \nParticipation strategy required. Yes. \nThe TA implementation will follow an integrated participatory approach. Involvement of stakeholders from various levels \nand sectors will ensure that the approach is adhered to. An important aspect will be the participation of the target \npopulation in project formulation, planning, implementation, and monitoring.  \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nD.

The consultants will carry out a feasibility study for a private sector-led agribusiness \ndevelopment project. The first phase of the study will entail a detailed assessment of the \nagriculture and agribusiness sector, efficiency of water resources utilization under the land \ntenure and farming systems, impact of such utilization on socioeconomic conditions and the \nenvironment, and agribusiness development opportunities and constraints. The assessment will \ninclude the roles and performance of public and private sector institutions and organizations and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), with the objective of building on successful agribusiness \ndevelopment initiatives by already-existing institutions. The assessment will also examine the \nlegal, regulatory, and policy framework affecting agribusiness and horticulture. Based on this \nevaluation,  the  consultants  will  recommend  (i)  strategies  for  development  of  different \nsubsectors, with emphasis on value addition; (ii) subsectors and/or commodities in which \nPakistan has a comparative advantage and which should thus be the focus of the project; (iii) \nsubsectors/commodities  with  potential  for  future  development,  which  warrant  further  study \nleading to possible future projects; (iv) roles and responsibilities for the public and private \nsectors, including the delineation of roles and responsibilities of federal, provincial, and district \ngovernments;  (v)  potential  to  develop  separate  projects  at  the  provincial  level;  and  (vi) \nnecessary changes in the policy, legal, and institutional framework. \n \n2.  The second phase will entail formulation of a project to act as a catalyst and introduce \nfacilitating  mechanisms  to  enable  establishment  of  effective  agribusiness  systems  by  the \nvarious private sector stakeholders. The second phase will focus on (i) the rationale and \nobjectives of the proposed project, (ii) the scope and project components as well as the \nstakeholders and project beneficiaries, (iii) estimated project cost, (iv) benefits accruing to the \nstakeholders and beneficiaries, (v) project viability and the associated risks, and (vi) social and \nenvironmental  impact  of  the  project.  The  project  design  should  incorporate  the  necessary \nchanges in policy, legal, and institutional framework, and the assistance and capacity building \nrequired  for  these  changes.  The  report  should  include  a  logical  project  framework  and \narrangements for procurement and monitoring and evaluation. \n \n3.
