Consistent with the Bank's medium-term strategic objectives and policies,\nBank-funded projects aim to improve the economic well-being for beneficiaries while\nprotecting the natural environment. In recent years, the Bank has recently allocated\nsignificant amounts of resources for the enhancement of environmental quality and\nimproved environmental management in developing member countries (DMCs).\n2. As a broad-based development institution, the Bank should ensure that its\nlending support projects and programs that promote economic growth together with the\nbest possible improvement in environmental quality. It is also important that the Bank\npursue a better environmental investment portfolio across different countries. Such efforts\nwill require an objective assessment of Bank-funded environmental projects and\nprograms.1 Development projects should mitigate adverse environmental impacts, and\nenvironmental projects should enhance environmental quality.\n3. The Bank's Regional Technical Assistance (TA) Screening Committee\nendorsed the approach and management approved the concept on 2 March 1998 for a TA\non Environmental Performance in Selected DMCs. 2 A May 1998 Fact-finding Mission\nreached an understanding with the participating DMCs on the objectives, scope, terms of\nreference, cost estimates and implementation arrangements of the TA.3\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n4. The Bank took several steps in 1997 toward improving performance\nevaluation and the quality of Bank assistance to DMCs. A Project Performance\nManagement System (PPMS) was formulated by the Bank to serve as a management tool\nfor planning, managing, monitoring, and evaluating progress and impacts during the entire\nproject cycle. The report on overall impact assessment methodology and the indicators to\nbe used are being formulated at present. Within the framework of this new system, the\nconcept of project performance report was introduced and is currently under trial\nimplementation in selected projects. The new type of report is intended not only to gauge\nphysical and financial progress, but also to highlight progress toward achieving\ndevelopment objectives. Environmental performance has been identified as a main focus\nfor this work, and the TA will provide inputs to performance indicators on environmental\naspects for inclusion in these new performance measuring mechanisms.\n5. An earlier TA4 developed and tested environmental indicators for\nmonitoring and assessment of environmental performance of DMCs. It involved an\nextensive review of literature on environmental quality indicators and their use, which\n1\t\nThe Banks environmental Iendng amounted to $523 million n 1997 or 11 percent of total Bank lending.\n2\t\nAs endorsed by the committee the concept and the approach for the TA is regional, although pilot testing will\nonly be conducted in one country (reference: 02 March 1998 memo of VPs (West and East) regarding the TA).\nThe TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition ) in February 1998.\nTA No. 5542-REG: Environmental Indicators and Indices, for $818000, approved on 16 August 1993.\n_\t -\t -- - -\n-. -\t -\nT_._\t -\t\n::I-!-': \t\nK\t U\n-\t -\t -\t -\t -\t - -\n-\t -\t -\t -\t -\t _I-\n-\t -\t -\t -\t - - -\t --\n-\t -\t -\t -\t -", "\t\t\t\n\t\n2\nresulted in the selection of three indicators  for testing in 20 countries in the Asian region.\n1\nThe results were published in 1997 in a report entitled  Measuring Environmental Qualify in\nAsia and as an environmental paper entitled Measuring Environmental Performance in\nAsia.  Appendix 1 summarizes the important findings of the TA. Its focus was primarily on\n2\nmethodological development and undertaking country-level case studies; hence, results\nwere merely indicative of the overall environmental quality of the countries studied.\n6. Results of TA No. 5542-REG were disseminated through a limited number\nof seminars conducted in and outside the Bank, including the World Bank's conference on\nenvironmental indicators in October 1997 in New York. Seminar participants and\nprominent authorities in the field have commended the Bank's effort. However, the\nlimitations of the study were well recognized; they include issues related to methodology,\ndata availability, and the scale of assessment. The data used were highly aggregated to\nnational scales. Any country-level performance indicator faces problems of data\naggregation omissions and sampling errors similar to widely accepted shortcomings of\neconomic indicators such as gross national product or national income. These limitations\nhighlight the need to (i) refine methodologies developed in TA No. 5542-REG to assess\nenvironmental quality, (ii) test the indicators in different scales of Bank operations (country,\nsector, or project), and (iii) develop or improve environmental databases for performance\nmeasurements in the DMCs. The TA will address these ssues as a follow-up to TA No.\n5542-REG.\nIll.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n7. The TA will review, modify, and test environmental quality indicators\nincluding those used in TA No. 5542-REG in selected sector and project-level investments\nto improve the measurement of environmental quality with respect to development impacts\nB.\t Scope\n\t8.\t The TA will consist of two phases:\nIn Phase I, the TA will involve a national workshop in the Philippines to\ndisseminate and validate the findings of TA No. 5542-REG and to identify\npertinent new issues. At least one national workshop will be held then (in\neither Bangladesh or the People's Republic of China [PRC]) to review\nproposals to alter the methodologies and to identify required adjustments\nfor replicability in other DMCs.\nThe three indicators are (i) cost of remediatiori, defined as the estimate of resources required to restore\nenvironmental quality to a desired level as measured by a predefined standard; (ii) environmental elasticity,\nwhich measures the percentage change in environmental quality with respect to the percentage change in\neconomic development, and shows the trend in the changes to the economy and the environment in a country;\nand (iii) environmental diamond\" which is a physical measure of four key environmental variables expressed\nas a diagram designed to compare actual conditions with a predetermined ideal.\n2\t\nJalal, K.

Then, based\non the modified methodologies, a few sector-specific examples that can be\nused for demonstration purposes will be developed.\n9. The TA will be implemented at first in only one DMC. The Philippines has\nbeen chosen as the pilot case, because time series environmental data can be obtained\nfrom its environmental management system, and localized environmental data is available\ndue to the country's decentralization of environmental management. Also, Bank-funded\nprojects in the Philippines cover a wide range of sectors. Ideally, this pilot case will be\nreplicated in other DMCs through a future TA. The concept of having a pilot case is further\njustified by the uncertainty in results obtained, and setbacks in data availability. The\ncoverage of the TA requires an innovative approach, which has a degree of high risk, and\nthe achievement of the TA's objective will be a difficult task.\n10. The TA will cover sectors such as urban environment and natural\nresources (including forests and coastal resources), as well as issues like energy-\nenvironment relationships. The first phase of the TA (dissemination activities) will set the\nstage for the second phase of work on refining the indicators. After Phase I, there will be a\nmeeting to review the methods, devise strategies to overcome any data problems, and\ndecide on directions for proceeding with remaining TA activities.\n11. The second phase of the TA will consist of six components: (i) a review of\nthe Bank's project and sector investments in the Philippines to assess the environmental\nand economic impacts as well as the degree of success; (ii) data collection on these\ninvestments and their environmental impacts; (iii) consultation with other development\nassistance organizations on selection and application of environmental quality indexes; (iv)\nevaluation of project effects and sector performance, including the refinement of the\nmethodologies for deriving indicators used in TA No. 5542-REG; and (v)\nrecommendations to the Bank for future investment priorities in terms of projects and\nsectors, institutional mechanisms for monitoring environmental changes, and suggestions\nfor integrating environmental indicators with measures of overall development impacts.\nThe work will also utilize databases developed under a recently concluded TA.  Through\n1\nTA No. 5555-REG, a Philippine Framework for the Development of Environmental\nStatistics was developed, including a compendium of time series environmental statistics.\nBuilding on a Philippine Government executive order to institutionalize environment and\nnatural resource accounting,  the TA will further streamline data requirements for\n2\nenvironmental performance measurement, and develop a framework for more efficient\ndata collection.\nTA No. 5555-REG: Institutional Strengthening and Collection of Environmental Statistics in Selected DMCs, for\n$900,000, approved on 18 November 1993. The findings and results were finalized in a closing workshop in\nMay 1998.\nExecutwe Order 406 (21 March 1997), Institutionalization of Philippine Economy-Environment and Natural\nResource Accounting.\n- :'.: :::::\nLJL LIJ\t c14UV\t tIIlLiUfLII 1ITL LII\t tiir.\n.\t .\t ..\t .\t -\t \u2022l\t J\nI LI I\t tnriirin\t I irIr'IrIrr r,rrmIr'T\t rI1, rrrI1 Ir1m\t CTrIIT.flI  rSr\t rmI \"rIT %\t.#LJr4'rIl,ar,\trryI iI.,f'l .4r1, r4rI ,I, lA.a nLIr I CTILr\trTr,CrI IS, ICAILIICT CrIIi SYCrI\t ul,alI.,.a '..lI CIVV LI I L\u00bcd's4'LI CII YVILI\nI\nS l..1InIF eP-irSI lItl nnel Ira tI.s-,t ,tel\t -,\t L1C\t flrf%alrs',Cafl rlflslaltsnnnant Inetitl ttlflfl tIflt\n.................. ..\nIII\t -\t\n+ :: ':\nI-Ll- v-\t --1-lC--I1-CI\u2022C\t.I\t \t .\t I\t YrI\t ri iri\t rtI,I,\trrr\t ir\"5\"\t II\t I\t I\t .-\t LJCII II'.

The TA will help develop performance measures that consider\nenvironmental quality for use in the assessment of Bank investments. The TA results will\ncomplement the framework and assessment procedures proposed by various Bank\ndepartments for assessing the development impacts of Bank investments. Follow-up\nactivities may be undertaken under a future TA if results of the TA are of merit. The TA\nframework is presented in Appendix 2.\nC.\t Cost Estimate and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $541 000 equivalent, comprising\n$375,000 in foreign exchange cost and $166,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The TA\nwill be financed by the Bank on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the\nGovernment of Japan. The Bank will finance $441,000, which will be the entire foreign\nexchange cost and $66,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The contribution of the\nGovernment is valued at $100,000. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are\ngiven in Appendix 3.\n0.\t Implementation Arrangements\n14. An interdepartmental steering committee of Bank staff has been formed to\nreview the results of TA No. 5542-REG and to guide preparation of the TA. The steering\ncommittee will also provide guidance in TA implementation, while the Bank's Office of the\nChief, Office of Environment and Social Development (OEOC), will execute the TA. The\nPhilippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) will function as the\nImplementing Agency. DENR will nominate a suitably qualified focal person to oversee\nlocal activities and to liaise with officials in relevant agencies such as the Finance\nDepartment, National Economic and Development Authority, National Statistics Office, and\nnongovernment organizations. The focal person in coordination with the Philippine Council\nfor Sustainable Development will establish a multisector working committee. Its members\nwill be senior-level officials with qualifications acceptable to the Bank.\n15. The TA will be carried out over a period of eight months. A consulting firm\nwith a multidisciplinary team of international and domestic consultants (6 person-months of\ninternational consultants and 8 person-months of domestic consultants), along with an\nindividual consultant to serve as environmental quality index specialist (2 person-months\nof international consultant), will work closely with DENR. The consultants will be selected\nin accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other\narrangements satisfactory to the Bank on engagement of local consultants. The\nconsultants will have expertise in environmental index development, statistics, economics,\nengineering, life sciences, impact assessment, and other relevant fields.\n16. The consultants will prepare four reports: an inception report (which\nincludes an evaluation of the findings of TA No. 5542-REG and new procedures to be\ndeveloped), an interim report, a draft final report, and a final report to be prepared as\nspecified in the terms of reference (Appendix 4). The terms of reference will be further\nrefined prior to and during the inception workshop.\n17. OEOC will monitor and periodically report on the progress of TA\nimplementation. The procurement of equipment and materials needed for the TA will be\ni s, is.\t s_is., till, C\u2022A\t l\t 1_iCil Lit..,IIJCZI l.a ai RI\t ,Iu,rLiriril,-rlI-Ii\t lr1r1I1:-Iirirs\t ir\t I Inrr1rlAr\t I 545,11\t \u2022fl\t MlAI\t Y rrw\t 'S'-\"5Sa\"Sm'\t Irrp\t _#'_ Tlf'ls'fl?i\n)l 9I'\t nrr1TCirnrCi rin\nVJIt\t lIflhi1Ll.J (Ill IHI(1111 IliIilllqI Ill\n:_:\t C I.

This appendix summarizes the results of the Bank's technical assistance\n(TA) on environmental indicators and indexes that developed three methodologies for\ncross-country comparison of environmental performance. 2 The first, cost of remediation\n(COR), is defined as the total investment required to move from the existing state of the\nenvironment to a desired one as measured by predetermined standards. The second,\nenvironmental elasticity, measures the percentage change in environmental quality with\nrespect to the percentage change in economic development and shows the trend in\neconomic and environmental changes in a country. Third, the 'environmental diamond\" is\na physical measure of four key environmental variables expressed as a diagram and used\nto compare actual conditions with a predetermined ideal.\n2. While many factors contribute to quality of life (including socioeconomic\ndevelopment and environmental quality), relatively few environmental indexes have been\nconceived that are widely accepted. By contrast, many socioeconomic indicators have\nbeen developed and are generally used: gross domestic product, consumer price index,\nhuman development index, etc. The three new measures of environmental performance,\nalong with existing socioeconomic indicators, are intended to aid development planners in\nformulating better strategies for environmental and socioeconomic development of\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) of the Bank.\n3. Data gathered by the TA from 20 DMCs covering a ten-year period show\nthat the total COR (or cost of \"cleaning up\" the environment) in the developing countries of\nAsia and the Pacific amounts to about $35 billion per year. Of this, more than 85 percent\n(or $30 billion per year) is required by five countries (in descending order): People's\nRepublic of China (PRO), India, Mongolia, Indonesia and Pakistan. Except for Mongolia,\nthese countries also happen to be the Bank's major borrowers. The results of this TA\nindicate that these five countries are likely to continue to dominate the Bank's lending\nprofile for years to come.\n4. In the Asian and Pacific region, the annualized COR as a percentage of\nGDP varies between 0.24 percent (Singapore) and 7.43 percent (Lao People's\nDemocratic Republic). Mongolia has an especially high figure, since its COR for\necosystems is affected by extreme weather conditions.

However, the demand\nfor external financing of environmental projects in these countries should be dependent\nupon their ability to mobilize domestic resources as well as their technological\ncapabilities. Data from selected Organization and Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment countries reveal that these countries allocate 1.5-2 percent of their GDP\nfor environmental protection expenditures among other DMCs vary but should approach\na target of 1 percent. Despite the uncertainties regarding how much a country can\nafford and is willing to pay for its environmental cleanup, it is reasonable to conclude\nthat countries with higher COR/GDP ratios are more likely to require external financial\nassistance.\n5. In terms of the environmental impact of economic development, the\nenvironmental elasticity values computed for 16 Asian countries indicate that, from 1980 to\nthe early 1990s, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka have had the best performance. The\nincrease of GDP growth rates has been accompanied by positive environmental changes,\ni.e., improvement in environmental quality or reduction of environmental pressure, a\nseemingly sustainable scenario. The other countries have all experienced negative\nenvironmental changes as their economy grew. However, with the exception of Viet Nam,\ntheir rates of environmental deterioration have been generally lower that their rates of\neconomic growth, which we characterize as \"weakly sustainable.\" In particular, the two\nlargest countries, PRC and India, are ranked favorably. This suggests that, although the\ntwo countries may face enormous environmental challenges, their rates of environmental\ndeterioration may have either slowed or remained relatively low. In contrast, for Viet Nam,\nevery 1 percent increase of GDP has been achieved at the expense of more than 1\npercent decrease in the environmental aggregate, i.e.. decrease in environmental quality\nor increase of environmental pressure.\n6. Looking at the overall state of the environment using the \"environmental\ndiamond\" constructed for the 16 countries, the Philippines plus several South Asian\ncountries including Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka have performed better than the\naverage. At the other end of the spectrum, PRC and Mongolia seem to have a much\nworse-than-average state of the environment.\n7. Future methodological refinements should focus on sector-specific and\nproject-level indexes to help the Bank to assess the impacts of past investments. Such\nindexes measuring environmental impact of projects would require economic and\nenvironmental information covering periods both before and after the project.\n-\" -\t\nItI\t 1I_l\t r\t IV\t Itf% I ritz\t IL1rTII I\t .\nt-)\t c\t 1rIr;ir\t I\u2022\t -\t - -\n.11 IIQI\t LQ ?Ql I \u00e72I\t VV I IVI I VI LJL.J'I I.JI\t I I I\t I\t I rtu\t ?pIII?I\t (\t ' i4,'i\nff1I I '\t X' TfII?I\t I I \u2022\t I\t .II I\t ucl%.III\t rrrmt,Ir\t rmi i rr1iu,r1\t .\u2022\u2022..'\u2022- \u2022 ..\u2022\n(,rurrirylIJhT\n-\t .. - - - -\t .\u2022\t \u2022. \u2022.\t \u2022 \u2022\u2022 \u2022\t -U\t \u2014\u2022\t \u2022 - \u2022\u2022,',\n\u2022./", "\t\n8\nAppendix 2, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nProject Component\t Targets\t Monitoring\t Risks!\nAssumptions\nI.

Consistent with the Bank's medium-term strategic objectives and policies,\nBank-funded projects aim to improve the economic well-being for beneficiaries while\nprotecting the natural environment. In recent years, the Bank has recently allocated\nsignificant amounts of resources for the enhancement of environmental quality and\nimproved environmental management in developing member countries (DMCs).\n2. As a broad-based development institution, the Bank should ensure that its\nlending support projects and programs that promote economic growth together with the\nbest possible improvement in environmental quality. It is also important that the Bank\npursue a better environmental investment portfolio across different countries. Such efforts\nwill require an objective assessment of Bank-funded environmental projects and\nprograms.1 Development projects should mitigate adverse environmental impacts, and\nenvironmental projects should enhance environmental quality.\n3. The Bank's Regional Technical Assistance (TA) Screening Committee\nendorsed the approach and management approved the concept on 2 March 1998 for a TA\non Environmental Performance in Selected DMCs. 2 A May 1998 Fact-finding Mission\nreached an understanding with the participating DMCs on the objectives, scope, terms of\nreference, cost estimates and implementation arrangements of the TA.3\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n4. The Bank took several steps in 1997 toward improving performance\nevaluation and the quality of Bank assistance to DMCs. A Project Performance\nManagement System (PPMS) was formulated by the Bank to serve as a management tool\nfor planning, managing, monitoring, and evaluating progress and impacts during the entire\nproject cycle. The report on overall impact assessment methodology and the indicators to\nbe used are being formulated at present. Within the framework of this new system, the\nconcept of project performance report was introduced and is currently under trial\nimplementation in selected projects. The new type of report is intended not only to gauge\nphysical and financial progress, but also to highlight progress toward achieving\ndevelopment objectives. Environmental performance has been identified as a main focus\nfor this work, and the TA will provide inputs to performance indicators on environmental\naspects for inclusion in these new performance measuring mechanisms.\n5. An earlier TA4 developed and tested environmental indicators for\nmonitoring and assessment of environmental performance of DMCs. It involved an\nextensive review of literature on environmental quality indicators and their use, which\n1\t\nThe Banks environmental Iendng amounted to $523 million n 1997 or 11 percent of total Bank lending.\n2\t\nAs endorsed by the committee the concept and the approach for the TA is regional, although pilot testing will\nonly be conducted in one country (reference: 02 March 1998 memo of VPs (West and East) regarding the TA).\nThe TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition ) in February 1998.\nTA No. 5542-REG: Environmental Indicators and Indices, for $818000, approved on 16 August 1993.\n_\t -\t -- - -\n-. -\t -\nT_._\t -\t\n::I-!-': \t\nK\t U\n-\t -\t -\t -\t -\t - -\n-\t -\t -\t -\t -\t _I-\n-\t -\t -\t -\t - - -\t --\n-\t -\t -\t -\t -", "\t\t\t\n\t\n2\nresulted in the selection of three indicators  for testing in 20 countries in the Asian region.\n1\nThe results were published in 1997 in a report entitled  Measuring Environmental Qualify in\nAsia and as an environmental paper entitled Measuring Environmental Performance in\nAsia.  Appendix 1 summarizes the important findings of the TA. Its focus was primarily on\n2\nmethodological development and undertaking country-level case studies; hence, results\nwere merely indicative of the overall environmental quality of the countries studied.\n6. Results of TA No. 5542-REG were disseminated through a limited number\nof seminars conducted in and outside the Bank, including the World Bank's conference on\nenvironmental indicators in October 1997 in New York. Seminar participants and\nprominent authorities in the field have commended the Bank's effort. However, the\nlimitations of the study were well recognized; they include issues related to methodology,\ndata availability, and the scale of assessment. The data used were highly aggregated to\nnational scales. Any country-level performance indicator faces problems of data\naggregation omissions and sampling errors similar to widely accepted shortcomings of\neconomic indicators such as gross national product or national income. These limitations\nhighlight the need to (i) refine methodologies developed in TA No. 5542-REG to assess\nenvironmental quality, (ii) test the indicators in different scales of Bank operations (country,\nsector, or project), and (iii) develop or improve environmental databases for performance\nmeasurements in the DMCs. The TA will address these ssues as a follow-up to TA No.\n5542-REG.\nIll.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n7. The TA will review, modify, and test environmental quality indicators\nincluding those used in TA No. 5542-REG in selected sector and project-level investments\nto improve the measurement of environmental quality with respect to development impacts\nB.\t Scope\n\t8.\t The TA will consist of two phases:\nIn Phase I, the TA will involve a national workshop in the Philippines to\ndisseminate and validate the findings of TA No. 5542-REG and to identify\npertinent new issues. At least one national workshop will be held then (in\neither Bangladesh or the People's Republic of China [PRC]) to review\nproposals to alter the methodologies and to identify required adjustments\nfor replicability in other DMCs.\nThe three indicators are (i) cost of remediatiori, defined as the estimate of resources required to restore\nenvironmental quality to a desired level as measured by a predefined standard; (ii) environmental elasticity,\nwhich measures the percentage change in environmental quality with respect to the percentage change in\neconomic development, and shows the trend in the changes to the economy and the environment in a country;\nand (iii) environmental diamond\" which is a physical measure of four key environmental variables expressed\nas a diagram designed to compare actual conditions with a predetermined ideal.\n2\t\nJalal, K.

Then, based\non the modified methodologies, a few sector-specific examples that can be\nused for demonstration purposes will be developed.\n9. The TA will be implemented at first in only one DMC. The Philippines has\nbeen chosen as the pilot case, because time series environmental data can be obtained\nfrom its environmental management system, and localized environmental data is available\ndue to the country's decentralization of environmental management. Also, Bank-funded\nprojects in the Philippines cover a wide range of sectors. Ideally, this pilot case will be\nreplicated in other DMCs through a future TA. The concept of having a pilot case is further\njustified by the uncertainty in results obtained, and setbacks in data availability. The\ncoverage of the TA requires an innovative approach, which has a degree of high risk, and\nthe achievement of the TA's objective will be a difficult task.\n10. The TA will cover sectors such as urban environment and natural\nresources (including forests and coastal resources), as well as issues like energy-\nenvironment relationships. The first phase of the TA (dissemination activities) will set the\nstage for the second phase of work on refining the indicators. After Phase I, there will be a\nmeeting to review the methods, devise strategies to overcome any data problems, and\ndecide on directions for proceeding with remaining TA activities.\n11. The second phase of the TA will consist of six components: (i) a review of\nthe Bank's project and sector investments in the Philippines to assess the environmental\nand economic impacts as well as the degree of success; (ii) data collection on these\ninvestments and their environmental impacts; (iii) consultation with other development\nassistance organizations on selection and application of environmental quality indexes; (iv)\nevaluation of project effects and sector performance, including the refinement of the\nmethodologies for deriving indicators used in TA No. 5542-REG; and (v)\nrecommendations to the Bank for future investment priorities in terms of projects and\nsectors, institutional mechanisms for monitoring environmental changes, and suggestions\nfor integrating environmental indicators with measures of overall development impacts.\nThe work will also utilize databases developed under a recently concluded TA.  Through\n1\nTA No. 5555-REG, a Philippine Framework for the Development of Environmental\nStatistics was developed, including a compendium of time series environmental statistics.\nBuilding on a Philippine Government executive order to institutionalize environment and\nnatural resource accounting,  the TA will further streamline data requirements for\n2\nenvironmental performance measurement, and develop a framework for more efficient\ndata collection.\nTA No. 5555-REG: Institutional Strengthening and Collection of Environmental Statistics in Selected DMCs, for\n$900,000, approved on 18 November 1993. The findings and results were finalized in a closing workshop in\nMay 1998.\nExecutwe Order 406 (21 March 1997), Institutionalization of Philippine Economy-Environment and Natural\nResource Accounting.\n- :'.: :::::\nLJL LIJ\t c14UV\t tIIlLiUfLII 1ITL LII\t tiir.\n.\t .\t ..\t .\t -\t \u2022l\t J\nI LI I\t tnriirin\t I irIr'IrIrr r,rrmIr'T\t rI1, rrrI1 Ir1m\t CTrIIT.flI  rSr\t rmI \"rIT %\t.#LJr4'rIl,ar,\trryI iI.,f'l .4r1, r4rI ,I, lA.a nLIr I CTILr\trTr,CrI IS, ICAILIICT CrIIi SYCrI\t ul,alI.,.a '..lI CIVV LI I L\u00bcd's4'LI CII YVILI\nI\nS l..1InIF eP-irSI lItl nnel Ira tI.s-,t ,tel\t -,\t L1C\t flrf%alrs',Cafl rlflslaltsnnnant Inetitl ttlflfl tIflt\n.................. ..\nIII\t -\t\n+ :: ':\nI-Ll- v-\t --1-lC--I1-CI\u2022C\t.I\t \t .\t I\t YrI\t ri iri\t rtI,I,\trrr\t ir\"5\"\t II\t I\t I\t .-\t LJCII II'.

The TA will help develop performance measures that consider\nenvironmental quality for use in the assessment of Bank investments. The TA results will\ncomplement the framework and assessment procedures proposed by various Bank\ndepartments for assessing the development impacts of Bank investments. Follow-up\nactivities may be undertaken under a future TA if results of the TA are of merit. The TA\nframework is presented in Appendix 2.\nC.\t Cost Estimate and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $541 000 equivalent, comprising\n$375,000 in foreign exchange cost and $166,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The TA\nwill be financed by the Bank on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the\nGovernment of Japan. The Bank will finance $441,000, which will be the entire foreign\nexchange cost and $66,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The contribution of the\nGovernment is valued at $100,000. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are\ngiven in Appendix 3.\n0.\t Implementation Arrangements\n14. An interdepartmental steering committee of Bank staff has been formed to\nreview the results of TA No. 5542-REG and to guide preparation of the TA. The steering\ncommittee will also provide guidance in TA implementation, while the Bank's Office of the\nChief, Office of Environment and Social Development (OEOC), will execute the TA. The\nPhilippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) will function as the\nImplementing Agency. DENR will nominate a suitably qualified focal person to oversee\nlocal activities and to liaise with officials in relevant agencies such as the Finance\nDepartment, National Economic and Development Authority, National Statistics Office, and\nnongovernment organizations. The focal person in coordination with the Philippine Council\nfor Sustainable Development will establish a multisector working committee. Its members\nwill be senior-level officials with qualifications acceptable to the Bank.\n15. The TA will be carried out over a period of eight months. A consulting firm\nwith a multidisciplinary team of international and domestic consultants (6 person-months of\ninternational consultants and 8 person-months of domestic consultants), along with an\nindividual consultant to serve as environmental quality index specialist (2 person-months\nof international consultant), will work closely with DENR. The consultants will be selected\nin accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other\narrangements satisfactory to the Bank on engagement of local consultants. The\nconsultants will have expertise in environmental index development, statistics, economics,\nengineering, life sciences, impact assessment, and other relevant fields.\n16. The consultants will prepare four reports: an inception report (which\nincludes an evaluation of the findings of TA No. 5542-REG and new procedures to be\ndeveloped), an interim report, a draft final report, and a final report to be prepared as\nspecified in the terms of reference (Appendix 4). The terms of reference will be further\nrefined prior to and during the inception workshop.\n17. OEOC will monitor and periodically report on the progress of TA\nimplementation. The procurement of equipment and materials needed for the TA will be\ni s, is.\t s_is., till, C\u2022A\t l\t 1_iCil Lit..,IIJCZI l.a ai RI\t ,Iu,rLiriril,-rlI-Ii\t lr1r1I1:-Iirirs\t ir\t I Inrr1rlAr\t I 545,11\t \u2022fl\t MlAI\t Y rrw\t 'S'-\"5Sa\"Sm'\t Irrp\t _#'_ Tlf'ls'fl?i\n)l 9I'\t nrr1TCirnrCi rin\nVJIt\t lIflhi1Ll.J (Ill IHI(1111 IliIilllqI Ill\n:_:\t C I.

This appendix summarizes the results of the Bank's technical assistance\n(TA) on environmental indicators and indexes that developed three methodologies for\ncross-country comparison of environmental performance. 2 The first, cost of remediation\n(COR), is defined as the total investment required to move from the existing state of the\nenvironment to a desired one as measured by predetermined standards. The second,\nenvironmental elasticity, measures the percentage change in environmental quality with\nrespect to the percentage change in economic development and shows the trend in\neconomic and environmental changes in a country. Third, the 'environmental diamond\" is\na physical measure of four key environmental variables expressed as a diagram and used\nto compare actual conditions with a predetermined ideal.\n2. While many factors contribute to quality of life (including socioeconomic\ndevelopment and environmental quality), relatively few environmental indexes have been\nconceived that are widely accepted. By contrast, many socioeconomic indicators have\nbeen developed and are generally used: gross domestic product, consumer price index,\nhuman development index, etc. The three new measures of environmental performance,\nalong with existing socioeconomic indicators, are intended to aid development planners in\nformulating better strategies for environmental and socioeconomic development of\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) of the Bank.\n3. Data gathered by the TA from 20 DMCs covering a ten-year period show\nthat the total COR (or cost of \"cleaning up\" the environment) in the developing countries of\nAsia and the Pacific amounts to about $35 billion per year. Of this, more than 85 percent\n(or $30 billion per year) is required by five countries (in descending order): People's\nRepublic of China (PRO), India, Mongolia, Indonesia and Pakistan. Except for Mongolia,\nthese countries also happen to be the Bank's major borrowers. The results of this TA\nindicate that these five countries are likely to continue to dominate the Bank's lending\nprofile for years to come.\n4. In the Asian and Pacific region, the annualized COR as a percentage of\nGDP varies between 0.24 percent (Singapore) and 7.43 percent (Lao People's\nDemocratic Republic). Mongolia has an especially high figure, since its COR for\necosystems is affected by extreme weather conditions. In general, the transitional\neconomies (from planned economy to market economy) including Cambodia, PRC, Lao\nPDR, and Viet Nam demand the highest allocation of GDP (>4.5 percent) for\nenvironmental cleanup in order to achieve environmental goals, followed by India,\nTA No. 5542-REG; Environmental Indicators and Indices, for $818 000, approved on 16 August 1993.\n2 \nJalal, K.

However, the demand\nfor external financing of environmental projects in these countries should be dependent\nupon their ability to mobilize domestic resources as well as their technological\ncapabilities. Data from selected Organization and Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment countries reveal that these countries allocate 1.5-2 percent of their GDP\nfor environmental protection expenditures among other DMCs vary but should approach\na target of 1 percent. Despite the uncertainties regarding how much a country can\nafford and is willing to pay for its environmental cleanup, it is reasonable to conclude\nthat countries with higher COR/GDP ratios are more likely to require external financial\nassistance.\n5. In terms of the environmental impact of economic development, the\nenvironmental elasticity values computed for 16 Asian countries indicate that, from 1980 to\nthe early 1990s, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka have had the best performance. The\nincrease of GDP growth rates has been accompanied by positive environmental changes,\ni.e., improvement in environmental quality or reduction of environmental pressure, a\nseemingly sustainable scenario. The other countries have all experienced negative\nenvironmental changes as their economy grew. However, with the exception of Viet Nam,\ntheir rates of environmental deterioration have been generally lower that their rates of\neconomic growth, which we characterize as \"weakly sustainable.\" In particular, the two\nlargest countries, PRC and India, are ranked favorably. This suggests that, although the\ntwo countries may face enormous environmental challenges, their rates of environmental\ndeterioration may have either slowed or remained relatively low. In contrast, for Viet Nam,\nevery 1 percent increase of GDP has been achieved at the expense of more than 1\npercent decrease in the environmental aggregate, i.e.. decrease in environmental quality\nor increase of environmental pressure.\n6. Looking at the overall state of the environment using the \"environmental\ndiamond\" constructed for the 16 countries, the Philippines plus several South Asian\ncountries including Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka have performed better than the\naverage. At the other end of the spectrum, PRC and Mongolia seem to have a much\nworse-than-average state of the environment.\n7. Future methodological refinements should focus on sector-specific and\nproject-level indexes to help the Bank to assess the impacts of past investments. Such\nindexes measuring environmental impact of projects would require economic and\nenvironmental information covering periods both before and after the project.\n-\" -\t\nItI\t 1I_l\t r\t IV\t Itf% I ritz\t IL1rTII I\t .\nt-)\t c\t 1rIr;ir\t I\u2022\t -\t - -\n.11 IIQI\t LQ ?Ql I \u00e72I\t VV I IVI I VI LJL.J'I I.JI\t I I I\t I\t I rtu\t ?pIII?I\t (\t ' i4,'i\nff1I I '\t X' TfII?I\t I I \u2022\t I\t .II I\t ucl%.III\t rrrmt,Ir\t rmi i rr1iu,r1\t .\u2022\u2022..'\u2022- \u2022 ..\u2022\n(,rurrirylIJhT\n-\t .. - - - -\t .\u2022\t \u2022. \u2022.\t \u2022 \u2022\u2022 \u2022\t -U\t \u2014\u2022\t \u2022 - \u2022\u2022,',\n\u2022./", "\t\n8\nAppendix 2, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nProject Component\t Targets\t Monitoring\t Risks!\nAssumptions\nI.
