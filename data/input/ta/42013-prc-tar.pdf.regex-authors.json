During  the  Country  Programming  Mission  in  December  2007,  the  Government  of  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) for an Urban Wastewater Reuse and Sludge Utilization Policy \nStudy. The TA has been included in the ADB nonlending program for the PRC for 2008.1 The \nFact-Finding Mission visited Beijing from 25 February to 12 March 2008. This report is based on \nthe understanding reached with the Government during the mission regarding the impact and \noutcome,  methodology  and  key  activities,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA, as well as the mission\u2019s observations. The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The continuous economic growth of the PRC since the start of its economic reforms in 1978 \nhas been accompanied by rapid urbanization. The urban population grew from 160.0 million in \n1975 to about 577.1 million in 2006.2The urbanization rate increased from 17.0% to 43.9% in the \n \nsame period and is expected to reach 55.0% (or an urban population of about 700 million) by 2030. \nThis rapid urbanization was fueled largely by the transformation of suburban areas from farming to \nnon-farming activities and by the massive migration of surplus rural labor to urban areas. The \nnumber of cities in the PRC increased from 192 in 1978 to 656 in 2006, and there are now also \n19,522 towns. Sustainable urbanization is a key policy priority in the Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year \nPlan (11FYP) (2006\u20132010). \n \n3.  Water resources vary considerably from north to south across the PRC. In 2005, annual \nwater resources available for the northern region of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner \nMongolia totaled 70.87 billion cubic meters (m3) versus a staggering 693.9 billion m3 for the \nsouthern region of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan.3 Per capita water \nresources were 524 m3 per year in the north and 2,370 m3 in the south, and the water quantities \nsupplied were 329 m3 and 480 m3, respectively. The small surplus of resource over supply in the \nnorthern  provinces  will  soon  vanish.  The  wastewater  from  the  urban  areas  poses  a  major \nenvironmental threat to the country\u2019s rivers, lakes, and aquifers. Of the 36.3 billion m3 of urban \nwastewater produced in the PRC in 2006, only about 55.67% was treated; the rest was discharged \nuntreated into rivers and lakes, causing widespread pollution. Wastewater discharged into key river \nbasins, however, must meet class 1A standards\u2014it can be reused without further treatment. \n \n4.  Until the urban centers mushroomed there was enough water for modest needs and, hence, \npeople saw no need to recycle. Investments went elsewhere and little thought was given to \nwastewater reuse. With tariffs for public water supplies pushed down to a minimum by social \npressures, there was hardly any incentive to treat sewage effluents to a standard acceptable for \nreuse. As it is, many cities have problems collecting even the standard wastewater treatment \ncharge. Possible health risks in the public\u2019s view have also militated against wastewater use. In \n2006, the PRC used 961 million m3 of recycled wastewater. The 11FYP target for northern PRC \nalone by 2010 is 1,825 million m3 (5 million m3 per day). This water will be used in irrigation, public \namenities, street cleaning, toilet flushing, and non-potable domestic and industrial uses. \n \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 May 2008. \n2   The urban population in the PRC is made up of people who are officially registered residents of cities and towns. \n3   PRC National Bureau of Statistics. 2006. China Statistical Yearbook 2006. Available: http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/ \n2006/indexeh.htm ", "2 \n5.  Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the PRC produced about 5.5 million tons of dry \nsludge in 2006.4 A significant proportion was used in agriculture and the rest was dumped in \nlandfills or disposed of by other means.5 In the past, the disposal of wastewater sludge was not \nseen  to  create  unacceptable  environmental  problems,  largely  because  the  quantities  were \nrelatively small and some disposal options were not vigorously regulated. Dumping in sacrificial, \nnon-engineered, landfills was accepted, provided it was monitored to some extent and the results \nwere recorded. Sludge treatment options are now being tested by the Government. Meanwhile, \ndumping continues to be the least-cost option, diminishing attempts to secure the safe, beneficial \nuse of sludge on agricultural land or to recover energy. Recent requirements for environmental \nprotection and advances in landfill technology have, however, hiked dumping cost, prompting a \nmore active search for alternative disposal options.  \n \n6.  To arrest pollution and improve the quality of the environment, the Government has set the \nlong-term goal of building a resource-efficient and environment-friendly society, specifically by \nreducing major pollutants per unit of gross domestic product by 10% during the 11FYP period. \nCities will be required to treat at least 70% of their wastewater by the end of the period. The 508 \nnew  WWTPs  developed  by  the  Government  in  1998\u20132005  have  boosted  capacity  by \n53.44 million m3 per day. But a recent government audit of these WWTPs indicated that they lack \nfunds  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  because  of  the  low  tariffs.  An  additional \nCNY332 billion ($46.76 billion) in government funding has been set aside in the 11FYP for urban \nwastewater management (UWM), including expanded wastewater collection and treatment, sludge \ntreatment,  and  wastewater  reuse.  The  Government  has  shown  strong  commitment  to \nmarket-based  reforms  for  UWM,  aware  of  the  need  for  tariff  reforms  to  raise  funds  for  the \nconstruction and O&M of tertiary treatment plants for the reuse of wastewater. The State Council \ndecision  issued  in  December  2005  adopting  a  scientific  approach  to  development  and \nstrengthening environmental protection requires the implementation of tariffs for UWM based on \nfull cost recovery plus a small margin of profit. It also allows local governments to subsidize O&M \nof waste management facilities when revenues are not enough to cover the full costs. The Ministry \nof  Construction  (MOC)  is  responsible  for  developing  national  policies  and  guidelines  for \nwastewater management, including sewage sludge treatment and disposal. MOC also oversees \ndevelopment  plans  and  investments  in  wastewater  management,  while  city  municipality \ndepartments plan, implement, and operate the wastewater projects and facilities.  \n \n7.  The proposed TA will focus on the development of the following: (i) planning procedures \nand regulations, sustainable pricing structures, technology applications, and institutional capacity \nfor promoting wastewater reuse; and (ii) a national policy for the application of technologies for the \nsafe disposal of sludge, emphasizing the opportunity to reclaim energy in one form or another. \nThese policies will embody the concept of carbon credits in pricing structures and will seek to \nminimize the carbon footprint. The structures, policies, and guidelines thus developed will be \npilot-tested for effectiveness in three selected cities and refinements from the practical experiences \ngained in the cities will be reflected in the concluding report.6 The pilot cities chosen will have \ntreatment facilities with which the TA team can work to reuse wastewater or reclaim energy from \nsludge, or both. International expert opinion will be obtained in the development of national policies, \nand international case studies will be prepared to illustrate the marketing, sale, and reuse of \nwastewater,  and  the  treatment  and  use  of  organic  carbon  compounds  in  sewage  sludge  to \ngenerate energy, and of nutrient components to improve soil conditions. \n \n                                                 \n4   Equivalent to about 27.6 million tons of wet sludge at 80% moisture content. \n5   Co-disposal with municipal solid waste, incineration, spreading for municipal greening. \n6  The case study cities will be selected by MOC before the TA is implemented. In the selection of the cities, areas where \nfuture ADB projects will be implemented will be considered. The choices will be discussed and the final selection will \nbe made during the TA contract negotiations. ", "3 \n8.  The urban sector is an ADB investment priority in the PRC. ADB has built a strategic \npartnership with MOC over the last 10 years. The partnership is built on a series of highly relevant \nand successful TA projects, which yielded national policy frameworks and guidelines for the key \nurban issues facing large and medium cities in the PRC. Among these were two TA projects that \nsupported water tariff reforms, TA aimed at strengthening urban solid waste management, and TA \nfor the development of urban wastewater tariffs. 7 The recommendations from these TA projects \nhave been applied in later ADB-financed loan projects in the urban sector. Two TA projects\u2014\nUrban Wastewater and Solid Waste Management for Small Cities and Towns, and Policy Study on \nMarket-Based  Instruments  for  Water  Pollution  Control\u2014are  providing  ongoing  support  to  the \nGovernment.8 \n \n9.  The proposed TA is consistent with the 11FYP and is aimed at assisting the Government in \ndeveloping  policies,  strategies,  and  action  plans  to  promote  and  effectively  implement  urban \nwastewater reuse and sludge management. It is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor the PRC, which is concerned with managing the environment, catalyzing investment, and \nimproving governance, among others.9 It conforms to ADB\u2019s Water Policy and the recently adopted \nWater  Financing  Program,  both  of  which  seek  to  improve  urban  water  investments  through \ntechnical assistance and investments in water supply, sanitation and wastewater management, \nand environmental improvement. The TA will have a positive impact on the living environment of \nurban residents, including the poor, through water and resource conservation and waste and \nenergy  recycling.  It  also  supports  ADB\u2019s  clean  energy  policy,  its  Renewable  Energy,  Energy \nEfficiency, and Climate Change (REACH) Program and the Carbon Market Initiative.10 Introducing \ntertiary  wastewater  treatment,  especially  when  based  on  engineered  wetland  principles,  and \nreclaiming the energy potential in sewage sludge are positive steps toward clean energy and \nclimate change mitigation. Moreover, the TA will support implementation of the law recently passed \nby  the  Government  to  increase  the  production  of  energy  from  sustainable  sources,  and  its \nrecommendations could also lead to the preparation of investment projects where ADB could \nprovide further financing assistance. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA will strengthen the wastewater reuse and sewage sludge utilization management \nsystem in the PRC and make it more effective and efficient. Its outcome will be the adoption of a \nset  of  policies  and  tariff  guidelines  to  promote  the  reuse  of  wastewater,  and  technical  and \nmarket-based approaches to encourage sustainable sludge disposal, including energy recovery, by \nmunicipalities in the PRC.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will be implemented in three phases. Phase 1 (3 months), will involve (i) reviewing \nplanning  strategies  and  procedures,  pricing  policies,  quality  standards,  and  monitoring  and \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1997.

In phase 2 (5 months), the TA team will concern itself with (i) formulating a structure for \ndefining  urban  planning  policies  and  implementation  guidelines  relating  to  wastewater  reuse; \n(ii) formulating a policy framework for a tariff structure covering the range of options for urban \nwastewater  reuse  including  the  potential  to  promote  investments  through  public-private \npartnerships; (iii) formulating a regulatory framework for monitoring the reuse of wastewater and \nimplementing  the  tariff  guidelines;  (iv)  identifying  capacity-building  needs  and  preparing  an \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  training  program;  (v)  developing  a  policy,  guidelines,  and \nrecommended courses of action for applying appropriate technologies to deal with the treatment \nand  disposal  of  sewage  sludge,  including  energy  recovery  (biogas,  co-incineration)  and  soil \nimprovement options (fertilizer); (vi) developing application modality and associated legal changes \nnecessary to facilitate the use of energy from sludge treatment and end uses; (vii) organizing and \nmanaging an international study tour of best practice in the foregoing topics; (viii) designing three \npilot applications to test the recommended guidelines for appropriate wastewater reuse and sludge \ntreatment,  including  energy  recovery  (where  applicable),  and  preparing  cost  estimates  and  a \ndetailed  implementation  plan;  (ix) developing  technical,  thematic,  and  safeguard  assessment \nguidelines for evaluating pilot trials during implementation; (x) preparing an interim report; and (xi) \norganizing a workshop in each pilot city. \n \n13.  In  phase  3  (10  months),  MOC  will  be  assisted  in  (i)  implementing  the  pilot  projects, \nincluding awareness campaigns, and revising the guidelines on the basis of the results of the pilot \ntrials; (ii) preparing a comprehensive best-practices policy note on planning, tariff strategies, and \nregulations for wastewater reuse and guidelines for sludge disposal, emphasizing energy recovery \nand land improvement options; (iii) recommending appropriate measures to strengthen operational \nmanagement; (iv) drafting and finalizing the final report; (v) disseminating the findings of the report \nto all levels of government and stakeholders; and (vi) organizing an international symposium to \nshare findings and experiences. \n \n14.  Major risks to the successful implementation of the TA are (i) inadequate counterpart \nsupport and performance, (ii) inadequate or ill-timed provision of necessary data, (iii) delayed \nsubmission of required studies, (iv) delayed appointment and mobilization of consultants, and \n(v) inadequate  performance  by  the  consultants.  To  mitigate  the  risks,  the  recruitment  and \nperformance of the consultants will be monitored closely. The Government has agreed to provide \nadequate counterpart support and all necessary data according to an agreed-upon timetable. \nClose coordination among the consultants, the executing and implementing agencies, and ADB will \nfurther moderate the risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000 equivalent. The proposal is for ADB to finance \n$1,000,000 with grants from its TA funding program ($700,000) and from the Multi-Donor Trust \nFund for the Water Financing Partnership Facility to be administered by ADB ($300,000).11 MOC \nwill provide the remaining $200,000 in local costs covering part of the technical staff costs and also \nin-kind  counterpart  costs  and  services  including  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  furniture, \n                                                 \n11  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, and Norway.

MOC will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will coordinate for the purpose with the \nrelevant  central,  provincial,  and  municipal  government  authorities.  It  will  assign  appropriate \ncounterpart staff to assist the consultants,12and form a project steering committee to guide and \n \nsupport the proposed TA. The committee will be chaired by the MOC vice minister concerned and \nwill  include  the  directors  general  of  the  Departments  of  Urban  Development,  Science  and \nTechnology,  and  International  Relations  of  MOC  and  relevant  officers  of  the  ministries  and \nagencies concerned. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over an 18-month period, from November 2008 to April 2010. \nConsulting services totaling 73.5 person-months (13.5 international and 60.0 national) will be \nrequired. The international consultants will provide expertise in urban planning and management, \nwater governance and pricing policy, sludge treatment and energy recovery options, environmental \nmanagement, and soil science. The national consultants will have expertise in urban planning, \npolicy  and  regulatory  frameworks,  water  pricing  and  tariff  structuring,  wastewater  and  sludge \ntreatment  processes,  environmental  management,  financial  and  economic  analyses,  and \ninstitutional capacity development. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The consultants will be hired through a firm according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) on the basis of the quality of the proposal (90%) \nand the cost (10%) of the services to be provided (quality- and cost-based selection method) using \nthe full technical proposal procedures. The 90:10 weighting is considered appropriate because the \nTA is a complex multidisciplinary assignment that requires innovation and creativity, and the quality \nof the consulting services will have a high impact on the ensuing policies and guidelines. All reports \nby the consultants will be prepared in English and translated into Chinese. The consultants will \nmaintain close working relations with ADB and with MOC and will regularly discuss progress and \nfindings. Tripartite meetings involving ADB staff, the consultants, and MOC will be held to provide \nguidance to the consultants and to review their reports.  \n \n19.  The MOC will provide a suitably furnished office with utilities and telecommunication access; \nintercity transport for the consultants; materials, maps, data, and documents required for the TA; \nand the cost of utilities for the use of the consultants, counterpart professional staff, and support \nstaff. The TA equipment will be procured by the consultants according to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and transferred to MOC after the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant \nbasis to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Urban Wastewater Reuse and \nSludge Utilization Policy Study, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n12 MOC\u2019s excellent track record in implementing the earlier TA projects has strengthened its capacity to implement the \nproposed TA.
