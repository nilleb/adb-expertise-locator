With the endorsement of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness,1 developed and \ndeveloping countries, and multilateral and bilateral development institutions have committed to \nmanaging for development results (MfDR). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) sponsored \nhigh-level forums organized by the Working Party on Aid Effectiveness, comprising members of \nthe Development Assistance Committee, which spearheaded MfDR. ADB is applying MfDR in \nits own operations and is actively promoting MfDR within its developing member countries \n(DMCs). This regional technical assistance (TA) is in line with the commitments contained in the \nParis Declaration (para. 46), which commits ADB together with other multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment  institutions  to  jointly  work  with  DMCs  \u201cto  strengthen  country  capacities  and \ndemand for MfDR at the local level.\u201d Thus, the TA is directly responsive to the Paris Declaration \non Aid Effectiveness.   \n \n2.    The ADB Institute is facilitating this effort and organized a workshop on development \nmanagement for senior executives in Tokyo on 4\u20138 April 2005. An ADB mission2 participated in \nand contributed to the workshop as resource persons. The workshop focused on the concept of \nresult-based management (RBM)3 at the national, sectoral, agency, program, and project levels. \nThirty-one senior executives from 10 DMCs\u2014Bangladesh, Cambodia, Fiji Islands, Indonesia, \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Philippines, Samoa, and Viet Nam\u2014took \npart and prepared country and organization-specific action plans. The participants elaborated on \nhow ADB could support MfDR at the executing agency (EA) and project level. Their requests \nand recommendations form the basis of this TA.4 The TA design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  During the 1990s, many DMCs undertook extensive public sector reforms in response to \neconomic,  social,  and  political  pressures.  While  the  reform  packages  varied,  they  shared \ncommon aspects: a focus on performance issues and on achieving results, an orientation to \ncustomer needs and preferences, an emphasis on participation, reform of budget processes \nand financial management systems, and application of modern management practices. The \ncentral feature of these reforms is the prominence of improving performance, in other words that \ngovernment activities achieve desired results. Subsequently, a range of aid-funded activities \nfocused on various aspects of RBM. The Development Assistance Committee5 summarized \nsome preliminary lessons about establishing RBM systems in DMCs: (i) strong leadership for \nRBM is essential, (ii) building RBM systems requires sufficient time (5\u201310 years) and resources, \n(iii) begin with pilot activities to demonstrate effective RBM practices, (iv) provide a range of \ndifferent support mechanisms to establish RBM systems, and (v) build ownership by using \nparticipatory processes.  \n \n                                                 \n1  High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness. 2005. Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Paris. \n2  The mission comprised R. K. Leonard, principal evaluation specialist; P. Bastoe, principal results and management \nspecialist; and A. Iffland, principal project performance management specialist.  \n3  RBM involves several phases: (i) agreeing on objectives, (ii) selecting indicators and targets, (iii) monitoring \nperformance (collecting data on results), and (iv) analyzing and reporting those results against the performance \ntargets. MfDR, in its original context of RBM, refers to the use of performance information generated as part of the \nRBM approach by internal management. This is commonly referred to as \u201cmanaging-for-results.\u201d The international \naid community has adopted this term and expanded it in the context of development effectiveness. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 2 June 2005. \n5  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 2004. Result-Based Management in the Development \nCo-operation Agencies: A Review of Experiences (Executive Summary). Paris, pp. 22\u201324.  \n ", "2   \n4.  These lessons underlie ADB\u2019s commitment and approach to RBM and MfDR. This is \nalso evidenced by ADB applying MfDR principles of to its own operations: (i) at the project \ndesign stage by strengthening the design and monitoring frameworks of projects, ensuring \nresults-based  sector  road  maps,  and  adopting  results-focused  project  quality-at-entry \nprocedures;  (ii)  at  the  implementation  stage  by  developing  country-specific  monitoring \nmechanisms that enable reporting on results; and (iii) after project completion by making ADB \nevaluation  and  reporting  more  results-focused.  At  the  country  level,  RBM  is  being \noperationalized  through  the  introduction  of  results-based  country  strategies  and  programs. \nThese, combined with the national development plans and poverty reduction strategies, form \nthe basis of a national results framework. This approach enhances the planning capacity of \nDMCs\u2019 lead government planning agencies and strengthens the demand and leadership for \nRBM. However, the responsibility to deliver development outcomes is subsequently delegated \nto  sector  agencies,  local  governments,  or  subordinated  divisions.  Their  capacity  to  plan, \nmanage, implement, and account for results of policies, programs, and projects is critical for \nachieving development outcomes\u2014from problem analysis and stakeholder dialogue through to \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. ADB has gained some experience in introducing \nRBM on a pilot basis in sector agencies.6  \n \n5.  Postevaluation reports of ADB projects often point to overambitious project designs, ill-\ndefined results, performance targets and indicators that cannot be measured or monitored, and \nlack of ownership by and weak capacities of EAs for less than successful delivery of project \noutputs and outcomes. These findings highlight some of the flaws and shortcomings in the \nproject cycle. They also suggest that a large number of projects are designed with limited \nstakeholder  involvement,  and  are  overly  dependent  on  consultant  inputs.  While  this  is \ndebatable, evidence suggests that there is certainly room for improvement. The appreciation of \nlocal knowledge of issues and experiences of what can realistically be implemented is limited, at \nbest. EAs and other key stakeholders need to understand the project design process, master \nthe design tools, and fully participate in all stages of the design. This would bring greater focus \nto the project design, build ownership, and improve project implementation.  \n \n6.  The challenges during the project implementation phase are plentiful, and to a large \nextent,  the  consequence  of  the  shortcomings  of  the  design  process  and  the  subsequent \nproduct. EAs, faced with implementing complex designs, are managerially ill-equipped and \nunderresourced. The solution often adopted to address the EAs\u2019 weak project management \ncapacity is to set up standalone project implementation units,7 which are substantially staffed \nwith  domestic  and  expatriate  consultants.  This  strategy,  however,  does  not  address  the \nfundamental issue of EAs\u2019 weak capacity to implement projects efficiently and effectively, and to \nmanage project assets and operations after project completion. The availability and qualification \nof staff are predominantly cited as the root causes of EAs\u2019 weak capacity. While the availability \nof staff is outside the control and influence of ADB and this TA, the knowledge and skills base of \nstaff to develop and manage projects efficiently and effectively can be addressed.    \n \n7.  Furthering the effectiveness of development programs and projects requires reaching \nout to agencies responsible for producing project and program results. These are typically \nsector agencies or local governments that have a key role in delivering priority outcomes and \noutputs through projects and programs important to poverty reduction, achievement of the \nMillennium  Development  Goals,  and  other  national  medium-term  goals.  ADB  has  the \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Results-Based Management for Sector Agencies. Manila. The \nregional TA focused on sector agencies in education and health in Cambodia and Mongolia.  \n7  The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness contains explicit commitments to avoid the use of parallel project \nimplementation units. The aim is to help build sustainable local capacity instead.  \n ", "  3\nresponsibility to work on a continuous basis with these agencies and to strengthen their results \nfocus,  enhance  their  management  systems,  and  develop  their  staff  competencies,  so  that \nprojects  achieve  their  intended  outcomes,  and  postproject  completion  benefits  continue  to \naccrue to the economy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will enable selected EAs in all DMCs to apply results-focused approaches and \ntools in participatory program/project design and management (outcome). The TA aims to \ncontribute to more effective and efficient delivery of development programs and services by \nDMC government agencies.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA incorporates four strategic approaches: (i) introduces up to 80% of EAs in all \nDMCs to RBM approaches and systems, (ii) builds the capacity of local facilitators to sustain \nsupport  for  the  application  of  results-based  approaches,  (iii)  pilot  tests  results-focused \norganizational development approaches to organizational capacity building of EAs, and (iv) \ndevelops innovative learning tools and disseminates documentation on experiences with RBM \napproaches.  \n \n10.  Output 1. Familiarize EAs with RBM approaches and systems, and their application in \nproject design and management. A series of 3 regional and up to 22 country workshops will \nprovide  the  necessary  learning  opportunities  for  EA  senior  staff  and  project  managers \nresponsible for ADB-funded projects.8 These workshops will (i) introduce analytical tools for \nsituation analysis and project design, (ii) address stakeholder participation in the project cycle, \n(iii) explain how to define and measure results, (iv) deal with project risks, (v) practice critical \npath  analysis  for  project  implementation,  (vi)  elaborate  on  the  preparation  of  annual \nimplementation plans, (vii) cover project monitoring and reporting practices, and (viii) provide an \noverview of project evaluation techniques.  \n \n11.  Output 2. Create a pool of local facilitators9 in selected DMCs knowledgeable about \nresults-focused project design and management. Train-the-trainer workshops will be conducted \nin at least 10 countries. These workshops will train potential facilitators in the application of \nparticipatory techniques for (i) the design and monitoring framework approach, and (ii) project \nmonitoring and evaluation. This will provide EAs and ADB with an in-country pool of resource \npersons able to facilitate, i.e., problem tree analysis, participatory project planning workshops, \nand stakeholder reviews. Selected facilitators will undergo on-the-job training by cofacilitating \nworkshops in other DMCs. The TA will develop a facilitator\u2019s code of conduct, an accreditation \nsystem, and standard terms of reference for a selection of events; and set up a roster of \nfacilitators.  \n \n12.  Output 3. Pilot test results-focused and client-led organizational capacity development \napproaches with 1\u20132 EAs in up to five DMCs, preferably one DMC from each of the subregions \n                                                 \n8  The TA will train 1\u20132 senior staff of up to 250 executing agencies (EAs), which represent about 80% of all EAs \nADB is currently working with.  \n9  Individuals and staff of national institutions with a background in facilitation, project management, or related \nbackground will be considered for the train-the-trainer workshops. Approximately 15 facilitators will be trained in up \nto 10 DMCs. The selection will be carried out by ADB in close coordination with resident missions.  \n ", "4   \nin which ADB operates (East and Central Asia, the Mekong, the Pacific, South Asia, and \nSoutheast Asia). As organizational capacity development is a long-term process, this regional \nTA supports this first phase of this process. A range of additional measures tailored to the \nspecific circumstances of each DMC will need to be followed for an extended time to sustain the \norganizational changes. The selection of the DMCs and EAs will be finalized at the start of TA \nimplementation. The main selection criterion is the demonstrated commitment of the EA to \nparticipate.  The  TA  aims  to  include  a  variety  of  EAs  representing  different  levels  of \nadvancement  on  RBM  and  sectoral  focus,  and  will  build  on  synergies  with  other  ongoing \ninitiatives. TA services are contingent on the expressed interest of the EA and a no-objection \nletter from the DMC. Once confirmed, the following steps will be performed sequentially: (i) \nconduct  a  diagnostic  analysis  of  capacity  constraints  for  results-focused  management,  (ii) \ndevelop a capacity-building plan and a corporate performance monitoring system, (iii) support \nand backstop the implementation of (ii), and (iv) monitor and evaluate performance changes of \nEAs. Based on the interest generated by the RBM training conducted by the ADB Institute, and \nfeedback and requests received from the participating DMCs, the TA assumes that the pilot EAs \nwill  demonstrate  their  commitment  to  RBM  by  designating  staff  and  resources  for  the \nimplementation of the four output 3 activities. The induction training provided under output 1 will \nprecede activities carried out under output 3.  \n \n13.  Output 4. Share innovative training tools and experiences of the pilot-tested results-\nbased organizational development approaches. E-learning tools will be adapted/developed for \npreparing  the  design  and  monitoring  frameworks  and  project  management.  The  process, \ngenerated  results,  and  experiences  gained  from  the  pilot  tests  will  be  documented  and \ndisseminated  together  with  a  step-by-step  do-it-yourself  guide  (part  of  output  4).  A \ndissemination strategy will be prepared that incorporates a wide range of means, i.e., media, \npresentations at conferences, articles, the internet. The e-learning tools and documentation of \nexperiences will also be disseminated through the MfDR Community of Practice, organized by \nthe ADB Results Management Unit.  \n \n14.  The  TA  design  is  based  on  several  assumptions  essential  for  successful  TA \nimplementation and achievement of results. The assumptions include that (i) the EAs will retain \nworkshop participants (output 1) for at least 1 year, and the brain drain will be limited at least \nduring this period; (ii) the facilitators will be available to perform the tasks for which they are \nqualified  (output  2),  and  (iii)  the  pilot  EAs  will  designate  adequate  staff  and  recourses  to \nimplement the organizational capacity development approaches (output 3). Further, the TA \noutcome will only be achieved if (i) aid agencies agree on a joint results-focused agenda and \npursue a harmonized approach in its operationalization, and (ii) DMCs have created incentives \nfor their agencies to adopt MfDR. The latter assumption is supported by the DMCs\u2019 commitment \nto  MfDR  (para.  1)  and  the  associated  performance  target,  ratified  as  part  of  the  Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $950,000 equivalent, of which $721,850 will be in foreign \nexchange and $228,150 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  for  $850,000.  The  DMC  governments  will  provide  office \naccommodation, counterpart staff, and miscellaneous expenses equivalent to $100,000. The TA \nwill  finance  3  regional  and  up  to  22  country  workshops,  international  consulting  services, \ntraining equipment and materials, and the development of e-learning programs. Detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA. The Central Operations Services Office \n(COSO) will implement the TA in close cooperation with the regional departments and resident \nmissions, the latter acting as in-country focal points for the TA. COSO staff will be resource \npersons. Letters of no objection from each of the DMCs will be obtained prior to initiation of the \nTA in the DMC. \n \n17.  International  individual  consultants  with  expertise  in  (i)  participatory  planning  and \nmanagement training (10 person-months), and (ii) organization development (8 person-months) \nwill be recruited on an intermittent basis during TA implementation. Each consultancy may be \ncarried out by more than one consultant to generate time efficiencies and build on country \nexperiences.  The  national  and  regional  training  programs  under  outputs  1  and  2  will  be \nconducted by COSO staff with support from the participatory planning specialist. Specifically, \nthe participatory planning and management specialist will (i) develop training materials; and (ii) \ndeliver (a) 20\u201325 induction workshops on project design and management, and (b) 10 train-the-\ntrainer programs in cooperation with COSO staff. The consultant will submit postconduct reports \n2 weeks after completion of each workshop. The organizational development specialist will (i) \ncarry out results-focused, client-led organizational analysis of selected EAs; (ii) assist the EAs in \ndeveloping their respective capacity-building plans; and (iii) support implementation through \ntargeted guidance on technical and management issues. In preparation for the assignment, the \nspecialist  will  consult  with  ADB\u2019s  working  group  on  capacity  building  and  the  Results \nManagement Unit. The consultant will only be engaged when an understanding is reached with \nat  least  two  DMCs  to  participate  in  the  activities  under  output  3.  The  assignment  of  the \norganizational development specialist will be based on a performance contract, details of which \nwill be determined with the EAs, subject to ADB agreement. The consultant will submit (i) an \ninception report for each pilot country, (ii) a progress report after each field visit, and (iii) a draft \nfinal report suitable for subsequent publication. The experiences gained from the pilot-tested \ncapacity-building  approaches  will  be  disseminated  through  an  ADB  publication:  Results-\nFocused Organizational Development: Case Studies from Asia and the Pacific Region. The \nconsultants' terms of reference are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months (October 2005\u2013September 2008). The \ninternational individual consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Procurement under the TA will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. COSO will procure and retain the training equipment.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 on a grant basis for \nResults-Focused Project Design and Management, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nGovernment agencies  The DMCs meet the  Annual reports on the  \u2022  DMCs institutionalize \nof developing member  performance targets  status of Millennium  results-based \ncountries (DMCs)  determined under  Development Goals  management (RBM) \ndeliver programs and  Asian Development  published by DMC  through performance-\nservices more  Fund/International  planning  based contract and \neffectively.
