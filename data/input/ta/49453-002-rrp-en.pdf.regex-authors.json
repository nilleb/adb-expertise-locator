THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Kiribati for the South Tarawa Water Supply Project. The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for the \nSouth Tarawa Water Supply Project, and if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The project will combat factors that result in the high incidence of waterborne disease in \nSouth Tarawa, the capital of Kiribati, through the delivery and effective management of new and \nrehabilitated climate-resilient water supply assets and of improved hygiene practices. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Public health. South Tarawa is highly urbanized with a population of about 62,000 and \nan average population density of around 4,000 persons per square kilometer.1 Natural resources \n(particularly land and potable water) are highly stressed. Overcrowding as well as inadequate \nwater, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) coverage are closely linked to waterborne diseases such \nas  diarrhea  and  dysentery.  A  consistent  increase  in  the  incidence  of  diarrhea  averaged \napproximately 860 new cases per year  between 2002 and 2016.2  \n \n4.  Limited freshwater resources. The Bonriki and Buota groundwater lenses are the only \nfreshwater sources in South Tarawa that are suitable for  producing drinking water, with a \ncombined sustainable yield of about 2,000 cubic meters per day.3 Since leakages from the water \nsupply network are estimated at 67%, only about 700 cubic meters per day, or 11 liters per person \nper day are available to the population through the public water supply network\u2014far below the 50 \nliters per person per day recommended to meet minimum health requirements.4 The projected \npopulation growth means that, without intervention, the gap between supply and demand will \ncontinue to widen. Alternative sources such as household wells are deemed unsafe because of \ngroundwater contamination from human and animal waste, while rainwater supplies cannot be \nrelied upon during droughts. \n \n5.  Climate  change  and  disaster  risk  reduction.  Kiribati  faces  significant  challenges \nbecause of its vulnerability to climate change and disasters triggered by natural hazards. Rising \nsea levels are of particular concern, since most land lies less than 3 meters above sea level. The \nquality and quantity of freshwater provided by the Bonriki and Buota lenses is seriously threatened \nby climate-change-induced inundation and extreme weather events, including prolonged droughts. \nThe simultaneous or successive occurrence of inundation and drought could be catastrophic for \nwater supplies in South Tarawa, effectively reducing the lenses\u2019 yield to zero for periods of up to \n5 years. Taking a precautionary approach, the lenses cannot be relied upon as the main source \nof water in a future with climate change. In addition to drought, natural climate phenomena may \nalso affect demand for clean water on South Tarawa; heatwaves, for instance, will increase per \ncapita demand.\n                                                \n1  Projected from the 2015 Population and Housing Census. Land area of South Tarawa is 16 square kilometers. \n2  Ministry of Health and Medical Services. Data on Betio Town Council and Teinainano Urban Council hospitals in \nSouth Tarawa. Unpublished. \n3 Current water demand is around 4,500m3/d and is projected to increase to more than 6,000m3/day by 2040. \n4  G. Howard and J. Bartram. 2003. Domestic Water Quantity, Service, Level and Health. Geneva: World Health \nOrganization. http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/WSH0302.pdf. \n \n ", "2 \n \n6.  Water supply service levels. Water supplies in South Tarawa are rationed to 2 hours in \nevery 48 hours, and some areas receive no water at all. Nonrevenue water, which includes \nphysical losses from the network, unbilled authorized consumption, and commercial losses such \nas  theft  through  illegal  connections,  has  been  estimated  at  89%.5 While  South  Tarawa\u2019s \ntransmission main was recently rehabilitated, the distribution network is dilapidated and accounts \nfor the vast majority of physical losses. Domestic customers have not paid for water since 2013, \nand customers\u2019 willingness to pay has been eroded by poor service levels; it will take significant \ncommunity engagement and advocacy, in addition to better service levels, to restore it. \n \n7.  Hygiene. Appreciation of the importance of good hygiene is low in South Tarawa, and \nsignificantly improved hygiene practices are needed to head off the surge in waterborne diseases \nas a result of overcrowding and inadequate provision of basic infrastructure. Behavioral change \ninterventions which promote hand washing with soap, household water treatment and safe \nstorage and menstrual hygiene management will continue to play a role in reinforcing key \nmessages and helping to ensure the long-term impacts of WASH interventions are realized.  \n \n8.  Options for increasing water supplies. The Tarawa Water Master Plan 2010\u201320306 \nand the Tarawa Water and Sanitation Roadmap 2011\u201320307 both concluded that seawater \nreverse  osmosis  desalination  represents  a  practical  and  affordable  longer-term  option  for \nsupplementing the water supplies. A comprehensive desalination feasibility study8 was conducted \nin 2012 and endorsed through peer review.9 Desalination is also considered a climate-adaptive \ntechnology, given its ability to improve resilience to water quality degradation and diversify \nexisting water supplies independent of rainfall.10 The government recently reasserted its interest \nin solar photovoltaic desalination to augment water supplies.11 Reducing water losses from the \nnetwork and improving nonrevenue water management are also key to ensuring the efficiency of \nwater supplies.  \n \n9.  Capacity of key institutions. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable Energy \n(MISE) leads national infrastructure development and the provision of public utility services. At \nthe operational level, the main actor is the Public Utilities Board (PUB), a state-owned enterprise \nwhich manages power generation, water supply, and sewage disposal in urban South Tarawa. \nCapacity gaps in key institutions could potentially be accentuated by the implementation of the \ncomplex technology (relative to the existing water supply system) that desalination represents \nand  which  will  require  long-term  skilled  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  overall \nmanagement.  The  project  will  formalize  the  outcomes  of  sector  assessments,  which \nrecommended long-term O&M contracts for critical infrastructure. Parallel capacity development \nactivities are included in the project through specialist support to PUB in key result areas and to \nvocational education and training. The project will also provide project management support to \nthe government. \n                                                \n5  The International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities. https://www.ib-net.org/ (accessed 12 \nMarch 2019). \n6  I.

The project will continue on from the ongoing Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-supported South Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector Project in \ncontributing to  better  health  and fewer  chronic  waterborne  illnesses  among  South Tarawa \ncommunities.12 It is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for 11 Pacific \nsmall island countries, and is aligned with ADB\u2019s (i) Strategy 2030,13 (ii) Pacific Approach (2016\u2013\n2020),14 and (iii) Water Operational Plan 2011\u20132020.15 The project is consistent with the Kiribati \n20-Year Vision 2016\u20132036 (KV20).16 It is also aligned with the Kiribati Joint Implementation Plan \nfor Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management 2014\u20132023 and the Kiribati Integrated Energy \nRoadmap 2016\u20132025.17 \n \n11.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB has strong experience with Kiribati\u2019s development \nof water and other urban infrastructure through its South Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector \nProject, which is on track. As an accredited entity of the GCF, ADB mobilized GCF grant financing \nfor the proposed project. It led the project\u2019s preparation, having funded the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance and the ongoing project design advance (PDA).19ADB\u2019s experience in \nimplementing the Ebeye Water Supply and Sanitation Project,20 which involves desalination \ntechnology in another densely populated Pacific island atoll, was applied in the development of \nthe project.21 ADB is well placed to help capture and disseminate lessons through its investment \nprogram and network of partners across the Pacific. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: health and climate change resilience of \nSouth Tarawa\u2019s population improved.22 The project will have the following outcome: access of \nSouth Tarawa\u2019s population to safe, climate-resilient water supplies increased.22 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Climate resilient and low carbon water supply infrastructure. This will be \nachieved  by  building  a  desalination  plant  of  4,000  cubic  meters  per  day,  whose  energy \nconsumption is offset by a 2,500-kilowatt solar photovoltaic system, and by rehabilitating the water \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2011.

Piped water supply connections will \ninclude all households headed by women in the project area. The desalination plant will be brought online only after \nleakages from the water supply network are reduced through rehabilitation.  \n24 New technical recruitments to MISE and PUB will target at least 20% women. \n25 The program will include gender-sensitive communication and outreach to improve customers\u2019 use and maintenance \nof the new water supply infrastructure, target problematic behaviors linked to hygiene, and strengthen the institutional \nenabling environment for WASH. \n26 An evaluation of positive impacts on women\u2019s daily lives from reliable access to water will also be undertaken. \n27 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $13.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project.  \n \n20.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance a proportion of expenditures \nin relation to the DBO contract, turnkey contract, and consulting services. GCF will provide grant \ncofinancing on a cost-sharing basis equivalent to $28.63 million in relation to the DBO contract, \nturnkey contract, and consulting services, to be administered by ADB. The World Bank will provide \ngrant cofinancing equivalent to $12.96 million in relation to the DBO contract, to be administered \nby the World Bank.

As the project includes financing from the World Bank and GCF, universal procurement \nwill apply.29 Under a project implementation agreement between ADB and World Bank, ADB has \nbeen designated as the lead cofinancier and, consequently, all works, goods, and services \n(including those jointly financed by the World Bank) under the project will be procured by the \nrecipient in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) \nand ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). However, \nsince both ADB and the World Bank will also be jointly financing selected procurement contracts \nunder this project, the respective debarment lists of both ADB and the World Bank will need to be \nmade applicable to such jointly financed contracts under the project. The Agreement for Mutual \nEnforcement of Debarment Decisions dated 9 April 2010 entered into between ADB and other \nmultilateral development banks (including the World Bank), which enables ADB to cross-debar \nentities  debarred  by  other  multilateral  development  banks  (including  the  World  Bank),  is \ninsufficient because only debarments that meet certain conditions\u2014e.g., when the period of \ndebarment is more than 1 year\u2014are eligible for cross-debarment. As such, there are entities \ndebarred by the World Bank that are not cross-debarred by ADB. Accordingly, approval by the \n                                                \n28 Details are in Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 ADB. 2013.

The Tarawa Water Master Plan (footnote 6) considered a range of potential sources of \nwater and assessed their capacity to meet present and future demand.31 Seawater reverse \nosmosis desalination was the most attractive, provided its economic operating lifetime is at least \n10 years.32 Several subsequent studies similarly recommended that seawater desalination be \nused to augment potable water supply in South Tarawa.33 The case for desalination is further \n                                                \n30 The PMU will include a project director, water supply manager (part-time from PUB), and electricity supply manager \n(part-time from PUB). The project will fund consultants in the PMU, including project manager, deputy project \nmanager, project accountant, safeguards manager, and social development and gender specialist. \n31 Rainwater harvesting, household water wells, groundwater from groundwater reserves in South Tarawa, potential \nnew groundwater sources in North Tarawa, and nonconventional sources of water were considered. \n32 For the proposed project, an economic operating lifetime of 20 years is expected. \n33 These include (i) Fraser Thomas Partners. 2012.

Water use efficiency is a further adaptation strategy and will be achieved through more \neffective nonrevenue water management, e.g., by strengthening water supply infrastructure, \ninstitutional capacity, and community engagement. \n \n25.  Weak local capacity to sustain the sound long-term operation of the desalination plant is \ncounteracted through 5-year outsourced O&M contracts, which will be packaged with the works \nand delivered through a DBO contract encompassing both the desalination plant and water supply \nnetwork. The firm responsible for the DBO package will play a critical role in transferring capacity \nto PUB, and this skills transfer will be incorporated into the employer\u2019s requirements. \n \n26.  While desalination is an energy-intensive technology compared with conventional water \ntreatment, the project helps offset the energy consumed by the plant and the network by producing \nrenewable energy through solar photovoltaic technology, significantly reducing the overall O&M \ncost of potable water production.34 A 2015 study concluded that solar photovoltaic-powered \nreverse osmosis desalination is the best renewable energy technology option for South Tarawa.35  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  The project is found to be economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of \n9.1% and an economic net present value of $216,683. Substantial cost savings arise from the \ndesalination  plant\u2019s  use  of  solar  photovoltaic  energy  rather  than  diesel,  and  from  avoided \nhousehold-level treatment (i.e., boiling) before the consumption of water. The reduced incidence\nof waterborne diseases brings down the costs associated with medical care and lost productivity. \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that economic viability worsens across all adverse scenarios, with \nthe project being more sensitive to changes in benefits. A user-pays approach to the water supply \ncomponent will be developed and adopted, with affordability and willingness-to-pay taken into \nconsideration. Further, the government is expected to realize surplus resources sufficient to fund \nO&M expenditures not covered by the proposed project, but the risk to the project\u2019s financial \nsustainability is substantial given the high dependence on budgetary support. To help ensure \nfinancial sustainability, the government has issued a cabinet decision formally committing it to \nmeet, after project implementation, any additional financing that may be needed for the ongoing \noperation of the water supply system. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  The project team assessed project-related governance risks in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nprocurement and financial management requirements.  The overall risk was assessed to be \nmoderate (defined as \u201clikely to occur\u201d) and will have low impact if it occurs. Effective mitigation of \nthese risks will take place through (i) the engagement of a qualified and experienced project \naccountant, who as part of the PMU and based in the Kiribati Fiduciary Services Unit (KFSU) will\nbe responsible for project disbursements, accounting, financial reporting, and record keeping; (ii) \nan action plan to mitigate the risks, which is detailed in the PAM and will be regularly reviewed \nand/or updated to ensure that the project responds dynamically to risks during implementation;  \n(iii) inclusion of these tasks in the terms of reference for the project accountant; (iv) financial \n                                                \nReview Report.

Population growth will result in increased water demand and thus increased energy demand. \n35 International Renewable Energy Agency. 2015. Kiribati Integrated Energy Roadmap Renewable Energy. Working \ndraft, September 2015. \n ", "8 \noversight of the executing and implementing agencies by the KFSU; and (v) the provision of \ntraining to the executing and implementing agencies by ADB\u2019s financial management officer \nduring missions, as needed. \n \n29.  The existence of the KFSU, which operates under a procedures manual prepared by ADB \nin 2015, provides confidence that capacity in the government is adequate to handle project \nprocurement requirements in accordance with ADB procedures. The PMU, with support from the \nfirm recruited through the PDA as well as the project implementation assistance firm, will have \nthe requisite expertise to support the execution of DBO contracts and assist MISE in mitigating \ncontract delays. Project management functions such as procurement, contract administration, \nworks supervision, and project accounting will be assisted by the PMU. These measures are \nsatisfactory to mitigate the procurement risks described above. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 28). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  The provision of safe and sufficient water supplies in South Tarawa will benefit the \npeople\u2019s health by eliminating the current high dependence on contaminated water supplies. The \nreduction in waterborne diseases will avoid the cost of medical treatment, lost productivity of \npatients and caregivers, and loss of lives. Other social benefits of improved water supply include \nimprovements  in  household  income  levels  and  security  of  livelihoods;  increased  school \nattendance; and wider social and cultural benefits such as reduced stress levels, better family \nand community relations, and greater ability to observe religious rites and customs. Women, \nchildren, the elderly, and the most disadvantaged households that now bear a disproportionate \nshare of the burden of inadequate water services in South Tarawa will benefit the most. \n \n32.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan \nwas prepared. Some of the gender targets to be implemented by the project involve establishing \nnew connections in project areas, which will benefit 100% households headed by women; \nproviding quarterly financial literacy training to PUB customers (75% of them women) in 250 \ncommunities to improve their ability to pay for water; ensuring that at least 50% of community \nmobilizers are women; organizing monthly WASH awareness-raising seminars for students, of \nwhom at least 50% are girls; making sure that at least 20% of new recruits to MISE\u2019s Water and \nSanitation Engineering Unit and PUB\u2019s Water Engineering Department are women, and that at \nleast 20% of PUB and MISE staff trained under the project are women; and involving at least 10% \nwomen in community work during civil works and/or employing them during O&M.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  The project team screened and assessed the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009), and plans to mitigate and manage impacts were prepared.36 \n \n34.  Environment (category B). The impacts are largely site-specific, intermittent, and/or \ntemporary  (during  construction),  and  mitigation  measures  can  be  readily  designed  and \nimplemented.  An  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment\u2014equivalent  to  an  initial \n                                                \n36 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n \n ", "9 \nenvironmental examination and appropriate for the category B project\u2014was undertaken and \nincludes an environmental management plan that will be updated based on the detailed design. \nThe environmental and social impact assessment will form the basis of the application for an \nenvironmental license under the country safeguard system. The project management structure \nincludes institutional arrangements to ensure effective implementation of safeguards. \n \n35.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Due  diligence  was  undertaken  to  assess \npotential involuntary resettlement impacts on all the proposed sites. It found that the proposed \nwater supply infrastructure will not have significant involuntary resettlement impacts; impacts are \nconfined to minor land acquisition and/or lease, affecting assets such as crops and trees of an \nestimated 33 persons. The desalination plant is proposed to be constructed on land held by the \ngovernment on a long-term lease, and is not expected to pose any risks during implementation, \nsince the current lease extends until 2040. Government land is generally being sought for the \nlocation of the storage tanks, booster pump station, and solar installations, and only if government \nland is not available will private land be considered. The route for the water supply pipe network \nis expected to align with existing roads but may require some private land. A resettlement \nframework was prepared to guide the preparation of necessary safeguard documents for the \nwater supply network upon confirmation of the exact route and a resettlement plan for the \ndesalination plant, booster pumps, and solar installations.37 Consultations were held with affected \npersons and included the disclosure of draft safeguard documents; they will continue during \nproject implementation. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Kiribati's population is a single indigenous ethnic \ngroup, and the project beneficiaries are not considered distinct and vulnerable.\n \n37.  Since PDA is financing the detailed engineering design for the water supply network, \nsafeguard documents will be updated upon design completion. The project will support positions \nin the PMU for safeguards, which will enhance the institutional capacity of the borrower to manage \nenvironmental and social risks. The PDA and project implementation assistance consultants will \nsupport the PMU and provide capacity building and training as core elements of their terms of \nreference. Pursuant to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, ADB funds may not be applied to the \nactivities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth in Appendix 5 of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment was carried out \nas part of project processing, and climate risks were factored into the infrastructure design. The \nproject will comply with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n38.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.38\n                                                \n37 Beyond the proposed project sites, potential support via regional TA (ADB. 2018.
