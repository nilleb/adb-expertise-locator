INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen capacity and foster \nmultisector  collaboration  in  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs) to promote better integration of water, sanitation, hygiene, and health (WASH+H) to \nprevent, detect, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and other water- \nand  sanitation-related  public  health  emergencies.  The  TA  will  direct  resources  toward  (i) \nsupporting the scaling up and effective integration of COVID-19 infection prevention and control \n(IPC) as well as impact mitigation WASH+H activities into ADB projects in the social sectors (e.g., \nhealth, education, social protection) and in the water and urban sectors (e.g., water supply, \nsanitation, wastewater, and solid waste management); and (ii) promoting multisector and multi-\nstakeholder awareness raising, knowledge and capacity building, policy dialogue, and strategy \ndevelopment. \n \n2.  The TA is part of the ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and is \nincluded in the 2020 ADB Management-approved results-based work plan of ADB\u2019s Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department (SDCC).1 On a demand-driven basis, the TA will \nhelp  ADB\u2019s  water,  social,  and  urban  sector  operations  achieve  Strategy  2030,  particularly \noperational priority 1: addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  COVID-19 economic impact. COVID-19 has been costly to Asian economic growth.3 The \nAsian Development Outlook 2020 latest 2020 COVID-19 impact assessment includes gross \nglobal and regional economic impact estimates.4 Policy responses are thus fundamental in \nassisting Asia and the Pacific to address the economic impacts of COVID-19, and interventions \nthat help restructure the economy toward higher productivity growth should be included among \nthese responses. Investments in the delivery of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services \ncan  minimize  disruptions  to the  economy;  contribute to  resilient  productivity  enhancement, \npromote inclusive growth, equity, and gender equality; and contribute toward the achievement of \nthe Sustainable Development Goals. \n \n4.  COVID-19 infection prevention and control through water, sanitation, and hygiene. \nAs highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, safely managed WASH services, as well as hygiene \nbehaviors, are fundamental to protect human health from infectious disease outbreaks.5 Proper \nhand hygiene is one of the most important IPC measures in the context of COVID-19. The \ncontinuity and sustainability of WASH services and community engagement through (i) enhanced \n \n1  ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila.

An Updated Assessment of \nthe Economic Impacts of COVID-19 as follows: COVID-19 gross global economic impact is estimated at $5.8 to $8.8 \ntrillion (or 6.4% to 9.7% of global gross domestic product) before factoring government policy responses which could \npotentially reduce these estimates by 30% to 40% depending on the duration of the containment scenario. In Asia \nand the Pacific, the potential COVID-19 economic impact is estimated at $1.7 to $2.5 trillion (or 6.2% to 9.3% of \nregional gross domestic product) also depending on the duration of the containment scenario. \n5  G.

About 3 billion people globally and \nnearly three-quarters of people in least-developed countries lack basic home handwashing \nfacilities with water and soap. Globally, almost half of all schools lack handwashing facilities that \ninclude water and soap, affecting 900 million school-age children, and 43% of health care facilities \nlack  hand  hygiene  at  points  of  patient  care.6 Moreover,  studies  consistently  show  (i)  that \nincreasing knowledge of handwashing even in settings where access to reliable water supply \nexists is not sufficient to motivate behavior change, and (ii) that multimodal approaches that \naddress necessary multiple determinants of behavior change are key for hygiene program \ndesigners to take into account.7 \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s  response  to  COVID-19.  As  of October  2020,  ADB  has  already  provided  a \ncomprehensive response package to its DMCs, including projects and technical assistance for \nthe health sector. Consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (footnote 2), ADB\u2019s post-COVID-19 \nsupport to the region prioritizes the protection of human health via COVID-19 IPC measures such \nas universal access to WASH to combat the spread of infectious disease.8 ADB joined world \nleaders and heads of international organizations in responding to the World Health Organization\u2019s \n14 May 2020 call for action on COVID-19 to make WASH available to everyone, eliminating \ninequalities and leaving no one behind, with a special emphasis on the most vulnerable to COVID-\n19, including women and girls.9 The inequitable economic impacts associated with the COVID-19 \npandemic are predicted to disproportionately impact the already poor and vulnerable through \nreduced income, increased risk of all forms of malnutrition, and decreased ability to pay for basic \nservices (including WASH) and cover health care costs.10 \n \n6.   Need for additional assistance. Additional technical and financial resources are required \nto strengthen (i) WASH components and integration of WASH+H in ADB projects; and (ii) the \nenabling environment, knowledge, and capacity to prevent, detect, prepare for, and respond to \nCOVID-19 and other water- and sanitation-related disease outbreaks. The TA for $2 million is \nproposed by the SDCC water and health sector groups to make additional resources available to \nregional departments. The TA aims to promote COVID-19 IPC, resulting in healthier populations \nin Asia and the Pacific through an inclusive, gender-sensitive, effective, and sustainable WASH+H \nprogram, with a particular focus on the poor, marginalized, and vulnerable who have been most \naffected  by  COVID-19.  The  TA  responds  to  the  demands  of  ADB\u2019s  DMCs  and  regional \ndepartments, and is being developed with their consultation and that of other SDCC sector and \nthematic groups. The TA will support ADB regional departments in prioritizing and providing \ncapacity building and advisory services around evidence-based WASH+H-related awareness, \nrisk communication, community engagement and preparedness, and resilience to public health \nshocks (in particular COVID-19) throughout ADB\u2019s DMCs. It will also support multisector and \nmulti-stakeholder collaboration, strategy, and policy development. \n \n \n6  World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water \nSupply, Sanitation and Hygiene. 2020.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: human health aspects in TA beneficiary DMCs \nin Asia and the Pacific supported (footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: uptake of \nCOVID-19 IPC actions in selected DMCs increased.11 This outcome will be achieved through ADB \nand DMCs projects, strategies, and programs. Preliminary countries identified to participate in the \nTA are Bangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Uzbekistan.12 \nConfirmation  of  the  TA  beneficiary  DMCs  will  be  carried  out  during  inception,  and  early \nimplementation of the TA and other countries may be added.13 A separate, already approved, \nregional TA project is covering Pacific DMCs.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Support to projects for COVID-19 infection prevention and control and \nimpact mitigation provided. This output will target the scaling up and effective integration of \nCOVID-19 IPC and impact mitigation-related WASH+H activities into ADB projects through a \nculturally,  socially,  and  gender-sensitive  and  inclusive  approach.  Based  on  demands  from \nregional departments, TA resources will support project preparation and implementation through \nstrengthened WASH+H awareness, evidence-based practices, investments, hygiene behavioral \nchange for COVID-19 IPC, and impact mitigation. Eligible activities include (i) WASH+H needs \nassessments (e.g., at the country and project levels), (ii) infection risk communication, (iii) hygiene \nawareness,  (iv)  community  engagement,  and  (v)  behavior  change  campaigns  and  training \nmaterials development. Assistance from the TA will be in the form of specialists\u2019 inputs and/or \nother advisory and capacity building services, encompassing upstream work (planning phase), \nactual project preparation, and implementation of existing and upcoming projects where required. \nBased on the lessons from the TA implementation, the TA may also support development of a \nguidance note on how best to incorporate WASH+H into future ADB projects, including sample \nterms of reference (TOR) for consultants and sample design and monitoring framework indicators. \nTA outputs can also be used to prepare and implement country-level interventions that can utilize \nand benefit from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction COVID-19 resources. \n \n9.  Output 2: Support for enabling environment, knowledge, and capacity for COVID-\n19 preparedness, management, resilience, and sustainable recovery provided. This output \nwill  support  multisector  and  multi-stakeholder  awareness  raising,  knowledge  and  capacity \nbuilding, policy dialogue, and strategy development. The TA resources under this output will \ninclude activities to (i) raise awareness, strengthen capacity, and promote knowledge sharing and \ntechnological innovation; (ii) identify policy gaps and bottlenecks, and recommend measures to \naddress them; (iii) conduct policy dialogue (e.g., water, sanitation and hygiene, health, urban, \neducation, gender); and (iv) develop frameworks, guidelines, and strategies to improve COVID-\n19 preparedness, management, resilience, and sustainable recovery in DMCs. The output will \nsupport the development of evidence-based tools, knowledge products, and dissemination plans \nfor epidemiological surveillance and utility digitalization, design of innovative pilot projects, peer-\n \n11  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12  These preliminary countries were nominated by ADB\u2019s regional departments. \n13  Through applicable procedures as defined in ADB\u2019s operational policies and Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nguidelines. \n14  ADB. 2020.

Under both outputs, coordination with partners and technical resources in the region \nworking on WASH will be promoted to maximize synergies and avoid duplication.15 To achieve \nthis, implementation of the TA will also require a comprehensive inventory of WASH partners \nworking in participating DMCs to understand who is doing what and where, and to identify areas \nfor convergence and value addition for TA resources.  \n \n11.  Communicating key messages to various stakeholders will play an important role in \nundertaking activities under both outputs. Thus, the TA will also explore various communication \nchannels and platforms that best suit the activities in each participating DMC. Communication \nchannels may include schools, for which collaboration with partners involved in related work will \nbe maximized.16 Communication platforms are expected to include various social media platforms, \nnoting that they are actively used in many countries. However, some target audiences lack \ninternet access, so alternative platforms will have to be developed. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.   The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB.17 The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.   ADB will administer the TA. The Water Sector Group under the Sector Advisory Service \nCluster in SDCC will carry out the TA administration and supervise implementation in close \ncollaboration with the regional departments, including ADB resident missions and other sector \nand thematic groups. SDCC and/or regional departments will select and evaluate consultants, \nprocure  goods,  organize  workshops,  and  provide  staff  to  act  as  resource  persons  in  the \nworkshops as appropriate. \n \n14.
