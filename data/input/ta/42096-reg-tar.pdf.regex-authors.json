Asset and liability management (ALM) refers to the optimal and holistic management of \nthe  balance  sheet  in  financial  institutions  and  industrial  companies,  with  the  objective  of \nmanaging and mitigating risks associated with interest rates, foreign exchange, and liquidity, \namong others. By analyzing and managing the different classes of assets and liabilities, ALM \nalso minimizes the cost of capital and imposes an adequate transfer pricing mechanism within \ninstitutions.  It  ensures  an  entity\u2019s  long-term  financial  health  through  forward-looking \nmanagement of capital adequacy and financial ratios. An ALM committee (ALCO) structure \nprovides the best practice governance model to promote sound financial management at the \nhighest level of corporate management. \n \n2.  This technical assistance (TA)1 is a pilot initiative. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill conduct ALM and risk management workshops for regional clients to help build awareness \nand strengthen financial management capacity. The workshops will facilitate participants to \nlearn about long-term perspectives, contemporary issues related to financial risks, volatility in \nfinancial markets, and how to manage financial risks. The design and monitoring framework is \nattached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Financial institutions in ADB\u2019s client countries have high exposures to interest rate-\nsensitive securities and long-term liabilities with inadequate or non-existent ALM frameworks \nand  practices.  Financial  institutions  in  most  of  ADB\u2019s  client  countries  regularly  take  large \npositions with significant interest rate and currency risks. These institutions also typically have \nlarge mismatches in assets and liabilities. \n \n4.  With a surge in private capital inflows (foreign direct investments, portfolio inflows, and \nbank debt), the financial markets are demanding more transparency in the management of \nfinancial institutions. As was amply demonstrated in 1997 and earlier financial crises, financial \ninstitutions in developing countries with inadequate or no ALM discipline have been ruthlessly \npunished by the financial markets, suffered severe losses, and experienced failures as a result \nof their exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates, asset defaults, and turbulent \nequity markets. In many cases, these risks were unnecessary and could easily have been \navoided with effective ALM. Winning and retaining the confidence of financial markets have \nbecome major objectives of financial institutions. \n \n5.  Domestic financial institutions need better ALM and risk management discipline if they \nare to compete with new global players. Indeed, today, it is inconceivable for any major financial \ninstitution to ignore the international standards and norms such as Basel II. There is a need for \nmuch more attention to be paid to financial stability and risk management both at individual \ninstitutions  and  throughout  the  financial  system.  Basel  II  is  designed  to  improve  risk \nmanagement at individual institutions by covering such issues as capital adequacy, liquidity \nmanagement,  sensitivity  to  market  risk,  foreign  assets  and  liabilities,  domestic  assets  and \nliabilities, and credit risk management. \n \n6.  The ADB Treasury Department manages the assets and liabilities of ADB\u2019s balance \nsheet according to best ALM principles. ADB regularly interacts with investors, rating agencies, \nmajor banks, regulators and peer multilaterals on financial policy and funding (including bond \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 6 March 2008. \n ", "  2\nissuance in domestic capital markets). In addition, the Treasury Department has conducted \nworkshops  for  sovereign  clients  on  (i)  London  interbank  offered  rate-based  loan  products;  \n(ii)  debt  management  products;  (iii)  currency  management;  (iv)  special  drawing  rights \nconversion  offers,  and  (v)  legacy  loan  conversion.  However,  to  date,  there  has  been  no \nextensive  regional  treatment  of  ALM  and  risk  management  issues  involving  nonsovereign \nclients from the financial sector. \n \n7.  ADB (represented by the Treasury Department) is a founding member of the multilateral \ndevelopment bank (MDB)-ALM Forum, which provides participants with a platform to (i) review \nand share their experience of ALM and risk management practices and policies, and (ii) resolve \npractical issues in implementing such policies. ADB actively participates in the annual MDB \nForum, and hosted the 2005 forum in Manila.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The overall goal of this TA is to support participating institutions (mainly nonsovereign \nbanking clients of ADB) to adopt international bank standards and best practices, including \nALM  and  risk  management  policies,  for  critical  banking  operations.  The  TA  will  promote \neffective financial frameworks to manage financial risks and expand financial resources, and \nwill encourage clients to enhance their financial policies, procedures and capabilities for the \neffective management of their assets and liabilities, including mitigation of financial risks in \nresponse to rapid expansion. \n \n9.  The TA will be an extension of the Treasury Department\u2019s new loan products outreach \nprogram. As a pilot initiative, it will (i) enhance ADB\u2019s capacity to deal with ALM and risk \nmanagement issues, (ii) improve ADB\u2019s understanding of the scope and types of assistance \nspecific to ALM and risk management in Asia and the Pacific, and (iii) provide a platform for \nanalyzing key ALM issues and trends, and type of financial instruments and tools used by the \nfinancial participants in managing their ALM risks. \n \n10.  The  TA  has  two  main  expected  outcomes.  First,  by  facilitating  and  promoting  the \nconcept of ALM and ALCO decision-making, it will enable participating institutions to improve \ntheir financial management capacity and practices. Second, cross-border financial interaction on \nbest practices and experiences in ALM will help participants to compete on equal terms and will \nsupport collaborative capacity building in the financial sector (pillar 3 of the regional cooperation \nand integration strategy).2 For example, the workshops will: \n \n(i)  facilitate  cross-learning  and  sharing  of  experiences  on  (a)  local  currency \ninstruments, (b) ALM and risk management, (c) resource mobilization, (d) capital \nadequacy management, and (e) valuation of illiquid assets; and \n(ii)  share  ALM  issues  related  to  foreign  currency  exposure  using  financial \ninstruments  (including  derivatives)  commonly  available  in  developed  financial \nmarkets.  \n \n11.  Domestic commercial banks (including nonbank financial institutions and capital market \nparticipants) in many ADB developing member countries (DMCs) could provide long-term debt \nfinancing for certain projects (such as in providing long-term local currency financing at fixed \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration. Manila. \n ", "  3\ninterest rate for infrastructure projects). However, prudent financial risk management and ALM \npractices have to be adopted before such forms of financing can be provided on a sustained \nbasis. \n \n12.  Trade finance, swaps, and other transactions between international and domestic banks, \nand  among  domestic  banks,  require  the  establishment  of  \u201cbank  limits\u201d  based  on  credit \nassessments and ratings. By helping participating DMC banks and other financial institutions \nadopt ALM and risk management practices that are in line with international best standards, the \nTA will encourage these banks to prove that they deserve larger and longer-term bank limits, \nand give comfort to international banks that it is prudent to provide such limits especially during \nthe current period of tightening liquidity and risk aversion. \n \n13.  Banking  institutions  can  manage  financial  risk  through  (i)  hedging  instruments,  \n(ii) promoting the proper utilization of capital through transfer pricing, and (iii) using economic \ncapital and risk sharing through securitization to best utilize capital. Financial institutions need to \nimprove their creditworthiness and to put in place more transparent accounting, risk assessment \nand risk management practices before attracting national, regional and international investors.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will be implemented in consultation with the ADB Private Sector Operations \nDepartment, regional departments (governance and finance divisions), the Office of Regional  \nEconomic Integration, and the Risk Management Unit to (i) identify resource speakers and \nparticipants from various countries for the ALM and risk management forum; and (ii) achieve an \nappropriate mix of (a) smaller and less sophisticated banks (including local and/or domestic \nbanks); (b) larger and more sophisticated banks; and (c) knowledgeable clients to share their \nexperiences and expertise in areas of implementation and regulation.  \n \n15.  Participants  and  topics  will  be  carefully  managed  so  the  TA  can  be  successfully \nimplemented  within  a  limited  budget.  Workshops  may  be  grouped  by  focus  areas,  or  by \nparticipants. Each workshop will include participants across various DMCs to ensure that cross-\ncountry benefits are achieved.  \n \n16.  Resource speakers will be invited from regional regulators, rating agencies, medium-\nsized  financial  institutions,  multilateral  development  banks,  financial  associations,  and  risk \nmanagement associations. The international consultant and the responsible ADB member of \nstaff will ensure that the agenda and materials are properly designed. The target audience from \nnonsovereign participants will include financial practitioners from financial institutions ADB either \nhas worked with or may work with. Participants should be ALM or risk management practitioners \nwith at least 3 years of working experience and should be fluent in written and spoken English. \n \n17.  Best practices and case studies will be disseminated through the ADB website. The TA \nmay identify a potential sponsor or sponsors from the region who will champion ALM and risk \nmanagement financial capacity building as a center of knowledge. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $320,000. The TA will be \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nadministered  by  ADB  and  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Regional  Cooperation  and \n ", "  4\nIntegration  Fund  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Financing  Partnership \nFacility.3 The detailed cost estimates and financing plans are in Appendix 2.4 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the Executing Agency. ADB, through the Treasury Department, will be \nresponsible  for  the  overall  management  and  monitoring  of  the  TA  activities,  including \nsupervising the work of the TA consultants. One international consultant will work on a retainer \nbasis  for  a  total  of  up  to  6  person-months,  and  may  be  assisted  by  a  part-time  national \nconsultant for up to 6 person-months. The consultants will be engaged by ADB as individual \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The TA will: \n \n(i)  be implemented from September 2008 to December 2009; \n(ii)  include two or three workshops (at ADB headquarters and/or regional financial \nhubs) with 30 participants each; \n(iii)  produce a summary of issues raised to be shared among the participants; \n(iv)  post case studies on the ADB website and publish them in financial magazines; \nand  \n(v)  use the ADB C-cube system to share information on ALM and risk management \nissues. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $320,000 on a grant basis \nfor Supporting Regional Capacities for Financial Asset and Liability and Risk Management, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n3   Established by ADB. \n4   Any activity in a member country would commence after ADB has received, in writing, no objections to its inclusion \nin the regional TA. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources/Reporting   \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n\u2022  Assist clients in enhancing their financial  \u2022  Corporate  governance  in  \u2022  Case  studies  shared  with  \u2022  Speakers  and  participants  are \nmanagement  policies,  procedures  and  participating  clients  improved.  participants  and  articles  knowledgeable  and  provide  sufficient \ncapabilities in the effective management  Participants  appreciate  the  published  in  financial  response during discussions and feedback. \nof their assets and liabilities, including the  importance of best ALM and risk  magazines  and  on  ADB   \nmitigation  of  their  financial  risks  in  management practices and agree  website.
