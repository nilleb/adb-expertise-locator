During the operational missions of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 2004, the \nGovernment of Viet Nam requested continued assistance to upgrade the power transmission \nnetwork in the northern part of the country to meet the expected future demand growth. A \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Northern Power Transmission Expansion \nProject is included in ADB\u2019s 2005\u20132007 country strategy and program update and an ensuing \nloan project is included for 2005. An ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam from 9 to 13 \nAugust 2004 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objective, scope, cost, \nfinancing, implementation arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 outline terms of reference for the \nTA.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam was one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies in 2003. The gross domestic \nproduct growth of 7.1% was underpinned by strong domestic demand and export growth.2 As a \nresult of sustained high economic growth during the 1990s, poverty declined from 58% of the \npopulation in 1993 to around 29% in 2002. Medium-term annual growth rates are targeted at \naround 7\u20138%. Economic diversification, industrial development, and employment creation will \nbe key in sustaining high economic growth and achieving continued rapid reduction in poverty.  \n \n3.  As a result of high economic growth and initial low levels of electricity consumption, \ndemand for electricity has been growing at around 14% annually since the early 1990s. With \ncontinued high rates of economic growth, electricity demand will continue to grow at high rates \nin the medium term. This growth in demand is driven mainly by residential and industrial \nsectors. Due to a rapid expansion of household access to electricity and increasing incomes, \nresidential demand grew by 19% annually during the last decade. Industrial demand grew at \naround 13% annually during the same period. With continued modernization and diversification \nof the economic base, industrial demand is expected to grow rapidly by over the next two \ndecades. \n \n4.  Ensuring that sufficient capacity in generation, transmission, and distribution is available \nto meet electricity demands is a key challenge facing the power sector. With sustained high \neconomic growth rates, the 2001 Master Plan for Power Development for Viet Nam (5th Master \nPlan) was revised in October 2002 to account for updated investment requirements resulting \nfrom  increased  power  demand  projections.  Total  nationwide  investment  requirements  for \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution are estimated at $19.1 billion for the period 2002\u2013\n2010. \n \n5.  The northern region is the fastest growing region in the country, particularly around the \ndevelopment triangle of Hanoi, Hai Phong, and Quang Ninh provinces. This area has also \nexperienced a rapid decline in poverty rates. The annual demand growth of 12% in the northern \nregion has been driven by a rapid expansion of manufacturing and export industries and by \nincreased  household  incomes.  Industrial  and  residential  sectors  have  experienced  annual \ngrowth rates of 10% and 18%, respectively, over the last decade. With growing investments in \nthe development triangle, industrial demand growth is projected to increase by nearly 55% over \nthe  period  2005\u20132010.  To  meet  the  demand  in  growth  demand  in  the  northern  region, \ninvestment requirements of the power sector are estimated at $5.6 billion over the period 2004\u2013\n2010.  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 30 June 2004. \n2 ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132007): Viet Nam. Manila. \n ", "2  \n6.  Interregional trade has been relatively limited. Currently, the northern region accounts for \nabout 37% of the country\u2019s generation capacity and 39% of total electricity consumption. To \nintroduce  more  flexibility  and  meet  power  demand  growth  in  the  development  triangle,  a \nbackbone north-south 500 kilovolt (kV) double-circuit transmission network, aimed at securing \nsufficient wheeling of power from the south to the north, is under construction and expected to \nbe completed by the end of 2005. The proposed Northern Power Transmission Sector Project, \nscheduled for ADB Board approval by the 4th quarter of 2004, will assist Electricity of Vietnam \n(EVN)  in  expanding  and  upgrading  the  500  kV  and  220  kV  transmission  systems  and \nsubstations to transfer additional power to improve system reliability and enhance the utilization \nof existing and new power plants. The proposed Northern Power Transmission Expansion \nSector Project was identified as a result of the updated investment needs assessment in the \nrevised  5th  Master  Plan.  The  project  will  address  additional  investment  needs  in  the \ntransmission  network  required  to  ensure  system  reliability  and  meet  the  revised  demand \nprojections in the northern region of Viet Nam. \n \n7.  To support the Government in meeting its reform objectives, ADB approved a TA for \npower sector reform3 that defined a time-bound action plan for restructuring of the power sector. \nA key requirement of the action plan is to reform the legal system. Legal and regulatory reform \naims  to  provide  a  consistent  legal  basis  to  facilitate  commercial  sector  operations  and \nGovernment oversight of the sector by (i) promulgating a primary Electricity Law; (ii) developing \nsupporting secondary legislation to the Electricity Law to address (a) the scope and structure of \nthe regulatory agency, (b) procedures for tariff setting and regulation, and (c) administrative \nregulations and standards; and (iii) preparing a grid code for interconnection and operating \nstandards between generation entities and the transmission entity.  \n \n8.  The key steps taken by the Government include (i) approval of the draft Electricity Law \nby a high-level electricity law steering committee; and (ii) a decision to corporatize all EVN-\nowned power plants as limited-liability companies, except those with multi-purpose functions \n(irrigation and flood control), to prepare EVN for single-buyer operations and ultimately, a pool-\nbased market system. The draft Electricity Law has been discussed in the National Assembly \nand is expected to be promulgated during 2004. The decree on the creation of a regulatory \nagency will be finalized within 6 months of the enactment of the Electricity Law. On this basis, \nthe proposed Northern Power Transmission Expansion Sector Project would continue to support \nefficient and viable investments in the power sector required to sustain Viet Nam\u2019s economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA will support the Government\u2019s power sector investment program in the northern \nregion by assisting in the preparation of a power transmission expansion project to ensure a \nsufficient and stable power supply to end-consumers. The project will build on and expand \nADB\u2019s proposed Northern Power Transmission Sector Project and serve to strengthen and \nexpand the transmission network in the north. The project will continue to support improvements \nin system stability and security, loss reduction, and improvements in the reliability of supply. The \nidentified subprojects include (i) installation of a second transformer at 500 kV at Thuong Tin \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Road Map for Power Sector Reform. \nManila. ", "  3\nsubstation; (ii) installation of a second transformer at 220 kV at Van Tri substation; (iii) Son La-\nHoa Binh-Nho Quan 500 kV transmission line (260 kilometer [km]); (iv) Son La\u2013Soc Son 500 kV \ntransmission line (260 km); (v) Quang Ninh-Mong Duong 500 kV transmission line (25 km); (vi) \nHa  Tinh-Thach  Khe  220  kV  transmission  line  (9  km);  and  (vii)  Thanh  Hoa-Vinh  220  kV \nTransmission line (120 km, second circuit). The technical assistance framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The activities under the TA will cover the following areas: (i) technical design; (ii) least-\ncost  analysis;  (iii)  update  of  economic  and  financial  analyses,  projections,  including  risk \nanalysis;  and  (iv)  compliance  with  ADB's  safeguard  policies.  In  addition,  the  financial \nmanagement of EVN and the latest developments in power sector reforms and restructuring of \nEVN will be reviewed.  \n \n11.  Load forecasts and generation alternatives will be the basis for least-cost technical \ndesign of subprojects. Feasibility studies will be reviewed, and procurement implementation and \narrangements  will  be  prepared,  including  contract  packaging  and  project  implementation \nschedule.  \n \n12.  Since the proposed individual subprojects, which will not yield benefits if considered in \nisolation, form part of a regional power investment program covering the period 2004\u20132010, the \neconomic and financial analyses of project will include updating the existing macro time-slice \nmodel and preparing a distributional analysis for the northern power investment program. The \nconsultants will analyze the implications of various delay scenarios of generation plants for \nfinancial and economic results. Progress in economic cost recovery relating to the tariff structure \nand the extent of cross-subsidization between major consumer groups will be reviewed. In \naddition to financial analysis of the project, the financial management capabilities and the \nfinancial performance of EVN will be reviewed and updated using EVN\u2019s independent creditors \nmodel.  \n \n13.  To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies on the environment and involuntary \nresettlement, detailed field surveys along the planned alignment of the transmission lines, at the \nsites  of  the  two  substations  for  expansion,  and  of  the  necessary  access  roads  will  be \nundertaken to identify environmental impacts and to prepare a full inventory of all land and other \naffected  assets  and  a  socioeconomic  assessment  of  project-affected  households.  All \ninformation  will  be  gender  disaggregated.  A  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  for  core \nsubprojects as well as a resettlement framework to guide in preparing subprojects under the \nloan.  The  resettlement  plan  will  include  necessary  compensation  and  income  restoration \nmeasures, most suitable implementation arrangements, design of public information, disclosure \nand grievance procedures, and costing of compensation and income-restoring measures. An \ninitial  environmental  examination  and  a  summary  initial  environmental  examination  will  be \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for environmental assessment for sector loans. \nSubprojects will be assessed according to ADB\u2019s guidelines and environmental assessment and \nreview procedures, criteria for subprojects for the loan will be established.  Field visits to collect \ndata will be conducted and public consultations in each province will be held and documented. \n \n14.  Before starting any resettlement and environment planning activities, the consultants will \nconduct social safeguard orientation workshops for the Executing Agency (EA) and other \nagencies involved in resettlement planning e.g. provincial and district resettlement committees. \nTo improve the resettlement planning process, the EA and its domestic consultants and the \n ", "4  \nresettlement  committees  will  receive  formal  and  on-the-job  training  in  inventory  of  loss, \ncollecting  and  analyzing  social  survey  data,  and  in  conducting  consultations  with  affected \npeople.  In  addition,  an  orientation  workshop  on  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nrequirements will be launched by ADB staff, with detailed introduction on ADB\u2019s requirements, \nguidelines, and policies for sector loans.  Relevant Government of Viet Nam authorities (e.g., \nthe Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment) will be invited to briefly preview the \nGovernment\u2019s safeguard requirements. The workshop will be targeted toward relevant staff of \nEVN, Northern Viet Nam Power Project Management Board (NPPMB), and power engineering \nconsulting companies (PECCs). In addition, on-the-job training in environment and resettlement \nactivities will be provided throughout the implementation of the TA.  \n \n15.  A detailed poverty analysis of the sector was undertaken under the project preparatory \nTA for the Northern Power Transmission Project. As that sector work is considered up-to-date \nand given that the expected benefits will not target particular beneficiaries, the poverty analysis \nwill include a review of existing work, and where necessary, update the analysis of affordability \nof up-front connection costs and tariffs.  The project is not expected to cause any specific \ncultural or social effects on any socioeconomic group, including ethnic minority people, or \nexclude any from benefiting from the proposed investment project. Therefore, no specific ethnic \nminority development plan is expected to be required. However, the social analysis will include \nfield consultations in the project areas, targeting the most vulnerable groups including ethnic \nminority people to examine affordability of electricity consumption and connection costs. The \nsummary initial social and poverty analysis is provided as Appendix 2. \n \n16.  Since the Son La\u2013Hoa Binh\u2013Nho Quan and the Son La\u2013Soc Son 500 kV transmission \nlines will evacuate power from Son La and Huoi Quang hydropower generation plants, a sector \nproject  approach  for  the  ensuing  loan  will  introduce  sufficient  flexibility  in  the  event  that \ngeneration projects are significantly delayed.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange cost is $401,000 and the local currency cost is $249,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost \nand a portion of the local currency cost amounting to $99,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment will finance the remaining $150,000 equivalent of local currency costs through in-\nkind contributions of the executing and implementing agencies (IA), and partly from the EVN-\nowned PECCs, and the Institute of Energy. The contribution will include office accommodation \nand facilities, local communication, counterpart staff, data and other information needed for the \nTA. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that ADB\u2019s \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  EVN, as the EA for the TA, has nominated NPPMB to be the IA. NPPMB has adequate \nexperience with implementing externally funded projects of similar nature. PECC1, PECC2, and \nPECC4 are carrying out the feasibility studies for the transmission lines and substations, while \nthe Institute of Energy is responsible for system planning and for preparing of load forecasts. \nThe TA consultants will work closely with those agencies and have full access to all documents \nand data required for TA implementation. EVN will make sufficient counterpart funds available, \nincluding those for transport and for field visits of counterpart staff. EVN will also give all ", "  5\nnecessary assistance to the TA consultants in liaising with other Government ministries and \nagencies  and  provincial  authorities,  and  in  obtaining  necessary  data  and  documentation, \nincluding high-quality detailed maps for routing of transmission lines and location of substations.  \nEVN will liaise with the provinces affected by the proposed investment project to ensure that \ncounterpart staff are nominated before the TA consultants are fielded.  \n \n19.  The TA will require about 11.5 person-months of international and 8.5 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services. It will be implemented over 7-months commencing in February \n2004 with expected completion in August 2005. Outline terms of reference for the consultant are \nin Appendix 4. At the initial stage of implementation, a workshop for provincial and district \nresettlement committees will be held to discuss the work to be undertaken by the consultants \nand ADB\u2019s requirements related to resettlement. Tripartite meetings involving EVN and NPPMB \nwill be held after the submission of the inception, interim, and draft final reports. The consultants \nwill prepare status reports for the specific scope of their works, highlighting any issues that \ncould become critical to the timely completion of the TA. The consultants will arrange for other \nworkshops and on-the-job training for EVN and NPPMB staff and domestic consultants and for \nprovincial and district resettlement committees as necessary.  \n \n20.  The  proposed  subprojects  are  key  investments  for  the  northern  power  investment \nprogram for the period 2004\u20132010. It is essential that the proposed transmission lines be \ncommissioned at the same time as the power plants to ensure optimal economic efficiency of \nboth subproject investments. The loan has therefore been included in the 2005 project pipeline. \nEarly implementation of the TA is important for meeting key project processing deadlines to \nensure timely investments. The scope of work to be conducted for this TA is a follow-up to the \nwork undertaken in the TA study for the proposed Northern Power Transmission Sector Project. \nThe firm, that successfully undertook the previous TA study, has intimate knowledge of the data, \nmodels, and the basis for the calculations for the 2004\u20132010 investment program, having \ndeveloped much of the data and models itself. Since the work will involve revising and updating \ndata for the same investment program and the same time period, it would be more efficient if the \nsame firm were engaged to undertake the work under this TA.4 Therefore, that firm will be \nengaged by direct selection methods (ref. PAI 2.04, para. 10). The consulting firm will be \nengaged  by  ADB in accordance with its  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging of domestic consultants. All procurement under \nthe TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement. The consultants will \nprocure the equipment needed in the Project. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the Northern Power Transmission Expansion Sector \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n4  It is expected that any future ADB involvement in the sector would be an investment program for the entire country \nand for a different time period. Therefore, direct selection of the same firm for this TA will not disadvantage other \nfirms in future ADB work in this sector.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets  and Risks \nGoal       \nTo stimulate economic  Sectoral gross  GDP sector and trade data \ndiversification and  domestic product   \nsustain rapid economic  (GDP) indicators   \ngrowth in the northern     \nregion of Viet Nam and     \nthereby contribute to     \njob creation and     \npoverty reduction     \n  Economic growth  Macroeconomic growth \nindicators  data \n   \nCountry and regional  Socioeconomic living \npoverty incidence data  standard surveys \nPurpose of Project      Assumptions: \nExpanded and  Network capacity  System operations reports  Economic growth and \nstrengthened northern      electricity demand growth in \nelectricity network      accordance with projections \n      in the revised 5th Master \n      Plan  \n       \nImproved performance  Adoption and  Asian Development Bank  Government commitment to \nof Electricity of Viet  implementation of  (ADB) review missions  sector reforms \nNam (EVN) and the  sector policy decisions   \npower sector     \n     \nExpanded and  Number of consumers  EVN\u2019s consumer base \nimproved quality of  by consumer and tariff  data \nelectricity services to all  categories   \nconsumers, including     \nthe poor      \n   \nSystem indicators  System operations reports \nOutputs of Project      Assumptions: \nPreparatory Technical       \nAssistance (PPTA)       \nProject economic,  Monthly progress  Consultants\u2019 submission of  Government support, timely \nfinancial, and technical  reports  reports  counterpart funding, and \nfeasibility report of      staff participation \nidentified subprojects in       \nthe northern region       \n       \nFinancial management  Inception report  Tripartite meetings  Data availability \nreport of EVN       \nProject compliance with     \nenvironmental, social,     \nand resettlement   \nsafeguards,   \nrequirements, and   \nprocedures   \n   \nImproved capacity for  Interim report \nContinued on next page", "Appendix 1  7 \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets  and Risks \nsocial and   \nenvironmental   \nassessment and   \nplanning   \nDraft final and final \nreports \nActivities of the PPTA       \nTechnical assessments  Monthly progress  Consultants\u2019 submission of  Government support, timely \nand design  reports  reports  counterpart funding, and \n      staff participation \n       \n       \nEconomic and financial  Inception report  ADB review missions  Data availability \nfeasibility study of the     \ninvestment program     \n     \nFinancial management  Interim report  Tripartite meetings \nassessment of EVN   \n  Draft final and final \nStakeholder workshops  reports \n(environment,   \nresettlement) \n \nCapacity building \n(resettlement and \nenvironment) \n \nSocioeconomic surveys \nand consultations \n(resettlement and \nsocial) \n \nEnvironmental surveys \nand consultations \n \nTripartite meetings \nInputs of the PPTA       \nConsulting services  Timely submission of  Consultants\u2019 submission of  Qualified consultants \n  consultant\u2019s reports  reports   \n     \nCounterpart staff  ADB review missions  Counterpart staff \n    commitment \nADB staff  Tripartite meetings   \n \n \n \n \n     \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.

Nationwide \nelectricity coverage is a key objective in the Government\u2019s strategy to reduce poverty and vulnerability. The \npercentage of households with access to electricity services increased from 49% in 1992 to 86% in 2002. \nDemand for electricity has increased substantially in the last decade. Increasing incomes and reduced \npoverty have made household appliances and electricity services affordable. However, annual per capita \nconsumption remains among the lowest in Asia at about 321 kilowatt-hours (kWh). Utilization in households \nis even lower, about 158 kWh per year or 13 kWh per month. \nReliable and good quality electricity supply is key for sustaining rapid economic growth and poverty \nreduction. Reliable power supply is important for continued diversification toward a modern and \nindustrialized economy, which will bring about employment, increased productivity and wage increases in \nthe agriculture, and service sectors. \nB.

Since this analysis is up-to-date \nand covers the same region, the poverty analysis will include a review of existing sector work on poverty \nissues, and where required, data updates on affordability of connection costs and tariffs. The poverty \nanalysis will be supplemented by a distributional analysis of the net economic benefits of the investment \nprogram, which the proposed project would support. In addition, social field assessments will further \ninvestigate and ensure that affordability of connection costs and monthly electricity bills among the most \nvulnerable, including ethnic minorities, is appropriately assessed.      \nC.
