THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Macroeconomic context. India has been one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies \nduring the last 5 years with average gross domestic product growth (at constant prices) of 6.8% \nfrom  FY2014\u2013FY2019.1 However,  economic  growth  decelerated  since  the  first  quarter  of \nFY2018\u2013FY2019 and slowed further following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19). The economy is estimated to contract by 9.0% in FY2020\u2013FY2021, although it is expected \nto recover by 8% in FY2021\u2013FY2022.2 The pandemic introduced many uncertainties on the \nmedical, economic, social, and employment fronts. The proposed technical assistance (TA) \nfacility will support processing of future lending projects and stand-alone TA projects to facilitate \nstrategic studies and implement pilot projects related to the digital economy. These will support \nIndia\u2019s post-COVID-19 economic recovery.  \n \n2.  Renewed  attention  to  industrialization,  trade,  and  economic  growth.  The \nGovernment  of  India  (the  Government)  has  adopted  an  all-encompassing  industrialization \nstrategy to improve economic growth and boost international trade. It is improving the availability \nof capital by including micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) lending in priority sector \nlending, changing the definition of MSMEs,3 and introducing a range of MSME financing schemes. \nThe Government is also improving its infrastructure for coastal logistics and industrial corridors \nthrough the Sagarmala program, advancing the ease of doing business with state-level reforms \nto address regulatory bottlenecks; and enhancing access to affordable and sustainable energy \nthrough the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission that targets establishment of 100GW of \nsolar energy generation capacity by 2022 and the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana scheme to \nmodernize distribution networks and institutions. To mitigate the adverse impact of the COVID-\n19, the Government launched the Self-Reliant India4 initiative in May 2020, which complement \nthe Make in India5 drive initiated in 2014 and promote bold measures in several sectors\u2014coal, \nmining, power, and civil aviation. Most importantly, the initiative encourages small and large \nenterprises to innovate and grow.  \n \n3.  Challenges  in  public  sector  management.  The  Government  has  progressively \nintroduced reforms in public resource management and governance at the central and state \nlevels. While some progress has been made, the pace of reforms was not uniform across states. \nThe COVID-19 and resulting deteriorated fiscal profile has intensified the need for better public \nmanagement and more effective public service delivery, calling for strengthening reforms to (i) \nimprove public financial management (PFM) systems in lagging states, (ii) deepen structural \nreforms in progressive states, (iii) explore additional fiscal space, and (iv) ensure the effectiveness \nand sustainability of fiscal measures taken in response to the COVID-19.  \n \n1  The World Bank. 2020. World Development Indicators (accessed 12 October 2020). \n2  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook Update (accessed 22 October 2020). The World Bank projects India\u2019s \neconomy to contract by 9.6% in FY2020\u201321. \n3  Ministry of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises. 2020. Ministry of MSME gears up to implement the New Norms of \nClassification of MSMEs (accessed 16 November 2020). The Government in June 2020 decided an upward revision \nof the MSME definition. It has also decided to include both investments made and turnover of the MSMEs in the \ndefinition. \n4  Self-Reliant India was announced with a number of initiatives for government reforms, business development and \nsector specific measures, aiming to make the country resilient against growing competition from the world and to \nsupport the vulnerable segments of the society that are adversely affected by COVID-19. \n5  Make in India is a Government of India initiative to facilitate India\u2019s position as a global manufacturing hub. It is to \nattract investment and encourage innovation in the manufacturing sector, in addition to skills  enhancement, \nintellectual property rights protection and infrastructure development.  \n \n ", " \n2 \n4.  Finance sector needs further strengthening. Although the finance sector in India is \nmore advanced than in other South Asian countries, effectiveness of financial intermediation \nneeds to be further enhanced to meet the requisite long-term financing for economic and social \ninfrastructures, as well as for risk capital to support entrepreneurial activities, to move to the next \nstage of economic development. Continued efforts are needed to ensure banking sector stability, \npromote innovative banking practices, and develop a broader and deeper capital market. The \nGovernment\u2019s financial and regulatory support is necessary to stimulate private sector financing \nin the current market environment where investors are risk-averse because of COVID-19. \n \n5.  Growing importance of Digital India for inclusive outcomes. India is on its path to \ndigital transformation through the Digital India program.6 The country is working on improving \nfinancial inclusion for the poor and vulnerable through digital payment systems. COVID-19 has \nfurther emphasized the need to digitize payments for safe and efficient economic transactions. \nThe National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), incorporated in 2008, has been authorized \nto partner with the banking sector to operationalize the electronic payment and settlement \nsystems. It introduced, digital payment systems, such as the Aadhaar7 enabled Payment System \nand BHIM Aadhaar, to increase accessibility and adoptability of banking services amongst \nunderserved  citizens  and  merchants.  Many  other  innovative  solutions8 are  currently  under \ndiscussion to increase adoption of digital payments among a broad range of stakeholders, raising \npotential to drive the government\u2019s financial inclusion program.  \n6.  ADB\u2019s solutions-oriented approaches: industries and trade. Under ADB\u2019s Country \nPartnership Strategy (CPS) for India 2018\u20132022,9 ADB operations have increasingly focused on \ndelivering a comprehensive solutions, such as supporting the development of economic corridors \nby improving the investment climate and integrating a range of infrastructure developments\u2014\ntransport  and  public  services  for  urban  areas,  industries,  and  trade\u2014with  regulatory  and \ninstitutional reforms. Programs in this area are extended to multiple states, aiming to enhance \ndomestic economic competitiveness for participation in global value chains. \n \n7.  Public sector management and finance sector development. The CPS envisages \nsupporting several states to strengthen public expenditure management, domestic resource \nmobilization, and monitoring and evaluation. It also emphasizes on catalyzing private sector \nfinancing  for  infrastructure  projects  through  finance  sector  development.  ADB  had  earlier \ndeveloped a successful business model to enhance financial intermediations through the India \nInfrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) and Indian Renewable Energy Development \nAgency  Limited  (IREDA)  to  finance  projects  particularly  under  public\u2013private  partnership \narrangements.10 Further promotion of the successful business model to non-traditional sectors, \nsuch as health care, is currently being explored, along with programs to design innovative \nfinancial  schemes and instruments  such  as  credit  enhancement  products for  infrastructure \ninvestments, to crowd-in private sector financing, drawing expertise from ADB\u2019s Private Sector \n \n6  The program is launched in 2015 to improve digital and/or internet infrastructure to ensure that the government \nservices are available to people electronically. \n7  An identity number for the citizens of India-based on citizen\u2019s biometric and demographic details.  \n8  Some of these include fintech-based cashback solutions for small and marginal farmers to overcome deficiencies in \nsubsidy schemes and entrench use of digital payment, iris-based biometric authentication solution to overcome \nissues around fingerprint mismatch, innovative programs to bring street food vendors on eCommerce platforms. \n9  ADB. 2017.

Digital solutions. Given the growing demand for fintech-based payment systems and \nother  digital  solutions, ADB  operations  may  align  with  the relevant Government\u2019s financial \ninclusion programs. Building on the existing partnership with NPCI,11 ADB may further support \npilot projects and analytical studies to expand the digital program. This may help to comprehend \nthe  benefits  and  challenges  of  emerging  digital  schemes  for  microfinance  institutions, \nmicroenterprises, and other entities; and assist in designing improved and scaled up facilities to \nprovide better digital business solutions for small vendors. \n9.  The TA facility. The TA is listed in the country operations business plan (COBP), 2020\u2013\n2022.12 It will support the preparation of the investment projects included in the India COBPs and \nassociated studies as requested by the implementing agencies and cleared by the Department of \nEconomic  Affairs  (DEA),  covering  the  sectors  of  industries  and  trade,  public  resource \nmanagement, finance, and digital solutions.  \n \n10.  The TA facility approach is suitable as many of these projects are in the same sector\u2014i.e. \nfinance  or  industry  and  trade\u2014and  thus  have  similar  requirements  for  preparation  and \nimplementation. The TA will help (i) enhance the efficiency of project preparation and improve \nreadiness for projects with limited processing resources; (ii) create synergies across projects; (iii) \nshare experiences from different states working with the same team of consultants; (iv) enable \nexchange  of  knowledge  and  ideas  for  project  processing,  and  design  and  implementation \nreadiness; and (iv) strengthen coordination among various technical inputs and capacity building \nopportunities. Overall, the TA will reduce transaction and time costs compared to the resources \nrequired for separate stand-alone transaction TA projects.  \n \n11.  Finance Plus. For the success of public sector management, finance, and multisector \ndevelopment projects, it is critical to provide policy advice to key stakeholders based on upstream \nstrategic studies, and to develop downstream program execution mechanisms with capacity \ndevelopment support for implementing agencies. The TA will provide additional resources for both \nupstream  and  downstream  preparatory  work  to  improve  the  quality  of  project  design  and \nreadiness.  \n \nB.   Outputs and Activities \n \n12.  The TA will have the following three outputs to support the preparation of ensuing projects. \n \n13.  Output 1: Quality project design achieved. The TA will provide technical expertise to \nundertake diagnostic studies for efficient designing of potential ADB-funded projects. The scope \nof activities will include (i) analytical studies, such as sector assessment, gap analysis, demand \nassessment through surveys, and stakeholder analysis; (ii) identification of priority projects\u2019 \nscopes and activities; (iii) support to small-scale pilot projects; (iv) climate risk screening and/or \nclimate change assessment and climate risk and vulnerability assessment; and (v) feasibility \nstudies as required for the ensuing projects. \n \n14.  Output 2: Quality due diligence achieved. The TA will provide technical expertise for \nprocurement risk assessment, financial management assessment, financial analysis, economic \n \n11 ADB. 2020.

Output 3: Capacity of implementing agencies strengthened. The TA will provide \ntechnical expertise and capacity building to selected implementing agencies for future projects to \nenhance the implementation and sustainability of investments. Consultants will provide  the \nsupport and will focus on enhancing the quality of project implementation and monitoring by \nsupporting additional surveys and/or studies, seminars, workshops, and on-the-job training for \nstaff from executing and implementing agencies across multiple projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 1. The TA facility\u2019s scope will encompass other activities that are not covered by the \nassociated TA projects of ensuing projects and will be consistent with the ensuing TA projects\u2019 \noutputs and outcomes.  \n \n17.  The government agencies responsible for each project will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of counterpart staff, office space, office supplies, project-related information, and other \nin-kind contributions. The Government was informed that the approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The DEA in the Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency of the TA facility. \nGovernment departments or agencies responsible for each project will be the implementing \nagencies for the TA, subject to the approvals of the DEA and ADB. ADB will administer the TA \nfacility through the Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division of the South Asia \nDepartment and will work closely with the executing and implementing agencies of the ongoing \nand planned pipeline projects. The Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division will \nselect, administer, evaluate, and supervise the consultants\u2019 outputs for the projects, and work with \nthe relevant line departments for all activities related to the TA.  \n \n19.  The TA facility will be implemented from January 2021 to December 2023. Disbursements \nunder the TA facility will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \n  \n20.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2021\u2013December 2023 \nExecuting agency  Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance \n \n ", " \n5 \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementing agencies  The agencies that are preparing ensuing projects or implementing \nongoing projects. For practical purposes, the TA will be managed by \nADB in close coordination with implementing agencies. \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Individual: ICS  (14 person-months)  $224,000 \n(international) \n  Individual: ICS  (27 person-months)  $189,000 \n(national) \nDisbursement  The  TA  resources  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to \ntime). \nAsset turnover or disposal  None. \narrangement upon TA \ncompletion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, TA = technical assistance.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n21.  Consulting services. The TA facility will provide an initial 41 person-months of consulting \nservices  (14  person-months  international  and  27  person-months  national)13 to  support  the \npreparation of projects. The consultants will be recruited using individual consultant selection \nbased on the requirements of each project being prepared or implemented. Individual consultant \nselection, rather than firm selection, is considered appropriate because the TA facility involves \nmultiple activities that are not necessarily interdependent and will require a varied range of \nconsultants  and  services.  However,  where  suitable,  recruitment  through  a  firm  might  be \nconsidered. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff \ninstructions.14  \n \nE.  Governance \n \n22.  Because  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  facility,  the  risks  to  financial  management, \nprocurement capacity, and integrity during the TA facility implementation are assessed to be low. \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nIndia for Enhancing Capacity to Design and Implement Public Resource Management, Finance, \nand Multisector Development Projects, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n13 The TA facility savings may be used for additional consultant inputs, if necessary. \n14 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Amount \nA.
