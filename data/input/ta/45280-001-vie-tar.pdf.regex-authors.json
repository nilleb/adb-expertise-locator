INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Based on the findings and recommendations of the 2011 Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncountry  portfolio  performance  review  and  other  official  development  assistance  (ODA) \nmanagement forums in Viet Nam, such as the Consultative Group, the Six Banks Group,1 Inter-\nministerial Task Force for ODA Management Problem Solving, and the Aid Effectiveness Forum, \nthe Government of Viet Nam requested that ADB continue to assist in building Viet Nam\u2019s \ncapacity in managing ADB-financed projects in particular and ODA in general. The concept \npaper for this technical assistance (TA) was approved on 10 November 2011. The scope, \nexpected impact, outcome, outputs, and implementation arrangements were discussed and \nfinalized during the TA fact-finding mission conducted on 17 November 2011.2 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.    ODA has been an important catalyst for Viet Nam\u2019s rapid economic development, which \nhas averaged 8% per year since 1997. From the resumption of development partner assistance \nto the country in 1993 until the end of 2010, the total ODA resource commitment amounted to \nover $46.3 billion, of which $29.7 billion has been disbursed. As Viet Nam has acquired middle-\nincome country status in 2010, it is likely that ODA will be less available in the future, although \nin the short and medium term ODA will continue to play an important role. To ensure sustained \neconomic growth, the government will therefore be required to effectively utilize ODA and better \nmanage its public investments.  \n \n3.  As one of Viet Nam\u2019s development partners, ADB has provided assistance since 1993 \nwith  annual  lending  averaging  $200  million\u2013$300  million  up  to  2007.  However,  with  the \nintroduction of less-concessional loans (i.e., ordinary capital resources), particularly since 2007, \nADB\u2019s Viet Nam portfolio has expanded - with an average annual lending volume of $1.4 billion. \nAs of the end of September 2011, the ongoing ADB Viet Nam portfolio comprised 55 loans \ntotaling $6.42 billion, 9 grants totaling $93 million, and 42 TA projects totaling $95.2 million for a \ntotal of $6.61 billion in overall assistance.  \n \n4.  The rapid expansion of the portfolio provided opportunities as well as challenges in \nterms of portfolio performance. Overall, portfolio performance \u2013 as reflected in indicators such \nas disbursements, project start-up compliance, average loan extension, and account turnover \nratio \u2013 has deteriorated since 2004 and improved in 2009, but slid back again in 2010. Currently \nmost projects may take up to 8 months from loan approval to loan effectiveness and another \nyear for approval of the first contract, therefore totaling 2-3 years to establish procedures, recruit \nconsultants, prepare detailed designs, and bid out procurement contracts. The disbursement \nratio for ADB-funded projects in Viet Nam was only 12.3% compared with the ADB-wide figure \nof 20.2%.3  Comparing the portfolio performance of Viet Nam with other countries in the region \ngives a mixed result. The average time from loan approval to effectiveness of Viet Nam\u2019s \nportfolio in 2010 was 8.3 months compared with 6.0 months for the Philippines and 9.4 months \nfor Indonesia. Viet Nam\u2019s disbursement ratio in 2010 (12.3%) was about at   par with that of the \nPhilippines (13.2%) but substantially lower than that of Indonesia (36.8%). Viet Nam\u2019s portfolio \nhad 7.3% of projects at risk compared with 0% in the Philippines and 10% in Indonesia. The \n                                                \n1 Members are ADB, the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the \nKorea Eximbank, the KfW, and the World Bank. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 November 2011. \n3  ADB. 2010. Annual Portfolio Performance Report (draft).   \n ", "2  \nportfolio expansion has been a major challenge, which must be urgently addressed through \nperformance improvements. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s Viet Nam 2010 and 2011 portfolio reviews4  identified key constraints, which \namong others, include:  \n \n(i)  Lack of harmonized procedures on project management\u2014Government and \ndonor procedures for project preparation and implementation and key outputs are \nnot  fully  aligned,  which  cause  additional  workload  for  EAs  and  PMUs  and \nimplementation delays. \n(ii)  Implementation  start-up  delays\u2014projects  face  procedural  and  capacity \nconstraints during its initial phases, resulting in high costs of development and \ndelayed benefits.   \n(iii)  Limited effectiveness of portfolio performance monitoring mechanisms\u2014\ncoordination between government and ADB and enhanced government ownership \nof portfolio performance have improved during the past few years. However more effort \nwill be required to effectively monitor the portfolio performance through increased \ndialogue with Government. \n(iv)  Capacity constraints\u2014Government capacity on project management, particularly at \nthe subnational levels is limited. Previous efforts to build capacity will need to be better \nstructured and aligned with the needs of beneficiaries. \n(v)  Institutionalization  of  results  of  dialogues  on  ODA  effectiveness\u2014\nGovernment and donors have been engaged in previous and ongoing dialogue on \nODA  effectiveness.  However  the  results  need  to  be  further  refined  and \ninstitutionalized. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program, 2007\u201320105 clearly indicates the importance of a \nresults-based approach. In order to reduce transaction costs and improve development impacts, \nADB  interventions  should  improve  project  preparation  and  design  processes,  and \nimplementation  performance. The forthcoming country partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015 will \nbuild on the results achieved, and refine the means and procedures to achieve these objectives. \n \n7.    An ADB TA to enhance ODA absorptive capacity and efficiency6 was implemented from \nOctober 2007 to August 2011 to assist the government in addressing some of the portfolio \nperformance issues. Outcomes included capacity built for some executing agency and project \nmanagement unit (PMU) staff to manage and implement projects, harmonized feasibility study \nguidelines, revised cost norms, improved payment procedures, and use of aligned monitoring \ntools through government\u2013Six Banks dialogue. The TA also supported dialogue on advance \nactions, streamlining the project detailed outline, working group discussions on procurement \nand environmental and social safeguard compliance, and government\u2013development partner \ndialogue on aid effectiveness, particularly in forums such as the semiannual Consultative Group \nmeetings  and  the  Aid  Effectiveness  Forum.  In  addition,  it  produced  the  Handbook  on \nProcessing and Implementation for ADB-Funded Projects in Viet Nam (blue book).7 Lessons \nlearned include: (i) progress in building capacity has been uneven, particularly at the provincial \nand lower levels; (ii) targeting of training investments must be improved to ensure a balance \namong PMUs with disparate levels of capacity and varying degrees of strategic importance; (iii) \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2010.

The government currently has plans to amend various decrees and regulations. which will \nhave  significant  impact  on  ODA  project  management,  particularly  Decree 131/2006  on \nmanaging ODA, the 2005 Procurement Law, and the Public Investment Law.  It is therefore \nimportant that (i) outputs and outcomes of the previous TA will need to be better disseminated \nas knowledge products; (ii) dialogue will continue to provide critical inputs to the revision of key \nlegal documents to facilitate the institutionalization of the outputs of the previous TA; (iii) the \ncapacity  of  EAs  and  PMUs  are  improved  to  effectively  implement  the  new  harmonized \nprocedures; and (iv) the government acquires greater ownership of activities to better monitor \nportfolio performance and ensure aid effectiveness.  \n \n9.  The proposed TA will, therefore, not only build on the results achieved in the previous TA \nto  enhance  ODA  absorptive  capacity  and  efficiency,  but  will  further  institutionalize  and \nmainstream the outcomes of the policy dialogues and develop knowledge products/tools for \nbetter implementation. The timing of the proposed TA is critical as revisions to Decree 131/2006 \nand the 2005 Procurement Law and Public Investment Law are expected to be finalized within \n2012. The next opportunity to revise these important pieces of legislation may not occur until \nafter 2017.  \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome   \n \n10.  The impact of the TA will be effective utilization of ODA resources by the Government of \nViet Nam. The outcome will be improved portfolio performance of ADB-funded projects in \nViet Nam.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The outputs of the TA and the main activities to achieve each output are elaborated \nbelow. \n \n12.  Harmonized procedures on official development assistance project management \nof the government and development partners. Harmonized procedures, to include but not be \nlimited  to  streamlined  project  detailed  outline/concept  note,  advance  actions  prior  to  loan \neffectiveness,  ODA  resource  allocation  and  onlending  mechanisms,  issues  relating  to \nprocurement and safeguard compliance, and collaboration through thematic studies on project \nimplementation  will  facilitate  acceleration  of  project  preparation  and  avoid  delays  during \nimplementation. The legal framework governing ODA projects (to be addressed by the new \nDecree on ODA Management and Utilization, to replace Decree 131, along with related circulars) \nwill be strengthened by incorporating these harmonized procedures. TA consultants will assist in \ndeveloping manuals on harmonized procedures, provide inputs to the revision of Decree 131, \nand strengthen the legal framework governing ODA projects. \n \n13.  Improved  project  start-up  performance  and  institutionalized  advance  actions. \nInclusion of advance actions with specified funding sources, time frame, and responsibilities in \n ", "4  \nthe project detailed outline and subsequent implementation of advance actions will be crucial to \nimproved project start-up. These actions include the establishment of functional PMUs with a \nsufficient number of qualified staff; preparation and approval of the project implementation plan, \nprocurement  plan,  and  resettlement  plan;  preparation  and  recruitment  of  the  project \nmanagement  consultants;  preparation  and  approval  of  detailed  designs  for  works  to  be \nimplemented in the first year of project implementation; and prequalification of bidders. TA \nconsultants will assist in developing guidelines on procedures for implementing advance actions, \nstreamlining project detailed outlines and start-up procedures, and updating the blue book. In \nparallel, the TA will benefit from other ADB initiatives such as the project preparation and start-\nup support facility loan, which will be processed for ADB approval in the second quarter of 2012.  \n \n14.  Strengthened institutional mechanism for joint portfolio management. The capacity \nof  the  government  (particularly  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  [MPI])  to  monitor \nportfolio  performance  will  be  enhanced  through  improved  institutional  capacity  to  conduct \nportfolio reviews, and improved coordination between ADB and the MPI, with participation from \nconcerned line agencies, during periodical portfolio performance monitoring exercises such as \nquarterly, midterm, and annual portfolio performance review meetings. The TA will conduct joint \nportfolio  performance  reviews  with  the  Six  Banks  and  collaborate  in  areas  to  strengthen \ninstitutional mechanisms to improve portfolio performance. TA consultants will help compile and \nanalyze portfolio data and provide assistance to the MPI in preparing required reports on \nportfolio performance, issues, and recommendations; and ensure that portfolio performance will \naim at helping achieve the relevant government development targets as well those as in ADB\u2019s \ncorporate results framework.   \n \n15.  Improved capacity for project management and supervision. Building the capacity of \nexecuting agencies and PMUs of ADB-funded projects at the central and local levels\u2014through \ntraining  programs,  dissemination  of  information,  and  participatory  activities\u2014will  enable \ngovernment staff to manage the project cycle in a better manner. Capacity building activities will \ninclude, but not be limited to, development of needed project management skills, setup for \nproject monitoring and evaluation, and reporting skills. As existing programs are fragmented, \nthese will need to be better linked and structured, with emphasis on government ownership. Key \ngovernment agencies (the MPI, Ministry of Finance, and State Bank of Vietnam) will play an \nimportant  role  in  implementing  the  training  programs.  TA  consultants  will  conduct  an \nassessment of existing training programs and the training needs of executing agencies and \nPMUs, recommend structured training, and develop tool kits for capacity building and project \nmanagement.  \n \n16.  Institutionalization of outcomes of dialogues on official development assistance \neffectiveness in Viet Nam. Dialogue between the government and development partners on \nODA effectiveness is ongoing and will continue through various forums such as the Consultative \nGroup meetings, Aid Effectiveness Forum, and the Inter-ministerial Task Force meetings with \nthe Six Banks, with inputs from various thematic studies. The government highly appreciates \nthese efforts and utilizes the outputs to provide inputs to its laws, decrees, circulars, and \ndecisions. The discussions will require consultative and dissemination workshops as well as \nother venues for interaction and exchange of ideas. TA consultants will assist the government to \nfacilitate these activities  and the participation of civil society organization in the policy dialogue \nand  consultations,  and  assist  government  in  preparing  reports  and  issues  papers  on  the \ndialogue process. \n \n   \n ", "5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff remuneration and office spaces. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The MPI will be the executing agency. A PMU will be set up under the Foreign Economic \nRelations Department of the MPI to manage day-to-day activities of the TA. The TA team will \nwork  closely  with  the  Inter-ministerial  Task  Force  for  ODA  Management  to  ensure  the \ninvolvement of other government agencies/ministries in the implementation of the TA. \n \n19.     The  TA  will  require  43  person-months  of  consulting  services  (8  person-months \ninternational  and  35  person-months  national)  in  the  areas  of  institutional  development \n(5 person-months  international  and  20  person-months  national),  portfolio  management \n(3 person-months international and 10 person-months national), economics (4 person-months \nnational), and capacity building (1 person-month national). The consultants will be recruited \nindividually by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). The outline terms of references of the consultants are in Appendix \n3. Office equipment for a total maximum amount of $10,000 will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). These equipment will be \nhanded over to the Executing Agency upon completion of the TA. Disbursements under the TA \nwill be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The executing agency will administer costs for trainings and \nworkshops. An advance payment facility shall be used to receive deposits by ADB. \n \n20.    As some activities under the outputs (i), (ii), and (iii) will be implemented under the \nframework  of  the  Six  Banks  initiatives,  other  banks  -  including  the  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the Korea Eximbank, the KfW, \nand the World Bank - will contribute technical inputs in the form of comments to the draft \nreports/papers prepared under these outputs.  \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented from 15 December 2011 to 30 November 2014. The TA\u2019s \nexpected outcomes will be jointly monitored and evaluated by the MPI and ADB during TA \ninception, midterm, and final review missions, and TA progress will be made on a quarterly \nbasis and discussed semiannually with MPI and relevant government ministries. Baseline data \non portfolio performance such as contract awards, disbursements, start-up compliance, and \nnumber of projects at risk will be continuously monitored during the course of the TA.  \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  for  Support  to  Improve  Portfolio  Performance  and  Aid \nEffectiveness, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  \nAppendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and   \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nEffective utilization of  ODA disbursement ratio, a  Aid Effectiveness Forum  Government support for \nODA resources by  currently 20%, on par with  Reports  framework to harmonize its \nGovernment of  international average by    procedures with ODA \nViet Nam  2018  Government statistics on   procedures \n    the MPI website   \nStart-up b time currently 8    Risk \nmonths, on a par with    Rapid changes in the \ninternational average by  development context in \n2018  Viet Nam affect the \n  expected impacts of ODA \nCompletion of ODA-funded  projects in Viet Nam  \nprojects, currently 8 years,   \non a par with international \naverage by 2018 \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved performance  Increased cumulative  ADB quarterly country  More dedicated capacity \nof ADB-funded projects  disbursement ratio from  portfolio performance  building support to line \nin Viet Nam  20% to 30% by 2014  review   agencies in need \n       \nReduced time elapsed:  COSO country portfolio  Proposals on harmonized \n(i) loan approval to  review data and SERD  procedures for project \neffectiveness from 8 months  Operations Dashboard  preparation and start-up \n(2010) to 6 months (2014);    will be institutionalized in \n(ii) loan approval to first    the Vietnamese legal \ncontract from 16 months    framework for ODA \n(2010) to 11 months (2014)    management \n     \nReduced loan extensions to  COSO country portfolio \n10% of ongoing portfolio by  review data and SERD \n2014  Operations Dashboard \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
