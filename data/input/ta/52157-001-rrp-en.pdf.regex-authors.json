I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $350,000,000, comprising (i) a senior unsecured A loan of up to $150,000,000, and (ii) a B \nloan of up to $200,000,000 to be distributed among commercial lenders, to Far East Horizon \nLimited (FEH) for Health Care Finance in Underdeveloped Provinces in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC). \n \n2.  The project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing longer-tenor financing \nto FEH for lease finance offered through its wholly-owned subsidiary, International Far Eastern \nLeasing Co., Ltd. (IFEL),1 to public hospitals in the 12 least-developed provinces of the PRC.2 \nThe A loan proceeds will be used exclusively to provide financing to county hospitals, which \nprimarily serve the local rural population.3 ADB\u2019s financing will meet FEH\u2019s funding requirements \nfor  longer-term  funding  and  enable  the  company  to  provide  longer-tenor  lease  finance  to \nunderserved segments. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Economic overview. Despite rapid economic growth since the 1980s, regional disparity \nand income inequality remain major issues in the PRC. Economic development in the central and \nwestern  regions  lags  significantly  behind  the  coastal  region,  where  most  export-oriented \nindustries are located. The 12 least-developed provinces, all in the central and western regions, \nhad per capita annual disposable incomes of CNY15,457\u2013CNY20,635, more than 20% below the \nnational average of CNY25,974 in 2017. There is also substantial income disparity between the \nurban and rural populations. In 2017, the average disposable income of a rural resident was \nCNY13,432, only 36.9% of an urban resident\u2019s average income level (footnote 2). \n \n4.  Health sector. Rapid economic development since 1980 has been accompanied by a \nsignificant  rise  in  health  care  expenditure  in  the  PRC.  However,  the  PRC\u2019s  health  care \nexpenditure lags behind global averages; it was equivalent to 5.3% of gross domestic product \n(GDP) in 2015, well below the global average of 9.9%.4 On a per capita basis, it was $425.6 in \n2015, compared with the global average of $1,001.7.5 Since 2000, the PRC has made significant \n                                                \n1  Organizational Chart (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). IFEL conducts all FEH leasing \ntransactions in the PRC. Including two other FEH subsidiaries\u2014Far East Horizon (Tianjin) Financial Leasing Co., \nLtd. and Far East Horizon Leasing Co., Ltd.\u2014IFEL\u2019s total consolidated assets accounted for about 97% of FEH as \nof 31 December 2017. ADB\u2019s loan agreement will be with FEH, which is based in Hong Kong, China, because FEH \nis the funding platform for all foreign currency borrowings. \n2  The 12 least-developed provinces had the lowest per capita income among the 31 provinces in the PRC in 2017 as \nper the National Bureau of Statistics (Government of the PRC, National Bureau of Statistics. Resident Disposable \nIncome Database. http://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=C01 [accessed 4 July 2018]). \n3  County hospitals refer to hospitals in regions at county level or below. The PRC has five administrative levels: \nprovince, prefecture, county, township, and village (Government of the PRC, Ministry of Civil Affairs. List of \nAdministrative Regions. http://www.mca.gov.cn/article/sj/tjbz/a/2018/201803131439.html [accessed 4 July 2018]). \nPrefecture (also called \u201ccity\u201d in the PRC) refers to the area governed by a prefectural government, which typically \ncomprises urban districts and counties. County refers to the area governed by a county government, which typically \ncomprises townships and villages. Low-tier cities refers to prefectures that are not provincial capitals, except counties \nor county-level cities within the boundary of a provincial capital. \n4  World Bank. DataBank.

Current Health Expenditure Per Capita (current $). \nhttps://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD (accessed 2 August 2018). \n ", "2 \nprogress in developing its national medical insurance system. By the end of 2016, basic medical \ninsurance had more than 1.3 billion beneficiaries nationwide, representing a coverage rate of \nabove 95%. With the Rural Cooperative Medical System now covering more than 95% of the rural \npopulation and reimbursing about 80% of medical expenditures, improvement in access to and \nquality of care provided by local county hospitals is critical for improving rural health care \nstandards. From 2011 to 2015, the PRC invested CNY42 billion in building 1,500 county hospitals, \n18,000 town and township health centers, and more than 100,000 village clinics and community \nhealth centers. However, despite this progress, further investment in health care infrastructure is \nrequired, especially in the rural and underdeveloped regions where there remain wide disparities \nwith urban health care infrastructure and investments. The most recent data show that annual \nhealth care expenditure per capita in 2014 was CNY3,558 in urban areas and CNY1,412 in rural \nareas. As of 2016, the number of beds in medical and health care institutions for every 10,000 \npeople was 84.13 in urban areas and 39.09 in rural areas.6 Moreover, as of 2016, urban areas \nhad 108 health care professionals and 49 registered nurses for every 10,000 people; rural areas \nhad 40 health care professionals and 15 registered nurses. There are also significant disparities \nbetween the eastern, central, and western regions. Health care spending per capita in 2015 was \nCNY4,152 in eastern regions, which was significantly higher than CNY2,550 in central regions \nand CNY2,967 in western regions. \n \n5.  Leasing industry. Hospitals often have difficulties accessing bank finance for equipment \nand infrastructure investments, as banks typically do not accept medical equipment and land \n(which is typically government owned) as collateral. Leasing provides a good solution, whereby \nhospitals can directly lease medical equipment or use sale and lease-back of existing equipment \nto secure finance for additional investment. The PRC\u2019s leasing industry has been growing rapidly, \ntargeting this financing gap that traditional bank financing does not address. As of the end of \nDecember 2017, 9,090 financial leasing companies (FLCs) had been registered in the PRC. \nDespite  rapid  growth  since  2008,  the  PRC\u2019s  financial  leasing  industry  still  needs  further \ndevelopment. Lease market penetration, measured as the ratio of lease finance over all fixed \ninvestments in plant and equipment, in 2016 was only 6.0%, compared with 21.5% in the United \nStates, 33.7% in the United Kingdom, and high single-digit rates in developed Asian countries \nsuch as Japan and the Republic of Korea. The lease penetration rate, measured as a percentage \nof lease finance to total GDP, was 1.8% in the PRC in 2016, ranking it 17th among 50 countries.7 \nIn the PRC, FLCs were previously approved and supervised by the China Banking and Insurance \nRegulatory Commission (CBIRC) or by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC). On 20 April 2018, the \nMOC  transferred  the  authority  for  formulating  regulations  governing  the  operations  and \nsupervision of FLCs to the CBIRC. Details of a new regulatory regime for FLCs previously \nsupervised by the MOC have yet to be released. \n \n6.  Rationale. ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations projects in the PRC\u2019s finance sector have \nactively supported leasing, targeting diverse subsectors focusing on underdeveloped segments, \nincluding health care.8 The $75 million ADB loan disbursed to State Grid International Leasing \n(renamed from Yingda International Leasing after major change of shareholder structure) in 2017 \n                                                \n6  Government  of  the  PRC,  National  Bureau  of  Statistics.

The strong demand for lease finance \nfrom  hospitals  in  underdeveloped  regions  as  demonstrated  by  the  earlier  project  supports \nadditional ADB funding in this sector and on a more focused basis. FEH, with more than 20 years \nof health care leasing and an existing relationship with ADB,9 was identified as a good partner. \nFEH operations have a strong development focus, and 55% of its health care lease portfolio is in \nthe underdeveloped central and western regions of the PRC. Health care lease exposure in the \n12 least-developed provinces totaled CNY10.6 billion as of year-end 2017 (28% of its total health \ncare leasing portfolio), of which more than 67% were county-level hospital clients.  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n7.  FEH, one of the PRC\u2019s leading financial services groups, provides financial leasing and \nextended value-added services. With total assets of CNY272.3 billion as of 30 June 2018, it is the \nsecond-largest FLC in the PRC by assets. FEH started operations in 1991 and was listed on the \nHong Kong Stock Exchange in 2011. FEH is rated as BBB\u2013 by Standard and Poor\u2019s and Fitch \nRatings. FEH offers integrated financial services, including financial and operating leases10 and \nadvisory services, and has gradually scaled up investments in and management of hospitals and \nschools since 2014. FEH operates in health care, education, infrastructure construction, industrial \nmachinery,  electronic  information,  urban  public  utilities,  and  packaging  and  transportation. \nFinancial  leasing,  conducted  through  IFEL,  is  the  core  activity  of  FEH\u2019s  businesses. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n8.  In addition to financial leasing, FEH offers advisory services for technology upgrades, \nfinancial  management,  hospital  rating  consultancy  services,  equipment  operations,  and \nengineering. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n9.  Ownership. FEH is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Its largest shareholder is \nGreatpart Limited (wholly owned by Sinochem Group Co., Ltd) with a 23.27% ownership stake. \nEstablished in 1950, Sinochem is fully owned by the Government of the PRC and is a Fortune \n500 company with operations in oil, chemicals, and agriculture. Its assets totaled CNY417.2 billion \nat the end of 2017. The second-largest shareholder is Cathay Life Insurance Co., Ltd. with a \n7.49% ownership stake. Cathay Life Insurance is the largest insurance company in Taipei,China. \nThe  operating  subsidiary,  IFEL  is  wholly-owned  by  FEH.

Under the loan program, $100 million was disbursed \nto FEH in two tranches in 2013 and 2014. FEH, in turn, provided shareholder loans to IFEL. As of 26 March 2018, \nADB had net exposure of $35 million (accounting for risk transfers). The company has been performing well and the \nextended annual review gave the program an overall rating of successful. (ADB. 2016. Extended Annual Review \nReport: Senior Loan for Clean Bus Leasing in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila.). \n10 In a financial lease agreement, ownership of the property is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term. \nWith operating leases, ownership of the property is retained during and after the lease term by the lessor. \n ", "4 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n10.  ADB will provide a senior unsecured A loan of up to $150 million with a tenor of up to 7 \nyears. ADB expects to syndicate a B loan of up to $200 million among commercial banks and \nother eligible B loan participants. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n11.  FEH, through its financial leasing subsidiary IFEL, will use the proceeds of the ADB loan \nto  finance  the  lease  or  purchase  of  modern  medical  equipment  and  hospital  fixed-asset \ninvestments (e.g., construction, expansion, or refurbishment of hospital buildings or associated \nmedical facilities) through sale and leaseback transactions.11 Eligible hospital facilities will be \nlocated in the 12 least-developed provinces with the lowest per capita disposable incomes among \nthe 31 provinces of the PRC. These 12 provinces are located in the central and western regions \nof the PRC where economic development and health care standards lag behind those in the \ncoastal regions. The hospitals financed by the loans will be in counties or low-tier cities in the \ntarget provinces.12 The A loan will be used exclusively for county hospitals, which primarily serve \nthe population in surrounding rural areas. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n12.  Providing  critically  needed  long-term  finance.  As  noted, majority  of  FEH\u2019s  bank \nborrowings are short term. For long-term finance, the company issues bonds, which are capped \nby  the  annual foreign bond  issuance quota granted  by  the  Government  of  the  PRC,  and \nregistration with the government is required for each issuance. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \nDELETED. \n \n13.  Enhancing Far East Horizon\u2019s environmental and social safeguard capacity. As a \ncondition precedent for disbursement, FEH will be required to establish an ESMS that meets the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). ADB will continue to work with FEH \nthroughout the period of ADB investment to enhance the safeguard capacity of the company and \nsupport the company\u2019s adherence to high safeguard standards. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \nDELETED. \n \n14.  Catalyzing  private  sector  funding  and  support.  ADB  is  expected  to  mobilize  a \nsubstantial  amount  of  private  sector  funding  for  this  project  under  a  B  loan  structure. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n                                                \n11 Under a sale and leaseback transaction, the hospital sells its existing medical equipment to IFEL and obtains \nfinancing in the form of sale proceeds. At the same time, it signs a financial lease contract with IFEL to lease the \nequipment back. The hospital may use the new financing from IFEL to invest in fixed assets. Financial lease contracts \nsigned within 9 months before the signing date of the ADB loan are eligible for financing provided that they meet \neligibility criteria and ADB\u2019s safeguards requirement. This provision allows IFEL to develop the subproject pipeline \nwhile the ADB loan is being processed to expedite disbursement. \n12 The proposed loan will not finance any hospital in a provincial capital city itself, however it may finance hospitals in \ncounties or county-level cities governed by the provincial capital. \n ", "5 \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n15.  Impacts. The proposed project is expected to have the following strong development \nimpacts: \n(i)  Medical and health service system in least-developed provinces improved. \nThe project will improve the facilities of public hospitals in the least-developed \nprovinces, thus reducing the regional disparity in health care standards, widening \naccess to quality health care, and allowing benefits from economic development \nto be more equally shared by the population. With the Rural Cooperative Medical \nSystem now in effect, improvement of local county hospitals is needed to improve \nrural health care standards. By reducing the need for long-distance travel to city \nhospitals, the improvement of county hospital facilities will directly benefit the \nmajority of the rural population in the local area, which is significantly underserved \nby the health care system where average health care expenditure is only 40% of \nthe level in urban areas. \n(ii)  Financial leasing industry developed. By providing longer-tenor finance to a \nmajor FLC and introducing best practice in safeguards, the project will support the \ndevelopment of the financial leasing industry. The financial leasing sector can \nprovide  innovative  solutions  to  address  markets  that  that  are  unserved  or \nunderserved by banks. Despite rapid growth since 2009, the PRC\u2019s financial \nleasing industry is still underdeveloped, with a leasing penetration rate that is \nbelow that in other developed markets.  \n \n16.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be the enhanced sustainability of FEH\u2019s health care \nleasing operations in the least-developed provinces of the PRC. \n \n17.  Outputs. The project will have the following outputs: \n(i)  Far East Horizon's health care leasing operations in the least-developed \nprovinces expanded. FEH, through IFEL, will disburse $350 million of finance \nleases  funded  by  the  ADB  loan  for  hospital  investments  and  health  care \nimprovements in the 12 PRC provinces with the lowest average personal income \nlevels. \n(ii)  Facilities and diagnostic and treatment capacity of hospitals in counties and \nlow-tier cities improved. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n(iii)  Far  East  Horizon's  gender  inclusiveness  improved.  CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n18.  Consistency with  ADB  strategy and country strategy. The project supports four \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities: addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, \npromoting rural development, strengthening governance and institutional capacity through ADB\u2019s \nESMS, and accelerating progress in gender equality.13 Under Strategy 2030, ADB will increase \nits emphasis on human development and social inclusion and expand its support for education, \nhealth care, and social protection programs. By financing hospitals in counties and low-tier cities \nin the least-developed provinces, the project will help address inequality in health care access \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2018.

By promoting private sector finance for public health care investment, \nADB will help develop a suitable solution for public health care finance in an upper middle-income \ncountry. The project has a substantial cofinancing component, which helps meet one of ADB\u2019s \ntargets for nonsovereign operations in Strategy 2030. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC, which emphasizes inclusive and sustainable growth \nand targeted interventions in the finance sector.14 \n \n19.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is in line \nwith ADB\u2019s operational plan for health, which supports universal health coverage and identifies \ninvesting in health infrastructure and financing health service delivery as key priorities.15 Finance \nsector development is also a key focus of development assistance for ADB. As noted in para. 6, \nthe project builds on previous ADB support for the PRC\u2019s leasing industry and health sector. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n20.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009).16 \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n21.  FEH was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \nC.  Assurances \n \n22.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),17 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of the \nPRC has no objection to the proposed assistance to FEH. ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n   \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2016.
