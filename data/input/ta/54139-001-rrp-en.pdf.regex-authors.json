THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe Republic of Indonesia for the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program \n(CARES program) under the countercyclical support facility COVID-19 pandemic response option \n(CPRO).1  \n \n2.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had a devastating health, social, and \neconomic impact on Indonesia. As of 15 April 2020, there were 5,136 confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19 in Indonesia and 469 deaths. Indonesia is highly vulnerable to pandemics, and has \nthe highest COVID-19 related fatality rate of any country in Southeast Asia.2 Public health \nmeasures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have seriously disrupted economic activity, and \nthe Government projects 2020 to produce the lowest economic growth level in 21 years (2.3%), \ndown  from  an  original  estimate  of  5.2%.  Other  institutions  have  also  revised  their  growth \nexpectations downwards, with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) projecting a 2020 growth rate \nof 2.5%, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting 0.5%.3 Each of these outlooks has \nrisks tilted towards the downside.   \n \n3.  The crisis is also having a significant impact on livelihoods, especially within the most \nvulnerable communities.  Close to ten million people are at risk of falling below the national poverty \nline, with poverty incidence expected to increase from 9.4% in March 2019 to between 11.9%-\n12.8% in 2020. The Government estimates that 5.2 million Indonesians will lose their jobs due to \nthe COVID-19 induced economic slowdown.  \n \n4.  These shocks severely impact the government\u2019s fiscal position and give rise to urgent and \nlarge near-term financing needs.  The economic slowdown is expected to produce a 20% shortfall \nin revenue relative to projections for 2020, with the reduction concentrated in the second quarter \nof 2020. At the same time, the government must undertake significant fiscal actions in response \nto the crisis and has announced a $32.4 billion package for urgently needed health, social \nassistance, and economic support measures. The additional gross financing requirement for 2020 \nis estimated at $39.8 billion.  \n \n5.  Official financing is of heightened importance in this context.  Global uncertainty has \nunnerved financial markets resulting in sudden capital flight, depreciation of the rupiah to levels \nunseen since the 1998 Asian financial crisis, and a sharp increase in bond yields.  Liquidity \nconditions are also deteriorating in domestic credit markets, and borrowing costs are rising. There \nis a heightened risk that government debt issuance could crowd out potential financing for an \neven more liquidity constrained private sector.  \n \n6.  The proposed CARES program is critical. The CARES program will provide timely \nsupport  for  urgent  public  health  measures  and  for  the  expansion  of  social  and  economic \nassistance. It builds on ADB\u2019s trusted relationship with the Government of Indonesia through long-\nstanding engagement. Indonesia meets all of the access criteria of ADB\u2019s COVID-19 Pandemic \nResponse Option (CPRO) under the Countercyclical Support Facility (CSF), which include robust \n \n1  ADB. 2020.

Compliance with Access Criteria for CPRO \nCPRO Access Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1. Adverse impact of  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government projects 2020 to produce \nexogenous shocks   the lowest economic growth level in 21 years at 2.3%, down from an original \nestimate of 5.2%, with employment loss projected at as many as 7 million. \nGross financing requirements have substantially increased due to falling \npublic revenue and increased expenditure, resulting in a widening fiscal \ndeficit.  Unfavorable  liquidity  conditions  and  rising  costs  pose  a  severe \nchallenge to meeting additional financing needs.  \n2. Countercyclical  The government has announced a pro-poor countercyclical expenditure \ndevelopment  program of $32.4 billion to support public health, social assistance, and \nexpenditure  economic measures towards mitigating the adverse impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic. About 20.2% of the package, $6.5 billion, will be in the form of \nsocial assistance programs for poor and vulnerable households. \n3. Pre-shock record of  Prior  to the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy expanded by 5.0%  on \nsound macroeconomic  average during 2015\u20132019. Inflation has been carefully managed and was \nmanagement  only 2.8% in 2019. The tax-to-GDP ratio averaged 10.2% over 2015-2019. \nThe fiscal deficit averaged only 2.3% between 2015-2019. \n4. Structural reforms  Indonesia is taking credible steps to address the spread of COVID-19 and \nmitigate its economic impacts on the population (Tables 3 and 4). To address \nthe  health  crisis,  in  line  with  the  World  Health  Organization\u2019s \nrecommendation,  the  government  emphasizes  clinical  management \nparticularly of severe and critical cases, infection prevention and control \namong health workers and the general population. It announced a $4.5 billion \nhealth response package. As presented in Table 4, besides support for the \nhealth  sector,  the  government\u2019s  response  consists  of  3  packages  with \nsupport covering social assistance, small business recovery program, and \ntax relief for manufacturing workers. The government established a COVID-\n19 task force chaired by the head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency \nwith senior representatives from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of State-\nOwned Enterprises, Indonesian Military, and the National Police.   \n5. Debt sustainability  Central government debt increased marginally from 26.2% of GDP to 29.8% \nof  GDP  between  2010\u20132019  as  investment  in  public  infrastructure \naccelerated. Additional borrowing under the CPRO has minimal (0.2%) \nimpact on debt\u2013GDP ratio.  \n6. Coordination with  ADB  is  in  close  contact  with  the  IMF  on  macroeconomic  monitoring, \nInternational Monetary  particularly on the impact of COVID-19 and fiscal responses.

PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n7.  The world is grappling with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a \nrecently discovered infectious disease, and from the same family of viruses that triggered the \n \n4  Details on compliance with the access criteria are in Appendix 4.  \n ", "3 \nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory \nsyndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2012. Its outbreak was initially identified in Wuhan, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, and the first official death was recorded on 9 January 2020. By 30 January \n2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health \nemergency of global concern, and later declared it a pandemic.5 COVID-19 has now spread to \n185 countries, areas and territories. Globally, the preliminary estimated death rate is between \n3%\u20134%, although there continue to be significant data limitations.  Death rates are higher for older \npeople and for those with underlying health conditions.6 As of 15 April 2020, over 2 million people \nwere recorded as infected, with more than 134,000 deaths reported globally.7 In contrast, SARS \nresulted in 813 deaths and MERS in 858 deaths globally.8 \n \n8.  Global commerce is grinding to a halt. Countries are now learning that flattening the \npandemic curve inevitably steepens the macroeconomic recession curve.9 Low income countries \nface particular challenges due to severe deficiencies in health services. Many countries have \nrestricted citizens\u2019 mobility and are requesting people to stay home in order to contain the spread  \nof the virus and prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems. As a result, economic activity \nhas been seriously curtailed, with factories suspending production and retail trade restricted to \nessential services. The ultimate health and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 will depend on \nhow the spread of the disease continues to evolve; the effectiveness of public health care systems \nand  policies;  communities\u2019  behavioral  responses;  and  national,  regional,  and  global \nmacroeconomic and fiscal responses. As of 3 April 2020, ADB estimated the impact of the \npandemic on global gross domestic product (GDP) to be in the range of -2.3% to -4.8%. On  \n14 April 2020, the IMF released economic growth projections of -0.6% for ASEAN-5, on the \nassumption that the United States (US) and eurozone economies would contract by -5.9% and -\n7.9% respectively.10  \n \nFigure 1: National COVID-19 Trends in Indonesia \n500\n6000\n400\n5000\n4000 300\n3000 200\n2000\n100\n1000\n0\n0 ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra rp rp rp rp rp rp rp\nraM 5raM 7raM 9raM 1raM 3raM 5raM 7raM 9raM 1rpA 2rpA 4rpA 6rpA 8rpA 0rpA 2rpA 4 M 51 M 71 M 91 M 12 M 32 M 52 M 92 M 13 A 2 A 4 A 6 A 8 A 01 A 21 A 41\n111222223 111\nTotal Number of Patients Recovered\nCumulative Cases (since 100th case) Total Number of Deaths\n \nSource: https://www.covid19.go.id/situasi-virus-corona/   \n \n5  WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020. https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-\ngeneral-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020 (accessed on 3 April 2020). \n6  WHO. 2020.

World Economic \nOutlook, April 2020 - The Great Lockdown. Washington, DC. \n ", "4 \n9.  COVID-19 cases and deaths are rapidly increasing in Indonesia, leaving many \nhouseholds highly vulnerable to health and income shocks. As of 15 April 2020, Indonesia \nhad 5,136 positive cases and 469 deaths (Figure 1). Three regions\u2014Jakarta, Bali, and Banten\u2014\nwere hit particularly hard. There is concern that these figures may not show the complete picture, \ndue to many undetected cases arising from the low number of tests carried out to date, and some \nmodels suggest that the true number of positive cases could be between 70,000 and 250,000.11 \nAs the number of cases has grown, so has the number of deaths; Indonesia\u2019s fatality rate of \napproximately 8% is one of the highest in the world. Given Indonesia\u2019s weak health care system \nand institutions, the Citibank Pandemic Vulnerability Index shows Indonesia as the third most \nvulnerable to pandemics in Asia. Poor and vulnerable households could face increased food \ninsecurity due to loss of income as well as food shortages. Even prior to the outbreak, 19.4 million \npeople were unable to meet their dietary requirements, with 37.2% of children under the age of 5 \nexperiencing stunting, which will be further worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.12  \n \n10.  The COVID-19 pandemic is further straining an already overburdened health care \nsystem. The pandemic will put increasing pressure on Indonesia\u2019s health system, which already \nlags behind its regional peers in terms of main health indicators. For example, Indonesia has only \n3.7 doctors per 10,000 people (the Republic of Korea has six times more); and only 10 hospital \nbeds per 10,000 people and 2.7 critical care beds per 100,000 people, which is among the lowest \nin the region.13 Table 2 shows a comparative analysis of various Southeast Asian countries on \nkey indicators.14 The rapidly increasing burden on Indonesia\u2019s health care system from the spread \nof COVID-19 will impede: (i) surveillance and diagnosis, including testing; (ii) health service \ndelivery in terms of both equipment and personnel; (iii) infection prevention and control; and (iv) \nhealth financing protection. Indonesia\u2019s health workers are overburdened (approximately 26 \nmedical doctors and nine nurses have passed away due to COVID-19 infection or exhaustion)15 \nand are under intense strain due to limited personal protective equipment. Even before COVID-\n19, the health insurance system was suffering from constant deficits, resulting in underfunded \nfacilities. Moreover, as the focus and fiscal support are being diverted to address COVID-19, \npatients are less likely to be able to access routine health services and receive medical care for \nacute and chronic conditions. This will result in devastating outcomes for the population at large, \nnot just for those infected by COVID-19.16  \nTable 2: Summary Comparison of COVID-19 Related Data and Effects  \nNo. of  Tests processed  GDP  Poverty \nCritical  Announced \ncases  per 1 million  forecasta Job  estimates \ncare  stimulus \nCountry  (as of  population   / fiscal  losses  (pre-/post-\nbeds/  package  \n15 April  (as of   deficit  (million)  COVID-19; \n100,000  ($ billion) \n2020)  15 April 2020)  (%)  (%) \nIndonesia  5,136      132      2.7  0.5/-5.1  7  9.4/11.9\u201312.8  32.4 \nMalaysia  5,072   2,694      3.4  -2.0/-4.7  2.4  0.4/NA  60.3 \nPhilippines  5,453      415      2.2  -1.0/-5.3  4.3  16.6/20.7  12.1 \nSingapore  3,699   12,423   11.4  -4.0/-8.9  0.15\u20130.2  NA  43.7 \nThailand  2,643     1,440   10.4  -5.3/-7.0  1.8\u20133.1  10.0/18.0  73.2 \nViet Nam     267     1,397   NA  4.8/-5.1  1.3  5.8/NA  10.8 \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GDP = gross domestic product, NA = data not available. \n \n11 https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/current-patterns-transmission/cases-from-deaths.html  \n12 https://www.wfp.org/countries/indonesia  \n13 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Data. 2019.

The pandemic is causing a sharp fall in domestic output. Indonesian manufacturing \nfirms  reported  a  steep  downturn  in  March  2020,  with  production  and  new  orders  sharply \ncontracting. As global public health measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have ramped \nup, tourist arrivals have come to an abrupt halt, and domestic industry and service activities have \ndecelerated.  Simulation  results  using  Indonesia\u2019s  computable  general  equilibrium  model \n(IndoTERM) indicate that a 1-month-long national disruption could result in a drop in the output \nof hotels by 11.54% and of restaurants by 7.86% in 2020 (Figure 3a).17 Transport, construction, \nfood processing, and other manufacturing outputs would also suffer serious impacts. The most \nseverely affected regions of Banten, Jakarta, and Bali are expected to sustain a sharp deviation \nfrom their baseline growth in 2020 (Figure 3b). The government projects that economic growth in \n2020  will  see  a  very  steep  decline,  from  the  pre-COVID-19  projection  of  5.2%  to  2.3%. \nFurthermore, business shutdowns have already resulted in job losses and declines in consumer \nsentiment, particularly in urban areas. Household budgets are likely to come under stress from \njob losses and increased health care spending, with discretionary expenditures expected to \nshrink. \n \nFigure 3a: Top 5 Most Affected Sectors   Figure 3b: Regions Most Severely Affected \n(% reduction in sector output in 2020)     (% deviation from baseline growth in 2020) \nRestaurants -7.86 Bali -5.73\nHotels -11.54 East Java -4.17\nTransport -5.67 Yogyakarta -4.12\nConstruction -3.07 Central Java -4.10\nOther manufacturing -1.37 Banten -5.74\nFood Processing -2.87 West Java -5.03\nJakarta -5.51\n-15.00 -10.00 -5.00 0.00\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n12.  Economic slowdown threatens gains made in job creation. As measures to mitigate \nthe health impacts of COVID-19 are implemented, the labor market has been affected. It is \nestimated that job losses due to shutdown of the economy could be in the range of 1 million to  \n7 million under ADB\u2019s current best-case and worst-case scenarios for the impact of COVID-19 on \nIndonesia\u2019s economy. As of 11 April 2020, the Ministry of Manpower reported that 1.5 million \nworkers had already been put on unpaid leave or laid off. It is estimated that this will result in the \nunemployment rate almost doubling from 5.3% in 2019 to 10.5% in 2020. Wage income losses \nwill be influenced by the effectiveness of measures to protect the 33 million male and 18 million \nfemale employees (40% of total employment) in the formal economy. The 71 million self-\nemployed, casual employees, and unpaid workers who are not covered by employment protection \nlegislation\u2014accounting for approximately 53% of total employment\u2014will have very limited options \n \n17 A.

IndoTERM is a bottom \nup multiregional computable general equilibrium model. The model was developed through a collaborative effort from \nIndonesia\u2019s National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS); Center for Economics and Development Studies \n(CEDS), Universitas Padjadjaran, Indonesia; Center of Policy Studies (CoPS), Monash University, Australia; and, \nADB.

One in five men and one in three women work in the wholesale or retail trade and in \naccommodation and food services, and many of these jobs are informal. Occupations in these \nsectors, as well as in construction, agriculture, manufacturing, and transport, are less amenable \nto work-from-home arrangements and exposed to downturns in business volumes. Temporary \nemployees and casual workers are usually the first to be laid off as business slows.  \n \n13.  Income losses will result in higher poverty rates. It is estimated that the national \npoverty rate may increase from a baseline of 9.4% in March 2019 to 11.9%\u201312.8% in 2020.18 \nWhile the severity in the hike of poverty may vary by province, those provinces that have economic \nactivities with strong links to commodity trade, tourism, and manufacturing are likely to be hit \nhardest. \n \n14.  The health and economic shocks are cascading into the financial and external \nsectors. Indonesia is experiencing a sudden capital outflow due to a change in global risk \nsentiment resulting in investors\u2019 exiting emerging markets. From January to April 2020, cumulative \nportfolio outflow stood at $9.6 billion, compared to inflow of $5.7 billion during the same period in \n2019 (Figure 4a). These reversals increased bond yields by nearly 200 basis points and the rupiah \ndepreciated by approximately 20% to Rp16,741 against the US dollar\u2014to levels last seen during \nthe Asian financial crisis in 1998 (Figure 4b). To mitigate the market volatility caused by the capital \noutflows, the central bank bought $10.8 billion in local and foreign currency government bonds \nfrom the secondary market, of which $10.4 billion was from foreign investors, leading to a \nreduction in international reserves of 6.8% to $121.0 billion. Key trading partners of Indonesia are \nfacing sudden economic shutdowns because of the staggered global outbreak of COVID-19 \naffecting demand for Indonesia\u2019s exports. The continuing slump in oil and commodity prices due \nto the global economic slowdown will reduce Indonesia\u2019s export earnings, while travel disruptions \nwill translate into lower tourism and transport receipts. Disruptions to trade flow and weak \ndomestic demand will lower overall imports. Seasonal dividend repatriations in primary income \nwill contribute to higher current account deficit in the near term. The current account deficit has \nbeen historically financed by net portfolio inflows, while the ongoing uncertainty has triggered a \nmass outflow of portfolio investment.  \n \nFigure 4a: Cumulative Portfolio Flow ($ billion)   Figure 4b: Foreign Exchange Rate (Rp/$) \n8\n4\n0 -0.8\n-4\nEquity -8.6\nDebt\n-8 Total - 2019\n-9.4\nTotal\n-12\nJan-2020 Feb-2020 Mar-2020 Apr-2020\n \nSource: Bank Indonesia; https://prospera.or.id.    \n \n15.  Gross financing needs will increase due to the countercyclical measures.

Continued lower commodity prices will affect export earnings. Public \nexpenditure is projected to increase to $149.4 billion from $145.2 billion, in part due to unplanned \nexpenditures related to COVID-19 response. The government has deferred $10.4 billion in \nplanned capital spending, and reallocated $3.1 billion within certain sectors due to COVID-19 \nrelated requirements. In 2020, the fiscal deficit is expected to increase to $48.7 billion (5.1% of \nGDP) from $17.6 billion (1.8% of GDP), and the gross financing needs are expected to almost \ndouble from $42.4 billion to $82.2 billion.  \n \n16.  The Government of Indonesia has responded well to meet the initial public health \nneeds. On  13  April  2020,  President  Widodo declared the  COVID-19  pandemic  a  national \nemergency.19 On 13 March 2020, the government established a COVID-19 task force chaired by \nthe head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency with senior representatives from the Ministry \nof Health, the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, Indonesian Military, and the National Police. \nThe central government also issued a regulation to allow local governments to formally restrict \nthe movement of people and goods in their territory with approval from the minister of health.20 \nMeasures to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control are summarized in Table 3.  \n \nTable 3: Summary of Measures to Bring the COVID-19 Pandemic Under Control \nMeasure  Description \nPreparedness plan  The plan, based on technical advice from the World Health Organization, details: \n(i) clinical management, particularly of critical cases; (ii) infection prevention and \ncontrol among health workers and the general population; and (iii) specimen \nmanagement and laboratory confirmation to reduce the spread of COVID-19. \nSocial distancing  Some local governments have introduced social distancing measures to contain \nthe disease, such as a ban on mass gatherings, temporary closure of schools and \ntourist attractions, limitations of religious activities, and urged \u2018physical distancing\u2019 \nto reduce transmission. People may still travel to fulfil basic needs.  \nMedical personnel  In addition to 40,320 specialist doctors, the government has deployed students \nfrom 158 universities and 15,000 volunteers. Medical personnel are promised \nbonuses (Rp15 million for specialist doctors, Rp10 million for general practitioners, \nRp7.5  million  for  midwives  and  nurses,  and  Rp5  million  for  other  medical \npersonnel). \nTest kits and  The  government  has  made  available  approximately  1  million  kits  for  mass \nequipment  screening, while prioritizing government workers for testing. Across 2,867 hospitals \nthroughout Indonesia, there are 8,413 ventilators available. \nRepurposing and  The  government  designated  132  referral  hospitals  containing  approximately \nbuilding of facilities  41,000 beds for COVID-19 and repurposed the athletes\u2019 village used for the 2018 \nAsian Games in Jakarta into an emergency hospital containing 1,800 beds. The \ngovernment purchased 175,000 new sets of protective equipment. 13 medical \nschools and 13 teaching hospitals were upgraded to serve as extra COVID-19 \nlaboratories.  \nVisa suspension  The  government  temporarily  suspended  visa  issuance  for  all  countries  and \nexpanded restrictions to people from the worst-hit countries. \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, Rp= rupiah. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n \n19 On 28 January 2020, the government issued a disaster emergency decree, allowing the utilization of special fund to \nfight COVID-19, initially valid until 28 February 2020 and subsequently extended to 29 May 2020. \n20 Such restrictions have now been imposed in a number of provinces including Jakarta. \n ", "8 \n17.  Public spending on health will be increased substantially. Prior to COVID-19, the \ngovernment mandated that 5% of the total national budget be spent on health. Accordingly, $7.6 \nbillion\u2014comprising $5.6 billion for central government and $2.0 billion for regional transfers\u2014had \noriginally been allocated for 2020.21 This indicates approximately 13% growth in the budget \nbetween 2019 and 2020. To meet additional resource requirements because of COVID-19, the \ngovernment has allocated an additional $4.3 billion for health, equivalent to 13.3% of the total \nstimulus package ($32.4 billion).22 With this additional allocation, the health budget will increase \nto an all-time high of 8.1% of the national budget. Of these funds, $3.8 billion will be used for \n\"health management expenditures\" such as medical devices and equipment, and health facilities \nand infrastructure. Subsidy contributions to the national health insurance fund will also be \nincreased ($171 million), especially for non-wage workers and the unemployed.23 Remaining \nresources will be spent on incentives for medical personnel over the next 6 months ($337 million), \ndeath benefits for health workers ($17 million), and other human resources support. Support for \nhealth workers is particularly important, given the significant strain that COVID-19 poses on the \nprofession. Such support will also be particularly beneficial for women. Of the over 1 million \nmedical professionals, 71% are female, with the ratio being 64% for general practitioners, 80% \nfor pharmacists, and 68% for nurses.24 In addition to national measures, Indonesia has also \ncommitted to regional sharing of data and lessons learned.25   \n \n18.  The government has formulated a strong pro-poor countercyclical expenditure \nplan.  The  government  has  announced  fiscal  measures  worth  $32.4  billion  that  will  fund \nsubstantially increased public health measures, social assistance to the poor and vulnerable, and \nsupport to businesses (Table 4). A key component of the fiscal measures is to support enterprises \nincluding  affected  micro,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs).  This  includes  the \nnational recovery program, which will target real and finance sectors amounting to $8.9 billion. \nMeasures also include capital injection, credit restructuring and financing, as well as business \nfunding guarantees. The government will subsidize interest for MSMEs credit and will provide \ntransfers to subnational governments for tax waivers. The government is providing relief to \nmanufacturing workers by extending a tax holiday for workers with an annual income of less than \n$14,000. It is supporting the productive sectors by lowering corporate taxes, suspending import \ntaxes, and accelerating valued-added tax restitution for 19 manufacturing subsectors for up to 6 \nmonths. In addition to the new resources allocated, President Widodo instructed all ministries and \nlocal governments to limit their budget spending, so that funds can be reallocated to tackle the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and to maintain people\u2019s purchasing power. The government is closely \nmonitoring the situation and considering further fiscal stimulus measures as needed. The fiscal \nimpact of the stimulus packages could be significant in restarting growth in the economy due to \nthe multiplier effects of their spending and tax relief components. Preliminary estimates by ADB \nshow that the overall impact of the $32.4 billion fiscal package (2.7% of GDP) could lead to a \ncumulative increase in real GDP of $38.2 billion after one year, and $44.4 billion after two years, \nequivalent to 3.2% and 3.7% of GDP, respectively.26 \n \n \n \n \n21 https://www.kemenkeu.go.id/apbn2020. \n22 Total health package is $4.48billion is the sum of $4.3 billion in additional to $180 million of budget reallocation. \n23 Press Conference: Measures to Strengthen Protection and Economic Stimulus Facing the Impact of Covid-19, 1 April \n2020. \n24 Ministry of Health. 2019.

The government has expanded social assistance. In addition to the increased budget \nallocation to the health sector (para. 15), the government is providing additional social assistance \nto poor and vulnerable households during the COVID-19 pandemic through its flagship social \nassistance and social protection programs, amounting to $6.4 billion (Table 5).27 While these \nprograms are available for all poor and vulnerable groups (as defined under a registry held by the \nMinistry of Social Affairs), two programs specifically target mothers and children. Under the Family \nHope Program (PKH), a conditional cash transfer program, women are encouraged to utilize \nhealth facilities for prenatal and antenatal care and ensure that children attend school. Women \nare also usually the attendees of the family development sessions, which are learning sessions \non topics such as health, nutrition and early learning. The Kartu Sembako food assistance \nprogram provides basic commodities to mothers, who are usually responsible for buying and \ncooking for the household. In addition, electricity subsidies and housing incentives for the poor \nare included. These social assistance programs complement additional funds for social protection \nprograms such as education subsidies, strengthening market and logistics operations, and the \nKartu Pra Kerja program, which subsidizes vouchers for unemployed workers for skilling and re-\nskilling.  \n \n \n27 There is robust evidence showing the positive outcomes of the social and food assistance programs on health, \neducation  and  social  welfare.

The  government  has  announced  various  non-fiscal  measures  to  support \nbusinesses. The government\u2019s package includes the simplification of requirements for imports \nand  exports,  including  raw  materials,  to  increase  the  competitiveness  of  enterprises.  The \ngovernment also reduced the number of import procedures for strategic food products such as \nsalt, sugar, flour, corn, meat, and potatoes. Employers in affected sectors are supported through \nthe temporary suspension of mandated contributions to death and accident insurance, which \nreduces enterprise operating costs. \n  \n21.  Regulatory non-fiscal measures to support MSMEs and workers. The Financial \nServices Authority (OJK) issued a regulation in March 2020 to enable banks to support MSMEs \naffected by COVID-19. Banks can provide loans of up to $600,000 equivalent based on a debtor\u2019s \ncredit history with relaxed requirements for business prospects, financial condition, and debt \nquality assessment thus allowing banks to restructure existing MSMEs loans. Based on this new \nrule, the four state-owned banks have collectively restructured approximately $1.84 billion of \nloans. These measures will help reduce the adverse impact on banks as well as increase access \nto credit for MSMEs.  The government is accelerating the rollout of Kartu Pra Kerja program (para. \n17) and has doubled the allocation to the program. The program will benefit 5.6 million informal \nworkers. In addition, workers who have lost their job may apply for early withdrawal of savings \nfrom the provident fund.  \n \n22.  Coordinated monetary and financial sector supervision responses. In Indonesia, \ncoordination between the MOF, Bank Indonesia, and the OJK has been very close in recent years \nreflecting the government\u2019s commitment to financial stability.28 All three have coordinated their \npolicy responses for COVID-19 quite closely. To help counter the economic slowdown, Bank \n \n28 In 2015, the government established the Financial Sector Stability Forum, which comprises the MOF, Bank \nIndonesia, OJK, and the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation. The forum covers surveillance, exchange of \ninformation, and implementation of crisis management protocols. \n ", "11 \nIndonesia lowered its policy rate, the 7-day reverse repurchase rate, in February and March 2020 \nby a total of 50 basis points to 4.5%. Bank Indonesia lowered the reserve requirements for \ncommercial  banks from  8%  to  4%  and  extended  the  government  securities  repo  tenor  to  \n12 months, with daily auctions to ensure rupiah banking liquidity. On 31 March 2020, the \ngovernment issued a government regulation-in-lieu-of-law that allows the Indonesia Deposit \nInsurance Corporation to merge banks and carry out bailouts to address strains on the banking \nsystem. It will also allow the central bank to buy government debt directly (in addition to purchases \nvia the secondary market, as has been the practice), with the proceeds being used to provide \nsupport to distressed companies and provide the government with liquidity to implement its \ncountercyclical measures.  \n \n23.  To support exchange rate stability, minimize speculation, and smooth investment outflows, \nBank Indonesia strengthened interventions in the bond, spot, and domestic non-deliverable \nforward (DNDF) markets. This involves broadening the collateral used for DNDF transactions to \ninclude proceeds from the sale of government bonds and including DNDF as part of banks\u2019 net \nopen positions to mitigate the spike in the rupiah hedging cost. Interventions in the first quarter of \n2020 helped preserve local currency money market liquidity, despite capital outflows. In addition, \nto alleviate foreign exchange pressures and increase foreign exchange liquidity in the banking \nsubsector, Bank Indonesia committed to remaining in the market to stabilize the rupiah by selling \ndollars through spot and DNDF. Bank Indonesia also agreed on a $60 billion repo deal with the \nUS Federal Reserve to boost dollar liquidity supply in addition to existing bilateral swaps. As of  \n12 March 2020, Bank Indonesia had purchased Rp130 trillion ($8.2 billion) worth of government \nbonds since the beginning of the year to moderate capital outflow.  \n \n24.  Indonesia  had  demonstrated  sound  macroeconomic  management  prior  to  the \nshock. The fiscal position of Indonesia has been maintained at a healthy level, with the fiscal \ndeficit below the legally stipulated ceiling of 3% of GDP between 2000 and 2019 and the debt-to-\nGDP ratio remaining low and sustainable. Inflation has been at the lower end of the central bank\u2019s \ntarget range and official reserves remain ample to cover imports and debt repayment. Indonesia \nhas effectively managed past external headwinds through sound macroeconomic management.29 \nFinally,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  2017  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  (PEFA) \nassessment noted that Indonesia has a well-functioning public financial management (PFM) \nsystem.30 It concluded that Indonesia has a strong legal and regulatory framework, especially on \nfiscal management and control of budget execution.  \n \n25.  ADB has longstanding engagement in public sector management.31 In 2002, ADB \nhelped  set  up  national and  subnational  public expenditure  management systems  after  the \nintroduction  of  decentralization  reforms.  This  was  followed  by  ADB  support  in  2005  for \ngovernment efforts to build a modern national PFM system, including a public debt management \noffice. In 2008, ADB provided support to introduce financial management information systems in \n147 local governments and to decentralize the tax framework. Since 2012, ADB has provided \ntechnical assistance to improve the fiscal sustainability of social security, strengthen the fiscal \ndecentralization framework, and improve the fiscal risk management of contingent liabilities \narising  from  accelerated  infrastructure  investment.  During  2016\u20132019,  ADB  assisted  the \n \n29 https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2019/07/31/pr19305-indonesia-imf-executive-board-concludes-2019-article-iv \n-consultation-with-indonesia \n30 World Bank. 2017.

Indonesia is committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \nThe government has mapped the SDGs targets against targets in its National Medium-Term \nDevelopment Strategy. It established a national coordination team for SDG implementation, \nchaired by President Widodo, to oversee SDG implementation progress. The government also \nlaunched an SDG road map, which includes a financing chapter for SDG implementation. The \nroad  map  assesses  the  costs  of  the  various  SDG  programs,  government  resources,  and \ninnovative means to enable private sector financing. The government\u2019s commitment to the SDGs \nis reflected in its increased budget allocation for pro-poor expenditure.  \n \n27.  Lessons learned. ADB has provided two countercyclical programs in Indonesia, in 2009 \nand in 2012 (precautionary financing option). The CARES program benefited from lessons \nlearned from both program completion reports (PCR).32 First, Indonesia\u2019s fiscal stimulus package \nduring 2009 was successful because measures included tax cuts, social spending, and labor-\nintensive small-scale infrastructure projects, coupled with effective and regular monitoring and \nreporting mechanisms. The CARES program includes an elaborate monitoring and reporting \nmechanism  including  committees  involving  government,  private  sector  and  civil  society \norganizations that will be active throughout the implementation period. Second, the PCR found \nthat the 2009 CSF would have been more effective had it been in place at the time the global \nfinancial crisis began in the third quarter of 2008. This is a strong rationale for early processing of \nthe CARES program to assist the government\u2019s timely action to stabilize the economy. Third, the \n2012 precautionary financing facility was part of a contingent financing option provided by ADB, \nthe Government of Australia, the Government of Japan, and the World Bank. The government \nbenefited from the partnership with cofinanciers through the provision of high-quality economic \nsurveillance. ADB is also collaborating closely with other development partners, including the IMF, \nin the design of the CARES program. Some development partners have indicated interest in \ncofinancing the program.  \n \nB.  Proposed Program, Impacts and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n28.  The CARES program will support the government in its continuing effort to address critical \npublic health risks while also managing a sharp economic downturn, particularly through timely \ncountercyclical fiscal measures. ADB\u2019s budget support will allow the government to protect \nurgently needed social expenditures and expand its social assistance programs for the poor, \nincluding households headed by women, elderly people, and people with disabilities, to reduce \nthe adverse social and economic impacts of COVID-19. The CARES program is aligned with  \n(i) ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Indonesia, 2016\u20132019, especially with its focus on \neconomic governance and disaster risk management; and (ii) ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, in particular \nthe operational priorities on addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, accelerating \nprogress in gender equality, and fostering regional cooperation and integration.33  \n \n29.  The impact of the program will be that adverse impacts of COVID-19 on health, livelihoods \nand economy are mitigated. The outcome will be that COVID-19 outbreak more effectively \nmanaged and its social and economic damages mitigated, which will be achieved through the \n \n32 ADB.  2011.

ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s support for the COVID-19 response builds on its long-\nstanding partnership with Indonesia especially in the areas of economic governance and reform \nand disaster and emergency risk management and finance. ADB\u2019s financial support package to \nthe  government  in  responding  to  the  COVID  situation  includes  a  closely  linked  and  well \nsequenced set of support measures involving: (i) quick disbursing budget support through the \nCARES program to bolster critical public spending and countercyclical fiscal stimulus; (ii) health \nsector emergency support; (iii) disaster risk financing; and (iv) structural reform support to bolster \neconomic recovery. The financial support package is complemented by technical advice and \nknowledge support. ADB closely engages with MOF\u2019s Fiscal Policy Agency to jointly analyze and \nmonitor the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic. The analysis supports policy development \nand provides diagnostics to inform development financing needs and initiatives to be included in \nfuture fiscal measures. Through technical assistance, ADB is also strengthening the capacity of \nPKH and Kartu Sembako program facilitators, supporting the formulation of Kartu Pra Kerja \nprogram, and strategizing on maintaining supplies of basic food and protective equipment.  \n \n31.  ADB is likewise supporting the Ministry of Health in fast tracking the procurement of critical \nmedical equipment and supplies under a $3 million grant approved on 20 March 2020 with funding \nfrom  the  Asia  Pacific  Disaster  Response  Fund.34 In  addition  to  being  responsive  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s immediate financial needs in an emergency situation, ADB\u2019s response package, \nstarting with the proposed CARES program, is instrumental in catalyzing cofinancing from other \ndevelopment partners. Finally, a bespoke coordination and monitoring framework, agreed upon \nbetween the government and ADB, will support effective implementation of the CARES program \nand establish regional synergies with similar countercyclical support provided by ADB in other \ndeveloping member countries (para. 35). \n \n32.  In the area of structural reform, ADB is supporting several dimensions of the government\u2019s \ninvestment and competitiveness reform agenda. This includes supporting measures to simplify \nand expedite business licensing, improving linkages of Indonesian firms, particularly MSMEs, with \nglobal value chains, and developing labor regulations that balance competitiveness objectives \nwith skills development and social protection for Indonesian workers. To promote inclusive \ngrowth, ADB is supporting financial inclusion through reforms, service upgrades, innovations to \nenhance access and digital literacy. Finally, ADB is also processing a new regional technical \nassistance to assess the efficacy of the stimulus packages as well as draft medium-term recovery \nand transformational strategies for the post-COVID-19 era for selected countries in Southeast \nAsia, including Indonesia. This technical assistance will also be utilized for supporting the \nimplementation of the CARES Program (para. 35).  \n \nC.  Development Financing Needs, Budget Support and Debt Sustainability \n \n33.  Due to the adverse impact of COVID-19, the government\u2019s financing needs are projected \nto increase by $39.8 billion in 2020 (from $42.4 billion to $82.2 billion). The government plans to \nmeet the additional financing requirement through domestic ($28.9 billion) and foreign ($10.9 \nbillion) sources (Table 6).  \n \n \n34 https://www.adb.org/news/adb-approves-3-million-grant-support-indonesias-fight-against-covid-19. \n ", "14 \nTable 6: Urgent Financing Needs and Support for 2020 \n($ billion) \nItem  2020  2020  change \n(before   (adjusted for   (%) \nCOVID-19)  COVID-19) \nGross financing requirement  42.4  82.2  94 \nGross domestic financing  33.0  61.9  87 \nGross foreign financing  9.4  20.3  116 \nBond issuance  6.6   12.4    \nADB COVID-19 response  1.5 \nCARES program (CPRO)       \nADB originally programmed support   1.0   1.0   \nPromoting Innovative Financial Inclusion Program, SP1  0.5  0.5   \nCompetitiveness, Industrialization and Trade Acceleration Program, SP 1  0.5  0.5   \nContingent Disaster Financinga   0.5  0.5   \nWorld Bank  0.4  1.5b   \nOther Development Partners (AIIB, AfD, JICA, KfW)  1.4  2.8   \nOther Development Partners (TBD)    1.1   \nADB = Asian Development Bank; AfD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement; AIIB = Asian Infrastructure Investment \nBank; CARES = COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; CPRO = \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response Option; JICA = Japan International Cooperation Agency; KfW = Kreditanstalt fuer \nWiederaufbau; TBD = to be determined.  \na  The Contingent Disaster Financing, programmed for 2020, is reflected for transparency, but is not included in the \ntotal for ADB originally programmed support, as it may not be drawn upon given its contingent nature.  \nb  Includes Program-for-Results Financing. \nSource: Asian Development Bank calculations \n \n34.  The government has requested two loans, comprised of, (i) a regular loan of \u20ac462,920,000 \n($500 million equivalent), and (ii) a regular loan of \u20ac925,840,000 ($1 billion equivalent), both from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to provide countercyclical budgetary support for the economic \nrecovery and much-needed public health programs.35 The first euro-denominated loan will have \na 10-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. For the first euro-denominated loan, based on the straight-line method, the \naverage maturity is 6.75 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The second \neuro-denominated loan will have a 5-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement. For the second euro-denominated loan, based on the straight-line method, the \naverage maturity is 4.25 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The total size \nof the loans is based on Indonesia\u2019s financing needs, and development spending arising from the \ndevelopment expenditure programs. The loans are expected to be disbursed in April 2020.  \n \n35.  Debt sustainability. In July 2019, IMF assessed Indonesia external and public debt to be \nmoderate and sustainable.36 The ratio of central government debt to GDP is expected to increase \nfrom 29.8% in 2019 to 37.8% in 2020 and decline to 37.1% in 2021 under a baseline scenario of \nthe rupiah depreciating by 19.5% and GDP growth declining to 2.3% in 2020 due to COVID-19. \nThe projection of the debt-to-GDP ratio for 2020 indicates that the central government\u2019s debt \nwould be sustainable if assumptions were to be realized. With the proposed CARES program of \n$1.5 billion equivalent, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by 0.2% (from 37.8% to 38.0% in \n2020).37 The existing debt ratio and projected public indebtedness, including the potential impact \n \n35 Euro 0.92584 = $1.00 as of 9 April 2020. \n36 IMF. 2019.

The medium-term \noutlook is acceptable in terms of creditworthiness. \n \nD.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n36.  ADB coordinates its COVID-19 response support closely with other development partners, \nunder the overall lead of the government. As for the public health policy response, WHO is the \ntechnical lead partner and has provided the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for \nCOVID-19, which has been applied by the government in forming its own plan. It also helps to \ncoordinate among United Nations agencies, with non-governmental organizations, and other \ndevelopment partners working on COVID-19. Other development partners involved in public \nhealth include the Government of Australia, United Nations agencies, United States Agency for \nInternational Development, and the World Bank, among others. ADB works closely with the \nMinistry of Health and Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency, and in collaboration with \nWHO and UNICEF, on the procurement of critical medical equipment and supplies. For economic \nand fiscal support, ADB has been coordinating with the IMF in assessing the economic impact of \nCOVID-19, helping the government develop effective stimulus programs, and designing the \nproposed CARES program for which the IMF has provided an assessment letter.38 At the request \nof the government, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and German development \nassistance through KfW have both indicated their intentions to provide cofinancing for the CARES \nprogram. KfW has proposed parallel cofinancing of \u20ac250 million and the loan size for AIIB is yet \nto be determined. Both AIIB and KfW will disburse their cofinancing directly to the government.39  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n37.  The Fiscal Policy Agency of the MOF will be the executing agency for the program. To \nsupport effective implementation of the program, a country engagement framework has been \nestablished between ADB and the government. The framework focuses on (i) policy dialogue,  \n(ii) monitoring, and (iii) reporting of the government\u2019s countercyclical strategy and measures. The \nframework will also be used to identify gaps and analysis required that will enable ADB to channel \nsupport including through technical assistances. For instance, the regional technical assistance \nthat is being processed can provide inputs on the efficacy of government\u2019s measures as well as \nrecovery strategies. The framework includes a policy committee to guide and monitor the overall \nimplementation of the countercyclical measures. The policy committee will be supported by a \ntechnical committee which will provide inputs including monitoring of the government\u2019s overall \nresponse measures and the gender monitoring matrix.  Three sub-committees will facilitate \nengagement with the private sector, civil society organizations, and entities that focus on big data \nanalytics  to  drive  innovative  solutions  based  on  the  latest  available  data.40 Government \nrepresentatives on the (sub)committees will include officials from the MOF and other ministries \nas appropriate. The frequency of the meetings will be at least once every quarter. The program \nimplementation period is April 2020\u2013March 2021. The proceeds of the loans will be withdrawn in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \n \n38 IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40 Country Engagement Framework for COVID-19 Response to Indonesia (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2).  \n ", "16 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n38.  Governance. In 2017, Indonesia scored either A or B (both considered above basic \nalignment with international good practice) on 17 of 31 indicators in the World Bank\u2019s PEFA report. \nIndicators with particularly good assessment results include transparency of public finance, and \naccounting and reporting. Government regulations issued in 2017 strengthened the legal and \nregulatory frameworks for PFM, mandating coordination between the National Development \nPlanning Agency and the MOF in planning, budgeting, and subsequent regulations. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment. \n \n39.  Poverty and inequality. As millions of wage and non-wage workers are on the verge of \nlosing jobs because of business disruptions and the sudden stop in economic activity, the \nproposed CARES program is crucial to uphold the declining trends of poverty and inequality. \nPoverty in Indonesia consistently declined from a peak of 24.2% in 1999 to 9.2% in September \n2019. Expenditure inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, was estimated at 0.31 in 1999 \nand rose to 0.41 in 2011, where it stayed until 2015, before gradually declining to 0.38 in 2019. \nThese improvements are linked with low inflation, the growing formal economy, the upscaling of \nsocial assistance, and investment. The government\u2019s stimulus packages supported under the \nproposed program will help mitigate COVID-19\u2019s impact with timely and effective health and social \nassistance measures that shield the vulnerable population\u2014especially women, elderly people, \nand those with disabilities\u2014against price and income shocks. Simulation results indicate that the \nexpected rise in the poverty rate by up to 3.0% from the baseline of 9.4% could be mitigated \nthrough the provision of additional social assistance transfers by the government.  \n \n40.  Gender. The CARES program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming at entry. \nWhile the CARES program is for budget support, the focus of the support under the program is \nthe expansion of social assistance programs for the poor and vulnerable with clear linkages to \nwomen\u2019s welfare. First, the government proposes to increase the total beneficiaries of the PKH \nconditional cash transfer program from 9.2 million to 10 million, including households headed by \nwomen. The PKH provides conditional cash transfer to female beneficiaries in the identified \nrecipient households thereby ensuring that women have access to and control over family-related \nbudgetary decision-making.41 This is in line with the United Nations\u2019 recommendation for cash \ntransfers to be targeted to women.42 The PKH also provide women with access to counselling, \nmaternal and child health programs, and economic empowerment training. Additional resources, \nincluding from the CARES program, will enable the government to increase the transfers by 25%, \nincluding for pregnant women from Rp2.4 million to Rp3 million per year. Second, the government \nproposes to increase the total beneficiaries of the Kartu Sembako program from 15.2 million to \n20 million households, representing a 30% cash increase from Rp150,000 to Rp200,000, for  \n9 months. More than 90% of the Kartu Sembako program recipients are women, including 16% \nfemale-headed households. Third, the government proposes to provide 6-months of income tax \nrelief to manufacturing workers with annual incomes less than $14,000 and at least 75% of female \nmanufacturing workers will qualify for the relief. Finally, gender-responsive budgeting will be \napplied to the monitoring and evaluation of these and other social assistance programs for poor \nand vulnerable households. To supplement the CARES program, a technical assistance from the \n \n41 Based on data from April 2020, 8,616,758 of 9,214,143 PKH households have women receiving transfers into their \nbank accounts which equates to at least 90% of beneficiaries being women (based on number of bank account \nholders). \n42 https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/put-women-and-girls-centre-efforts-recover-covid-19. \n ", "17 \nCOVID-19 TASF Special Pool Resources is being prepared to respond to the gender-related \nimpacts of COVID-19 including support for domestic and/or gender-based violence. \n \n41.  Safeguards. The program will not have any adverse social or environmental safeguard \nimpacts and will not trigger ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). It is classified category C \nfor environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \n42.  Risks and mitigating measures.

Adverse impact of  Indonesia has experienced a severe decline in growth and fiscal stress as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. \nexogenous shocks   As of 15 April 2020, Indonesia had 5,136 positive cases and 469 deaths (Figure 1). Three regions\u2014Jakarta, \nWest Java Bali, and Banten\u2014have been hit particularly hard. However, there is concern that these figures do \nnot show the complete picture due to large numbers of undetected cases arising from the low number of tests \ncarried out. Some models suggest that the true number of positive cases could be between 70,000 and \n250,000, and by the end of April 2020, the number could be as high as 1 million. \n \nWith the outbreak of COVID-19, Indonesia is experiencing sudden capital outflow due to change in global risk \nsentiment resulting in investors exiting emerging markets. In the first quarter of 2020, net foreign outflow \nreached $10.5 billion, which included $9.6 billion in bond and $900 million in equity market. These reversals \nincreased bond yields by nearly 200 basis points (Figure 3a) and the rupiah depreciated by approximately \n20% to Rp16,741\u2014to levels last seen during the Asian financial crisis in 1998. \n \nSimulation results using Indonesia\u2019s computable general equilibrium model (IndoTerm) indicate that a 1-month \nnational disruption could result in a drop in the output of hotels by 11.54% and of restaurants by 7.86% in \n2020. Transport, construction, food processing, and other manufacturing outputs would also suffer seriously. \nThe most severely affected regions of Banten, Jakarta, and Bali will see a sharp deviation from their baseline \ngrowth in 2020. The government projects 2020 to produce the lowest economic growth level in 21 years \n(2.3%), down from an original estimate of 5.2%, with employment loss projected at as many as 7 million. It is \nestimated that the national poverty rate may increase from a baseline of 9.4% in March 2019 to 11.8%\u201312.8% \nin 2020. \n \nThe central government\u2019s revenue and grants in 2020 are projected to reduce to $101 billion from the pre- \nCOVID-19 projection of $128 billion, with further downside risk. In the second quarter alone, revenue is \nexpected to reduce by 20% year-on-year. The fall in revenue is a result of general economic slowdown as well \nas tax reliefs provided as part of the fiscal measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Continued lower \ncommodity prices will affect export earnings. Public expenditure is projected to increase to $149 billion from \n$145 billion, in part because of unplanned expenditures related to COVID-19. The fiscal deficit for 2020 is \nexpected to increase to $51.7 billion (5.1% of GDP), and the gross financing needs are expected to increase \nfrom $52 billion to $87 billion. \n2. Counter cyclical  The government has an effective pro-poor countercyclical expenditure program that will be supported by the \ndevelopment expenditures  CARES program under the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option, which focus on social, health, and \neconomic dimensions: (i) additional allocation of social assistance programs for the poor and vulnerable \nimplemented; (ii) dedicated fund for COVID-19 prevention and control established; (iii) productive sectors \nsafeguarded and manufacturing workers supported from the economic downturn. About 20.2% of the package, \n$6.5 billion, will be in the form of social assistance programs for poor and vulnerable households. \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n  The government has unveiled three fiscal packages to fund substantially increased public health measures, \nsocial assistance to the poor and vulnerable, and support to businesses worth $32.4 billion. In health, a key \nchange is the inclusion of COVID-19 in the health insurance benefits package through increased allocations. \nCurrently, approximately 222 million people are enrolled in health insurance, of whom 131 million receive state \nsubsidies for premia. This ensures the poor in society are not impeded from accessing facilities due to cost \nconstraints. In addition to the increased allocation to the health sector, the government is providing additional \nsocial assistance to poor and vulnerable households during the COVID-19 pandemic through two key social \nassistance programs, the Family Hope Program (PKH), and Kartu Sembako.  \n \nWhile both programs are available for all poor and vulnerable groups (as defined through a registry held by \nthe  Ministry  of  Social  Affairs),  they  particularly  target  mothers  and  children.  Under  PKH,  women  are \nencouraged to utilize health facilities for prenatal -and antenatal care, and for children to attend school; further, \nwomen are usually the attendees of family development sessions on topics such as health, nutrition and early \nlearning. Under Kartu Sembako program, mothers are usually responsible for buying and cooking the food for \nthe household. In addition, electricity subsidies and housing incentives for the poor are included. These social \nassistance programs complement additional funds for social protection programs such as education subsidies, \nstrengthening market and logistics operations, and the Kartu Pra Kerja program.
