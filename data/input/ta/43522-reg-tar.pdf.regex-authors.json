INTRODUCTION \n1.  Affordable and sustainable energy services using renewable energy are among the \nessential  ingredients  of  low-carbon  economic  development.  The  international  community \nemphasizes the importance of technology for sustainable development and for meeting climate \nchange challenges in a reasonable time frame, both in developed and developing countries.  \n \n2.  Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) states (i) ADB will strengthen the \nfocus of its operations on the environment to realize environmentally sustainable growth for the \nregion; (ii) ADB will expand promotion of and investment in sound environmental management, \nwhile  simultaneously  capitalizing  on  the  strengths  of  its  operations,  such  as  infrastructure \ndevelopment and finance; and (iii) in its programs, policies, and strategies, ADB will emphasize \nclimate change aspects where it could help developing member countries (DMCs) move their \neconomies to low-carbon growth paths, by, among others, expanding the use of clean energy \nsources.1 \n \n3.  The  Energy  Policy,  2009  recognizes  ADB's  role  in  developing  renewable  energy, \nfacilitating  wider  deployment  of  technologies  by  raising  awareness,  promoting  policy  and \nregulatory incentives to encourage their use, and promoting financing packages that share risks \nand  lower  cost.2 The  policy  states  that  ADB  will  support  technology  transfer  for  cleaner \ntechnologies in the DMCs through demonstration projects. For South Asian DMCs, solar energy \ncompares favorably with other common renewable energy sources, such as wind and small \nhydropower. In addition, the modular nature of the technology and relative ease of installation in \ninhabited areas are considered beneficial. In this context, ADB notes the need to (i) identify key \nsolar energy technologies relevant to South Asian DMCs and potential opportunities for end-use \napplications for these technologies, and (ii) develop an enabling environment for the deployment \nof these technologies. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Deployment of solar technologies. Solar energy technologies are increasingly being \nconsidered an important element for sustainable development and to address climate change \nconcerns.  The  worldwide  capacity  of  one  form  of  solar  energy  technology,  namely  grid-\nconnected solar photovoltaic generators, reached 13 gigawatts in 2008 (an increase of 70% \ncompared to the previous year).3 Of particular relevance to the South Asian DMC context is the \nfact that solar energy could assist in addressing multiple imperatives such as energy security, \nelectrification in remote areas, employment generation, provision of resilient livelihoods; and \ncould potentially drive inclusive economic growth in remote areas.   \n \n5.  Solar power generation technologies can broadly be categorized into (i) large power \nplants using concentrated solar power and solar photovoltaic technologies, (ii) small power \nplants based on distributed on-grid or off-grid solar photovoltaic systems. In addition, associated \ntechnologies are being developed for grid management (to enable stable and measurable two-\nway power supply) and power storage (e.g., using lithium-ion batteries). \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n3  In  addition,  grid-connected  solar  photovoltaic  has  been  identified  as  the  fastest-growing  power  generation \ntechnology worldwide with a six-fold increase in global capacity since 2004. Renewable Energy Policy Network for \nthe 21st Century (REN21). 2009. Renewables Global Status Report: 2009 Update. Paris: REN21 Secretariat. \n ", "2 \n \n6.  Deployment of solar and associated technologies in the DMCs is particularly important \nbecause (i) the learning curve and scale of production effects based on increased demand from \nemerging markets could cause production costs to converge toward grid parity pricing, and (ii) \nsome DMCs are in a more advantageous position compared with developed countries in terms \nof,  for  example,  higher  solar  radiation,  more  rapidly  growing  electricity  demand,  and  land \navailability.4 As a result, the DMCs could play a pivotal role as global and regional technology \nhubs for manufacturing solar technology related goods and equipment that could significantly \nbolster solar-based power generation capacity with its implications for sustainable economic \ngrowth.         \n \n7.  Most of the DMCs, particularly in South Asia, lag in the development and deployment of \nsolar energy technologies, partly because of perceptions of high costs, but also importantly \nbecause of (i) limited access to the latest technology and knowledge in the area, (ii) institutional \ncapacity constraints among stakeholders to further solar energy-related developments, and \n(iii) lack of government formulation or implementation of an appropriate policy and regulatory \nframework in most DMCs to encourage offtake from solar energy sources. In addition, most of \nthe global private sector focus is presently concentrated in developed country markets in terms \nof financial resources and human expertise. As a result, despite attractive factors including the \nsize of the potential market and the beneficial impact of deploying solar-based technologies in \nsuch  markets,  international  developers  and  equipment  suppliers  tend  to  be  reluctant  to \nparticipate in the development of large-scale solar photovoltaic and concentrated solar power \nprojects in the emerging DMCs. \n \n8.  Several South Asian DMCs have implemented small-scale pilot solar photovoltaic and \nsolar home systems to provide electrification especially in remote areas. While several such \nsystems are successfully deployed, there are concerns related to the cost of deployment and \nthe sustainability of operations. Support will be required for the following activities: (i) research \nand development support to reduce the cost of local component manufacturing, assembly, and \ndeployment; (ii) development of a policy framework to ensure appropriate links with existing \nremote area electrification policies and promotion of appropriate system sizes and technologies \n(including  through  subsidy  intervention  and  fiscal  incentives)  especially  to  disadvantaged \nhouseholds with no access to alternate clean energy sources; (iii) capacity development through \ntraining for maintenance of solar energy systems in remote areas; and (iv) innovative financing \nmechanisms  and  institutional  support  for  household  electrification  and  community  income \ngeneration through solar energy systems. ADB could support South Asian DMCs on these \nissues through sharing of knowledge and best practices from other similarly placed countries in \nthese areas. \n \n9.  Climate change adaptation. The South Asian DMCs have initiated measures to cope \nwith climate change. Several countries have developed their initial climate change action plans \nand constituted institutional mechanisms to focus on climate change. Strategy 2020 states that \nADB  will  help  DMCs  adapt  to  the  unavoidable  impacts  of  climate  change.  From  a  solar \ndevelopment perspective, ADB could support the usage of solar energy-based systems to serve \nas an early warning system for events such as glacial melting; sea-level rise; and other extreme \nweather events such as floods, and changes in rainfall and cropping patterns; and for coping \n                                                 \n4  There is scope for further reducing the cost of energy from renewable sources by developing more appropriate \ntechnologies for the Asian region, promoting regional manufacture of renewable energy equipment, and exploiting \nscale economies arising from increased penetration of renewable energy technologies in the Asian region.

", "3 \nsystems to address environmental, health, and disaster management-related incidents arising \nfrom such events. \n \n10.  Coordination with other agencies. While ADB and other development partners have \nprovided assistance for rural electrification using solar energy, these instances tend to be \nisolated  and  have  few  opportunities  to  share  knowledge  and  disseminate  best  practices, \nparticularly beyond a country or region. As a result, a solar divide could result, where developing \ncountries may not receive adequate benefit of environment-friendly technology-driven economic \ngrowth.  \n \n11.  Therefore,  ADB  aims  to  provide  integrated  and  collective  support  to  the  DMCs  to \ndevelop  and  deploy  solar  power  generation  and  the  synergized  technologies  through  \n(i) communication to identify opportunities for solar energy development among participating \nSouth Asian DMCs, (ii) knowledge sharing on best practices for solar energy development,  \n(iii) development of solar energy projects based on the lessons from past efforts of ADB and \nother development partners, and (iv) a collective capacity development program. From this \nperspective, ADB setup a solar technology team under the energy community of practice in \nOctober 2010 to begin work on a road map for integrated solar energy development. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n12.  The  cluster  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  aims  to  promote  solar  energy \ndevelopment  among  participating  South  Asian  DMCs.  It  will  contribute  to  an  advanced \nunderstanding of opportunities for solar energy development in the region, actions required to \naccelerate institutional and business models for development and deployment of solar energy, \nand mechanisms to promote technology transfer to developing countries and to enhance the \nscope for cooperation on research and development. DMCs\u2019 experiences in other regions will \nbe  shared  in  cooperation  with  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of the TA will be the development of a sustainable solar energy sector in \nSouth Asia to support inclusive and low carbon economic growth. The outcome will be to create \nan enabling environment for the development of solar projects among South Asian DMCs.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA uses a cluster approach. Subproject 1 includes an opportunity assessment and \ncapacity development activities for South Asian DMC representatives. Seven key areas were \nidentified for subsequent subprojects; specific actions will be worked out during the course of TA \nimplementation.  Coordination  with  other  development  partners  will  be  undertaken  to  avoid \nduplication with other projects.  \n \n15.  Subproject 1: Opportunity assessment. As an initial step, an opportunity assessment \nfor solar energy development in South Asian DMCs will be undertaken to identify the enabling \nrequirements for (i) a policy and regulatory framework; (ii) industry development; (iii) project \ndevelopment; and (iv) research and development with an objective to (a) promote private sector \nparticipation,  (b)  facilitate  technology  transfer,  (c) enhance  knowledge  sharing,  and  (d) \n                                                 \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 November 2009.  \n ", "4 \n \nstrengthen institutional capacities of relevant stakeholders. In parallel, past projects in this \nsubsector supported by ADB and other development partners will be analyzed and a summary \nof lessons and relevant best practices collated. During the opportunity assessment, interviews \nwill  be  conducted  with  various  stakeholders,  in  particular,  international  private  investors, \nfinancing agencies, developers, utilities, consumers, equipment suppliers, and manufacturers.  \n \n16.  Subsequently,  a  workshop  will  be  held  to  share  the  findings  of  the  opportunity \nassessment  with  the  government,  regulatory  agencies,  and  knowledge  institutions  among \nparticipating  DMCs  in  South  Asia.  In  addition,  the  workshop  will  invite,  among  others, \ndevelopment  partners,  international  and  domestic  financiers,  investors,  developers, \nmanufacturers, and suppliers with expertise in concentrated solar power and solar photovoltaic \nproject  development,  and  associated  technologies  such  as  grid  management  and  battery \nmanufacturing. Resource persons with expertise in solar energy development will be invited to \nthe  workshop  to  share  best  practices  from  other  countries.  The  workshop  will  discuss \nopportunities, constraints, and possible road map for solar energy development in the DMCs to \nraise the awareness of stakeholders with regard to (i) appropriate technologies; (ii) gaps in \npolicy  and  regulatory  frameworks,  research  and  development,  project  development,  and \nindustry development; and (iii) potential action plans for the way forward.  \n \n17.  In particular, the workshop will (i) discuss how to develop commercially viable large-\nscale  and  distributed  concentrated  solar  power  and  solar  photovoltaic  projects  in  DMCs \ninvolving the private sector, (ii) assess past initiatives for off-grid electrification projects with \nsolar energy, (iii) identify lessons and best practices from other countries that have deployed \nsolar technologies, and (iv) discuss options for subsequent subprojects. The outcome of the \nworkshop will be summarized in a report to be published and posted on the ADB website. Other \nfollow-up action including identification of future subprojects will be undertaken.  \n \n18.   Subsequent subprojects. Support will be provided to the participating South Asian \nDMCs for the following potential subprojects.  \n \n(i)   Policy  and  regulatory  framework  development  and  implementation. \nAssistance  will  be  provided  to  develop  and  implement  solar  energy-related \npolicies as well as transparent and stable regulatory frameworks that support the \nprivate sector (investors, developers, manufacturers, and suppliers) as well as \nother  relevant  stakeholders,  such  as  consumers,  local  community,  and \nnongovernment organizations, on issues relating to solar energy and associated \ntechnology development.  \n \n(ii)   Institutional  capacity  development  for  solar  energy  development. \nAssistance will be provided for institutional capacity development of regulators, \ngovernment  officials,  private  sector  (such  as  domestic  developers, \nmanufacturers, and suppliers), consumers, local communities, nongovernment \norganizations, and utilities on issues relating to solar energy and associated \ntechnology development.    \n \n(iii)   Solar project feasibility study. Assistance to DMCs to conduct solar mapping \nstudies  and  other  prefeasibility  works  to  develop  solar  photovoltaic  and \nconcentrated solar power projects will be provided. Assistance for solar energy \nprojects in areas such as special economic zones may also be included.    \n ", "5 \n(iv)   Rural electrification using solar energy. Assistance to DMCs to develop and \nimplement business models for solar energy utilization and income generation on \nan off-grid or mini-grid basis will be undertaken.  \n \n(v)   Grid impact studies. Conceptualization of relevant smart grid and smart mini-\ngrid systems will be line with the DMC\u2019s environment, e.g., net-metering, current \nand voltage control, and battery deployment at substations. It could also include \nstudies to assess the impact of renewable energy on the grid. The studies could \nbe a basis for project preparation of future transmission and distribution projects \nor capacity development programs for transmission and distribution utilities.  \n \n(vi)   Innovative financing mechanisms. Development of various forms of financing, \nrisk mitigation, and financing models will make solar projects financially and \neconomically viable\u2014aiming to reduce capital costs, mitigate risks, and enhance \nfinancial viability for solar energy and associated technologies in DMCs, including \nmobilizing grant assistance, creating funds, activating programmatic  supports \nfrom mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism carbon credits, \nand securing regulatory incentives.  \n \n(vii)   Application to adaptation efforts. Assistance to South Asian DMCs to apply \nsolar  power  for  climate  change  adaptation-related  activities,  such  as  for \ndevelopment  of  systems  for  early  warning  and  disaster  management  in \necologically sensitive areas (e.g. glaciers and islands) will be considered.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,400,000; subproject 1 is estimated to cost $540,000. The \nTA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2014 \nother sources). Details are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency for this TA. The South Asia Department will work in \nclose  coordination  with  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  and  other \noperations departments on the TA. Each participating DMC may designate an existing agency \nas the focal point or the implementing agency for each subproject under the TA. Consultants will \nbe chosen for subproject 1 at TA startup. Consulting services for subsequent subprojects (e.g., \nprefeasibility studies, policy and regulatory review and implementation, institutional capacity \nbuilding) will be chosen during TA implementation depending on discussions with participating \nSouth Asian DMCs. \n \n21.  Subproject  1  will  require  one  international  consultant  for  6  person-months  (on  an \nintermittent basis) and one national consultant for 3 person-months to develop an opportunity \nassessment paper for solar energy development, conduct a workshop, and select potential \nactivities  for  subsequent  subprojects.  Both  the  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  individual \nconsultants. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).
