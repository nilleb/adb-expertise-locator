INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia has requested knowledge and support technical assistance \n(TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to build capacity to improve delivery of social \nwelfare benefits and services targeted to the poor and vulnerable. The TA will support improved \ncapacity for social workers and social protection policymakers; better delivery and monitoring of \ncommunity-based social welfare services; and more social welfare research, policy dialogue, and \nadvocacy. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2020\u2013\n20211 and is very strongly aligned with the Strategy 2030 operational priority of addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Mongolia\u2019s social protection system, especially social welfare (social assistance), has \nplayed a central role in fostering and protecting the country\u2019s gains in poverty reduction and \nhuman development, especially during periods of economic difficulties. From 2016 to 2018, the \nnumber of social welfare beneficiaries increased by 16.2%, while expenditure on social welfare \nbenefits increased by 29% to MNT619.8 billion.3 Expenditure increased mainly because three of \nthe largest programs expanded: child money, food stamps, and mothers\u2019 benefits.4 Nevertheless, \nthe poverty rate remained high at 28.4% in 2018, a decrease of just 1.2 percentage points from \nthe 2016 estimate of 29.6%.5 Many more people living just above the national average poverty \nline are vulnerable to falling back into extreme poverty.6 Mongolia\u2019s significant but fragile progress \nin social development underscores the need to further strengthen social protection.7 \n \n3.  The Social Welfare Law of 2012 defines four basic types of benefits: pensions, allowances, \nassistance and discounts, and services.8 Some target certain population groups, while others use \nthe national poverty targeting system, a proxy means test. With more than 60 distinct social \nwelfare benefits and more than 120 service providers accredited by the Ministry of Labor and \n \n1  ADB. 2019.

Based on a government request, the \nTA name has been modified from the original Capacity Building and Increasing Efficiency of Social Welfare Services. \nThe TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 November 2019. \n2   ADB. 2018.

Mongolia\u2019s Social Welfare System: Expenditure Allocation and Beneficiary Profile. Consultant's report. \nManila (TA 8845-MON, unpublished). Table 20 lists 60 distinct social welfare benefits by category, expenditure, \nnumber of beneficiaries, benefit amount, and frequency. The total number of beneficiaries does not represent unique \nindividuals, as many are eligible to receive more than one type of benefit. \n4  In this period, coverage of the food stamp program increased by nearly 50% to more than 253,000 individuals and \nbenefit levels increased by 20% to MNT16,000 per adult per month and MNT8,000 per child per month. The child \nmoney program, previously universal but reduced to 60% of all children ages 0\u201318 in the context of fiscal constraints \nin 2016, expanded back to 80%, providing MNT20,000 per month. Benefits for mothers expanded to provide \nMNT40,000 per month to more than 95,000 pregnant women from the fifth month of pregnancy and MNT50,000 per \nmonth to nearly 160,000 women who stay at home to provide full-time care to their children ages 0\u20133. These two \nprograms replaced the 2017 allowances for pregnant and lactating mothers that provided benefits to about 174,000 \nwomen. \n5  World Bank. 2019. Press Release: Mongolia\u2019s 2018 Poverty Rate Estimated at 28.4 Percent. Ulaanbaatar. \nhttps://www.worldbank.org/en/news/z4-release/2019/06/21/mongolias-2018-poverty-rate-estimated-at-284-percent. \n6  Mongolia\u2019s poverty line is the cost of a consumption bundle that provides 2,100 calories per person per day plus \nessential nonfood goods and services. The 2018 national poverty line was MNT166,580 per person per month (about \n$67.00 at the 2018 average exchange rate of MNT2,472 = $1.00). \n7  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2017\u20132020\u2014Sustaining Inclusive Growth in a Period of \nEconomic Difficulty. Manila. \n8  The government expects to adopt an update to the law by the end of 2019 (para. 6). \n \n ", "2 \nSocial Protection (MLSP) to provide community-based social welfare services, several challenges \nemerge. The system is complex and fragmented. Duplication and overlap of often very low benefit \nlevels lead to inefficient use of scarce resources. Some programs target certain population groups \nwho are not necessarily all poor. Others use the proxy means test, but inclusion and exclusion \nerrors\u2014a feature of any targeting system\u2014are a significant source of grievances and complaints. \nContracted community-based social welfare services reach relatively few people, and the quality \nof service delivery can be inconsistent, depending on the service provider. The contracting, \nmanagement, delivery, and monitoring of social welfare services all need strengthening. On \nbalance, the delivery of social welfare benefits and services to Mongolia\u2019s poor and vulnerable is \nless effective than it could be, which limits the impact on poverty and vulnerability. \n \n4.  The suboptimal effectiveness of the social welfare system stems from three main issues. \nFirst, social workers and social protection policymakers have limited capacity to deliver effective \nsocial welfare benefits and services. Social workers and members of local livelihood support \ncouncils, who often make decisions on program eligibility, have few opportunities for training. \nEven where training is offered, social workers have a very high caseload that makes attendance \nat training difficult, so innovative approaches are needed.9 Capacity issues also stem from the \nfact that universities are not preparing social workers and social welfare policymakers with a \nstrong educational foundation based on the latest international best practices in social policy. \n \n5.  The second main issue is that the quality of community-based social welfare services is \nuneven, and gaps exist. Mongolia is one of the few countries that has developed clear processes \nand guidance on contracting nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to deliver welfare services. \nBecause of the country\u2019s vast distances, remoteness, and limited human resources, this has been \na very important strategy to ensure coverage and access. However, many service providers are \nvery small, established only to deliver a specific service, and have limited capacity and no training \nopportunities to improve their performance. Several service areas lack good coverage by NGOs. \nThe MLSP has not developed a clear monitoring and evaluation system for community-based \nsocial welfare services. Contracted NGOs need tailored training on working with the specific \nvulnerable groups in the Social Welfare Law, and MLSP monitoring systems need strengthening. \n \n6.  The third issue is that evidence-based policy dialogue on existing and proposed social \nwelfare programs is limited. The lack of clear monitoring and evaluation systems noted above \nleads to insufficient assessment of programs and services and a limited evidence base on what \nworks and whether there might be better, more efficient or effective alternatives. Policymakers  \nhave long discussed consolidating programs and better targeting in Mongolia; however, social \nassistance can be highly politicized. This makes evidence-based policy dialogue and advocacy \naround the purpose and effectiveness of particular programs\u2014and the system as a whole\u2014very \nimportant. The government has drafted revisions to the Social Welfare Law, which Parliament is \nexpected to approve by the end of 2019. The revised law aims to (i) better coordinate social \nwelfare allowances with employment policy, (ii) better define the targeted groups for different \nprograms and differentiate benefit levels based on need, and (iii) set conditions for some of the \nallowances. The conditions include job-seeking behavior such as participation in employment-\npromotion  measures;  ensuring  that  children  are  vaccinated  and  enrolled  in  school;  and \nparticipating in training on food and nutrition, caretaking, child rights, and other areas to promote \npositive behavior change. The food stamp program targeted at the poorest Mongolians introduced \n \n9  Mongolia\u2019s historically highly professionalized social work service began to change in 2008, when the rules of \nappointment changed and bagh (subdistrict) governors were allowed to appoint local social workers. This led to de-\nprofessionalization because many people without experience or training were appointed. Capacity issues also stem \nfrom how the social workers\u2019 role has evolved to respond to the multitude of programs, many involving administration \nof cash transfers. Many social workers feel they have insufficient time to help clients more substantively. \n ", "3 \nthese conditions in 2018, but there is little evidence on whether they are effective. Sector technical \ncoordination mechanisms and evidence-based approaches to support decision making need \nstrengthening. \n \n7.  Lessons. ADB has been a leading partner in developing Mongolia\u2019s social protection \nsystem for more than 2 decades, helping to build the foundations of social assistance and social \ninsurance since the mid-1990s.10 Since then, a mix of ADB loans, grants, and TA has helped \nMongolia mitigate the adverse impacts of economic crises; strengthen the sustainability of social \nexpenditures through better targeting and consolidation of social transfers; and improve social \nprotection strategies, programs, and services, including through capacity building.11 However, \ndespite good progress, the reform agenda is evolving and far from complete\u2014continued capacity \ndevelopment  is  necessary.  A key  lesson from  the  Social  Welfare  Support  Program  is the \nimportance of providing continuous support, because reforming a sensitive area such as social \nprotection requires long-term effort and commitment.12 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: social welfare services provided to target \npopulations in an equitable and inclusive manner.13 The TA will have the following outcome: \ndelivery of social welfare benefits and services for Mongolia\u2019s poor and vulnerable improved.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Capacity of social workers and social welfare policymakers improved. \nActivities will include assessing the implications of the 2019 Social Welfare Law on social workers\u2019 \nresponsibilities and supporting dissemination through new regulations and guidelines. Building on \nan ADB-supported 2019 training needs assessment and capacity development plan for social \nworkers, the TA will develop and deliver innovative and flexible approaches to training for social \nworkers, social welfare specialists, members of livelihood support councils, and other social \nwelfare system stakeholders at central and local government levels.15 The TA will also help \ndevelop a network among universities to update and strengthen the social policy curriculum and \ndegree  programs  for  the  country\u2019s  future  social  workers  and  policymakers,  drawing  on \ninternational best practices. \n \n \n10 ADB. 2017.

Output 2: Delivery and monitoring of community-based social welfare services \nstrengthened. Activities will include assessing and strengthening policies and monitoring and \nevaluation methods for services contracted to NGOs (including community-based organizations) \nand private entities. TA experts will assist the MLSP to review the policy framework for community-\nbased social welfare services, including service standards. The TA will develop and implement \ntraining  for  service  providers  on  working  with  the  specific  groups  of  vulnerable  people  as \nestablished in the revised Social Welfare Law.16 The TA will also develop training programs and \nhelp build the capacity of NGOs and private entities that aim to become community-based service \nproviders or are already accredited and implementing services. \n \n11.  Output 3: Social welfare policy research, policy dialogue, and advocacy supported. \nActivities will include assessing the implementation, targeting, and effectiveness of the National \nProgram  on  Targeted  Household  Development  and  Protection.  Recommendations  for \nimprovement will draw on international and national lessons learned from similar programs, \nincluding the graduation approach.17 The TA will also assess at least three other programs. In \naddition, the TA will support (i) options for macro-level social assistance system development \nbased on global good practice and (ii) research to strengthen the evidence base on selected \nsocial welfare issues and debates in Mongolia\u2014such as the adequacy of benefit levels, the widely \nperceived issue of welfare dependency, the refinement of the proxy means test, or the question \nof whether welfare benefits increase the birth rate\u2014with results discussed and disseminated in a \nseries of workshops and policy briefs. The TA will work with the MLSP to strengthen public \noutreach and advocacy messages and materials on social welfare in general, the revised law, \nand any program changes. Finally, this output will establish a mechanism to continue social \nwelfare policy dialogue and coordination that comprises government, development partners, and \ncivil society. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA estimated to cost $620,000, of which $600,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff time, office accommodation, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.   The TA will be implemented from February 2020 to April 2022. The MLSP will be the \nexecuting agency, with several departments involved in implementation. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  February 2020\u2013April 2022 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Labor and Social Protection \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n \n16 The nine groups are the elderly, persons with disabilities, single parents, at-risk children, the homeless, people \nreleased from prison, drug and alcohol abusers, children with disabilities, and the poor. \n17 A.
