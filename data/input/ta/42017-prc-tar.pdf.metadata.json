INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2007 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance (TA) to \nprepare a road development project in Heilongjiang Province.1 ADB\u2019s Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited the project site in June 2008. It (i) carried out an initial poverty and social analysis (IPSA) \nand  rapid  environmental  assessment,  (ii)  held  consultation  meetings,  and  (iii)  collected \nnecessary data and information. This report is based on the understanding reached with the \nGovernment on the objective, scope, costs, financing, terms of reference, and implementation \narrangements for the TA, and the Mission\u2019s observations in the field.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Recognizing the need for rapid development of the transport sector to meet the demands \nof high economic growth, the Government of the PRC has been investing heavily in transport \ninfrastructure and services over the last 2 decades. Since 1990, the demand for passenger \ntransport has grown at an annual average rate of 7.8%, and that for freight transport at 7.6%. \nThis growth led to an increase in the modal share of roads, particularly for passenger traffic. By \n2006, road transport carried 52.8% of passenger traffic and 11.1% of freight traffic. \n \n3.  To address the major road infrastructure needs, the Government has launched several \ninitiatives\u2014the national trunk highway system (1992), the western region development plan \n(1998), and the grand plan for revitalizing the northeast region (2003). A renewed national \nexpressway  development  plan\u2014the  7918  national  expressway  network\u2014consists  of \nconstructing seven links to Beijing, nine north\u2013south corridors, and 18 east\u2013west corridors \ntotaling 85,000 kilometers (km) of expressways and high-class highways by 2020. The national \nexpressway network is expected to reach more than 1 billion people by connecting all provincial \ncapitals and large urban centers of more than 500,000 people with cities of more than 200,000 \npeople. In addition, in 2005, the Rural Roads Construction Program2 under the 11th Five-Year \nPlan 2006\u20132010 was approved to address the issues of lagging rural development and widening \nrural\u2013urban income disparities by investing CNY800 billion. The 11th Five-Year Plan aims to \nconnect all townships and villages by all-weather roads, and 90% of townships and 80% of \nvillages by paved roads. The regional targets for paved roads are to connect all townships and \nvillages in the east; 88% in central provinces; and 90% of townships and 50% of villages in the \nwest.  \n \n4.  By the end of 2006, the total road network in the PRC had grown to 3.46 million km, \nconsisting of 45,300 km of expressways, 45,300 km of class I roads, 262,700 km of class II \nroads, 354,700 km of class III roads, 1,574,800 km of class IV roads, and 1,174,100 km of \nunclassified  roads.  At  present,  100%  of  counties,  98.3%  of  townships,  and  86.4%  of \nadministrative villages are accessible by road. In 2006, Heilongjiang had a road network of \n139,335 km, of which 6.8% comprised high-class highways: 958 km of expressways, 1,325 km \nof class I highways, and 7,279 km of class II highways. Heilongjiang\u2019s road density in 2006 was \n30.7 km per 100 km2. \n \n5.  Heilongjiang is a landlocked province and has no direct access to ocean ports except by \nlong routes through other provinces or the Russian Federation. It is in the extreme north of the \nPRC and is bordered by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Inner Mongolia) on the west, \nthe Russian Federation on the north and east, and Jilin Province on the south. Its area of \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 June 2008.  \n2  The Rural Roads Construction Program includes county roads, township roads, and village roads. \n ", "2   \n \n454,000 km2 makes it the 6th largest province in the country. It has fertile land and abundant \nnatural resources. About 42% of its land is forestland, and cultivated land covers 9.2 million \nhectares, which is the largest in the country. Its population was 38.2 million in 2006 and per \ncapita gross domestic product (GDP) was CNY16,195. The province was an industrial base \nbefore  the  1980s;  its  main  sectors  are  petroleum,  coal,  power  plant  equipment,  heavy \nmachinery, steel, timber, and woodworking. The industry share of GDP is 12% for primary, 54% \nfor secondary, and 34% for tertiary industries. Foreign trade is vital to Heilongjiang\u2019s economy; \ninternational  and  domestic  demand  for  its  products  has  consistently  risen.  The  common \nboundary of Heilongjiang and the Russian Federation is 3,400 km long with 14 class I ports. In \n2007, total trade with the Russian Federation was 20% of that of the whole PRC, and the total \nvalue of goods traded comprised about 16.6% of the province\u2019s GDP. Foreign trade has grown \nby more than 15% per annum over the last 5 years.  \n \n6.  Despite its economic potential, however, Heilongjiang has been left behind by the fast- \ndeveloping coastal provinces since the 1980s. In support of the grand plan to revitalize the \nnortheast region as an industrial hub, the Ministry of Transport3 approved in 2006 the northeast \nregional transport network development plan involving three provinces.4 In line with the plan, the \nHeilongjiang Road Network Plan for 2006\u20132020 was developed by the Heilongjiang Provincial \nCommunications  Department  (HPCD)  in  2006,  with  the  aim  of  building  the  2763  network \ncomprising two rings, seven radial, six north\u2013south, and three west\u2013east high-class highways \ntotaling 13,000 km. As of the end of 2007, 16% of this plan had been achieved.  \n \n7.  The 824 km Qiangfeng Farm\u2013Nenjiang (WE2) road is one of the three key west\u2013east \ncorridors of the 2763 network and is a major route connecting the Sanjiang Plain agricultural \narea, and coal mines and wood industry in the northeast and Songnen Plain farm, pastoral area, \nand  Wudalianchi  GeoPark5  in  the  northwest.  Along  WE2  are  five  road  sections  totaling \n377.6 km, which either are in poor condition or need to be constructed. Xing\u2019an Mountain \nprevents direct travel between the northeastern and northwestern parts of the province and \nbetween Yichun and Bei\u2019an counties. To go to the northeast, goods and passengers from \ncounties in the northwest travel on the existing north\u2013south roads to Harbin or Suihua before \nmoving northeast. The long detour or lengthy travel time significantly hinders the province\u2019s \neconomic development. The remaining part of WE2 is class II concrete road in good condition.  \nAn improved Qiangfeng Farm\u2013Nenjiang corridor\u2014which eventually reaches Mongolia, an ADB \nCAREC country6\u2014will provide the shortest and important trade link between Inner Mongolia on \nthe northwest and Fuyuan port on the border with the Russian Federation in the northeast via an \nexisting 86 km class II concrete road. Fuyuan is a national land port opened in 1993 and is only \n63 km away from Khabarovsk City in the Russian Far East. Fuyuan had a trade volume of \n385,000 tons valued at CNY2.4 billion in 2006, and has potential to grow in the foreseeable \nfuture.  \n \n8.  The proposed Project (see Map) represents the fourth ADB-financed road project in \nHeilongjiang.  The  first  two  projects7  have  been  successfully  completed  while  the  third \n                                                 \n3  Formerly the Ministry of Communications.  \n4  The northeast region consists of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces. \n5  The Wudalianchi GeoPark is a national nature reserve with 14 volcanoes and 5 cold mineral spring lakes.  \n6  CAREC is an alliance of eight countries: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, People\u2019s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan and six multilateral institutions: Asian Development Bank, European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development, International Monetary Fund, Islamic Development Bank, United \nNations Development Programme, and World Bank. \n7  ADB. 2001.

Manila.   \n ", "  3\nproject8 is being implemented satisfactorily. The Project will construct 363.4 km of provincial \nexpressway or high-class highway that forms part of the Qiangfeng Farm\u2013Nenjiang corridor \n(WE2). The Project will (i) construct a 175 km access-controlled four-lane expressway\u2014the \nmissing  link  between  Yichun  and  Bei\u2019an\u2014with  a  designed  speed  of  80\u2013100  km  per  hour \ndepending on the terrain, (ii) build a 60 km expressway with a designed speed of 100 km per \nhour between Bei\u2019an and Wudulianchi along the existing class II highway, (iii) upgrade to a two-\nlane class II highway a 110 km gravel road section between Wudulianchi and Nenjiang, and \n(iv) construct a 18.4 km class I highway including a bridge across the Nen River\u2014the missing \nlink between Nenjiang and the border with Inner Mongolia. The Government has committed to \nutilize its own fund to construct a 14.2 km class I highway\u2014the remaining missing link between \nFujin and Suibin, including an extra-large bridge across the Songhua River concurrent with the \nProject. HPCD has also agreed that Heilongjiang will construct a bridge across Nen River under \nthe Project while Inner Mongolia will build a 146 km class I road from Nen Bridge to Jiagedaqi \nCity in Inner Mongolia using its own funds at the same time as the Project.   \n \n9.  The project road will connect to the one vertical line, two radial lines of the 2763 network \nthat is vital to Heilongjiang and the northeast region as it will enhance Heilongjiang\u2019s road \nnetwork efficiency. The Project will establish resource-efficient transport. The travel distance \nfrom Yichun to Nenjiang will be shorter by about 200 km and the time reduced by 6 hours. At \npresent, there is no road between Yichun and Bei\u2019an; thus passenger and freight traffic travel on \nthe north\u2013south Yichun\u2013Suihua and Bei\u2019an\u2013Suihua roads, making up a traffic volume of 4,658 \nand  5,377  vehicles  per  day,  respectively.  The  existing  class  II  road  between  Bei\u2019an  and \nWudulianchi had a traffic volume of 6,719 vehicles per day in 2007 which had grown at more \nthan 11% annually in the past 5 years. Wudulianchi GeoPark has high potential for tourism \ndevelopment; it received 0.7 million tourists in 2007. Overall, traffic in the project roads will grow \nby 9%\u201310% during 2011\u20132020 and by 6%\u20137% during 2021\u20132030. Road safety is a serious \nissue in Heilongjiang, particularly during the winter season\u201440% of accidents (3,021 from a \ntotal of 7,552) is due to ice and snow on roads because of inadequate snow clearance during \nharsh winters. The project road is expected to (i) increase the transport capacity on WE2, \n(ii) substantially reduce fuel consumption and vehicle emissions, and (iii) improve the efficiency \nand safety of the road network in Heilongjiang, thus playing a critical role in catalyzing economic \ngrowth, spurring interprovincial and regional trade, and reducing poverty in the project area.  \n \n10.  The project area covers Yichun, Bei\u2019an, Wudulianchi, and Nenjiang counties or cities in \nHeihe Prefecture in the remote northwestern part of Heilongjiang, and has a population of \n1.43 million, of which 53% is rural. In 2006, the rural per capita income was CNY3,475. The per \ncapita GDP in the area was CNY8,223, which is 49% of the provincial average of CNY16,195, \nand 52% of the national average. The project area has numerous poverty villages; the rural \npoverty incidence is about 8%. Long distances and poor transport conditions limit the mobility of \npeople in the project area. The Project will substantially improve transport infrastructure and \nservice, and will improve access to larger markets and higher quality social services. The main \nethnic groups in the project area include Manchu, Korean, and Hui. There are no minority \ntownships along the alignment, but there are about eight minority villages. The villages have \nmainly Han people; only about 20% are ethnic minorities.  \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s operational strategy9 in the road subsector supports (i) construction of roads that \nconnect major growth centers supported by a system of local roads; (ii) development and \nimprovement of urban transport and rural roads; (iii) promotion of road safety, reduction of \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006.

The proposed Project is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development \npriorities in the central and western parts of the country and in the old industrial areas in the \nnortheast, and ADB\u2019s strategy for the transport sector, which focuses on assistance to the less \ndeveloped inland provinces where the majority of the poor live. The ADB Operations Evaluation \nDepartment evaluated the sector assistance program in 2007 and examined the performance of \nADB\u2019s assistance in developing roads and railways in the PRC. The assessment concluded that \nADB\u2019s support for the road sector during 1997\u20132005 was successful, and suggested giving \nmore  attention  to  identifying  value  addition  and  enhancing  the  performance  of  technical \nassistance for future road projects to be financed by ADB. Such recommendations are being \ntaken into account in preparing the Project.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA will help HPCD develop a more efficient, safe, and environmentally sustainable \nroad transport in the project area. The outcome will be a project suitable for ADB financing that \nthe Government will agree to. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The initial poverty and social analysis (IPSA) carried out during fact-finding examined \npoverty conditions, minority issues, resettlement effects, gender issues and vulnerable groups \n(Appendix 2). It found that the key social issues to be addressed during project preparation are \npoverty  impact,  resettlement  effects,  and  related  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities.  The  IPSA \nconcluded that the Project should be in involuntary resettlement category A, while the presence \nof indigenous people puts it in category B, which may require a full resettlement plan and a \nsocial development action plan. The TA will assist HPCD in (i) upgrading the feasibility study \nincluding an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and summary EIA, and a resettlement plan \nto ensure that the Project conforms to ADB requirements; (ii) conducting detailed social impact \nanalysis, investigating opportunities to provide more immediate and direct benefits to poor \npeople, and incorporating viable options into the Project either as a component or in a social \ndevelopment action plan embracing ethnic minorities to enhance their benefits from the Project; \n(iii)  designing  the  project  framework,  identifying  performance  targets  and  indicators  for \nmonitoring  socioeconomic  impact,  and  establishing  baseline  values  and  measuring  or \nmonitoring mechanisms; (iv) confirming the technical, economic, and financial viability of the \nproposed investment; (v) updating transport demand with due consideration of transport modes \nwith low energy consumption and low emission, and producing  a  short  policy  note  for  the \ndevelopment of environment-friendly transport mode; (vi) reviewing the road sector issues and \nproviding the basis for strengthening the ongoing policy dialogue with the Government in key \nareas, focusing on management of rural road maintenance, rural transport services, regional \ncooperation,  and  interprovincial  connectivity;  (vii)  exploring  ways  of  how  the  project  can \ncomplement the activities under the Heilongjiang Road Network Development Project in road \nsafety, vehicle overloading, vehicle emissions, and private sector participation in the road sector \n(footnote 8); (viii) conducting stakeholder analysis and preparing a consultation and participation \nplan; and (ix) assessing the procurement capacity of HPCD and preparing a draft procurement \nplan for the contract packages that will be needed under the Project.  \n \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, of which the Government has requested ADB \nfinancing of $600,000 (Appendix 3). ADB will finance the TA with a grant from ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The Government will finance the balance equivalent to $100,000 in kind by providing \ncounterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  local  transport,  and  other  support  services  required  in \nimplementing the TA. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will require 35.5 person-months of consulting services (11.5 international and 24 \nnational) spread over 4 months, to carry out the work as defined in the terms of reference \n(Appendix  4).  ADB  will  engage  a  consulting  firm  using  the  simplified  technical  proposal \nprocedures and quality- and cost-based selection method based on the quality\u2013cost ratio of \n80:20 in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The international consultants will have expertise in (i) highway engineering and \nroad  maintenance  management,  (ii)  transport  economics  and  rural  transport  services, \n(iii) financial analysis and expressway operations, (iv) regional development, (v) social and \npoverty analysis, and (vi) environment assessment. Expertise required for national consultants \nwill be in (i) civil works and soil engineering; (ii) transport economics; (iii) financial analysis and \nexpressway operations; (iv) regional development and trade facilitation; (v) poverty, social and \ngender  analysis;  (vi) environmental  assessment;  (vii)  resettlement  planning;  (viii)  transport \nservice; and (ix) contract packaging and procurement planning. \n  \n16.  HPCD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  In  March  2008,  HPCD  established  a  project \nmanagement office with six staff members to coordinate and supervise TA activities, including \n(i) monitoring progress, (ii) resolving issues that arise during implementation, (iii) assisting in \narranging meetings and workshops, and (iv) liaising with various government agencies and \norganizations.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  ensure  coordination  among  the  National \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission,  Ministry  of  Transport,  Ministry  of  Environmental \nProtection, Ministry of Land and Resources, HPCD, and other government agencies relevant to \nthe TA. HPCD will provide ADB and the consultants with the feasibility study; engineering \nstudies; EIA; resettlement plan; and all other materials, recent studies, and reports required to \nimplement the TA. Tripartite meetings involving the Government, ADB, and the consultants will \nbe held in the PRC to review the consultants\u2019 inception and draft final reports. The consultants \nwill procure computer hardware and/or software, photocopier, facsimile machine, and other \noffice  equipment  that  they  need  under  the  TA  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement (2007, as amended from time to time), and will turn them over to HPCD after \ncompletion of the TA. The consultants are expected to be fielded in February 2009; their work \nwill be carried out over 4 months and be completed in July 2009 with the submission of the final \nreport after comments received from ADB and HPCD in June 2009 have been incorporated. The \nconsultants\u2019 final report will be posted on ADB\u2019s website upon TA completion.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  preparing  the  Heilongjiang  Road \nDevelopment II Project (Yichun\u2013Nenjiang), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign   Performance  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact  Assumptions \nA more efficient,  Traffic volume on the project road  Traffic counts and  \u2022 Assumed traffic \nsafe, and  increases by 9%\u201310% during  travel time survey by  growth \nenvironmentally  2011\u20132020 and by   HPCD.  materializes. \nsustainable road  6%\u20137% during 2021\u20132030.    \ntransport in the     \nproject area  Travel distance is shortened by   \nprovided by  about 200 km.    \nHeilongjiang     \nProvincial  Travel time between Yichun and   \nCommunications  Nenjiang is reduced by 6 hours.    \nDepartment (HPCD).     \n\u2022 An effective traffic \nRoad accidents and fatalities in  Traffic accident \nenforcement and \nthe project area are reduced  reports published by \npublic awareness \nannually by 10%.  the Heilongjiang \ncampaign promote \nProvincial Public \nroad safety. \nSecurity Bureau. \nOutcome  Assumptions \nProject design  Memorandum of understanding is  Memorandum of  \u2022 The Government is \nagreed upon by the  signed by the Government and  understanding  willing to adopt \nGovernment and  ADB during the final technical  recommendations \nAsian Development  assistance (TA) tripartite meeting  of the TA. \nBank (ADB).  in June 2009.  \u2022 The Government \nobtains necessary \nsources of funding. \nOutputs  Assumption \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy \nof the partner country. \n \nThe  transport  sector  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  directly  through  improved  access  to  markets,  employment \nopportunities, and social services; and indirectly by facilitating economic development. The project area is in the remote \nnorthern part of Heilongjiang, and will complete the highway network that has been partially financed by previous Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) highway projects. The proposed project will reduce the time and cost of travel from west to east, \nthereby help speed up economic development, job creation, and improved access to larger markets and higher quality \nsocial services. \n \nB.    Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe construction of the Yichun\u2013Nenjiang highway  will have indirect impacts on poverty reduction. The Project will \nsubstantially improve transport infrastructure and service and will facilitate economic development that will provide more \nemployment and income-generating opportunities for local people. The Project will also improve access to markets and \nsocial services for the county centers and towns. Rural poverty incidence in the project area is about 8%.  \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nThe Project could directly contribute to poverty reduction in the project area by generating short-term employment \nopportunities in construction, and indirectly through faster economic growth from farming and tourism in the long term. A \ndetailed poverty and social analysis will assess poverty incidence in the project area, investigate opportunities to provide \nmore immediate and direct benefits to poor people, and incorporate viable options into the Project either as a component or \nin a social development action plan (SDAP) including ethnic minorities to enhance their benefits from the Project. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.    Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \nThe primary beneficiaries include local government, transport companies, state farms, state forest farms, local businesses, \nand local residents. The 20,000\u201330,000 poor in 50\u2013100 poverty villages will benefit from the proposed Project (better \nestimates will be made during the PPTA). There are already good roads or planned improvements for local road access to \nvillages; therefore, the poverty villages will benefit equally from the highway project. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nThe beneficiaries require improved transport infrastructure and services to enable goods and people to reach distant \ncenters faster and safely. The current road network does not permit convenient east\u2013west movements. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \nThere are no major constraints. The north\u2013south roads are good, but the east\u2013west roads are very limited. Local people \nhave access to major rural roads and vehicles; however, rural transport services are inadequate. The Project will provide \n(i) improved transport infrastructure to give access to better employment opportunities, larger markets, and higher quality \nsocial services; and (ii) reliable and convenient bus service.   \n \n \nB.    Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nMajor stakeholders include Heilongjiang Provincial Communications Department, local governments, transport companies, \nstate farms, state forest farms, local businesses, and local residents. \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nStakeholders will be consulted during the preparation of the feasibility study report, environmental impact assessment and \ndraft resettlement plan. The ADB PPTA Fact-Finding Mission held initial stakeholder consultation in the affected counties. \nFurther consultation will be carried out for the environmental impact assessment, resettlement planning, and poverty and \nsocial analysis during the PPTA phase. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nLocal people will (i) be consulted during the feasibility study, PPTA implementation, and preliminary design to fix the \nexpressway alignment; (ii) participate in preparing and implementing village-level rehabilitation plans and SDAP if there is \none, and (iii) be hired for construction of the project highway. \n \nC.    Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or program? \n \nThere are no major gender issues in the project area. Women have no problems concerning access to services. The PPTA \nwill investigate opportunities to further enhance the benefits to women (e.g., improved public transport service and local \nroad improvements that lead to better access to education, health care, and markets). The resettlement plan and possible \nSDAP will include special measures to mitigate adverse impacts and improve conditions for women, especially improved \naccess to education, health facilities, and employment. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?       Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nDuring the PPTA, all potential measures will be identified through consultation and participation, and a project component or \na SDAP will be prepared to address special measures to improve conditions of women. \n \n3.  Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nThe Project will cause adverse impacts due to (i) land acquisition and resettlement, which will be addressed in the \nresettlement plan; and (ii) increased risk of communicable diseases, which will be addressed in the SDAP if required. \nLivelihood opportunities and training requirements will be included in the resettlement plan. \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \nIII.
