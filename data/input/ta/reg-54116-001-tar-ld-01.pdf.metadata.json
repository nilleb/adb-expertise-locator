Background \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank, under the Knowledge and Support Technical Assistance \nfor Challenges and Opportunities of Population Aging in Asia: Improving Data and Analysis for \nHealthy and Productive Aging, invites firms and research institutions with prior experience in \nsurveys to submit proposals to conduct a survey on the characteristics of aging population in \ntargeted ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs). The survey is expected to provide quality \ndatasets on the economic, social, and health status of older persons for targeted DMCs.  Survey \nresults  will  be  utilized  in  producing  innovative  research  and  assessments  on  healthy  and \nproductive aging.  \n \nB.    Objectives  \n  \n2.  The ultimate objective of the survey is to increase knowledge and understanding of the \naging population profile for targeted DMCs through quality data to help governments monitor \naging-related developments and thus make informed decision when reforming health and social \nsecurity systems and crafting broader policies to adapt to population aging. \n  \n3.  The survey should be able to:   \na.  Collect data on the demographic, economic, social and health status of older persons. \nb.  Identify their existing needs, the extent of social protection coverage, and other policy \nrelevant attributes.  \nc.  Identify constraints and gaps in the provision of health and social services to the \nelderly population. \nd.  Be able to be used to summarize findings on demographic profile of the aging \npopulation in the society. \n  \nC.        Scope of Work and Detailed Tasks  \n  \n4.  The tasks expected of the survey firm are as follows:   \na.  Have a questionnaire which is designed to identify statistically the critical information \non the aging profile of the target DMCs.  It will be comprised of both quantitative and \nqualitative  questions.  The  questionnaire  will  be  pre-tested  and  finalized  in \ncollaboration with ADB and may draw on existing HRS family surveys.1  \nb.
