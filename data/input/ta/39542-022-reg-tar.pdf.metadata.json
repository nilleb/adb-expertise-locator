INTRODUCTION \n1.  The new Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program Strategic \nFramework 2012\u20132022, endorsed at the GMS Summit in Myanmar in December 2011, calls for \nagriculture to be a key priority sector in transforming the transport corridors into economic \ncorridors. Intra-regional trade in agri-food products is one of the fastest-growing trade sectors, \nand further expansion of agri-food trade can have potentially large growth and spillover effects, \nand  enhance  regional  competitiveness.  Under  the  GMS  program,  regional  cooperation  in \nagriculture is guided by the Core Agriculture Support Program (CASP) implemented by the \nGMS Working Group on Agriculture (WGA), supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand other development partners. CASP phase 1 (CASP 1), implemented during 2006\u20132010, \nsuccessfully enhanced human and institutional capacity on regional food security, cross-border \ntrade, and rural renewable energy. In addition, information sharing was developed under the \nGMS Agricultural Information Network Service (GMS AINS). Building upon lessons from CASP \n1, CASP phase 2 (CASP 2, 2011\u20132015) was endorsed at the 16th GMS Ministerial Meeting in \nViet  Nam  in  August  2010.  GMS  countries  requested  support  from  ADB  to  support \nimplementation of CASP 2. This technical assistance (TA) concept paper was presented and \nendorsed by the GMS countries at the Eighth WGA Annual Meeting held in Cambodia in \nOctober 2011. Fact-finding missions visited GMS countries from January to April 2012 to further \nconsult and agree on the scope and implementation arrangements. The TA is included in the \nGMS  Regional  Cooperation  Operations  Business  Plan  (2012\u20132014). 1  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Food  and  energy  security,  particularly  for  the  poor,  has  become  one  of  the  most \nimportant issues in development dialogues. Food prices reached a new historic peak in January \n2011 and an estimated 44 million people in developing countries fell below the extreme poverty \nline of $1.25 per day in the second-half of 2010.3 In times of food insecurity, women are often \nlikely to receive less food because of gender-bias distribution dynamics within households. \nMultiple factors drive rising prices, including reduced production due to climatic extremes, high \noil  prices,  and  speculation.  Moreover,  inappropriate  agricultural  practices  and  overuse  of \nagrochemicals degrade soil, water, and biodiversity, raising concerns regarding food safety and \nthe negative implications for health, for both producers and consumers. The increasing financial, \nenvironmental,  and  health  costs  of  current  agricultural  practices  indicate  that  alternative \nstrategies are required. The majority of the rural population also lacks energy security; their \nenergy  needs  are  currently  fulfilled  by  fuel  wood,  which  generates  black  carbon  and  is \ndetrimental to health. Improved access to clean energy for the poor is essential for inclusive and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. \n \n3.  Globally, agriculture contributes over 31% of greenhouse gases (GHGs), making it the \nsecond largest emitter; of this about 14% is from production and 17% from land use change and \nburning of biomass. Intensive agriculture is particularly damaging as it is the largest emitter of (i) \nnitrous oxide, which has 289 times the heat-trapping ability of carbon dioxide (CO ); and (ii) \n2\nmethane, with a heat trapping ability 23 times greater than CO .4 By introducing climate-friendly \n2\nagricultural  practices  to  sequester  carbon  in  soil,  agriculture  can  potentially  reduce  GHG \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2011.

", "2 \n \nemissions by about 5.5 gigatons (Gt)5 of CO annually.6 Increasing soil carbon contributes to soil \n2 \nfertility (and thus productivity), and improves the resilience of farming systems to flood and \ndrought. In terms of potential carbon storage, the global soil carbon reservoir at 2,500 Gt CO  \n2\nequivalent, is 3.3 times larger than the atmospheric reservoir (760 Gt CO  equivalent) and 4.5 \n2\ntimes larger than the biotic reservoir (560 Gt CO  equivalent).7 Climate-friendly agriculture\u2014\n2\nwhich has the potential to offer farmers the triple wins of higher yields, increased climate \nresilience and reduced GHG emissions\u2014should be promoted, to involve the poor to be part of \nsolution for climate change while simultaneously enhancing their food and energy security.   \n \n4.  Over  60%  of  the  326  million  inhabitants  of  the  GMS8 are  engaged  in  small-scale \nagriculture, and enhancing productivity while restoring and safeguarding the natural ecosystems \nthat  underpin  agricultural  production  is  a  high  priority.  The  GMS  countries  recognize  that \nagriculture  offers  the  best  possible  climate  mitigation  and  adaptation  potential,  and  their \nconcerted,  regional  approach  is  necessary  to  effectively  address  the  short  and  long-term \nconstraints to developing a competitive agriculture sector. Calls for the agricultural sector to \nenhance  quality  and  safety  while  improving  social  and  environmental  performance  are \nincreasing  in  both  domestic,  regional,  and  international  markets,  and  this  creates  special \nchallenges for smallholder farmers, particularly the women who account for more than 70% of \nhousehold food production. To address the disproportionate burden borne by women, support \nfor  innovative  gender-responsive  private  sector  financing  mechanisms  to  improve  market \naccess by smallholders is required. A key strategy for developing \u2015green\u2016, inclusive value chains \nis to link smallholders who practice environmentally friendly methods into modern value chains. \nIn addition to addressing gaps in hard and soft infrastructure at the regional level, the use of \ninformation and communication technology (ICT)9\u2014to reduce the transaction costs of working \nwith the poor and trade-related documentation costs\u2014will be promoted to build an inclusive and \ncompetitive  agriculture  sector.  These  activities  are  essential  to  enhance  cross-border  food \ngovernance while fostering greater economic integration and leveraging growth dynamics and \nspillover effects along the GMS transport corridors.  \n \n5.  Several regional initiatives under CASP 1 (2006\u20132010)10 were successfully implemented, \nincluding promotion of cross-border contract farming, biosafety, and trade facilitation. These \nactivities contributed to increases in intra-regional trade, from $12.2 billion in 2000 to $96.9 \nbillion in 2010,11 including an increase in agri-food exports, from $2 billion in 2000 to over $13 \nbillion in 2010.12 Agri-food trade is still largely informal, and further support to formalize cross-\nborder trade of environmentally friendly agri-food products of smallholders will enhance public \nrevenues, as well as restore the functioning of ecosystems.  \n \n                                                \n5 1 gigaton is equal to 1 billion metric tons.  \n6  I.

The key lessons stemming from CASP 1 implementation include the need for further \nstrengthening of WGA institutional capacity for regional cooperation. Several new issues also \nemerged: (i) global concerns regarding the impact of climate change on food security and safety, \n(ii) the energy costs and competitiveness of GMS agri-food products, and (iii) the rise of ethical \nconsumerism among the general public. The vision statement of CASP 2 takes these issues \ninto account: \u2015calling for the GMS to be recognized as the leading producer of safe food, using \nclimate-friendly agricultural practices, and is integrated into global markets through regional \neconomic corridors.\u201d13 CASP 1 was regarded as overly ambitious\u2014of the 35 proposed projects, \nwhich covered a wide range of agriculture subsectors, only 13 projects were implemented\u2014and \nCASP 2 has adopted a more focused approach guided by three strategic pillars: (i) pillar 1 \nseeks to build global competitiveness by promoting food safety and modernizing agricultural \ntrade through the introduction of ICT and harmonized certification systems; (ii) pillar 2 promotes \nclimate-friendly  agriculture  through  a  market-based  strategy  to  ensure  food  security,  while \nrewarding farmers for their ecosystem services; and (iii) pillar 3 promotes agriculture as a leader \nin providing clean renewable rural energy through efficient use of biomass for bioenergy, while \nensuring  food  security.  Ongoing  regional  TA  is  providing  initial  funding  for  pillar  3  on \nbioenergy,14 while  this  TA  will  initiate  selected  strategic  activities  under  CASP  2,  and  will \ninstitutionally strengthen the WGA to mobilize additional funds to realize the CASP 2 vision. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be a more integrated, climate-friendly agricultural sector in the GMS. The \noutcome is enhanced market access for environmentally friendly agricultural products produced \nby smallholders.  \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will focus on enhancing existing and emerging value chains for environmentally  \nfriendly production by smallholders. The TA will also strengthen the institutional capacity of the \nWGA for regional cooperation. The TA has five outputs.  \n9.  Output  1:  Strengthened  regional  policy  framework  and  capacity  for  agri-food \nquality management. Regional standards, food labeling systems along with mutual recognition \nof  certification  systems,  including  community-based  certifications  such  as  the  participatory \nguarantee system will be promoted. The use of ICT and modern value chain management \nsystems, such as farm assurance and regional traceability systems,15 will be supported through \npilot activities to extract lessons for wider implementation.  \n \n10.  Output  2:  Established  electronic  trade  of  environmentally  friendly  agri-food \nproduction  of  smallholders.  Market  studies  on  eco-friendly  agri-produce,  as  well  as  on \nconsumer perception and access to safe agri-food products, will be conducted at the start and \nend  of  the  project.16 A  road  map  for  e-trade  operations,  including  a  cross-border  trade \nadministration system for agri-food products and e-trade modalities, will be piloted. Participation \nof producers in regional and international trade fairs will also be supported.  \n \n                                                \n \n13 ADB. 2011.

Output  3:  Increased  adoption  of  gender-responsive  and  climate-friendly \nagriculture. Innovative mechanisms for carbon financing, efficient use of water, and other \nenvironmentally friendly practices will be promoted through collaboration with the private sector \nand civil society organizations. Multimedia products targeting illiterate female farmers will be \ndeveloped  and  disseminated.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  pilot  projects,17 studies  will  be \nundertaken on expansion of the projects as a regional investment.  \n \n12.  Output 4: Facilitated knowledge management and dissemination. Relevant regional \nstudies will be conducted to facilitate regional planning. Knowledge products based on ongoing \nand  past  GMS  regional  TA  projects  will  be  produced  and  disseminated  through  regional \nplatforms, including GMS AINS websites in respective countries and through mass media.  \n13.  Output 5: Strengthened regional cooperation on agriculture in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion. The capacity of the WGA secretariat will be enhanced through the establishment of \na national secretariat support unit in each GMS country.18 Use of a results-based framework,19 \nas well as standard operating procedures for the WGA, will be institutionalized. WGA annual \nmeetings will be organized and support solicited for full implementation of CASP 2.  \nC.   Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $7,500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by the Government of Sweden (SKr53 million, or about $7.5 million equivalent), \nand administered by ADB. Governments from the GMS countries will provide 20% of the total \ncost as an in-kind contribution.20 The scale of activities and duration of the TA will be revised to \ncover  the  full  scope  of  CASP  2  as  additional  cofinancing  becomes  available.21 The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented from 15 September 2012 until 14 September 2017.22 ADB \nwill  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  with  the  Environment,  Natural  Resources  and \nAgriculture Division of the Southeast Asia Department serving as the focal point. The TA office, \nwhere the WGA secretariat will be based, will be housed at the GMS Environmental Operations \nCenter (EOC) in Bangkok.23 The WGA secretariat will comprise the WGA manager, working \nclosely with national secretariat specialists based in the GMS countries; they will be supported \nby a team of consultants who will provide technical and administrative support in implementing \nTA activities under the supervision of a designated ADB project officer. The WGA NSSUs,24 \nunder the agriculture ministries of the GMS countries, will be the main implementing agencies, \n                                                \n17 These include financial and economic analysis and scalability as public\u2013private partnership projects. \n18 The TA builds capacities of government officials and thus reinforces the sustainability of the WGA secretariat.  \n19 Baseline indicators will be gender disaggregated, to the extent possible.   \n20 GMS countries will provide in-kind contributions in the form of staff to implement, coordinate, and monitor TA \nactivities; as well as data, review of translation, support facilities, utilities, and office space with furniture. There is \nno country-specific support for Myanmar in the TA. \n21 The program framework period of CASP 2 was extended from 2015 to 2020 as agreed at the 9th Annual WGA \nmeeting in July 2012 in Nanning, the People\u2019s Republic of China. The list of projects to support CASP 2 will be \nupdated regularly.  \n22 This is subject to \u2015no-objection\u2016 from the GMS countries. All financial disbursements of Swedish International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency funds will be completed by December 2016.  \n23 Established by ADB, the EOC is ideally placed to support TA implementation owing to its ongoing engagements \nwith GMS counterparts on environment, energy, and tourism. \n24 The NSSUs will be based at respective implementing agencies in each GMS country. Each NSSU has a national \nsecretariat specialist (NSS), a WGA national focal person or government counterpart, and contact persons in \nrelevant agencies or ministries. Only the NSSs are TA-funded.  \n ", "5 \n \nwith the Foreign Economic Cooperation Center of the Ministry of Agriculture of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China responsible for the AINS platform. Overall guidance for TA implementation \nwill be provided by the WGA annual meetings, attended by the WGA coordinators of GMS \ncountries and key development partners. Implementation arrangements and further information \non the TA are available on request as supplementary appendixes.  \n \n16.  Consistent with the implementation arrangements established under the EOC, ADB will \nengage  the  services  of  international  consultants  (up  to  115  person-months)  and  national \nconsultants (up to 557 person-months).25 Following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time), consultants will be engaged as individuals, mainly to \nsupport  the  WGA  secretariat,  and/or  firms  or  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  to \nimplement  selected  activities.26 Consultants  and/or  firms  or  NGOs  with  highly  specialized \nexpertise\u2014particularly those engaged in ongoing and past projects supporting CASP\u2014will be \nrecruited through consultants\u2019 qualifications selection. Administrative staff will be contracted by \nthe WGA secretariat. The TA will also be implemented through letters of agreement between \nADB and, as appropriate, line agencies, NGOs, and academic or research institutions acting as \nimplementing agencies for the TA. Advance contracting of consultants is requested to ensure \ncontinuity of CASP 2 activities. The consultants will assist in: (i) developing road maps and \nimplementing CASP 2 by conducting studies and pilot projects to scale up regional investments \nconsistent with GMS master plan, (ii) mobilizing resources from private sector and development \npartners to support CASP; and (iii) enhancing institutional capacity for regional cooperation and \nenhancing collaboration with other GMS working groups and development partners.  \n \n17.  Disbursements under the TA will conform to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  advance  payment  facility  will  be \nestablished to disburse funds to national implementing agencies and partners, including WGA \nNSSUs,  to  cover  operating  costs  and  to  be  replenished  on  submission  of  a  summary  of \nexpenditures. Implementing agencies and partners will be required to maintain project accounts \nand  be  audited  periodically.  All  procurement  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). All equipment procured will be \nhanded over to the implementing agencies upon completion of the TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n18.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $7,500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment  of  Sweden  for  Implementing  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Core  Agriculture \nSupport Program (Phase 2). \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n                                                \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n25 Excluding person-months for the administrative staff. \n26 The selection method will be determined based on the terms of reference, in consultation with ADB\u2019s Central   \nOperations Services Office. \n ", "6   Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets \nData Sources and \nDesign Summary  and Indicators with  Assumptions and Risks \nReporting Mechanisms \nBaselinesa \nImpact  By 2020, compared to  Progress reports and  Assumptions \nA more integrated,  the 2012 baseline:  annual reports from  GMS countries remain \nclimate friendly    GMS agriculture and  committed to regional \nagricultural sector  50% increase in cross- related ministries   integration  \nin the GMS  border trade of SPS-    \nsensitive products  Annual national and/or  Private and public sector \n  international trade  investments are available \n50% increase in GMS  statistics   \nagri-food exports to trade    Risks \nblocs  Increasing protectionism \nin main export markets  \n \nExtraordinary climatic \nevents \nOutcome  By 2017, compared to  Survey at the end of the  Assumption \nEnhanced market  the 2012 baseline:  project  Development partners and \naccess for      private sector use \nenvironmentally  30% increase in the  Statistics of certification  developed frameworks \nfriendly agricultural  number of farms (at least  bodies in the GMS  and knowledge products \nproducts produced  10% of which are     \nby smallholders  managed by women)  Progress and final  Risk \n  linked to value chains  reports   Government policies and \nbased on environmentally  frameworks are not \nfriendly production  conducive to gender-\nresponsive, climate-\nfriendly agriculture \n \nOutputs  By 2017b:    Assumptions \n1.
