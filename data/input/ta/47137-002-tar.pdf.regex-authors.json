The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has requested \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA)from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help \n \nimplement health sector reforms.1The request, made through the Ministry of Health (MOH), \n \nasked that the TA focus on strengthening governance systems; enhancing access to health \nservices, particularly in rural and remote areas; and improving the quality of these services. The \nTA will also help identify options for ADB\u2019s future engagement in the sector. The TA is included \nin ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for the Lao PDR.2 During 22\u201325 October \n2013  fact-finding  mission,  the  government  and  ADB  agreed  on  the  TA  impact,  outcome, \nimplementation arrangements, costs and financing, and terms of reference. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Poverty and inequality. The economy of the Lao PDR grew at a rapid annual pace of \n7.7% during 2006\u20132012. Its gross domestic product per capita increased from $335 in 2000 to \n$1,400 in 2012, and the poverty rate dropped from 39% in 1998 to 27% in 2008. Nonetheless, \nincome disparities between the rich and poor and between rural and urban areas are widening. \nThe poverty level was 31.7% in the rural parts of the country in 2008, compared with 17.4% in \nurban regions.3 Ethnic minorities are particularly affected. They comprise almost one-half of the \npopulation and live mainly in the highlands, where the poor are concentrated and access to \nbasic services and health outcomes are worse than in the rest of the country.  \n \n3.  Lagging  health  indicators.  The  Lao  PDR  has  aligned  its  national  development \npriorities  with  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  Despite  steady \nimprovement, progress on the MDG health indicators has lagged behind that of other countries \nin Southeast Asia. The maternal mortality ratio is still high\u2014357 maternal deaths per 100,000 \nlive births (MDG target: 260 per 100,000). The prevalence of stunted children under 5 years of \nage is 44%, compared with the MDG target of 34%.4 The full immunization coverage rate is a \nlow 32%. Only 54% of women receive prenatal care, and only 42% have skilled assistance at \nthe birth of their children.5 These indicators are lower for the poor and ethnic minorities (footnote \n4).   \n \n4.  Financing health care. Although financing in the sector has increased since 2009, it is \nstill substantially lower than in most other Southeast Asian countries.6 In 2011, out of pocket \npayments  account for 40%  of total  health  expenditures,  and  external  resources for  health \naccount  for  23%  of  total  health  expenditures.7 Nonwage  recurrent  expenditures  by  the \ngovernment are only 17% of the total government health expenditures, which impedes effective \nservice delivery and operations and maintenance. The lack of health spending is even more \nperceptible at the provincial and district levels, even though they are mandated to deliver health \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 November 2013.   \n2  ADB. 2013.

Vientiane. \n4  United Nations Development Programme. 2013. Millennium Development Goals Report.  Vientiane. \n5  Lao Statistic Bureau. 2012. Lao Social Indicator Survey. Vientiane.  \n6  In 2011, total health expenditure per capita was $37 in the Lao PDR, $51 in Cambodia, $22 in Myanmar, $97 in the \nPhilippines, and $96 in Viet Nam.  \n7  World Health Organization. Global Health Expenditures Database. \nhttp://apps.who.int/nha/database/DataExplorerRegime.aspx (accessed 26 November 2013). External resources for \nhealth are funds or in-kind services that are provided by entities not part of the country in question. \n ", "2   \nservices to address the MDGs.8 The quality of the health care being provided is also a concern. \nHealth facilities lack medicine, basic equipment, and buildings, particularly in poor and remote \nareas.9  \n \n5.  Health  sector  planning  and  budgeting.  Low  recurrent  spending\u2014particularly  low \nnonwage spending\u2014is a major constraint on the development of the health sector. Planning \nand  budgeting  systems  need  strengthening  to  allocate  resources  more  efficiently.  Budget \nexecution  by  provincial  governments  is  weak,  and  cash  flow  problems  are  encountered. \nProvincial spending is also vulnerable to political pressures and is not necessarily allocated in \nline with the national priorities. To pay for their basic operations and maintenance, district \nhospitals and health centers rely largely on small off-budget margins from the sale of medicines \n(through the drug revolving fund).  \n \n6.  The  country\u2019s  major  health  programs  are  managed  centrally  and  not  integrated  in \nprovincial  budgets.  Official  development  assistance  is  channeled  through  separate \nmechanisms.  This  fragmentation  of  responsibilities  prevents  effective  coordination  with \nmainstream health service delivery at health facilities and undermines the authority of the \nprovincial and district health officials responsible for delivering grassroots services. Financial \nmanagement in hospitals and health centers lacks transparency and accountability. Significant \nsources of revenue, such as drug revolving funds and users\u2019 fees, are not included in the \nbudgets of these health facilities. Budgets are mainly input-driven, and flexibility in allocating \nresources is restrained by the overall funding limitations. \n \n7.  Health human resources. The sector\u2019s performance also suffers from a shortage of \nqualified health workers, low staff productivity, a mismatch between the staffing structure and \nactual demand, inappropriate skill mixes, low salaries, and the absence of incentives for staff to \nwork in remote areas. The number of health workers per capita has remained unchanged at 1.8 \nper 1,000 people since 2005. Only 53% of health employees have been assigned to the districts \nwhere they are needed most.10 The sector lacks qualified female workers, and more members \nof the country\u2019s ethnic minorities need to be trained to strengthen the health workforce in rural \nand remote areas. The government is implementing licensing for nurses and midwives, but the \ncountry still does not have a licensing system for medical doctors. Pre-service training of health \nworkers also needs strengthening. Many educational and training institutions lack qualified \nteachers, provide poor skills training, and charge high fees. Registration and regulation systems \nfor training institutions are still underdeveloped.   \n \n8.  Private provider regulatory framework. The Lao PDR has many private pharmacies \nand clinics in urban areas, but few private hospitals, mainly in big cities. Responses to the \ngrowing demand for high quality, technology-intensive medical services may include private \nsector participation and the outsourcing of certain services. However, the government would \nneed to facilitate private sector investments and improve its licensing and regulatory framework \nin order to mitigate negative externalities and ensure good quality health care services. Options \nfor engaging civil society organizations in the financing and delivery of health services should \nalso need to be explored.  \n                                                \n8  ADB.  2009.

Vientiane. \n ", "    3 \n9.  Government strategy. The government has introduced policies and strategies since \n2000 to guide health sector reforms aimed at achieving the MDGs, improving health financing \nand  systems,  setting  standards,  and  strengthening  coordination  within  the  sector.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  Seventh  National  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015  reflects  its \ncommitment to improve human development outcomes. The National Health Sector Reform \nStrategy, 2013\u20132025 aims to achieve the MDGs by 2015, increase access to basic services by \n2020, and provide universal coverage by 2025. Its five priority areas are (i) human resource \ndevelopment; (ii) health financing; (iii) organization, management, and planning; (iv) services \ndelivery,  with  emphasis  on  maternal  and  child  care;  and  (v)  information,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation. To date, the reform policies implemented by the government have improved the \nhealth  sector\u2019s  regulatory  framework  and  management.  However,  issues  remain  and  their \ncauses  need  to  be  carefully  considered.  An  updated  analysis  of  health  policy  and  health \nservices management is needed, including an evaluation of the capacity to implement reforms \nand manage health services effectively at the national and subnational levels. \n \n10.  ADB assistance. ADB has helped improve health service delivery and health sector \nplanning in the Lao PDR through several interventions.11 Since 2007, ADB has helped the \ncountry\u2019s provinces prepare 5-year development plans, enhance their ability to plan and budget, \nand improve the general management competencies of provincial and district health officers in \nthese areas. The MOH benefitted from TA that supported budget formulation with a medium-\nterm expenditure focus.12 ADB has provided conditional block grants to provinces to improve the \ndelivery of health services. An ADB grant approved in 2010 is helping control communicable \ndiseases  and  focuses  on  poor  and  remote  areas.13 This  new  TA  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s \nengagement  in  the  management  of  the  country\u2019s  public  sector,  which  has  addressed \ninstitutional  and  capacity  weaknesses  and  has  emphasized  (i)  the  enhancement  of  public \nfinancial management subsystems related to budget formulation, reporting, and accounting; (ii) \nthe implementation of medium-term fiscal and expenditure frameworks; (iii) the implementation \nof multiyear budgeting and intergovernmental fiscal relations; and (iv) the strengthening of civil \nservice capacity in the central and subnational governments.14 \n \n11.  Lessons learned. Despite the improvements in service capacity and quality achieved \nwith ADB support, weaknesses in the management of the Lao PDR\u2019s health system and the \nlack of adequate financing continue to create system inefficiencies and result in poor quality \nhealth care in the country. Although ADB\u2019s engagement in public sector management improved \nsome government policies, the implementation of the reforms by the line ministries still remains \na challenge. ADB support for reforms in health human resources management in neighboring \ncountries such as Viet Nam is showing good results, but to achieve the same improvements the \nLao PDR still needs to streamline national governance reforms into the health sector and \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2007.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA will support implementation of the government\u2019s National Health Sector Reform \nStrategy and focus on the strategy\u2019s governance reform components, including improvements in \norganization, management, and planning. The impact will be the implementation of governance-\nrelated policy and institutional reform measures in the health sector. The TA outcome will be a \nhealth sector governance reform program submitted to the government.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Policy, regulatory framework, and health sector management system \nreviewed. The TA will review the health policy and regulatory environment and identify areas for \nimprovement. The TA will also analyze health sector management. The analysis will cover \ninstitutional,  organizational,  and  coordination  arrangements;  policy  and  decision-making \nprocesses at the national and subnational levels of administration; management information \nsystems  and  reporting systems;  staffing; financial  management,  procurement,  and  logistics \nmanagement; and licensing and registration. \n \n14.  Output 2: Road map to strengthen policy and regulatory framework and health \nsector management system developed. The TA will identify strategic measures to improve \nhealth financing; intergovernmental fiscal relations; planning and budgeting; participation and \nregulation of private sector and non-state actors; and human resources management, including \nways to correct the qualified health staff gender imbalance. The TA will review good practices \nand lessons on health sector policies and management in neighboring and other Southeast \nAsian countries. It will identify measures to raise operational efficiency and productivity so that \naccess to and the quality of health care can improve. Options for private sector engagement will \nbe explored. The TA will also assess the management capacity at the MOH and the subnational \nlevels  and  recommend  capacity  strengthening  measures.  The  road  map  will  identify \nresponsibilities and accountabilities for implementing recommended actions. The review and the \npreparation of the road map will involve stakeholder consultations. The main activities will \ninclude workshops, meetings, study tours, and report preparation and dissemination. \n \n15.  Output 3: Health sector governance assistance identified and developed. The TA \nwill identify and develop an option for further ADB assistance in governance in the health sector, \nincluding in health services delivery, as appropriate. It will (i) identify potential program and \nproject coverage, activities, and financing; (ii) develop overall program and project management \nand implementation arrangements; (iii) prepare gender, social, and environmental safeguard \ndocuments required for ADB\u2019s engagement; and (iv) prepare other ADB-required documents for \nsupporting health sector governance in the Lao PDR. The TA will prepare knowledge products \nbased on the TA analyses that will include health sector budgeting; financial management; \nrecurrent cost financing; and human resources distribution, licensing, and accreditation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,050,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund  (TASF-V). The government will provide \n ", "    5 \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, utilities, meeting \nvenues, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The MOH will be the executing agency, and the TA will be implemented from 1 April \n2014 to 31 March 2015. A steering committee chaired by the minister of health and including \nrepresentatives of the Ministry of Planning and Investment and the Ministry of Finance will \nreview and guide TA work. The Department of Planning and International Cooperation of the \nMOH will be responsible for TA implementation. The MOH will appoint a project director to \nprovide overall leadership and guide and coordinate TA activities, and a deputy project director \nto support technical meetings and consultations with stakeholders and assist in implementation. \nTechnical  working  groups  on  human  resources  development,  quality  of  care,  and  health \nfinancing will be established to provide technical advice, in coordination with relevant experts \nfrom other ministries and development partners, which will include the Luxembourg Agency for \nDevelopment  Cooperation,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the  World  Health \nOrganization, and the World Bank.  \n \n18.  The TA will support 18 person-months of international consulting services from a health \nsector governance specialist, who will be the team leader; a health planning and financial \nmanagement  specialist;  and  a  health  service  delivery  and  human  resources  management \nspecialist. It will also provide 20 person-months of national consulting services through the \nengagement of national health system reform specialists, a social development and safeguard \nspecialist, and a communications and stakeholder advocacy specialist. To ensure high quality of \ninputs  and  flexibility,  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  as  individual  consultants,  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). Flexibility to mobilize expertise as required will be provided by determining the terms of \nreference and selection method during TA implementation for 4 person-months of international \nand 10 person-months of national consulting services\u2014possibly in the areas of financing, health \npolicy and governance, auditing, accounting, procurement, financial management, safeguards, \nand gender. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA will also \nmobilize short-term resource persons to provide specific expertise, as needed. The TA will \nsupport four national administrative staff members, including an administrator, an accountant, a \ntranslator, and a secretary. Equipment under the TA will be procured by the MOH in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and retained by the \nMOH on completion of the TA. The executing agency will be provided with an advance payment \nfacility. Funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). During previous ADB-funded projects, the \nMOH has demonstrated the capacity to complete activities and liquidate the advance.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Health Sector Governance, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2020:    Assumptions  \nGovernance-related  Health sector  MOH annual report  Adequate external financing, \npolicy and  governance reform  domestic budget resources, and \ninstitutional  activities incorporated  private sector investments are \nmeasures are  in the Eighth National  available in the health sector.   \nimplemented in the  Health Development   \nhealth sector.
