INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to reform the public sector \ncompensation system.1 A TA fact-finding mission on 7 April 2015 reached an agreement with \nthe government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, financial \narrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services for the TA. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  PRC  economy  has  entered  a  new  stage  of  development,  aiming  to  achieve \nsustainable  growth  by  transforming  the  economic  structure,  enhancing  urbanization,  and \nmaintaining balance between economic growth and social development.3 The role of the public \nsector has become increasingly important in realizing sustainable growth. The public sector \ncovers various tiers of governments and public institutions, such as public schools and research \ninstitutions.4 It provides various services that are necessary for economic activities and society, \nsuch as administrative services and social protection. Efficiency in the public sector is critical to \nthe provision of necessary services for those in need with limited fiscal resources. \n \n3.  The Third Plenary Session in November 2013 stressed the importance of public sector \nefficiency,  and  in  March  2015  the  Third  Session  of  the  12th  National  People\u2019s  Congress \nidentified public sector reform as a focal issue. The fundamentals are to redefine the role of the \npublic sector to meet the market economy system, and fulfill the rule of law in the public sector. \nPublic sector reform focuses on restructuring governments and public institutions, streamlining \nadministration procedures, and strengthening capacity for law enforcement. To restructure the \npublic sector and streamline the administration, human resources need to be reallocated and \nrestructured. Furthermore, competent personnel must be attracted and retained to meet the \nnewly defined role of the public sector and strengthen law enforcement. The management of \nhuman resources is, therefore, highlighted as a practical reform area. \n \n4.  To strengthen human resource management, the PRC compensation system, including \nsalary  and  various  benefits,  needs  to  be  reformed.  Governance  and  incentives  are  key. \nGovernance is essential to ensure transparency and accountability for the needed restructuring \nof  the  human  resources  and  corresponding  responsibilities.  An  incentive  mechanism  is \nnecessary in a compensation system to attract and retain competent personnel and improve \nperformance. An incentive mechanism links the performance and professional expertise with \nsalary  increases.  Creating  a  meritocracy  system  will  be  important  to  identify  professional \ncompetencies and hard work, which will lead to better performance and improved efficiency in \nthe public sector. \n \n5.  The critical bottlenecks in strengthening governance of the compensation system of the \nPRC\u2019s public sector are (i) lack of clear administrative authority and process in determining \nsalary and various benefits of government personnel, and (ii) discrepancies between the budget \nallocation and actual expense for salaries. The basic salary in the public sector is based on the \nsalary schedule in the PRC. However, each tier of government or each public institution has \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB. 2015. County Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2015\u20132017. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 May 2015. \n3  The PRC has defined the new stage of development as \u201ca new normal.\u201d \n4  In the PRC, public institutions are categorized as \u201cpublic service units.\u201d \n ", "2   \n \ncertain discretion in the salary amount and increases for each staff member. The administrative \nauthority and process for the discretion is not clearly defined. In addition to the salary, public \nsector  personnel  are  entitled  to  various  benefits,  such  as  compensation  for  transportation \ncosts.5 The administrative authority and process to determine those benefits are also unclear. \nSuch unclear processes critically undermine governance of human resource management, and \nmake the corresponding responsibility for the performance obscure. \n \n6.  In addition, the budget allocation for personnel costs is not necessarily consistent with \nthe actual expense, which indicates that the personnel cost budget may not be executed as \nplanned. This inconsistency between the budget allocation and its actual expense poses a \ncritical question for transparency and responsiveness in budgeting for personnel costs. For the \nactual expense, governments, particularly local governments, prioritize budget execution for \neconomic  development-related  expenses,  and  they  further  tend  to  reallocate  budget  for \npersonnel costs to economic development expenses. Such inconsistency in budget allocation \nand actual expense sometimes causes budget deficits and results in no payment or delayed \npayment  of  salaries,  which  substantially  deteriorates  public  sector  performance.  This  is  a \nserious problem, particularly at lower tiers of government in the PRC. \n \n7.  Another challenge is an incentive mechanism. Compared with the private sector, the \npublic sector does not have an incentive mechanism clearly built in the compensation system. \nThe salary closely links to seniority, but not much to performance. The wage structure is \nrelatively flat in the public sector compared with the private sector. Such wage structure offers \nrelatively high wages for entry level personnel, but low at the middle level in the public sector. \nThat may result in low retention for mid-level personnel, and hinder strengthening of public \nsector performance. Furthermore, recent policy initiatives to reform the public sector\u2019s special \nentitlements would have an impact on the overall package of compensation. In particular, the \ngovernment recently released a policy to unify the public sector pension program with the urban \nenterprise  workers\u2019  program.6 The  impact  of  such  a  policy  change  on  the  compensation \npackage will need to be clarified. \n \n8.  The public sector compensation system needs to be reformed to strengthen human \nresource management and improve public sector efficiency. The wage structure needs to be \nreformed, and the administrative authority and process for determining compensation needs to \nbe clearly defined. Further, a clear incentive mechanism needs to be built in the compensation \nsystem. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC identifies inclusive growth \nas one of three pillars.7 Efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector need to be improved to \nensure the provision of needed public services for inclusive growth.  \n \n10.  The TA will continue and complement support provided by ADB. Previous ADB TA \nprojects supported improving administration procedures and regulatory frameworks, or targeting \n                                                \n5  Those benefits significantly vary among institutions and across regions. \n6  The PRC pension system has a long history of reforms over the decades. As the result of developments focused \non different groups of retirees, the present pension system comprises three separate pension programs: (i) the \nurban enterprise workers\u2019 program, (ii) the special occupations program for civil servants and employees of the \npublic sector, and (iii) the urban and rural residents\u2019 program. To unify the public sector program with the urban \nworkers program, the State Council released Decision on the Reform of the State Employee Pension System in \nJanuary 2015. \n7  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n ", "3 \n \nbeneficiaries of public services.8 An ongoing ADB TA project focuses on coordinating social \nservices, and public and private sector collaboration to improve public sector performance.9 The \nTA will focus on inputs in the public sector, i.e., human resources, to improve its performance \nwith particular attention to its compensation system. The TA will help the government strengthen \ngovernance and incentive mechanisms in human resource management, which is necessary to \nrealize reforms in the public sector and improve efficiency and effectiveness. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  will  be  improved  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  public  sector.  The \noutcome will be an improved public sector compensation system, in terms of governance and \nincentives. The achievement will be measured by the provision of policy recommendations on \nimproving governance and incentives in the public sector compensation system. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will deliver two major outputs: \n \n(i)  policy recommendations (a knowledge product) on improving a compensation \nsystem in the public sector produced; and \n(ii)  capacity  of  relevant  government  officials  improved  to  enhance  their \nunderstanding  of  a  better  compensation  system  in  the  public  sector.  The \nknowledge  product  will  be  disseminated  to  government  officials  and  other \nstakeholders at workshops. \n \n13.  The policy recommendations (a knowledge product) will be based on reviews of the \ncurrent  compensation  system  of  government  institutions  as  well  as  public  service  units, \nparticularly  education,  research,  and  medical  institutions,  in  the  PRC;  and  an  analysis  of \ninternational good practices for compensation systems for the public sector.10 It will also analyze \nlessons from failed reforms in other countries. The scope of the reviews and analysis will cover \na whole compensation system, including basic salaries and various benefits. Key areas to be \nanalyzed will be (i) an administrative mechanism and process to determine the salary and other \nbenefits in the public sector with a clear authority and responsibility, (ii) a system of budget \nallocation  for  personnel  costs  and  actual  expense,  (iii)  wage  structures,  \n(iv) regional salary differences, and (v) incentive mechanisms. The last three areas will also be \nanalyzed in comparison with the private sector. The knowledge product will also cover issues of \nperformance measurement. The TA will analyze challenges in the current compensation system \nof the PRC public sector to improve human resource management and public sector efficiency \nand effectiveness. The TA will produce policy recommendations to address those challenges. \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2010.

To  enhance  awareness  of  key  issues  and  policy  recommendations  to  address  the \nchallenges,  workshops  for  relevant  government  officials  and  other  stakeholders  will  be \nconducted during project implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $315,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, data, logistics, and other in-kind \ncontributions; and will assist in arranging meetings with counterpart agencies (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from July 2015 to July 2017. The executing \nagency is the International Economic and Financial Cooperation Department of the Ministry of \nFinance. The implementing agency is the Comprehensive Department of the Ministry of Finance. \n \n17.  The TA will require a total of 25.5 person-months of consulting services: an international \npublic sector management specialist for 5 person-months, a national public sector specialist \n(government  institutions)  and  team  leader  for  7.5  person-months,  a  national  public  sector \nspecialist (public service units of education and research institutions) for 7 person-months, and \na national public sector specialist (public service units of medical institutions) for 6 person-\nmonths. Four consultants will be engaged individually, since finding an appropriate firm to \nprovide the specific experts would be difficult. All consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The \nterms of reference and specified deliverables are in Appendix 3. Proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). ADB will establish an advance payment facility with the Comprehensive \nDepartment to administer activities related to workshops, subject to the department\u2019s capacity to \ncomplete the activity and liquidate the advance. \n \n18.  The  Comprehensive  Department  will  provide  counterpart  staff,  relevant  existing \ninformation on each of the focal issues, including support to collect needed data to consultants; \nand arrange meeting appointments for consultants with relevant agencies and organizations. \n \n19.  The  Comprehensive  Department,  with  ADB  support,  will  monitor  project-specific \nindicators and targets set in the design and monitoring framework. Project-specific issues will be \ndiscussed with government counterparts during review missions. Technical milestones will be \nmonitored  by  reports  to  be  prepared  by  consultants,  and  reviewed  by  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  and  ADB.  The  team  leader  will  monitor  milestones  related  to  TA \nimplementation. \n \n20.  Project outputs and good practices will be disseminated through workshops for relevant \ngovernment  officials  and  other  stakeholders.  The  Comprehensive  Department  will  be \nresponsible for the conduct of workshops; all workshops are expected to be attended by an \nADB mission, government officials, and specialists in relevant fields to ensure the inclusion of \nexpert views and wide dissemination of project outputs. \n \n ", "5 \n \nIV.
