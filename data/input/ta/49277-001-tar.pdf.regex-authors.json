INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Asia is undergoing one of the most profound demographic shifts in the world. By 2050, \nthe number of people over the age of 65 is expected to exceed 1 billion. The speed and scale of \nchange in the region is creating, and will continue to create, significant social and economic \nchallenges. Traditional family care systems are increasingly stressed and new comprehensive \nelderly  care  systems  that  address  the  risks  of  the  substantial  fiscal  and  negative  social \nconsequences of aging must be developed. Governments, the public and private sectors, and \ncivil society all need to be prepared to work together to address the challenges.1 \n \n2.  The next few years represent a window of opportunity to adapt and create effective \nresponses and strategies in developing member countries (DMCs). The Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020; Social Protection Operational Plan, 2014\u20132020; and Operational Plan for Health, \n2015\u20132020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  all  recognize  the  challenges  this \ndemographic  shift  pose for growth  in the region  and the  risks  of  creating  new  vulnerable \npopulations if these challenges are not addressed.2 The technical assistance (TA) will (i) build a \nknowledge base in Asia and the Pacific on developing elderly care systems and services, and \nidentify potential investments in selected countries; (ii) develop the capacity of DMC officials and \nother stakeholders on strategic planning for and implementation of elderly care across multiple \nsectors (health, social protection, urban development, transport, private sector development); \nand (iii) create a knowledge network to disseminate good practices and expertise. The TA will \nbe a first step in developing a new ADB business line that cuts across sectors and is at the \ncenter of development needs in Asia and the Pacific.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Because of increased longevity and decreased fertility rates, rapid aging has put Asia at \nthe  forefront  of  one  of  the  most  important  global  demographic  trends  and  development \nchallenges. In 2012, 11% of the population in Asia was aged 60 years or above, and by 2050 \nthis is expected to increase to 24% (around 1.26 billion people). The transition is happening at \nan unprecedented pace and at a time when traditional family support systems are weakening as \na result of multiple factors, such as increasing migration and expanding female labor market \nparticipation.4 Establishing and financing alternatives to the traditional care of the elderly by \nfamily members is a growing need. In several DMCs that have rapidly aging populations (e.g., \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam),  the  demographic \ntransitions are happening before the growth of per capita income and the development of social \nprotection systems can provide sufficient support and help to avoid increasing the vulnerability \n(i.e., to income, health, and support issues) of the elderly. Other DMCs, such as the Philippines, \nare not aging as rapidly but will be impacted by regional labor mobility policies, which can \nprovide job opportunities for skilled care givers in this rapidly expanding field. \n                                                \n1  The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) website on 8 March 2016. \n2  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila; \nADB. 2013. Social Protection Operational Plan, 2014\u20132020. Manila; and ADB. 2015. Health in Asia and the Pacific: \nA Focused Approach to Address the Health Needs of ADB Developing Member Countries (Operational Plan for \nHealth, 2015\u20132020). Manila. \n3  TA preparation included discussion with relevant government agencies in the selected DMCs to seek interest and \nestablish that there is demand to take part in the TA in collaboration with staff from regional departments. Once the \nTA is approved, these arrangements will be reconfirmed. \n4  Gender is an important dimension in family-based elderly care. Women tend to carry the heavier burden of caring \nfor spouses and grandchildren, and generally enter old age with fewer assets, lower levels of social security, and \ngreater vulnerability. \n ", " 2\n \n4.  Elderly care can be provided at home, in the community, or in an institutional setting by \npublic, nonprofit, or private sector providers. Elderly care is not just an individual or family issue, \nbut  one  that  must  also  be  addressed  by  communities,  the  private  sector,  nongovernment \norganizations, and governments. Elderly care is a multisector issue requiring a wide range of \nresponses and innovation in physical and sector planning, systems, programs, and capacity \ndevelopment. Many DMCs are developing elderly care policies and services in a piecemeal \nmanner, often in response to immediate political or financial constraints, rather than building \nsustainable integrated (social and health care) systems. The future of elderly care demands \nbetter planning, more financing, more and better qualified human resources, and, above all, \nhigher expectations that the final years of life must have as much meaning, purpose, and well-\nbeing as possible. \n \n5.  The elderly care policies and planning and investment strategies of DMCs can benefit \nfrom the experience of Hong Kong, China; Japan; the Republic of Korea; and Singapore, which \nhave been the region\u2019s leaders in addressing the demands for elderly care in ways that are \nadapted to their needs and circumstances. Countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nIndonesia, Thailand, Tonga, and Viet Nam have also accumulated experience with specific \ncountry characteristics. Internationally recognized concepts such as (i) \u201caging in place,\u201d which \nstresses aging at home safely and independently regardless of age, income, or ability; (ii) \n\u201cactive and healthy aging\u201d to maintain active participation in social, economic, and cultural \naffairs, and physical and mental autonomy and independence; and (iii) mainstreaming aging into \na \u201csociety for all\u201d are principles that can be adapted to the needs and resources of each country. \n \n6.  ADB has a growing portfolio in elderly care and is engaging with DMCs to help mitigate \nthe substantial fiscal and negative social consequences of aging. The TA is a timely response \naimed at building capacity and assisting DMCs in sharing knowledge and taking advantage of \nthe huge investment and job creation opportunities linked to the development of elderly care \nservices and systems. ADB can support DMCs in investing in policies and programs that \npromote healthy aging through the planning and development of the elderly care market, human \nresources,  expansion  of  social  care  services,  investment  in  age-friendly  infrastructure  and \ntransport  systems,  development  of  information  technology  and  management  systems, \nexpansion of health services in areas such as rehabilitation and prevention, and control of \nnoncommunicable diseases through the public and private sectors. Such improvements will \nallow the elderly to fully participate in society, including in the labor market, until an advanced \nage and help reduce the burden and costs for societies and governments. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n7.  The impacts will be (i) commitment of DMCs to develop elderly care services supported \nby ADB financing and knowledge work by 2020 is intensified, and (ii) old-age vulnerabilities in \nAsia and the Pacific are reduced by increasing social protection operations. The outcome will be \nimproved strategic planning and policy development in elderly care. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA will have three components: (i) country diagnostics, (ii) capacity building, and \n(iii) networking and dissemination. Six countries were chosen to conduct in-depth diagnostic \n ", "3 \nstudies on elderly care (Indonesia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, and Viet Nam).5 \nThese  studies  will  assess  gaps  in  key  areas  (policies,  programs,  services,  financing,  and \nsystems development) and identify future policy development and investment options. The \ncountry diagnostics will be followed by a capacity building program for countries in Asia and the \nPacific on strategic planning and policy development for elderly care services and will share \ninternational and regional best practices. The TA will support networking and dissemination of \nfindings and publications on strategic planning for elderly care.6 \n \n9.  Key activities of the TA will be organized under three outputs: \n(i)  Output  1:  Knowledge  base  on  elderly  care  improved. Under this output, \ncountry  diagnostics  on  elderly  care  will  be  conducted  in  six  DMC  countries \nrepresenting several ADB regional departments. Countries were selected based \non factors such as (a) demographic change, (b) existing interest in developing \naging  policies  and  programs,  (c)  documented  good  practices,  and  (d) low\u2013\nmiddle\u2013high income economies spread. The selected countries are Indonesia, \nMongolia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, and Viet Nam. The country diagnostics \nwill  address  areas  such  as  policy  and  regulatory  frameworks,  institutional \narrangements and capacity, consumer needs and service provider assessments, \nhuman resources, financing, and identification of investment opportunities. The \ncountry  diagnostics  will  provide  the  basis  for  inputs  to  (a)  selected  country \npartnership strategies on elderly care and investment options,7 (b) the design of \nthe  capacity  building  program  and  target  countries  under  output  2,  and  (c) \ncontacts and content for the e-network under output 3. \n(ii)  Output 2: Capacity of developing member countries to develop policies and \nplans for elderly care services increased. This output will focus on capacity \nbuilding, planning, and assessment methodologies for the development of elderly \ncare systems and services for DMC government, private sector, and civil society \nparticipants across Asia and the Pacific. It will create partnerships with at least \nthree centers of excellence on elderly care (e.g., in Japan, the Republic of Korea, \nand Thailand). These centers will engage in research, facilitate networking, and \nhelp conduct the capacity building activities, which will support the overall TA. \nCapacity  building  will  focus  on  (a)  building  policy  and  planning  capacity  in \nselected DMCs; (b) supporting south\u2013south cooperation and exchange on good \nelderly care practices and experiences in Asia and the Pacific; (c) conducting \nresearch  on  emerging  topics,  such  as  developing  financial  and  information \ntechnology  services  and  products  to  support  elderly  care,  human  resources \ndevelopment, and quality assessment; (d) identifying and designing innovative \ninvestments supporting development of home, community, and institutional care \noptions in elderly care; and (e) enhancing policy implementation monitoring and \nevaluation.  The  capacity  building  program  will  support  the  development  of \npublications  and  training  materials  to  be  disseminated  under  output  3  and \ncontacts and content for the e-network. \n                                                \n5  The request for official nomination of the implementing agency will be sent together with the request for TA no-\nobjection letter to the government. \n6  The TA will complement other initiatives undertaken by ADB and other development partners, such as: ADB. 2014. \nTechnical Assistance for Assessing and Monitoring Social Protection Programs in Asia and the Pacific. Manila; a \nproposed TA for Viet Nam on Strengthening the Policy and Institutional Framework of Social Health Insurance; and \na  proposed  employment diagnostic  study  for  Sri  Lanka  in  ADB.  2011.  Technical  Assistance  for  Improving \nEmployment Outcomes. Manila. \n7  Four of the six countries assessed in the country diagnostics will be chosen for in-depth identification of investment \nopportunities. \n ", " 4\n(iii)  Output  3:  Knowledge  sharing  and  networking  systems  developed.  This \noutput will create a sustainable knowledge sharing and networking system, which \nwill  (a)  ensure knowledge transfer  during  the TA;  (b)  create  a repository  of \nmaterials  and  publications  (including  country  assessments,  research  reports, \nassessment guidelines, and cross-country data); and (c) develop an e-network of \nprofessionals and specialists in government, the private sector, and civil society \nworking in elderly care across Asia and the Pacific. This network will provide \nparticipants and resource persons for the regional conferences and workshops \nand, through the exchange of people and ideas on key topics, thus contribute to \nthe development of new elderly care policies and plans in selected countries. The \noutput will also support the design and delivery of the Active Aging in Asia \nconference in 2017, which will be cosponsored by the Japanese Ministry of \nHealth, Labour and Welfare and will build on the ministry\u2019s cooperation with the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. This conference will support sharing of \nbest  practices  in  developing  policies,  implementing  services,  and  designing \ninvestments  in  elderly  care  from  Japan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  other \ncountries within Asia and the Pacific. The output will support regional cooperation \nin developing elderly care and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and \nfacilitate the expansion of business development and investments for ADB in the \nfuture. \n \n10.  A potential risk to successful TA implementation is the lack of interest in or capacity of \nthe selected countries to invest in elderly care. This risk is considered manageable given the \ngrowing interest internationally and within Asia and the Pacific in addressing the impacts of \naging and the need for elderly care. A second risk is ineffective coordination among country \nstakeholders and with ADB teams working in this field. This risk will be mitigated by creating a \nworking group with focal points from each ADB regional department, which will help ensure \ngood  coordination  with  government  and  other  stakeholders  and  linkages  to  portfolio \ndevelopment. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.5 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, both to be administered by \nADB. \n \n12.  The TA budget will also support knowledge creation and sharing for other DMCs at the \nregional level and publication and dissemination activities. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented from May 2016 to May 2019. ADB will be the executing \nagency, through  collaboration between the East Asia Department (EARD), the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department,  and with regional departments for country-\nspecific  activities.  EARD\u2019s  Urban  and  Social  Sectors  Division  will  undertake  the  overall \nadministrative  and  coordinating  role  for  the  TA,  including  engaging  and  managing  the \nconsultants. EARD and the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will \nwork together to provide supervision and advisory support for all TA components. A working \ngroup, comprising staff from each of the regional departments and representatives from Social \nDevelopment  and  Health  Sector  Groups,  will  be  established  to  provide  guidance  for  the \n ", "5 \ncountry  diagnostics  and  to  ensure  that  findings  are  integrated  into    country  partnership \nstrategies and knowledge documents. Relevant ministries in the selected countries will serve \nas knowledge partners for the country diagnostics and capacity building components. The TA \nwill also be implemented in collaboration with centers of excellence, which will provide additional \ntechnical expertise. ADB staff may also serve as resource persons in workshops and provide \nadministrative  or  secretarial  support  services  for  the  implementation  of  regional  training, \nseminar, and conference activities. \n \n14.  It is expected that 186 person-months (32 international and 154 national) of consulting \nservices will be engaged for the proposed project. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3. The TA requires highly qualified international and national experts in the field of \nelderly care, including in assessment, planning, regulation, and financing. These experts will be \nrequired to demonstrate strong experience and familiarity with elderly care and sector policy \ndevelopment in Asia and globally. A consulting firm will be engaged using a 90:10 quality- and \ncost-based selection method with simplified technical proposal for the team of international \nconsultants consisting of an elderly care specialist and team leader (10 person-months), an \nelderly care health specialist (4 person-months), and an elderly care financing specialist (2 \nperson-months),  as  well  as  for  national  consultants  consisting  of  12  country  diagnostic \nspecialists (6 person-months each), and eight investment opportunity specialists (3 person-\nmonths each for four countries). Using individual consultant selection, the TA will engage (i) a \nTA coordination and knowledge management specialist (24 person-months national consultant), \n(ii)  a  content  analysis  and  writing  specialist  (18  person-months  national  consultant),  and \nconsultants from three centers of excellence (16 person-months international consultant and 16 \nperson-months  national  consultant)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Partnerships with the centers of excellence \non elderly care will be established after the inception of the TA. Proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with the ADB Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time).8 \n \n15.  Good practices and lessons learned will be actively disseminated through outputs 2 \n(capacity building) and 3 (knowledge sharing and networking). Findings of output 1 (country \ndiagnostics) will be presented to national policy makers, relevant industry associations, and \nacademia to obtain feedback. Major findings and lessons learned from the TA will be published \nin at least one TA synthesis report targeting DMC stakeholders and ADB staff. A website for \nknowledge dissemination and networking will be established under the TA. After the TA closes, \nthe website will be maintained under the activities of the Social Development Thematic Group in \nADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n16.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and (ii) ADB administering \na portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund,  for \nStrengthening Developing Member Countries\u2019 Capacity in Elderly Care, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                \n8  To reduce the administrative burden and to improve economy, efficiency, and value for money, consulting services \nunder the TA will be engaged on output-based (lump-sum) contracts whenever feasible. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is Aligned with \nDMCs\u2019 commitment to develop elderly care services supported by ADB financing and knowledge work by \n2020 intensified (Midterm Review of Strategy 2020; Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020)a \n \nOld-age vulnerabilities in Asia and the Pacific reduced by increasing social protection operations \n(Social Protection Operational Plan, 2014\u20132020)b \n  Performance Indicators \nwith Targets and  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2019     \nStrategic planning  Number of new elderly  Selected country elderly  Existing commitment of \nand policy  care policies and plans in  care policy and plans  DMCs to improving \ndevelopment in  selected countries (2016  (including titles, dates,  elderly care systems is \nelderly care  baseline: 0)  areas of focus)  not sustained \nimproved     \n   \nOutputs       \n1.
