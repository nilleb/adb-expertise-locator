External assistance, especially concessional loans and grants play a critical role in \nTajikistan. To improve the institutional structure and capacity of the Aid Coordination Unit (ACU) \nunder the Office of the President of Tajikistan, Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided TA-\n3617: Improving Aid Coordination and External Debt Management.1 The technical assistance \nwas completed in July 2004. However, ACU needs to further strengthen capacity in terms of \nbetter technical staffing, improved budget support, reduced dependence on external support \nand harmonized procedures to serve as the main agency for aid coordination. In order to \nimprove  aid  coordination  and  portfolio  management  capacity  of  ACU,  the  Government \nrequested ADB for a follow-up technical assistance (TA) during the 2004 Country Programming \nMission.  The  TA  Fact-Finding  Mission  (the  Mission)  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing, implementation arrangements \nand consulting services for the TA. 2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Tajikistan is a large recipient of donor assistance with about 40 key donors pursuing \ndiverse activities in the country. Beginning from independence in 1991, external debt, which was \nnonexistent,  grew  to  $850  million  by  2000.  Of  this,  $320  million  came  from  multilateral \ninstitutions. To improve aid coordination and external debt management in the wake of the \nsignificant rise in foreign aid commitment to Tajikistan, the Government established the ACU \nwith  assistance  originally  from  World  Bank  (1995\u201396)  and  then  from  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) (1997\u201398). However, it lacked formal institutional structure. \nThere was also a lack of cooperation among development partners which resulted in overlap of \nresponsibilities  in  different  ministries  and  uncoordinated  implementation  of  programs  and \nprojects.  This  led  to  high  transaction  costs,  fragmentation  of  administrative  capacity,  and \nreduction in aid effectiveness. The ACU disintegrated as soon as UNDP funding ended. In \nresponse to a request from the Government, ADB approved TA-3617 in 2000. \n \n3.  The  objectives  of  TA-3617  were  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  the \nGovernment to improve aid coordination, develop a process of multi-year Public Investment \nProgram (PIP), and improve external debt management. It reestablished ACU, trained ACU and \nPIP Division staff in database processes and procedures for aid management, project appraisal, \nand underlined the importance of economic analysis. The TA also produced an annual aid \nreport. It helped ACU construct a database on and improve procedures and guidelines for aid \ncoordination. Although aid coordination process has improved, institutional capacity limitations \nremain. The two major lessons learned during implementation of earlier assistance to aid \ncoordination are (i) the importance of continued training and building of capacity over a longer \ntime frame so as to render the process for effective aid coordination more sustainable, and      \n(ii) the clear articulation of the roles and responsibilities of all those involved in aid coordination \nincluding the need to empower those that are mandated with this task.   \n \n4.  In addition, there are a number of important activities that remain to be undertaken.  For \nexample, procedures are not in place to centralize and catalogue all aid-agreements at ACU. \nTechnological upgrade is also imperative to make the database more efficient and effective for \npolicy and economic analysis through development of computer programs and tools to compile \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance Cluster to the Republic of Tajikistan for Improving Aid Coordination and External \nDebt Management. Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 21 October 2004. \n ", "2  \nand process aid database. There is lack of Government staff adept on the existing database \nand procedures to ensure its sustainability and further improvements. This can be addressed \nthrough provision of additional training seminars and workshops on using the aid coordination \nprocedures to staff of ACU, PIUs and other relevant ministries as well as training of trainers to \nguarantee transfer of knowledge and skills. As stressed during the 2004 Consultative Group \n(CG)  Meeting  there  is  also  a  need  to  improve  the  process  of  information  sharing  and \ncomprehensive analysis of aid coordination.  \n \n5.  Furthermore,  several  specific  issues  of  portfolio  management  require  immediate \nattention  of  the  Government,  such  as  delays  in  project  start-up  and  in  loan  signing  and \neffectiveness, partly due to lack of clear financial management, accounting, procurement and \nauditing procedures. Various ministries and departments do not follow standard procedures for \nloan assigning and vetting of signed legal documents. There are also delays in establishing and \nstaffing project implementation units (PIU). These issues adversely affect the country\u2019s portfolio \nof development assistance and need to be addressed on a priority basis through simplified \nsystems  and  procedures  including  development  of  a  portfolio  performance  management \nsystem. \n \n6.  Donor commitments are rising rapidly. At the 4th CG meeting in 2003 donors pledged \n$900 million of assistance for the next 3 years including $700 million grants. A well-functioning \naid  coordination  and  management  system  requires  harmonization  of  donor  programs  with \ncountry  strategies  and  coordination  of  activities  of  ministries  and  nongovernmental \norganizations. For poor, aid-dependent countries such as Tajikistan, meeting multiple donor \nrequirements  and  following  varying  donor  operational  policies  and  procedures  creates \nsubstantial burden on their administrative capacity and weakens their own development plans \nand capacity for effective public management. Good practice to reduce burden on partner \ncountry and to ensure lower cost of aid delivery includes capacity development of the country to \nprovide quality information, development of common formats, contents and approaches on \nprocesses,  and  procedures  for  managing  development  assistance,  simplification  of  donor \nrequirements, and reduction in the number of donor missions.3 Harmonization provides a means \nto  enhancing  development  effectiveness,  reducing  transaction  costs,  and  promoting \ntransparency. At the 5th CG meeting held on 5 November 2004, donors committed to further \nexplore ways to improve donor coordination and stressed the importance of harmonizing in the \nareas  of  procurement,  financial  reporting  and  auditing.    The  importance  of  sector-wide \napproaches (SWAp) was also stressed as a tool to harmonize donor assistance at the sector \nlevel. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The TA will improve development impact and overall aid effectiveness in Tajikistan \nthrough strengthening capacity of the Government in better aid coordination, harmonization, and \nstrengthening of portfolio management.4 Active participants in the TA process will comprise the \n                                                \n3 Development Assistance Committee Guidelines and Reference Series: Harmonizing Donor Practices for Effective \nAid  Delivery,  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  2003, \nhttp://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/0/48/20896122.pdf. \n4 This TA is being undertaken in close cooperation with UNDP, which is proposing a parallel but complementary \nexercise through a $250,000 TA from 2004 to 2006. Among other things, their focus is on (i) information and \ncoordination support services involving international, national and local stakeholders and partners; (ii) regional \ncoordination involving local government authorities and nongovernment organizations; and (iii) general functioning \n \n ", "  3\nGovernment and multilateral and bilateral development organizations. The TA incorporates \ncomments from development partners such as UNDP and the World Bank. The participatory \napproach will enhance sharing of knowledge, information and experience, and facilitate dialogue \nand negotiation with external funding agencies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will comprise five interrelated elements: \n \n(i)  ACU as the main agency for aid coordination. This component will strengthen \nthe responsibilities and authorities of ACU to improve coordination of activities of \ninternational  organizations,  interdepartmental  cooperation,  mechanism  of \nimplementation of PIP and monitoring of the projects, and implementation of joint \nactions of Government and donors, particularly the implementation of the Action \nPlan agreed between the Government and the Country Portfolio Review Mission \nin March 2004. The Plan indicated the need for a focal point in the Government \nwith appropriate capability and authority for cross-agency coordination for better \nportfolio management. The role of ACU as the focal point will be codified through \nrelevant regulatory legal acts, which will strengthen its coordination authority, \nprevent duplication in the work of line ministries and agencies in the issues \nrelated to coordination and management of external aid. This component will also \nstreamline and strengthen the regulation of ACU and other ministries in terms of \nlines of authority and reporting arrangements, and data-sharing mechanisms \nbetween all stakeholders of the process of providing and using external aid. \n \n(ii)  Database and management information system development. The TA will \nstandardize, strengthen and build upon the existing database and focus on the \nuse of this data for economic analysis and further external aid coordination. \nTowards this end, the TA will develop computer programs and tools to compile \nand analyze aid database and design standardized reporting mechanisms for \nquarterly, semiannual or annual updates on project and program implementation \nprogress, impacts and achievements. It will also enhance ACU\u2019s website for \ncustomized viewing and demonstrate how its content can be leveraged to meet \nthe needs of different audiences. The management information system will be \nupgraded  to  strengthen  the  current  system  of  aid  coordination,  monitoring \nplanned and proposed projects; proposals in processing stage; loans and grants \nunder implementation; progress of bids; contract awards; procurement; progress \nof project implementation; budget formulation and disbursements. \n \n(iii)  Harmonization of donor programs with national strategy and policies. This \ncomponent will facilitate and promote policy dialogue between the Government \nand  external  agencies  for  adopting  common  programmatic  approaches  on \nprocesses  and  procedures.  The  TA  will  devise  simplified  systems  and \nprocedures  applicable  to  both  the  Government  and  donors  in  various \nprogram/project activities. It will organize workshops to discuss and ascertain \nviews of stakeholders on the proposed improvements to the procedures and \ninstitutional structure and to determine their information requirements for project \nmanagement and monitoring. Potential areas for harmonization of donor policies, \n                                                                                                                                                       \nof ACU. It will also provide assistance in setting up a website for posting and exchanging information with donors \nand other stakeholders and address the issues of staffing, salary and budget support. \n ", "4  \nprocedures  and  practices  in  Tajikistan  are  financial  management  and \naccountability,  procurement,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards. \n \n(iv)  Capacity building of ACU for effective portfolio management. Key activities \nrelating to effective portfolio management will include devising simplified systems \nand procedures including development of portfolio performance management \nsystem. Portfolio management will be strengthened through development of a \nsimplified  monthly  and  quarterly  reporting  system  to  monitor  project \nimplementation  and  estimate  disbursement  requirements  based  on  project \nprogress;  development  of  capacity  in  ACU  to  develop  forecasts  on  physical \nprogress, cash flow requirements for the next 6 to 8 quarters and integrate the \nentire  system  in  fiscal  planning  and  budgetary  process.  The  TA  will  help           \n(a) streamline the system of internal clearances to ensure that project start-up \ndelays are minimized, (b) devise procedures and systems for recruitment and \nretention  of  key  project  staff  during  project  implementation,  (c)  expedite \nprocurement  and  consultant  selection  through  introduction  of  harmonized \nprocedures  acceptable  to  all  donors,  (d)  devise  simplified  accounting  and \nauditing manuals for use by project management units (PMUs) in accordance \nwith  financial  management  guidelines  of  various  donors,  (e)  strengthen  the \nmonitoring system of portfolio performance by key project activities for sustained \ninformation flow among stakeholders, and (f) provide training to ACU and PMU \nstaff for implementing the new procedures devised under the TA for effective \nportfolio management. \n \n(v)  Development of ACU\u2019s human resources. Training seminars and workshops \nwill  be  organized  to  impart  analytical  and  technical  training  to  use  the  aid \ncoordination procedures to staff of ACU, PIUs, line ministries, and departments. \nTo develop local skills and make the process sustainable and cost effective, local \nconsultants  will  help  develop  training  materials  and  impart  training.  This \ncomponent will also include training of trainers especially for resource staff at \ncentral  and  local  levels  who  can  later  transfer  their  knowledge  and  skill  to \noperating staff at raion or oblast levels. The training program will ensure that the \nstaff  gain  the  requisite  capacity  to  implement  procedures  and  portfolio \nperformance management systems approved by the Government and consented \nby donors. ACU staff will also be trained to measure and monitor progress in \nperformance indicators in an indicative framework.5 Capacity building programs \nwill be designed according to country preparedness and absorptive capacity. \n \n9.  It is assumed that major donors are willing to fully align and harmonize capacity building \nefforts and the Government and donors are committed to assist implementation of the agenda \nwith adequate resources. Adequate budget support is required for long-term sustainability of \ntechnical staff. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $625,000 equivalent of which $390,000 \nequivalent is the foreign exchange cost and $235,000 equivalent local currency cost. ADB will \n                                                \n5 Monitoring of key indicators in the indicative framework involves a move toward specified benchmarks but not \nnecessarily achievement of predetermined levels in a short span of time. \n ", "  5\nfinance  $500,000  equivalent  comprising  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $110,000 \nequivalent of local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency equivalent through the \nprovision of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and secretarial and office support services. \nDetailed cost estimates and proposed financing arrangements are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The Office of the President of Tajikistan will be the Executing Agency. The Government \nwill provide all necessary information to effectively carry out the TA. All the TA activities will be \nimplemented through the ACU, which will hold quarterly meetings with ADB (through Tajikistan \nResident Mission) to monitor the progress of the TA and ensure that its objectives are met. Key \nline ministries and resident missions of other donor agencies will be invited to participate at the \nmeetings at their own cost. To facilitate implementation, Advance Payment Facility will be made \navailable to enable the EA to conduct activities such as workshops, meetings and seminars. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented in three phases over 24 months from March 2005 to \nFebruary  2007.  During  Phase  I  a  report  on  processes  and  procedures  for  management \ndevelopment assistance to harmonize donor programs in the Government's strategies and \npolicies will be prepared. During Phase II a training program for government officials and \ntrainers  will  be  developed,  including  training  materials,  a  handbook  on  procedures  and \nprocesses, as well as installing the upgraded MIS and developing the appropriate computer \npackages. Activities during Phase III will comprise (i) training of ACU staff and officials in \nrelevant  ministries,  project  management  units,  project  implementation  units,  and  trainers;        \n(ii) establishing the need for relevant handbooks and manuals for use of government officials \nand ACU staff; (iii) preparing a report on TA progress, key issues, recommended follow on \nactivities for functioning and self-sustainability of ACU; and (iv) developing and institutionalizing \nprocesses for organizing regular workshops, seminars, and meetings with international aid \nagencies and public officials.  \n \n13.  The TA will require 12 person-months of international consulting and 45 person-months \nof  domestic  consulting  services  comprising:  harmonization,  aid  coordination,  external  debt \nmanagement  specialists  (5  person-months  international  and  18  person-months  domestic); \nproject management specialists (2 person-months international and 7 person-months domestic); \nprocurement  specialists  (2  person-months  international  and  7  person-months  domestic); \ndatabase management and information systems specialist (3 person-months international and \n13 person-months domestic). Outline terms of reference for consulting services required under \nthe TA are given in Appendix 3. A qualified firm of international consultants with domestic \nassociates will be engaged to provide services in accordance with the terms of reference and \nSimplified Technical Proposal method of selection, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.
