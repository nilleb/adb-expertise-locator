INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will build up the capacity and \nenhance the knowledge of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in preparing \na  strategy  and  implementing  actions  on  integrated  watershed  environmental  management \n(IWEM), river and ocean eco-environmental management, and plastic waste pollution control1 \nthat will support the implementation of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) Development \nPlan2 and the Rural Vitalization Strategy,3 aligned with the PRC\u2019s vision of achieving an ecological \ncivilization.4 \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy \nfor the PRC, 2016\u20132020;5 included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for the PRC, 2019\u2013\n2021;6 and aligned with key operational priorities of the Strategy 2030, especially in the area of \nIWEM.7 The TA will also support innovation in the reform of institutions and use of policy \nmechanisms for improved environmental management. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The government has been promoting ecological civilization, with specific targets identified \nin the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020.8 Ecological civilization denotes a departure \nfrom the past emphasis on economic growth as the core of development to the prioritization of \nquality and efficient development. However, water pollution control in major watersheds of the \nPRC has recorded slow progress, with the water and eco-environmental impacts to downstream \nareas  highlighting  the  importance  of  linkages  between  river  and  ocean  ecological  and \nenvironmental areas. \n \n4.  The proposed TA complements lending and nonlending assistance under ADB\u2019s YREB \nframework  approach,  addressing  the  areas  of  ecosystem  restoration  and  environmental \nprotection, institutional and policy reform, and capacity building. ADB is also co-leading a special \npolicy study on eco-compensation and green development institutional reform in the YREB with \nthe China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development to create an \nenabling policy framework and serve as a knowledge-sharing platform. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 1 April 2019. \n2  Government of the PRC. 2016.

Water pollution from source to sea is regarded as one \nof the most significant challenges facing many countries, especially in the Asia and Pacific region. \nPlastic waste pollution has been particularly identified as an issue that adversely affects the global \ncommunity and environment. With the development of the PRC\u2019s economy and the corresponding \nrise in income levels, the demand for plastic products has grown at an increasing rate, with \nconsumption of plastic products increasing from fewer than 40 million tons in 2008 to more than \n75 million tons in 2017.9 During the PRC\u2019s Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party, \nthe Party Central Committee and the State Council accorded high importance to addressing the \nissue of solid waste pollution, especially white pollution caused by plastic wastes.10 The problem \nof plastic waste pollution has become increasingly serious and has a great impact on society and \necosystems, especially in river and ocean ecological and environmental areas, where plastic \nwastes are impacting on fragile ecosystem and biodiversity in the PRC and globally. Plastic \nproducts have an extremely long degradation life cycle in nature, and improper disposal of plastic \nwastes causes significant negative impacts on ecological and environmental areas. A draft action \nplan  on  white  pollution  control  has  been  prepared  by  the  PRC\u2019s  Ministry  of  Ecology  and \nEnvironment (MEE) and the National Development and Reform Commission to focus on plastic \nwaste pollution from agricultural plastic products, plastic packaging, and plastic shopping bags.11 \n \n6.  River and ocean eco-environmental management. The institutional and regulatory \nfunctions and responsibilities governing the management and protection of river surface water \nand groundwater, and ocean eco-environmental management are not well coordinated, with \npotential overlap and unclear division of duties and responsibilities across the central government \nand the provincial-level river and marine eco-environmental management bodies. This lack of \ncoordination among institutions and on regulations poses the risk of compromising various other \necosystem services. Weak institutional capacity and coordination mechanisms have the potential \nto  compromise  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  eco-environmental  programs.  The \nEnvironmental Protection Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China (2014 Revision) requires that \nthe Ministry of Environmental Protection (currently known as the MEE) of the State Council must \nsupervise and manage environmental protection across the PRC.12 The Marine Environmental \nProtection Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China (1999 amended) requires that the State \nCouncil\u2019s ministries relating to environmental protection and oceans be responsible for the \nsupervision and management of marine and ocean environmental areas.13 The Water Pollution \nPrevention and Control Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China (2018 amended) requires that \nministries (such as agriculture, construction, fishery, national land and resources, sanitation, and \nwater administration departments) together with water resources protection agencies in major \nriver and lake areas must supervise and manage water pollution prevention and remediation.14 \nHowever, many of the laws have resulted in a relatively uncoordinated institutional and regulatory \nduties and systems for river and ocean eco-environmental management. \n \n                                                \n9  http://www.fjpia.com/fjpia/news/disp.asp?news_id=1018 and http://www.szbxc88.com/Article/2017nzgslz.html. \n10 White pollution refers to pollution caused by plastic wastes such as single-use plastic tableware and thin plastic bags, \nwhich are a major source of municipal solid waste with significant negative impact on environmental and amenity \nvalues. \n11 Use of the term \u201cwhite pollution\u201d refers to plastic waste pollution, especially plastic shopping bags, plastic packaging, \nand mulch film. \n12 Government of the PRC, National People\u2019s Congress. 2014.

The plan sets targets for environmental improvement of the YREB, including \nthe following: (i) by 2020, 75% of the YREB\u2019s water bodies meet the government\u2019s class III \nstandard or above for surface water quality; and forest coverage reaches 43%; and (ii) by 2030, \nthe watershed ecosystem and environmental quality are improved; and ecosystem functions are \nsignificantly enhanced.15 Significant improvement in agency coordination, institutional reform, and \ncapacity building are needed for these targets to be achieved. \n \n8.  The  TA  will  build  capacity  to  support  the  improved  coordination  of  institutions  and \nregulations, which will strengthen the national river and ocean ecological and environmental \nmanagement systems. A case study on plastic waste pollution control and management will raise \nawareness about the significant solid waste management challenge, which has major impacts on \nriver and ocean ecological and environmental areas, with national and global ramifications. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  Institutional reform of the IWEM roles and clarification of functional responsibilities are \nimportant factors in improving river and ocean eco-environmental pollution control, including \nplastic waste pollution control. These reforms and clarification efforts will be supported by relevant \nlaws and regulations. \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: ecological and environmental protection in the \nYREB achieved (footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: coordinated river and ocean \neco-environmental management and plastic waste pollution control systems enhanced.16 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: River and ocean ecological and environmental management system \nanalyzed. This output will develop policy and research reports on recommended proposals for \ninstitutional  reform  of  the  river  and  ocean  eco-environmental  management  functions  and \nprocesses for review and approval of ministerial decision makers through (i) a review of the \ncurrent legal and institutional landscape for ecological and environmental management of river \nand ocean environmental areas, with a focus on the Yangtze River and its connectivity to the East \nSea; (ii) identification of issues, gaps, and challenges in the integrated river and ocean ecological \nand environmental management, including the legal foundation and decision-making procedure, \nfinancial support, operating mechanism, information management, and public participation; (iii) \npromotion of the understanding of international best practices and the undertaking of comparative \nanalysis  of  integrated  river  and  ocean  ecological  and  environmental  management  through \nconducting selected study visits with 10\u201312 participants in developed countries; and (iv) multiple \nstakeholder  consultation  meetings  on  river  and  ocean  eco-environmental  management \napproaches, including the river, lake, or gulf chief system.

Output 2: Strategy for plastic waste management prepared. This output will formulate \na preliminary roadmap or strategy for the effective management of white pollution through (i) a \nreview of current strategy and practices for solid waste management, with a focus on plastic \nwastes and case studies (particularly on the use of plastic shopping bags and plastic packaging \nin  the  consumer  food  and  retail  sector);  (ii)  examination  of  (a)  issues,  challenges,  and \neffectiveness and gaps in current strategies and programs which address plastic waste collection \nand disposal; and (b) opportunities for recycling and reuse; (iii) screening and selection of good \npractices and approaches; and (iv) preparation of a research report which incorporates the \nrecommendations for suggested actions on plastic waste pollution control to support the roadmap \nor strategy, including conduct of case studies in three cities or provinces; and on preliminary gap \nassessment against international best practices from two model cities. \n \n13.  Output 3: Knowledge and skills in institutional coordination for ecological and \nenvironmental management and plastic waste pollution control improved. This output will \ninclude (i) conduct of capacity building and knowledge sharing activities to be led by local and \ninternational experts, aiming to improve institutional coordination for protection and management \nof river and ocean ecological and environmental areas and for plastic waste pollution control, \nincluding preparation of the workshop or conference proceedings and/or training materials from \ninternational workshops and study visits in the PRC and other countries; and (ii) preparation of a \nknowledge product that captures and summarizes the experiences, findings, and key lessons \nfrom the inputs collected under Output 1 and the two case studies conducted under Output 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $650,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of remuneration and travel \nexpenses of counterpart staff, domestic transportation, available relevant government data and \nstudies for the TA consultants\u2019 use, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA and will (i) recruit, supervise, and evaluate the TA consultants; \n(ii) organize workshops in consultation with the MEE, the executing agency; and (iii) provide staff \nto act as resource persons in the workshops and training programs. \n \n17.  A project leading group to be established by the MEE will be responsible for guiding and \nsupervising  the  overall implementation  of the TA. The  project  leading group  will  comprise \nmembers from the MEE\u2019s Foreign Environmental Cooperation Center (FECO), the Department of \nInstitutional Administration and Human Resources Management, and the Department of Solid \nWastes and Chemicals. The FECO is the implementing unit responsible for (i) provision of \nmanagement support for the TA activities; and (ii) coordination with government agencies for \nawareness raising, capacity building, and knowledge dissemination. The director of the FECO\u2019s \ninternational cooperation division will serve as the project director and main contact for the TA. A \nstakeholder  participation  mechanism  will  be  established  during  the  TA  implementation. \nStakeholders  will  include  entities  active  in  plastic  waste  pollution  control,  including  sector \nagencies, the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission of the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Water \nResources, representatives of provincial and/or local governments, nongovernment organizations, \nand the private sector. \n ", "5 \n18.
