I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $152,200,000, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $42,200,000 and (ii) a B loan of up to \n$110,000,000, and a proposed political risk guarantee (PRG) of up to $110,000,000 of principal \nplus interest, interest breakage costs, and PRG fees1 for commercial lenders for the Myingyan \nNatural Gas Power Project in Myanmar.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  After several decades of underinvestment, the development of Myanmar\u2019s energy sector \nlags  other  Asian  countries,  despite  abundant  energy  resources,  including  hydropower  and \nnatural gas. In March 2015, Myanmar had 4,655 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity, of which \nhydroelectric power plants accounted for 3,151 MW (67.7%). The available capacity is only \nabout  50%  of  the  total.3 Gas  and  coal  power  plants  are  not  fully  operated  due  to  poor \nmaintenance, while hydropower lacks water during the dry season. Hence, Myanmar\u2019s power \ngrid experiences significant load shedding during the dry season of up to 500 MW. Annual per \ncapita electricity consumption in 2013 was 165 kilowatt-hours (kWh), among the lowest in the \nworld. 4 The  world  average  consumption  is  3,000  kWh/capita;  the  least-developed  country \naverage is 174 kWh/capita. The inadequate and unreliable supply of electricity and the high cost \nof backup generators are major obstacles for industries and major hindrances to economic \ngrowth.  The  lack  of  electricity  also  hampers  social  progress;  health,  education,  and  other \nessential services were negatively impacted by the low electrification rate of 33% in 2014.5 \n \n3.  Since 2011, the Myanmar government has introduced important economic and political \nreforms, and significantly improved the regulatory framework for foreign direct investment. In \nparticular, it has pursued a policy of liberalizing the energy sector and opening it up to foreign \ninvestment.  In  2013,  Myanmar  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  for  the \ndevelopment of a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) framework and tools to better direct and \nbalance PPP project outcomes. ADB Southeast Asia Department provided technical assistance \n(TA) to help the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) develop fair and balanced terms for private \nsector  investment  in  power  generation.6 The TA  established  international  standard  criteria, \nprocesses, analytic methods, and documentation to provide a sound basis for government \ntendering  of  projects  with  private  sector  participation,  by  taking  advantage  of  established \nprinciples  of  competitive  bidding  and  procurement  criteria  in  other  countries  with  a  sound \nregulatory framework. ADB provided MOEP with a draft framework power purchase agreement \n(PPA) and tendering documents, such as a request for proposal template for a variety of power \ngeneration technologies. \n \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) maximum aggregate liability under the PRG will be $240 million.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Government of Myanmar, Ministry of Electric Power. 2015.

An  International  Finance  Corporation  advisory  team  was  subsequently  appointed to \nassist MOEP in preparing the bidding process for the Myingyan Natural Gas Power Project. The \nproject will design, supply, construct, commission, operate, and maintain a combined-cycle, \ngas-fired power generation plant with a net capacity of 225 MW. The draft PPA and other tender \ntemplate documents developed by ADB form the basis of the Myingyan bidding process, which \nis the first competitive and transparent tender for a power plant in Myanmar. The new gas-fired \nplant will ensure system stability and reliability, and help to avoid future shortages in power \ngeneration capacity. The plant will not be affected by seasonal weather patterns, and will be \nlocated closer to Myanmar\u2019s main load center than the hydroelectric power plants. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department was engaged early in the bidding process \nto  ensure  that  bidders  had  the  opportunity  to  optimize  their  proposals  by  leveraging  the \ninvolvement of international financial institutions, like ADB, in the nascent financial environment \nof  Myanmar,  where  commercial  long-term  funding  is  still  extremely  scarce  and  perceived \npolitical risk is high. ADB reached out to the short-listed bidders after the first round to explore \npotential assistance with them. The transparent bidding process resulted in a competitive and \nsustainable tariff for the government in the final round. Sembcorp Utilities Pte. Ltd. (SCU), the \nwinning bidder, was among those that expressed a strong interest in ADB financial assistance, \nincluding an A loan, a B loan, and a PRG, to support their bid. \n \n2.  Project Design \n6.  The project is a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer (BOT), PPP transaction for a combined-cycle, \nnatural gas power plant with a net capacity of 225 MW to be located in Myingyan, approximately \n500 kilometers (km) north of Yangon and 90 km west of Mandalay. The project has two phases: \n(i) constructing a 143 MW single-cycle gas turbine; and (ii) upgrading the turbine to a 225 MW \ncombined-cycle plant, following the completion of a steam turbine. The project company will \nenter into a PPA with Myanma Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE), a state-owned utility, and a \nBOT agreement with MOEP. Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) will enter into a gas \nsupply agreement (GSA) with MEPE to supply natural gas for use at the Myingyan power plant. \nMEPE will pay the value of the gas delivered directly to MOGE. The project will construct \nassociated facilities, such as (i) transmission facilities, including a 3 km transmission line to \nconnect the power plant to the nearby Myingyan 230 kV substation, which dispatches power to \nthe grid; and (ii) a 14 km water supply line from the river intake to the power plant. MEPE will \nbuild a 1 km gas pipeline to the existing pipeline.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n \n3.  The Borrower \n7.  The borrower of the project will be a newly created, special-purpose project company in \nMyanmar. It will be 80% owned by SCU, a leading developer, owner, and operator of energy \nand water assets globally, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sembcorp Industries Pte. Ltd. \n(SCI); and 20% by MMID Utilities Pte. Ltd. (MMID), a Singaporean company established to \npartner with SCU in this project (together with SCU, the sponsors).  \n \n8.  Headquartered  in  Singapore,  SCU  has  a  successful  track  record  of  operating \nindependent power producers globally, and has strong operating and technical capabilities. It \nhas over 7,800 MW of power capacity installed or under development, and manages more than \n9 million m3/day of bulk water supply capacity in operation or under development worldwide. \nSCU accounted for approximately half of SCI\u2019s profits in financial year 2014. SCI is listed on the ", "33  \n \nSingapore Exchange and had a market capital of S$6.5 billion ($4.6 billion) as of 29 October \n2015. SCI\u2019s largest shareholder is Temasek Holdings (49.5%), Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth \nfund. No other shareholder owns 5% or more shares in SCI. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n  \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n9.  The project will improve the reliability and stability of Myanmar\u2019s power supply, while \naddressing power shortages and helping avoid future brownouts. As the first competitive tender \nfor a power plant in Myanmar that adheres to international best practices and uses a model PPA \nprepared by an ADB TA, the successful financial close and operation of this project will set a \nprecedent for future tenders. Successful tenders and completion of more independent power \nproducer projects will help strengthen the regulatory and legal framework in the sector, and \nsignal growing stability to the market. The project will increase private sector financing for power \nthrough a PPP model. ADB\u2019s proposed B loan and PRG will generate long-term financing from \ninternational banks for the project, which will set an important market-based benchmark for \nlimited  recourse  financing  in  Myanmar.  These  are  aligned  with  the  government  target  of \nenhancing energy efficiency and conservation, and ensuring access to affordable energy. \n \n2.  Outcome \n10.  The project\u2019s outcome will be the increased provision of competitively priced, reliable \nbaseload electricity to address chronic power cuts and to allow for expansion of the grid. ADB \nwill play an important role in helping Myanmar expand its nascent power sector; the much-\nneeded  additional  capacity  will  come  from  modern  gas-fired  technology,  which  emits \nsubstantially less carbon dioxide than coal-fired generation. \n \n3.  Outputs \n11.  The project\u2019s outputs will comprise (i) the successful completion and commissioning of a \n143 MW single-cycle power plant (phase 1), (ii) the successful completion and commissioning of \na 225 MW efficient combined-cycle natural gas power plant (phase 2), and (iii) the completion of \nassociated facilities, including a 3 km transmission line. Myingyan is the first competitively \ntendered power plant in Myanmar according to international standards, and will be ADB\u2019s first \npower generation project in Myanmar since its re-engagement in the country in 2012.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n12.  Consistency with the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020. The project is consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which  identifies  inclusive  growth  and \ninfrastructure development as two of the four strategic priorities to sharpen the focus of ADB \noperations.7 Capitalizing on ADB\u2019s core strength of financing infrastructure development, the \nreview sets forth that ADB will continue to help expand the supply of energy, promote energy \nefficiency, and support clean energy. It aims to promote a larger role for the private sector in \nfinancing infrastructure development by supporting PPPs. The project is also fully in line with the \nreview\u2019s  emphasis  on  strengthening  private  sector  operations  in  Asian  Development  Fund \nrecipient countries, and expanding connectivity.  \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n ", "4 \n \n \n13.  Consistency with the country partnership strategy. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s \ninterim country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132014 for Myanmar.8 A needs assessment identified \nthe energy sector as a critical development constraint. The assistance is also closely aligned \nwith the country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017, which extends the validity of the interim \ncountry partnership strategy, and focuses on infrastructure investments in energy and PPP \nthrough ADB\u2019s private sector operations.9 \n \n14.  Consistency with the sector strategy. ADB\u2019s Energy Policy emphasizes investments \nin energy efficiency, least-cost supply, private sector participation, and wider access for the \npoor.10 ADB supports projects that use efficient technologies, such as combined cycle. Natural \ngas is a preferred energy source over coal for providing baseload electricity. The energy policy \nalso supports PPP models that enable the participation of the private sector to help achieve \nefficiencies and reduce reliance on public sector funds. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  Since 2013, the Myanmar government has promulgated several laws, such as the \nForeign Investment Law, to support economic deregulation and market liberalization. \nThe project was developed as a public\u2013private partnership and awarded a PPA \nthrough an international, least-cost, competitive bidding process with advisory support \nfrom the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation.  \nManagement  Project development, construction, and operation will be managed by the borrower, \nwhich is controlled by SCU and MMID.  \nImplementation period  January 2016\u2013November 2017 (commercial operation of phase 1 in June 2017 and \ncommercial operation of phase 2 in November 2017) \nConstruction arrangements   \nType of arrangement   The project will be constructed under a fixed-price, date-certain, turnkey engineering, \nprocurement, and construction arrangement covering all design, engineering, supply, \nconstruction, testing, and commissioning. Phase 1 commissioning of a 143 MW \nsingle-cycle plant is scheduled for June 2017; phase 2 commissioning of a 225 MW \ncombined-cycle plant is scheduled for November 2017.  \nContractor  Jurong Engineering, a Singapore-based company and a subsidiary of IHI Corporation \nof Japan, and subsidiaries of SCI and SCU will form a consortium. Jurong, SCI, and \nSCU have experience with similar project design and construction.  \nOperations arrangements   \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nOperation and  O&M works will be supported by SCU under a technical services agreement, and by \nmaintenance  General Electric under a long-term services agreement for the gas turbines. Both \nSCU and General Electric have a proven track record for O&M of power plants in \nseveral countries.

Value Added by ADB Assistance \n16.  ADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n(i)  As the first competitive tender for a gas-fired independent power producer project \nin Myanmar, the project is expected to mark a major milestone in the energy \nsector in terms of transparent and competitive bidding, long-term financing, and \nefficient technology. ADB\u2019s substantial participation will help demonstrate the \nbenefits  of  increasing  Myanmar\u2019s  power  supply  through  low-cost  PPP \narrangements, and signal to the government, multinationals, and international \nfinanciers that private sector-led infrastructure investments can be undertaken \nsuccessfully within sectors with sound legal and regulatory frameworks. \n(ii)  Due to the inherent political risk associated with investing in Myanmar, securing \nlong-term  commercial  bank  financing  necessary  for  large-scale  infrastructure \ninvestments  remains  a  challenge.  ADB\u2019s  early  engagement  and  ability  to \ncatalyze  long-term  loans  from  international  commercial  banks  are  important \nfactors in encouraging much-needed investment. \n(iii)  The project illustrates the synergy of ADB\u2019s public and private sector operations \nto undertake a PPP project from project identification and development to project \nfinancing  seamlessly  under  a  nascent  legal  and  financial  environment.  The \nmodel PPA prepared by the ADB TA was indispensable for the bankability of the \nproject, and ADB\u2019s private sector operations is taking a key catalytic role in \nmobilizing commercial financing. It demonstrates ADB\u2019s potential for combining \nPPP advisory and project financing to meet increasing infrastructure demand in \nAsia and the Pacific.  \n(iv)  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  help  support  an  alternative  to  coal-fired  generation  to \ngenerate significant power at competitive rates. The project will comply with ADB \nsafeguard requirements, which will ensure long-term sustainable operation of the \nproject, and is expected to set a new environmental and social standard in the \nenergy sector in Myanmar. \n \nC.
