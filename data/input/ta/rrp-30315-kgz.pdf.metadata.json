The Project will reorient the PVE\nsystem to improve quality and relevance of programs, internal and\nexternal efficiency, and financial sustainability; and broaden access\nfor all segments of the population, particularly out-of-school youth\nand  disadvantaged  groups.  The  Project  will  strengthen  support\nactivities such as accreditation, skills testing, and certification, and\nlinkages between primary vocational education institutions (PVEIs)\nand  private  industry  and  communities.  The  Project  will  improve\nentrepreneurship  training  programs,  and  support  activities  both\nwithin and outside the PVE system, including business incubator\n(internship  and  start-up)  services,  entrepreneurship  consulting\nservices for small business, and small business club networks.\nClassification Primary: Human Development\nSecondary: Poverty Reduction\nEnvironmental Category  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no\nAssessment significant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\nRationale The Government is faced with the immediate problems of increasing\npoverty and unemployment, and the medium- and long-term concern of\nskills development for economic development. Key reforms are needed\nin the PVE subsector to improve policy planning, management and\nadministration,  financing,  training  quality  and  relevance,  equity  and\naccess, entrepreneurship development, and involvement of the private\nsector in skills development. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has\nalready provided technical assistance (TA) to formulate a master plan for\nthe education sector, followed by the Education Sector Development\nProgram,  which  addressed  reforms  and  investment  mainly  in  basic\neducation. The proposed Project will be the next priority step in the\nGovernment-ADB development partnership.\nObjectives The overall goal of the Project is to improve the capability of the\nand Scope general population to obtain and maintain better means of livelihood\nthrough employment and self-employment, with particular attention\nto the inclusion of socially and economically disadvantaged groups.\nTo achieve this, the Project aims to (i) provide more relevant and\nhigher  quality  PVE  programs,  and  reorient  the  PVE  system  to\nimprove its efficiency and sustainability, as well as its outreach to\ndisadvantaged  groups;  (ii)  strengthen  entrepreneurship\ndevelopment  both  within  and  outside  the  PVE  system;  and  (iii)\nstrengthen  support  institutions  for  PVE  and  entrepreneurship", "iii\ndevelopment and support for project implementation. The Project\naims to improve public-private partnerships in these areas, involving\nGovernment, private business, industry, nongoverment organizations\n(NGOs), and civil society.\nThe Project will establish a labor market analysis system to link PVE\nprograms to market demand. The Project will upgrade and consolidate\n32 existing PVEIs into 29 model resource centers, and improve 70 other\nPVEIs around the country. Disadvantaged groups and out-of-school\nyouth will be targeted through outreach programs. Production facilities\nand  business  incubators  will  be  enhanced  both  as  part  of\nentrepreneurship training and for better PVEI financial sustainability.\nTechnical certification and accreditation systems will be established and\nadvocacy for policy reforms carried out through information, education,\nand communication activities to reach the community at large, PVEI\nadministrators,  central  Government  officials,  and  lawmakers.  The\nProject will establish two development facilities, one for developing and\nfinancing training innovations, the other for supporting PVEI production\nand entrepreneurship activities. A microcredit fund will be developed on\na  pilot  basis  to  assist  start-up  entrepreneurs  trained  by  the  project\ninstitutions.\nCost Estimates The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $31.3  million,  of  which  the  foreign\nexchange cost is $14.2 million (45 percent) and the local currency cost is\n$17.1 million equivalent (55 percent).\nFinancing Plan ($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nAsian Development Bank 14.2 10.8 25.0 80.0\nGovernment 0.0 6.3 6.3 20.0\nTotal 14.2 17.1 31.3 100.0\nLoan Amount A loan of SDR19.262 million ($25 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special\nand Terms Funds resources with a repayment period of 32 years, including a grace\nperiod of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1 percent per annum during\nthe grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2006\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP)\nImplementation The Project will be implemented by the Department for Vocational Training\nArrangements and  Education  (DVTE)  under  MLSP.  A  multisectoral  project  steering\ncommittee that will include private sector representation will provide policy\nand  operational  guidance  to  DVTE  during  all  phases  of  project\nimplementation, and maintain private sector cooperation.", "iv\nProcurement All procurement to be financed from the proceeds of the loan will be carried\nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nConsulting The Project will provide 230 person-months of international consulting,\nServices including 144 person-months of international volunteers, and in addition,\n475 person-months of domestic consulting.\nAll international consultants will be selected and engaged through a firm\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic\nconsultants.\nEstimated Project The Project will be implemented over five years, until 31 December 2005\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits The Project will improve not only the skills of the country\u2019s economically active\nand Beneficiaries segment of the labor force but also the capacity of unemployed and out-of-\nschool  youth  and  adults  to  seek  livelihood  through  better  skills  and\nentrepreneurship.  This  will  reduce  overall  unemployment  and  provide  the\ncountry with a better skilled and more productive labor force in support of the\nGovernment\u2019s economic transition efforts. Educational benefits include the\nreorientation of the PVE system to be more responsive to market demand and\nthe improvement of training curricula and programs, instructional materials,\nand school facilities and equipment. The reorientation will also make the\nnationwide  PVE  network  more  efficient  and  sustainable.  The  Project  will\nincrease the sense of partnership between the Government and the private\nsector (namely, industry and business, NGOs, and civil society) in skills and\nentrepreneurship development. Direct beneficiaries will be the students and\ngraduates of the formal PVE system, the new entrepreneurs developed by the\nproject facilities. The Project will have specific outreach programs targeting\nvulnerable groups such as students from poor families (as identified by the\nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  monitoring  surveys),  orphans  and  single-parent\nchildren, handicapped children, and refugees. An estimated 67,000 students\nand 32,000 graduates will benefit directly from the Project over its five-year\nlifetime, of whom about 38 percent come from the vulnerable groups and\nabout 34 percent are females. The Project will also directly benefit about\n212 administrators and policymakers; 112 PVEI directors and head teachers;\nand 2,041 teachers, instructors, and administrative staff nationwide who are\nworking in the formal PVE system.\nTechnical TA  grant  of  $600,000  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the\nAssistance Government of Japan, to improve the enabling environment for skills and\nentrepreneurship development accompanies the Project. The TA will help\npolicymakers  with  policy-level  strategic  planning  in  both  international  and\nCentral Asian contexts, and recommend improvements to the Government.", "1\nI.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Skills and Entrepreneurship Development Project. The report\nalso describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Improving the Enabling Environment for\nSkills and Entrepreneurship Development, and if the proposed loan is approved by the Board, I,\nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the TA.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. At the request of the Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved TA1 in\n1998  to  review  the  existing  situation  in  formal  and  nonformal  skills2  training  and\nentrepreneurship development in the country and assist the Government in preparing a skills\nand entrepreneurship development project. The TA was implemented in close collaboration with\nthe Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP), and in a highly participatory manner,\nconsulting stakeholder groups such as central and local government agencies, external aid\nagencies, schools and training institutions, private employers, nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs),  teachers,  principals,  and  communities  at  large.  A  rapid  social  assessment  was\nundertaken as part of the TA and additional poverty assessments were conducted during loan\nfact-finding in February-March 2000 and loan appraisal. The Appraisal Mission3 visited the\nKyrgyz Republic from 2 to 23 June 2000. This report is based on the findings of the TA,\nsubsequent consultations with the stakeholder groups, and the Mission findings. The project\nframework is in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Socioeconomic Context\n3. Since  independence  in  December  1991,  the  Government  has  embarked  on  a\ndetermined approach to transform the economy to a market-based system. After persistent\neconomic  contraction  from  1991  to  1995,  a  significant  turnaround  in  macroeconomic\nperformance was achieved in 1996, only to be set back again severely4 by the economic crisis\nof the Russian Federation that broke out in August 1998. Meanwhile, income inequality appears\nto be increasing dramatically (para. 7). Inflation increased about 27 percent in the first half of\n1999 compared with 12 percent the previous year, largely due to the weak currency, which\ndepreciated from an average of about Som21 to the dollar in 1998 to about Som41.5 in May\n1999.5 Faced with this deteriorating economic situation, the Government reached an agreement\nwith the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on revising the enhanced structural adjustment\nfacility program approved by the IMF board in February 1999. The policy package under the\nrevised  program  has  two  main  components:  tightening  fiscal  and  monetary  policies,  and\n                                                \n1  TA 3084-KGZ: Skills and Entrepreneurship Development, for $600,000, approved on 5 October 1998.\n2  The TA examined skill areas known to be important for the Kyrgyz economy, including the areas of agriculture and\nagro-processing,  building  and  construction,  electrical  and  mechanical  trades,  light  industry,  electronics  and\ninformation technology, services (financial, tourism, food services, personal care), and arts and handicrafts.\n3  The Mission comprised M. P. Perlas, Mission Chief; P. Kamayana, Programs Officer; E. C. Sison, Education\nDevelopment Specialist (staff consultant); and J. Cortes, Microentrepreneurship and Microfinance Specialist (staff\nconsultant).\n4 Real gross domestic product grew by only 1.4 percent in 1998 and 0.4 percent in the first half of 1999 compared\nwith 7.1 percent in 1996 and 9.9 percent in 1997.\n5 At present, $1.00 = Som47.6.", "2\naccelerating and strengthening structural reforms. Meanwhile, the country continues to confront\nserious  deterioration  of  education  and  health  infrastructure,  high  unemployment  and\nunderemployment, and sharp declines in income and social protection payments.\n4. According to the preliminary results of the April 1999 census, the population is now\nabout 4.8 million with a growth rate of 1.5 percent. About 2.5 million (51 percent) are female and\n1.8 million (39 percent) are children under the age of 16. About 3.2 million (66 percent) live in\nrural areas, an increase from about 62 percent from 1990. This increase is principally due to\nmigration  to  rural  areas  as  large  state  enterprises  ceased  production  in  urban  areas  and\nemigration of urban citizens to other countries.6 Social indicators for the Kyrgyz Republic are\nprovided in Appendix 2.\n5. As of January 1998 (latest available information), the working age population7 was\nestimated at 51 percent of the total population. The labor force participation rate declined from\n65.2 percent in 1997 to 60.0 percent in 1998.8 In the same period, the unemployment rate\nincreased from 5.7 to 5.9 percent of the economically active population.9 This figure does not\ntake into account the level of underemployment10 which in 1998 was estimated to be as high as\n28.5 percent. The proportion of women in the labor force declined from 51 percent in 1992 to 47\npercent in 1998. Because of a relatively young population mix, the labor force has grown from\n2.26 million in 1992 to 2.35 million in 1998. Meanwhile, the employed population decreased\nfrom 1.84 million in 1992 to 1.70 million in 1998.11 The number of unemployed registered with\nMLSP\u2019s Department of Employment Services (DES) dramatically increased from 1,800 in 1992\nto 55,900 in 1998, reaching a peak of 77,200 in 1996. The rural oblasts (provinces) of Jalal-\nAbad, Naryn, Talas and Yssyk Kul had higher rates of increase in unemployment than the urban\nareas  of  Bishkek,  Chui,  and  Osh.  Women  comprised  about  58  percent  of  the  registered\nunemployed in 1998.\n6. The human development index (HDI)12 of the Kyrgyz Republic declined from 0.715 in\n1992 to 0.698 in 1998, reaching its lowest point of 0.676 in 1995. This places the country in the\nmiddle HDI level internationally. The country\u2019s HDI ranking has decreased from 82nd in 1992 to\n113th in 1998.13 Among the three basic HDI indicators, educational attainment has remained\nrelatively the most stable during 1992-1998, while real per capita gross domestic product (GDP)\n(1992  prices)  declined  steeply  during  1992-1995,  by  as  much  as  26  percent  annually.\n                                                \n6  Migration reached a peak in 1993 and has been decreasing ever since.\n7  Working age is defined as 16-59 years for males and 16-54 for women.\n8  In 1992, the labor force participation rate was 81.3 percent.\n9  To be defined as unemployed, a person must be jobless throughout the year and have declared to the census\ninterviewer that he or she has actively looked for a job (economically active). Also, according to the Law on\nEmployment, farm dwellers and their families are considered employed because every villager is allotted a piece of\nland, and does not fall under the category of unemployed even if in fact he/she does not have a job.\n10 People are defined as underemployed if they declare to the census interviewer that they worked during certain\nparts of the year but either were found unemployed during the time of interview or indicate that they were without\npaid work during parts of the year.\n11 The numbers of employed reached a low of 1.64 million in 1995, and has since been steadily increasing.\n12 The HDI, as measured by United Nations Development Programme in the 1999 Kyrgyzstan Human Development\nReport, is a weighted index of three basic indicators: (i) longevity as measured by life expectancy at birth; (ii)\neducational attainment as measured by adult literacy (for people aged 15 years or older), and the percentage of\nchildren and young adults (aged 7-24 years) enrolled in the education system; and (iii) standard of living as\nmeasured by real GDP per capita.\n13 In 1997, the Kyrgyz Republic ranked 107th among 193 countries, compared with the other Central Asian republics\nof Kazakhstan (93rd), Tajikistan (115th), Turkmenistan (85th), and Uzbekistan (100th).", "3\nDifferences between the country\u2019s HDI and gender development index14 have remained small\nand stable over the past years (1996-1998). This is largely due to the comparatively high level\nof education for women in the country. On the other hand, women\u2019s share of earned income\nwas low.\n7. Since 1996, poverty levels in the Kyrgyz Republic are being monitored regularly through\nsurveys  by  the  National  Statistical  Committee  (Natstatcom),  namely  the  Kyrgyz  poverty\nmonitoring survey and the living standards measurement survey. Two poverty lines are defined:\nthe food poverty line, which characterizes the \u201cextremely poor,\u201d and the general poverty line\nwhich characterizes the \u201cpoor.\u201d15 The proportion of poor people was stable at about 51 percent\nin 1996 and 1997, but increased to about 64 percent in 1998, most likely due to the effects of\nthe economic crisis in the Russian Federation. The proportion of extremely poor, which had\nimproved from about 19 percent in 1996 to 15 percent in 1997, deteriorated to 23 percent in\n1998.\n8. Poverty appears to be predominantly a rural issue. An estimated 80 percent of the poor\nlive in rural areas, and the gap between urban and rural areas appears to be growing. By\ngeographic area in 1998, only Bishkek City and Chui oblast had populations that were less than\n50 percent poor; the other oblasts all had over 60 percent poor, with Naryn having the highest at\nabout 90 percent. The proportion of extremely poor was less than 10 percent in the urban areas\nof Bishkek, Osh, and Chui, but more than 20 percent in the rural areas, with Naryn having the\nhighest proportion at about 59 percent. Income inequality has also worsened. In 1993, the\npoorest 20 percent of the country gained 11.5 percent of all income. In 1998, this share dropped\nto 4.7 percent.\n9. The structure of employment has changed drastically during 1992-1998, mainly due to\nthe  downsizing  and  closure  of  state-owned  enterprises.  In  1992,  about  60  percent  of\nemployment was in state bodies (comprising both state-owned enterprises and central and local\ngovernment agencies) and 9 percent in collective farms. By 1998, state bodies employed less\nthan 30 percent, and collective farms about 1 percent of the working population. Employment\nhas been moving to individual farming (increasing from 16.5 percent to 35.1 percent) and joint-\nstock companies (from nil to 11 percent). Self-employment rose from virtually nil in 1992 to 8\npercent  in  1998.  A  significant  yet  unquantifiable  employment  source  is  the  informal  labor\nmarket, e.g., shuttle traders, baby-sitters, and intermediaries. Of the 1.7 million employed in\n1998, the top five sector employers were agriculture (48.8 percent), trade and public catering\n(10.4 percent), industry (9.8 percent), education (8.2 percent), and public health (5.5 percent).\n10. The Kyrgyz Republic continues to face severe social and economic difficulties. Although\nthe  economy  is  recovering  slowly,  some  of  the  main  problems  faced  include  increasing\nunemployment, underemployment, and poverty largely due to general production decline and\nscaling down of state enterprises. The Government addresses its problems of unemployment\nand underemployment through DES, which is responsible for employment centers throughout\nthe country where the unemployed register for possible jobs. DES arranges for upgrading and\nretraining of job seekers in cooperation with proximate institutions and employers. In 1999,\nMLSP estimated that about 173,300 people were unemployed16 in the country. Of these, about\n                                                \n14 The same indicators for HDI are used to measure the gender development index, the only difference is that\nindexes are adjusted in accordance with the differences for these indicators between men and women.\n15 The food poverty line is the level of per capita consumption for each household below which, even if all resources\nwere devoted to food, the minimum caloric requirement could not be met. The general poverty line represents the\nminimum level of consumption taking into account both food and nonfood basic needs.\n16 This included 48,400 people laid off by state agencies and 13,300 employed part-time.", "4\n62,200 were registered with DES; DES found jobs for 23,800 and arranged training for 6,500\n(about 14 percent more than in 1998).\n11. There  is  also  a  serious  mismatch  between  skill  supply  and  labor  market  demand.\nAlthough  substantial  information  on  the  labor  market  and  employment  is  being  gathered\nregularly by Natstatcom (since independence) and the National Observatory of Kyrgyzstan\n(since 1998),17 no regular consolidated labor market and skills needs analysis exists. There is\nno national employment strategy. Furthermore, a large part of the workforce needs retraining\nand upgrading to be able to meet contemporary skill needs arising from the changing nature of\nemployment. Thus the technical and pedagogical content of courses at technical and vocational\ninstitutions and schools must be adapted to changes in the structure of labor market demands.\nBecause of lack of employment opportunities, an increasing part of the population is seeking\nlivelihood through self-employment, mostly in the informal sector. Because capitalist activities\nwere discouraged during the Soviet years, entrepreneurship abilities are generally low and\nthese abilities need to be developed among the population at large, and the legislative and\ntaxation infrastructure improved for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).\n2.  General Education\n12. The formal education system of the Kyrgyz Republic (Appendix 3) includes preschooling,\ngeneral  schooling  (primary,  basic  secondary,  complete  secondary),  primary  and  further\nvocational education and training, and higher education. Preschool education is available in day\nnurseries (for 1.5-3 years of age) and kindergartens (3-7 years of age). Primary education\n(grades 1-4, age 6-11), basic secondary education (grades 5-9, age 11-15), and complete\nsecondary education (grades 10-11, age 15-18) are offered in various types of institutions:\nregular schools, grammar schools, lyceums,18 and specialized schools that have additional\nfocus on particular subjects. In school year 1999/2000 (SY2000), a total of about 1.1 million\nstudents attended 1,941 schools, all under the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture\n(MESC).\n13. The Government has made significant progress in developing the general education\nsubsector.  In  1995,  the  Government  requested  ADB  assistance19  with  conducting  a\ncomprehensive review and developing a national master plan for education and training, and\nthen  preparing  a  project  to  address  the  identified  Government\u2019s  priorities.  This  led  to  the\napproval of the ongoing ADB-funded Education Sector Development Program (ESDP)20 that\nfocuses on reforms and investments in basic education.21 The reforms pertain to three key\npolicy areas: (i) sector sustainability and efficiency, by rationalizing the existing system of\nresource mobilization for basic education and the cadre of teaching and administrative staff, as\nwell as promoting private sector participation in education; (ii) quality and relevance of basic\neducation by reforming curricula, textbooks, learning materials, and student assessment and\nschool evaluation; and (iii) access to and equity in preschool and basic education by formulating\na national strategy to address the declining level of preschool services, rationalizing early\n                                                \n17The National Observatory of Kyrgyzstan is part of a network of institutions established by the European Training\nFoundation, an agency of the European Union, with the aim of developing an information base on vocational\ntraining and its best practices in general, and on vocational training reform in the partner countries in particular (in\nCentral and Eastern Europe and in Central Asia).\n18 Lyceums offer a combination of general and vocational education subjects.\n19TA 2290-KGZ: Education and Training Master Plan, for $900,000, approved on 17 January 1995.\n20Loan 1554/1555-KGZ: Education Sector Development Program, for $32.7 million, approved on 29 September\n1997.\n21Basic education refers to grades 1-11.", "5\nchildhood education provision, and providing assistance and funding for disadvantaged groups.\nInvestments under the ESDP, all addressing basic education, include curriculum and textbook\nimprovements,  teacher  development,  improvement  of  the  education  delivery  network,  and\ncapacity building and resource mobilization. The ESDP included TA22 to strengthen education\nplanning and administration at central and local levels. The ESDP also includes key catalytic\nreforms for vocational education and training (para. 17) and higher education to prepare the\nGovernment for future development activities in these subsectors.\n3.  Vocational Education and Training\n14. Primary vocational education (PVE)23 and further vocational education and training are\nprovided in 105 PVE institutions (PVEIs) under MLSP\u2019s Department for Vocational Training and\nEducation (DVTE). Technical vocational programs, with less emphasis on general education\nsubjects, are provided to about 22,600 students. The precursor of DVTE (before 1988) was an\nindependent body whose purpose was to provide professional skills training. From 1988 to\n1990, the Government attempted to place the PVE system under the Ministry of People\u2019s\nEducation  (the  precursor  of  MESC);  however,  this  arrangement  reverted  to  that  of  an\nindependent state committee in 1991 because the single ministry arrangement placed more\nemphasis on general education and undermined the ability of the PVE system to produce\nenough specialists for the economy at that time. After independence, the prevailing economic\nsituation called for PVEIs to assume more social functions, such as retraining the unemployed,\nproviding  skills  training  to  out-of-school  youth,  and  upgrading  and  retraining  the  adult\npopulation. At the same time, the transition to a market economy required new training in\nemerging  skill  areas  (e.g.,  finance,  management,  information  technology,  and\nentrepreneurship), as well as reorienting existing training programs to be more flexible and\nadaptable  to  the  demands  of  the  labor  market.  In  1994  this  dual  employment  and  social\nprotection role of PVEIs prompted the Government to place the PVE system under MLSP by\nestablishing DVTE. As a result, PVE is embedded, in a more generalized form, in the general\neducation curriculum of lyceums and specialized schools under MESC, at basic secondary and\ncomplete  secondary  levels.  Another  48  postsecondary  institutions  under  MESC  and  other\nministries offer specialized technical and vocational programs in their speciality programs.\n15. While the PVE system was included, in general terms, as part of the education system\nby the Law on Education (1992), a subsequent law passed in October 1999\u2014the Law on\nPrimary Vocational Education\u2014distinguishes PVE from the general education system and sets\nout in more detail its legal, organizational, and economic basis. The goal of PVE is to satisfy the\nneeds of citizens to receive labor training through education, the main components of which are\ninitial training, qualifications upgrading, and retraining of workers who have not had vocational\neducation. PVE curricula24 are implemented by PVEI directors based on national standards\npromulgated by MESC for education content, and DVTE for training content. Programs offered\nin PVEIs must be approved by DVTE and typically include theoretical and practical  training,\non-site  internship,  and  student  activities  on work attitudes and ethics.\n                                                \n22TA  No.  2879-KGZ:  Strengthening of Education Planning and Administration,  for  $930,000,  approved  on\n29 September 1997.\n23 PVE is the official term for the initial stage of vocational education and training offered in grades 10-11. In the past,\nit was referred to alternatively as vocational and technical education, or vocational education and training.\nAppendix 2 provides basic data on the PVE system.\n24The Republican Scientific and Methodological Center within MLSP is responsible for PVE curriculum development\nand training of PVEI directors, teachers, and administrative staff.", "6\nWhile the PVE law recognizes the importance of private sector involvement, currently only one\nprivate PVEI25 is operating, and cooperation between public PVEIs and business and industry\nremains ad hoc. This is largely due to the fledgling state of private industry in general.\n16. The entry point to PVE is after completion of grade 9 of general education. Basic PVE\nsubjects may be embedded in the general education system under MESC (i.e., offered in\ngrades 10-11 or in three-year programs in lyceums or specialized secondary schools with the\ngraduate having an option to continue for higher education). Vocational and technical subjects\nare offered with more depth of treatment and more practical, hands-on training in PVEIs, in\nwhich case the graduate enters the labor market after a two- or three-year program.\n17. The ESDP included key catalytic reforms for the PVE system, namely, developing a\nstrategic plan for reorienting PVE, establishing a national training board (NTB) to assume\nresponsibility for policy and planning of PVE and promote links with business and industry, and\nestablishing a task force to develop specific policies regarding private sector involvement in\nPVE  delivery.  The  plan  for  reorienting  PVE  was  developed  under  the  skills  and\nentrepreneurship  development  TA  (footnote  1)  and  will  be  implemented  by  the  Project.  A\nmultisectoral NTB and task force were established; however, both were rendered inactive by\nfrequent changes at senior levels of Government. The NTB and task force were combined into\nthe project steering committee for the TA and the proposed Project (paras. 57 and 77).\n18. The responsibility for policy, planning, and national level administration of PVE now rests\nwith MLSP, within which DVTE plays the central role in coordination with MESC on matters\nrelating to education curriculum requirements. At the oblast level, administration is maintained\non behalf of the central Government by akhims26 through the oblast departments of education.\nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) has significant influence on PVE policy and planning, as it plans\nand controls the budget according to key financial and training indicators submitted by DVTE.\n19. The  105  PVEIs  are  dispersed  throughout  the  country  with  a  total  of  about\n22,600 students and 2,200 teachers and instructors, giving a student-teacher ratio of about\n10:1. The gender composition of PVE students in SY2000 was 66 percent male and 34 percent\nfemale. The industrial courses where females are traditionally enrolled are sewing, personal and\nconsumer services, trade and public catering, and textile production. Enrollment in PVEIs has\nfallen dramatically since 1992 when there were a total of 115 PVEIs and a total enrollment of\nabout 51,000. During SY1999, the system had 8,250 graduates and 10,800 new entrants. The\ndecline in enrollment has been caused mainly by cutbacks in the central and oblast budgets\nsince independence. Many PVEIs were left to cover their own costs, resulting in PVEIs having\nto reduce their capacity, which led to sharp cutbacks in enrollment. Another reason behind the\ndecline was the general loss of interest of the population because of the perceived lack of\nrelevance  of  programs  to  the  emerging  labor  market  demand,  deteriorating  infrastructure,\nobsolete books and materials, low teacher morale, and generally falling standards.\n                                                \n25There are, however, an undetermined (and increasing) number of private training agencies that focus on specific\ntraining in high-demand areas such as computer and information technology, accounting and business, and\ntailoring, without offering the entire PVE curriculum.\n26The akhim is an appointed official who functions like a chief executive officer for the oblast or raion (district).", "7\n20. Apart from providing vocational education and training, the PVEIs also fulfil an important\nsocial protection role. Government policy (as stipulated by the PVE law and confirmed by the\nPresident  and  the  Prime  Minister  during  the  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive  Development\nFramework [CDF] Workshop on Poverty Reduction and Social Protection27 on 15-16 February\n2000)  states  that  PVEIs  provide  a  mechanism  to  equalize  employment  and  education\nopportunities  for  disadvantaged  groups.  About  one  third  of  PVE  students  come  from\ndisadvantaged groups such as the poor, orphans, children from single-parent families, disabled,\nand refugees. Full or partial subsidies are provided to \u201cbudget\u201d students depending on their\nsocioeconomic  status  as  determined  by  means  testing  by  MLSP\u2019s  Department  of  Social\nProtection. Budget students comprise about 80 percent of PVEI enrollment; the other 20 percent\nare \u201ccontract\u201d students, i.e., self-paying students or those on a short-term program for retraining\nor upgrading.\n21. Generally, the PVE system is short of funds. This is reflected in the reduction of the\nshare of public expenditure allocated to education in general and PVE in particular. The Law on\nEducation 1992 stipulates that such allocation should not be less than 10 percent of GDP, which\nhas not been possible under the prevailing economic situation. Due to insufficient levels of\nfunding,  PVEIs  have  been  compelled  to  innovate  and  generate  income  by  themselves.28\nHowever,  heavy  taxation  of  this  income,  which  includes  tuition  paid  by  contract  students,\ndampens the initiatives of many PVEIs.29\n22. Public expenditure for education as a percentage of GDP oscillated during 1991-1999,\nranging from 3.7 to 7.8 percent. However, the relative share of the education budget allocated to\nPVE dropped steadily from 12.9 percent in 1994 to 6.9 percent in 1999. Likewise, in real terms\n(1995 prices), total expenditures for PVE declined from Som105.0 million in 1995 to Som63.2\nmillion in 1998, a reduction of just under 40 percent. Public expenditure for PVE emanates from\nthree general sources: the central (or republican) budget, the local budget, and alternative\nsources (such as contract students and income generation). The share of central and local\nbudgets in the total expenditures decreased from 67 and 25 percent in 1994 to 62 percent and\n21 percent in 1998. The share of alternative sources increased markedly from 8 percent in 1994\nto 17 percent in 1998 as a result of PVEIs being forced by budget circumstances to generate\ntheir own revenues. Appendix 4 provides details on PVE financing.\n4.  The Nonformal Sector\n23. There is no official definition of nonformal education (NFE) in the Kyrgyz Republic,\nalthough its main features are that it does not lead to an official certificate of educational\nattainment, and that it is lifelong education generally available to all segments of the population\nirrespective  of  age,  gender,  or  educational  attainment.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  NFE  has\nbasically five forms: courses, seminars, circles, self-education, and media. NFE is provided in\nsix general areas: professional skill upgrading, medicine and psychology, legal, moral, religion,\nand economics. The country has substantial NFE activities conducted by both state and private\norganizations, largely unregulated, and responding to labor market requirements or popular\ndemand.  At  present,  more  than  250  NGOs  are  registered  in  the  field  of  NFE,  including\nthose  established under  projects of  multilateral and bilateral aid  organizations.  Depending on\n                                                \n27 The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the pilot countries being assisted by the aid community using the CDF approach.\nThe workshop was the first in a series of workshops convened by the Government for CDF planning.\n28 Some PVEIs report generating income adequate to cover up to 15 percent of their total operating costs.\n29 Taxation was 50 percent until July 1999, when it was reduced to 30 percent, the same taxation level as that of a\nbusiness enterprise.", "8\nthe subject and target group, NFE programs may range in duration from a few days to more\nthan a year.\n24. There has not been any comprehensive study of the status of NFE in the country.\nHowever, the National Observatory of Kyrgyzstan, in collaboration with the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the European Training Foundation (ETF),\nconducted a survey in mid-1999 of 63 heads of organizations involved in NFE activities and 50\npeople who have received NFE. The objectives were to assess the prevailing situation and\ndevelop recommendations for strengthening NFE to mitigate the impact of economic transition.\nThe findings include the following.\n(i)  Most people require training in fields related to economics and services.\n(ii)  The majority of NFE students were 15-28 years and achieved up to secondary\nlevel of schooling.\n(iii)  The most vulnerable groups of people (the unemployed, the needy, and the risk\ngroups such as alcoholics, drug addicts, invalids) obtain NFE courses in skills\nupgrading, medical/psychological, and economic fields.\n(iv)  The youth and the unemployed each comprise about 25 percent of all NFE\nstudents with risk groups comprising 14 percent.\n(v)  More women than men use NFE to find work, upgrade their qualifications, obtain\nlegal knowledge, and improve their health conditions. Men tend to obtain NFE to\nincrease their economic activity or acquire a higher status or position in an\nongoing career.\n(vi)  The majority that NFE plays an important role in reducing tensions in society by\nincreasing the individual\u2019s activities and improving employment opportunities.\n(vii)  Among the survey respondents, 48 organizations offered NFE with funding from\ngrants (25), student fees (9), the national budget (5), commercial organizations\n(4), noncommercial organizations (4), and credits (3).\n(viii)  For training that was free of charge, the dropout rate averaged about 27 percent.\nFor paid training, the dropout rate was about 7 percent.\n(ix)  NFE is less expensive than regular education, with international organizations\nand  NGOs  providing  courses  at  minimal  fees.  The  most  expensive  courses\naddress market economy needs.\n(x)  The largest source of NFE funding is grants from international organization and\nlocal NGOs.\n25. The survey recommendations include the need for (i) comprehensive national policy and\na legislative basis for NFE; (ii) improved cooperation among Government NFE institutions and\nproviders to avoid overlap and improve targeted programs; (iii) financially sustainable NFE that\nis not totally dependent on grant support; and (iv) applied research on NFE.\n5.  Entrepreneurship Development\n26. Given the decreased production and lack of employment prospects in most economic\nsectors, self-employment through entrepreneurship is now regarded by the Government as a\npotentially  promising  engine   of  growth  and  employment  generation  in  the medium to  long", "9\nterm. In 1998, over 27,000 SMEs30 were registered in the Kyrgyz Republic with more than a\nmillion workers. About 54 percent of the SMEs were active in Bishkek. In addition, close to\n50,000 agricultural  enterprises  and  90,000  nonagricultural  enterprises  were  active.  Since\nindependence, the annual growth rate of the SME sector (in terms of numbers employed) has\nbeen between 7 and 12 percent, and the percentage of self-employed among the working\npopulation grew approximately 10 percent per year.\n27. The  idea  of  starting  a  business  seemed  very  distant  to  many  of  the  respondents\ninterviewed  during  the  project  preparatory  TA's  focus  discussion  groups.  The  respondents\nlacked of understanding of the principles underlying entrepreneurship, such as business plan\ndevelopment, and marketing and sales strategies. More than 70 years of discouragement of\nentrepreneurial behavior is the major reason. Moreover, attention to improving technical skills\ninherited from the Soviet period is still prevalent in the PVEIs. Nevertheless the country has\nentered one of the most market-oriented reform paths among the Central Asian republics. Even\nthough some regions are acutely poor and many people have difficulty adapting to market\neconomic conditions, they have shown an understanding of the need to change.\n28. At the macro level, growth in self-employment has been generated by the country\u2019s trade\nagreements mainly with the Russian Federation, Turkey, and the European Union, and through\nthe establishment of special free economic zones for developing companies. Other Government\nprograms  include  the  establishment  of  the  State  Fund  for  Support  of  Small  and  Medium\nEnterprises (SFSMB) in 1991 and partnerships with international aid organizations and NGOs in\nentrepreneurship  development  projects  such  as  the  Small  Business  Development  Center\n(SBDC) assisted jointly by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United\nNations  Industrial  Development  Organization  (UNIDO),  and  various  microcredit  projects.\nHowever, these efforts are hampered by obstacles such as the absence of a comprehensive\npolicy on entrepreneurship development, an unfavorable tax code and legislative environment, a\ncumbersome system for permits and certificates,31 the prevalence of rent-seeking activities, lack\nof sources of credit, lack of reliable information for entrepreneurs on current regulations in the\nsector, and poor training in entrepreneurship and business-related subjects. Such inefficiencies\nhave fostered the growth of a large informal economy that has resorted to tax evasion; bribery;\nand informal, often usurious credit.32\n29. The overall high level of education of the population does not necessarily translate to\nentrepreneurial competence. Attitudes, work ethics, and service orientation are just as important\nin  developing  a  successful  entrepreneur.  Most  entrepreneurs  learn  on  the  job;  however,\nentrepreneurship training is available at the PVEIs as well as business support centers of\ngovernment programs such as those offered at DES and SBDC. In SY2000, a total of 76 PVEIs\n                                                \n30 Natstatcom has two ways of classifying an enterprise: by number of paid employees and by annual turnover\nvolume in som. Definitions differ depending on the type of business production or nonproduction (i.e., trade and\nservices). For production businesses, a microenterprise would have 15 or fewer employees or turnover of up to\nSom150,000; a small enterprise 16-50 employees or turnover of Som150,000-Som500,000; and a medium\nenterprise 51-200 employees or Som500,000 to Som2 million. For nonproduction businesses, the corresponding\nranges are (i) microenterprises\u2014up to 7 employees or up to Som230,000; (ii) small enterprises\u20148-15 employees\nor Som230,000-Som500,000; (iii) medium enterprises\u201416-50 employees or Som500,000 to Som2 million. If the\nnumber of employees and the turnover do not match a category, Natstatcom is free to determine the classification\nas it sees fit.\n31Entrepreneurs interviewed during the TA bewailed the fact that over 30 signatures are needed on various papers\njust to open up a small business.\n32Apart from moneylenders, informal financing from family and friends is a major source of credit. More than\n50 percent of entrepreneurs interviewed during the TA started their businesses by borrowing from relatives and\nfriends.", "10\nprovided entrepreneurship training as part of the full-time PVE curriculum to a total of 5,366\nstudents (about 24 percent of total PVE enrollment) in subjects relating to farm management\n(3,333 students), accounting (1,295), business management (247), small business enterprise\n(188), hotel and restaurant management (121), office management (98), and tourism (84).\nShort-term training was also provided to 451 adults in the areas of accounting (285), farming\n(87), SMEs (67), and business management (12). That same school year, there were 2,681\ngraduates  in  those  entrepreneurship  subject  areas.  An  estimated  40  percent  of  graduates\nstarted their own businesses.\n30. Notwithstanding  the  significant  number  of  students  enrolled  in  the  entrepreneurship\nsubjects, many PVEI directors fail to appreciate the importance of entrepreneurship training,\nand consequently do not take measures to develop their training programs and encourage\nstudents. This lack of vision and appreciation is compounded by the fact that most books and\nsyllabi are obsolete, and economics teachers need retraining relevant to a market economy. A\nnumber of externally funded initiatives33have been carried out to develop more relevant subjects\nwith accompanying textbooks and materials and to train PVEI directors and teachers both in-\ncountry and out-of-country. However, these initiatives have had mixed results. Some of the\nshortcomings mentioned during interviews with officials concerned included the fragmentation of\ninitiatives that led to lack of dissemination of successful programs  throughout the PVE system,\nand the inability to adapt the foreign programs to the Kyrgyz setting. Another factor influencing\nthe effectiveness of entrepreneurship programs is the attitude of the students themselves.\nInterviews with young PVEI students show that (as is to be expected for 17-19 year olds) very\nfew  aim  to  start  their  own  business  immediately  after  graduation.  For  the  unemployed\nundergoing retraining, the situation is different. Generally, these persons have matured and\ngained some working experience that can help them if they start a business. Many have limited\naccess to capital for a start-up, usually borrowed from friends and relatives.\n31. In  theory,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  good  fundamentals  for  the  promotion  of  small\nbusinesses, namely, active promotion and support by the Government, adaptable attitudes\namong a well-educated population, and relatively workable (although sometimes cumbersome)\nlegislative  infrastructure.  However,  in  practice,  the  business  climate  is  difficult.  During  the\nproject preparatory TA, focus group discussions34 were convened with local entrepreneurs in\nBishkek, and Yssyk Kul and Osh oblasts. Findings are as follows:\n(i)  Regardless of supportive government policy, legislative provisions, and advisory\nprograms supported by external funding agencies and NGOs, entrepreneurs face\nenormous difficulties in starting and sustaining a small business (para. 28). There\nare few business clubs or entrepreneur associations35 that could serve as a\nplatform for united action.\n(ii)  Business subjects taught in PVEIs are not regarded as relevant to the needs of\nmicroentrepreneurs.  Programs  quality  differed  widely  among  PVEIs.  The\nentrepreneurs feel that the problem is systemwide, from irrelevant curricula and\ncourses, to poor quality of teachers, to lack of appropriate instructional materials.\n                                                \n33 Sources of external assistance include the World Bank (through its Social Safety Net Project), the Danish\nInternational  Development  Assistance,  International  Labour  Organization,  and  the  German  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr\nTechnische Zusammenarbeit.\n34 A typical focus group comprised about 5-8 entrepreneurs with 10-140 employees, most of whom have been active\nfor more than two years. Some focus groups had representatives from PVEIs.\n35 The Rotary Club of Bishkek was founded during the TA, and interest among employers and entrepreneurs was\nenormous.", "11\nThe concept of business incubators, or internship programs, 36 has been actively\nsupported by externally funded programs since the early years of independence;\nhowever, the programs have not measured up to expectations in boosting the\nstart-up  of  microenterprises.  The  main  problems  identified  are  that  (a)  new\nbusinesses cannot survive the prevailing taxation environment and need tax\nbreaks for one or two years to stabilize growth; (b) business incubators are\nsubjected  to  the  same  tax  structure  and  many  have  had  to  close;  and  (c)\nbusiness support activities sometimes evolve into social support programs, and\nnew entrepreneurs are unable to cope with the business environment outside the\nincubators.  SBDC  provides  business  advice  for  a  fee  through  an  officer  in\nBishkek and one in each oblast, but the program\u2019s coverage is modest.\n(iii)  Typically,  entrepreneurs  have  difficulty  finding  sources  of  credit.  Due  to  the\nunstable banking environment, commercial banks are cautious in lending money\nto businesses that seem risky. Microbusiness poses a higher lending risk than a\nlarge company, and the entrepreneurs find banks to be extremely hesitant to\ngrant loans. There are other sources of credit such as SFSMB, the Financial\nCompany for Credit Unions, (assisted by ADB), the Kyrgyz Agricultural Finance\nCorporation  (assisted  the  World  Bank),  the  Foundation  for  International\nCommunity Assistance (assisted by the United States Agency for International\nDevelopment), and Mercy Corps International.37\n(iv)  The entrepreneurs provided mixed views of the quality of students produced by\nPVEIs.  In  Bishkek,  the  entrepreneurs  admitted  reluctance  in  hiring  PVEI\ngraduates because they lack the right motivation and training, and the current\nprogram  offerings  are  largely  irrelevant.  In  Osh,  however,  most  of  the\nentrepreneurs, particularly the farmers, had positive attitudes to PVEIs and their\ngraduates. The consensus was that PVEI training is too specialized and many\nentrepreneurs are willing to cooperate in influencing the design of curricula and in\nactual training. Under these conditions, they are also open to paying for their\nemployees\u2019 training.\n6.  Skills and Entrepreneurship Development Issues\na.  Ability of the PVE System to Respond to Market Needs\n32. The  PVE  system  at  present  is  mostly  supply-driven  with  little  regard  to  relevancy,\nemployability, or self-employability. PVEIs are told by DVTE how many budget students they\nmay accept; funds are allocated accordingly. DES augments data from Natstatcom and the\nNational  Observatory  of  Kyrgyzstan,  and  conducts  regular  surveys  and  data  gathering  on\nemployment and the labor market. It has no overall consolidating and coordinating mechanism\nto develop a comprehensive national analysis. As a result, some PVE programs are flourishing\nwith waiting lists of applicants (e.g., printing, tailoring, bank management training, computer and\ninformation technology, and English) where employment and self-employment prospects are\ngood, while other programs (e.g., building and construction, mining and metallurgy, electricity\nand energy, and tourism and handicrafts) are maintained well under capacity. This has led to\nlack  of  funds  to  expand  the  high-demand  courses.  A  regular  mechanism  needs  to  be\n                                                \n36 A business incubator provides the environment and resources for business survival and growth. The incubator\nconsists of both production and training facilities. Most incubators also provide on-the-spot consulting services to\nhelp the entrepreneur during the vulnerable start-up. Other facilities can be shared, such as conference rooms,\ntelephones, and computers.\n37 Apart from SFSMB and Financial Company for Credit Unions, the other programs have specific target groups such\nas the poor, women, and rural areas.", "12\nestablished to link PVE program planning to labor market signals. The Project will establish a\nlabor market analysis system that will be linked to PVE program offerings to make them market-\ndriven.\nb.  Quality and Relevance of PVE Programs\n33. A major defect of training programs is that they are inflexible and do not allow elements\nto be combined to suit individual needs or the particular requirements of future employment or\nself-employment.38 Nor do they provide a broad platform of basic skill and knowledge covering a\nwide occupational area on which different programs of increasingly specialized content can be\ndesigned. Program content is generally out of date, and textbooks and other study material\nneed replacement. Program curricula needs improvement and training methods expanded by\nincreasing  the  use  of  modern  training  aids,  and  developing  methods  that  use  information\nprocessing as well as information learning more effectively. While faculties are generally well-\nqualified,  their  knowledge  in  their  respective  fields  and  in  teaching  methodology  need\nupgrading.  However,  virtually  no  funds  are  available  for  teacher  training.  The  Project  will\nreorient the PVE system to provide more relevant and higher quality programs, along with the\nrequisite curriculum and instructional materials development, teacher training, and facilities and\nequipment upgrading. The Project will also provide funds for innovative PVE training programs.\n34. The target outcomes of programs are not generally expressed in terms of skills and\nknowledge to be mastered, but rather in subjects to be covered in a prescribed number of\nhours. There is no structure of standards and qualifications to which outcomes are linked. The\nonly controls in place are students\u2019 examinations, which cannot be moderated externally. A\nWorld  Bank  project  (para.  50)  introduced  methodology  for  developing  competency-based\ncurricula; however, only the nine model PVEIs set up by that project and their neighboring\nPVEIs have been able to avail of the methodology. No systematic mechanism exists for sharing\nsuccessful programs across the entire PVE system. Two centers share this responsibility under\nMLSP,  the  Republican  Scientific  and  Methodological  Center  and  the  Information  Center.\nCurrently both centers lack the institutional capacity for this task. The Project will provide\nconsultants and training to strengthen support institutions, including key units of MLSP.\n35. The TA consultants noted that the quality standards for some craft skills would be totally\nunacceptable in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. In this\nrespect, enterprises have an important role in insisting on high-standard output from training\ninstitutions, while enterprise managers themselves need training in skill-demand definition and\nenforcement of standards. The Project will establish a technical certification and accreditation\nsystem, and provide staff development and operational support to implement and maintain the\nsystem.\nc.  Efficiency of the PVE Delivery System\n36. The existing network of small PVEIs is inefficient, with an average enrollment of about\n200 students each. During project preparation, the Mission found that the majority of PVEIs\nwere running under capacity, some were operating at about 20 percent capacity. While some\nconsolidation may be desirable, the process must be undertaken with care and due attention to\nspecial factors. First, at least in rural areas, PVEIs have a social role. Their very existence\n                                                \n38 MLSP has been moving away from the overspecialization that was prevalent in Soviet times to more flexible skills\npreparation for future career mobility. However, former attitudes and habits are deeply embedded in the PVE\nsystem and improvements have been piecemeal.", "13\nprovides economic activity and employment, and they are vehicles of social assistance for the\ndisadvantaged. Second, the country is, on average, lightly populated, with some 23 people per\nsquare  kilometer,  and  distances  between  PVEIs  are  already  quite  large.  Under  present\neconomic circumstances, students generally cannot afford to pay for public transport to come\nfor daily training, nor can they or their families afford private transport. Boarding facilities are\nsometimes available, even if buildings are usually dilapidated. However, the system itself cannot\nafford to establish and maintain more boarding facilities. Third, the experiences of some PVEIs\nthat are self-sustaining shows that the existing network could be sustainable, particularly if PVEI\nphysical facilities are downsized to more modest capacity and operated more efficiently instead\nof being closed outright. Certain programs offered in several institutions could be consolidated\nin one PVEI if programs are sufficiently improved to attract participants from a wider area. Thus\nthe  PVEI  network  and  offerings  need  to  be  rationalized.  The  Project  will  (i)  carry  out  a\nnationwide  school  mapping  exercise  with  the  aim  of  addressing  efficiency  issues,  and\n(ii) rationalize the existing PVE delivery network into a combination of model resource centers\nand regular PVEIs that will optimize resources and programs, as well as improve sustainability\nand outreach to disadvantaged groups.\nd.  Financial Sustainability of the PVE System\n37. With diminishing public budget support,39 each PVEI is left to fend for itself. This is\nexacerbated by a 30 percent taxation of gross extrabudgetary revenue. As a result, enrollment\nis reduced, access to PVE is limited, and technical and teaching staff are reduced. Also,\nproduction activity has become a necessity for survival in many PVEIs; however, this should be\nregulated properly so that it does not have a detrimental effect on academic and training\npursuits. In view of this, financial and in-kind support of the surrounding community possibly\naugmented by external funding agencies becomes invaluable in the short to medium term. For\nthe longer term, sustainable sources of revenue must be developed for the PVEIs with the\nassistance of the surrounding communities, business, and industry. The Project will, as part of\nimproving  the  efficiency  of  the  PVE  delivery  system,  convert  excess  PVEI  capacity  into\nproduction  units  and  farms  (where  these  can  be  viable)  and  support  innovative  income-\ngenerating strategies among PVEIs.\ne.  Equitable Access to PVE\n38. The PVE system is not available to all those who might benefit from vocational training\nbut do not apply for it for reasons such as poverty and gender stereotyping. Since students\ncannot afford to pay for daily public transport, catchment radii are limited to a few kilometers.\nAlso, there is a tendency for poor rural families to keep children at home to take on family work\nwhile their elders are at school. Girls are more likely to be kept at home while boys go to school.\nOn the other hand, PVEIs are vehicles of social protection, and students from poorer families\nare given special assistance as far as the limited resources of each PVEI permit. A number of\nresidential PVEIs cater to orphans and youth who are physically or mentally handicapped.\nHowever, no special training facilities or equipment are available for the handicapped, and\nPVEIs  are  not  equipped  or  professionally  prepared  to  accept  handicapped  people  in\nmainstream training. Of the approximately 40,000 refugees of all ages from other countries, only\nabout 15,000 are officially registered and are thus entitled to attend PVEIs.40 The PVE system\n                                                \n39 The central budget has constantly been reduced. In mid-1999, the original budget was reduced by 10 percent.\nMeanwhile, payments from the oblast budgets are irregular and not subject to central control.\n40 Government policy focuses on training and retraining refugees to enable them to adapt to Kyrgyz society as soon\nas possible.", "14\nmust provide equitable access to these disadvantaged groups. As part of optimizing the PVE\ndelivery network, outreach programs will be piloted and supported by the Project.\nf. Linkages with Private Industry and the Community\n39. Private industry is currently weak; its links with the PVE system are inevitably weak as\nwell. Linkages take place at the level of individual PVEIs, and depend on the interest and\npersonal contacts of the PVEI director, e.g., getting experienced private practitioners and/or\nemployers  for  part-time  teaching  and  participation  in  examination  panels.  These  personal\ncontacts  come  into  their  own  when  PVEIs  are  trying  to  build  up  the  nonformal,  specially\ncommissioned training on which many rely, but community contacts in general are given more\nimportance than those with private industry. At the national level, employers have been invited\nand sometimes agreed to take part in developing national standards. However, the scale of\nstandard setting activity at DVTE is modest and there are no funds to pay for employers\nparticipation. More PVEI-industry-community partnership mechanisms are needed. The Project\nwill support the strengthening of private industry, NGO, and community cooperation with PVEIs.\ng. Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening\n40. Overall financial difficulty in the sector adversely affects DVTE\u2019s capacity to manage and\noperate the PVE system. Fragmentation of the education and training delivery system, with\nschools  under  MESC,  PVEIs  under  DVTE,  and  retraining  under  DES  further  weakens  its\ncapacity. The situation is not helped by PVE\u2019s weak public image, partly derived from the history\nof PVEIs being sources of trained blue-collar workers for large-scale industry and collective\nfarms, and partly from the perception, more or less correct, that the system serves a social\nprotection  role  and  accepts  students  who  are  not  suitable  for  general  education.  Internal\nmanagement rationalization and training for headquarters and institutional manager is clearly\nneeded, together with specialized training for technical staff involved in financial management\nsystems, training, and development, not only at DVTE but also in other MLSP units. Capacity\nbuilding and institutional strengthening will be included in the Project.\nh. Skills Testing and Certification\n41. No system or structure of national skill standards exists. Curricula describe what is to be\ntaught and the hours to be devoted to each component, but without any outcome targets. Under\nsuch circumstances skill testing becomes a rather arbitrary affair and each PVEI sets its own\nexaminations, without formal external quality control or moderation, although sometimes under\nthe observation of employers\u2019 representatives. The quality of examinations depends on the\nquality of the instruction, which is often adversely affected by the lack of training materials and\nequipment. Employers interviewed during the TA complained that they could not trust a PVEI\ngraduation certificate to reflect the actual level of skill competency. The Project will develop a\nreliable national skills standard system and the accompanying accreditation and certification\nsystems (paras. 33-35).\ni. Entrepreneurship Development\n42. The  entire  system  of  entrepreneurship  development  needs  either  strengthening  or\nreform, namely, the establishment of an overall policy framework; provision of training (both\nwithin and outside of PVEIs) in core and specialized entrepreneurial skills; provision of technical\nand advisory support for existing and future entrepreneurs; improvement of the taxation and\nlegislative  framework;  more  efficient  dissemination  of  fresh  business  information,  tax\nregulations, and credit sources; and stronger partnerships between PVEIs and surrounding", "15\nSMEs. Within the PVE system, there is a need to develop a standard curriculum design, retrain\nPVEI directors and teachers, update books and instructional materials, and upgrade facilities.\nProduction facilities at PVEIs can be used both as income generating units and as a training\nground for student entrepreneurs. A functional assistance approach for fresh graduates starting\ntheir  new  businesses  is  also  needed.  This  could  be  addressed  by  combining  business\nincubators and access to microcredit. A major component of the Project will address these\nneeds, including providing PVEIs with revolving funds41 for production activities and microcredit\nschemes for microentrepreneurs trained under the Project.\n43. Groups that should be especially encouraged in the field of entrepreneurship include\nthose that have strong potential for success, e.g., women,42 and those that most need a source\nof livelihood but are unable to find work, e.g., the long-term unemployed, the poor from rural\nareas, and the handicapped. According to the Bishkek office of SFSMB, less than 20 percent of\nall new ventures in 1998 were started by women.\nj. Developing a System of Lifelong Learning\n44. Despite the steady drop in enrollment over the years since independence, many PVEIs\ncontinue to insist that they have more than four applicants for every place. However, most of\nthese applicants likely are those who have failed to access the presently prescribed routes to\nhigher  education,  which  are  desired  by  the  majority.  At  present,  applicants  who  are  not\naccepted at PVEIs generally remain unemployed. Alternative approaches in NFE and lifelong\nlearning are needed for these applicants. Also, the support and cooperation of employers,\nNGOs, and community-based organizations are needed locally, regionally and nationally. The\nProject will provide support for nonformal training through business incubators and advisory\ncenters in each oblast.\nk.  Legislative and Regulatory Framework\n45. The existing legislative framework such as the law on private property, and the tax code,\nand lack of clarity of regulations for business start-ups, limit PVEIs\u2019 initiatives to develop and\nbecome self-sustaining. These limitations are unsuitable for a world of work where employable\nskills require more complex background knowledge and enhanced personal abilities such as\nproblem solving and autonomy, and where everyone has the right, and is encouraged, to pursue\neducational opportunities as far and as long as their interest and talents will allow. Also, NGOs\nand community-based organizations, which have an important role to play in skills development\nfor the local market, need an effective legislative basis for such activities. Legislation and\nregulations  relating  to  entrepreneurial  activities  and  entrepreneurship  development  hamper\nmore than help. In fact, legislative obstacles, licensing red tape, and onerous taxation are seen\nas the main reason why many small- and medium-size businesses are failing. There is a clear\nneed for reform and/or reduction of regulation in these areas.43 The TA accompanying the\nProject  will  address  the  need  to  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  skills  and\nentrepreneurship development.\n                                                \n41 These funds will be a one-time provision under the Project and will be sustained by the PVEIs thereafter.\n42 Experience in other countries shows that, apart from the developmental aspects of empowering women through\nentrepreneurship, women entrepreneurs fare better than men under similar circumstances.\n43 Areas that need attention are tax regulations for PVEIs that operate production farms and units as part of their\ntraining programs, and the idea of not-for-profit agencies and how they are treated under tax and licensing\nregulations.", "16\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n46. The Economic Development Strategy of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic up to\nthe Year 2005 is the Government\u2019s medium-term national development plan. Based on this\nstrategy,  the  Government\u2019s  Indicative  Plan  for  the  Years  1999-2001  stipulates  concrete\nmeasures for implementing the program to stabilize the economic and social situation. The main\ngoals  of  the  plan  include  ensuring  sustainable  growth,  decreasing  unemployment,  and\nimproving the living conditions of the population.\n47. Even before developing the medium-term national development plan, the Government\nlaunched several programs relating to skills and entrepreneurship development as part of a\nholistic  strategy  with  a  theme  of  human  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  employment\ngeneration. These include the Bilim (knowledge) Program and the Cadres of the 21st Century\nProgram both established in 1996, the National Strategy for Sustainable Human Development in\n1997, and the National Poverty Alleviation Program (Araket) and the National Program for Labor\nMarket and Employment (Emgek) both in 1998.\n48. The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the pilot countries being assisted by the aid community\nusing the CDF approach (para. 20). The Government\u2019s priorities for poverty reduction include\n(i) pursuing sustainable economic growth by strengthening the most important branches of the\neconomy,  especially  agriculture;  (ii) adopting  labor-intensive  approaches  to  employment\ngeneration; (iii) promoting enterpreneurship development throughout the country, especially in\nthe rural areas; and (iv) providing social protection to vulnerable groups. The priorities are\nbased on good governance, decentralization of administration to the rural governments at the\nvillage level (ayil okmotu), and stronger partnerships with the private sector and civil society.\nUnder the CDF approach, ADB, IMF, UNDP, and World Bank are helping the Government\ndevelop  its  national  strategy  for  poverty  reduction.  IMF  will  provide  support  for  the\nmacroeconomic framework and external debt management; UNDP, World Bank, and ADB will\nsupport different aspects of poverty, sustainable pro-poor policies, and governance issues,\nensuring that the national strategy is built through participatory processes. An ADB-financed\nTA44 is focusing on poverty analysis and critical targeted interventions, and the production of\nreports  covering  community  development,  children,  women,  a  labor  market  study,  SME\ndevelopment and microfinance, export promotion, fiscal decentralization, and anticorruption.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n49. Within  the  framework  of  the  Consultative  Group  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  ADB  is\nacknowledged as the lead aid agency for education and training. The ADB-funded education\nand training master plan (para. 13) has guided the Government's development programs in the\nsector,  the  first  phase  of  which  was  the  ESDP.  The  Project  is  the  second  phase  in  this\nGovernment-ADB development partnership. A third education project, included in ADB\u2019s country\nprogram for 2002; is to review the master plan and reforms undertaken under the ESDP, and\nbuild upon them to further develop the basic education subsector.\n50. Since independence, support for PVE has been broad, though fragmented. A World\nBank-financed  training  component  of  the  Social  Safety  Net  Project  (1995-1998)  aimed  to\nestablish adult retraining capacity, including the upgrading of nine PVEIs into model PVEIs in\nselected  specialization  areas.  The  World  Bank's  ongoing  Social  Sector  Adjustment  Credit\nincludes  an  employment  component  that  aims  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  active  and\n                                                \n44 TA 3458-KGZ: Support to the National Strategy for Poverty Reduction, for $600,000, approved on 14 June 2000.", "17\npassive  labor  market  programs.  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  fur  Technische  Zusammenarbeit\n(German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation)  has  assisted  in  providing  long-term  advisory\nservices to strengthen DVTE and selected PVEIs, teacher training, development of training\nmethodologies, and development of active labor market measures. The Canadian International\nDevelopment  Agency  is  assisting  PVEIs  in  Yssyk  Kul  oblast  and  supporting  twinning\narrangements between Kyrgyz and Canadian training institutions. The European Union\u2019s TA for\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States has assisted in setting up the National Observatory\nof Kyrgyzstan, and ETF is developing pilot training of entrepreneurship trainers. A number of aid\nagencies are active in SME development and training such as UNDP, UNIDO, ETF, and the\nSwiss agency Helvetas. A UNDP project is presently supporting the SBDC in Bishkek and five\nother oblast branches until 2001. Danish International Development Assistance has helped with\ntextbook  development  and  production  for  the  PVE  sector.  Appendix  5  summarizes  major\nexternally assisted projects in the skills and entrepreneurship development sector. During the\nproject preparatory TA and project processing, ADB missions regularly consulted with and\nbriefed  representatives  of  major  funding  agencies  active  in  vocational  training  and\nentrepreneurship development to ensure that the Project would complement and not overlap\nwith their activities.\nD. Lessons Learned\n51. ADB's experience with the ESDP has been satisfactory, with MESC as the executing\nagency;  experience  with  MLSP  during  the  TA  to  prepare  the  Project  has  likewise  been\nsatisfactory. In both cases, an important factor was the strong ownership both ministries had for\ntheir respective projects. This will be crucial to the success of the proposed Project. Another\nfactor  in  implementing  the  ESDP  was  the  frequent  changes  in  ministry  leadership.  These\nchanges  delayed  some  ESDP  components;  however,  the  problem  of  loss  of  institutional\nmemory and momentum of implementation was rectified through close monitoring by ADB staff.\nA similar situation was experienced with the NTB (para. 17), which has been reconstituted as\nthe project steering committee. Taking these lessons into account, the Project was designed to\nfoster  ownership  among  stakeholders,  and  close  monitoring  will  be  conducted  during\nimplementation whenever changes in key personnel occur.\n52. The Project design also took into account lessons learned from evaluation findings on\nother ADB projects45 involving technical and vocational education and training. One of the most\nimportant lessons identified by the evaluation studies was the need for training institutions to\nforge a strong partnership with the private sector, particularly to get management and teaching\ninput from industry people. The Project will incorporate several initiatives to strengthen private\nsector  cooperation:  advisory  boards  will  be  established  for  each  PVEI  comprising  school,\ncommunity, and private sector representatives (paras. 62-63), a development facility for training\ninnovations  will  encourage  private  institutions  and  individuals  to  contribute  curriculum  and\nmethodology  innovations  (para.  64),  and  information,  education,  and  communication  (IEC)\ncampaigns will advocate cooperation with the private sector and funds will be provided to\noperationalize  such  cooperation  (paras.  64  and  71).  The  evaluation  studies  highlight  the\nimportance of matching training programs with the skill demands of industry. The Project will\nreorient  the  PVE  system  specifically  to  address  this  need  by  improving  curricula  and\ninstructional materials, training trainers, and establishing a labor market analysis system that will\nlink PVE program offerings to industry demand (para. 61). The evaluation studies identify the\n                                                \n45 ADB. 1999.

The\nProject will reorient PVE programs to address skills demanded by the market, while maintaining\nthe  social  protection  role  of  PVEIs  by  strengthening  outreach  programs  (para.  63).  The\nevaluation studies point out that final-year students of the evaluated training projects were often\nwell-prepared for further studies and/or employment, but not for self-employment. The Project is\nstrongly oriented to entrepreneurship development (para 65). The evaluation studies cite the\nneed  to  raise  the  level  of  Government  commitment  to  support  technical  and  vocational\neducation and training. In the case of the Kyrgyz Republic, budgetary constraints may make this\nimpossible.  The  Project,  instead  of  fostering  reliance  on  government  budget,  provides  for\nimproving sustainability at the PVEI level by developing and strengthening production units and\nfarms, and providing a development facility to help PVEIs establish revolving funds for their\nproduction activities (paras. 68-69). The evaluation studies note that a one-shot approach to\ndevelopment of technical and vocational education and training should be avoided and instead\nthe focus should be on long-term involvement. For the Kyrgyz Republic, the Government-ADB\ndevelopment partnership in the education and training sector (para. 49), of which the Project is\nthe second phase, embodies this long-term focus.\n53. Some lessons learned from the experience of the World Bank's Social Safety Net Project\nare relevant. A core of resources has been built up at nine model PVEIs under that project, and\nthese will be used and expanded. The modular model for curriculum development will reduce\nthe necessary number of consulting person-months for the Project. The experience from the\nWorld Bank project shows the need to build an information dissemination mechanism from the\nvery  beginning  of  a  project.  A  plan  for  dissemination  of  the  expected  outputs  should  be\nelaborated for each activity. Experience from the entrepreneurship training and development\nprojects carried out by, among others, Danish International Development Assistance and the\nETF, shows the need to make a thorough adaptation of any study material that is imported from\nother countries. Mere translation, change of names and currency, and other cosmetic editorial\nchanges  are  not  enough.  These  will  be  taken  into  account  during  implementation  of  the\ncurriculum and textbook development activities under the Project.\nE. ADB's Sector Strategy\n54. ADB\u2019s education policy paper47 is being updated to incorporate lessons learned in the\nlast  decade  and  link  education  more  closely  to  ADB\u2019s  overarching  objective  of  poverty\nreduction. The current policy notes DMCs that suffer from a pronounced mismatch between\neducation and labor will need assistance to expand and improve secondary schooling, including\nstructural reforms of technical-vocational education within and outside the secondary school\nsystem, if they are to become more responsive to structures and prospects of labor markets.\nThe updated draft policy paper points out that while priority, in the interests of poverty reduction,\nshould continue to be given to basic education, skills development and higher education are\nalso important if a country\u2019s labor force is to increase productivity and acquire new skills\nrelevant in a competitive, globalizing environment. However, support for these areas should aim\nto increase the role of the private sector, strengthen government capacity to set and monitor\nstandards, maximize cost-effectiveness, and give special attention to equity of access for the\npoor.\n                                                \n46 The studies cited in footnote 45 point out that in most of ADB\u2019s developing members countries technical and\nvocational schools have the traditional role of providing economically disadvantaged or intellectually less-gifted\nyouth with access to high-quality and relevant training. This situation also prevails in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n47 ADB. 1988. Education and Development in Asia and the Pacific. Manila. .", "19\n55. Within  the  framework  of  poverty  reduction,  human  development  is  an  essential\ncornerstone of ADB\u2019s strategy.48 Investment in education and skills development must focus on\nmaximizing impact on the poor and vulnerable groups. In this context, ADB continues to support\nthe Government's education reform efforts that started with the ESDP, and in meeting the\ncountry's  requirements  for  basic,  technical,  and  vocational  education.  ADB's  1996  country\noperational strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic remains broadly relevant; however, it is to be\nrevised in 2001 in the light of changing economic conditions, ADB\u2019s new poverty reduction\npolicy, and lessons learned under the existing strategy. The main objectives of the strategy\ninclude enhancing the medium and long-term potential of the country by investing in human\ndevelopment to preserve the gains under the Soviet system, and reorienting service provision to\na market-based economy. Operational strategies include assistance for education and training,\nimprovements in the provision of public services including social services provided by local\ngovernments, and investment in rural finance. All these areas will be touched upon by the\nProject. In addition, targeting of vulnerable groups through the PVE system will be addressed by\nthe Project through outreach programs.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n56. The  education  master  plan  developed  under  ADB  TA  and  the  ESDP  are  major\nmilestones in policy dialogue with the Government in the education and training sector. While\ndialogue focused initially on basic education, a review of the PVE subsector was undertaken\nunder the ESDP to provide a sound foundation for reorientation and future development. Key\ncatalytic reforms in PVE included under the ESDP were (i) developing a strategic plan for the\norientation of PVE, including a needs analysis for institutional capacity and assessment of the\nexisting policy environment; (ii) establishing the NTB to assume responsibility for policy and\nplanning of PVE, and to promote links with industry and business; and (iii) developing specific\npolicies regarding the registration and operation of private PVEIs, including taxation, licensing,\nas well as curriculum/program and accreditation requirements.\n57. Experience with implementing catalytic PVE reform was mixed mainly because frequent\nchanges in MLSP leadership disrupted the reform activities. Policy dialogue during the TA to\nprepare the Project helped to mitigate the effects of the disruptions. The development of the\nLaw on Primary Vocational Education was a significant boost for concretely establishing the\nProject. Due to policy dialogue during TA implementation, the NTB was reconstituted into a\nmultisectoral body with three permanent committees, one for planning PVE policy, one for\nstrengthening  social  protection  of  the  population,49  and  one  for  overseeing  project\nimplementation. While curriculum/program requirements are being addressed progressively, the\ndevelopment  of  specific  policies  on  private  PVEIs,  taxation,  licensing,  curriculum,  and\naccreditation will be carried out under the Project and its accompanying TA.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n58. The Government is faced with the immediate problems of overcoming increasing poverty\nand unemployment, and the medium and long-term concern of providing skills for the labor force\n                                                \n48 R179-99: Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific. The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development\nBank.\n49 This covers programs and activities of DVTE, DES, and the Social Protection Department, all under MLSP,\nincluding social protection within the framework of ADB\u2019s Loan No. 1645-KGZ: Social Services Delivery and\nFinance, for $10 million, approved on 27 November 1998.", "20\nfor economic development. A competent, productive, and flexible workforce and improved self-\nemployment opportunities are critical, with a particular focus on the poor and vulnerable groups.\nThe existing PVE system does not effectively address these needs and has to be reoriented.\nKey reforms are required for skills and entrepreneurship development related to policy planning,\nmanagement and administration, financing, training quality and relevance, equity and access,\nand involvement of the private sector. Within the framework of ADB\u2019s overall education strategy\nfor the Kyrgyz Republic, the ESDP assisted the Government with reforms and investments\nmainly in basic education and dealt with PVE only peripherally by initiating key catalytic reforms\n(para. 17). The Project will directly address these needs, and is the Government\u2019s next priority\nstep in the Government-ADB development partnership within the framework of the education\nmaster plan. Poverty reduction is an important aspect of the Project, as the exclusion of the\npoor and disadvantaged groups in socioeconomic development will be addressed. The PVE\nsystem is traditionally one of the Government\u2019s vehicles to provide training to disadvantaged\ngroups to enhance their opportunities to seek gainful employment and self-employment. The\nProject has been designed to improve the outreach of PVEIs training programs, particularly in\nrural areas, and includes entrepreneurship development specifically to address this poverty\nreduction  objective.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  priorities  for  assistance  to  the\ntechnical-vocational education subsector (paras. 54-55).\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n1. Objectives\n59. The overall goal of the Project is to improve the capability of the general population to\nobtain and maintain better means of livelihood through employment and self-employment, with\nparticular attention to the inclusion of socially and economically disadvantaged groups. To\nachieve this, the Project aims to (i) provide more relevant and higher quality PVE programs, and\nimprove  the  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  the  PVE  system  as  well  as  its  outreach  to\ndisadvantaged  groups  by  reorienting  the  PVE  system;  (ii)  strengthen  entrepreneurship\ndevelopment both within and outside the PVE system; and (iii) strengthen support institutions for\nPVE and entrepreneurship development, and support for project implementation.\n2. Scope\n60. The Project will have the following four components: (i) reorientation of the PVE system\nto address the issues of quality and relevance of PVE programs, the ability of the PVE system\nto respond to labor market needs, the efficiency and financial sustainability of the PVE system,\nand equitable access for all segments of the population; (ii) microentrepreneurship development\nto address the need for improving entrepreneurship training programs both within and outside\nthe PVE system; (iii) strengthening of support institutions to address the need for capacity\nbuilding and institutional strengthening; and establishing accreditation and certification systems,\nand  linkages  in  the  private  industry  and  communities;  and  (iv)  support  for  project\nimplementation. The project components are described in the following sections (paras. 61 to\n73). In addition, a TA grant will be attached to the Project to improve the enabling environment\nfor skills and entrepreneurship development in the country.\na. Reorientation of the PVE System\n61. Rationalization and School Mapping. The country\u2019s entire system of PVEIs will be\nrationalized in terms of specialization, coverage, and outreach programs to be able to respond\nbetter  to  the  emerging  needs  of  a  market  economy.  Ongoing  mapping  of  PVEIs  will  be\nstrengthened to determine the appropriate mix of program specialization (in the context of local", "21\nneeds and potential) and coverage of the oblasts and raions. PVEIs will be improved to provide\nmore relevant and higher quality training in more appropriate areas. A labor market analysis\nsystem will be established and linked to PVE program offerings to make them market-driven.\n62. Model Resource Centers for Specific Specializations. The Project will upgrade and\nconsolidate 32 existing PVEIs into 29 model resource centers dispersed throughout the country,\nand selected according to training needs in priority specializations for the country and the\ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  selected  PVEIs.50  Appendix  6  shows  the  distribution  of  model\nresource centers and the criteria used in selecting the PVEIs concerned. The model resource\ncenters will, in addition to offering regular PVE programs, serve as centers for the development\nof  program  and  training  innovations,  and  dissemination  of  these  innovations  and  other\ninformation relevant to PVE. Curriculum programs and learning materials will be developed for\nthese model resource centers, and twinning arrangements will be made with foreign institutions\nto  encourage  exchange  of  technology.  Facilities  of  existing  PVEIs  will  be  upgraded  to\nprescribed health and safety standards, training and office equipment will be upgraded, and\ninstitution-based advisory boards will be set up for each model resource center comprising\nschool, community, and private sector representatives.\n63. Nationwide Improvements. Other PVEIs that are not designated to be model resource\ncenters will also be upgraded throughout the country based on their submitted business plans.51\nA total of 70 PVEIs will be improved in terms of facilities and equipment. Advisory boards will be\nestablished for each PVEI. In addition, the existing curriculum programs and learning materials\nwill be improved. This will include outreach programs to reach special schools that serve\ndisadvantaged groups, such as those who are physically and mentally handicapped. Also,\noutreach programs will be developed for towns built around large enterprises that have now\nclosed operations. Selected neighboring PVEIs are expected to be upgraded to carry out the\noutreach programs. Mobile training units will also be established within each oblast to bring\nteachers and demonstration classes to outlying PVEIs and NFE institutions on a rotation basis.\nThese units will be linked to model resource centers in the oblast.\n64. Development  Facility  for  Training  Innovations.  To  help  improve  the  quality  and\nrelevance of the PVE curricula, initiatives and innovations will be encouraged by the Project\nfrom other sources in addition to MLSP, DVTE, and the PVEIs (e.g., private institutions and\nemployers, NGOs, and individuals or groups of individuals). A development facility with $1\nmillion equivalent funding will be provided under the Project to assist in developing and piloting\ninnovations in PVE training. The facility will also provide support for IEC campaigns for these\ninnovations. Screening and selection of innovations to be funded will be done by a technical\ncommittee52  chaired  by  the  director,  DVTE.  Proposals  will  be  evaluated  according  to  the\ntechnical soundness of the proposed innovation, relevance to priority specializations, use of\nappropriate technology, development and implementation costs, beneficiary coverage, potential\nfor replication, sustainability, and potential for resource mobilization within the community and\nlocal government. Details of this development facility are given in Appendix 7.\n                                                \n50 Details of nationwide improvements of PVEIs selected for upgrading and the extent of upgrading required may be\nfound in the supplementary appendixes.\n51 PVEI directors have submitted a first round of their business plans and their corresponding programs with the aim\nto address skill needs in their respective areas, and improve the internal and external efficiency of their institutions.\n52The committee will include representation from the Republican Scientific and Methodological Center, experienced\nPVEI directors, and private employers. Subject-specific experts may be asked to advise the committee as needed.\nThe  exact  membership  and  specific  terms  of  reference  of  the  committee  will  be  finalized  during  project\nimplementation, subject to ADB\u2019s concurrence, as a condition of disbursement.", "22\nb. Microentrepreneurship Development\n65. This  component  include:  (i)  review  and  improvement  of  existing  entrepreneurship\ntraining  programs;  (ii)  enhancement  of  existing,  and  piloting  of  new,  business  incubator\nstrategies;  (iii) development  of  production  units  among  the  PVEIs,  establishment  of\ncorresponding  service  units,  and  piloting  of  service  strategies;  (iv)  development  and  initial\nfunding of revolving fund mechanisms to finance production activities; and (v) development of\nsupport services and piloting of a microcredit fund for microentrepreneurs.\n66. Improving Entrepreneurship Programs. The Project will review and improve the entire\nsystem of entrepreneurship training that exists at present within both the formal PVE system\nand the nonformal system of training being carried out by DES and other agencies, including\nexternally aided projects and NGOs. DVTE will ensure that inputs from the various sectors are\ncoordinated and consolidated into a comprehensive strategy. Entrepreneurial core skills such as\nconfidence  building,  creative  problem  solving,  and  innovative  thinking  will  be  introduced\ngradually into all PVE training programs. Teachers and trainers will be upgraded accordingly to\ncarry  out  the  training  programs  in  a  student-centered  way.  Textbooks,  learning  materials,\nequipment, and support mechanisms will be developed.\n67. Piloting Business Incubator Strategies. Experience with production facilities at some\nPVEIs has shown that financial sustainability can be improved by enhancing such facilities. At\nthe  same  time,  such  facilities,  coupled  with  business  incubators,  could  provide  practical\nentrepreneurship training and experience to students. The business incubators themselves\ncould  be  an  additional  source  of  income  for  the  PVEIs.  The  Project  will  improve  existing\nbusiness incubator programs and convert existing surplus capacity in PVEIs into appropriate\nbusiness incubators. The Project will also provide equipment and learning materials for the\nbusiness incubators. Additional innovations of business incubator strategies will be developed\nand piloted.\n68. Developing Production Units and Service Units. Existing production facilities and\ncapacity among the PVEIs will be enhanced, and new production units and farms will be\ndeveloped at PVEIs that do not have them at present. New production strategies and activities\nwill be piloted and successful ones implemented under the Project. Staff of PVEIs will be\ndeveloped to sustain these production units and farms. Expansion of production units will call for\nan efficient system to share (or lease) and service equipment and machinery. The Project will\ntherefore  develop  a  system  of  service  units  and  pilot  service  strategies  that  would  allow\nproximate PVEIs to share and service their equipment and machinery. The required staff will\nalso be developed under the Project.\n69. Development Facility for Production Activities: A positive effect of declining budget\nsupport to PVE has been the innovations adopted by PVEI directors to help sustain their\noperations. To support and strengthen these efforts of self-sustainability, the Project will provide\nseed funding to help PVEIs establish their own revolving funds for production activities. These\nrevolving funds will be replenished and maintained through the income generated by the PVEIs\u2019\nproduction units and/or farms. Block grants will be provided to PVEIs based on business plans\nsubmitted by PVEI directors. Business plans will be screened and selected on a competitive\nbasis by a technical committee53 chaired by the director, DVTE. Proposals will be evaluated\n                                                \n53This  committee  will  include  experienced  PVEI  directors  who  have  successful  production  activities  in  their\ninstitutions. Representatives from the particular community and local business and industry where the applying\nPVEI is located may be asked to advise the committee as needed.", "23\naccording to their rationale and justification, technical soundness, contribution to the PVEI\u2019s\npractical  training  program,  and  commitment  of  the  PVEI  to  sustaining  the  revolving  fund\nmechanism. The total amount to be provided by the Project will be $1 million equivalent. Details\nof this development facility are given in Appendix 8.\n70. Developing Support Services and a Pilot Microcredit Fund for Microentrepreneurs.\nSupport services for microentrepreneurs will be established under the Project such as IEC\nactivities,  business  consulting  services  in  each  oblast,  and  voluntary  business  clubs  and\nnetworks. Consulting services will include advice on business plan development, packaging and\nmarketing,  accounting  and  finance,  legislation,  and  human  resource  development  and\nmanagement. Business clubs and networks will be created to provide continuing education to\nentrepreneurs  and  strengthen  their  business  opportunities.  A  microcredit  fund  for  start-up\nentrepreneurs  will  be  piloted  under  the  Project.  This  fund  will  provide  an  opportunity  for\ngraduates and trainees of the PVEIs, who want to start a business, to borrow money after\nfulfilling standard requirements such as borrower training, preparation of an adequate and viable\nbusiness plan, and proper documentation. The Project will provide $1 million equivalent. The\nGovernment,  through  MOF,  will  onlend  the  funds  in  som  to  SFSMB,  as  the  financial\nintermediary,54 at nonsubsidized rates. SFSMB will onlend to subborrowers (individuals or in\ngroups) at a lending rate that would cover both MOF\u2019s onlending rate as well as SFSMB\u2019s\nadministrative costs, service fees, and provision for bad debts. Subborrowers will be required to\nsubmit an acceptable business plan to a technical committee55 chaired by the director, DVTE.\nThe technical committee will submit a long list of acceptable business plans to SFSMB for loan\nprocessing according to SFSMB\u2019s procedures. Details of the microcredit mechanism are given\nin Appendix 9. Details on SFSMB, its institutional capacity, and its credit experience are given in\nAppendix 10.\nc. Strengthening Support Institutions\n71. The Project will strengthen institutions in support of the above two components (paras.\n61 to 70). This includes policy review, and advocacy for reform through IEC activities to reach\nthe community at large, PVEI directors, policymakers at MLSP and other agencies involved with\nPVE policy and finance, decision makers in the President\u2019s Office and the Prime Minister\u2019s\nOffice, and lawmakers. Key units at MLSP and other agencies involved with the Project will be\nstrengthened through in-country and out-of-country training, provision of funds for systems\ndevelopment and operational support, and consulting services for key tasks. The Project will\nsupport  the  establishment  of  a  technical  certification  and  accreditation  system,  and  the\ndevelopment of staff, systems, and operational support to implement such certification and\naccreditation. The Project will also strengthen cooperation among PVEIs, local governments,\nand  the  private  sector  through  the  use  of  IEC  campaigns  and  the  provision  of  funds  to\noperationalize such cooperation. In particular, the Project will provide support for reorienting\nprograms for staff of DVTE, PVEIs, and local governments; linking DVTE and PVEI directors\nwith  industry,  NGO,  and  community  leaders;  developing  dual  training  and  industry-based\ntraining  mechanisms  to  involve  employers  and  industry  groups;  and  establishing  voluntary\nbusiness clubs.\n                                                \n54 SFSMB is a nonprofit state agency established in 1991 to provide support to SMEs by means of financing, training,\nand consultative and informational advice, and other services as needed. SFSMB has regional offices in each\noblast (except Batken) and has been providing credit to SMEs since 1992.\n55 This committee will include PVEI directors with technical experience in preparing business plans. Advice will also\nbe sought from specialists of the UNDP-assisted SBDC as needed.", "24\nd. Support for Project Implementation\n72. The Project will establish a project implementation unit (PIU) in Bishkek and a sub-PIU in\nOsh,56 to implement the project activities efficiently and effectively. Appendix 11 provides the\norganizational structure of project implementation. Key staff in the PIU will be on a full-time\nbasis and will include the project manager, a finance and administrative officer, a civil works and\nprocurement officer, and a consultant services and staff development officer. The sub-PIU will\nbe similarly staffed by full-time key staff; however, instead of a project manager, it will be\nheaded by a project coordinator who will report to the PIU\u2019s project manager. Each unit will be\nprovided with the necessary facilities, equipment, and a vehicle. Also, key PIU and sub-PIU staff\nwill be trained in project planning and management, and in ADB guidelines and procedures.\nConsultants for project and financial management, monitoring and evaluation, and midterm\nreview will augment the PIU staff. The Project will also provide the necessary funding for the\nPIUs\u2019 recurrent operational expenses under normal Government budgetary allocations.\n73. The development activities required for the Project are summarized as follows: Appendix\n12\u2014staff development; Appendix 13, consulting services; Appendix 14, textbooks and learning\nmaterials; Appendix 15, civil works; and Appendix 16, equipment and furniture.\nC. Cost Estimates\n74. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $31.3 million equivalent, of which $14.2\nmillion (45 percent) is the foreign exchange cost and $17.1 million equivalent (55 percent) is the\nlocal currency cost. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 17.\nD. Financing Plan\n75. ADB will provide a loan of $25 million equivalent from its Special Funds sources and the\nbalance of $6.3 million equivalent will be provided by the Government. The Borrower will be the\nKyrgyz Republic and the loan will have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years,\nwith an interest rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter. The loan will include financing of the interest charge. The Government and ADB will\nseek  out  possible  cofinancing  sources  for  the  Project,57  and  in  the  event  cofinancing\nmaterializes, the corresponding portion of the ADB loan will be reallocated to other project\ncomponents or canceled as agreed to by the Government and ADB. The financing plan is\nsummarized in Table 2 and detailed in Appendix 18.\n                                                \n56The geographic separation between north and south necessitates establishing the sub-PIU in Osh. This will\nminimize delays and frequent (and costly) commuting by PIU staff between Bishkek and Osh.\n57OWZ Bayern, an agency of the German state of Bavaria, has expressed interest in providing parallel grant\ncofinancing for the out-of-country training. OWZ Bayern has the explicit policy of supporting the democratization\nprocess and the move to a market economy in the transition countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, linking\nits training programs in these countries to about 70 training institutions in Bavaria. It has designed and carried out\nan ETF-assisted training of trainers program in the Kyrgyz Republic in 1999 for small business trainers and\nadvisers.  DVTE  officials  have  confirmed  that  OWZ's  performance  in  this  project  was  satisfactory.  The\narrangements for cooperation are being finalized by ADB\u2019s Office of Cofinancing Operations.", "25\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total Percent of\nComponent Exchange Currency Cost Base Cost\nA.

Executing Agency\n76. The Executing Agency for the Project will be MLSP.\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n77. The minister, MLSP, will appoint a project director who will assume responsibility for the\noverall execution and supervision of the Project, as well as the PIU and sub-PIU. A multisectoral\nproject steering committee chaired by the minister, MLSP, and including the project director,\nwith appropriate representation from various stakeholder groups such as DVTE; MESC; MOF;\nMinistry of Industry and Foreign Trade; State Committee for Foreign Investments and Economic\nDevelopment  (Goscominvest);  SFSMB;  other  government  agencies  as  appropriate;  private", "26\nsector (e.g., the Chamber of Commerce of the Kyrgyz Republic); and NGOs will provide policy\nguidance for the Project. DVTE, with guidance from the project steering committee, will be\nresponsible for coordinating and consolidating multisectoral views and inputs. The PIU will be\nheaded by a project manager to be appointed by the Government subject to the concurrence of\nADB. The PIU and the sub-PIU (para. 72) will be responsible for day-to-day aspects of project\nimplementation  in  their  respective  areas  of  responsibility.  To  ensure  timely  and  effective\ninstitutional response to project needs, responsibility for project implementation will be shared\nby various central and local agencies. DVTE\u2019s role will mainly be in policy coordination and\nplanning at the central level and overall supervision of the PIU. DVTE's oblast coordinators for\nPVE will assume a coordination and monitoring role in their respective localities for curriculum\nand materials development, facilities and equipment upgrading, and support activities. Appendix\n19 provides an implementation responsibility matrix for the Project.\n1. Implementation Schedule\n78. The Project will be implemented over five years beginning about January 2001. As soon\nas  the  Project  becomes  effective,  the  PIU  will  start  recruiting  international  and  domestic\nconsultants for the lead-in activities such as project management and finance, school mapping\nand rationalization, planning and development of model resource centers, planning of outreach\nprograms for disadvantaged groups, planning and development of entrepreneurship programs,\nand monitoring and evaluation. Also, detailed planning and implementation of staff development\nprograms under the Project will start. Rationalization of the PVE system according to the\nfindings of the school mapping exercise will commence in the second year of the Project, along\nwith curriculum and instructional materials development, implementation of entrepreneurship\nprograms, engagement of volunteers for curriculum implementation, finalization and execution\nof contracts for facilities and equipment upgrading, and implementation of the two development\nfacilities for training innovations and production activities, as well as the pilot microcredit fund.\nThereafter, the Project will be in full swing. The Project implementation schedule is included as\na supplementary appendix.\n2. Procurement of Goods\n79. All ADB-financed procurement will be done in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for\nProcurement. Appendix 20 summarizes the procurement packaging for the Project. Discussions\nwere held with the project director designate and the project manager designate on ADB's\nanticorruption policy and the need to ensure transparency and accountability in all project\nactivities. They were advised that (i) ADB will reject a proposal of award if it determines that a\nbidder has engaged in corrupt or fraudulent practices when competing for the contract in\nquestion; (ii) any expenditure incurred with or through corrupt or fraudulent practices will not be\nreimbursable; (iii) any firm or individual found to have engaged in such practices will be declared\nineligible for ADB-financed contracts, either indefinitely or for a stated period; and (iv) where\nsuch  practices  have  been  engaged  in  and  the  Government  has  not  taken  a  timely  and\nappropriate remedial action, the relevant portions of the loan may be canceled.\na.  Civil Works\n80. Civil works under the Project will involve the renovation and consolidation of facilities of\n32 PVEIs to become 29 model resource centers, small refurbishment of up to 70 PVEIs, and\nrefurbishment of at least 12 dormitories and of the main DVTE building in Bishkek. These civil\nworks components are small and scattered throughout the country and are unlikely to attract the\ninterest  of  international  construction  firms.  Therefore,  procurement  will  be  through  local\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  without  precluding  interested  foreign", "27\nbidders from participating. Contractors will be required to give appropriate warranties for their\nwork.\nb.  Equipment, Instructional Materials, and Service Vehicles\n81. To the extent possible, procurement will be arranged in such a way that each package or\ncontract award will be appropriate for international competitive bidding. Supply contracts for\ngoods  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of\ninternational competitive bidding procedures, and for goods with a total estimated value of\n$500,000 or less, international shopping procedures will be followed. Items costing less than\n$100,000  equivalent  (such  as  service  vehicles)  will  be  procured  under  direct  purchase\nprocedures. Major packages include machine tools, automotive repair equipment, hotel and\ncatering equipment, agriculture and agroprocessing equipment, construction training equipment,\nelectronic repair training equipment, textile training equipment, and computers. All equipment\nprocured will be appropriate for use in training programs rather than full production equipment.\nThe PIU will prepare lists and specifications of goods to be provided.\n3. Staff Training and Development\n82. The  Project  will  provide  a  total  of  392  person-months  of  out-of-country  training  for\n212 administrators  and  head  teachers,  and  2,195  person-months  of  local  training  for\n2,565 trainers, teachers, and administrators in curriculum and textbook development, local and\nregional administration of education and training, computer literacy, training skills upgrading,\norganization  of  distance  education,  career  guidance,  accreditation  and  certification,  skills\nstandard development, work health, and safety. The programs will range from one week to three\nmonths, and will be conducted at central and regional levels. Cofinancing of the out-of-country\ntraining is being finalized with OWZ Bayern.\n4. Consulting Services\n83. The  Project  provides  for  a  total  of  86  person-months  of  international  consulting,\n144 person-months of international volunteer services, and 475 person-months of domestic\nconsulting. The international consultants, with input duration ranging from 2 to 18 months, and\ncovering a wide range of specializations, will assist DVTE, the model resource centers, and the\nPVEIs covered by the Project in all aspects of training and development. The volunteers will\nwork on implementing curriculum and producing training materials. The domestic consultants\nwill  act  as  counterpart  staff  to  the  international  consultants  and  will  support  them  in  their\nassignments. The selection and recruitment of international consultants will be carried out in\nseparate packages through a combination of individuals and an international firm in accordance\nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The volunteers will be selected by the PIU\nthrough  institutional  arrangements  with  multilateral  organizations  (e.g.,  United  Nations\nvolunteers) or bilateral agencies under arrangements acceptable to ADB. Domestic consultants\nwill be recruited by the PIU under arrangements acceptable to ADB. The terms of reference of\nthe consultants are summarized in Appendix 13.\n5. Disbursement Arrangements and Imprest Fund\n84. All forms of disbursements under the Project will be carried out in accordance with\nGovernment and ADB guidelines and procedures. An imprest account will be established after\nloan effectiveness to expedite disbursement of loan proceeds. The imprest account will be\nestablished  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed\narrangements between the Government and ADB. The account will be opened by the PIU in a", "28\ncommercial bank to be selected according to Government and ADB guidelines. The initial\namount to be deposited into the imprest account will not exceed six months of project expenses\nand is estimated at $500,000. The PIU will prepare, in consultation with DVTE, MOF, and\nGoscominvest, the draft formulation of project expenditures for all activities for the five-year life\nof the Project, complete with estimates for each year of project implementation. These budgets\nwill be reviewed and updated every six months. All budgets will be reviewed and approved by\nMOF before implementation. Project expenditures will be recorded at source by the PIU and the\nsub-PIU.  The  PIU  will  approve  and  supervise  all  drawdown  arrangements.  Each  facility,\nrehabilitation contractor, and supplier of equipment and furniture receiving project funds will be\nrequired to open an account with a commercial bank into which the funds will be paid. ADB\u2019s\nstatement of expenditures procedures will be followed to liquidate the imprest account and to\nreimburse individual payments that do not exceed $50,000 equivalent.\n85. While the development facilities for training innovations and production activities are\ngoverned by their own specific procedures as discussed in Appendixes 7 and 8, the funds for\nthese development facilities will be disbursed according to the same guidelines and procedures\nas for other project components. Upon approval of proposals and PVEI business plans by the\nrespective technical committees, the PIU may use either the Project's imprest account or submit\nwithdrawal applications to ADB to release the required funds.\n86. The microcredit fund will be onlent by MOF to SFSMB in a phased manner as agreed to\nby SFSMB, DVTE, and ADB, according to the guidelines discussed in Appendix 9. The goods\nand services to be financed by the individual subloans will be purchased from ADB member\ncountries. The first 10 microcredit applications slated for approval will be reviewed jointly with\nADB by fax, electronic mail, or hard copy before final approval is given by SFSMB.\n6.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n87. The  PIU  will  prepare  and  provide  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  and\nprovide them to ADB within 30 days of the respective period. The reports will be provided in a\nformat acceptable to ADB and will include progress made against established targets and\nproblems encountered during the period under review, steps taken and proposed to be taken to\nresolve the problems, compliance with loan covenants, and proposed work program to be\nundertaken during the succeeding quarter. The PIU and sub-PIU will monitor the progress of\nimplementation in their respective areas of responsibility. Within three months after the physical\ncompletion of the Project, DVTE will submit a project completion report to ADB providing details\non implementation, accomplishments, benefits, and evaluation.\n88. Separate records and accounts for all expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of\nthe loan will be maintained by DVTE in accordance with sound accounting principles. They will\nspecify the expenditures for all activities and identify all expenditures to be financed out of the\nloan proceeds. Project accounts, including financial statements, statements of expenditures,\nand imprest account records, will be audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The\nauditors\u2019 report, and copies of the certified accounts and related financial statements, including\nthe auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of loan proceeds, compliance with loan covenants, and the use\nof the imprest account under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures, will be submitted to\nADB in English not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.", "29\n7.  Midterm Review\n89. In addition to semiannual reviews, a comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken\nby the Government and ADB at about the end of the second year of project implementation to\nassess the Project\u2019s progress and achievements against its objectives; to identify any difficulties\nbeing encountered; and to recommend remedial action, if and where required.\n8.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n90. DVTE  will  develop  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  subsystem  within  the  integrated\nmanagement  information  system  for  the  PVE  system  to  collect  and  analyze  data  for\nmanagement, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of the PVE system,\nas well as to measure PVEI-level sustainability. The subsystem will include information on the\nProject, including staff and student flows, internal and external efficiency indicators, the staff\ndevelopment program, the status of facilities and equipment, and education costs and finance.\nThe subsystem will also include those indicators specified in the project framework in Appendix\n1.  Additional  indicators  for  the  subsystem  will  be  developed  by  DVTE  and  the  finalized\nsubsystem  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  concurrence  within  three  months  after  loan\neffectiveness.\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n91. No adverse environmental effects are expected from the Project. Civil works will be\nmostly upgrading of existing PVEI facilities scattered throughout the country.\n2. Social Analysis\n92. During Project preparation, a social sector analyst was included in the TA consultant\nteam and a poverty specialist was engaged to participate in loan fact finding. The social sector\nanalyst identified disadvantaged and vulnerable groups in the different regions of the country\n(including gender analysis), and carried out a social impact analysis. Thereafter, measures were\nincorporated into the Project design to address the needs of these identified vulnerable groups\nand to mitigate potential negative social impacts. The poverty specialist, through field visits,\nvalidated the social analysis and made additional recommendations to strengthen the poverty\nreduction aspects of the Project. Measures incorporated into the Project design as a result of\nthis process include the use of mobile training units and outreach programs, the microcredit\nfund, use of NGOs to implement parts of the Project, disaggregation of labor market and benefit\nmonitoring and evaluation information requirements to enable gender and poverty analysis, and\nstrong support for IEC and advocacy campaigns. Also, the TA was carried out in a participatory\nmanner. At the start of the TA, a national visioning workshop was held with various stakeholder\ngroups to identify the characteristics required of a well-functioning skills and entrepreneurship\ndevelopment system in the Kyrgyz context. As a result of this process, Project objectives were\ngrouped into key result areas. Each key result area was validated through visits to all oblasts\nusing focus group discussions among stakeholder groups and rapid assessment surveys. In the\nprocess, awareness of the Project was raised among these groups.\nH. Technical Assistance\n93. While the Project addresses the comprehensive and more urgent development needs in\nskills  and  entrepreneurship  development,  the  enabling  environment  for  skills  and", "30\nentrepreneurship development in the country also need to be improved (para. 42). This will\nrequire not only improving the policy and legislative environment but also developing a medium-\nto long-term vision and strategic framework and action plans for skills and entrepreneurship\ndevelopment in the country in both international and Central Asian contexts. To carry this out,\nsupporting TA will be provided to help MLSP with this strategic process, and to improve the\nenabling environment. The TA will build upon the activities started during the project preparatory\nTA and assist MLSP officials in carrying out external and internal scanning of the country\u2019s\nstrengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats with respect to skills and entrepreneurship\ndevelopment. Existing legislation will be reviewed, constraints identified, and recommendations\nfor improvement submitted to the Government. Thereafter, IEC, advocacy campaigns, and\nsocial marketing of policies and plans will be conducted. The TA is estimated to cost about\n$742,000 equivalent, comprising $464,000 in foreign exchange cost and $278,000 equivalent in\nlocal currency cost. Of these costs, ADB will provide $600,000 on a grant basis from the Japan\nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, to finance the entire foreign exchange cost\nand part of the local currency cost. A description of the TA is given in Appendix 21.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic Analysis58\n94. To improve its economic performance and be competitive both globally and in Central\nAsia,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  needs  to  produce  a  competent  and  productive  workforce  (both\nemployed and self-employed) that can respond flexibly to market demand. This will require\nreorienting the country\u2019s skills and entrepreneurship development systems to provide quality\ntraining that is relevant and market-driven. The Project will reorient the formal PVE system and\nstrengthen the nonformal sector of skills and entrepreneurship development to address this\nneed.  The  establishment  of  a  labor  market  analysis  system  and  skills  certification  and\naccreditation systems will ensure the quality and relevance of PVE programs. With improved\nquality  and  relevance,  it  is  expected  that  quantitative  and  qualitative  improvements  in\nemployment  and  self-employment  are  expected  to  be  realized  among  both  the  general\npopulation  and  disadvantaged  groups.  In  addition  to  improving  the  skills  of  the  country\u2019s\nworkforce, the Project\u2019s improvements in entrepreneurship development will also contribute to\nemployment generation,59 particularly in the sectors of agriculture and financial and business\nservices.\n95. The Project\u2019s mapping exercise will lead to a rationalization of the PVE system that will\nimprove efficiency of the PVE delivery network and sustainability of PVEIs, as well as outreach\nto the poor and disadvantaged groups. The Project will introduce best practices in training\nmethods and curricula that are appropriately adapted to local conditions and needs.\n96. The two development facilities and the microcredit fund provided under the Project will\nallow more equitable distribution of benefits to institutions and individuals. The development\nfacility for training innovations will promote innovative curriculum and program development by\nboth private and public sector entities, and strengthen ownership for these programs as they are\nimplemented.  The  development  facility  for  production  activities  will  not  only  enhance  the\nsustainability of PVEIs but also induce PVEI directors to rationalize business plans for their\n                                                \n58 The analysis provided herein is qualitative both because of data constraints and because the Project\u2019s benefits\ncannot be adequately quantified for a rate of return analysis.\n59 With the present experience that about 40 percent of PVEI entrepreneurship graduates eventually start their own\nbusinesses (para. 29), even as microentrepreneurs with less than 7 paid employees, the employment generation\npotential would be significant.", "31\nrespective institutions as a requirement for availing of the fund. The microcredit fund will give\nenterprising PVEI graduates an opportunity to start their own small businesses. To avail of this\nfund, these graduates will have developed sound business plans in cooperation with their\nrespective PVEIs and thus improve the likelihood of success in starting up their businesses.\n97. The accompanying TA will establish the long-term policy and strategy framework for\nskills  and  entrepreneurship  development  in  the  country  and  recommend  legislation  for\nGovernment and/or Parliament approval that will improve the enabling environment for skills\nand entrepreneurship development. The Project will also improve private sector, NGO, and\ncommunity cooperation with PVEIs and local government units.\n98. Educational  and  institutional  improvements  to  be  carried  out  under  the  Project  will\nimprove 29 model resource centers and 70 regular PVEIs in addition to an undetermined\nnumber of NGOs and other NFE institutions that will be able to avail of curriculum and program\nimprovements. The direct beneficiaries of the Project will be the students, graduates, teachers,\nand administrators of the formal PVE system, and the new entrepreneurs trained using project\nfacilities. Assuming existing levels of enrollments and graduation60 and the same structural\nproportions of gender and disadvantaged students, an estimated 67,000 students and 32,000\ngraduates will benefit over the five-year lifetime of the Project, of whom about 34 percent would\nbe female and 38 percent would come from poor and disadvantaged families, such as orphans,\nsingle-parent families, handicapped children, and refugees. A total of 212 administrators and\npolicymakers, 112 PVEI directors and head teachers, and 2,041 teachers, instructors, and\nadministrative staff nationwide will benefit from the country\u2019s staff development programs.\n99. At project completion, incremental recurrent expenditures to sustain new interventions\nintroduced by the Project will amount to about 17 percent of the 1998 recurrent expenditures for\nPVEIs.61  Despite  present  public  budget  constraints,  these  incremental  expenditures  are\nexpected to be met as (i) the newly reoriented PVE system will offer higher quality and more\nrelevant training programs that will attract and retain more fee-paying students; and (ii) the PVEI\ndirectors have demonstrated sufficient resourcefulness and ability to mobilize resources from\nthe community and the surrounding business and industry, and to generate their own revenue\nthrough production activities. The Project is designed to strengthen both.\nB.  Social Dimensions\n100. Female enrollment in the PVEIs, which comprises about 34 percent of total enrollment\n(Appendix 2), gravitates to the agriculture and service sectors. Over 90 percent of females\nestimated  to  be  enrolled  in  courses  for  light  industry  (sewing,  textiles),  services  (catering,\ntourism, personal, and health care) and agriculture. Of the 29 model resource centers, eight are\nin the services sector, eight in agriculture, and three in light industry. These resource centers\nwill contribute directly to improving the employability of women in the long term. The ratio of\nunemployed females to unemployed males (as registered with DES) is about 3:2. The Project\u2019s\naim to reduce unemployment will be expected to benefit women in the same proportion.\n                                                \n60 This may be considered a conservative assumption because, as the quality and relevance of PVE improves under\nthe Project, enrollment figures will likely increase.\n61 1998 figures are the latest available figures, expenditures for 2000 are estimated to be at the same level.", "32\nC.  Impact on Poverty\n101. The PVEIs cater to a large segment of the disadvantaged group of students, namely,\nthose who are not able to secure a place in the general education stream and those who are\nfrom poor and/or refugee families, orphans or from single-parent families, or disabled. Budget\nstudents  (who  comprise  about  80  percent  of  total  PVE  enrollment)  are  fully  or  partially\nsubsidized by the Government budget according to means-tested criteria applied by the Social\nProtection  Department  of  MLSP.  The  Project  will  improve  the  employability  and  self-\nemployability of these students, and give them an opportunity to break away from the poverty\ncycle experienced by their families.\n102. The existing poverty surveys62 indicate that reliance on agricultural subsistence and\nwage earnings is directly correlated with a rural family\u2019s level of poverty. The eight model\ncenters to be developed in agriculture production and processing dispersed throughout the\ncountry are expected to improve the effectiveness of agriculture-related activities and income\nproduction capability particularly in the rural areas. The PVEIs also serve another particularly\ndisadvantaged group\u2014those living in company towns built around large state enterprises that\nhave closed down since independence. Most of these towns are served by PVEIs that will be\nimproved under the Project. In addition, the outreach programs to be developed under the\nProject will serve towns that do not have a PVEI in their area.\n103. The microcredit fund under the Project will also contribute to poverty reduction. The\nsymbiotic link between training and microcredit will be most effective among the poor and\ndisadvantaged groups of PVEI graduates whose only option is to start a small business. The\navailability of microcredit will provide them with an immediate opportunity to translate their newly\nacquired skills into a business.\nD. Risks\n104. Although  DVTE  has  experience  implementing  a  component  of  a  past  World  Bank\nproject, the magnitude and complexity of the Project will be a major challenge to DVTE\u2019s\nimplementation capacity. The implementation responsibility matrix in Appendix 19 shows that\nthe challenge of Project implementation will be shared by DVTE with various other central and\nlocal units. Staff turnover is also an inevitable concern, as experience with the ESDP and past\nTAs demonstrates. The same implementation responsibility matrix will serve as a guide to\ninstitutional responsibilities and enhance the continuity of project activities. Also, vigilant project\nadministration and monitoring by ADB staff will be a key factor for continuity. Another concern is\nthat  English  is  not  widely  understood  by  PIU  and  DVTE  staff.  The  Project  includes  staff\ndevelopment and consulting services to strengthen DVTE in this regard. Also, provision is being\nmade to translate key project documents into Russian (such as this report, the Loan and Project\nAgreements, and the Project administration memorandum).\n105. The  existing  legislative  and  taxation  environment  surrounding  skills  and\nentrepreneurship development will tend to hamper some of the Project\u2019s activities, particularly\nfor the start-up entrepreneurs who will be trained by the Project. The accompanying TA for\nimproving the enabling environment is designed to address this concern in addition to its\nproactive visioning and strategy formulation.\n                                                \n62 Kyrgyz poverty monitoring surveys and living standards measurement surveys.", "33\n106. The overall lack of budgetary funds for the PVE system will also pose a risk to the\nProject.  The  Project  is  designed  to  strengthen  PVEI-level  sustainability  by  improving\nparticipatory  development  partnerships  at  the  institution  and  community  level,  as  well  as\nstrengthening the income-generating capacity of PVEIs. The Project provides development\nfacilities to support start-up of these activities.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n107. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Within one year of the completion of the school mapping, the Government will\nsubmit to ADB its plan to rationalize the PVE sector and thereafter commence\nthe rationalization.\n(ii)  Within six months after the loan becomes effective, MLSP through the PIU will\nsubmit for ADB\u2019s concurrence, details of the staff development programs. The\nPIU  will  incorporate  bonding  agreements  with  the  out-of-country  training\nprograms to be carried out under the Project, with the aim of multiplying the\ntraining to other staff as appropriate.\n(iii)  The  first  10  microcredit  applications  slated  for  approval  by  SFSMB  will  be\nreviewed jointly with ADB before final approval.\n(iv)  Within  three  months  after  the  loan  becomes  effective,  DVTE  will  develop\nindicators  for  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  subsystem,  and  submit  the\nspecifications of the finalized subsystem for ADB\u2019s concurrence.\nB. Condition for Loan Effectiveness\n108. Before the loan becomes effective, MLSP will appoint the project director, the project\nmanager, and key staff of the PIU and sub-PIUs, subject to ADB\u2019s concurrence.\nC. Conditions for Disbursement\n109. Four  conditions  must  be  met  relating  to  establishment  of  three  separate  technical\ncommittees and finalization of a subsidiary loan agreement for the microcredit fund.\n(i)  Before  any  disbursement  is  made  for  the  development  facility  for  training\ninnovations, MLSP will finalize (a) the terms of reference and membership of the\ntechnical committee, (b) the criteria and procedures for screening and selecting\ninnovations in PVE training, and (c) procedures for availing of the development\nfacility,  and  submit  these  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence,  and  after  securing  ADB\nconcurrence, establish the committee.\n(ii)  Before any disbursement is made for the development facility for production\nactivities, MLSP will finalize (a) the terms of reference and membership of the\ntechnical committee, (b) the criteria and procedures for screening and selecting\nbusiness plans, and (c) procedures for availing of the facility, and submit the\nsame for ADB\u2019s concurrence, and after securing ADB concurrence, establish the\ncommittee.\n(iii)  Before any disbursement is made from the microcredit fund, MLSP will finalize\nthe terms of reference and membership of the technical committee that will\nreview and screen business plans and the criteria, and procedures for availing of", "34\nthe microcredit fund, and submit the same for ADB's concurrence, and after\nsecuring ADB concurrence, establish the committee.\n(iv)  Before  any  disbursement  is  made  from  the  microcredit  fund,  MLSP,  in\nconsultation with MOF and SFSMB, will finalize the criteria and procedures for\navailing  of  the  fund  in  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  (that  will  include  the\nestablishment  of  a  distinct  unit  within  SFSMB  to  implement  the  Project's\nmicrocredit  component  and  maintain  a  separate  accounting,  monitoring,  and\nreporting system for the microcredit component), and submit the same for ADB\u2019s\nconcurrence.\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n110.

Rationale. At present, most primary vocational education (PVE) curricula are in the\ntraditional Soviet form, highly specialized, and without much regard for labor market demand or\nflexibility  to  move  across  specializations.  While  the  Project  will  improve  the  quality  and\nrelevance of PVE curricula, there is an accompanying need to incorporate and/or disseminate\nthe successes of ongoing fragmented efforts to modernize and reorient curricula. Also, there is\na need to encourage and support appropriate training innovations. These innovations typically\noriginate at two levels: (i) individuals, usually primary vocational education institution (PVEI)\ndirectors  and  teachers,  who  have  adapted  traditional  courses  to  local  demand,  and\n(ii) institutions and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) that have focused on skills training\nand entrepreneurship development. Furthermore, it is expected that training requirements will\nchange as the country adapts to a market economy. To support existing work and requirements\nthat  may  emerge  during  project  implementation  and  were  not  anticipated  during  project\nprocessing, a development facility for training innovations will be incorporated into the Project.\n2. Objective.  This  facility  is  intended  to  support  (i)  development  of  existing  and  new\ntraining programs that may be given priority during project implementation, (ii) implementation of\nnew special training for specific beneficiary groups, (iii) innovations in training methodology, and\n(iv) development of new instructional materials or media.\n3. Nature of the Facility. Funding will be provided for training innovations according to a\nproposal-approval-award process. Proposals will be reviewed and approved by a technical\ncommittee1 appointed by the minister of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) and\nchaired by the director of MLSP\u2019s Department for Vocational Training and Education (DVTE).\nAwards will be in the form of block grants; the amount2 and phasing of disbursements will\ndepend on the proposal.\n4. Criteria for Evaluation and Award. Evaluation criteria for the proposals will include\ntechnical soundness of the proposed innovation, relevance to priority specializations, use of\nappropriate  technology,  development  and  implementation  costs,  beneficiary  coverage  and\nneeds,  potential  for  replication,  and  sustainability.  Special  consideration  will  be  given  to\nproponents who can provide counterpart support or mobilize community or local government\nsupport. DVTE in consultation with the technical committee will be responsible for developing\nand submitting the detailed criteria for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) concurrence, also as\na condition of disbursement.\n5. Eligible  Participants.  The  facility  may  be  availed  of  by  PVE  institutions,  other\neducational institutions, NGOs, private employers, individuals, or groups.\n6. Implementation Arrangements. The funds for the facility will be disbursed according to\nguidelines  and  procedures  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  funds  will  be\nadministered by the project implementation unit (PIU) under the guidance of DVTE. Block grants\nwill be disbursed in a phased manner according to monitorable milestones or indicators that\nmust be elaborated in the proposal. The PIU will conduct information campaigns in every oblast\nabout  the  availability  and  operating  policies  and  guidelines  of  the  fund.  Proposals  will  be\nreviewed and approved quarterly. The deadlines for submitting proposals for each quarter will\nbe set by the PIU in consultation with the technical committee.\n                                                \n1 This committee is envisaged to include representation from the Republican Scientific and Methodological Center,\nexperienced PVEI directors, and private employers. Subject-specific experts may be asked to advise the\ncommittee as needed. The exact membership and specific terms of reference of the committee will be finalized\nduring project implementation, subject to ADB\u2019s concurrence, as a condition of disbursement.\n2 The amount of each block grant may vary, and will be determined by the technical committee.", "49 Appendix 8\nDEVELOPMENT FACILITY FOR PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES\n1. Rationale.  As  public  budget  support  for  primary  vocational  education  (PVE)  has  been\ndiminishing, many primary vocational education institutions (PVEIs) have been successful in augmenting\ntheir budgets with income generated from production units and farms. At the same time, these production\nfacilities serve as venues for practical skills and entrepreneurship training for PVE students. The Project\nwill provide a development facility to support these production and entrepreneurship activities in PVEIs\nwhere they already exist, and assist other PVEIs in establishing similar production and entrepreneurship\nactivities to enhance their sustainability.\n2. Objective. The facility is intended to improve the sustainability of PVEIs by enhancing their\nincome-generating capabilities through support for production and entrepreneurship activities, as well as\nenhance the practical skills and entrepreneurship training of students.\n3. Nature of the Facility. Funding will be provided to PVEIs to develop new, or improve existing,\nproduction facilities on the basis of business plans submitted by the PVEI directors. The business plans\nwill be reviewed and approved by a technical committee1 appointed by the Ministry of Labor and Social\nProtection (MLSP), and chaired by the director of MLSP\u2019s Department for Vocational Training and\nEducation  (DVTE).  Awards  will  be  in  the  form  of  block  grants  and  the  amount2  and  phasing  of\ndisbursements will depend on the business plan.\n4. Criteria for Evaluation and Awards. Business plans will be evaluated on a competitive basis\naccording to the following general criteria: rationale and justification for applying for a block grant,\ntechnical soundness, contribution to the PVEI\u2019s practical training program, and commitment of the PVEI\nto sustain a revolving fund mechanism. DVTE in consultation with the technical committee will be\nresponsible  for  developing and  submitting  the  detailed  criteria  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nconcurrence, also as a condition of disbursement.\n5. Eligible Participants. The facility may be availed of by model resource centers and PVEIs.\n6. Implementation  Arrangements.  The  funds  will  be  disbursed  according  to  guidelines  and\nprocedures acceptable to the Government and ADB. The funds will be administered by the project\nimplementation unit (PIU) under the guidance of DVTE. Block grants will be disbursed in a phased\nmanner according to measurable milestones or indicators that should be elaborated in the business\nplans. The PIU will disseminate operational policies and guidelines, as determined by DVTE, to all PVEIs\nbefore implementation of the facility. PVEIs will finalize their business plans in consultation with DVTE\nand submit them to the PIU. The business plans should include the rationale or justification for applying\nfor a block grant, implementation plans, monitoring indicators, the planned linkage of the production\nfacilities with the PVEI\u2019s practical training programs, and a commitment by the PVEI to sustain the\nrevolving fund that will be supported by the block grant. Proposals will be approved in two batches. The\nfirst batch will be for those PVEIs identified as model resource centers, and will be approved in time for\nimplementation starting fiscal year 2002. The second batch will be for the rest of the PVEIs, and will be\napproved in time for implementation starting fiscal year 2003. Proposals will be reviewed by the technical\ncommittee in consultation with DVTE. After initial review, the technical committee may request further\nrefinements of the business plan relating to the proposal, and issue guidelines for negotiations between\nthe  PIU  and  the  PVEI  on  the  manner  of  implementation,  actual  amount  of  the  block  grant,  the\ndisbursement schedule, and the sustaining of the revolving fund. During implementation, the recipient\nPVEI will submit semiannual progress and financial reports for audit purposes.\n                                                \n1 It is envisaged that this committee will include experienced PVEI directors who have successful production activities in their\ninstitutions. Representatives from the local community and private business and industry may be asked to advise the\ncommittee as needed. The exact membership and specific terms of reference of the committee will be finalized during project\nimplementation subject to ADB concurrence, as a condition of disbursement.\n2 The size of each block grant may vary according to the business plan submitted and will be determined by the technical\ncommittee in consultation with DVTE. It is estimated that each PVE institution may receive a total block grant ranging from\n$5,000 to $15,000.", "50\nAppendix 9, page 1\nMICROCREDIT FUND\nA. Rationale\n1. An essential complementary strategy for entrepreneurship development is the provision\nof  accessible  and  appropriate  credit  to  potential  entrepreneurs  who  have  undergone  skills\ntraining and practiced or apprenticed in actual business activities. The Project needed such a\ncomplementary scheme for the graduates of the primary vocational education (PVE) system. To\nidentify a suitable microcredit mechanism for the Project, a review of nine existing microcredit\ndelivery  programs1  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  how  they  addressed  the  credit  needs  of\nmicroentrepreneurs was carried out. Roundtable discussions were held with primary vocational\neducation institution (PVEI) directors to determine the feasibility of linking training programs to a\nmicrocredit scheme for graduates.\n2. Most  existing  credit  schemes  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  are  supported  by  aggressive\ndevelopment activities usually funded by external sources; administrative and support cost are\noften several times larger than the actual amount lent to the borrowers. The development\nassistance is meant to create suitable and viable social and institutional infrastructure, as well\nas assist with legal and regulatory aspects, to enable the microcredit scheme to be sustainable.\nExperiences in the Kyrgyz Republic show a generally high repayment rate among borrowers,\nespecially if denominated in som, but greater difficulty in repayment among those who borrowed\nin equivalent foreign currency. The developing nature of the country\u2019s financial infrastructure\ncoupled with highly volatile inflation rates2 are the weak links, and contribute to high cost of\nadministering the credit scheme, resulting in high interest rates to the borrowers.\n3. Adequate and reliable information is not available for a rigorous demand and supply\nanalysis of credit for microentrepreneurs. However, information from focus discussion groups\ninvolving  entrepreneurs  conducted  during  project  preparation  indicates  that  the  absorptive\ncapacity for microcredit for such purposes is large, particularly in the informal labor market\nwhere small businesses operate. The two major issues mentioned by entrepreneurs interviewed\nwere  the  lack  of  financing  sources  and  the  prevailing  difficult  environment,  in  particular,\ncumbersome red tape and an onerous tax code. On the supply side, with the exception of the\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  scheme  for  Loan  1529(SF)-KGZ,  which  only  requires\nmembership in a credit union to qualify for a loan,3 other microcredit schemes reviewed have\nspecific target groups of beneficiaries, e. g., agricultural loans, loans for rural women, loans for\npoor  self-help  groups  as  identified  by  volunteers,  or  registered  unemployed.  Also,  some\nmicrocredit schemes are limited to geographic areas (e.g., targeting the poorer or southern\noblasts). To provide entrepreneur graduates equal opportunity for credit, a microcredit fund will\nbe piloted under the Project.\n                                                \n1 Schemes examined included those of the Asian Development Bank Loan No. 1529(SF)-KGZ: Rural Financial\nInstitutions, for $12.5 million, approved on 21 August 1997; two World Bank-funded projects with the Kyrgyz\nAgricultural  Finance  Corporation,  Mercy  Corps  International  supported  by  the  United  States  Department  of\nAgriculture;  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development-funded  Foundation  for  International\nCommunity Assistance, the State Fund for Support of Small and Medium Business (SFSMB); and the microcredit\ncenters of the Department of Employment Services of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection.\n2 Inflation rate estimates for the Kyrgyz Republic have been changing rapidly. The inflation rate for 1999 was\nestimated at about 41 percent per annum. At appraisal (June 2000), the inflation rate estimate was fluctuating\nbetween 27 to 30 percent per annum but has since dropped to about 15 percent per annum.\n3 Project-trained entrepreneurs would not be ready to join credit unions outright because of the membership\nrequirements but could be expected to join such unions after accumulating some savings.", "51\nAppendix 9, page 2\n4. The prerequisites for a desirable microcredit scheme for the Project are (i) it should be\naccessible to the target beneficiaries (i.e., the potential entrepreneurs among PVEI graduates);\n(ii) it should provide credit at real lending rates without subsidy; (iii) it should be efficiently\nadministered to be relatively affordable compared with other schemes; (iv) it should add value to\nor further the technology of microcredit management and institutional infrastructure; and (v) if\npossible, it should not develop a new scheme but instead avail of an existing microcredit\nmechanism.  In  addition  to  these  considerations,  the  following  criteria  were  applied:\n(i) sustainability of the financial intermediary, (ii) sustainability of the microcredit scheme, and\n(iii) flexibility of collateral requirements.\n5. Among various alternatives evaluated, the State Fund for Support of Small and Medium\nBusiness  (SFSMB)  was  found  to  be  the  most  appropriate  financial  intermediary  for\nimplementing  the  Project's  microcredit  fund  (Appendix  10  includes  institutional  details  on\nSFSMB). SFSMB has a functioning management structure for fund management, experience in\nconducting  commercial  and  financial  viability  appraisal,  and  trained  staff  to  monitor  loan\nrepayments and collection at the oblast level. Furthermore, SFSMB has an ongoing partnership\nwith  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)-assisted  Small  Business\nDevelopment Center (SBDC) using an integrated business center approach. Advisory units of\nSBDC in each oblast will be able to support and advise borrowers on their business planning\nand operations as well as assist SFSMB (on a fee basis) to assess loan applications and\nmonitor loan performance. SFSMB will accept both physical and social collateral under the\nscheme.\nB. The Microcredit Fund\n1. Underlying Principles\n6. The microcredit scheme will follow the underlying working principles:\n(i)  The scheme should work within the policy framework and development strategies\nof the Project and should be consistent with ADB's microfinance strategy.4\n(ii)  The multisectoral project steering committee will provide overall policy guidelines\nin  project  implementation,  while  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  provide  policy\ndirection  and  general  guidelines  on  funding  mechanisms  of  the  microcredit\nscheme and operations.\n(iii)  The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) through the Department for\nVocational Training and Education (DVTE) will be responsible for the overall\nsuccess of the Project, with SFSMB as the responsible financial intermediary for\nthe implementation of the microcredit component. Thus, overall coordination and\nmonitoring of all project activities, including microcredit, will be the responsibility\nof DVTE.\n(iv)  SFSMB will also be responsible for the appraisal and approval of endorsed credit\napplications, loan disbursements, and collection of repayments, and arranging for\nadvisory financial services to the subborrowers.\n2. Onlending Terms\n7. ADB  will  lend  to  the Government  $1 million  equivalent  in  foreign  exchange  for  the\nmicrocredit  component.   The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  onlend  the  funds  to\n                                                \n4 R106-00, Finance for the Poor - Microfinance Development Strategy, 16 May 2000.", "52\nAppendix 9, page 3\nSFSMB5 in som equivalent, with MOF assuming the foreign exchange risk. The interest rate to\nbe charged by MOF will be a fluctuating rate equal to the inflation rate prevailing at the time of\nonlending plus the risk insurance charges assumed by MOF. The term of onlending would be 20\nyears including a 7-year grace period. Penalty fees would be at 0.2 percent per annum. SFSMB\nwould pay back the principal plus interest semiannually.\n8. SFSMB will onlend in som to individual subborrowers and/or groups of subborrowers,\nunder the following conditions:\n(i)  The maximum amount of a single loan will be the som equivalent of $1,000.\n(ii)  The maximum lending term (repayment period) will be 2 years. In general, the\nrepayment period will depend on the type of business.\n(iii)  The lending rate will be MOF's interest rate (para. 7) plus a margin to cover\nSFSMB's administrative costs, service fees, and provision for bad debts.6\n(iv)  Each  loan  will  be  governed  by  a  written  contract  between  SFSMB  and  the\nsubborrower that will specify the repayment schedule, grace period (if any), and\npenalty fees for late repayments.\n3. Requirements for Subborrowers\n9. Before  a  subborrower  or  group  of  subborrowers  can  avail  of  a  loan,  the  following\nrequirements must be fulfilled:\n(i)  The subborrower will be either a graduate or a student in good standing in a\nPVEI.\n(ii)  The  subborrower  will  submit  an  acceptable  and  viable  business  plan  in  the\nproper format.\n(iii)  The subborrower will undergo the required borrower training to be provided by\nSFSMB or its training representatives.\n(iv)  The subborrower will pass SFSMB's credit investigation.\n(v) The subborrower should have appropriate collateral as determined by SFSMB\n(social collateral may be allowed depending on circumstances).\n4.  Step-by-step Procedures\n10. The following procedures will apply.\n(i)  Applicants  will  submit  business  plans  in  the  required  format  to  a  technical\ncommittee comprising officials of DVTE and selected PVEI directors who have\nsubstantial technical experience in appraising business plans. In this respect,\nadvice will be available from the UNDP-assisted SBDC and its branch offices.7\nSince the technical committee will be based in Bishkek, applications may be in\nfax or electronic form, to enable quick processing of oblast level applications.\n                                                \n5 Onlending will be done in a phased manner as agreed to by SFSMB, MLSP, and ADB.\n6 With the current estimate of the annual inflation rate at about 15 percent, plus MOF estimates of its risk insurance\ncharge at about 2-4 percent, plus SFSMB's present margin of 7 percent, the Project's Microcredit Fund would now\nhave a lending rate of about 25 percent. This is consistent with SFSMB's current charges of 25-45 percent interest\non its loans depending on the individual circumstances surrounding each loan.\n7 The SBDCs provide a range of services from advice on preparation of business plans, borrower training, organizing\nof workshops, and monitoring of loans. See also para. 3 of Appendix 10 for a description of cooperation between\nSFSMB and SBDC.", "53\nAppendix 9, page 4\n(ii)  The technical committee will screen the applications and submit a longlist of\nacceptable business plans to the corresponding regional office of SFSMB, where\nthe applicant resides. The regional office will decide, according to SFSMB's\nprocessing procedures, which applications in the longlist will be accepted.\n(iii)  The  accepted  applicant  completes  the  required  loan  documentation  with  the\nassistance of SFSMB's technical staff at the regional office.\n(iv)  After all requirements are fulfilled, the loan is released by the regional office of\nSFSMB in the form of bank transfer.\n(v)  Monitoring of loans and collection of repayments will be the responsibility of\nSFSMB.\n11. The flowchart of the proposed Microcredit Fund is shown below.\n5. Undertakings by DVTE and SFSMB\n12. The following will be undertaken by DVTE and SFSMB to ensure proper implementation\nof the loan:\n(i)  Before any part of the Project's microcredit component is disbursed, DVTE will\nestablish the technical committee described above (para. 10[i]) to review and\nscreen  business  plans.  The  terms  of  reference  and  membership  of  the\ncommittee, and the criteria for accepting business plans for onward endorsement\nto SFSMB will be subject to ADB concurrence.\n(ii)  Before any part of the Microcredit Fund is disbursed, SFSMB will establish a\ndistinct unit8 at the central level for microcredit of PVEI graduates and students.\nThe terms of reference of that unit will be subject to ADB concurrence.\n(iii)  The first 10 microcredit applications will be reviewed jointly with ADB before final\napproval.\n(iv)  SFSMB will maintain separate accounting for the microcredit component and\nsubmit a quarterly status report to DVTE and ADB (in English) on loans and\nrepayments.\n                                                \n8 This separate unit will serve a dual purpose: to maintain separate recording and monitoring for the Project\ncomponent and to pilot improvements on SFSMB's current (Soviet) style of record keeping and financial reporting.", "54\nAppendix 9, page 5\nFigure A9: Flowchart of the Microcredit Fund\nADB MOF NBKR\nPSC\nDVTE SFSMB\nPVEIs Business\nAdvisors\nSubborrowers/beneficiaries\nPotential entrepreneurs among PVEI\ngraduates\nLEGEND:\n               Funds flow ($)\n               Funds flow (Som)\n               Decision/Policy flow\nADB Asian Development Bank\nDVTE Department for Vocational Training and Education under the Ministry of Labor\nand Social Protection\nMOF Ministry of Finance\nNBKR National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic\nPSC project steering committee\nPVEI primary vocational education institution\nSFSMB State Fund for Support to Small and Medium Business", "55 Appendix 10, page 1\nSTATE FUND FOR SUPPORT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS\nA.  Legal Status and Mandate\n1. The State Fund for Support of Small and Medium Business (SFSMB) was established by\nPresidential decree on 23 August 1991 as the National Entrepreneurship Fund, later renamed the\nFund for Development of Entrepreneurship in the Kyrgyz Republic, and finally SFSMB. It is a nonprofit\nstate agency with a mandate to provide state support to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs)\nby means of financing, training, consultative and informational advice, and other services as needed\nby SMEs.\n2. The main objectives of SFSMB include (i) participate in the implementation of Government\nprograms and projects aimed at SME development, (ii) mobilize foreign and domestic resources for\nSME support, (iii) provide credit to SMEs using its own funds as well as provide assistance to SMEs\nto obtain credit from other sources, (iv) create support services for SMEs on a fee basis such as\ntraining and business advisory centers, and (v) assist in creating a legal environment favorable to\nSME development. Income from economic activities, interest on loans, as well as property received by\nSFSMB are not taxable, remain with SFSMB, and are directed to the realization of its objectives.\nSFSMB is accountable to the Government through the Office of the First Deputy Prime Minister\nresponsible for economics and industry.\nB.  Organization and Operation\n3. The organization chart of SFSMB is shown in Figure A10. SFSMB is based in Bishkek and has\nfive regional offices (in Jalal-Abad, Yssyk Kul, Naryn, Osh, and Talas oblasts), two representative\noffices (in Kemin and Toktogul raions), and a business incubator in Jayil raion. The total staffing\n(excluding the chairperson and deputy chairperson) is 24 technical staff and 11 support staff. Lending\noperations are fully delegated to regional offices for loans amounting to less than Som100,000.\nBeyond that amount, loan applications are endorsed to the head office in Bishkek, usually by fax, and\nacted upon by a credit commission that meets weekly. Channeling of funds to the regional offices is\ndone through commercial banks (if available) or branches of the Savings and Settlement Company,1\nwhich has an extensive network of rural branches and post offices to reach remote areas.\n4. In addition to the foregoing lending activities, SFSMB cooperates closely with the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) assisted Small Business Development Center (SBDC),\nwhich provides technical assistance (advisory and training services) through a network of integrated\nbusiness centers in Bishkek, and in Jalal-Abad, Yssyk Kul, Naryn, Osh, and Talas oblasts. This\ncooperation with integrated business centers was established by Government resolution2 in 1998.\nUnder the resolution, an integrated business center is tasked to provide the full range of services to\nsupport SMEs, and SFSMB has a tripartite arrangement with SBDC and local chapters of the Kyrgyz\nTrade and Industry Chamber. The regional offices of SFSMB provide financial support to SMEs\nthrough loans in priority areas such as agriprocessing; production of food, industrial, and general\nconsumption  goods;  manufacturing  of  export-oriented  goods,  processing  of  local  raw  materials;\nemployment generation; and implementation of new technologies. SBDC provides the consultative-\ntraining component and the local chapters of the Kyrgyz Trade and Industry Chamber provide the\ninformation component. This integrated approach will be used to support the subborrowers of the\nProject\u2019s microcredit component.\nC. Financial and Microcredit Experience\n5. Rigorous analysis of SFSMB's financial statements is constrained by the fact that they have\nnot been prepared according to internationally accepted accounting standards. Being a state agency\n                                                \n1  The Savings and Settlement Company is a national savings institution established in 1996 by the National Bank of the\nKyrgyz Republic primarily to provide savings and money shop services to rural areas.\n2  Resolution No. 206, approved on 21 April 1998.", "56 Appendix 10, page 2\nand  subject  to  Parliament  audit,  SFSMB  has  been  following  the  standard  prescribed  format  of\naccounting carried over from Soviet times.3\n6. SFSMB has two major sources of income, namely, 3 percent of the net proceeds of the\nGovernment\u2019s privatization program and income from SFSMB\u2019s lending operations.4 SFSMB does not\nreceive any allocation from either republican or local budgets. About a quarter of SFSMB\u2019s income is\nused for salaries and bonuses, and administrative and operational expenditures; the balance is\nchanneled back to lending. Table A10.1 summarizes SFSMB\u2019s income and expenditures for 1998,\n1999, and the first seven months of 2000.\nTable A10.1: SFSMB's Income and Expenditures, 1998-2000\n(Som \u2018000)\n1998 1999 2000\n Item (Jan-Dec) (Jan-Dec) (Jan-Jul)\nA.

Apart from the direct financial transfer of 3 percent of all privatization proceeds, information on\nother subsidies extended to SFSMB are not completely reflected in SFSMB's financial statements,\ne.g., tax exemptions and partial coverage by the state of rental of premises and depreciation of\nassets. Thus, calculation of a subsidy dependency index5 is not possible. SFSMB's reliance on\nexternal funding (the privatization proceeds are the major source), seen as a percentage of total\ninflows, declined from 95 percent when it started in 1992 to 51 percent in 1994, increased to 84\npercent in 1996, and thereafter, steadily declined to 27 percent in 1999, reflecting the irregular pattern\nof privatization proceeds.6 Regardless of this fluctuation, SFSMB's income from lending operations\ncan sustain its operational and administrative expenditures even if privatization proceeds slow down\nor stop completely.\n8. SFSMB started lending operations in 1992. During its first full year of lending operations\n(1993), SFSMB lent a total of Som2.5 million. Its lending level has since been increasing steadily and,\nin 1999, total loans amounted to Som13.8 million (an average annual increase of about 33 percent).\nTable A10.2 shows SFSMB\u2019s lending experience since 1998.\n                                                \n3  However, subloans under the Project's microcredit component will be recorded and accounted for separately using\ninternationally accepted accounting standards. In this respect, the Project's piloting of a microcredit component serves\nalso as a pilot for SFSMB to move to internationally accepted accounting standards.\n4  Income from lending operations include repayment of interest on loans, fees for collateral inspection, penalties on late\nrepayments, and a maximum of 7 percent margin for other administrative costs.\n5 Such as that discussed in Yaron, J. 1995. Assessing Development Finance Institutions - A Public Interest Analysis.\nWorld Bank Discussion Paper, World Bank, Washington, DC.\n6 In the first seven months of 2000, SFSMB has enjoyed a surge in privatization proceeds owing to a large inflow of\nSom7.5 million in June 2000.", "57 Appendix 10, page 3\nTable A10.2: Loans Provided by SFSMB\n                1998                                 1999                       2000 (Jan-Jul)      \nNumber Amount Number Amount Number Amount\n(Som \u2018000) (Som \u2018000) (Som \u2018000)\nBishkek 14 4,248.2 35 4,627.0 32 3,295.0\nChui 14 1,635.0 42 2,898.0 21 1,515.0\nJalal-Abad 15 1,744.0 28 1,343.4 7 1,053.0\nYssyk Kul 10 1,256.3 9 810.0 3 250.0\nOsh 1 500.0 20 1,777.0 9 519.0\nNaryn 15 1,115.0 21 1,396.5 18 993.0\nTalas 10 745.7 27 922.0 10 685.0\nTotal 79 11,244.2 182 13,773.9 100 8,310.0\nAverage Loan\nSize 142.3 75.7 83.1\n9. SFSMB provides loans7 to individuals and businesses up to a maximum of Som500,000,\nalthough the average loan amount hovers around Som80,000. The interest rate has fluctuated from\n25 to 45 percent depending on the type of business and on whether the loan is short (less than one\nyear) or long term (up to five years). If an entrepreneur has had good repayment experience with\nSFSMB, future loans may be given more favorable lending terms. Repayment of principal and interest\nare usually due quarterly. Collateral8 is required for all types of loans at present; however, for the\nProject\u2019s microcredit component, SFSMB officials have agreed to consider social collateral (e.g.,\nguarantees by peer groups or respected individuals).\n10. SFSMB's repayment rate9 experience is as follows: 1998, 76.1 percent; 1999, 71.2 percent;\nand 2000 (January to June), 86.7 percent. These repayment rates are lower than desirable compared\nwith  other  microcredit  experience  in  other  countries.  However,  this  is  in  large  part  due  to  the\ncomparative newness of savings and credit concepts to the general population and the relatively\nunstable banking situation. The improvement in repayment performance during 2000 can be attributed\nto a combination of tightening up of collateral requirements and improved borrower training and\nbusiness advice given by the recently established integrated business centers, which are specific\nstrategies undertaken by SFSMB to improve their lending operations.\n11. With its present level of staffing, SFSMB has an average loan processing time of about three\nweeks (assuming the application papers are completely and correctly filled out). Typically, the first\nweek is spent on advising and assisting the borrower to prepare a business plan, and orienting the\nborrower to SFSMB\u2019s guidelines and procedures. The second week is spent on helping the borrower\nto complete the loan documentation and submit it to the credit commission.\n12. In 1999, SFSMB provided loans for 182 projects and, in the first seven months of 2000, 100\nprojects. SFSMB estimates that an average of 50-60 more applications per year are declined mainly\nbecause of lack of collateral, nonfeasibility of the project, and lack of facilities and entrepreneurship\nskills among the applicants. At present, SFSMB has 413 applications pending (including those in the\nregional  offices)  for  a  total  of  Som120  million.  Given  SFSMB\u2019s  experience  and  the  recently\nestablished integrated business centers (that would reduce SFSMB\u2019s advisory-training function in\nfavor of lending), SFSMB is institutionally capable of processing more loans. The limiting factor\nappears to be lack of funds.\n                                                \n7  Loans fall into three categories: financial (for working capital), technical (for facilities and equipment purchase), and\nleasing.\n8  Present  collateral  requirements  are  as  follows:  financial  loan,  125-150  percent  of  loan  amount;  technical  loan,\n80 percent of loan amount (acquired equipment may be used as collateral); leasing loan, 25-30 percent of the amount of\nthe leasing transaction.\n9  Repayment rate is calculated as a percentage of the total som amount actually repaid for those loans and interest that\nfell due during the given period.", "Figure A10: Organization of SFSMB\nChairperson\nAdvisor1\nDeputy Chairperson\nRegional and Representative Offices, \nBusiness Incubator (Total of 22 Staff--\nAccountingUnit(2)\nTypical Staffing: director and chief \nAuditUnit(3)\naccountant plus one additional expert in \nFinance and Economics Unit (2)\neach regional office)\nLegalUnit(3)\nAdministrative   \n5\nManagement Department   8\n(Head plus 2 technical staff \nplus 5 support staff)\n \nCredit Management Department A\np\n(Head) p\ne\nn\nd\nix\n \n1\n0\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n4\nUnit for Long-\nUnit for Short-Term Loans and \nRepayment Unit (3)\nTerm Credit (2)\nMicrocredit (2)\n___________________________________\n1 The present adviser is concurrently the chief technical adviser of the United Nations Development Programme-assisted Small Business Development Center.", "59\nAppendix 11\nORGANIZATIONAL CHART OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION\nSteering Committee 1\n       Project Director\n     Project Manager\n       (Bishkek PIU)\n          Project\n     Consultants\n          Project\n      Coordinator\n    (Osh  Sub-PIU)\nConsultant Services/ Consultant Services/\nStaff Development Staff Development\n           Officer            Officer\n        Civil Works/       Civil Works/\n       Procurement       Procurement\n           Officer           Officer\n         Finance/          Finance/\n    Administrative     Administrative\n          Officer           Officer\n_________________\n1\nComprising the minister of labor and social protection (chairperson), the project director (secretary) and\nappropriate  representation  from  various  stakeholder  groups  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Education,\nScience, and Culture; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Industry and Foreign Trade; State Committee for\nForeign Investments and Economic Development (Goscominvest); State Fund for Support of Small and\nMedium Business; other government agencies as needed; private sector (e.g., Chamber of Commerce\nof the Kyrgyz Republic); and nongovernment organizations.", "SUMMARY OF STAFF DEVELOPMENT\nComponent/Subcomponent Number and Source of Participants\nDescription          Total                   PVEI          VTE Other Private or\nCategory Duration Participants Person- No. Model/ (incl.

The Project will include 705 person-months of consulting services to be provided by\n22 international consultants (230 person-months) and 29 domestic consultants (475 person-\nmonths). The type and duration of consulting services are listed in Table A13.\nA.  Reorientation of Primary Vocational Education Institutions\nSchool Mapping and Rationalization Specialists\n(international consultant, 1; domestic consultant, 1)\n2. The  specialists  will  update  the  existing  school  databases,  gather  relevant  socio-\ndemographic  data,  and  integrate  this  with  an  appropriate  geographic  information  system\nsoftware to analyze demand by targeted disadvantaged groups for specific skills training. The\nresults will lead to a school rationalization framework while upholding the roles of the primary\nvocational education institutions (PVEIs) in social protection.

Rationale\n1. As the Kyrgyz Republic moves to a market economy, it must put in place appropriate\nmechanisms  to  facilitate  the  transition  while  minimizing  adverse  effects  for  the  vulnerable\nsectors of society. Skills training and entrepreneurship development form one of the pillars of\nthe  Government\u2019s  transition  strategy.  Clear  policies  and  medium-  to  long-term  strategic\nframework for the development of the country\u2019s labor force, both for employment and self-\nemployment are needed. The enabling environment needs to be improved by establishing\ninstitutional infrastructure such appropriate legislation and taxation and supporting/providing\nsustained  advocacy  and  information,  education,  and  communication  (IEC)  campaigns  for\nstakeholders and the community at large.\nB. Objectives\n2. The technical assistance (TA) will assist the Government, particularly the Ministry of\nLabor  and  Social  Protection  (MLSP)  to  develop  a  medium-  to  long-term  strategic  policy\nframework and action plans for skills and entrepreneurship development. The TA will help\nMLSP  identify,  formulate,  and  advocate  appropriate  policy  and  legislative  reforms  that  will\nenable the PVE system to be more responsive to changing labor market requirements.\nC. Scope\n3. The TA will facilitate the development of an explicit vision and mission statement for\nskills and entrepreneurship development, taking into account international and Central Asian\nperspectives,  the  country\u2019s  comparative  advantage,  and  available  human  and  economic\nresources.  This  will  involve  internal  and  external  scanning  of  the  country\u2019s  (and  MLSP\u2019s)\nstrengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to evolve a strategic framework and action\nplans, including identification of policy and legislative agenda to implement them.\n4. The resulting strategic framework and action plans will be discussed and refined in a\nnational consultative workshop that will be facilitated by a panel of international authorities and\nexperts. The recommendations of that workshop will be followed up to the development of draft\nlegislation and policy pronouncements for the consideration of the Government. The TA will\ndevelop IEC strategies for social marketing of approved action plans.\nD. Consultant Requirements\n5. The TA will require three international consultants: a strategic planner for economic\ndevelopment  (3  person-months),  human  development  specialist  (3  person-months),  and\nlegislation specialist (3 person-months). These international consultants will work in cooperation\nwith four local consultants: a strategic planner for economic development (6 person-months),\nhuman development specialist (6 person-months), legislation specialist (3 person-months), and\nIEC and media specialist (3 person-months). The TA will engage three renowned authorities in\nstrategic planning, human development, and skills and entrepreneurship development to serve\nas a panel of experts in a national consultative workshop.", "76\nAppendix 21, page 2\nE. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n6. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $742,000 equivalent, comprising $464,000 in\nforeign  exchange  costs  and  $278,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  financing  from  Japan  Special  Fund  for  $600,000\nequivalent to cover all of the foreign costs and $136,000 equivalent of the local currency costs.\nThe Government will provide the balance of $142,000 equivalent, mostly in kind, which will\ncover the cost of counterpart staff and workshop participants (remuneration, per diem, and local\ntravel expenses), support staff; office facilities; utilities; supplies; and preparation, translation,\nand reproduction of documents. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are provided in\nTable A21.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n7. The Executing Agency for the TA will be MLSP though DVTE. The director of DVTE will\nadminister the TA and oversee the work of the consulting team. The team will work under the\nguidance of the project steering committee that has been established for the Project.\n8. An international consulting firm will be engaged for the TA according to ADB Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants. The team will gather preliminary information through minisurveys\nand discussions with stakeholders. Thereafter, a visioning workshop will be convened, bringing\ntogether senior-level government officials who have a policy role in skills and entrepreneurship\ndevelopment. After two follow-up workshops to cover other parts of the country (one in Bishkek\ncovering  the  northern  oblasts  and  one  in  Osh  covering  the  southern  oblasts),  a  national\nconsultative workshop, in which the panel of international authorities will participate, will be\nconvened to present and discuss the results of the previous workshops. Thereafter, the team\nwill develop legislative recommendations at a legislative workshop.\n9. The TA should be implemented within six months. The first workshop will be convened\nwithin two weeks after the start of the TA. The national consultative workshop will be held about\nthe  fourth  month  of  the  TA.  ADB  missions  will  be  scheduled  to  allow  ADB  input  at  both\nworkshops.", "77\nAppendix 21, page 3\nTable A21: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($ '000)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.
