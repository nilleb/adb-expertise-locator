I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan of up to $100 million to Lukoil Overseas Uzbekistan (LOU) and (ii) a partial risk guarantee \n(PRG) of up to $200 million of principal, plus interest and PRG fees, for commercial lenders for \nthe Kandym Gas Field Development Project in Uzbekistan. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Natural gas is one of the most important export commodities for Uzbekistan and a key \ndriver of the economy. In 2010, natural gas exports totaled about $3.5 billion, accounting for \n29% of total exports of goods and services and 10% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.1 \nThe Government of Uzbekistan has sought to develop new gas resources to replace its existing \nfields,  where  production  is  declining,  and  to  meet  expected  increased  demand  from  the \ndomestic market and the expanding export market. The government plans to develop new \nproduction and modernization projects valued at a total of $19.4 billion for oil and gas from 2011 \nto 2015, of which 85% is expected to be funded by foreign direct investment and external \nloans.2  \n \n3.  The Uzbekistan gas subsector is state-controlled and managed through Uzbekneftegaz, \na national holding company.3 Uzbekneftegaz\u2019s financial resources are not considered adequate \nto meet the significant investment required to fund the growth of the Uzbekistan gas subsector \nand its capacity to develop more technically challenging gas fields may be limited. In recognition \nof these constraints, the government has encouraged major foreign oil and gas operators to \npartner with Uzbekneftegaz and bring in much-needed external capital and expertise to meet \nthe development targets of the gas subsector. \n \n4.  Kandym and Khauzak\u2013Shady fields are two large gas fields in the Bukhara\u2013Khiva region \nin the southwestern part of central Uzbekistan. Lukoil Group (Lukoil), a major international oil \nand gas operator, is developing the two fields under a production sharing agreement (PSA). \nNatural gas in these fields has a high sulfur content, which requires a sophisticated drilling and \ndesulfurization process. Lukoil will be bringing in state-of-the-art technology to these fields to \nrealize environment-friendly and economically efficient gas production. \n \n5.  Lukoil first discussed the project with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in May 2007. \nLukoil  invited  ADB  to  lead  the  transaction  and  mobilize  the  cofinancing  and  political  risk \ninsurance, as no commercial bank has ever lent money to any major gas project in Uzbekistan. \nThe proposed project is thus seen as trailblazing, with much wider ramifications for energy and \ninfrastructure development and financing in Uzbekistan. To facilitate the participation of ADB \nand commercial banks , the government committed to allowing the sponsor to publicly disclose \npayments made by it under the PSA to the government for the life of the ADB loan (ongoing \n                                                \n1  Economic Intelligence Unit. 2011.

This disclosure will be \nmade on an annual basis in English and Uzbek.  \n \n2.  Project Design \n6.  The development and production of Kandym and Khauzak\u2013Shady gas fields is governed \nby  a  PSA  signed  in  June  2004  between  the  government  and  a  consortium  of  investors \ncomprising LOU and Uzbekneftegaz. The PSA defines the rights and obligations of the various \nparties. LOU is solely responsible for the funding, development, and operation of the two gas \nfields. The cash flows of the Kandym and Khauzak\u2013Shady gas fields will be segregated.  \n \n7.  The proceeds of the ADB loan and the PRG-covered commercial loan will only be used \nto finance the Kandym gas field, which is in its development stage. The ADB loan and PRG-\ncovered commercial loan will be repaid only from the cash flows of Khauzak\u2013Shady gas field \nwhich is a producing field (gas production started in 2007). The cash flows of Khauzak- Shady \nare considered adequate to service the ADB loan and PRG.  \n \n8.  The  Kandym  field  development  program  will  comprise  construction  of  \n production wells, gas collection clusters, a gas-processing plant, ancillary infrastructure, and \nother associated facilities. Khauzak\u2013Shady gas production started in November 2007. LOU \nplans to expand production capacity of Khauzak\u2013Shady field. \n \n9.  The  raw  gas  extracted  from  the  fields  is  transported  through  a  pipeline  to  a  gas \nprocessing plant (GPP) where the gas is treated to remove sulfur and condensates. The gas \nfrom Kandym will be processed at a Lukoil-owned GPP that is currently under construction, \nwhile Khauzak\u2013Shady gas is processed by a government-owned GPP located in Mubarek. The \nprocessed gas is then transported through government-owned trunk pipelines to the Uzbek \nborder with Kazakhstan where the gas is sold to an offtaker (currently Gazprom Export of the \nRussian Federation).  \n \n3.  The Borrower \n10.  Borrower. The borrower is LOU, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands and \nan  indirectly,  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Lukoil.  LOU  has  formed  two  wholly  owned \nsubsidiaries\u2014Lukoil Uzbekistan Operating Company (LUOC) to operate the assets of the PSA, \nand Lukoil Overseas Supply and Trading to market the gas under the PSA.  \n \n11.  Lukoil. Lukoil is one of the world\u2019s leading vertically integrated oil and gas companies \nactive in exploration and production of oil and gas, production of petroleum products and \npetrochemicals,  and  marketing  of  these  products.  Most  of  the  group's  exploration  and \nproduction has been based in the Russian Federation, but it has expanded to international \nmarkets in Africa, Central Asia, and Iraq. Lukoil owns modern refineries, and gas processing \nand petrochemical plants located in the Russian Federation and eastern and western Europe; \nits products are marketed in the Russian Federation, eastern and western Europe, and the \nUnited States. The parent company of Lukoil (OAO Lukoil) is a publicly listed company on the \nLondon Stock Exchange and has long-term investment grade ratings from Moody\u2019s (Baa2: \nstable) and Standard & Poor\u2019s (BBB\u2013: stable) as of the end of June 2011.  \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n ", "3 \n1.  Impact \n \n12.  The successful development of Kandym field, a major gas field, will lead to the following \nbeyond-project development impacts. First, the overall Uzbekistan gas subsector will expand by \nencouraging foreign operators to develop similar gas reserves and will bring in much-needed \ntechnical knowledge, development experience, and foreign capital. Second, the increase in gas \nproduction will lead to an increase in natural gas exports (one of the most important sources of \nexport revenue for the country) and opens the possibility of development of the downstream \npetrochemical subsector in Uzbekistan, which uses natural gas as its feedstock. An increase of \ngas resources will also make it viable for Uzbekistan to diversify its export market eastward to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)\u2014a pipeline is already in place. Third, the successful \nexperience of foreign commercial banks financing a large project in Uzbekistan (a first in the \nUzbekistan market) is expected to bring in new money from international commercial banks and \nforeign investors. \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n13.  The  outcome  will  be  the  successful  production  of  natural gas  in  Kandym  with first \nproduction estimated in 2015, with a peak of 8.1 bcm achieved by 2018. The gas produced will \nlead  to  increased  export  revenues  for  Uzbekistan  and  improved  governance  through  the \ndisclosure of payments from the project to the government. \n \n3.  Outputs \n \n14.  The outputs will be (i) the development of an environmentally safe,4 technically sound, \nand financially sustainable Kandym field;  (ii) successful mobilization of large-scale cofinancing \nfrom foreign commercial banks and (iii) increased local employment generation in a relatively \npoor rural area in the Bukhara\u2013Khiva region. The project will meet 80% of its employment needs \nlocally with an expected local employment generation of over 7,000 people. The project area is \na region with high unemployment, increasing migration movements, and low education and \nmedical service. One way of improving the socioeconomic environment of the Bukhara region is \nto  attract  external  investment to  provide  employment  opportunities to the  local  population. \nEmployment generated by the project will create a large number of opportunities for the citizens \nof Bukhara region and other neighboring provinces. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020  \n \n15.  Strategy  2020  identifies  the  energy  sector  as  a  core  operations  sector.5Catalyzing \n \ninvestments by increasing private sector participation in ADB's developing member countries is \none  of  the  five  strategic  drivers  of  change.  The  project  contributes  to  environmentally \nsustainable growth by enhancing efficient natural resource management in Uzbekistan through \ncapacity  development,  technology  deployment,  and  introduction  of  international  safeguard \nstandards  and  best  operating  practices. The project  has  the  potential  to  contribute  to the \npromotion of regional integration between the PRC, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan via potential \n                                                \n4  The project will employ sophisticated desulfurization technology, which will lead to production of natural gas from \nthe high-sulfur gas fields in an environmentally safe manner. \n5  ADB. 2008.

Consistency with the Country Strategy  \n \n16.  The project is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy and country operations \nbusiness  plan  for  Uzbekistan,6 which  recognize  the  critical  importance  of  private  sector \n \ndevelopment and the need for ADB private sector operations to promote export potential and to \ncatalyze foreign investment in infrastructure (including energy). By supporting the project, which \nis sponsored by a private foreign company (Lukoil), ADB will catalyze foreign direct investment \ninto the country in a sector with significant export potential.  \n \n3.  Consistency with the Energy Policy \n \n17.  The project is consistent with the ADB Energy Policy, which provides for assistance to \ngas field development, and transportation and distribution of gas; encourages private sector \ninvestment; and promotes effective regional cooperation to strengthen energy security.7  \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan  \n18.  The development of the gas fields requires continuous capital expenditure, as new wells \nmust be drilled to maintain production to compensate for depleted wells. Kandym field will have \na field life extending for the next two decades.  \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n19.  Khauzak\u2013Shady is a producing field. The bulk of the capital expenditure required for \nKhauzak\u2013Shady to meet the necessary production volumes are to be made during 2011\u20132013. \nThe project cost estimates are presented in Table 1. The details of the capital expenditure are in \nthe details of implementation arrangements.  \nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates for 2011\u20132013  \n($ million) \nItem  Kandym  Khauzak\u2013Shady \nCapital expenditure      \n  Drilling   100        132 \n  Construction  343       185 \n  Others    4         8 \nTotal  447  325 \n Source: Lukoil Overseas Uzbekistan. \n \n20.  The borrower is raising external financing of $500 million for development of the two \nfields. ADB will provide $100 million and the commercial lenders will provide $200 million in loan \nfor Kandym field. The commercial loan for Kandym will be covered by ADB\u2019s PRG. The rest of \nthe capital expenditure for Kandym over the life of the ADB loan is to be covered by project cash \nflows and Lukoil contributions. The Islamic Development Bank will provide $100 million and the \ncommercial lenders will provide $100 million loan for the Khauzak\u2013Shady field. The $100 million \nIslamic Development Bank loan and the $100 million commercial loan are expected to be \nutilized  for  Khauzak\u2013Shady  field  but  would  have  the  flexibility,  if  required,  to  be  used  for \nKandym field. This commercial loan of $100 million will have PRG cover from the Multilateral \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2006.

The external financing being raised represents only a portion of the total funds required \nto fully exploit all the recoverable reserves of the fields covered under the PSA. To meet the \nlarge scale of investment required, in addition to providing its own funds, the borrower may raise \na new round of external financing in the future. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory  The PSA is the main governing document that defines the rights and obligations of the \nframework  contractual parties in relation to the exploration, development, and production of the \ngas assets. The PSA, among other things, gives the borrower the right to access \ntransportation infrastructure and gas processing capacity, sell gas into the export \nmarket, and convert currency.  \n  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \nImplementation  The disbursement period for all loans is expected to be 18 months, currently estimated \nperiod  from fourth quarter 2011 to first quarter 2013. \nOperations  LUOC is responsible for project operations (based on the joint operating agreement \narrangements  between LOU and Uzbekneftegaz). \nOperation and  LUOC  will  be responsible for operation and maintenance  in  accordance  with the \nmaintenance  annual work programs and budgets approved by the steering committee.  \nPerformance  Key performance indicators will be reported by LOU and monitored by ADB and other \nmonitoring  lenders. In addition, an independent expert will monitor environmental compliance of \nKandym gas field. LOU will publicly disclose payments made by it under the PSA to the \ngovernment for the life of the ADB loan. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, LOU = Lukoil Overseas Uzbekistan, LUOC = Lukoil Uzbekistan Operating Company, \nPSA = production sharing agreement \nSource: Lukoil Overseas Uzbekistan. \n \n ", "6 \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n23.  The Kandym gas field project is financially viable and  is economically sustainable as the \neconomic internal rate of return is  higher than the social discount rate. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n24.  The proposed ADB loan of up to $100 million to LOU to finance the development of \nKandym gas field will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government \nguarantee. The ADB loan will have a maximum term of up to 8 years, including a grace period \nof 18 months and will be repaid quarterly. The ADB loan will carry an interest rate as well as \nother fees to be approved by ADB\u2019s investment committee.  \n \n25.  The proposed PRG of up to $200 million principal, plus interest and PRG fees, to \ncommercial  lenders  will  cover  a  loan  from  commercial  lenders  to  the  borrower  to  finance \ndevelopment of Kandym gas field. The PRG will have a tenor of up to 7 years and match the \ntenor of the loan from commercial lenders. Under the PRG, ADB will assume the risks of \ncurrency inconvertibility, nontransferability of funds, war, terrorism and political violence, and \nbreach of contract (arbitration award default and denial of recourse) on the guaranteed portion \nof  the  commercial  lenders\u2019  loan.  The  guaranteed  lenders  are  expected  to  comprise  BNP \nParibas,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Corporate  and  Investment  Bank,  Korea  Development  Bank,  and \nUniCredit Bank. They are eligible under applicable ADB policies as they relate to beneficiaries \nof credit enhancement products. The PRG will carry a guarantee fee as well as other fees and \nterms to be approved by ADB\u2019s investment committee. ADB\u2019s maximum aggregate liability \nunder the PRG will be up to $225 million.8 A portion of the PRG may be syndicated through \nreinsurance contracts to counterparties that are eligible under existing ADB policies. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n26.  ADB assistance adds value in the following ways:  \n(i)  The ADB loan will play a leading catalytic role as it facilitates, for the first time in \nUzbekistan,  the  raising  of  large-scale,  long-term,  commercial  financing  from \ninternational  commercial  banks.  The  successful  financing  of  the  project  will \nprompt  future  raising  of  much-needed  commercial  capital  for  the  general \ndevelopment of the gas subsector and other infrastructure projects in Uzbekistan.  \n(ii)  The ADB PRG is essential for the raising of cofinancing as it (along with the \nMIGA guarantee) covers the political risks that commercial lenders are currently \nnot willing to directly absorb. The PRG extended by ADB allows the project to \nraise cost-effective commercial cofinancing.  \n(iii)  ADB\u2019s presence in the transaction reduces the overall political risk of the project, \nwhich provides reassurance to the foreign sponsor.  \n(iv)  The  participation  of  ADB  has  been  instrumental  in  the  public  disclosure  of \npayments received by the government under the PSA for the life of the ADB loan. \n                                                \n8  The maximum aggregate liability is the maximum amount of principal plus interest and PRG fees that ADB can be \nheld liable for under the PRG should a guaranteed event occur and ADB exercises its right to pay the lenders the \nguaranteed portion of principal and interest on scheduled payment dates. ", "7 \nThis  is  considered  to  be  an  important  step  forward  by  the  government  in \npromoting transparency for the project; overall it sends a very positive signal to \nthe market.  \n(v)  The introduction of ADB\u2019s environment and social safeguards will improve overall \nsoundness of the project.  \n(vi)  The project will be the first private sector infrastructure project financed by ADB \nin Uzbekistan and broadens ADB\u2019s relationship with the country. The project also \nstrengthens  ADB\u2019s  relationship  with  key  development  partners\u2014the  Islamic \nDevelopment Bank and MIGA. \n \nC.  Risks  \n27.  The transaction follows a reserve-based lending structure for upstream gas financing, \nwhich is common in the project financing markets.  \n \n28.  Offtake risk. The gas produced from Khauzak\u2013Shady field is currently sold to Gazprom \nExport  (wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  Russian  gas  company,  JSC  Gazprom)  through \nUztransgaz at the gas sale delivery point at the Kazakhstan\u2013Uzbekistan border. The project is \nexposed to market risk since gas volume and price are not underpinned by a long-term offtake \ncontract. The term of the gas sale contract has historically been limited to 1 year but so far, \nrenewed every year. The gas sale price is the standard market price received for all gas sales \nfrom Uzbekistan to the Russian Federation. The gas sale price is in US dollars based on a \nformula linked to European gas prices. LOU is negotiating for a longer-term sales contract with \nGazprom and is considering potential sales to the PRC.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n29.  Political, legal, and regulatory risk. The transaction is exposed to Uzbek political, legal, \nand regulatory risk. These risks are perceived to be high in Uzbekistan. Foreign investment and \nproject financing is a  relatively new area in Uzbekistan with very few precedents and the \ngovernment  is  unfamiliar  with  it.  The  country's  legal  and  regulatory  structure  as  well  as \nenforceability of security arrangements remains untested. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n30.  Development  and  operations  risk.  Lukoil  has  experience  in  the  development  and \noperation of gas fields in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, with extensive experience in \nthe  Russian  Federation.  Specifically  LOU  over  the  past  seven  years  has  demonstrated  a \nsuccessful track record in operating and developing gas fields under the PSA in Uzbekistan. \nThe lenders\u2019 debt service will be paid from the cash flows of the Khauzak\u2013Shady field, which \nhas been producing gas since 2007. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n31.  Reservoir  risk.  The  independent  gas  reserves  report  of  Miller  and  Lents  and  the \nlenders\u2019 technical bank9 has verified the adequacy of proven gas reserves. The fact that lenders\u2019 \ndebt service will be paid from the cash flows of the Khauzak\u2013Shady field (a producing field) also \nmitigates the reservoir risk.  \n  \n                                                \n9 Technical bank is the bank which is advising the consortium of lenders on technical matters like gas reservoir. \n ", "8 \n32.  Gas processing and transportation risk. The gas produced at Khauzak\u2013Shady field is \nprocessed at Mubarek GPP, a government-owned plant. The GPP has been operating for over \n30 years and in 1996 enhanced its annual processing capacity to 30 bcm. The Mubarek GPP \nhas been running successfully and processes about 50% of all the natural gas in Uzbekistan; \nwith Khauzak\u2013Shady field accounting for 10% of its total capacity, it has capacity to absorb \nincreased production from Khauzak\u2013Shady field. The pipeline-quality gas that emerges from the \nMubarek GPP is transported to the Kazakhstan\u2013Uzbekistan border through the Central Asia\u2013\nCenter pipeline with a capacity of 50 bcm. The pipeline is owned by Uztransgaz, the national \npipeline company, and has been running well with ample capacity to absorb any new potential \ngas production. Another option in the future is to ship the gas using the Central Asia\u2013PRC \npipeline. The PSA guarantees the priority right of LOU to process raw gas from Khauzak\u2013Shady \nfield at the Mubarek GPP and guarantees unrestricted access to the system of trunk and local \ngas pipelines in Uzbekistan.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n33.  Cash flow risk. The lenders\u2019 base case scenario, which is more conservative than the \nsponsor\u2019s base case scenario, shows that cash flows are robust enough to allow the full debt \namount.  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguard and Social Dimensions  \n34.  The  project  is  classified  under  environment  category  A,  involuntary  resettlement \ncategory B, and indigenous peoples category C under the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nThe potential environmental and social impacts and risks of the project have been identified and \neffective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are \nincorporated  in  the  environmental  impact  assessment.  All  prior  land  acquisitions  were \nundertaken in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement as documented in the ADB \nsocial safeguards compliance audit report.10 The final alignment of the project railway, gas \npipelines,  field  access  roads,  and  transmission  line  have  not  yet  been  prepared;  thus,  a \nresettlement framework was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website.11 These areas are \nsparsely populated and the landscape is vast and mostly uninhabited arid desert land; therefore, \nland acquisition for these facilities is expected to have limited or no impact.
