In 2004, the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment  (USAID)  began  an  initiative  to  promote  environmental  compliance  and \nenforcement in the Asia region. USAID partnered with ADB, Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development, United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), World \nBank, and a selection of Asian governments in this effort. National program assessments were \ncompleted in India, Philippines, and Thailand; and USAID hosted an Asia region forum for \npractitioners in Bangkok.  Planning and Development Collaboration International (PADCO) was \nbrought  on  by  USAID  to  manage  design,  develop,  and  implement  this  effort.  USAID  has \nsolicited ADB leadership to expand this initiative and integrate its results into project-specific \ninterventions.  \n \n2.  ADB believes that this is the right time to expand this initiative. Already a certain amount \nof  momentum  and  awareness  has  been  built  in  the  region  toward  the  idea  of  building \nenvironmental compliance and enforcement capabilities. To capitalize on this attention, guiding \nprinciples, best practices, and performance measures recognized though this process must be \ninternalized  into  existing  administrative  and  legal  systems.  ADB  offers  the  ability  to \noperationalize many of the key elements of this initiative through its projects, and to elevate the \nregional  aspects  of  environmental  compliance  and  enforcement  where  appropriate.  This \nregional technical assistance1 (TA) was proposed to the Governance Cooperation Fund and \napproved  for  financing  in  October  2004.  It  will  reduce  corruption  and  inequalities  in  the \nenforcement of environment laws, and promote the rule of law to improve the environment and \nthe health of people who rely on it.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Asian  economies  face  serious  environmental  problems  caused  by  increasing \nurbanization  and  industrialization.  While  each  country  has  made  considerable  progress \nestablishing  environmental  regulatory  systems,  much  work  remains  in  strengthening \nenvironmental enforcement, due to legal, institutional, and capacity limitations. In particular, \ngovernments  face  continuing  challenges  in  reducing  overlapping  authorities,  decentralizing \nenvironmental functions, training core staff, raising awareness of the regulated community, \nattracting necessary funds, and reducing opportunities for corruption. \n \n4.  Environmental degradation has an especially detrimental effect on the poor who face \ndisproportionate impacts. The poor are more likely to have higher incidences of waterborne \ndiseases,  respiratory  illnesses,  and  contamination  from  exposure  to  chemicals  and  heavy \nmetals. The poor are also more likely to depend on the natural environment for subsistence as \nin the case of many living in the Greater Mekong Subregion. For those affected, breaking the \ncycle of poverty is much more difficult. By making environmental compliance more practical and \nenforcing environmental laws already in place, governments will be able to reduce pollution and \nimprove the health of those who are most exposed. Reducing the incidence of disease among \nthe poor will help increase their productivity and opportunity to earn more. \n \n5.  Limited human and institutional capacity poses a major challenge for decision makers \nimplementing and enforcing environmental requirements. While most countries have adequate \nlaws and institutions to regulate and control environmental pollution, implementing agencies \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities on 14 October 2004. \n   ", "2   \nlack the necessary resources, including training capabilities to ensure effective implementation. \nBuilding capacity is at the heart of strengthening environmental compliance and enforcement. \nSharing lessons learned among regional counterpart agencies and practitioners can be an \neffective strategy to build capacity. \n \n6.   Decentralization of environmental functions remains a top priority for regulatory agencies \nin Asia. Strengthening regional, provincial, and local agency authority and capabilities is critical \nto efforts to promote improved environmental compliance and enforcement. While decentralizing \nenvironmental functions for each country requires coordinated approaches that reflect legal, \ninstitutional,  and  administrative  constraints,  countries  face  common  challenges  and  often \ndevelop new solutions that are directly relevant to counterpart agencies in the region.   \n \n7.  Recognizing limited resources available to implement command-and-control regulatory \nsystems, Asian governments have been developing innovative strategies and pilot activities to \npromote  environmental  compliance  though  civic  engagement,  enabling  community-based \norganizations, and facilitating market forces. Economic instruments such as pollution charges \nand revolving environmental funds have proven effective within Asian countries for promoting \ncompliance, while generating new financial resources to support agency capacity strengthening. \nLikewise, leveraging media and markets through public disclosure programs that publicize both \ngood  and  poor  environmental  performance  are  now  recognized  as  important  tools  for \nsupplementing traditional command-and-control regulatory approaches.  \n \n8.  Citizen  enforcement  of  environmental  laws  has  proven  an  effective  means  for \nempowering citizens and communities to promote improved environmental compliance. Citizen \nmonitoring and citizen grievances are also important for ensuring transparent and accountable \ndecision making on environmental management. Leveraging citizen involvement has proven to \nbe key to improving governance systems with applications beyond environmental management.  \n \n9.  Practitioner networks have proven to be successful mechanisms for agency officials and \nother  stakeholders  to  exchange  information  and  experience  on  effective  and  innovative \nenforcement policies and practices. Mutual cooperation through networks provides a useful \nfoundation for addressing common challenges, including transboundary pollution and trade, and \nsharing innovative solutions. The objectives of practitioner networks include supporting regional \nsharing of best practices, promoting development and implementation of improved policies and \ninstitutions,  and  strengthening  overall  practitioner  capacity.  Lessons  learned  from  existing \nnetworks and Asian regional workshops are that practitioners are key players in developing \npractical solutions to enforcement and compliance challenges, and that Asian practitioners are \nwilling to devote their time and effort to address these challenges.  \n \n10.  Participating  countries  and  development  agencies  have  found  value  in  providing \nconsistent  support  for  environmental  compliance  and  enforcement  practitioner  networks. \nExisting  networks  supported  through  external  support  include  (i)  International  Network  for \nEnvironmental Compliance and Enforcement (INECE), (ii) Balkan Environmental Regulatory \nCompliance  and  Enforcement  Network,  (iii)  Regulatory  Environmental  Programme \nImplementation  Network,  and  (iv)  European  Union  Network  for  the  Implementation  and \nEnforcement of Environmental Law. This TA will develop a proposed program and operations \nplan for consideration by funding agencies.   \n \n \n \n ", "    3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The goal of the TA is to support effective implementation of environmental laws leading \nto improved environment and health conditions for the poor. Its purpose is to (i) strengthen \ninstitutional  and  practitioner  capacity,  (ii)  improve  citizen  participation  in  environmental \ncompliance  and  enforcement,  and  (iii)  capture  and  share  innovative  solutions  and  best \nenvironmental compliance and enforcement models in the region. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  Identify  Country  Enforcement  and  Compliance  Program  Challenges  through \nNational Program Assessments. The TA will complete program assessments in Sri Lanka and \nViet Nam, following the USAID model of assessments in India, Philippines, and Thailand. These \nwill be done in partnership with host country governments and other development partners. The \nTA will identify (i) baseline compliance and enforcement program needs and challenges, (ii) \nshort-term  recommendations  for  implementation  within  existing  legal  and  institutional \nframeworks,  and  (iii)  long-term  recommendations  requiring  legal  reform.  Short-term \nrecommendations  will  support  strategic  pilot  demonstration  activities  at  the  country  level. \nBaseline studies will enable comparative analysis across countries and support regional sharing \nof best practices and lessons learned. Potential additional baseline studies will need to be \nfunded with supplementary partner funding.  \n  \n13.  Establish Regional Practitioner Network. This TA will contribute to the establishment \nof a regional compliance and enforcement practitioner network, designed in consultation with an \nexecutive committee comprising relevant partners and experts including funding countries and \nparticipating  countries.  A  detailed  program  development  plan  will  be  prepared  to  outline \nproposed functional, operational, and budget options to sustain this initiative. The region initially \ncovered by the network will include East, South, and Southeast Asia. At a workshop in mid-2005 \nin Manila, the TA, in partnership with participating countries and funding agencies, will establish \nthe network and consider endorsement of the mission, institutional structure, and work program \noutlined in the program development plan. Institutional arrangements could include a governing \nboard, national coordinators, and membership requirements. The network will provide a platform \nfor practitioner exchange on a range of topics, including permits and monitoring; institutional \narrangements  and  decentralization;  enforcement  actions  and  response;  citizen  monitoring, \npublic  participation,  and  enforcement;  economic  instruments  and  public  disclosure;  judicial \nstrengthening;  program  monitoring;  and  regional  guidelines  and  program  integration.  The \nparticipation of development partners in the network will ensure coordinated network design and \nadvance sustainable strategies in the work program. \n \n14.  Develop Country-Level Compliance and Enforcement Program Indicators. Through \nnational consultations and a regional workshop, the TA will develop national compliance and \nenforcement  program  indicators  for  use  in  assessing  program  progress.  By  developing \ncompliance and enforcement indicators, participating countries will identify key strategies for \nmeasuring program outputs, outcomes, and impacts. In finalizing indicators during the regional \nworkshop,  countries  will  improve  their  proposed  program  indicators  through  counterpart \nexchange and consultation with USEPA and other outside experts, before adoption by their \nnational government agencies. Indicators will enable the countries and funding agencies to \nmeasure progress during the life of the TA and beyond. \n \n   ", "4   \n15.  Develop and Implement Improved Environmental Policies and Practices through \nPilot Demonstrations. Based on the country assessments (para. 12), the TA will support \ndevelopment of country-based pilot demonstration projects on improved policies and practices. \nPilot activities will be high priorities of selected countries, and will offer important opportunities \nfor  replication  in  the  region.  Core  program  areas  for  demonstration  will  include  innovative \napproaches for stakeholder participation and economic instruments. Pilot demonstration will \nleverage  national  government  and  participating  funding  resources  to  ensure  policy \nimplementation on the ground. Agency partners will share results at regional and national \nworkshops.  \n \n16.   Strengthen Practitioner Capacity through Training. Based on priorities identified in \nthe  country  assessments,  network  work  program  and  demonstration  pilot  projects,  in \npartnership  with  other funding agencies (notably  USEPA and INECE), the TA will support \nprovision of specialized regional training for interested practitioners on improved environmental \ncompliance and enforcement policies and practices. Practitioners could include national forest \nand  environment  officers,  legal  nongovernment  organizations,  prosecutors,  judges,  and \nacademics. Practitioner training will provide obvious economies of scale and will be integrated \nwith all other program activities ensuring implementation of high priority policies and practices \nthat address key challenges identified in the country assessments. A diagnostic training needs \nassessment and work plan will be completed as part of the program development plan for the \npractitioner network.  \n \n17.  Share Innovative Solutions and Best Practices within the Region. To accomplish \nthis output, the network will organize an annual regional forum to present case studies and \nshare  best  practices  with  practitioners  and  stakeholders.  The  annual  forum  will  include \npresentations on results from pilot activities, as well as specialized practitioner training. In \npartnership with other development efforts, the TA will support development and maintenance of \na  web  site  that  will  share  best  practices  and  provide  links  to  other  relevant  international \nnetworks addressing environmental enforcement and compliance. The network will also develop \nresource materials based on demonstration and other activities. National coordinators within \neach country and the network executive committee will be responsible for promoting interest in \nand inputs to the network. Stakeholder meetings will also be coordinated to share information \ngathered  and  developed  under  this  TA,  and  to  leverage  activities  in  the  region  affecting \nenvironmental compliance and enforcement issues. \n \n18.  Promote  Regional  Cooperation  on  Trade  and  Multilateral  Environmental \nAgreement Implementation through Regional Enforcement Guidelines. To promote uniform \nenforcement  of  world  class  standards  and  multilateral  environmental  agreements  across \ncountries, the network will develop regional guidelines on compliance and enforcement for \nadoption  by  participating  countries.  Regional  guidelines  will  reflect  special  conditions  and \ninterests (e.g., citizen participation) identified by participating countries. The network will use the \nguidelines as an important tool in promoting regional cooperation and exchange. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $730,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $250,000. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Governance Cooperation Fund. USAID will \nprovide $300,000, USEPA $50,000, Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development \n$40,000, and World Bank $20,000. INECE will provide in-kind support of $20,000 equivalent. \nParticipating governments will make in-kind contributions in the form of office space, local travel, \nremuneration  of  counterpart  professional  and  support  staff,  cost  of  data  acquisition,  office ", "    5\nfacilities  and  utilities,  use  of  available  equipment,  and  all  data.  These  contributions  are \nestimated at $50,000 equivalent in total. Detailed cost estimates are presented in Appendix 2. \nFunds from other external funding agencies will not be funneled through ADB. Each agency will \ndirectly fund the elements they are supporting.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The TA is an extension and expansion of an existing USAID-initiated project. Since its \ninception, USAID has engaged PADCO, Inc. to implement this initiative. PADCO successfully \nimplemented the project and has proved to have the necessary global, regional, and national \nexpertise to provide the required technical and operational inputs. ADB wants to build on the \nsuccesses PADCO has achieved in the initial stages of this initiative. For this TA, PADCO will \nprovide its services on a not-for-profit basis, and will submit quarterly statements of expenditure. \nTo ensure a seamless and immediate transition, and a consistent and coordinated approach as \nadditional countries and organizations are integrated into the network, PADCO will be appointed \nby direct selection to deliver the required services and implement the TA. The TA will be \nimplemented over 2 years from March 2005 to December 2006. In the event that experts \noutside  of  PADCO  must  be  engaged,  including  domestic  consultants,  the  experts  will  be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Equipment and \nmaterial  will be  procured in  accordance  with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for  Procurement. Domestic \nconsultants will be selected and managed through PADCO. The Agriculture, Environment, and \nNatural Resources Division of ADB\u2019s Mekong Department will serve as Executing Agency for \nthe TA. \n \n21.   A TA steering committee, comprising ADB, USAID, and World Bank representatives, will \nprovide overall guidance and oversight. It will meet twice a year to monitor TA progress. A TA \nmanagement office, to coordinate all TA activities, will be headed by a TA coordinator/chief \ntechnical adviser and set up at PADCO\u2019s regional office in Bangkok. Outline terms of reference \nfor consulting services are in Appendix 3 and the implementation schedule is in Appendix 4.  \n \n22.  With approval from ADB, PADCO will disseminate the expected outputs through the TA \nweb site, quarterly and annual reports, expert reports, review, and terminal reports. The network \nwill develop a comprehensive communications strategy to ensure the dissemination of outputs \nto all stakeholders.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Governance Cooperation Fund for the Regional Environmental Compliance \nand Enforcement Network, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n   ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nTECHNICAL
