INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Second Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program,1 approved by \nthe Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in October 2010, seeks to assist \nsustainable  high  economic  growth  in  Viet  Nam  by  supporting  the  development  and \ncompetitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).2 In the context of the regular \nloan  reviews  conducted,  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  requested  additional  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  the  implementation  of  several  remaining  key  milestones  and  triggers \nincluded in the policy matrix for subprogram 2 of the program. The proposed policy and advisory \nTA will also identify future avenues for ADB support to SME development in Viet Nam, in line \nwith the country\u2019s SME Development Plan, 2011\u20132015. The scope, expected impact, outcome \nand outputs, and implementation arrangements were agreed during a loan review and TA fact- \nfinding mission in March 2012.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.   Healthy levels of private investment will continue to be essential to achieve the 7%\u20138% \neconomic annual growth rate and the 8 million new jobs targeted under Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-\nEconomic Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020. Increasingly, such contribution is expected to \ncome  from  the  domestic  private  sector,  which  is  largely  composed  of  SMEs.  Since  the \nimplementation of the Enterprise Law, 2005,4 the Government of Viet Nam has greatly assisted \nthe development of SMEs with the establishment of a regulatory framework conducive to private \nenterprise. As a result, by the end of 2010, nearly 550,000 enterprises were registered in \nViet Nam, up from 14,500 in 2000. SMEs represented 97% of the country\u2019s total number of firms \nand 46% of gross domestic product. The domestic private sector accounted for 59% of total \nemployment in 2010, up from 29% in 2000.  The growth in the number of private companies has \nbeen followed by sustained increases in the average dimension and productivity of the firms. \nFrom 2000 to 2010, the average capital per firm has increased six-fold, and the average net \nrevenue per employee has tripled. However, the average SME size remains quite small at \n22 employees per enterprise and average capital of D17.6 billion.5 The contribution of SMEs to \ntax revenue is increasingly important. By the end of 2010, of the 336,000 enterprises paying \ntaxes in Viet Nam, 318,000 were private enterprises, 13,000 were foreign-owned enterprises, \nand about 5,000 were state-owned enterprises (SOEs). \n \n3.   Untapped potential. Despite recent progress, SMEs\u2019 potential to generate economic \ngrowth  and  create  employment  opportunities  is  still  largely  untapped.  This  stems  from  a \ncombination  of  factors,  including  limited  access  to  finance,  an  incomplete  regulatory  and \ncompetition policy framework for SME development, and inefficient access to legal services. \nThe TA will address aspects of these larger challenges, essential for the accomplishment of the \nproposed triggers and milestones of subprogram 2 of the program. \n \n4.   SME development is a key pillar of the government\u2019s new Socioeconomic Development \nStrategy, 2011\u20132020, and the Socio-economic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015. SME growth \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster \nand Loan for Subprogram 1 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam: Second Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \nDevelopment Program (Loan 2680-VIE, $40 million). \n2  According to Viet Nam\u2019s definition (Decree 56/2009), SMEs comprise all companies with less than D100 billion of   \nchartered capital ($5 million) and 10\u2013300 workers. For the trade and services sector, the thresholds are lower (10\u2013\n100 employees and less than D50 billion of capital). \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 August 2012. \n4  The first version of the Enterprise Law was approved in August 1999, and subsequently amended in 2005. \n5  Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). 2012. White Paper on Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in Viet Nam  \n2011. Ha Noi. \n ", "2   \n \nremains critical to overcome the structural growth limitations created by the predominance of \nSOEs in Viet Nam. SOEs capture a priority share of public financial resources for investment, \ndespite evidence of low returns on capital and modest employment creation. SMEs can play a \nkey role in improving economic efficiency and sustaining high productivity levels. Realization of \nSMEs\u2019 potential for employment creation requires widening their access to finance and land, \nand improving the regulatory framework for their operations. Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth will \nincreasingly hinge on the capacity of SMEs to boost their competitiveness and carve out a role \nas trusted suppliers in international production chains. \n \n5.   Weak policy and regulatory framework. The policy and regulatory framework for SME \ndevelopment will require the implementation of the second Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \nDevelopment Plan, 2011\u20132015. The sector\u2019s shortage of data, specifically sex-disaggregated \ndata,  has  prevented  the  formulation  of  gender-sensitive  SME  development  strategies.  In \naddition, participatory processes for policy formulation have only recently been implemented \nand will require further review and effort. Critical pieces of the regulatory framework for private \nsector development, such as the Enterprise Law, 2005 and the Competition Law, 2004, are \nundergoing substantial review to incorporate missing aspects and to close legal loopholes.   \n \n6.   Inadequate access to finance. In spite of recent progress in the reduction of interest \nrates  by  commercial  banks,  access to finance  remains a  long-standing  limitation for  SME \ndevelopment. After initial progress, the implementation of viable and sustainable market-based \ncredit guarantee systems is still at the early stages. SMEs have limited access to conventional \nbank lending6 and face a shortage of alternative financial services. Because of their generally \nsmall size and lower sophistication, SMEs face important constraints in accessing both debt and \nequity financing. The sector also lacks specialized financing instruments for SMEs that provide \nincentives to investment in the managerial skills and the information and technological base of \nSMEs in Viet Nam. The approval of the SME Fund in March 2012 may provide such an \ninstrument, but its operating guidelines still need to be developed.7  \n \n7.  Poor access to legal support and protection. A recent study8 underlines the growing \nconcern of the domestic business community about a perceived lack of access to legal services, \nwhich extends from access to legal texts to more specialized consultations. The implementation \nof Decree 66/2008 on Legal Support to Enterprises is progressing slowly. In particular, the \nnewly created department at the Ministry of Justice in support of SME legal services lacks \nstrategic focus, and it is likely largely underfunded for the important demands on its staff. \n \n8.   Cumbersome administrative procedures. SME development continues to be affected \nby a large number of administrative procedures that increase companies\u2019 compliance costs and \ndeter new start-ups. These procedures include cumbersome customs requirements that delay \nthe  release  of  imported  goods  and  alter  production  processes.  Permanent  institutional \nmechanisms to control and simplify administrative procedures for SMEs are required. Improving \nSMEs\u2019 competitiveness will require conducting regulatory impact assessments of new legal \ndocuments affecting SME development and operations.  \n \n9.   Implementation Progress under the SMEDP. Despite adequate progress towards the \nimplementation of the set of policy triggers and milestones incorporated in the policy matrix, \n                                                \n6  Only 5%\u201310% of SMEs can afford the commercial banks\u2019 interest rates and receive bank loans, although recently \nrates have decreased somewhat as inflation subsides. \n7 The SME Fund will aim to provide financial support to SMEs with feasible investment proposals in the areas \nprioritized by the state, with a focus on employment creation, enhancing the competitiveness, and implementing \nthe objectives of the SME Development Plan, 2011\u20132015. \n8  USAID/Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 2012.

The TA will \nsupport both the implementation of remaining reform milestones under subprogram 2 of ADB\u2019s \nProposed Second SME Development Program, and of the post-program partnership framework. \nThe TA will also open new ground for future ADB financial assistance in several areas, such as \nthe potential for public\u2013private partnerships for SMEs, or the provision of legal support services \nto SMEs. Beyond subprogram 2, additional financial support to SME development in Viet Nam \nmight be better articulated along more specific challenges (e.g., legal support or support to land \nreform) rather than through comprehensive upstream policy-based lending programs. \n \n10.   Lessons. ADB has directly assisted the government\u2019s efforts on SME development \nthrough a combination of policy-based cluster loans and TA.9 An important lesson learned by \nADB is that SME development will largely be affected by a series of parallel reforms in the \ncountry\u2019s financial and economic structure. ADB has been supporting Viet Nam\u2019s economic \nreforms through programs aimed at SOE restructuring, microfinance industry development, and \nfinancial sector reform that are likely to have an important effect on private sector development. \nADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 and the country operations business plan, \n2012\u2013201410 specify private sector development as a key priority for sustainable and inclusive \neconomic  growth.  Continued  support  to  reforms  and  engagement  has  also  shown  to  be \nessential to assist progress in the sector. ADB loans have been processed as clusters to ensure \na medium-term focus, while reforms have been consistently assisted by high-level TA. The TA \nwill include an innovative approach to assisting Viet Nam\u2019s private sector development, while \nbuilding on lessons from earlier initiatives.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  a  business  environment  that  supports  greater  SME \ncompetitiveness. The outcome will be the implementation of key measures under the policy \nmatrix for the program, and of strategic initiatives identified in the post program partnership \nframework. An expanding SME sector will generate more and better jobs, and contribute to \nsustainable poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  Core  result  area  1:  Enhancement  of  the  regulatory  framework  for  private \nenterprises in Viet Nam. Major activities in this area will comprise advisory assistance to the \nreview  of  the  Enterprise  Law,  2005,  including  the  integration  of  provisions  on  corporate \ngovernance and mergers and acquisitions into the law, which undergoes its second major \nreview since approval in 1999. Assistance will also be provided for the preparation of the \nrequired regulatory impact assessment (RIA) on the amended law. The RIA will be developed \non the basis of government guidelines for such assessments, which were completed in 2012 \nwith ADB assistance. \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2004.

Core result area 2: Strengthening the framework for competition policy. Activities \nunder this component include assisting the institutional development of the SME Legal Support \nDepartment of the Ministry of Justice with best international practices. The department will play \nan essential role in facilitating improved access to legal services for SMEs in Viet Nam. Private \nsector representatives have identified this issue as a key policy priority. It has, additionally, been \nhighlighted as a key strategic initiative under the post program partnership framework (P3F), \nand an area for potential ADB support in the future. The TA will help identify the role of the \ndepartment and the definition of its strategic plan. In addition, the TA will support the upgrading \nof the SME portal to help SMEs access legal documents\u2014a long-standing concern of the \nbusiness community; this will be coordinated with the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) \nSME portal work. \n \n14.   The  TA  will  support  the  review  of  the  Competition  Law  and  the  preparation  of  its \nassociated RIA. The review of the Competition Law is in its final stages and amendments are \nbeing  considered  to  the  law  and  its  implementing  regulations  that  will  require  an  impact \nassessment. \n \n15.   Core  result  area  3:  Improving  access  to  finance  for  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises.  This  will  be  achieved  by  upgrading  the  SME  portal  to  produce  relevant  and \nregularly  updated  information  on  supply  and  demand  for  financial  services  for  SMEs.  An \nimportant addition to be supported by the TA is the preparation of a self-assessment tool for \nSMEs that would assist their dealings with financial institutions when accessing loans. \n \n16.   As an innovative aspect of ADB assistance to SME development, the TA will provide \nadvisory assistance for exploring the potential of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) for SMEs \nas an alternative strategy to leverage investment funds. This knowledge product will include \n(i) an assessment of Viet Nam\u2019s regulatory framework for PPPs, and benchmark it with best \ninternational practices; (ii) the identification of sector potential for the development of PPPs with \nSME  participation;  and  (iii)  outlining  proposals  for  the  implementation  of  the  policy \nrecommendations. As in the case of the assistance provided to the development of systems for \nthe provision of legal support to SMEs, this initiative addresses a critical aspect of the P3F, and \nopens up new ground for future ADB involvement in this critical area of reform. The TA will also \nsupport the drafting of operational guidelines for the SME development fund\u2014a new financing \nmechanism for SMEs managed by the MPI.

Successful implementation of the TA will require the government to stay on course with \nkey  macroeconomic  reforms  and  business  regulatory  reforms.  In  addition,  adequate \ncoordination among government agencies in the implementation of the different, interrelated \nactivities will be needed. The relatively weak capacity of government agencies to implement \nreforms  will  be  addressed  by  the  contributions  of  high-quality  international  consultants. \nInteragency coordination led by the executing agency will identify vested interests that may \nundermine policy reforms. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office and housing accommodation, office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. Cost \nestimates and a financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  Replicating earlier arrangements, the executing agency for the TA will be the  MPI. \nImplementing agencies include (i) the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) for \nactivities related to the review of the Enterprise Law; (ii) the Ministry of Justice for activities \nrelated to the provision of legal services to SMEs and the development of the SME portal; and \n(iii) Vietnam  Competition  Authority  (VCA)  for  the  review  of  the  Competition  Law  and  the \npreparation of the related RIA. The expected commencement date will be October 2012, and \nthe TA will be completed by December 2013. Disbursements under the TA will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). As some activity costs will be administered by the executing agency, an advance \npayment facility will be used as in prior TA. The TA will employ consultants in a wide range of \nareas, including private sector financing and legal advisory assistance to SMEs. An outline of \nthe terms of reference for the proposed consultants is in Appendix 3. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). Procurement of goods will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). All equipment will be turned \nover to the EA at the end of the TA. \n \nIV.
