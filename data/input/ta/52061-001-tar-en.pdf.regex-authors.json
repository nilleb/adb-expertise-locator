INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) responds to the needs of countries \nin the South Asia Department (SARD) for operationally relevant and timely analytical studies on \nkey issues and challenges that constrain their continued economic growth and development.1  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the strategic objectives of the South Asia Subregional Economic \nCooperation (SASEC) Operational Plan for 2016\u20132025 as it aims to provide the strong knowledge \nsupport  needed  to  harmonize  SASEC  project  interventions  and  priorities  concerned  with \neconomic corridors, transport, trade facilitation, and energy.2 The TA is also aligned with key \noperational directions of the Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u2013\n2020 in that it will support the development of knowledge products for country programs targeting \ninter-subregional regional cooperation and integration.3 It is also fully aligned with Strategy 2030, \nwhich emphasizes strengthening of ADB\u2019s role as provider of operationally relevant knowledge \nproducts.4 Existing country partnership strategies of SARD countries highlight the importance of \nknowledge solutions as an integral part of ADB operations. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  South Asia is one of the fastest-growing regions in the world and has become a global \ngrowth driver. Its gross domestic product  grew by an average 6.7% during 2000\u20132016, and its \ngross domestic product per capita increased at a compound rate of 5.2%, from $751 in 2000 to \n$1,692 in 2016, boosting the region to middle-income status.5 This growth, however, has been \ndriven largely by domestic consumption, and much less by investments and exports, raising the \nquestion of how future growth can be sustained and how gainful jobs can be created for the more \nthan 1 million monthly labor entrants expected over the next 2 decades.  \n \n4.  South  Asian  countries have  been  underinvesting relative  to  their  peers,  posting  an \naverage investment ratio of 32.4% from 2000 to 2017, lower than East Asia and Pacific countries \n(excluding high income) and the People\u2019s Republic of China, which registered an average of 39.5% \nand 43.1%, respectively, over the same period.6 The low rate of investments by SARD countries \nhas translated into inadequate infrastructure and poor connectivity between these countries and \nwith other regions. The policy environment is also inadequate because regulatory institutions and \ngovernance systems are not organized. Most governments in SARD countries have limited \nunderstanding and expertise of development issues and their possible solutions, limited ability to \nprepare investment projects, and weak absorptive capacity. These problems undermine sector-\nbased development, hamper employment growth, and cause laggard regions to fall further behind. \nLifting more than 300 million poor people\u2014equivalent to a third of the global poverty headcount\u2014\nout of poverty will be a huge task.  \n \n5.  To overcome the challenges and sustain the momentum for inclusive economic growth, \nSARD countries have shown increasing demand for well-designed programs and evidence-based \npolicies guided by rigorous analytical and technical studies. From 2012 to 2017, ADB has made \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 May 2018. \n2  ADB. 2016.

(accessed 31 August 2018). \n \n ", "2 \nsignificant progress in meeting this demand via its strong knowledge operations under the SASEC \nProgram and as part of ADB country operations. Several analytical studies were completed under \nvarious ADB TAs, focusing on economic corridors, trade facilitation, global production networks, \nindustry and trade, logistics, monetary aspects, and vulnerability and resilience, among others.7  \n \n6.  These studies informed the formulation of policies and projects to overcome development \nissues in SARD countries. For instance, analytical work on trade facilitation resulted in the \nprocessing and implementation of ADB policy-based loans and/or grants to Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nand Nepal.8 The Government of India committed to develop the East Coast Economic Corridor, \nIndia\u2019s first coastal corridor, to connect the country with global markets and value chains through \nits strategically located ports. ADB supported the three phases of this corridor: Visakhapatnam\u2013\nChennai Economic Corridor, Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor, and Odisha Economic \nCorridor.  The  governments  of  Bangladesh  and  Sri  Lanka  also  adopted  economic  corridor \ndevelopment as a tool to fuel growth and improve the lives of their people, through the Southwest \nEconomic Corridor and Colombo\u2013Trincomalee Economic Corridor, respectively. In Bhutan, the \ngovernment established the Department of Macroeconomic Affairs as a result of ADB\u2019s analytical \nwork on macroeconomic monitoring frameworks.  \n \n7.  The analytical studies produced various knowledge products such as working papers, \ntechnical reports, and books.9 These were circulated in the ADB websites, allowing developing \nmember countries (DMCs) to learn from new technical knowledge and lessons, and gain fresh \nperspectives on their own development issues and their own possibilities. The studies were \ncomplemented by capacity-building workshops to ensure the transfer of knowledge to government \nagencies.  \n \n8.  These past analytical works are not meant to be one-off knowledge products and solutions, \nhowever. They are meant to be part of a continuous process of engagement with client DMCs in \nthe region.10 The strong demand from SARD countries for knowledge solutions to development \nissues is driven by several factors.11 First, they find it difficult to translate some of the development \nissues into potential projects because government agencies lack the ability to prepare investment \nprojects. Second, their understanding and expertise of issues and possible solutions is limited. \nFinally, the weak absorptive capacity of their institutions is caused by an unorganized regulatory \nenvironment and governance system.  \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n9  Two flagship knowledge products produced are (i) Scaling New Heights: Vizag-Chennai Industrial Corridor, India\u2019s \nFirst Coastal Corridor; and (ii) Bhutan: New Pathways to Growth. \n10  The TA will coordinate and complement two currently active regional TAs that expire in 2018 and 2019. Since the \nremaining resources of these ongoing TAs are fully committed and cannot cover the various analytical studies \nrequested by SARD countries, the TA will provide additional support but focus on the development issues that have \nyet to be covered. \n11 The discussion of these factors is based on critical reflection and brainstorming by the South Asia Regional \nCooperation and Operations Coordination Division team. \n \n ", "3 \n9.  Faced with these limitations of DMCs and their strong demand for knowledge support, \nADB needs to offer integrated, multidisciplinary solutions that are beyond a single sector and \nthematic group\u2019s purview.12  \n \n10.  Business as usual is not an option, however. To remain relevant and responsive to the \nneeds of the DMCs in the region, selectivity of coverage is crucial. Based on the interests \nindicated by DMCs,13 the possible topics for analytical studies would include the expansion of \neconomic corridors in other states in India; development of coastal shipping and inland waterways; \ndevelopment of economic zones (including tourism zones); links with global value chains and \nglobal production networks; and regional connectivity of South Asia with East Asia and Southeast \nAsia. Lessons from the implementation of various knowledge TAs show that a demand-driven \napproach to knowledge solutions, complemented by capacity building, works well and that \ngovernments respond favorably to policy and project recommendations.14 This is an approach \nthat the TA intends to adopt as well.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: inclusive economic growth and regional \neconomic integration among SARD countries improved and sustained. The TA outputs will result \nin the following outcome: knowledge solutions adopted by SARD countries.15  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  The TA will enable ADB to undertake operationally relevant analytical studies on key \nissues and challenges faced by SARD countries, using an integrated, crosscutting, thematic, and \nmultisector approach to development that goes beyond narrow sector approaches.16 The TA will \nallow ADB to respond quickly to the client countries\u2019 demand for knowledge support; identify \ncrucial and immediate investment requirements; and facilitate their inclusion in ADB lending \noperations that can contribute to the proposed development impact. The TA will strive to make \ninnovation and high-level technology transfer an integral part of knowledge outputs. These TA \nundertakings will support the post-2015 sustainable development agenda with a strong focus on \ncontributing to inclusive growth and employment creation.  \n \n13.  Output 1: Integrated and multidisciplinary knowledge solutions created. This output \ninvolves differentiated approaches to meeting SARD countries\u2019 demand for knowledge support \nby exploring innovative and customized solutions. The solutions will be demand-driven, based on \nthe policy challenges identified, and fed by continuous dialogue between ADB and its client DMCs. \nThe output will also support the implementation of the recommendations outlined in the SASEC \n                                                \n12  ADB (Office of the President). 2018.

It will collect sex-disaggregated data as part of the (proposed) feasibility \nstudies, with gender and development elements to be included, as feasible, in the ensuing pipeline projects in line \nwith ADB processes, practices, and the Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects (2012).  \n \n ", "4 \nOperational Plan and SASEC Vision.17 It will include concrete analytical studies with substantial \npolicy advice and recommendations.18 \n \n14.  Output 2: Knowledge sharing, dissemination, and learning events enhanced. The \nTA will organize various learning events that will help generate, share, and apply knowledge. This \nincludes activities such as forums,  consultation workshops, and study  visits, which  will be \norganized in partnership with more advanced countries\u2014e.g., the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nJapan,  and  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2014to  draw  on  their  experiences  on  formulating  strategic \napproaches to development. The output will give SARD countries useful directions for their own \ndevelopment path.19 Other learning events will promote inter-regional knowledge sharing.     \n \n15.  Output 3: Translation of knowledge solutions into project pipeline strengthened. \nThe TA will give ADB the means to improve project readiness and enable proactive portfolio \nmanagement, and thereby fostering and facilitating swift delivery of development outcomes. \nAnalytical studies will progress in parallel with project identification and implementation, readiness, \nand implementation. Strong upstream analytical work will provide the foundation for the project \ndesign, with a focus on identifying potential projects to be linked to ADB regional and national \nlending pipelines (footnote 16).  Ultimately, project identification and prioritization will be translated \ninto the respective country\u2019s multiyear operational plan. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $5,000,000, of which (i) $4,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6), and (ii) $500,000 will be financed \non  a  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.   \n \n17.  Civil works, the procurement of large-scale equipment, permanent staffing costs, and the \nhiring of staff consultants are ineligible expenditures under the Republic of Korea e-Asia and \nKnowledge Partnership Fund. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will administer the TA through the South Asia Regional Cooperation and Operations \nCoordination Division. ADB will work closely with ADB resident missions in SARD countries and \nvarious  government  agencies  in  implementing  the  TA  activities.  The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2016.
