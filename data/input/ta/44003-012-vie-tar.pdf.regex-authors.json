INTRODUCTION \n1.  In 2009, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched a sanitation dialogue1 between \nADB and the developing member countries. The objective of the workshop was to provide a \nforum for issues associated with poor sanitation, in order to take up the sanitation challenge and \navert a crisis in the making. Viet Nam followed suit by organizing an In-Country Sanitation \nDialogue in April 2009 to discuss its own specific sanitation issues, and practical and affordable \nsolutions.  The  2010  Viet  Nam  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Assessment,  Strategy,  and \nRoadmap  highlights  that  urban  wastewater  management  is  lagging  overall  urban  and \nsocioeconomic development in Viet Nam. Official statistics provided by the Government of Viet \nNam as part of monitoring the Millennium Development Goals indicate that 88% of the urban \npopulation has \u2015access to improved sanitation facilities.\u2016 However, these data give no indication \nof the lack of safe disposal of wastewater that causes health and environmental problems. The \ngovernment has requested ADB assistance to prepare its institutions and agencies for their role \nin delivering urban environmental improvement policies, targets, and programs.  \n \n2.  Following consultation with most of the development partners, ADB and the Ministry of \nConstruction (MOC) met on 20 September 2010 for a technical assistance (TA) fact-finding \nmission to discuss and finalize proposed capacity development TA for Support to Central and \nLocal Government to Implement Urban Environment Improvement Programs2. The TA is the \nfirst step in ADB's long-term engagement with the Government of Viet Nam in general, and \nMOC in particular, on urban wastewater management in Viet Nam. The TA will run concurrently \nwith a series of project preparatory TA during 2011 and 2012, leading to major investment in \nurban wastewater management from 2013.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Less than 10% of urban wastewater in Viet Nam is centrally treated. The majority of \nurban households use inadequately maintained on-site sanitation such as septic tanks, resulting \nin partial treatment and environmental pollution. The continued discharge of untreated and \npartially treated municipal wastewater is a threat to the dwindling freshwater resources of Viet \nNam. The recent water sector review3 concluded that reliable water availability within several of \nViet Nam\u2019s river basins is at risk, especially in the dry season. In a country with about 3,000 \nkilometers of coastline and growing pressure from climate change, coastal areas and coastal \ncities are particularly sensitive, because lots of users rely on self-supply from the underground \naquifer, resulting in microbiological and organic contamination from on-site sanitation systems \nand increased salinity. \n \n4.  The urban population of Viet Nam is growing at one of the fastest rates in Asia, fuelled \nby  a  rapidly  expanding  economy  that  is  largely  built  on  industrialization.  In  such  rapidly \ndeveloping urban areas with increasing population density, and increasing per capita water \nconsumption,  more  environmentally  acceptable  means  of  wastewater  disposal,  and  proper \noperation and maintenance of on-site and off-site wastewater facilities, are required.  \n \n5.  In recognition of this growing threat to health and environment, the government has \nformulated ambitious targets to have 70% of cities equipped with adequate sewerage systems \nby 2025. Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 1930/2009.4 The draft Socioeconomic Development Plan, \n                                                \n1  The ADB\u2013DMC Sanitation Dialogue, held in Manila on 3\u20135 March 2009, brought together 17 countries from Asia \nand the Pacific Region.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 4 November 2010. \n3  ADB. 2009. Viet Nam Water Sector Review. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 4903-VIE). \n4  Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 1930/2009. Approval of Orientation for Drainage Development in Viet Nam Urban and \nIndustrial Zones toward 2025 and Vision toward 2050. \n ", "2   \n2011\u20132015 places considerable emphasis on better performance by the government in reducing \nthe environmental impact of municipal and industrial waste discharge. The cost to meet this \ntarget is estimated at about $20 billion over 15 years (footnote 3).  \n \n6.  As  a  consequence  of  the  government\u2019s  cornerstone  policy  of  decentralization,  the \nresponsibility for urban infrastructure (implementation and operation and maintenance) now \nrests with local governments, whereas, under Decree 88/2007,5 the central government remains \nresponsible for the financing of capital investment. At the same time, the legal framework \nencourages water and sewerage services to operate on commercial principles, enabling local \ngovernments and utility companies to raise tariffs to full cost recovery6 for water supply and cost \nrecovery7 for wastewater, with an allowance for subsidies from the local governments. However, \nmost local governments do not have the financial and technical capacity to manage the scale, \ncomplexity,  and  cost  of  urban  environment  programs.  Many  of  the  urban  environmental \ncompanies (URENCOs) or water supply and sewerage companies are not yet fully prepared to \noperate on commercial principles and attract private sector financing and expertise. Neither do \nthese utility companies have access to capital markets. Massive capacity building effort is \nrequired to implement urban wastewater management systems on a large scale. The TA will \nsupplement the ongoing efforts by various development partners.  \n \n7.  Development partners are financing some urban wastewater improvement programs on \nthe basis of concessional lending and grant funding. Japan International Cooperation Agency \nhas been a pioneer in financing large-scale sewerage projects in Binh Duong, Ha Noi, Hai \nPhong, Ho Chi Minh City, Hue, and Vinh Phuc. The World Bank is assisting the Government of \nViet Nam in formulating a Unified Sanitation Sector Strategy and Action Plan (U3SAP), while \nfinancing sewerage projects in Ho Chi Minh City and several coastal cities and for the upcoming \nUrban Environment Upgrading Program.8 The first examples of central sewerage systems with \nseparate networks are in Da Lat, Lam Dong Province and Buon Ma Thuot, Dak Lak Province, \nsupported by Danish International Development Agency grant funding. Germany is supporting \nan  integrated  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management  program  in  six  provinces,  with \nconsiderable emphasis on capacity building at local level. Finland is supporting water supply \nand sewerage projects in small towns in the northern provinces. The Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development  has  commissioned  the  University  of  Technology,  Sydney  to \ninvestigate  the  economics  of  different  sanitation  options,  resulting  in  a  demonstrated  cost \neffectiveness of decentralized solutions.9 ADB is financing sewerage and drainage projects in \nsecondary  cities.10 ADB  also  maintains  a  dialogue  with  the  Ha  Noi  University  of  Civil \nEngineering  on  technology  options,  in  particular  on  decentralized  wastewater  treatment \nalternatives. In 2010, Viet Nam achieved middle-income country status and the development \npartners are moving to less concessional lending. As such, ADB and the government need to \nprepare a gradual shift in financing the urban sanitation sector from Asian Development Fund \n                                                \n5 \u2015Urban and Industrial Parks Water Drainage\u201d and Circular 09/2009 provide additional details on implementation of \nDecree 88/2007. \n6  Including both capital and operating expenditures, as defined under Inter-Ministry Circular 95/2009, \u2015Guiding \nPrinciple, Determination Method and Jurisdiction To Set The Tariff For Clean Water in Urban Areas, Industrial \nZones, and Rural Populous Clusters.\u201d \n7   Limited to operating expenditures. \n8   Focusing on water and sanitation in secondary cities and due for approval in 2011. \n9   About 50% reduction on capital investment for decentralized options in Can Tho, based on net present value.  \n10 Comprehensive Socioeconomic Development series of urban development projects: (i) ADB. 2006.

THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be to contribute to the environmental sustainability of urban \ncenters in Viet Nam. The outcome of the TA will be better prepared government agencies for \nthe large-scale implementation of urban environmental improvement programs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will prepare central and local government agencies operating in the sector \nthrough training and capacity building to scale up program implementation and move forward \nthe  policy  dialogue  by  (i)  assisting  in  the  drafting  of  the  new  legislation  for  wastewater \nmanagement to supersede Decree 88/2007 and Circular 09/2009 (footnote 5); (ii) providing \nsustainable financing mechanisms, an enabling environment for private sector development, \nand affordable technological solutions in the form of customized road maps for each type of city, \nbased on a comprehensive assessment of the sanitation sector; and (iii) building awareness \nand advocacy of municipal civil society. The TA aims to generate informed debate between \nagencies and individuals involved in specifying and deciding technological and financing options \nfor wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal.  \n \n10.  The TA will be delivered at three levels:  \n \n(i)  central government\u2014in assisting MOC with identifying strategic financial and technical \noptions, designed to monitor sector performance, and with the review of wastewater \nlegislation; \n(ii) local government\u2014in guiding representatives from the departments and agencies of the \nselected cities and provinces on conducting financial assessments, preparing budget \nproposals, and setting tariffs; and \n(iii) water  and  sewerage  companies  or  URENCOs\u2014in  preparing  them  for  their  role  in \ndesigning, planning, and managing wastewater management services, and operating on \nbusiness principles, through on-the-job training. Training will be achieved through the \nprocess  of joint formulation  of  city  sanitation strategies  (CSSs)  for  up  to  15  cities, \nfollowed by more detailed \u2015options studies\u2016 or pre-feasibility studies for a selected group \nof up to five cities or towns. Pilot provinces, cities, and towns will be selected to provide \na reasonable cross-section of socioeconomic and geographical conditions that will form \nthe basis for future ADB lending in the urban environment. An additional criterion will be \na clear commitment by local governments to achieve environmental improvements and a \nreadiness to raise tariffs for better water and sanitation services. \n \n11.  Activities will be implemented in two parts over 24 months.  \n \n12.   Part 1: City sanitation strategies and options studies (18 months). CSSs will be \nprepared for up to 15 cities and towns. The objectives are to (a) provide a rapid assessment of \nthe city\u2019s investment needs and options to improve the urban environment; (b) assess whether \nthe city\u2019s construction master plan and sewerage and drainage master plans are up-to-date and \nflexible enough to allow the phased implementation of a sewerage project; (c) determine the \npreparedness of local government agencies to assume the responsibility for planning, design, \nand operation and maintenance of sanitation; and (d) assess the relevance of key national \n ", "4   \nlegislation on urban drainage and sewerage (in particular, Decree 88/2007) in guiding future \nurban wastewater improvements in urban centers.  \n \n13.  In  developing  programs  and  projects  for  sanitation  improvements,  several  strategic \ntechnical and financial options are available. Constructing conventional centralized sewerage \nsystems in built-up urban areas is extremely complex, disruptive, and costly. Pragmatic and \naffordable alternatives need to be considered based on the outcome from the CSSs.11 Design \napproaches need to consider a phased introduction of affordable environmental improvements. \nSuch considerations include a mix of centralized and decentralized systems, the promotion of \nlow-cost  sanitation  technologies,  separate  versus  combined  wastewater  and  stormwater \nsystems, the segregation or not of municipal and industrial wastewater, sludge and septage \nmanagement strategies, and assessing the reuse of treated wastewater as a potential resource. \nAssessments of alternatives will consider sludge treatment and disposal, and energy usage to \nreduce the city carbon footprint and to contribute to the city climate change action plan.  \n \n14.  Other  dedicated  programs  involve  schools,  reuse  of  water  and  organics,  and \nstrengthening community awareness with a demand-driven approach to technology solutions, \nlevel of service, and tariffs. \n \n15.  Detailed options studies will be conducted at pre-feasibility stage for up to five cities or \ntowns. The options studies will contain comprehensive assessments of the technical options, \nand outline financing arrangements for both capital costs and operating costs, with their subsidy \nand  tariff  implications,  and  an  advocacy  campaign  to  build  awareness  among  the \nrepresentatives of civil society. A critical consideration will be the level of preparedness of the \nurban wastewater and drainage master plans.  \n \n16.  Part  2:  Capacity  building  and  legal  framework  review  (12  months).  Capacity \ndevelopment of local government and URENCO staff will be provided as part of the CSS \nformulation process. Training materials will consolidate the work done by other development \npartners,  especially  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  will  build  on  those \ndocuments. For the central government, capacity development and training will follow a bottom-\nup  approach,  using  the  lessons  learned  from  the  CSSs  and  options  studies,  and  further \nadvance  the  preparation  of  procedures manuals,  which  will  include financial  and technical \nissues for formal government approval. Standard terms of reference will be prepared for use in \nfuture  project preparatory TA projects, highlighting key performance indicators to be monitored \nand sector issues to be considered during project preparation. Those documents will provide the \nbasis for consistent and effective expansion of urban sanitation improvement programs in the \nfuture. National and local workshops will be held to discuss the manuals. \n \n17.  The ongoing assessment of legislation on drainage and sewerage will be consolidated \nand issued as a review of Decree 88/2007 (footnote 5) and its supporting Circular 09/2009. In \ncooperation with MOC and the Vietnam Water Supply and Sewerage Association (VWSA), key \nperformance indicators will be proposed to help monitor progress in reaching national policy and \nurban wastewater targets, as formulated under Decision 1930/QD-TTg (footnote 4) and the \nupcoming Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $2,250,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $2,000,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The Government will finance \n                                                \n11 In 2010, ADB financed CSSs for Dong Hoi City in Quang Binh Province and for Sam Son in Thanh Hoa Province. \nUp to 15 more will be conducted under this CDTA. \n ", "5 \n \nthe  balance  of  the  cost  through  providing  counterpart  staff,  provision  of  office  space, \ncommunications facilities for consultants and other in-kind contributions  (see Appendix 2 for \ndetails of the cost estimates and financing plan). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MOC's Department of Infrastructure will be the executing agency. The people's committees \nand  the  utility  companies  in  the  selected  pilot  provinces  and  cities  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies. MOC will ensure effective coordination with ADB, other central and local government \nagencies involved, and with the key development partners. Coordination will be  bolstered by \nstakeholder workshops that will present and discuss major project outputs and policy issues, \nreview the progress of the TA, and provide directions for strategy formulation. The ADB water team\n12 will assist with the logistics of procurement and management of the individual consultants and \nthe consulting firm, and the dissemination of results through VWSA, Southeast Asia Water Utility \nNetwork, national and international conferences, and publications on ADB\u2019s public website.  \n \n20.  The  TA  will  finance  an  estimated  55  person-months  of  international  consultants  and \n99 person-months of national consultants over 24 months, from December 2011 to December \n2013. International and national consultants will be recruited as individual consultants and through \na firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). The firm is expected to be a national firm and will be chosen, through fixed budget \nselection based on a simplified technical proposal. The tasks to be performed by the firm do not \nrequire a specific expertise and the time and personnel inputs are clearly defined. The firm will \nmanage the provisional sum for logistics and transport; social and technical surveys; translation \nand publication; and results dissemination. Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and will be handed over to the \nexecuting agency, and to the local government agencies and URENCOs involved, at the end of the \nTA. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  The team of consultants will operate under  the guidance of a senior urban sanitation \nstrategy advisor who will ensure continuity with ADB\u2019s policy and strategy for the water and \nsanitation sector in Viet Nam, and liaison between the government, ADB, and the consultants. \nOther specializations covered by the consultants include wastewater management engineering; \nwastewater treatment technology; sewer network collection; wastewater reuse, sludge and septage \nmanagement;  social  development;  public  administration;  and  legal,  public,  and  private  sector \nfinance.  The  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  3.  ADB  will  manage  the  procurement  of \nconsultants and equipment. ADB will seek MOC concurrence prior to recruiting consultants or \npurchasing equipment. \n \n22.  The  TA  outputs,  including  knowledge  products  and  services,  will  be  disseminated  to \nintended users through workshops, electronic reports, website publication, and other means to be \nspecified in a knowledge dissemination and communication plan. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n23.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Government of Viet Nam to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  for  Support  to  Central  and  Local \nGovernments to Implement Urban Environmental Improvement Programs. \n                                                \n12 In 2009, ADB set up a water team of two international consultants and one national consultant to assist with the sector \nwork and with leveraging ADB's lending pipeline in the water and sanitation sector. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions and \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nStronger environmental  New decree on urban  Government decrees and \nPolitical support for \nsustainability of urban  sanitation to supersede  circulars  \nofficial government \ncentres in Viet Nam  Decree 88/2007 enacted   \npolicies and targets on \nby 2015  Sector reports on state of \nurban infrastructure \n  urban sanitation and \nand pollution control \nBetter river water quality  wastewater management; \nindicators: occurrence of  VWSA benchmarks and  More central \n\u2015biological water quality  sector report   government grants to \nindicator\u2016 exceeding A-   provincial \nclass values reduced  Environment ministry and  governments for \nfrom 2010 to 2025  department reports on  investment in urban \nriver water quality; using  wastewater programs \nEVI-10, for QCVN \nProvincial \n08:2008,  A-class \ngovernments prepared \ncomparison \nto enforce tariffs for \n \nwater and wastewater  \n \nRisk \nLack of effective \ncoordination and \nsupport between \ncentral government \nministries \nOutcome      Assumptions \nMOC and URENCOs  Pragmatic government  Correspondence with \nCommitment to \nare better prepared for  regulations and  government, manuals \ndecentralization \nlarger-scale  procedures improved,    \nconcepts  \nimplementation of  accepted and in use by  Record of government \nenvironmental  end of project   decisions on sanitation  Knowledge products \nimprovement programs    planning and financing:  adopted and used by \nin urban areas    (MOC, Ministry of  target agencies \nLending in sanitation  Finance, and provincial \n \nsector increased by 50%  people's committees) \nRisk \nfrom 2010 to 2013   \n  CPM and CPCM  Lack of incentives for \n  subnational \ngovernments to \nassume initiative and \nan executive role in \nwastewater and \nsanitation \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.

Background and Objective  \n1.  The capacity development technical assistance (TA) project is based on the findings of the \n2010  Viet  Nam  Water  Sector  Assessment,  Strategy  and  Roadmap,  which  found  that  urban \nwastewater management was one of the areas with a significant gap between the current coverage \n(less than 10% of urban households) and government targets for the subsector (full collection and \ntreatment of wastewater for cities of Class IV and above, by 2025). The TA design recognizes the \nshortage of relevant skills and experience within those subnational agencies that have been made \nresponsible for dealing with urban wastewater and drainage, and thereby for meeting government \ntargets. Since only a few urban centres in Viet Nam have full sewerage systems, local government \nplanners and decision makers have not been exposed to technology alternatives for wastewater \nmanagement. The TA design further recognizes  that  despite  the  explicit  government  targets, \nwastewater  management  may  not  yet  have  gained  the  full  sociopolitical  priority  required  to \nsuccessfully compete for funding allocations.  \n2.  Reaching government targets will require considerable funding for capital works, as well as \nincreasing and sustained income to fund recurrent costs. As Viet Nam's eligibility for grants and \nconcessional loans declines after having reached the status of a middle-income country, other \nmeans of financing must be determined and developed. ADB\u2019s strategy for the urban wastewater \nsector  in  Viet  Nam  is  therefore  to  gradually  prepare  for  a  broad-based  comprehensive  and \nsustained program that combines strengthening skills and awareness with providing funding, while \nsimultaneously identifying and leveraging additional sources of finance. \n3.  The TA will assist the Government of Viet Nam in preparing the implementation of a large-\nscale  and  long-term  urban  wastewater  management  program  under  the  decentralized \nresponsibility of provincial and city governments. This preparation entails assessing the institutional \nchange, advocacy, and training needs required to support such a program, and introducing funding \nstrategies that can support an \u2015evolutive\u2016 approach to technical design. The TA will make a start \nwith the delivery of advocacy and training, and will define and formulate the structure of the future \nprogram. It will operate at multiple levels of government\u2014central, provincial, and city. \n4.  The TA for urban environmental improvement forms part of ADB\u2019s phased program to help \nthe government achieve its target for urban drainage of stormwater and wastewater:  \n(i)  Two initial city sanitation strategies (CSSs) were established in 2010, assessing data \navailability and investment needs, and discussing broad policy issues locally.  \n(ii)   Thes TA (2011\u20132012) will further determine local technical, institutional, and financial \nneeds, consolidate findings from all pertinent initiatives into a comprehensive sector \nassessment, and define pragmatic and targeted project preparatory TA.  \n(iii)   A project preparatory TA is planned for 2012\u20132013, to formulate a sustainable long-\nterm future loan program.  \n(iv)  Loan funding shall be made available through a multitranche financing facility\u2014a line \nof credit to run from 2013 to 2022, to facilitate the funding of high-priority urban \nsanitation and wastewater management interventions, in the project preparatory TA \ncities as well as other urban areas.  \n(v)   In parallel, ADB will review the provision of guarantees (2013\u20132020) as a mechanism \nto encourage public\u2013private partnerships for the urban wastewater sector. \n5.  The  TA  will  center  on  the  CSS  formulation  for  up  to  15  cities,  followed  by  more \ncomprehensive options studies for five selected cities. The TA is intended to establish a stronger \ninstitutional basis for a future project preparatory TA on urban wastewater management. The TA \nwill:  \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n(i)   encourage  a  focused  and  sustained  policy  dialogue\u2014and  thereby  stronger \ninstitutional awareness\u2014among central government agencies on urban wastewater \nstrategies, involving both technical and financial issues; 1  \n(ii)   highlight  from  direct  experience  the  critical  institutional  constraints  of  subnational \nagencies;  \n(iii)   define a pragmatic mix of finance options to fund a long-term program; and  \n(iv)  document the most suitable technology options for wastewater collection and treatment, \nfor on-site, decentralized, and centralized alternatives.  \n6.  The  TA  will  encourage  government  to  consider  innovative  technical  options  in  urban \nwastewater management, and to disseminate the findings as part of governmental guidelines. \nEngineering approaches should allow for a gradual implementation of infrastructure improvements, \nbased on a \u2015no-regrets\u2016 first-phase investment, e.g., in decentralized wastewater collection and \ntreatment. System designs shall include comprehensive means of dealing with sewage sludge and \nseptage. For parts of the city where septic tanks will continue to be in use, the proposed program \nwill include means to improve their environmental functioning by safely removing and disposing \nsludge. Local reuse of treated wastewater will be encouraged \nB.  Detailed Tasks \n7.  The TA will run for about 24 months, from December 2011, and requires an estimated \n55 person-months  of  international  consultants  supported  by  99  person-months  of  national \nconsultants.  International  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  individual  consultants  and  national \nconsultants through a firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, \nas amended from time to time). The firm is expected to be a national firm and will be recruited \nthrough fixed budget selection based on a simplified technical proposal. The firm will manage the \nprovisional sum for logistics and transport, translation, and surveys. Equipment will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and will be \nhanded over to the executing agency and the local agencies involved at the end of the TA. \n8.  Phasing of tasks. The TA has two partly concurrent parts, with identifiable deliverables \nand milestones. The consultants are expected to make an immediate start on interaction with the \nGovernment of Viet Nam, benefiting from the experience of recently done work on urban sanitation \nand wastewater in the country, as documented in the \u2015Viet Nam Urban Sanitation Issues Paper\u2016 by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Ministry of Construction (MOC).  \n(i)  Part 1\u2014city sanitation strategies and training (18 months).
