Justification\n1. The Government of Mongolia has requested a loan of $30 million from the ordinary capital\nresources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to enhance the research and development\n(R&D) capacity of Mongolian universities. The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) will\nsupport  the  preparation  of  the  program  through  an  in-depth  sector  assessment;  technical\nassessments; economic and financial analyses; financial management and procurement capacity\nassessments;  poverty,  social,  and  gender  analysis;  and  environment  and  social  impact\nassessments.1 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 for\nMongolia.2\nB. Outputs and Activities\n2. Output 1: Science and technology park development strategy, environmental and\nsocial impact assessments, and planning documents prepared. The TA will support the\n(i) review of land availability, transportation and access infrastructure, and current locations of\nindustries, universities, research institutes, and R&D facilities in Ulaanbaatar and second-tier\ncities and their surrounding areas; and (ii) preparation of a strategy for developing science and\ntechnology parks that will guide decisions on the location of R&D facilities, technology transfer,\nlicensing, and/or intellectual property offices, and other facilities for the clusters of prospective\nresearch universities to be supported under output 3. Environmental and involuntary resettlement\nimpacts are expected. The TA will support the review of such impacts and the preparation of an\ninitial environmental examination report and environmental management plan and/or framework,\na land acquisition and resettlement due diligence report, and resettlement plan and/or framework\nfor the program.\n3. Output 2: In-depth assessments of graduate programs and schools, university\nresearch, and funding and governance mechanisms for university research completed.\nThe TA will support in-depth assessments of graduate programs and schools; and university-,\nresearch  institution-,  and  company-based  R&D  funding  and  governance  mechanisms  for\nuniversity research. Based on the assessments, strategies and methods for conducting activities\nto be supported under the program will be prepared. The following will be assessed in depth,\nusing a sample of universities offering graduate programs and, where applicable, research\ninstitutes and companies with in-house R&D functions:\n(i) graduate programs with data on students, university staff (teaching and research\nstaff,  research  support  staff,  management  and  administrative  staff),  degrees\n(students, teaching and research staff, and management staff), fields of study and\nresearch areas, industry partnerships, funding (scholarships and grants), program\ngovernance, management, and quality assurance;\n(ii) doctoral defense committees, and degree-awarding procedures and practices;\n(iii) human resource management systems and practices, including career paths for\nteaching and research staff, and criteria and procedures for recruitment and\npromotion;\n(iv) structure and organization of graduate schools, including charters and statutes,\ngoverning  and management boards,  involvement  of  business  and  industries,\nboard by-laws and procedures, and reporting;\n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 September 2018. \n2  ADB. 2018.

These strategies and approaches will be used to develop a detailed implementation plan\nfor the national program on research universities, and detailed cost estimates. Moreover, a\nstakeholder analysis of policy actions proposed under the national program will be conducted,\nwhich will be considered when determining the financing modality of the program. Additionally, a\nplan to develop the second phase of the national program on research universities will also be\nprepared.

The existing", "3\nsystems and capacity of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Science and Sports (MECSS) will be \nassessed, and potential risks and mitigating measures will be identified. Data on poverty, gender \nand other social aspects of graduate programs, university research, funding and governance \nmechanisms for university research will be collected and analyzed to assess the current situation \nof students, teaching staff, researchers, research support staff, university management and \nadministrative staff, and other direct and indirect program beneficiaries and stakeholders; as well \nas potential positive and negative impacts of the program on various stakeholders. A social \ndevelopment and gender action plan for the project will be prepared. Moreover, cost-benefit \nanalysis and analysis of fiscal impacts and financial sustainability of the project will be conducted. \nBased on these assessments and analyses, the report and recommendation of the President, the \nproject administration manual, and other linked documents will be prepared.  \n7.
