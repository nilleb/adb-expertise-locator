Gross domestic product in Georgia grew at an average annual rate of 5.3% during \n2004\u20132017, supported by reforms to liberalize the economy, mitigate bureaucratic barriers, and \ncombat corruption. Domestic product growth accelerated from 2.8% in 2016 to 4.8% in 2017, \nremained the same in 2018, and is projected to increase to 5.0% in 2019. Georgia ranked sixth \nout of 190 economies in the World Bank\u2019s  Doing Business index in 2018.1 The improved \nbusiness environment is central to the country\u2019s private sector-led development model and has \ninvolved  major  economic  management  and  governance  reforms.  While  the  business \nenvironment  has  improved,  barriers  to  private  sector  competitiveness  remain,  including \nunemployment and a skills mismatch. In 2018, the overall unemployment rate was 14.1%, but \nthe unemployment rate stood at 30.8% for those aged 20\u201324 and 26.6% for those aged 15\u201319.2 \nMore than 40% of employment is in agriculture, fishing, and forestry; the wholesale and retail \ntrade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, education, and industry are also important. \n \n2.  Vocational education and training (VET) programs are offered primarily in vocational \ncolleges  and  community  colleges,  as  well  as  in  a  few  higher  education  institutions  and \nsecondary schools. In 2018, 118 providers offered VET programs: 34 vocational colleges, 51 \ncommunity colleges, 23 higher education institutions, and 10 secondary schools (footnote 2). \nVocational colleges offer the first three levels of VET programs, while community colleges offer \npreparatory  general  education,  liberal  arts,  and  VET  programs.  VET  enrollments  fell  from \n21,000 in 2013 to 11,800 in 2018, partly because of recent changes to VET program structure \nand length. VET enrollments represented only 1.6% of 15\u201324-year-olds. By comparison, 30.7% \nof 15\u221224-year-olds were enrolled in higher education. The Government of Georgia\u2019s ambitious \ngoal is to increase VET enrollments to 11.0% of those aged 15\u221224 by 2021. Private VET is \nsignificant \u2013 representing two-thirds of providers and one-third of enrollments in 2018. \n \n3.  Cultural norms limit female participation in VET and in the labor market, and result in \nsignificant occupational segregation. Fewer young women are in employment (30%) than young \nmen (50%). The labor force participation and employment rates for males are higher than for \nfemales because most young men transition directly from school to work, while most young \nwomen remain inactive for a time.3 The unemployment rate for men is higher than that for \nwomen.  Average  monthly  earnings  of  men  are  higher  than  those  of  women.  There  is \nconsiderable occupational segregation in the labor market, with women making up about 75% of \nemployees in the health care and social sectors and 60% of those in the hospitality sector. \nWomen  account  for  fewer  than  10%  of  construction  workers  and  23%  of  transport  and \ncommunications workers (footnote 2). \n \n4.  Since 2013, the government has focused on improving the performance of the VET \nsubsector, including through the adoption of the VET Strategy, 2013\u22122020 and the Unified \nStrategy for Education and Science, 2017\u201320214 and the passage of the Law of Georgia on \nVocational Education, 2018. The government\u2019s reform program has been accompanied by \nincreased spending on VET and has introduced comprehensive reforms to the VET system. A \nfocus of these reforms and development partners\u2019 efforts has been to better align the VET \n \n1  World Bank. 2018. Doing Business: Georgia Has Moved Up to 6th Place in the Global Rankings.

Despite \nthese efforts, the VET subsector faces the twin challenges of increasing the supply of skills \nwhile ensuring that training is relevant to the needs of the labor market and supports the \ntransition to a higher valued-added economy. \n \n5.  Skills mismatch. The mismatch between the skills produced by the VET system and \nthose required in the labor market manifests itself in various ways, including scarcity of skilled \nworkers,  over-qualification  among  the  employed,  and  a  lack  of  generic  cognitive  and \nsocioeconomic skills. A 2015 labor market survey identified lack of skills as a key reason for \nfirms\u2019 inability to fill vacancies.5 While employers mainly demand workers with technical skills, \nmost job seekers are university graduates (footnote 5). However, a 2014 tracer study of VET \ngraduates  found  that  only  42%  of  graduates  were  in  employment.6 A  survey  of  business \ndemand for skills showed that 92% of firms found it difficult to fill vacancies, and that this was \nworse for technical (blue collar) positions than for professional (white collar) positions.7 The \nmain reason cited was that candidates lacked the required qualifications.  \n \n6.  A 2018 study found evidence of a significant skills mismatch in the Georgian labor \nmarket.8 While students can access higher education, many find it difficult to get a job after they \ngraduate. More than 50% of the unemployed had a secondary school diploma and 40% had a \nhigher education qualification. Graduates lack the technical skills required in the labor market, \nas  well  as  soft  skills  such  as  creative  and  critical  thinking,  problem  solving,  teamwork, \nleadership, and decision-making. Skills gaps in Georgia may worsen given that new economy \nskills  are  in  particularly  short  supply,  and  the  more  dynamic  and  innovative  firms  may \nexperience more significant skills gaps. Skills gaps negatively affect workers and firms by \nreducing earnings potential, job creation, and productivity; and hindering investment (footnote 5). \n \n7.  Poor quality and relevance. A key factor driving the weak performance of the VET \nsubsector is the poor quality and relevance of the VET imparted to trainees. Although Georgia \nranked 45th out of 140 countries on the skills pillar of the Global Competitiveness Index, 2018\u2013\n2019, it ranked poorly on key components such as the extent of staff training (112th), quality of \nvocational training (131st), skillset of graduates (123rd), and ease of finding skilled employees \n(111th). Several factors contribute to the poor performance of the VET sector in Georgia, as \ndiscussed below.  \n \n8.  Lack of private sector and stakeholder participation. The limited engagement of \nemployers and stakeholders has hindered improvements in the quality and relevance of VET \nprograms. In 2009, the government created the National VET Council, a tripartite advisory and \nconsultative body to support VET development and coordinate among government agencies, \nemployers,  trade  unions,  the  nongovernment  sector,  and  VET  institutes.  In  2010,  the \ngovernment created 14 sector committees under the National Center for Educational Quality \nEnhancement,  tasked with  developing  occupational  standards.  These  no  longer  exist.  The \npassage of the Law of Georgia on Public\u2013Private Partnerships, 2018 and amendments to the \n \n5  World Bank. 2015.

", "3 \nLaw of Georgia on Vocational Education, 2018 established a framework to institutionalize VET \ninstitute\u2212industry partnerships, although their use is limited.9 \n \n9.  Poor quality teaching workforce. Attracting, training, and retraining VET teachers are \nmajor challenges for the VET system in Georgia. There is little evidence on the quality of the \nteaching workforce, although stakeholders have expressed concern that most VET teachers \nhave little practical knowledge. There is no pre- or in-service training for VET teachers, although \nthe  Ministry  of  Education,  Science,  Culture  and  Sport  (MOESCS)  is  developing  one. \nProfessional development for VET teachers focuses on pedagogical issues. Low pay for VET \nteachers and a centrally driven pay system make it difficult to attract and retain good teachers, \nwhich exacerbates the situation. The MOESCS is developing a salary scheme that will link VET \nteacher pay to qualifications and industry experience. \n \n10.  Uneven access. Georgia has made significant progress in increasing the geographical \ncoverage of VET provision throughout the country. There is public sector VET provision in all \nregions of the country and private sector provision in all but one region. However, a nationwide \nflexible network of public and private VET providers accessible to all regardless of social status, \ngeographical location, gender, and ability remains a challenge, especially for women, ethnic \nminorities, persons with disabilities, and those in rural areas. The urban\u2013rural divide is growing. \nThe proportion of youth who were not in employment, education, or training in 2013 stood at \n31% for those aged 15\u201324 and 35% for those aged 15\u201329. \n \n11.  Poor image and reputation. As in many other countries, another factor hindering the \ndevelopment of the VET subsector is that it is not seen as an attractive educational pathway for \nskills acquisition. Students and parents see limited value in VET and prefer higher education as \na route to increased lifetime earnings and improved career opportunities. The perception in \nGeorgia is that only students with low grades pursue VET. This is made worse by perceptions of \nthe low quality and relevance of VET and the fact that, until recently, VET studies represented a \ndead end given the lack of links between VET and other levels of education. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n12.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will help prepare the program. The TA is \njustified given the scope of the policy matrix and program activities and the specialized nature of \nskills required in areas such as centers of excellence (COEs) and public\u2013private partnerships.10 \nThe TA will provide technical inputs and assessments. It is also aligned with the proposed \ndirection of the country partnership strategy for Georgia, 2019\u20132023 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), which is expected to be approved in late 2019. The program is in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan for Georgia, 2019\u20132021 as a firm 2020 program; the TA is in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for Georgia, 2019\u20132021 as a 2019 nonlending project. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Detailed policy matrix and program design developed. This output will (i) \ndevelop the policy matrix; (ii) design the program, including COEs, public\u2013private partnership \nprograms,  career  guidance,  secondary  school  VET,  and  competency-based  training  and \n \n9 Government of Georgia. 2018.

Output 2: Program due diligence undertaken. This output will support program due \ndiligence, including the (i) VET sector assessment; (ii) environmental assessment; (iii) economic \nand financial analysis; (iv) gender, poverty, and social analyses; (v) financial management \nassessment  of  the  program\u2019s  executing  agencies;  (vi)  procurement  capacity  and  financial \nmanagement assessments of the executing agencies; (vii) procurement risk assessment and \nprocurement classification; (viii) social safeguards assessments; and (ix) risk assessment and \nmanagement plan. \n \n15.  Output 3: Program processing and implementation start-up facilitated. This output \nwill include assisting in the preparation of all documents required for program processing, \nincluding the (i) report and recommendation of the President and all linked documents; (ii) policy \nmatrix; (iii) project administration manual; and (iv) project start-up and implementation support, \nincluding assisting the executing agency in recruiting project implementation unit staff. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $0.83 million, of which $0.70 million will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of exemptions on taxes and duties, counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other \nin-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA. The MOESCS will be the executing agency. The Social \nSector Division of the Central and West Asia Department will coordinate program preparation \nand implementation with the MOESCS. The TA will be implemented from September 2019 to \nAugust  2021  to  ensure  effective  program  preparation  and  start-up.  The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 1. \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspect  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  September 2019\u2013August 2021 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport \nImplementing agency  The Social Sector Division of the Central and West Asia Department will \ncoordinate project preparation with MOESCS and development partners  \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm: Quality and cost-based  41 person-months: \nselection  19 international and 22 national \nIndividual: Individual selection  consultants \n(technical consultants and \nresource persons, if needed) \nProcurement  To be procured by consultants and/or executing agency \nRequest for quotations   Office  equipment,  furniture;  1-3 \nsmall contracts of about $0.001 m \nDisbursement  Technical assistance resources will be disbursed following ADB's ", "5 \nAspect  Arrangements \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Equipment, information and communication technology-related \narrangement upon technical  accessories, and any furniture purchased will be turned over to the \nassistance completion  executing agency upon completion of the technical assistance. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n18.
