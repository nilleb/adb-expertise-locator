THE ENSUING PROJECT \n1.  The proposed Surkhandarya Regional Road Project will rehabilitate the 111-kilometer (km) \nDerbent  to  Denau  Road  (the  project  road),  linking  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Corridors 3b (Russian Federation to Middle East and South Asia via \nDushanbe) and 6b (Europe to Middle East and South Asia via Dushanbe).  \n \n2.  As a key node in an international road network, Uzbekistan is a contributor to as well as a \nbeneficiary of regional integration to enhance global connectivity, increase international trade and \nultimately diversify livelihoods in Central Asia. Three major CAREC corridors, 2, 3b and 6b, \nprovide connectivity with other Central Asian countries.  By strengthening this link, the project \nroad will support the broader CAREC corridor network and thus contribute to regional integration.  \n \n3.  The core problem of the road subsector in Uzbekistan is inefficient road infrastructure, \nwhich leads to reduced mobility, unsafe roads and limited access to markets and services which \ndisproportionately affect women. The proposed project will contribute to addressing this core \nproblem through two outputs. \n \n4.  Output 1. Derbent to Denau highway section in Surkhandarya region rehabilitated. The \nroad will be rehabilitated to meet an international roughness index of 3m/km. The journey time \nbetween Derbent to Denau will fall from the current 3 hours to 1.5 hours, with average design \nspeeds of 100 km/hr. The improved road will provide Uzbekistan with a higher standard link to \nports in Pakistan. At the national level it will improve domestic connectivity along the road corridor. \n \n5.  Output 2. Institutional capacity of the CR improved and an intelligent transport system \ninstalled and made operational to provide smart and efficient transport mobility. The institutional \ncapacity of CR for managing the core road network, including planning, design and maintenance \nstrategies  will  be  improved.  Training,  workshops  and  manuals  on  road  construction  and \nmaintenance for the road units in the project area will be provided. The intelligent transport system \n(ITS) will be introduced to channel information to the public in real time including presence of \ncollision risks, road conditions, weather conditions, and road works ahead. This will improve \ndriving experience, safety, road capacity, traffic flow and pollution levels. \n \n6.  These solutions will result in the following outcome: The road network in the Surkhandarya \nregion made more efficient and safe. The project will be aligned with the following impacts: \n(i)  implementation  of  targeted  programs  to  build  affordable  housing,  development  and \nmodernization  of  road  transport,  engineering,  communications  and  social  infrastructure \nachieved;1 and (ii) competitive corridors across the CAREC region established. 2  \n \n7.  Overall, the proposed project is aligned with the ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which gives special \nattention to the needs of landlocked economies and supports improving regional connectivity and \ncompetitiveness by addressing cross-border infrastructure needs. It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s \nCountry Partnership Strategy 2019\u20132023 for Uzbekistan.  \n \n8.  The estimated cost of the ensuing project is $200 million. The ADB is considering a loan \nof $180 million from its regular Ordinary Capital Resources to finance the project. Counterpart \nfinancing from the Government of $20 million would finance land and resettlement costs, and \n \n1  Government of Uzbekistan. 2017. Uzbekistan\u2019s Development Strategy for 2017-2021.

The ensuing project is expected to meet the \u201chigh \nreadiness\u201d criteria before Board consideration and help develop the capacity of CR to implement \nthe ensuing project. The TRTA will also develop the appropriate institutional conditions to allow \nthe sound development of the road subsector in future years. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n10.  Output 1: Due diligence and procurement documents for the proposed project \ncompleted. The TRTA will (i) undertake a detailed review of the technical designs for the \nrehabilitation of the project road that have been prepared by the government design institute and \nif need be, propose amendments to the designs to align with ADB and international requirements; \n(ii)  prepare  an  updated  sector  assessment;  (iii)  prepare  economic  and  financial  analyses; \n(iv) prepare required safeguards, social, and gender-related documents; (v) assist the CR with \npreparing the national feasibility study (in accordance with Presidential Resolution No. 3857);4 \n(vi) prepare bidding documents; and (vii) assist the CR with procuring contracts for the works. \n  \n11.  The key deliverables will be bidding documents; safeguards, poverty, social, and gender \nanalysis reports; draft Gender Action Plan; summary poverty reduction and social strategy and other \ndocuments necessary for (i) ADB processing of financing for the project; (ii) the government\u2019s \napproval of the project; and (iii) civil works successfully procured with contracts ready to sign when \nthe project financing has become effective. \n \n12.  Output 2: CR capacity in network management and maintenance, project preparation \nand implementation improved. This output will provide CR with capacity development and training \nprograms on ITS; civil works procurement and contract management for internationally financed \nprojects; and safeguard compliance and monitoring.  \n \n13.  On ITS, the TRTA will help design a system that is best suited to the needs of the project \nroad.  \n \n14.  On procurement, this output will assist CR in conducting the strategic procurement planning \nanalysis. The principles behind ADB\u2019s procurement policy and regulations will be explained, and \nthe  strategic  procurement  planning  analysis  will  be  conducted  to  define  a  fit-for-purpose \nprocurement plan. Training, workshops and manuals on road construction and maintenance for \nthe road units in the project area will be provided.  \n \n \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 August 2019.  \n4  Decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. PP-3857 dated 16 July 2018.
