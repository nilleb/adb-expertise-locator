INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) established its Carbon Market Program in 2006 \n(then called the Carbon Market Initiative) to provide technical support and cofinancing to clean \nenergy projects with greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation benefits.1 The technical support facility \nwas carried out through technical assistance for (i) Preparing Clean Energy Projects Eligible for \nthe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); and (ii) Implementation of the Technical Support \nFacility under the Carbon Market Initiative.2 Both TA projects were designed to assist low-\ncarbon projects in developing member countries (DMCs) to benefit from the single regulated \ncarbon  market  system\u2014the  CDM.  The  successful  implementation  of  the  technical  support \nfacility allowed ADB to scale up from less than 10 projects in 2006 to over 100 projects seeking \nto register as CDM projects in 2012. The proposed TA aims to build on the success of these two \nTA projects and continue to deliver a one-stop technical support facility to ADB\u2019s operational \ndepartments and DMC clients amidst the increasing complexity and developments of carbon \nmarket schemes particularly in 2013-2017 before a new global framework is in place. The \nconcept paper for the TA was approved by the vice-president of knowledge management and \nsustainable development on 16 April 2012 for $5 million.3  \n \n2.  Under  Strategy  2020,  ADB  identifies  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  including \nclimate change, as a top development concern and a core area in its operations.4 ADB\u2019s \nAddressing Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific:  Priorities for Action specifically states that \ninnovative financing, especially including the carbon market, will also be extended.5 The TA also \nhas important links and synergies with a number of ongoing and implemented ADB projects of \noperational departments.6  \n \n3.  The TA will seek to be the knowledge platform for carbon markets. The outputs of the TA \nwill be available through a public information portal so that other initiatives can benefit from the \nexperience and lessons from implementation. The TA will share knowledge and information with \nexisting non-ADB initiatives both within and outside the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change (UNFCCC) structure, other multilateral development banks, and United \nNations (UN) organizations. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n                                                \n1  The Carbon Market Program has three components: upfront carbon financing, technical support facility, and \nmarketing support for carbon credits. The technical support facility provides capacity building, due diligence, \ndocumentation , and implementation support. \n2  ADB. 2006.

The Asia and Pacific region has a key role in addressing global climate change issues. \nDue to rapid economic growth, it is becoming a major source of GHG emissions largely because \nof the increasing demand for energy. Emissions from producing energy in developing Asia have \ngrown by 194% since 1990. Business-as-usual projections by the International Energy Agency \nsuggest Asia\u2019s share in global GHG emissions could increase from 35% in 2009 to 46% by \n2030, surpassing emissions from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \ncountries.7 It is clear that decoupling the region\u2019s growth from carbon emissions is pivotal in the \nglobal efforts to mitigate climate change. \n \n5.  Limited public sector financing highlights the need to mobilize the market for low-carbon \ndevelopment. Enormous investments will be required to meet the growing needs of developing \ncountries while they transit to a low-carbon path. Many studies estimate additional funding \nneeds for climate change mitigation in developing countries to be more than $100 billion per \nyear by 2020, with a significant portion needed in Asia. In November 2010, the UN secretary-\ngeneral's high-level advisory group on climate change financing presented a report on potential \nsources of financial resources to support developing countries in addressing climate change. 8 \nThe report identified the carbon market as one of the feasible long-term financing sources for \ndeveloping countries seeking to fill the gaps in international climate financing.  \n \n6.  In  2010,  the  16th  Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the  UNFCCC  adopted  the  Cancun \nAgreements stipulating GHG mitigation initiatives by the Parties by 2020. In 2011, COP17 \nadopted another milestone agreement to define the second commitment period of the Kyoto \nProtocol and began to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with \nlegal force by 2015 to be implemented in either 2018 or 2020, with decisions on developing new \nmarket-based  mechanisms.9 These  agreements  and  decisions  allow  the  carbon  market  to \ncontinue beyond 2012 and support the emergence of a new carbon market that will not be \nlimited to the CDM. Thus, the DMCs will need capacity building assistance to assess new \nmethodologies,  new  rules  of  implementation,  and  additional  expertise  to  integrate  new \nmechanisms  in  financial  planning.  In  addition  to  direct  project  support,  knowledge-sharing \nplatforms such as workshops, seminars, and e-courses will be helpful for capacity building \ninterventions.  \n \n7.  Domestic emission trading schemes (ETSs) need to be interlinked in preparation for \nscaling up to the regional and global levels. Domestic markets are in place in Asia and the \nPacific, such as in Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand, while many \nDMCs have started to develop their own ETSs, including the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, \nand Viet Nam. To enable cooperation and possible future integration under a regional or global \nmarket, it will be critical to engage in dialogues early in the development of these domestic \nschemes. Different countries with different rules and standards will lead to fragmentation and \nloss of economic efficiency in addressing climate change, and may unnecessarily complicate \nprocedures for potential future harmonization. Technical and policy dialogues would be best \nfacilitated by a third party such as ADB to ensure that the interlinkages among the ETSs are \nindependently analyzed for technical merit and can be practical and sustainable to implement. \n                                                \n7  International Energy Agency. 2011.

While there is little doubt that carbon finance will continue to be a large source of climate \nfunding well beyond 2012, the uncertainty of global climate negotiations, the mix of existing and \nemerging mechanisms, and the combination of international and domestic trading schemes are \nincreasingly making matters complex for DMCs. This transitional period prior to the new global \nframework is precisely the time when multilateral development institutions such as ADB are \nexpected to support DMCs in utilizing carbon financing to maintain the momentum for countries \npursuing low-carbon, environmentally sustainable growth. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n9.  The TA will build on the success of the previous projects to operationalize the technical \nsupport facility under the Carbon Market Program and continue to deliver a one-stop technical \nsupport  facility  to  ADB\u2019s  operational  departments  and  DMC  clients  before  a  new  global \nframework is put in place in 2017. The TA implementation team will track new developments in \nthe carbon market both within and outside the UNFCCC process and will (i) continue to support \nthe  participation  of  DMCs,  especially  the  underrepresented  countries  and  sectors,  in  the \nimplementation  of  CDM  projects;  and  (ii)  facilitate  regional  cooperation  between  emerging \ndomestic ETSs. \n  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  impact  will  be  the  promotion  of  green  growth  and  low-carbon  development  in \ndeveloping Asia and the Pacific through access to carbon markets as a catalytic financial \ninstrument. The outcome will be increased utilization of both existing and new types of CDMs by \nDMCs that will facilitate low-carbon development and the interlinkage of domestic ETSs to \nenhance regional cooperation in Asia and the Pacific in a most cost-effective way.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will develop practical knowledge and experience in carbon market mechanisms \nthat can inform and support DMCs in the implementation of GHG mitigation projects. The key \noutputs will include (i) direct project support and targeted capacity building activities for DMCs, \nespecially the underrepresented countries and sectors in the CDM; (ii) advisory material, and \nreference guides to enhance regional cooperation across domestic ETSs and enable stronger \nlinkages in the future including possible integration; and (iii) workshops for cross-sharing of \nknowledge on the setup and implementation of domestic ETSs.  \n \n12.  Component A:  Clean Development Mechanism Support. COP17 in Durban has ensured \nthe continuation of the CDM beyond 2012. Although CDM support will continue for all eligible \nparties, there is a strong call by a section of developed countries (i.e., the European Union)  to \nsupport underrepresented countries and sectors. The TA will continue to support DMCs in \ndeveloping eligible GHG emission reduction project activities under the CDM and helping to sell \ntheir carbon credits to carbon buyers mainly through (i) the facilitation of the development of \nCDM projects in DMCs with special emphasis on underrepresented countries and sectors; \n(ii) assistance to develop a standardized baseline as a useful tool for the implementation of \nCDM projects; (iii) the development of methodologies and tools for underrepresented project \ntypes  such  as  demand-side  energy  management,  transport,  and  land  use;  and  (iv)  the \nfacilitation of more targeted training of local experts to enable DMCs to implement CDM projects \non a more sustainable basis. The ongoing collaboration with UN agencies and other partners, \nsuch  as  the  UNFCCC,  the  UN  Environment  Programme,  and  the  Institute  for  Global \n ", "4   \nEnvironmental Strategies (Japan), will be enhanced to promote the CDM in Asia and the Pacific \nin a much more concerted way.  \n \n13.  Component B:  Domestic Emission Trading Market Linkage. Several DMCs in the region \nare developing their own ETS including the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and Viet Nam. \nThis component will support knowledge-sharing on domestic ETSs among interested DMCs, \nassess the feasibility of regional interlinkages among ETSs, and facilitate the linkages in the \nregion by (i) conducting workshops and training courses; (ii) carrying out feasibility studies on \nregional  interlinkage  among  the  domestic  ETSs;  and  (iii)  facilitating  policy  and  technical \ndialogues among interested countries with ETSs to develop advisory materials and possible \nguides and technical references. \n \n14.  The major assumptions and risks are identified in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1). To minimize these risks, the TA will (i) monitor developments in the international \nand regional arenas in climate change actions and project activities; (ii) adopt a flexible project \ndesign, including in its governance; (iii) adopt a participatory and consultative approach in \nproject planning, design, and implementation among stakeholders to ensure strong ownership; \n(iv)  where  necessary,  forge  formal  agreements  such  as  memoranda  of  understanding  or \nagreements to define key responsibilities; and (v) tap existing networks to identify and engage \nqualified experts for the project. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $950,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV), and (ii) $450,000 will be financed \non  a  grant  basis  by  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Fund.10 Funding  from  the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Fund will be used only for component B activities for \nwhich the fund confirmed its allocation. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  with  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department responsible for implementing it. The initial implementation period of \nthe TA will be from December 2012 to December 2013 with a possibility of extension based on \nthe funding situation. \n  \n17.  The  TA  will  require  35  person-months  international  and  25  person-months  national \nindividual  consultant  inputs.  Appendix  3  provides  the  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants. Individual consultants will be recruited because of the need for specialized and/or \ncountry-specific expertise. ADB will engage consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The procurement of equipment \nand  other  supplies  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). The turnover or disposal of equipment purchased under the TA will \nbe in accordance with the relevant ADB guidelines. Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \n18.  ADB will engage a team leader to provide guidance to the team members, coordinate all \ninputs from all consultants under the TA, and ensure the overall timely delivery of the key \n                                                \n10  Established by ADB. \n ", "  5 \noutputs. A team of international and national experts will support the team leader and interact \nclosely with the operations departments for feedback on particular areas or sectors requiring \nassistance. The team will coordinate with operations departments during TA implementation to \nensure that the TA complements its current and planned efforts to carry out national climate \nchange priorities, and with support departments like the Central Operations Services Office, \nController\u2019s Department, Office of Cofinancing Operations, and Office of the General Counsel to \nmeet implementation requirements including funds disbursements, utilization, and reporting. \nThe team will also work and liaise with partner organizations. Lessons learned will be accessible \nto  interested  parties  internally  and  externally  to  facilitate  and  support  future  capacity \ndevelopment efforts. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $950,000 on a grant basis for \nSupporting the Use of Carbon Financing to Promote Green Growth in Asia and the Pacific, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nGreen growth and low  Reduction in greenhouse  Investment  DMCs will have access \ncarbon development in  gas emissions intensity  development reports   to concessional financing \nADB\u2019s DMCs promoted  among DMCs by 25% in    for green growth \n  2013-2025 (1990\u20132002  UNFCCC website  projects.  \nbaseline: 12%)     \n    All DMCs have equal \n    opportunity to participate \n  in all emission trading \nschemes. \n \nRisks \nLack of capacity in \ncertain DMCs to develop \nand sustain green \ngrowth initiatives, \nparticularly in emission \ntrading schemes. \n \nLack of government buy-\nin of the advantages of \nparticipating in green \ngrowth initiatives. \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncreased utilization of both  Number of projects and/or  CDM executive board  DMCs will have policies \nexisting and new types of  investments in supporting  report  that will encourage and \ncarbon market mechanisms  DMCs using carbon    support the creation of \nby DMCs   markets increase by 10%  UNFCCC website  carbon markets.  \nannually compared to     \n2008\u20132012  Government and public  Risks \n  information sources  International negotiations \n    may not yield expected \n  results, or the carbon \nmarket may collapse, \nthereby reducing \nincentives to DMCs. \n \nLack of available \nresources such as \ninvestment, domestic \ncapacity for market \ndevelopment, and data \ncollection skills. \n ", "   Appendix 1  7 \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
