INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During  discussions  on  the  country  operations  business  plan  for  Mongolia,  the \nGovernment asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB), for technical assistance (TA) for Policy \nand Institutional Support for Banking Sector Systemic Risk Management. A fact-finding mission \nvisited Ulaanbaatar from 29 July to 4 August 2009, and an understanding was reached with the \nGovernment on the TA objectives, scope, terms of reference, cost estimates, financing plan, \nand implementation arrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Banking Crisis. Mongolia has been hit by a combination of worsening terms of trade \ndue to a fall in copper prices, and subsequent rapid slowdown of domestic growth. Gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth is expected to slow markedly from 9% last year to 0.3% in 2009. \nBecause of this economic downturn, the banking sector in Mongolia is heading for a systemic \ncrisis.2 The sector\u2019s nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio, including past due loans, is reported to be \nmore than 19% for July 2009, up from 5% in June 2008 (Table 1); and is expected to reach 30% \nby the end of this year.3 Total outstanding loans declined by 6% in nominal terms between \nSeptember 2008 and June 2009, although inflation was in double digits during most of this \nperiod.  \n \nTable 1: Nonperforming Loans in Mongolian Banks (MNT million) \n        Total Problem   \nTotal \n  Total Loan    Nonperforming  Loans (NPL +  NPL \nProblem \nAs of  Outstanding  Past Due  Loans  Past Due)  Ratio \nLoans Ratio \nDec 2007  2,056,060.80  40,320.00  68,071.30  108,391.30  3.31%  5.27% \nJun 2008  2,559,433.00  54,623.50  73,058.40  127,681.90  2.85%  4.99% \nDec 2008  2,635,551.60  93,323.10  188,667.20  281,990.30  7.16%  10.70% \nJun 2009  2,558,929.70  152,115.40  297,964.50  450,079.90  11.64%  17.59% \nJul 2009  2,580,778.50  143,381.40  352,907.90  496,289.30  13.67%  19.23% \nNPL = nonperforming loan. \nSource: Monthly Bulletin, Bank of Mongolia, August 2009. \n \n3.  Several small- and medium-sized banks are also suffering from weak internal controls \nand poor corporate governance. Off-balance sheet transactions and contingent liabilities may \npose additional threats and several Mongolian banks have persistent problems with fraudulent \nletters of credit. Of the 15 commercial banks, 3 are large, 7 are medium-sized, and 5 are small. \nAll banks are privately owned and autonomous, with no government involvement in policy-\nmaking, management, and operations. \n \n4.  Fiscal Impact. The Government\u2019s actions thus far reflect ad-hoc emergency efforts, \nsuch as the establishment of the blanket deposit guarantee and emergency liquidity injections \ninto commercial banks by the Bank of Mongolia (BOM), the central bank. The blanket deposit \nguarantee exposes the Government to considerable fiscal risk, as high as 70% of GDP. A \nrecent  stress  test  conducted  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  indicates  that \nrecapitalization needs to bring capital adequacy ratios above the BOM norm; the cost of this \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 September 2009. \n2  A systemic banking crisis means that the (threatened) insolvency of so many banks in a country is such that the \ncountry's entire banking system, or an important part of the banking system, is threatened with collapse.  \n3  The quality of loans to construction, mining, and agriculture and livestock sectors has suffered the most. \n \n ", "2  \ncould reach 10% of GDP. One recapitalization option being considered is the issuance of \ngovernment restructuring bonds.4  \n \n5.  Need for Swift Action. The Ministry of Finance and BOM have yet to decide on a \ncomprehensive and consistent strategy and plan of actions to resolve the banking crisis. The \nabove-mentioned ad-hoc measures may ease immediate pressure on banks and borrowers, but \nmay  expose  the  Government  to  higher  fiscal  impact  and  provide  disincentives  that  may \nundermine market discipline and the sustainability of the banking system. The Government \nindicates that it would like to (i) act swiftly; (ii) minimize public financial support; (iii) reinvigorate \nthe banking sector for it to lend again, especially to vulnerable industries; (iv) seek funding from \ninternational  financial  institutions  to  meet  the  recapitalization  needs  of  banks;  and  \n(v)  attract  foreign  investors.  A  well  thought-out  and  swiftly  implemented  approach  is  a \npreemptive measure to address the banking crisis, in contrast to an ad-hoc approach that \nfocuses on individual failed banks. Eventually, the ad-hoc approach is likely to incur higher fiscal \ncosts while risking a bank run and collapse of the banking sector. \n \n6.  Nonperforming Loan Resolution. The proper disposal and management of impaired \nassets is one of the most critical and complex tasks in managing banking crises. International \nexperiences from previous banking crises have shown mixed results for various approaches to \nNPL resolution and systemic risk management for banking. What has worked well in one \ncountry in a particular situation may not necessarily work in another. Nonetheless, ensuring that \na coherent legal and regulatory environment and the market infrastructure necessary for the \nchosen NPL resolution approach are in place is important. \n \n7.  BOM  and  the  Government  should  consider  a  number  of  available  approaches  for \ndifferent phases of a banking crisis.5 When the amount of impaired assets reaches systemic \nproportions, i.e., the majority of banks are technically insolvent, in-house collection to resolve \nNPLs becomes less effective as it requires more financial and human resources and thus forces \ncommercial banks to move away from normal banking business. On the other hand, a \"good \nbank\" and \"bad bank\" approach would generally be considered appropriate during a banking \ncrisis, where the \"bad bank\" can be an asset management company (AMC).  \n \n8.  A multifaceted approach may be required to resolve NPLs in Mongolia, such as a \ncombination  of  in-house  collection  and  AMC;  and  quick-disposal  and  long-term  corporate \nrestructuring. However, regardless of the approach used, creditor rights and insolvency systems \nmust be strengthened and formal restructuring and rehabilitation mechanisms improved.  \n \n9.  An AMC generally has more flexibility in using different NPL resolution techniques, has \nmore leverage over non-paying borrowers from consolidating their debts from different banks, \nand  can  serve  as  a  vehicle  for  the  orderly  restructuring  of  certain  economic  sectors. \nNonetheless, the success of AMCs in developing countries has been hindered by a number of \nfactors such as a large portion of nonperforming policy loans, the presence of political influence, \nand the lack of appropriate funding and professional management. Studies indicate that for \nAMCs to be successful, they need to have assets that are easily liquidated, operate without \npolitical interference, have no loans to state-owned enterprises, and operate in a well-developed \nlegal and institutional environment.   \n                                                 \n4  IMF earlier endorsed the blanket deposit guarantee and indicated that the principal of restructuring bonds will not \nbe counted as part of the current government budget deficit and thus be excluded from the IMF Standby \nAgreement. The interest payments will be included in the budget deficit calculation. \n5  Measures during the containment phase could include deposit freeze, bank holiday, blanket guarantee, liquidity \nsupport, and emergency lending. Measures during the resolution phase could include forbearance, large-scale \ngovernment intervention, bank closure, nationalization, mergers, sales to foreigners, banking restructuring agency, \nasset management company, recapitalization, deposit insurance, and haircuts (including on depositors). \n ", "  3\n \n10.    The new AMC in Mongolia, if needed, must be a separate legal and independent entity \ninsulated from political influence, with the Government not being involved in its day-to-day \noperations  and  management  decisions.  It  needs  to  be  managed  professionally  and  have \nsignificant expertise in asset management and NPL resolution. The success of the AMC will \ndepend upon its having strong leadership, proper governance structures and internal controls, \noperating independence, and appropriately structured incentives to its employees to maximize \nrecovery rates resulting from the disposition of the impaired assets.  \n \n11.  Capacity Building. Due to the limited human resources available in Mongolia, capacity-\nbuilding initiatives in NPL resolution and corporate governance should be provided to the AMC \nmanagement and staff, the AMC supervisory and regulatory agencies, the commercial banks, \nand selected specialists from the legal and judicial system. Operating support for the AMC \nshould  be  provided  through  the  engagement  of  long-term  advisory  and/or  management \nconsultants. In addition, judges should be trained on new issues pertaining to such areas as \nreceivership, bankruptcy, corporate and banking law, and NPL resolution.  \n \n12.  Legal and Regulatory Framework. Effective systemic risk management of the banking \nsystem requires a supportive legal and regulatory framework. The Central Bank Law and the \nBanking Law do not provide enough legal support for BOM in some areas, such as consolidated \nsupervision and supervision for connected party lending; they also do not provide sufficient legal \nprotection for BOM supervisors. Moreover, the lack of an effective framework for nonjudicial \nforeclosure is a key impediment to the rapid resolution of NPLs. Special legislation will also be \nneeded for speedy bankruptcy processes, and NPL transfer and recovery. \n \n13.  Corporate Governance and Internal Controls. Weak corporate governance structures \nand internal controls plague the Mongolian banking system; capacity to address operations \nissues is often insufficient. Significant risks are inadequately identified, measured, monitored, or \ncontrolled. Fraudulent letters of credit, excessive concentration of lending to connected parties, \nthe  rescheduling  of  NPLs  to  avoid  proper  classification  and  provisioning,  and  outright \nmalfeasance have all contributed to the weak condition of many commercial banks.  \n \n14.  ADB has provided considerable support to the transformation of Mongolia\u2019s finance \nsector since 1991.6 This support will continue in the form of TA on NPL resolution; strengthening \nof  BOM  capacity;  and  later,  strengthening  of  a  deposit  insurance  system.  It  is  part  of  a \ncoordinated development partner effort to help BOM and the Government better manage the \nbanking crisis. Under this effort, the International Finance Corporation and European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development will focus on assisting their client banks. The United States \nAgency for International Development will be dealing with case-by-case workouts of troubled \nbanks and on training bank staff in credit underwriting. ADB, IMF and the World Bank will jointly \nwork on policy actions for systemic risk management and restructuring of the banking sector. \nIMF is conducting a first estimate (ahead of the diagnostic portfolio audits) of the potential fiscal \ncost of restructuring the banking sector, and the World Bank will conduct portfolio audits for \nmost commercial banks. The United States Treasury is planning to field a long-term advisor to \nBOM on problem bank resolution. The Japan International Cooperation Agency is supporting \nBOM's Banking Supervision Department by preparing an inspection manual and evaluation \nmodel for corporate governance, and a manual for information technology inspections. \n \n \n                                                 \n6  The   2008   Country  Assistance  Program Evaluation (CAPE) rated ADB's  support  to  the  financial  sector  as \nsuccessful and relevant. \n ", "4  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The expected impact of the TA is a stronger and broader-based economic recovery \nsupported  by  a  healthy  banking  sector.  The  expected  outcome  is  the  establishment  of  a \nconducive  and  prudent  policy  and  operating  framework  for  systemic  risk  management  of \nbanking sector and distressed assets resolution.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA will deliver four major outputs: \n \n(i)  Reinforce BOM and Government leadership, authority, and capacity in systemic \nrisk management of banking sector by (a) developing an NPL resolution action \nplan;  (b)  reviewing  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  banking  sector \nsystemic  risk  management  and  NPL  resolution  and  supervision,  and  by \nsuggesting amendments; and (c) developing special legislation, if needed, for the \nimplementation of the chosen NPL resolution approach, as well as supporting \naction  and  assistance  in  meeting  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  for \nimplementing this approach. \n(ii)  Strengthen the corporate governance and internal controls of commercial banks \nby (a) developing guidelines for corporate governance reforms and improvements \nin risk management, and internal controls for commercial banks; (b) ensuring that \nstricter  standards  of  corporate  governance,  risk  management,  and  internal \ncontrols are enforced as an integral part of NPL resolution and commercial bank \nrecapitalization;  and  (c)  raising  public  awareness  of  the  need  for  corporate \ngovernance  in  the  commercial  banking  sector  by  supporting  the  Corporate \nGovernance Development Center at the Institute of Finance and Economics, \nwhich is indirectly associated with the Government. \n(iii)  Support a multifaceted approach for NPL resolution by (a) examining various \napproaches  to  NPL  resolution  and  recommending  a  best  combination;  (b) \npreparing implementation strategies using the best combination of approaches; (c) \nproviding advice on all NPL resolution-related techniques and operations; and (d) \nproviding  training  and  capacity  building  initiatives  in  essential  skills  for  NPL \nmanagement and resolution.7 \n(iv)  Provide  knowledge  products  in  the  forms  of  policy  and  technical  notes  and \nworkshops targeting senior policy and decision makers.8 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $2,300,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $2,000,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government and BOM, the \nExecuting Agency, will provide in-kind contributions worth $300,000. Detailed cost estimates \nand the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n \n                                                 \n7  Training activities include workshops and seminars, as well as on-the-job training by international consultants. \n8  Knowledge products can cover a range of topics such as a systemic risk management strategy for the banking \nsector, NPL resolution techniques, and corporate governance mechanisms. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  BOM, as the Executing Agency, will have overall responsibility for ensuring coordination \nwith  other  government  agencies,  timely  project  implementation,  and  reporting  to  ADB  on \nprogress made, problems encountered, and remedial actions taken during implementation. The \nAMC, if established, would be the Implementing Agency.  \n \n19.  The TA will require the services of international consultants (up to 44 person-months) \nand national consultants (up to 88 person-months). Expertise in the following areas of work will \nbe accessed: systemic risk management of the banking sector, legal and regulatory reform, \ncorporate governance and internal control, distressed assets resolution, and NPL management. \nThe outline terms of reference for the consulting services in those areas and the detailed \nbreakdown of consultant allocations in each area are in Appendix 3. ADB will select and engage \nthe consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time).  \n \n20.  The TA will use a mix of individual consultants and consulting firms, with more complex \nassignments being given to consulting firms to facilitate coordination of the inputs of the various \nexperts. For an estimated budget of $800,000, three international consultants will be engaged \non an individual basis9 for a total of 25 person-months and three national consultants for a total \nof 65 person-months. In the case of a firm, the preferred selection method for consultants is \nquality and cost-based selection with a quality-cost ratio of 80:20. The proceeds of the TA will \nbe  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook.10 For  the \nprocurement of equipment and the conduct of training seminars and conferences, an advance \npayment facility could be used.11 \n \n21.  The TA is expected to begin in November 2009 and end in December 2012. The last  \n3 months of this period are allocated for contract completion.  \n \n22.  Individual consultants or consulting firms, once engaged, will submit the following to \nADB and BOM: (i) an inception report 2 weeks after the commencement of their services, \n(ii) interim progress reports at appropriate stages during TA implementation, (iii) a draft final \nreport before the conclusion of the contract, and (iv) a final report 2 weeks after receiving \ncomments  from  ADB  and  BOM.  All  reports  will  be  submitted  in  English  and  Mongolian. \nWorkshops will be organized periodically to disseminate the consultants\u2019 findings and to discuss \npolicy recommendations. Major project activities will be regularly monitored and reported on by \nthe BOM and ADB administration missions. Consultants\u2019 reports will be presented at workshops \nand seminars organized for the validation of findings. Selected reports will be made available on \nADB websites in English and Mongolian, if appropriate, and published whenever warranted.  \n   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n23.     The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $2,000,000  on  a  grant  basis  to  Mongolia  for  Policy  and \nInstitutional Support for Banking Sector Systemic Risk Management. \n                                                 \n9  These include international NPL resolution specialist (3 person-months), international banking legal and regulatory \nspecialist  (5  person-months),  international  asset  management  specialist  (17  person-months),  national  NPL \nresolution specialist (6 person-months), national banking legal and regulatory specialist (8 person-months), and \nnational asset management specialist (26 person-months). \n10  ADB. 2008.
