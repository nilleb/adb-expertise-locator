Social services have recently been devolved to district and local governments under a \nradically new governance system. With heavy demand for additional social services within the \ndevolved delivery system, the challenge facing local governments is to provide quality basic   \nhealth,  education,  and  safe  water  and  sanitation.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  (the \nGovernment) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance \n(TA) to prepare a feasibility study to improve social services in Punjab, with special emphasis on \ncapacity building. The TA mission visited Pakistan from 24\u201331 May 2003 to prepare the TA \nrationale, design, costing, implementation plan and outline terms of reference for experts for the \nproposed Punjab Devolved Social Services Sector Development Program, for 2004.1 The TA \nbuilds on lessons from previous and ongoing sector investments that supported the social \nsectors throughout much of the 1990s.2 It supports devolution, which has recently resulted in the \ntransfer of responsibility for social service delivery to the districts, follows closely the design of \nthe devolved social services (DSS) being prepared for Sindh Province, and supports resource \nmanagement efforts that help to place devolution on a firm financial footing.3 An initial poverty \nand social analysis was carried out (Appendix 1). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Context.  The  socioeconomic  conditions  in  Punjab  remain  poor  especially  in  rural \ncommunities. Despite Government and external efforts to keep abreast of population growth, \nstill only about two-third of all people have access to clean drinking water, 80% of school age \nchildren attend elementary school, and 35% of rural children 12\u201323 months are immunized \n(51% overall).  About one third of Punjab\u2019s people live in poverty, on less than a dollar a day. \nThey face harsh conditions including water shortages, unemployment, political turmoil, security \nproblems, and a feudal land tenure system in some areas.  Women not only lack assets and \nopportunities, but depend on their husbands\u2019 family, have no social safety net, and are bound by \ntraditions and practices that affect welfare and sometimes make it difficult for them to attend \nschools and clinics. However, education and employment of females are increasing. Another \npositive trend is the increasing capacity of communities to organize themselves and operate \nschools and water schemes under devolution. DSS at the district level and below are expected \nto increase community participation and accountability and sustainability of basic social services \nin the future.  Punjab already has an extensive network of schools and health care facilities, \nwhich when properly managed and functioning will provide major public benefits to the poor. \nStill, health and education administration and planning at the local level require extensive and \ncontinuing capacity building. With ongoing ADB-assistance, the Government of Punjab has set \nambitious targets that are in line with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the \npoverty reduction strategy and that spell out the sector targets in education, health, and safe \nwater. 4 \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) in April 2003. \n2 ADB. 1996.

In education, major factors affecting enrolment are poverty-related cost and opportunity \ncost, inadequate facilities and poor quality of education resulting in high dropout rates, and staff \nabsenteeism in schools. While quality is a factor in high dropout rates, additional funds are still \nrequired to increase enrollment in elementary schooling and improve secondary schools to \nensure that all students\u2014especially girls\u2014have wider choices in fulfilling life opportunities. A \nmajor development is the increasing community involvement in operating schools and the hiring \nof contract teachers who are limited from transferring out of the district. To achieve higher \nschool enrollment in line with the education sector reform program, Punjab will support classes \n9\u201312  including  science  education,  to  increase  enrollments  through  improved  teaching  and \nlearning. The World Bank will provide assistance to classes 1\u20138. Interventions will be tied to \nongoing projects. Special efforts are needed to rationalize facilities and staffing in each district \nto maximize the internal efficiency of the education system. \n \n4.  In health, the focus has shifted from expanding primary health care to rationalizing and \nreforming district health services. Punjab wants to reestablish a system approach based on the \nprinciples of primary health care and integrated priority programs, including for nutrition and \nfamily planning. The Government has planned reform initiatives at tertiary, secondary, and \nprimary levels with strong emphasis on medical institutions and teaching hospitals. Districts \nsupport the provincial emphasis on developing an integrated health delivery system that links \nbasic health units, rural health centers, and subdistricts, and district headquarters, including the \nstrengthening of existing facilities. The province wants to strengthen its role in policy, guidance, \nquality control, monitoring, and training of district health staff.  \n  \n5.  In water supply and sanitation, the focus is on increasing coverage, capacity building of \nsubdistrict  management  associations  and  community  ownership  of  small-scale  water  and \nsanitation schemes. The water supply and sanitation sector is facing mounting problems in \nexpanding coverage to the entire population. The problems include groundwater availability and \nhigh  operating  costs.  Devolution,  together  with  a  much  better  fiscal  position,  has  created \nopportunities  for  social  sector  development  and  reform  whereby  subdistrict  management \nassociations  can  begin  to  take  responsibility  for  planning  and  implementing  small-scale \nschemes to achieve wider access to clean water and sanitation. Learning from ongoing projects \nin water and sanitation, the Government is keen to improve governance of public social services \nand work with the private sector, nongovernment organizations, and communities toward the \nMDG targets in water and sanitation. \n \n6.  Services in education, health, and water supply are failing the people in Punjab because \nthe public is unable to monitor the accountability of service providers. The decision by the \nGovernment of Punjab and ADB to support DSS could substantially improve the breadth and \ndepth of social service delivery throughout Punjab. Ongoing devolution will be supported as \nDSS helps to strengthen local government\u2019s ability to plan and manage basic services in social \nsectors that only it can provide; add to the district funding flow to ensure for social services \ngreater spending that might otherwise be reallocated to infrastructure projects; help mobilize \nadditional financing under the resource management program loan; and strengthen linkages \nthat allow provincial line departments to better focus on policy, planning, and administrative \ntraining for local bodies charged with day-to-day operations. \n \n7.  Special Issues. Macro-level issues facing the social sectors include finding ways for \nlocal governments to (i) streamline political and administrative forces to benefit the public; (ii) \nincrease linkages between local and provincial governments to manage social sector policy \nreforms, technical support, and monitoring; and (iii) determine absorptive capacity and financing \nmechanisms  to  ensure  the  efficiency  of  additional  resources  and  accountability  by \nexperimenting with incentives to mobilize community support. Micro-level issues facing social ", "  3\nservice delivery include (i) developing public-private partnerships to help finance and manage \nsocial services; (ii) building capacity for districts to plan, budget, and deliver improved social \nservices on an equitable basis to rural areas; and (iii) prioritizing programs that help to achieve \nthe MDGs. Many social sector policy issues are being addressed at the provincial level under \nongoing ADB program loans while TAs broaden policy issues related to local government and \nneeded to support social service delivery at the district and community levels.  \n \n8.  Government Policy Dialogue. The Federal Government released its Interim Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)5 in January 2002 along with its Education Sector Reform \nProgram. Both support the MDGs and \u201ceducation fast-track initiative\u201d strategy. Similar strategies \nexist  for  health  through  the  National  Health  Program,  2001.  Likewise,  the  Government  is \npreparing its national water strategy in 2003. The national policies supporting international goals \nfound in the PRSP, National Health Policy, and Education Sector Report have provided needed \ndiscussion and planning between provincial governments and external funding agencies, to \nfinance social sector development in Pakistan over the medium term. In 2003, the Punjab PRSP \nis being prepared in part through support from ADB and will indicate provincial and district \ntargets for poverty reduction strategies to support MDGs in the districts. The district targets can \nbe monitored along with the use of external resources provided to meet these goals. Devolution \nof  service  delivery  from  provinces  to  districts  and  below  took  place  in  2001\u20132002  and  is \ncurrently being implemented throughout Pakistan. In Punjab, innovative programs are being \npiloted in health and education to improve management of social services. In one district, mobile \nhealth  teams  visit  scattered  rural  health  centers;  in  other  districts  school  management \ncommittees  are  being  trained  to  be  more  inclusive.  These  Government  programs  will  be \nevaluated over time to determine the feasibility of their wide-scale introduction.  \n \n9.  External Financing. ADB is supporting the social sectors in Punjab through projects in \neducation (primary girls\u2019 school, science education, and technical education); health, (women\u2019s \nhealth and reproductive health); and water and sanitation (the Punjab Community Water Supply \nand Sanitation Project).6 The federal Decentralized Sector Program and Access to Justice and \nthe proposed Punjab resource management program are intended to support devolution and its \nadjustment costs through macro-level financial support. The ADB country strategy, PRSP, and \npoverty, gender, and governance strategies all stress Government  efforts to improve local \nservice delivery. ADB has provided TA to develop the PRSP in Punjab. Other agencies working \nin  the  social  sector  include  the  Department  for  International  Development,  United  Nations \nagencies and World Bank support for vertical programs in health. The World Bank is preparing a \nprovincial adjustment credit for the education sector in 2003, to help meet MDG targets in \nelementary education. \n \n10.  Lessons Learned. The major lesson learned by the Government and external agencies \nconfirms that support for the social sectors is labor intensive and must be continuing. Under \ndevolution, the aim is for local governments to take responsibility for social services by building \nlinks between districts and community citizen\u2019s boards. Over time, the boards will become \ncapable  of  taking  responsibility  for  service  delivery  rather  than  relying  exclusively  on  the \nprovincial government to administer programs.  Social service delivery must be seen as a \ncooperative venture between all levels of Government and stakeholders who must support \nquality low cost services. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5  Government of Pakistan. 2002.

The objective of the TA is to prepare a sector development program (SDP) to make DSS \nmore efficient, equitable, and sustainable so that major impacts result for the poor in health, \neducation, and water supply and sanitation. Consequently, the TA will strengthen devolution \nduring its early stages because social service delivery at the local level is the best way to \nachieve results that impact people. A local government ordinance (2001) already devolves \nauthority and funding to districts while ongoing and proposed ADB SDP support will provide \nfinancial sustainability to the province and districts.  Outputs will be divided into policy and \nactivities. First, TA consultants will discuss with stakeholders and recommend social sector \npolicies that support local government capacity to improve efficiency in the delivery of social \nservices. These include human resources management, horizontal coordination, and community \nparticipation  for  accountability\u2015all  are  needed  for  effective  delivery  of  services.  Second, \nconsultants  will  design  DSS  activities  to help  local  governments  (i)  improve  the  quality  of \nexpanded  social  services;  (ii)  build  local  capacity  for  DSS  delivery;  and  (iii)  support \nimprovements to make the social sector more efficient, equitable, and sustainable. Sector-\nspecific priorities will mirror MDGs and extend universal basic education, reduce dropout rates, \nimprove gender balance, reduce maternal and child mortality, reduce fertility, and increase \naccess to safe drinking water supply and sanitation. Broadening the social platform, community \nparticipation, capacity building, and reforms will strengthen social services.  \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  Punjab wants a program that targets the poor and is province-wide and sector-wide, \ndemand-driven, and performance-based. The TA will help to develop a selection of policies and \nreforms to supplement funds and offer technical support to improve and expand social services \nbased on local needs. All 34 districts in Punjab will be assisted for 3\u20135 years, with a focus on \nrelatively low cost services that are easy to administer and will benefit many people, with \nemphasis on the poor. Support will be provided for health, education, and water supply and \nsanitation, with crosscutting support for related services such as poverty reduction, community \nparticipation,  and  gender  in  development.  The  economics  and  finance,  and  governance \nconsultants will develop a policy matrix to guarantee district-level capacity to deliver social \nservices. The gender and social participation and sector specialists will develop a selection of \nactivities to reinforce capacity building to strengthen social service delivery. For example, (i) in \neducation, support may involve almost any additional funds to strengthen school enrolment; (ii) \nin health and population welfare, support may include improvements in the supply of essential \ndrugs;  contracting  of  nurses  and  lady  health  visitors  to  improve  maternal  services;  and \nupgrading facilities based on need; and (iii) in water supply and sanitation, support may include \ndeveloping master plans and contracting arrangements for improving public water supply and \nsanitation. Activities are intended to improve run-down facilities and support new initiatives \nincluding public-private partnerships. ADB financing for the proposed SDP may follow one of \nseveral design modalities and the consultants will review ongoing ADB, Government, and other \nexternally funded programs and projects to avoid overlap and indicate how the proposed DSS \nwill complement ongoing efforts. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance $300,000 \ncovering the entire foreign exchange cost of $205,000 and $95,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will \nfinance  consulting  services,  production  of  reports,  workshops,  office  equipment,  and ", "  5\nadministration support services. The provincial government contribution of $100,000 equivalent \nin kind will cover support for staff, use of facilities across sectors throughout the province, \ncommunications,  and  transport  as  indicated  in  the  financing  plan  in  Appendix  2.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any \nensuing program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The Planning and Development Department, Punjab, will be the Executing Agency for \nthe TA.  A steering committee will be established to provide overall guidance to the TA team. \nThe committee, chaired by the chairman of the Planning and Development Department, will \ncomprise representatives from the departments of education, local government, health and \nurban  services,  public  health  engineering,  and  finance;  four  representatives  from  district \ngovernment; and nongovernment representatives. The committee will monitor the TA over 5 \nmonths to ensure Government ownership for the proposed design and to ensure that the \nfeasibility study serves pro-poor economic growth. The TA will include an office in the Health \nDepartment, as the lead line department to accommodate the experts in Lahore and on field \nvisits. The departments of health, education, and local governments will provide counterpart \nstaff to assist the team. \n \n15.  The TA will use the services of one international (5 person-months) and five domestic \nspecialists  (18  person-months).  The  international  expert  will  be  an  economic  and  finance \nspecialist and the team leader. The five domestic specialists will include water supply and \nsanitation (4 person-months); gender and social participation (3 person-months); education \n(3 person-months); health (3 person-months); and governance (5 person-months). ADB will \nengage individual specialists in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Local \nconsultants may be engaged individually or through local firms. Outline terms of reference are \nfound in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The TA will start in October 2003 and be completed by 31 March 2004. The consulting \nteam will prepare an inception report after 1 month, a preliminary report after 3.5 months and \nthe draft final report in the fourth month. The TA will be conducted through field visits employing \nparticipatory methods to ensure consultation with a wide range of stakeholders such as patients, \ndoctors, parents, teachers, and community water boards. The consultants will organize four \nregional and one provincial workshop in Lahore to solicit advice and recommendations from \nstakeholders for use in the feasibility study. If required, additional workshops may be held. The \nstudy will include a selection of activities determined by district offices to upgrade existing \nfacilities, and new activities including joint public-private partnerships. The team will prepare \ntraining programs for capacity building in each sector to ensure sustainable implementation at \nall levels of Government service delivery. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis, to \nthe  Government  of  Pakistan  for  preparing  the  Punjab  Devolved  Social  Services  Sector \nDevelopment Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

However, \nPakistan\u2019s social indicators compare unfavorably with those of other countries with similar levels of per capita income.  \nPeople in Pakistan suffer from low school enrollment, poor health, and poor access to clear water. In 1993, Pakistan \nlaunched the Social Action Program (SAP), with broad-based external support to address poor social indicators. The \nGovernment has made efforts to bring the poverty alleviation to a primary focus in the formulation of economic policy. \nIn Pakistan, social sector development requires radical change in the social service management and delivery system.  \nIn August 2001, the Government of Pakistan devolved social services to local governments throughout the provinces. \nPunjab Province contains half of the population of the country and is struggling to improve social service delivery, \nespecially to the poorest communities.  \n \nPunjab has over 82 million people, 15 million of them living in the three major cities and the rest scattered in small \ntowns, trading posts, villages, and hamlets.  About one third of Punjab\u2019s people live in poverty, on less than a dollar a \nday. The social status of the people of Punjab, notably those living in urban slums and rural areas is poor. Many \nhouseholds cannot afford energy charges. Public and personal hygiene are poor. About one third of children are \nmalnourished. The literacy rate among the population of 10 years and above is 47%. The people in Punjab face \nhardship in environmental conditions including water shortage, unemployment, political turmoil, and feudal land tenure \nsystem. \n \nThe decentralization of social services being implemented at the district level and below is expected to increase \ncommunity participation and accountability and sustainability of basic services to communities in the future.  Punjab \nalready has an extensive network of schools and clinics. The people will gain major benefits if the system is developed \nfor proper functioning of these services. \nB.
