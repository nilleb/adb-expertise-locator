The support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the Pacific at the regional level is \nguided by the Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014,1 which takes direction from ADB\u2019s Strategy 20202 \nand  the  Pacific  Island  Forum\u2019s  Pacific  Plan.3 The  Pacific  Approach  therefore  presents  an \nagenda aimed at fostering connectivity, consensus, and a greater sense of Pacific community \nthrough (i) inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth, (ii) good governance, and (iii) \nregional cooperation and integration. The proposed technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the \ncapacity  of  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  to  manage  for  inclusive  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  economic growth, specifically  assisting  them  in  improving  their \neconomic  monitoring  and  analysis  capacity  to  better  inform  policymaking  and  economic \ngovernance.4 This will be achieved through assistance to economists and other policy advisors \nin the Pacific who are responsible for economic management and policy formulation and public \nfinancial management (PFM). \n \n2.  The  regional  capacity  development  TA  continues  efforts  begun  under  the    Pacific \nEconomic Management TA (phase 1)5, which responded to challenges that Pacific countries \nfaced  in  their  efforts  to  improve  economic  monitoring  as  well  as  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of policy in response to the global financial and economic crisis. Building upon \nthis successful earlier effort, the phase 2 TA will continue to assist Pacific DMCs in building their \neconomic analytical capacity, including the provision of timely economic monitoring based on an \nenhanced set of economic indicators and development of economic planning and forecasting \nmodels. The design of the phase 2 TA was developed over the course of implementation of the  \nphase 1 TA. Consultations with economic policymakers and technical staff from the central \nbanks and finance ministries of several Pacific DMCs guided refinements to the TA design.6 The \ndesign and monitoring framework of the phase 2 TA is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB\u2019s 14 DMCs in the Pacific are either fragile states or exhibit strong characteristics of \nfragility. Weak economic policies contribute to this fragility, which are linked to shortcomings in \npolicy and institutional environments as highlighted by ADB\u2019s country performance assessments \nand ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach (footnote 1). For these DMCs, ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 posits, \u201cdue to \ngenerally  weak  policy  regimes,  their  often  small  size,  economic  vulnerability,  and  weak \ninstitutions. ADB must seek innovative means to strengthen the effectiveness of country-led \nmodels of engagement\u201d (footnote 2). \n \n4.  Long-term growth rates are low in most Pacific DMCs, and for most of the region's \npopulation, the long-term process of structural transformation is either absent or has stalled. \nPoor growth outcomes can be traced back to the small size and relatively remote locations of \nthese economies, and the history of large inefficient public sectors and policy and institutional \nconstraints to private sector development. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009.

The TA first appeared in the \nbusiness opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 December 2013.  \n5  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Pacific Economic Management. Manila.  \n6  These Pacific DMCs included the Cook Islands, Fiji, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of \nMicronesia, Nauru, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu. \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Key constraints lie in the institutional settings. Despite repeated efforts at structural \nadjustment, supported by externally funded policy analyses and advice, many Pacific DMCs \ncontinue to struggle in implementing policies that support higher growth and in meeting their \npublic commitments to improved economic management.7 The results from these efforts have \nremained below expectations. \n \n6.  Improving the flow of economic information through improvements in the timeliness, \nprecision, and coverage of economic indicators is needed to enable governments to make \ninformed policy decisions. Various high-level officials from economic agencies of the Pacific \nDMCs (e.g., secretaries or ministers of finance or central bank governors of Cook Islands, \nRepublic of Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Solomon Islands, and Tonga) \nhave  advised  ADB  that  they  would  welcome  help  to  strengthen  their  economic  analyses. \nSustained effort is needed to build capacity for technical assessment of economic policy as a \ntrigger for constructive policy and institutional change in Pacific DMCs. Improvements in PFM \nare  also  essential  if  Pacific  governments  are  to  take  advantage  of  improved  economic \nmonitoring and modeling. Change depends on long-term relationships between these DMCs \nand their development partners, as well as among advisors, reformers, and those impacted by \nreforms. Above all, assistance to improve economic management needs to be tailored to meet \nindividual circumstances and develop local capacity, ownership, and control.  \n \n7.  Pacific  economies  have  garnered  significant  economic  benefits  from  policy  and \ninstitutional reform and improved economic modeling. For example, successful reforms in the \naviation8 and mobile telecommunication9 sectors have allowed for new and lower-cost entrants, \nspurred growth, and benefitted users. Development of simple fiscal management models and \nassociated capacity building of budget and economic staff in selected Pacific DMCs (e.g., Cook \nIslands, Fiji, Republic of Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Solomon Islands, \nTonga, Tuvalu) have improved the ability of policy makers to make assessments of long-run \nimplications  of  budget  decisions.  These  successes  have  been  characterized  by  national \ncommitments to locally driven efforts based on consultative and participatory processes. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the long-term impact of improved economic performance and \nPFM  in  participating  Pacific  DMCs.10 The  expectation  is  that  economic  policies  would  be \nadjusted to spur inclusive growth and adapt to new opportunities and changing conditions in the \nglobal  economy.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  established  through  the  demonstration  of \nimproved  economic  performance  as  measured  by  higher  average  levels  of  national  gross \ndomestic product growth, and through strengthened PFM measured by national improvements \nin public expenditure and financial assessment review scores in participating Pacific DMCs.  \n \n9.  The outcome will be improved economic policies and PFM implemented in participating \nPacific DMCs. This will be measured by the existence of effective coalitions for change of key \n                                                \n7  Complex reform areas include access to land, improvements in the foreign investment environment, and private \nparticipation in public assets and services. \n8  Aviation reforms have been implemented in Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga. \n9  Mobile telecommunication reforms have been undertaken in Fiji, Samoa, and Vanuatu. \n10  Pacific DMCs will participate on a self-selecting basis, with assistance provided in response to demand and \nexpressed commitment. Given limited TA resources, allocation will also reflect principles of equity and efficiency.   \n ", "  3\nstakeholders active in at least three Pacific DMCs. These coalitions will engage in economic \npolicy dialogue in support of effective implementation of economic policy reforms. A further \nindicator of success will be the publication of timely and accurate reports on budget execution \nby at least six Pacific DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The planned outputs of the TA are (i) an improved set of economic indicators, produced \nand shared on a timely basis; (ii) economic and PFM policy advice; and (iii) new or enhanced \neconomic or financial models for Pacific DMCs. \n \n11.  This  combination  of  support  will  focus  on  (i)  ensuring  central  banks  and  finance \nministries have access to high-quality economic monitoring and analysis\u2014including modeling \nand forecasting tools\u2014as well as to high-level policy advice, and (ii) promoting the incorporation \nof this monitoring, analysis, and policy advice into government decision making and public \npolicy dialogue. The TA also seeks to enhance networking and knowledge sharing among \neconomists working in or specializing in the Pacific economies, as well as among governments \nin the region. This form of south\u2013south cooperation proved effective in phase 1 in sharing \nsuccess experiences and practices between Pacific DMCs where the operational context is \nsimilar. The design of TA reflects lessons learned from phase 1, including the importance of \nready access to advice when needed and the value to be gained from networking.11 \n \n12.  The phase 2 TA will provide highly experienced lead advisors and PFM specialists who \nwill guide decision makers and senior economic advisors in Pacific DMCs. These mentors will \ninclude  qualified  persons  from  Pacific  countries  to  ensure  adequate  experience  and \nunderstanding of the Pacific economies and their political economies and to enhance regional \nownership of the policy advice provided. \n \n13.  Advisors and economic analysts will provide technical support to the lead advisors and \nPFM specialists as needed. They may also be called upon to engage with technical-level \npersonnel in Pacific DMC economic agencies, providing opportunities for on-the-job learning \nand maximizing the sustainability of the TA project\u2019s outputs by transferring knowledge and \ngenerating support for economic policy reforms at other levels of government.  \n \n14.  The Pacific Economic Monitor, a biannual publication of ADB, will provide a regular \nforum for broad dissemination of good practices and lessons. Regular media activities will \ninclude  press  releases,  media  interviews  by  ADB  staff  upon  publication  of  each  Pacific \nEconomic Monitor issue, and contributions to economic policy blogs prepared by the TA project \nteam. TA outputs may also be presented at regional conferences and workshops on economic \nissues in the Pacific region, and at periodic workshops organized by the TA that involve officials \nfrom selected Pacific DMCs. \n \n15.  As  in  phase  1,  country-level  assistance  will  remain  demand-driven,  i.e.,  it  will  be \nprovided in response to requests from Pacific DMCs related to (i) the core subject areas of the \nTA and (ii) existing activities, both self and development partner funded. Support will continue to \nfocus on the finance and treasury portfolios and central banks in Pacific DMCs, and it will be \nundertaken in close cooperation with ADB's country operations and other development partner \nactivities. \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n ", "4 \n \n16.  The TA will support country- and regional-level dialogue. This would enable government \ndecision  makers,  the  private  sector,  civil  society,  and  other  stakeholders  in  economic \nmanagement to share their experiences and debate policy issues, many of which are likely to be \ncommon across the region. Where possible, support for regional dialogue will be joined to other \nregional  events.  The  TA  will  also  build  on  efforts  to  prepare  macroeconomic  and  fiscal \nforecasting frameworks under phase 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others [$500,000] and TASF-V [$250,000]). \nThe  cost  estimates  and financing  plan  are  presented  in  Appendix  2. It  is  anticipated that \nsuccessful early implementation of the TA will enable the processing of additional financing in \nsupport of TA objectives to carry activities beyond the initial 12 months.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will be the executing agency as well as the implementing \nagency  for  the  TA.  Funds  for  regional  conferences,  seminars,  and  training  events  will  be \nadministered by the Pacific Department. Implementation will be harmonized with ADB\u2019s other \nactivities in the Pacific through close coordination with concerned country directors, country \nteam  leaders,  and  the  activities  of  other  development  partners,  principally  through  the \nmaintenance of close relationships with development partners working in related fields.  \n \n19.  International and national consultants will be engaged on a continuous or intermittent \nbasis,  as  necessary.  Areas  of  expertise  will  include  those  needed  to  conduct  economic \nmonitoring, generate new high frequency economic indicators from existing data, and develop \neconomic policy analysis tools and measures linking improved monitoring and analysis with \nPFM, which will be implemented by staff in central banks and finance ministries of Pacific DMCs \nwith the assistance of the TA. Consultant terms of reference are contained in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). To allow quick mobilization of consultants \nin response to Pacific DMCs\u2019 requests, the consultants will be prequalified in accordance with \nthe indefinite delivery contract modality. Disbursement of TA proceeds will conform to ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA is \nestimated to start on 1 January 2014 and be completed on 31 December 2016. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nPacific Economic Management (Phase 2), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "  Appendix 1    5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nAssumptions and/or \nDesign Summary  and Indicators with  Reporting \nRisks \nBaselines  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved economic  By 2019:    The global economic \nperformance and      environment does not \nPFM in participating  3-year average levels of  International Monetary  significantly worsen \nPacific DMCs  national gross domestic  Fund Article IV  over the TA period \nproduct growth increase  reports, national   \nin at least five DMCs  statistical releases  Risk \n(2010\u20132012 average   \nNatural disasters, \nbaseline)   \nwhich could cause \n   \neconomic and \nImprovements in public  Public expenditure \nfinancial shocks \nexpenditure and  and financial \nfinancial assessment  assessment reviews   \nscores in participating \nPacific DMCs (2010\u2013\n2012 baseline) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved economic  By 2016:    Governments commit \npolicies and PFM      resources necessary \nimplemented in  Effective coalitions for  External media  to maintain analytical \nparticipating Pacific  change of key  reports on key  capacity in their \nDMCs  stakeholders active in at  economic  ministries of finance \n  least three Pacific  management and  and central banks \nDMCs that engages in  policy issues  Stakeholders support \neconomic policy    public policy \ndialogue     discussions \n  Government budget   \nAt least 60% of policy  papers and report  Risk \nadvisory initiatives \nPolitical instability \nsuccessfully taken up by \nand personnel \nparticipating DMCs \nchanges in key \n(2013 baseline = 0)  \nministries \n \nPublication of timely and \naccurate reports on \nbudget execution by at \nleast six Pacific DMCs \n(2013 baseline = 0) \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Structure of Consultant Inputs \n \n1.  The Technical Assistance for Pacific Economic Management (phase 2) will support \neconomic  monitoring,  analysis,  and  policy  advice  by  Pacific  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs) in a joint effort with development partners. Consultant inputs will be required to produce \nthe regular outputs and activities of the TA, such as producing the Pacific Economic Monitor and \nco-organizing the Pacific and Papua New Guinea Update Conference. Additionally, experience \nfrom  implementing  the  phase  1  TA  will  provide  various  economic  modeling  and  analysis \nactivities to be conducted with TA support (e.g., expanding the number of Pacific countries with \nfiscal management models by working with ministry of finance staff in the Federated States of \nMicronesia and Timor-Leste). In addition to these planned tasks, the TA will provide resources \nto support south\u2013south exchanges between economic policy makers and technical staff working \nwith the TA on its policy advisory, statistical, or economic modeling activities. \n \n2.  A  mix  of  individual  international  and  national  consultants  will  support  Pacific  DMC \neconomic agencies (mainly ministries of finance and central banks) in strengthening economic \nmonitoring  systems  and  supplementing  these  systems  with  (i)  indicators  tailored  to  the \ncharacteristics of each Pacific DMC economy and (ii) the policy challenges most important in \neach country. These new or enhanced indicators and analysis will be used to provide higher \nquality  policy  advice  to  Pacific  DMCs  and  to  develop  appropriate  economic  management \napproaches.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).   \n \n3.  The types of economic modeling and forecasting tools that will be developed under the \nTA will be determined based on country demand, capacities of each Pacific DMC, availability of \nrequisite data, TA staff knowledge, and perceived needs as assessed by Asian Development \nBank (ADB) economists. Following the success in developing fiscal management models as a \nbudget and fiscal planning and forecasting tool, and the success of the fiscal management \nmodel workshop convened in Suva, Fiji in December 2012 (during which teams made of two to \nthree people from six Pacific DMCs gathered with TA experts to develop and discuss application \nof  fiscal  management  models),  similar  workshops  and  intra-Pacific  exchanges  between \ngovernment economists will be undertaken during the proposed TA. Possible topics for such \nworkshops include estimation of quarterly gross domestic product, estimation of annual poverty \nand inequality indicators, and development of inflation and growth forecasting models. Capacity-\nbuilding efforts will work with mid-level economic and budgeting staff in each Pacific DMC to \nachieve sustainable impact from the TA, minimize the impact of staff turnover, and foster \ndevelopment of broader institutional knowledge and memory. TA consultants will have the ability \nto develop applied economic tools and apply these in reviewing and analyzing policies to form \nnormative policy prescriptions that are consistent with achieving inclusive growth through sound \ninstitutional arrangements. They will have excellent oral and written skills in English, and have \npublishing experience. Proficiency in the use of the ADB style guidelines will also be beneficial. \n \n4.  The  modeling  and  policy  analysis  supported  under  the  proposed  TA  will  draw  on \nrelevant international and regional literature, data, and analyses, including (i) Pacific DMC \nnational plans and national strategies, (ii) the reports and assessments of other development \npartners, (iii) the Pacific Studies Series, including Pacific island economic reports, and (iv) ADB \nproject, sector, and thematic reports. Analysis will pay close attention to lessons from similar \nactivities undertaken in the past to maximize the potential impact and to minimize risk. Efforts \nwill be made to assist Pacific DMC economic managers in publicly disseminating key findings \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n \nfrom the technical analysis to help communities facing evolving economic opportunities mitigate \nadverse impacts and prepare appropriate policy responses. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s Pacific Department, country team leaders, and country economists in the Pacific \nDMC resident missions will coordinate consultant inputs, including liaising with Pacific DMCs, \nother  departments  within  ADB,  and  development  partners.  They  will  also  coordinate  with \nindividual country program managers of other development partners as appropriate. The TA \nproject  office,  with  the  support  of  the  economics  team  in  the  Pacific  Department  director \ngeneral\u2019s office, will have overall responsibility for the project.  \n \n6.  The economic monitoring and tool building work supported through the proposed TA will \nbe undertaken in a phased manner, with research and analyses oriented to assisting informed, \nlocal participation in the formulation of future phases of support. Individual consultants will \ncoordinate  their  work  schedules  and  engage  with  civil  society  and  staff  of  Pacific  DMC \neconomic  agencies,  including  treasuries  and  ministries  of  finance,  central  banks,  planning \noffices, or units and statistics bureaus. \n \nB.
