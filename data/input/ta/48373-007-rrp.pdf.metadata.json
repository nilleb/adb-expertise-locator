THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Bihar New Ganga Bridge Project. The report also describes the proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the Strengthening Bridge Operation and Management Project, and \nif the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will construct a new road bridge (the new Ganga Bridge) across the Ganges \nRiver and an integrated approach roadway network in the state of Bihar. It will improve transport \nconnectivity between north and south Bihar, which is divided by the Ganges River, and better \nlink Patna, the state capital city, and the surrounding areas. The main bridge structure of about \n9.8 kilometers (km) is expected to become the longest river bridge in India. It will have a \ntransformational impact by promoting the geographical integration of Bihar, and help balance \nthe benefits of social economic development. In the regional context, it is strategically located \nnear India\u2019s neighboring country of Nepal, and will enhance the existing road corridors between \nthe two countries. This will lead to greater physical cross-border connectivity, which is supported \nby the Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Bihar is the 12th largest state in India by area, the 3rd most populous with about \n104 million inhabitants, and the 6th most densely populated. It is in the eastern region of the \ncountry, bordering Uttar Pradesh in the west, West Bengal in the east, and Jharkhand in the \nsouth.  The  Ganges  River  flows  through  the  middle  of  the  Bihar  plain  from  west  to  east, \nphysically dividing the state into northern and southern regions. The northern region is bound by \nNepal. Bihar has lagged behind other states in terms of social and economic development. \nAccording  to  Government  of  India  estimates  based  on  2011\u20132012  data,  34%  of  Bihar\u2019s \npopulation lives below the poverty line, compared with 22% nationally.3 Bihar continues to be at \nthe bottom among major states in India with per capita income in 2013\u20132014 of only 39% \n(Rs15,650) of the national average (Rs39,904), although the gap has since narrowed thanks to \nincreased investment in social infrastructure and improved governance.4 \n \n4.  The problem of low per capita income in Bihar is accentuated by the physical north\u2013\nsouth divide. In 2012, district-wise per capita gross domestic product was on average 40% \nhigher among districts in the south (footnote 4). Among the 38 districts of the state, 7 of the 10 \nmost prosperous districts were in the south, while 7 of the 10 poorest districts were in the north. \nThis disparity is clearly attributed to the Ganges River and its enormous scale, which makes \nproviding connectivity between north and south Bihar a very difficult task. Currently, along the \nentire  length  of the Ganges  River  in  Bihar (approximately  200 km), only  four  bridges  are \noperational, and the combined capacity is far too limited to meet traffic demand.5 This not only \nconstrains connectivity but also overall socioeconomic development.6 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. \n3  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013. Press Note on Poverty Estimates, 2011\u20132012. Delhi. \n4  Government of Bihar, Finance Department. 2015. Economic Survey, 2014\u20132015. Patna. \n5  As shown on the map, three bridges are between north and south Bihar (Gandhi Setu, Rajendra Setu, and \nVikramshila Setu), and one bridge is between south Bihar at Buxar and the state of Uttar Pradesh in the west. \n6  The combined volume\u2013capacity ratio is currently about 1.6\u2014already three times higher than the desired level. ", "2 \n5.  Four new bridges are under construction at critical locations to help remove the growing \nconstraint on connectivity.7 Moreover, the proposed project will construct a new Ganga Bridge, \nlocated about 10 km downstream and east of Patna. The main objective is to provide badly \nneeded additional capacity, and improve connectivity for Patna and the surrounding areas. This \nincludes the Raghopur Diara river island, which is situated and cut off in between two channels \nof the Ganges River. Its 250,000 inhabitants now have only a seasonal link (pontoon bridge) \nconnecting it to Patna, apart from boats. The new Ganga Bridge will span the entire width of the \nGanges River, including the two channels, with access ramps to the Raghopur Diara river \nisland, and connect to nearby national highways along the north and south banks of the Ganges \nRiver. It will also serve as an alternative to the existing Ganga Bridge (also called Mahatma \nGandhi Bridge), which currently is the main link between Patna and north Bihar. The old bridge \nis deteriorating and has insufficient capacity, which sees severe traffic congestion.8 \n \n6.  The new Ganga Bridge, together with the other bridges already under construction, will \nprovide the required transport capacity between north and south Bihar, and significantly improve \nconnectivity. It will substantially reduce the travel time to Patna from the surrounding regions, in \nparticular north Bihar, which will ease access to the state\u2019s administrative and social services, \nand health and higher education facilities. The inhabitants of the Raghopur Diara river island will \ngain year-round road access, allowing children access to higher-level schooling and women \nbetter access to pre- and postnatal health care. It will help balance the benefits of developments \nin agriculture, tourism, and industrial sectors, and contribute to achieving the priority goal of the \nGovernment of Bihar\u2014to connect Patna to the remotest areas in the state, so that people can \nreach the capital in no more than 6 hours from any place within the state.  \n \n7.  The Government of Bihar has stepped up investments in the development of quality \ninfrastructure. Since 2008, ADB has provided three loans totaling $1.02 billion to upgrade 1,466 \nkm of state highways in north and south Bihar, linking rural areas to national highways. With \nthese collectively, the new Ganga Bridge will improve mobility and accessibility between north \nand south Bihar, and is critical to ensuring that the overall development impact is optimized and \nits benefits are fully reaped. The new bridge is integral to the vision and action plan of the Road \nMaster Plan for Bihar\u2019s State Highways Development, a 20-year strategy (2015\u20132035) prepared \nwith ADB assistance to direct further investment into fostering overall economic development in \nthe state.9 \n \n8.  Regional connectivity. In the context of regional connectivity with India\u2019s neighboring \ncountries,  the  new  Ganga  Bridge  is  strategically  located  at  about  190  km southeast from \nRaxaul, an Indian border town across from Birgunj in Nepal, which enables major cross-border \nmovement  of  goods  and  people  between  the  two  countries.  The  bridge  will  allow  better \ndistribution of traffic on the road network, which includes the international and regional trade \ncorridors that connect Nepal to the eastern, northern, and northeastern states of India, including \naccess  to  ports  at  Kolkata  and  Haldia  in West  Bengal.10 The  project  complements  ADB\u2019s \nongoing support to the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation.11 \n                                                \n7  As shown on the map, two bridges by the Government of Bihar (Arrah\u2013Chhapra and Bakhiarpur, to be operational \nin 2018), and two rail-cum-road bridges by the Government of India (Digha and Munger, to be operational in 2017). \n8  Urgent repairs are being made to maintain operations on the Ganga Bridge, albeit at reduced capacity, while the \nGovernment of India is considering options for its complete rehabilitation. \n9  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Road Master Plan for Bihar\u2019s State Highway Development. Manila (TA 8170-\nIND, $1,000,000, approved on 20 September). \n10  Asian Highway No. 42, which is also the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Corridor 2. \n11 The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program is a project-based partnership that aims to strengthen \ncross-border transport networks that boost intraregional trade in the subregion (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the \nMaldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka). \n ", "3 \n9.  Sustainable maintenance. In 2013, the Government of Bihar enacted the Bihar Road \nAssets Maintenance Policy, which requires the execution of maintenance works throughout the \ndesign life of road infrastructure in place and under construction. The annual maintenance \nbudget has more than doubled\u2014from Rs3.500 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2012 to Rs8.932 billion \nin FY2015\u2014thanks to increasing revenue from vehicle registration and license fees. Long-term \nperformance-based maintenance by the private sector is also being encouraged to provide \ngreater efficiency. In keeping with this, the contract for the new Ganga Bridge also includes \npost-completion  performance-based  maintenance  for  5  years,  to  be  financed  by  the  state \ngovernment. This approach, and a contract modality that combines engineering, procurement, \nand construction, optimizes incentives for design and construction quality while allowing the use \nof best practices and innovations for efficiency and economy. It emphasizes efficient use of \navailable resources, and this is consistent with one of ADB\u2019s strategic drivers of change being \nadapted in the development of the private sector. \n \n10.  Climate  change  resilience.  The  probability  analysis  of  rainfall  extremes  over  the \nGanges basin has shown a growing trend in maximum 1-day rainfall and in the count of \nconsecutive rainfall days.12 In view of this, the new Ganga Bridge will span from bank to bank \nover the two river channels and the Raghopur Diara river island. This helps minimize effects on \nthe river regime and is an important climate adaptation measure because the alternative option \nof constructing an embankment road on Raghopur Diara river island, while less costly, could be \nvulnerable to floods. The bridge will also meet the navigation clearance requirements of India\u2019s \nInland Waterways Authority, e.g., vertical clearance of 10 meters from the highest recorded \nflood level, and horizontal clearance of 100 meters between two piers of the bridge. This is \nmaintained throughout the entire bridge length to accommodate the possibility of any future \nchanges in the river morphology and meandering of the river channels. \n \n11.  Finance plus. The new Ganga Bridge will have a transformational impact by promoting \nthe  geographical  integration  of  Bihar  and  helping  balance  the  benefits  of  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. It will also have a systemic impact on large-scale bridge design and construction \nin India by introducing new engineering and technology, a first of its kind and scale in India.13 \nThis also includes the implementation of stringent environmental safeguard measures, and a \nbiodiversity conservation plan that will monitor changes to the local biodiversity in the project \narea and implement conservation activities to avoid any net loss of biodiversity as a result of the \nproject. These activities will be carried out by a joint venture of reputed international and \nnational  design\u2013build  contractors,  and  supervised  by  international  and  national  experts, \ncomprising a project management consulting team. This will enable the local industries to gain \nvaluable experience and know-how that can be replicated for greater benefits in the future. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be improved mobility and accessibility within India, and connectivity with \nits neighboring countries.14 The outcome will be improved transport connectivity across the \nGanges River between north and south Bihar. \n \n                                                \n12  Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management Reporting (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n13  The adopted extradosed bridge design incorporates characteristics of a cable-stayed and externally stressed \nconcrete-box segmental structure, which optimizes economy and efficiency. It will become the longest river bridge \nin India. \n14  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013. Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012\u20132017 Economic Sectors. Volume \nII.

The project output will be the construction of the new Ganga Bridge and an integrated \napproach roadway network consisting of about 9.8 km of bridge structures, about 10 km of \napproach viaduct and embankments, widening of about 3 km of NH-103, and tolling and service \nfacilities from Deedargunj on NH-30 in Patna district to Chak Sikandar in Vaishali district on NH-\n103.  The  loan  will  also  finance  consulting  services  for  project  management  and  authority \nengineer team, and external monitor for environmental safeguards. The TA will enhance bridge \noperation and management capacity by financing the preparation of an operation management \nplan for the new Ganga Bridge, development of model maintenance manuals for existing major \nbridges in Bihar, and transfer of knowledge in international best practices for bridge operation \nand management. \n \nD.

Interest during construction for the ADB loan has been computed at \nthe 5-year forward London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus a spread of 0.5% and applicable maturity-based \npremium of 10 basis points. Commitment charges for an ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the \nundisbursed loan amount.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n15.  The Government of India has requested a loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions to be set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.  \n \n ", "5 \n16.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n19.  A capacity development TA is proposed to accompany the project. The objective of the \nTA is to enhance existing institutional capacity necessary to effectively operate and manage the \nnew Ganga Bridge and other major bridges in the state. The key outputs and activities involve \n(i)  preparing  an  operation  management  plan  for  the  new  Ganga  Bridge  that  covers \ncomprehensively all relevant aspects, including administration and organization, user services \nand quality, inspection, and maintenance procedures; (ii) developing a model maintenance \nmanual for major bridges in about four selected districts, which can be replicated for other \n                                                \n15  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \ndistricts in the state and which includes conducting condition surveys, prioritizing maintenance \nrequirements, preparing cost estimates, and formulating a rolling work plan and budget; and (iii) \nlearning international best practices, including on-the-job training of managers and technical \nstaff  during  the  above  TA  activities,  in-house  technical  workshops,  and  overseas  training, \nincluding case studies and observations.16 \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $900,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The Government of \nBihar acting through BSRDCL will be the executing agency. BSRDCL will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe TA will be implemented from January 2017 to December 2018. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  The location and alignment of the bridge and the approach road network are considered \nbest among the alternatives reviewed during project preparation given the existing road network \npattern,  as  well  as  minimal  land  acquisition,  dislocation,  and  environmental  impact.  A \nhydrological survey of the Ganges River in the influence area was conducted and the historical \ndata was collected from the Central Water Commission, which established the basis for the \nhydraulic design parameters, such as the river discharge and highest flood level. The main \nstructure adopted is an extradosed bridge, which incorporates characteristics of cable stay and \nexternally prestressed concrete box segmental structure, optimizing economy and efficiency for \nconstruction and maintenance in accordance with applicable international design standards. \nThe environmental management plan includes provisions requiring the contractor to ensure the \nsafety of workers and mitigate the accident risk from construction activities. \n \n22.  Road safety. The project management and authority engineer team will conduct a road \nsafety  audit  and  assessment,  and  make  sure  that  any  countermeasures  proposed  are \nincorporated in the detailed design. The team will also collaborate with a local nongovernment \norganization (NGO) to be engaged by BSRDCL for rehabilitation and resettlement activities. The \nNGO will also conduct road safety awareness campaigns in the local communities and secure \nthe participation of women and school teachers for dissemination to children. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  An economic analysis was carried out by comparing the societal cost of transportation \nwith and without the project, considering the benefits of better connectivity between north and \nsouth Bihar as well as all-year connectivity to Raghopur Diara river island and its 250,000 \ninhabitants. The project will add capacity across the Ganges River and enable shorter travel \ntimes within its influence area. The added capacity will help decrease traffic on other bridges up- \nand  downstream,  thus  reducing  congestion,  improving  travel  times,  and  lowering  vehicle \noperating costs on these bridges. The analysis also considered the transport cost savings to \ninhabitants of the Raghopur Diara river island. Without the project, those inhabitants depend on \nboats for most of the year and a seasonal pontoon bridge, making the transport of passengers \nand goods very costly, and reducing the residents\u2019 ability to market the produce from their fertile \nland. Taking into account the benefits arising from the project, the economic internal rate of \nreturn is estimated at 16%, indicating that the project is viable in social cost\u2013benefit terms. The \n                                                \n16  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nsensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible unfavorable scenarios resulting from changes \nin the key parameters that determine the project\u2019s costs and benefits. The economic viability \nremained satisfactory at an economic internal rate of return of 13.7-14.9% above the 12% \ncutoff. The project will also provide large additional benefits to the residents of the Raghopur \nDiara river island in terms of better access to education and health facilities, and increased \nmarketability of their produce, thus improving their socioeconomic situation. \n \n24.  The Government of Bihar intends to collect user fees in the form of toll charges, except \nfor traffic from Raghopur Diara river island. A financial analysis was carried out to assess the \nviability of meeting the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. It was done on an incremental \nbasis using the discounted cash flow method and calculating the internal rate of return of the \nproject. The capital cost includes construction of the bridge and its approaches. The O&M cost \nincludes routine and periodic maintenance of the facility created. All financial projections are in \n2015 nominal Indian rupees with no adjustment for inflation. The estimated financial internal rate \nof return for the project in real terms is 4.6%, which is above the estimated weighted average \ncost of capital of 2.3%. The cash flow projections indicate that the project would generate \nsufficient liquid cash resources to allow the project to meet its O&M costs and meet debt service \nobligations over the analysis period. BSRDCL\u2019s financial health is in good standing overall.17 \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  Policy, legal, and institutional capacity. BSRDCL was incorporated on 20 April 2009 \nunder the Companies Act of 1956, and is a wholly owned company of the Government of Bihar, \nestablished  to  develop,  execute, manage,  and  maintain  all  types  of  roads,  highways,  and \nbridges. BSRDCL has an 11-member board of directors and is headed by a managing director, \nwith about 108 staff members.18 The corporate structure was developed along good-practice \nprinciples, and a sound culture is emerging with an understanding of company values, which \naim to provide high-class standards with regard to safety, performance, and user satisfaction, \nand to operate under sound ethical standards. \n \n26.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted, \nconsidering the capacity of BSRDCL, including fund-flow arrangements, governance, staffing, \nbudgeting, accounting and financial reporting systems, internal control procedures, financial \ninformation  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements.  BSRDCL  follows  a \ndouble-entry,  accrual  accounting  and  reporting  process,  in  accordance  with  the  generally \naccepted accounting principles in India, and in compliance with the relevant provisions of the \nCompanies Act of 2013 to the extent applicable. BSRDCL is experienced and familiar with \nmanaging  ADB-financed  projects.  Further  improvements  to  reporting  procedures  and \naccounting software are described in the PAM. The overall financial management arrangements \nare considered satisfactory, and the overall risk is moderate. \n \n27.  Procurement and anticorruption measures. All procurement of goods and works will \nbe undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto time). All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and BSRDCL. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n                                                \n17  The recurrent cost for the project is about 2.8% of BSRDCL\u2019s annual expenditure. \n18  The current managing director is the secretary of the Road Construction Department. The board is chaired by the \ndevelopment commissioner of the Government of Bihar. \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  A poverty and social survey of 366 households was conducted, and 8 focus group \ndiscussions were held in 18 villages. Respondents felt that the project would make access and \nmobility more reliable. The project will greatly benefit northern Bihar, including the Raghopur \nDiara river island, where socioeconomic indicators are low and the lack of reliable connectivity \nhas hindered growth and development. Improved cross-river connectivity will allow residents in \nthe north to transport their products more quickly to market centers in the south, and will also \nimprove their profit margins since they will no longer depend solely on local markets and \nmiddlemen, or face long transport times. An estimated 9.3 million people live in the project \ndistricts and will experience the economic benefits brought about by the project.19 \n \n29.  Gender and development. Most women in the project area are involved in household \nwork. The project will improve connectivity, giving them better access to health services, higher \nlevels  of  education,  economic  opportunities,  and  social  interactions.  Women  living  on  the \nnorthern banks of the Ganges River and on the Raghopur Diara island will benefit in particular. \nLand acquisition and resettlement will affect 56 households headed by women. Special attention \nwill be given to these households to ensure that they are equally well or better off than before \nthe  project.  Meaningful  consultations  with  women  guided  the  design  of  practical  and \nimplementable gender-proactive features: (i) gender-sensitive design of project components, \nincluding separate toilets and rest areas for men and women, and lighting for pedestrians; \n(ii) grassroots road safety and safe mobility campaigns involving the participation of women, \nwith a target of 30% as trained facilitators and 50% as beneficiaries; and (iii) awareness training \non issues related to sexually transmitted infections for all project-affected communities and all \ncontractors\u2019 staff before and during construction, targeting a 50% participation rate for women. \nCivil works contracts will have provisions to ensure that all applicable labor laws are complied \nwith, including equal pay for men and women for work of equal value. Contractors are also \nencouraged to employ local women. \n \n30.  HIV/AIDS and trafficking. Bihar is characterized as a low-HIV-prevalence state with an \nestimated adult HIV prevalence of 0.20%, lower than the national rate of 0.27%. Of 123,873 \npeople  in  Bihar  estimated  to  be  living  with  HIV/AIDS,  39%  are  women.  Major  efforts  in \nawareness building, prevention, and treatment are undertaken by the health department and the \nBihar AIDS Control Society at the state, district, and block levels. Based on public consultations, \nthe  project  incorporates  measures  to  mitigate  HIV/AIDS  risks,  such  as  NGOs  undertaking \nsemiannual  awareness  programs  at  construction  sites  and  in  project-influenced  areas,  in \nparticular at important village locations and in schools and offices. Awareness-building will be \nconducted separately for men and women to discuss gender-specific issues. To combat the risk \nof human trafficking, the Government of Bihar launched a program in 2007 to prevent the \n \ntrafficking of women and children and to ensure comprehensive rehabilitation for victims. Also, \ninternational NGOs are implementing awareness-building and prevention programs in Bihar. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) because of the presence of the Gangetic Dolphin and the \nGanges softshell turtle, and the potential presence of the Gharial in the project area. According \nto the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Gangetic Dolphin is endangered, Ganges \nsoftshell turtle is vulnerable, and Gharial is critically endangered. They are also protected under \n                                                \n19  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nthe Wildlife Protection Act of India. Although the project area is not a critical habitat for these \nspecies,  the  large  project  scope  requires  sourcing,  transport,  and  storage  of  substantial \nconstruction,  labor,  equipment,  and  material  resources.  The  draft  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 1 December 2015. Potential significant \nimpacts entail destruction and disturbance of the natural habitat from on-site noise, vibration, air \nand water pollution, and increased sediment load in the river. The location, timing, and method \nof  construction  will  avoid  and  minimize  impacts  on  the  natural  habitat.  A  biodiversity \nconservation plan will be implemented to avoid any net loss of biodiversity. Other anticipated \nimpacts involve dust, noise, exhaust, construction and domestic waste, water contamination, \noccupational health and safety, erosion, siltation, and traffic congestion. Measures to manage \nthese have been included in the environmental management plan, which will be updated by the \ncontractor. Meaningful consultations were held with affected persons and key stakeholders, \nsuch as the local Forestry Department, Zoological Survey of India, Patna University, and the \nWorld Wildlife  Fund,  and  their  recommendations  were  incorporated  in  the  EIA.  The  EIA\u2019s \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  will  further  alleviate  any  concerns  of  affected  persons  and \nrelevant stakeholders during project implementation. \n \n32.  BSRDCL will be responsible for ensuring the implementation of environment safeguards \nunder the project. Two technical managers of the bridge construction works will be responsible \nfor managing environmental and social safeguards. The project management and authority \nengineer  team  will  include  an  environmental  and  biodiversity  specialist  to  supervise  the \nimplementation of environment safeguards. The civil works contractor will employ environmental \nexperts to ensure proper implementation of the EIA and the environmental management plan. \nAn external monitor will be recruited to conduct third-party monitoring of the implementation and \nsupervision  of  environmental  safeguards,  and  the  implementation  of  the  biodiversity \nconservation plan. The project management and authority engineer team will conduct training \nworkshops and on-site training on how to implement environment safeguards for BSRDCL staff \nand the contractor. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is classified as category A in accordance with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Project components are designed to minimize land acquisition and \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  A  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  line  with  the  Right  to  Fair \nCompensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement Act \n(2013), and the Safeguard Policy Statement, and has been disclosed.20 About 256.58 acres of \nprivate land will be acquired, affecting 18,171 persons or 1,594 households, and 153 private \nstructures.  Of  the  households,  1,509  will  experience  economic  displacement  and  85  will \nexperience physical displacement. Displaced persons will be compensated at replacement cost, \nand rates for different categories of loss and special assistance are detailed in the resettlement \nplan. The estimated cost of land acquisition and resettlement is about $127.6 million. Impacts \nhave been thoroughly assessed, and the measures proposed in the resettlement plan are \ncommensurate to the assessed impacts. BSRDCL is experienced in implementing ADB projects \nand is committed to implementing the resettlement plan. BSRDCL will engage an NGO to assist \nwith implementing the resettlement plan, and the project management and authority engineer \nteam\u2019s resettlement specialist will be the external monitor. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples. The project is categorized as C in accordance with the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. Due diligence confirms that no indigenous peoples are present in the project \nimpact area. \n                                                \n20 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \nhttp://www.adb.org/projects/documents/ind-bihar-new-ganga-bridge-project-dec-2015-rp \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  The  overall  risk  assessment  is  low,  while  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProject startup is delayed The advanced procurement action was expedited in accordance with ADB \nand disbursement is  requirements under retroactive financing.
