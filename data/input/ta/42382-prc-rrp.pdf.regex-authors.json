An environmental impact assessment was completed. \nAssessment  The summary environmental impact assessment was circulated to \nthe Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nposted on the ADB website on 19 November 2008. \n   \nProject Description  The Project aims to help promote balanced and environmentally \nsustainable urbanization; narrow the urban\u2013rural gap; and improve \nproduction, employment, and living conditions in small cities and \ntowns  in  Liaoning  Province.  It  will  support  the  development  of \nselected small cities and towns in the province. The Project is being \nprocessed  as  a  sector  loan  to  allow  the  Liaoning  provincial \ngovernment (LPG) to respond to rapidly changing needs of cities \nand towns across the province. The Project includes about seven \nsubprojects,  including  three  core  subprojects\u2014Donggang  City, \nKazuo  Mongolian  Autonomous  County,  and  Linghai  City. \nSubsequent subprojects will be selected, prepared, and appraised \nduring project implementation following an agreed set of criteria and \nprocedures.  The  Donggang  City  core  subproject  has  three \ncomponents:  (i)  roads  and  bridge,  and  associated  services; \n(ii) drainage and wastewater treatment; and (iii) river improvement \nand area upgrading. The Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County \ncore subproject has one water supply component. The Linghai City \ncore subproject has one component for construction and upgrading \nof roads, and associated services.  \n   \nRationale  The PRC Government is committed to developing small cities and \ntowns as a way to generate jobs, narrow the rural\u2013urban income \ngap, and increase national economic productivity. Growth of small \ncities  and  towns  creates  economic  opportunities  for  farmers  to \nmove to urban areas and gain higher value-added employment; this \nis the key to realizing the PRC\u2019s vision of a \u201charmonious society,\u201d in \nwhich the benefits of growth will be shared more equitably. The \nPRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP) 2006\u20132010 identifies small city \nand town development as a means to provide a higher standard of \nliving to rural migrants without exacerbating infrastructure fatigue \nand  other  problems  afflicting  large  cities.  Building  on  the \nconclusions of the ADB-financed Town-Based Urbanization Strategy ", "ii   \nStudy, the national town development policy calls for strengthening \nphysical  and  economic  linkages  between  major  cities  in \nmetropolitan  areas  or  development  corridors  and  the  smaller \nsettlements  at  their  periphery,  and  stresses  the  development  of \nsmall  cities  and  towns  by  facilitating  the  development  of  larger \nurban agglomerations. \n \nLiaoning  Province,  located  in  the  southern  part  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nnortheast,  functions  as  a  major  hub  between  the  PRC\u2019s \nnortheastern economic region and the Pan-Bohai economic region. \nHistorically a base for industrial materials and machinery, it has \nfaced  economic  challenges  related  to  industrial  restructuring \nmoving  from  state-owned  heavy  industries  to  light  and  service \nindustries to promote balanced development and focus on growth \nbased on economic demand. Many state firms have closed or are \nexperiencing major losses. While state investment has aided the \nindustrial transformation, local governments, particularly small cities \nand towns, have had difficulty finding catalysts for new employment \nand economic growth. Small cities and towns in the province have \nmade progress in recent years in facilitating economic growth, but \nstill lag the big cities. The rapid development and race to urbanize \nand industrialize have left many with significant pollution problems \nand  correspondingly  poor  living  conditions,  and  outstripped  the \ncapacity to provide services. More jobs are also needed to stimulate \ngrowth driven by domestic demand instead of relying on exports. \nWhile  many  small  cities  and  towns  have  made  significant \ninvestments  in  different  types  of  urban  infrastructure,  few  have \ndeveloped an integrated approach to the development of various \ninfrastructure sectors. LPG is promoting the development of small \ncities and towns in a more coordinated and cost-effective manner \nby  encouraging  more  sustainable  investments  in  physical  and \nenvironmental protection infrastructure to improve the quality of life \nand create conditions favorable for a strategic shift of the rural labor \nforce. \n \nThe Project is a direct response to Liaoning\u2019s 11FYP to promote \nsustainable economic development, particularly in its small cities \nand towns, via construction and upgrading of road infrastructure, \nwater supply, and environmental improvement. All components in \nthe Project are integral components of the 11FYP. The proposed \nsubprojects  focus  on  supporting  sustainable  urban  development \nand comprise a number of sector interventions primarily targeted to \nsupport job creation, economic growth, environmental protection, \nimprovement of infrastructure and municipal services, and industrial \ndevelopment,  to  address  key  infrastructure  sector  issues  in  the \nsubproject  cities  and  towns.  The  main  sectors  are  roads  and \nassociated  services,  water  and  wastewater,  solid  waste \nmanagement, river improvement and area upgrading, and district \nheating. ADB\u2019s experience and knowledge in urban environmental \nimprovement  and  management,  including  supporting  utility  tariff \nreforms, will add value to the Project, especially for small cities and \ntowns  undergoing  urbanization  and  economic  transformation. ", "  iii\nTo allow greater flexibility during project implementation, the Project \nuses a sector loan approach and develops subproject identification, \nselection,  and  appraisal  criteria  and  procedures  to  achieve  the \nobjectives of sector policies and plans. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impacts  of  the  Project  are  improved  living  conditions  and \nincreased  employment  generation  in  small  cities  and  towns  in \nLiaoning  Province.  The  project  outcome  is  improved  urban \ninfrastructure and municipal services in about seven small cities \nand towns in the province. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $236.5 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $16.0 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Amount  % of \nSource \n($ million equivalent)  Total \nAsian Development Bank Loan  100.0  42.3 \nMulti-Donor Trust Fund under the Water  0.3  0.0 \nFinancing Partnership Facilitya \nDonggang City Government  49.7  21.0 \nKazuo Mongolian Autonomous County  7.6  3.2 \nGovernment \nLinghai City Government  17.2  7.3 \nOther City and County Governments  61.7  26.2 \n  Total  236.5b  100.0 \n  a  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, and Norway.

The loan will have a 26-year term \nincluding a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. \n   \nAllocation and  The PRC Government will relend the loan proceeds to LPG, the \nRelending Terms  Executing Agency, on the same terms and conditions as the ADB \nloan. LPG will then onlend the loan proceeds to the subproject \nmunicipal,  city,  and  county  governments  and  then  to  the \nimplementing agencies on the same terms and conditions as those \nof  the  ADB  loan.  The  end-borrowers  will  assume  the  foreign \nexchange rate variation risks of the ADB loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2016 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2015 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Liaoning  Provincial  Government  through  the  Provincial  Project \nCoordination Group \n   \n ", "iv   \nImplementation  The Provincial Project Coordination Group comprising the Liaoning \nArrangements  Finance  Bureau,  Development  and  Reform  Commission, \nConstruction Bureau, Land Resources Bureau, Audit Bureau, Price \nBureau, and Environmental Protection Bureau will provide overall \nguidance,  supervision,  and  support  to  project  preparation  and \nimplementation. A Liaoning project management office (PMO) was \nestablished  to  undertake  and  manage  day-to-day  activities  in \nconnection with the Project, including selection and appraisal of \nsubsequent subprojects. In each subproject city and town, a PMO \nhas been set up to liaise with the Liaoning PMO and departments \nand  bureaus  concerned,  and  to  oversee  and  manage  (i)  work \nundertaken  by  the  implementing  agencies,  (ii)  overall  project \nfinance, and (iii) project implementation. \n   \nProcurement  Goods, works, and services will be procured in accordance with \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  International  competitive  bidding,  national  competitive \nbidding,  or  shopping  procedures  will  be  used  for  procurement, \nbased on the circumstances of each contract package. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  provide  funding  for  international  and  national \nconsulting  services  to  support  the  PMOs  and  implementing \nagencies  with  project  implementation,  management,  and \ninstitutional  capacity  building.  The  consulting  services  will  cover \n(i) project management, (ii) the project performance management \nsystem, (iii) financial management, (iv) social and environmental \nsupport,  (v)  operation  and  maintenance,  and  (vi)  institutional \nstrengthening.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  benefit  260,000  residents  of  the  three  core \nBeneficiaries  subproject cities and towns of Liaoning, as well as residents of four \nsubsequent subproject cities and towns that have a total urban \npopulation  of  about  660,000.  The  percentage  of  poor  among \nbeneficiaries in the three core subproject towns is 9.0% in Kazuo, \n4.5%  in  Linghai,  and  3.5%  in  Donggang.  Major  socioeconomic \nimpacts  include  (i)  improvement  of  living  standards  through  the \nprovision of essential public infrastructure; (ii) improvement of public \nhealth  through  infrastructure  and  environmental  improvement; \n(iii) improvement of the quality and affordability of basic services; \n(iv) job creation; (v) environmental protection through improvement \nof the sewage collection system and flood control; (vi) facilitation of \nmobility,  access,  and  affordability  of  key  basic  services  and \ndestinations through road construction; and (vii) provision of skills \ntraining. \n \nThe  infrastructure  improvements  financed  under  the  Project  are \nanticipated  to  produce  substantial  environmental  and  economic \nbenefits. Provision of water supply will have quantifiable impacts on \npublic health in terms of savings made on medical consultations \nand purchase of medicines. This will reduce domestic work, largely ", "  v\nundertaken  by  women,  such  as  water  collection  and  disposal, \ncleaning, and caring for the sick. Jobs created will attract surplus \nrural labor to urban areas and address unemployment, provide new \nskills to workers, and stimulate a number of secondary industries. \n   \nThe Project will contribute to climate change adaptation through \nmeasures to improve flood control and strengthen water resources \nmanagement in the subproject cities and towns that are prone to \nincreasing floods and droughts. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks. \nConventional engineering designs with proven records of reliable \nperformance will be adopted for (i) road and bridge construction, \n(ii) installation of municipal services along roads, (iii) water supply \nand  wastewater  management,  (iv)  river  improvement  and  area \nupgrading, (v) solid waste treatment, (vi) environmental sanitation, \n(vii) heating, and (viii) landscaping. During implementation, the loan \nimplementation consultant will support the PMOs and implementing \nagencies to ensure that equipment and works comply with design \nand quality assurance requirements. \n \nThe following risks could affect the timely implementation, economic \nviability, and realization of project benefits: inadequate preparation \nand late selection, appraisal, and implementation of subsequent \nsubprojects;  failure  to  implement  institutional  strengthening  for \neffective project implementation and management, and corporate \ngovernance; lack of proper operation and maintenance of project \nfacilities; late consultant selection; delay in completion of associated \nprojects; major amendments and changes to implementation of the \nmaster plans in subproject cities and towns; delay in the provision \nof counterpart funding; failure to establish or increase water and \nwastewater tariffs to meet cost recovery targets; and unforeseen \nland acquisition and resettlement issues, which could hamper the \nefficient  implementation  of  project  works  and  the  restoration  of \nlivelihoods of affected persons. \n \nThese  risks  will  be  mitigated  through  effective  institutional \narrangements and project management; extensive and appropriate \ntraining  on  ADB  and  domestic  procedures  and  requirements; \nprovision of institutional capacity building, and appropriate project \nimplementation and monitoring arrangements for the subproject city \nand town PMOs and implementing agencies with support from the \nloan  implementation  consultant;  synchronization  of  the  project \ndesign  and  implementation  schedules  with  associated  projects \nplanned; covenanted assurances from the subproject city and town \ngovernments  on  the  provision  of  counterpart  funding,  and  on \nregular  tariff  reviews  and  increases;  strengthening  of  internal \nmonitoring and supervision by the Liaoning subproject city and town \nPMOs  and  the  implementing  agencies;  and  engagement  of  a \nqualified external agency to monitor and evaluate resettlement. \n \n ", "114 o 00'E 122 o 00'E Siping 124 o 00'E\nI N N E R     M O N G O L I A J I L I N\nShenyang Tieling\nL I A O N I N G\nLinghai LIAONING SMALL CITIES AND\nKazuo Liaoyang\n41 o 00'N Zhangijakou Jinxi Yingkou 41 o 00'N TOWNS DEVELOPMENT\nShanhaiguan Donggang DEMONSTRATION SECTOR PROJECT\nYouyuDatong BEIJING Tianjin TangshanQinhuangdao IN THE\nBazhou\nYuanping H E B E I T I A N J I N Dalian PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nZhufutun Bohai   Sea\nS H A N X I Shijiazhuang\nTaiyuan\nZhaozhou\nJinzhou\nWutong Pingyao\nS H A N D O N G\n36 o 00'N Xiangyuan Pingshun 36 o 00'N\nHouma Jincheng Yellow   Sea\nH E N A N\n114 o 00'E 122 o 00'E\n120 o 00'E Siping\n43 o 00'N 43 o 00'N\nI N N E R     M O N G O L I A\nJ I L I N\nTieling\nFuxin\nXinmin\nNanzamu\nHeishan Fushun\nChaoyang Beizhen SHENYANG\nLingyuan Goubangzi Liaozhong\nLiaoyang\nKazuo Linghai Panjin Benxi\nJinzhou\nAnshan Nanfen\nJianchang\nJinxi\nHaicheng\nL I A O N I N G Kuandian\nYingkou\nH E B E I Suizhong\nGai Zhou Fengcheng Gushan\nLiaodong  Bay\nDandong\nDonggang\nZhuanghe\nXinjin\n39 o 00'N Core Subproject City/Town 39 o 00'N\nProvincial Capital\nDalian\nCity/Town\nNational Road\nN Provincial Road\nRailway\nB o h a i     G u l f\nRiver\n0 20 40 60 80 Provincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nKilometers Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n120 o 00'E 124 o 00'E\n09-2967 HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the \nWater  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  both  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the \nLiaoning Small Cities and Towns Development Demonstration Sector Project. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The stakeholders analysis, and problems and objectives \ntree analyses are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n2.  The  Government  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  improve  urban \ninfrastructure and municipal services in about seven small cities and towns in Liaoning Province by \nconstructing  and  upgrading  roads,  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  heating,  and  other \nenvironmental services to facilitate sustainable and inclusive economic development and enhance \nthe quality of life of residents, including the poor, in the less developed small urban settlements in \nthe province.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Since the 1980s, the PRC Government has progressively relaxed migration policies to \naccess  low-cost  rural  labor.  The  urban  population  has  tripled,  reaching  577  million  in  2006, \naccounting for 44% of the total population; it is expected to exceed 50% by 2015. The urban\u2013rural \nincome gap is large; the average disposable income of urban residents is about 3.3 times the \naverage net income of farmers in 2006. With increasing mechanization in the agriculture sector, \nmillions of rural migrants seek employment in urban areas each year. The challenges of providing \nemployment, housing, and services to the urban population are massive. The Government favors \nurbanization as a means to increase national economic productivity and promote harmonious \ndevelopment, in which the benefits of economic growth will be shared more equitably. The 11th \nFive-Year Plan (FYP) 2006\u20132010 continues the policy of promoting the development of small cities \nand towns, which has the potential to (i) provide higher living standards to migrants without \nexacerbating infrastructure capacity and problems afflicting large cities, (ii) increase productivity, \nand (iii) narrow the income gap, thereby contributing to social stability. 1 It proposes \u201ccoordinated \ndevelopment of big, medium and small cities and small towns\u201d and identifies urban agglomerations \nas the main model for future urbanization. Building on the conclusions of the ADB-financed Town-\nBased Urbanization Strategy Study, 2 the 11FYP proposes strengthening physical and economic \nlinkages between major cities in metropolitan areas or major development corridors and smaller \nsettlements at their periphery. \n \n4.  Over the last 20 years, economic progress in the PRC has largely taken place in large \nmetropolitan  regions  and  provincial  capitals  with  better  access  to  resources.  In  large  cities \ninfrastructure networks such as transport, water supply, wastewater management, and electrical \npower are overused and showing signs of fatigue; economic efficiency is being compromised; and \nenvironmental costs are rising. Small cities and towns represent an underutilized resource in the \nPRC urban system. The average combined annual growth rate of the secondary and tertiary \nsectors in large and medium-sized cities was 14.2% during 2001\u20132005, compared with 5.4% in \nsmall cities and towns. During 1988\u20132002, the gap between public investment per capita in large \nand  medium-sized  cities  versus  small  cities  and  towns  grew  at  an  average  rate  of  2.8%, \ncontributing to a gap in gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which grew at 3.1% annually. While \nmany  cities  and  towns  have  made  significant  investments  in  urban  infrastructure,  few  have \n                                                 \n1  Liaoning Provincial Government. 2005.

Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Town-Based Urbanization Strategy Study. \nManila. ", "2 \ndeveloped  an  integrated  approach  to  urban  development  that  combines  infrastructure \nimprovements with demand-driven pro-poor development, and appropriate town-specific urban \ndesign. Through the development of physical and social infrastructure, small cities and towns can \nattract investment and in-migration from rural areas, thereby playing a more significant role in the \nPRC\u2019s drive to urbanize, increase economic productivity, and distribute the benefits of economic \ngrowth more equitably. Development of small cities and towns aims to attract investment and \ncreate  jobs  to  absorb  rural  migrants.  Increases  in  disposable  income  will  stimulate  domestic \ndemand and economic growth.3 \n \n5.  The revised criteria for an \u201cecologically sound province\u201d and an \u201cecologically sound city and \ncounty\u201d announced by the Ministry of Environmental Protection (then the State Environmental \nProtection  Administration)  on  17  January  2008  give  balanced  emphasis  to  environmental \nprotection and economic development, illustrating the Government\u2019s preference for sustainable \ndevelopment indicators to assess the performance of local governments and officials. The Chinese \nPublic\u2019s Environment and Inhabitant Livelihood Index 20074 shows that Chinese people are most \ndissatisfied  with  air  pollution,  with  25.8%  saying  they  are  very  concerned  with  air  quality. \nAwareness of the adverse effects of the PRC\u2019s unprecedented industrialization is increasing. The \ncountry is now the world\u2019s second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases responsible for climate \nchange; creating negative impacts on biodiversity, livelihoods, and economic development. The \nGovernment  aims  to  integrate  economic  growth,  natural  resource  management,  and  climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation to achieve sustainable development. \n \n6.  The Liaoning Project is one of three small cities and towns development projects supported \nby the Government. The aim is to promote the development of selected small cities and towns in \nthe provinces of Hebei, Liaoning, and Shanxi in a way that can be replicated in other small cities \nand towns in these provinces and elsewhere in the PRC. The three provinces were selected \nfollowing the successful outcome of two ADB-financed TAs: the Town-Based Urbanization Strategy \nStudy (footnote 2) and the Hebei Provincial Development Strategy.5 While the small cities and \ntowns in these provinces face many similar problems and challenges, they also have different \ncharacteristics in terms of geographic location and economy that offer unique opportunities for \npromoting inclusive and sustainable development. Appendix 2 provides a sector and subsector \nanalysis. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Project  Background.  Liaoning  Province,  located  in  the  southern  part  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nnortheast, functions as a hub between the northeastern and the Pan-Bohai economic regions. In \n2007, its total population of 42.98 million comprised mainly Han, with 6.8 million ethnic minorities \n(16% of the total), who are mostly rural residents; those in urban areas are integrated into the Han \nculture. The urban population represented 59% of the total in 2007, and is expected to reach 63% \nby 2010. About 5.6% of the total urban population lived on incomes below the official poverty line, \ncompared with 3.8% nationally.6 Unemployment was 4.4% in 2007, slightly higher than the national \naverage  of  4.0%.  In  Kazuo,  one  of  the  subproject  towns,  unemployment  in  2007  was  33%. \nLiaoning is historically a base for industrial materials and machinery but has faced economic \nchallenges related to an industrial restructuring process of state-owned heavy industries giving way \nto light (e.g., agriculture) and service (including tourism) industries. The aim is to promote balanced \neconomic development and focus on demand-driven growth instead of relying on exports. In 2006, \n                                                 \n3  This is in line with the latest PRC Government incentive to stimulate sustainable growth by increasing domestic \ndemand and decreasing reliance on exports. \n4  Released by the China Environmental Culture Promotion Association in January 2008. \n5  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Hebei Provincial Development Strategy. \nManila. \n6  At  the  end  of  2007,  1.41  million  urban  people  were  living  under  the  minimum  living  guarantee  in  Liaoning;  \n22.71 million in the whole of the PRC (website of Ministry of Civil Affairs of the PRC); Liaoning\u2019s total urban population \nwas 25.44 million; the PRC\u2019s was 593.79 million (website of National Bureau of Statistics of China). \n ", "3 \nthe total losses of Liaoning\u2019s loss-making enterprises amounted to CNY25 billion ($3.7 billion), the \nhighest among all provinces in the PRC.7 About 77% of state industrial firms closed down from \n1996 to 2006. While state investment for fixed assets has aided the industrial transformation since \n2003, the recipients are mostly large cities. While the number of private enterprises, including \nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises increased by 20% during 2003\u20132007, most were established \nin large cities. Small city and town governments have difficulty catalyzing new employment and \neconomic growth. \n \n8.  Small cities and towns in Liaoning Province have made substantial progress in recent years \nin facilitating economic growth. Some resource-based cities and towns have taken advantage of \nthe growth of the mining and metals sectors; and some located within metropolitan areas and \ndevelopment  corridors  have  become  manufacturing  centers,  transportation  hubs,  or \nagroprocessing sites. Others have benefited from multiplier effects through growth in the service \nsector. However, economic development of the counties still lags the big cities. In 2005, per capita \nGDP of all the counties in the province was CNY12,427\u201465% of the provincial GDP and 45% of \nthat  of  large  cities.8 In  addition,  the  government-wide  priority  for  GDP  focused  on  industrial \ndevelopment over service sector growth, limiting the impact of investment in job creation. Also, the \nrapid development and rush to urbanize and industrialize have left many cities and towns with \nsignificant  atmospheric,  aquatic,  and  ground  pollution  and  poor  living  conditions,  threatening \nhuman  health  and  life  expectancy.  The  environments  of  small  cities  and  towns  have  been \nneglected as central and provincial governments have historically focused on larger cities and \nprovincial  capitals,  which  have  financial  capacity.  Thirty-three  percent  of  the  six  major  rivers \nmonitored by the Liaoning provincial government (LPG) in 2005 showed worse than class V COD  \nCr\nstandard and 67% worse than class V NH -N standard,9 indicative of impacts from domestic \n3\nwastewater discharge. In Donggang City, one of the subproject cities, storm water and untreated \nwastewater  flow  into  Dadonggou  River  via  open  channels,  resulting  in  serious  water  quality \ndeterioration and siltation problems that threaten public health. Meanwhile, centralized heating has \nlimited coverage making the use of coal-burning stoves widespread. The major air pollutant in most \ncities is PM ,10 mainly from coal dust during the heating season. Urban population increases have \n10\noutstripped the capacity to provide services, and poor asset maintenance has compounded the \nproblem. Public service providers are unable to manage sustainable operations, and restructuring \nis important to ensure viability and independence. Realigning skills to match the growing demand \nfor labor in secondary industries is also necessary. \n \n9.  As of 2005, 5.37 million people resided in 616 small cities and towns in Liaoning Province \n(footnote 1). While these cities and towns can serve as effective linkages between large cities and \nvillages, and between nonfarming and farming sectors, as well as absorb most of the surplus rural \nworkforce, their development has lagged larger cities. Infrastructure provision in most small cities \nand towns is lacking and outdated. Buildings are generally of low standard. Road density is low, \nand most existing roads are old and of poor quality. Potable water coverage is only 39%. Many \nwater  supply  facilities  are  aged,  network  coverage  is  low,  and  water  production  capability  is \ninadequate. Many drainage pipes and channels, used for 40 or more years, are resulting in severe \nbreakage and blockage. Only a few wastewater treatment plants are operating and no sanitary \nlandfill  is  available  for  domestic  garbage,  which  is  either  disposed  of  in  the  open  or  buried \nunderground, thus polluting water resources. Most garbage collection vehicles are worn out and \ngarbage collection stations are few.11 Continuing urbanization highlights the inadequacy of road \n                                                 \n7  Liaoning Statistics Bureau. 2007.

In addition, \ncities and towns face pollution of surface water and groundwater from garbage, flooding, and \nuntreated wastewater. \n \n10.  In  LPG\u2019s  January  2007  Work  Report,  the  provincial  governor  stated  that  LPG  would \ndevelop county seats and key towns, creating conditions favorable for a strategic shift of the rural \nlabor force. Development of cities and towns would be integrated with economic development of \nthe counties and rural enterprises. Industrial projects and tertiary industries would be concentrated \nin the county seats and key towns to promote prosperity. LPG is bringing about sustainable \ninvestments  in  physical  and  environmental  infrastructure  for  coordinated  and  cost-effective \ndevelopment of small cities and towns. City and town governments are implementing elements of \nthe master plans and investing in roads, water supply, heating, and environmental improvement \nincluding garbage treatment, drainage, and connection of households to the wastewater network. \nThey  need  better  infrastructure  and  municipal  services  to  (i)  attract  investment,  especially  in \nemployment-intensive industries and services; (ii) provide a decent living environment for residents; \nand (iii) extend benefits of growth to all residents. \n \n11.  Project Rationale. The Project is a response to Liaoning\u2019s 11FYP to promote sustainable \neconomic development, particularly in its small cities and towns, via construction and upgrading of \nroad infrastructure and water supply, and environmental improvement. It aims to promote balanced \nand environmentally sustainable urbanization; narrow the urban\u2013rural gap; and improve production, \nemployment, and living conditions in small cities and towns in Liaoning Province. Developing \nmarkets and creating jobs by supporting urbanization and protecting the environment in small cities \nand towns are in line with ADB\u2019s strategic objective of promoting growth with equity in the PRC. All \ncomponents of the Project are integral features in the 11FYP. The core subprojects are Donggang \nCity, Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County, and Linghai City. The availability of viable projects in \nline with approved master plans, the potential to serve as models for subsequent subprojects \nduring sector loan implementation, and the preparedness to undertake investments in municipal \ninfrastructure are some of the considerations in the selection of the core subprojects. Selection of \nsubsequent subprojects will be based, among other factors, on their potential to grow economically \nand provide jobs for rural migrants. Employment growth will contribute more to the Government\u2019s \ngoal of closing the urban\u2013rural income gap than production growth. The subprojects focus on \ntownwide primary and secondary infrastructure, with emphasis on environmental infrastructure. \n \n12.  A key development strategy of Liaoning, called \u201c5 points along one line,\u201d incorporates five \nkey industrial areas along a coastal strip and a new highway that will connect the cities. The \nconcept aims to capitalize on Liaoning\u2019s resources and manufacturing ability to bring new growth. \nDonggang City, a strategically located port city with a harbor near the national border, is an \ninternational trading hub and distribution center within the easternmost \u201cpoint\u201d and will become an \nimportant gateway to attract investment to and drive large-scale development of the poorer eastern \ninterior region of the province. Its development will have a demonstration effect on many similar \nsmall cities also with substantial fishing and agricultural populations. Linghai City is a coastal city \nalong the transport corridor between the northeastern provinces and the Pan-Bohai economic \nregion. It has an agricultural, fisheries, and food crop base, with recent growth in light industries, \nclothing, agroprocessing, and mechanical and electrical equipment manufacturing. It has potential \nto drive the development of a large area. Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County is an inland \ncounty representative of the poor western part of Liaoning. Improved infrastructure will serve poor \nvillages and a growing industrial district that is close to abundant mineral resources and transport \nlines, but presently constrained by water shortage. \n \n13.  Key  issues  in  the  subproject  cities  and  towns  are  (i)  inadequacy  of  infrastructure,  \n(ii) severe air and/or water pollution, (iii) significant share of the population living under the poverty \nline, and (iv) lack of integrated and coordinated planning and management of the development of \nvarious  infrastructure  sectors.  The  Project  will  address  these  issues  through  several  sector \n ", "5 \ninterventions  such  as  support  for  job  creation,  economic  growth,  environmental  protection, \nimprovement of infrastructure, and industrial development. Different cities and towns will promote \ndifferent sectors, depending on their base and their development potential and needs. The main \nsectors are roads and associated municipal services such as (i) street lights; traffic signs, signals, \nand  safety  facilities;  power  and  communication  lines;  and  pipe  network;  \n(ii) water and wastewater; (iii) solid waste management; (iv) upgrading and greening of rivers; and \n(v)  district  heating.  The  subprojects  involve  (i)  construction  of  new  roads  focusing  on  town \nbypasses,  upgrading  inadequate  or  unsurfaced  roads,  and  improving  traffic  planning  and \nmanagement; (ii) increase in the capacity to supply potable water and coverage of distribution \nnetworks,  and  provision  of  sewerage  systems  with  associated  treatment  facilities;  (iii)  river \nimprovement and area upgrading works to reduce the risk of seasonal flooding and increase the \ncapacity  to  impound  water  for  various  uses;  (iv)  provision  of  modern  solid  waste  collection \nequipment, development of engineered waste disposal sites, and strengthening of management of \noperations; and (v) provision of centralized heating plants and associated distribution networks. \nThe Project includes measures to strengthen environmental management in the subproject cities \nand towns. It incorporates approaches and solutions to problems that can be replicated in urban \ncenters throughout Liaoning Province and be demonstrated to other provinces wishing to formulate \nplanning strategies and implement programs to support the structured development of small cities \nand towns. The Project uses a participatory approach, where city and town stakeholders identify \nmajor  urban  problems  and  highlight  actions  to  address  those  problems.  The  subprojects  will \ndirectly support the actions. Supplementary Appendix C provides a sector policy framework. \n \n14.  The  Project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,12 which \nincludes foci on managing the environment, catalyzing investment, and improving governance. \nADB\u2019s  experience  and  knowledge  in  urban  environmental  improvement  and  management, \nincluding support for utility tariff reforms, will add value to the Project, especially in small cities and \ntowns  undergoing  urbanization  and  economic  transformation.  The  Project  conforms  to  ADB\u2019s \nWater  Policy13 and  Water  Financing  Program,14 both  of  which  seek  to  improve  urban  water \ninvestments  through  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  investments  in  water  supply,  sanitation, \nwastewater management, and environmental improvement. It is consistent with ADB\u2019s urban sector \nstrategy, which supports infrastructure investment in settlements that are dynamic engines of \neconomic  growth  and  employment  creation,  innovation,  entrepreneurship,  and  social  services \nprovision. The Project will have a positive impact on the living environment of residents, including \nthe poor, through improved roads and traffic safety and management, water supply, wastewater \ntreatment,  solid  waste  management,  district  heating,  and  river  rehabilitation.  It  also  indirectly \nsupports ADB\u2019s various renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate change initiatives15 by \nimproving  the  transportation  network  and  connectivity,  as  well  as  traffic  management,  thus \nreducing  vehicle  emissions  per  trip,  enhancing  water  resources  management,  and  protecting \ncoastal cities by constructing dikes. \n \n15.  Sector Lending Approach. The Project was formulated in line with the Liaoning 11FYP \nand Liaoning Small City and Town Framework Plan (2003\u20132020), which highlight the promotion of \nsmall  city  and  town  development  to  support  economically,  socially,  and  environmentally \nsustainable urbanization. LPG plans to use the ADB loan to support investment in about seven \nsmall  cities  and  towns  in  the  province.  In  view  of  the  varying  degree  of  preparedness  of \nsubprojects to be included in the Project, and the possibility that some of the subprojects may \nchange during project implementation, the PRC Government agrees that the ADB sector loan \nmodality, which allows for greater flexibility during project implementation, is appropriate. \n \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2008.

The sector loan approach is based on the following: (i) the Government's sector policies, \ndevelopment objectives, and approach to urban infrastructure development and environmental \nmanagement  are  well  formulated;  progress  in  policy  implementation  is  satisfactory,  and  the \nGovernment is continually updating sector policies with ADB support;16 (ii) the sector institutions \nare well developed, and with strengthening and support provided under the Project will have the \ncapacity to implement the sector investment plan; LPG has substantial experience implementing \nsimilar  projects;  and  (iii)  the  sector  investment  plan  and  subprojects  are  well  conceived  and \nappropriately formulated to meet the priority needs of the urban development master plan. LPG \nhas met the conditions and developed subproject identification, selection, and appraisal criteria \nand procedures to ensure that the Project will facilitate achieving the objectives of sector policies \nand plans. Appendix 3 shows the process of subproject identification, selection, preparation, and \nappraisal. Supplementary Appendix B shows the summary appraisal criteria and report template. \n \n17.  Policy  Dialogue.  The  Project  will  build  on  and  further  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  on  \n(i) integrated urban planning and infrastructure development for subregional cities and towns that \nwill  promote  equitable  economic  growth  and  capacity  building;  (ii)  sustainable  environmental \nmanagement; (iii) managerial, technical, and financial sustainability of utility service operations; (iv) \ngovernance and anticorruption; and (v) participatory approach to project design. \n \n18.  The Project will help small city and town governments integrate planning and development \nof subregions on the sectors covered. Efficient and equitable targeting of resources to small cities \nand towns can reduce environmental degradation in large cities, support employment generation, \nand contribute to urban and rural poverty reduction. Most subproject cities and towns have limited \nor no previous involvement in foreign-financed infrastructure projects. Their project management \ncapacity and professional skills for planning and infrastructure delivery are much less developed \ncompared with municipal-level cities. The Project will provide consulting services, training, and \nexposure to best practices in project management and implementation support, urban and traffic \nplanning  and  management,  infrastructure  development,  institutional  improvement,  financial \nmanagement, utility operations, tariff setting, billing, and management of operations with special \nfocus on human resource development. \n \n19.  To  achieve  sustainable  growth,  development  must  be  balanced  with  social  and \nenvironmental concerns. The Project will introduce measures to prevent and control pollution, and \nensure  environmentally  sustainable  growth  through  proper  environmental  planning  and \nmanagement.  It  will  include  training  on  environmental  awareness  and  the  environmental \nmanagement system. Most of Liaoning, in particular the western part, is water scarce. The Project \nwill include programs for both supply- and demand-side water management, including the analysis \nof long-term water balance and planning horizons for domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses; \nwater  conservation  education;  water  source  protection;  pollution  control  and  prevention; \nwastewater reuse; restrictions of groundwater use; and treatment of effluent to an acceptable \ndischarge  standard.  For  the  Donggang,  Linghai,  and  subsequent  subprojects  that  have  road \ncomponents  with  associated  services,  the  Project  will  include  training  on  traffic  and  road \nmanagement, road safety, and wastewater management. \n \n20.  The  implementing  agencies  are  currently  government  agencies,  but  state-owned \nenterprises may assume operations of some of the project facilities. ADB supports corporate \ngovernance reform, namely, (i) structuring enterprises along commercial lines, providing assistance \nin  preparing  business  plans,  and  strengthening  operation  of  the  board  of  directors  and \naccountability  through  supervisory  boards;  (ii)  implementing  external  and  internal  audit \narrangements; and (iii) reforming tariffs to improve cost recovery. The Project will support LPG and \nthe implementing agencies to reform tariffs to reflect a clear policy on cost recovery, and use \n                                                 \n16  ADB has provided TA to the PRC on updating its urbanization policies and strategies. Recent studies include the \nTown-Based Urbanization Strategy Study (TA 4335-PRC, footnote 2) and ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance on the \nStudy on Sustainable Urbanization in Metropolitan Regions. Manila (TA 4702-PRC). \n ", "7 \naccounting systems in accordance with international practice. The water tariff reform program can \nbe  implemented  gradually  to  discourage  wastage,  with  initial  tariffs  to  pay  for  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs,  eventually  reaching  full  cost  recovery.  For  government  agencies \nimplementing nonrevenue-earning components, ADB encourages strengthening the organization \nstructure to improve service delivery; supervision and monitoring, including checks and balances; \nand effective allocation of resources for implementing and operating infrastructure. \n \n21.  ADB is fully committed to good governance, accountability, and transparency. Bidders, \nsuppliers, and contractors must observe the highest ethical standards for the procurement and \nexecution of ADB-financed contracts. Sanctions will apply if fraud and corruption in procurement \nare discovered. Measures are incorporated in the project design in line with ADB\u2019s PRC country \npartnership strategy (2008\u20132010), which includes a goal of promoting good governance through \nsupport for reform and capacity development in corporate governance. LPG and all subproject \ngovernments are recommended to consider involving full-time officials from discipline investigation \nbureaus and audit departments in bidding and construction to enhance construction quality control \nand supervision, and in consultation with relevant central government ministries, updating rules \nand  regulations  on  local  and  corporate  governance,  anticorruption,  and  enhancement  of \ntransparency of the implementing agencies\u2019 operations. \n \n22.  The Project is formulated to take into consideration and incorporate in the project design \ncomments  and  ideas  from  various  levels  of  government,  beneficiaries,  and  affected  people \nincluding vulnerable groups, through stakeholder meetings, focus group discussions, informant \ninterviews, and household surveys. This ensures local participation and involvement in subproject \nidentification and implementation, and O&M of improved infrastructure. A design and monitoring \nframework is created and refined in the process. For future urban projects, the Liaoning project \nmanagement office (PMO) and subproject governments can use the knowledge and experience \nfrom this participatory approach to guide their interventions. \n \n23.  External  Assistance.  Since  1992,  ADB  has  provided  29  loans  totaling  more  than  \n$3.7 billion to the PRC for urban environmental improvement and infrastructure projects, and $57 \nmillion  for  80  TA  studies  to  prepare  these  projects  and  study  key  issues  in  environmental \nimprovement and infrastructure. The Project is based on the Town-Based Urbanization Strategy \nStudy TA, which recommends measures to facilitate development of small cities and towns. ADB \nand the World Bank have provided external assistance for infrastructure development in large and \nmedium-sized cities of Liaoning Province. Appendix 4 provides details of the external assistance. \n \n24.  Lessons. Lessons from ADB and LPG experience in urban development projects include \n(i) strategic master plans play an important role in providing a comprehensive framework for urban \ndevelopment and environmental management; (ii) public awareness and education are important \nfor environmental improvement; therefore public consultation, involvement, and awareness training \non environmental health and protection should be provided; (iii) an effective internal and external \nmonitoring mechanism for resettlement implementation is important for effective coordination and \ntimely implementation of land approval, compensation, and rehabilitation measures. The relevant \nlessons are incorporated in the project design. \n \n25.  Experience in the PRC\u2019s water and wastewater sector indicates that projects are well-\nplanned  and  implemented,  and  tariffs  are  increased  as  required.  Willingness-to-pay  analysis \nindicates that consumers are willing to pay substantially higher prices for water, and to a certain \nextent, wastewater treatment. Issues related to tariffs, cost recovery, and commercial orientation of \nwater  utilities  are  addressed  during  project  preparation.  Lessons  from  previous  projects  are \nreflected  in  the  project  design,  including  (i)  focus  on  institutional  strengthening  to  improve \ncorporate  governance,  (ii)  improved  provincial  coordination,  and  (iii)  financial  and  institutional \narrangements for proper O&M. \n \n ", "8 \n26.  Lessons from ADB and World Bank experience in urban transport projects highlight the \nimportance  of  (i)  comprehensive  and  participatory  approaches  to  project  preparation;  \n(ii)  adequate  consultation  with  those  affected  preceding  a  planned  and  well-coordinated \nresettlement scheme; (iii) professional approach to traffic demand forecasts; (iv) attention to public \ntransport, traffic management, road safety, vehicle emission control, and road maintenance to \ncomplement investment in urban roads; and (v) participation and coordination of all agencies with \nresponsibilities for urban transport. These lessons were considered in the project design. \n \n27.  The  recommendations  of  the  Town-Based  Urbanization  Strategy  Study  TA  were \nincorporated in the project design, especially in subproject selection, namely, (i) town development \nshould  be  conceived  and  implemented  as  part  of  the  development  of  metropolitan  areas, \ndevelopment corridors, and other subregions; and (ii) towns should be targeted for development \nbased on their potential for economic growth and job creation. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n28.  The  impacts  of  the  Project  are  improved  living  conditions  and  increased  employment \ngeneration in small cities and towns in Liaoning Province. The project outcome is improved urban \ninfrastructure and municipal services in about seven small cities and towns in Liaoning.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n29.  The Project includes about seven subproject cities and towns. Detailed assessment and \nanalyses were undertaken for the three core subprojects: (i) Donggang City, (ii) Kazuo Mongolian \nAutonomous  County,  and  (iii)  Linghai  City.  Supplementary  Appendix  D  shows  the  indicative \ncandidate subsequent subprojects. \n \n30.  The Donggang City subproject has three components: (i) roads, bridge, and associated \nmunicipal services; (ii) drainage and wastewater treatment; and (iii) river improvement and area \nupgrading. Component (i) will construct a new trunk road, reconstruct two trunk roads, construct a \nbridge, and install road lights including transformers. Component (ii) will install storm-water pipes \nand wastewater pipes, construct storm-water pumping stations and wastewater pumping stations, \nand install a box culvert. Component (iii) will construct embankment dikes along Dadonggou River \nincluding planting 1.1 million square meters (m2) of landscaped area along the embankment. \nSupplementary Appendix E provides technical details of this subproject. \n \n31.  The Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County subproject has one water supply component \nthat will construct a water intake including a lifting pumping station with 26,000 cubic meters per \nday (m3/d) capacity and a primary sedimentation tank, an intermediate pumping station with a \ncapacity of 26,000 m3/d, and a water treatment plant with a capacity of 25,000 m3/d; and install \nwater  transmission  pipes  and  water  distribution  pipes.  Supplementary  Appendix  F  provides \ntechnical details of this subproject. \n \n32.  The Linghai City subproject has one component for construction and upgrading of roads \nand associated municipal services. It will construct a series of roads (two upgraded trunk roads, \neight upgraded secondary roads, and one upgraded branch road), a water pumping station, and a \nwater storage tank with a volume of 2,000 m3; landscape 150,000 m2 of land along the new and \nupgraded roads; install road lights with transformers, storm-water pipes, and box culverts; lay water \nsupply pipes; and procure road maintenance equipment. Supplementary Appendix G provides \ntechnical details of this subproject. \n \n ", "9 \n33.  The Project also provides for institutional development and capacity-building measures in \nsmall city and town development, municipal infrastructure, and environmental management and \npolicy reforms to ensure sustainability of the Project and related facilities. The Project is the first \nADB sector loan for the Liaoning PMO. The subproject cities and towns have limited experience \nwith internationally funded projects and are not familiar with ADB procedures and international best \npractices, hence training is needed to develop and strengthen institutions that will implement the \nsubprojects and operate the project facilities so they will be sustainable from an operation and \nfinancial perspective. \n \nC.  Special Features \n34.  The development of the Project was directly supported by ADB-financed advisory policy \nand strategy studies. The underlying technical approach for the Project is based on the findings of \na successfully completed advisory TA on town-based urbanization strategy with Liaoning and \nShanxi as case study provinces, a provincial development strategy study for Hebei Province, and \ngovernment policies and plans for small city and town development. These studies highlighted an \nopportunity for ADB to support the PRC\u2019s rural\u2013urban integration policy by strengthening the \ncapacity of small cities and towns to deliver basic urban infrastructure. \n \n35.  The Project supports rural\u2013urban integration in promoting the growth of small cities and \ntowns with various economic functions and infrastructure needs, while incorporating environmental \nand social considerations in planning and development. This will demonstrate to similar cities and \ntowns  in  Liaoning  and  other  provinces  how  they  can  achieve  economically,  socially,  and \nenvironmentally sustainable urban development; as well as achieve greater integration with rural \nareas and large cities. The Liaoning PMO will ensure that lessons identified by project cities and \ntowns are disseminated to nonproject cities and towns through seminars, field visits, promotional \nmaterials,  and/or  the  media.  ADB  will  also  support  dissemination  and  sharing  of  lessons  by \nfinancing  seminars:  (i)  provincial  seminars  to  demonstrate  how  the  advisory  TA  strategy  is \noperationalized  through  the  different  subprojects  and  their  components,  and  (ii)  national  and \ninternational seminars to showcase innovative features in the approach of this sector project and \nthose  in  Shanxi  and  Hebei  in  preparing  and  implementing  sustainable  small  city  and  town \ndevelopment projects. \n \n36.  The ADB Water Financing Partnership Facility will provide a $250,000 grant for this Project \nto  strengthen  financial  and  operating  management  and  corporate  governance  of  water  and \nwastewater agencies and companies in small cities and towns in Liaoning for them to become \ncommercially viable entities.17 Appendix 5 provides a summary of the support and Supplementary \nAppendix H is a brief description of the grant. \n \n37.  The project design follows a planned approach. Identification of long-term planning needs \nand design of the subprojects are based on (i) growth strategies and provincial, city, county, and \ntown  development  master  plans;  and  (ii)  the  principle  of  integrating  provision  of  various \ninfrastructure services to maximize benefits from individual sector improvements. Improved access \nto production factors, inputs, markets, and market information is a driving force of pro-poor growth. \nThe Donggang and Linghai subprojects will upgrade the road network, which carries associated \nservices such as water supply and wastewater pipes; thus extending and improving environmental \ninfrastructure for built-up areas, as well as facilitating pedestrian and cargo transport including job \ncreation for rural residents and for the sale of agricultural produce. \n \n                                                 \n17  ADB is providing TA to the PRC to strengthen urban wastewater and solid waste management, including tariff reform, \nin small cities and towns (ADB. 2007.

Financing Plan \n \n39.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources, to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period \nof 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The \nloan, which will finance 42.3% of the project cost will cover civil works, equipment and supplies, \nproject consulting services and training, and financing charges on the loan during construction. The \nGovernment will finance contingencies. Donggang city government, Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous \ncounty government, and Linghai city government will provide counterpart funding through tax and \nnontax  revenues,  for  which  they  have  provided  commitment  letters.  The  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility will provide a grant of $250,000 to be administered by LPG for supporting \ninstitutional and financial management capacity development of water and wastewater entities. The \nfinancing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2, with details provided in Appendix 6 and \nSupplementary Appendix I. \n \n40.  The PRC is the Borrower of the loan. The PRC Government will relend the loan to LPG.18 \nLPG will then onlend different portions of the loan proceeds to the municipal, city, and county \n                                                 \n18  In loans involving some form of financial intermediation, the term \u201crelend\u201d is used when ADB loans are relent by the \nborrower to one or more intermediaries.

The terms and conditions of the \nloan proceeds transferred within the government system will be the same as those of the ADB loan, \nwith the subproject municipal, city, and county governments concerned bearing the interest and the \nexchange rate variation risk. If the implementing agency for a subproject is a legally registered \ncompany or a separate legal entity, the loan proceeds will be provided to the company or the legal \nentity  under  an  onlending  agreement  between  the  local  government  concerned  and  the \nimplementing agency, based on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan with the \nimplementing agency bearing the interest and exchange rate variation risk.

LPG through the Provincial Project Coordination Group and Liaoning PMO is the Executing \nAgency  for  the  Project.  The  Provincial  Project  Coordination  Group,  comprising  the  Liaoning \nFinance Bureau, Development and Reform Commission, Construction Bureau, Land Resources \nBureau, Audit Bureau, Price Bureau, and Environmental Protection Bureau will provide overall \nguidance, supervision, and support to project preparation and implementation. The Liaoning PMO19 \nwas established to undertake and manage day-to-day project activities, including selection and \nappraisal of subsequent subprojects. In each subproject city and town, a PMO was set up to liaise \nwith the Liaoning PMO and departments and bureaus concerned, and to oversee and manage (i) \nwork  undertaken  by  the  implementing  agency,  (ii)  overall  project  finance,  and  \n(iii) project implementation. Appendix 8 shows the project organization; details of the institutional \narrangement and assessment are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n2.  Subproject Preparation and Appraisal \n42.  In addition to the three core subprojects, additional subprojects will be selected, prepared, \nand appraised during sector project implementation using the following three-stage process. \n \n43.  Subproject Identification and Selection. The subprojects are selected in accordance with \nthe following criteria: (i) confirmation by the local government of its ability and willingness to \narrange counterpart financing and comply with ADB safeguard policies and other requirements;  \n(ii)  confirmation  by  the  concerned  local  government  on  its  willingness  to  comply  with  ADB \nsafeguard policies and other requirements; (iii) implementation of the subproject will be within \n2009\u20132015;  (iv)  eligibility  of  the  components  (roads  and  associated  services,  water  supply, \nwastewater management, river improvement, solid waste management, and district heating); and \n                                                 \n19 The Liaoning PMO is called the Liaoning Urban Construction and Renewal Project Office. \n ", "12 \n(v)  anticipated  positive  impact  on  the  urban  environment,  employment  generation,  economic \ngrowth, and coverage or service level of infrastructure and municipal services. \n \n44.  Subproject Preparation. The participating city or county government and implementing \nagency will, under the guidance of the Liaoning Development and Reform Commission and with \nthe help of the Liaoning PMO, prepare project design documents including a project proposal, \nfeasibility  study,  and  preliminary  engineering  design  for  the  components  of  the  proposed \nsubproject in accordance with the national project investment specifications. The project design \ndocuments will cover subproject rationale; scope; components; technical analysis; cost estimates; \nfinancing plan; implementation arrangements; financial management assessment; and financial, \neconomic, social, and institutional analyses. These documents will be submitted to the Liaoning \nDevelopment and Reform Commission for approval. The participating city or county government \nwill  also  prepare  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  a  resettlement  plan  to  be \nsubmitted to the concerned provincial departments and bureaus for approval. \n \n45.  Subproject Appraisal and Approval. The Liaoning PMO will be responsible for review of \nthe subprojects in accordance with criteria agreed to by the Government and ADB. The subproject \nPMO  will  prepare  a  subproject  appraisal  report,  which  will  follow  the  template  in  the  project \npreparatory TA final report, and submit the appraisal report to the municipal finance bureau for \nreview  and  then  to  the  Liaoning  PMO  for  further  review.  The  Liaoning  PMO  will  submit  the \nsubproject appraisal report to the Liaoning Finance Bureau and Liaoning Development and Reform \nCommission for endorsement before submitting it to ADB for review and approval. \n \n46.  Subsequent subprojects will receive the same extent of environmental safeguard scrutiny, \nmodeled on the EIAs for the three core subprojects and the summary EIA (SEIA). The Liaoning \nPMO will submit the EIAs to ADB for review, after which the revised EIAs will be posted on the \nADB website. An environmental assessment and management framework was prepared to assess \nsubsequent subprojects. For other safeguard concerns, a resettlement framework and an ethnic \nminority development framework were prepared for subsequent subprojects. Draft resettlement \nplans will be prepared using core subproject resettlement plans as models. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n47.  Since this is the first sector project for LPG, selection and appraisal of the initial one or two \nsubsequent subprojects may take additional time to meet ADB and domestic requirements. To \nallow for more flexibility for LPG to select subsequent subprojects to meet the various pace of \ndevelopment of small cities and towns, the Project will be implemented over 6 years from late 2009 \nto late 2015 (Appendix 9). \n \n4.  Procurement and Consulting Services \n48.  Goods, works, and services financed under the loan will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Preliminary  contract \npackages were formulated in consultation with the implementing agencies, and a procurement \ncapacity  assessment  of  LPG,  the  PMOs,  and  the  implementing  agencies  was  undertaken \n(Supplementary Appendix K). Results of the procurement capacity assessment indicate that the \nLiaoning PMO has the capacity and experience to carry out advance procurement. Contracts for \ngoods estimated to cost $1 million or more and contracts for works estimated to cost $10 million or \nmore will be procured using international competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods and \nworks estimated to cost less than these international competitive bidding thresholds but more than \n$100,000 will be procured on the basis of national competitive bidding procedures in accordance \nwith the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law, subject to modifications and clarifications agreed to with \nADB. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost $100,000 or less will be procured using \nshopping  procedures.  Prior  review  will  be  adopted  for  all  international  competitive  bidding \npackages and the first national competitive bidding package. More details of the procurement plan \n ", "13 \nare provided in Appendix 10 and Supplementary Appendix L. \n \n49.  The Project will provide funding for about 154 person-months of international and national \nconsulting services to support the Liaoning and subproject PMOs and implementing agencies in \nproject implementation and management, and institutional capacity building. A consulting firm will \nbe engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) using the standard quality- and cost-based selection method (80% quality and \n20% cost) and simplified technical proposal. The consulting services will cover (i) support of the \nLiaoning  and  subproject  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  in  project  preparation  and \nmanagement including procurement, (ii) development of the project performance management \nsystem  (PPMS),  (iii)  financial  management  including  ADB  disbursement  and  imprest  account \nprocedures, (iv) social and environmental support, (v) O&M, and (vi) institutional strengthening. \nCapacity building for the PMOs and implementing agencies will be achieved through consultant \ninputs; training courses provided by universities, specialized institutes, and firms; in-country and/or \ninternational study visits; and acquisition of additional equipment financed from the loan. To assist \nthe PMOs and implementing agencies in expediting project implementation, another consulting firm \nwill be engaged using the consultants\u2019 qualification selection method to prepare several contracts \nfor advance contracting and design review, and construction supervision for half a year, prior to the \nrecruitment of the consulting firm for the majority of the consulting services. The outline terms of \nreference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n50.  ADB has approved the Government's request for advance contracting for the recruitment of \nconsultants,  training,  and  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works;  and  retroactive  financing  of \neligible expenditures up to $20 million (equivalent to 20% of the ADB loan), incurred before loan \neffectiveness, but not more than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement.20 Advance \ncontracting will include (i) prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid evaluation for civil \nworks packages; (ii) preparation of tender documents to procure materials and equipment; (iii) \nevaluation of bids; and (iv) recruitment of consultants. All advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The issuance of invitations to bid under advance contracting \nand  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The  Government,  LPG,  and  the \nimplementing agencies have been advised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n6.  Governance and Anticorruption Policy \n51.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith LPG, the PMOs, and the implementing agencies. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in \nthe loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. This is in line with ADB\u2019s \nPRC  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u20132010),  which  includes  the  goal  to  promote  good \ngovernance through supporting reform and capacity development in corporate governance. LPG \n                                                 \n20 The advance action on the procurement and recruitment of consultants, and the posting of the general procurement \nnotice on the ADB website, will facilitate the start of the advance action process. ADB Management approved advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing at the Management review meeting on 20 November 2008. \n ", "14 \nhas  indicated  its  commitment  to  fight  corruption  and  a  number  of  anticorruption  actions  are \nincluded as covenants in the loan and project agreements. 21 Under these covenants, LPG will \n \n(i)  involve  the  agencies  responsible for  oversight  of  each  implementing  agency  in \nbidding  and  construction  to  monitor  construction  quality  control  and  supervise \neffective work; \n(ii)  introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract winner also signs \nan anticorruption agreement with the implementing agency; \n(iii)  periodically  inspect  the  contractors\u2019  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements; and \n(iv)  engage the loan implementation consultant to support the Liaoning and subproject \nPMOs and the implementing agencies to ensure good governance, accountability, \nand transparency in project operations. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n52.  The  ADB  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To expedite project implementation through \ntimely release of loan proceeds, the Liaoning Finance Bureau  will establish one imprest account \npromptly after loan effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB.22 This imprest account \nestablished in the provincial finance bureau will be responsible for all withdrawal applications from \nmunicipalities and counties. Disbursements from the imprest account to the implementing agencies \nwill be based on actual expenditures with full supporting documents, which is in line with Ministry of \nFinance internal regulations. Withdrawal applications will demonstrate, among other things, that \nthe goods and/or services were produced in or from ADB members, and are eligible for ADB \nfinancing. The maximum amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed ADB\u2019s \nestimated share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through the imprest account for the \nnext 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditure \nprocedure will be used for liquidation and replenishment of the imprest account and reimbursement \nof eligible expenditures not exceeding $200,000 per individual payment. No withdrawal will be \nmade from the loan account for subprojects in which one or more of the implementing agencies are \nlegally registered companies until the following condition has been met: the Ministry of Finance has \nsubmitted to ADB the certification that (i) the subproject government and the company have \ncompleted an onlending agreement, and (ii) such onlending agreement contains the same financial \nterms and  conditions and other obligations as required in the loan agreement. The Liaoning \nFinance Bureau will set up a separate bank account for the $250,000 grant from the Water \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility  to  be  used  for  engaging  consultants,  and  conducting  training \nprograms and workshops. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n53.  The Liaoning PMO will coordinate with subproject PMOs to prepare semiannual progress \nreports indicating (i) progress made, (ii) problems encountered during the review period, (iii) steps \ntaken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  (iv)  the  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  (v) \nprogress expected in the next 6 months. The implementing agencies will keep records to allow the \nidentification  of  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  following  accounting \nprinciples and practices prescribed by the Accounting Law of the PRC. This law requires that \nfinancial statements generally follow recognized accounting standards. The implementing agencies \nwill set up and maintain separate project accounts and records. The financial statements of the \nproject accounts and the annual corporate financial statements for implementing agencies will be \nsubject to external audit by the audit bureau of the city or county concerned, LPG audit bureau, \n                                                 \n21  In line with ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy (2008\u20132010): People\u2019s Republic of China (footnote 12), which includes \na goal of promoting good governance. \n22  Bank charges on the imprest account will be financed from the ADB loan. \n ", "15 \nand the state audit bureau. The audits will be carried out in accordance with the PRC audit \nregulations and must meet ADB requirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the \nimprest account and statement of expenditure will be part of the audit reports. The implementing \nagencies\u2019 annual audited financial statements and audited project accounts will be submitted to \nADB no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year throughout the implementation period. \nLPG and the implementing agencies will submit reports and information to ADB concerning the use \nof  the  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  and  implementing  agency  performance.  These \nreports will include (i) semiannual progress reports, (ii) annual reports, and (iii) a project completion \nreport not later than 3 months after project completion. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n54.  The PPMS indicators, their relevance, and monitoring practicalities were discussed with the \nLiaoning  and  subproject  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  during  project  preparation.  The \nindicators  are  based  on  the  monitoring  indicators  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework, \nincluding (i) job creation; (ii) service levels; (iii) water supply, wastewater treatment, solid waste \ncollection coverage, and other operating performance measures; (iv) water quality; (v) relevant \nsocial and economic data; (vi) traffic conditions; and (vii) air quality indicators. At the start of project \nimplementation,  the  Liaoning  and  subproject  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies,  with  the \nassistance of the loan implementation consultant, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures \nto generate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of the components, as well as indicators \nto be used to measure project impact. The Liaoning and subproject PMOs will (i) refine the PPMS, \n(ii)  confirm  achievable  targets,  (iii)  finalize  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  (iv) \nestablish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n \n10.  Project Review \n55.  In addition to joint project reviews carried out at least once a year, ADB, LPG, and the \nimplementing agencies will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years after the start of \nproject  implementation.  This  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for \npolicy reform and capacity-building measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n56.  Social Aspects. The poverty and social assessment identifies key areas where the Project \nwill  benefit  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  and  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  removing \ninfrastructure  constraints,  improving  the  condition  of  drinking  water,  addressing  environmental \nconcerns, and promoting sustainable economic growth in seven small cities and towns of Liaoning \nProvince. Provision of water supply in Kazuo will have quantifiable impacts on public health in \nterms of savings made on medical consultations and purchase of medicines (the health impact \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix N). This will also reduce domestic work (largely undertaken \nby women), such as fetching and disposal of water; cleaning; and caring for children, the sick, and \nthe elderly. Women will greatly benefit from improvements in the living environment as they are \nprimarily  responsible  for  household  chores.  Jobs  created  through  the  Project  during  facility \nconstruction  and  operation  will  attract  surplus  rural  labor  to  urban  areas  and  address \nunemployment,  expediting  urbanization,  with the  additional  benefits of  providing  new  skills  to \nworkers and stimulating various secondary industries. Women in the subproject cities and towns \nwill also benefit from future employment due in part to project interventions to stimulate economic \nactivity. A labor reemployment framework is in Supplementary Appendix O. \n \n57.  The Project will benefit 260,000 people residing in the three core subproject cities and \ntowns, as well as residents in four subsequent subproject cities and towns with a total urban \npopulation of about 660,000. Half of the beneficiaries will be women. The percentage of poor \namong the beneficiaries in subproject areas is 9.0% in Kazuo, 4.5% in Linghai, and 3.5% in \n ", "16 \nDonggang.  Key  socioeconomic  impacts  of  core  subprojects  include  (i)  creation  of  jobs  and \nemployment  opportunities;  (ii)  improvement  of  public  health  through  infrastructure  and \nenvironmental improvement; (iii) environmental protection through improvement of the sewage \ncollection system and flood control; (iv) mobility, access, and affordability of key basic services and \ndestinations through road construction; and (v) provision of skills training. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11; details of the poverty and social assessment and \nthe social action plan are in Supplementary Appendix P. \n \n58.  Ethnic minorities in core subproject areas account for 3% of the population and have \nsocioeconomic characteristics similar to those of Han people. Although their culture and language \nare different from the Han\u2019s, they mostly speak Han language and intermarriage with other ethnic \ngroups, particularly the Hans, is common. On the basis of the findings of the socioeconomic \nsurvey, focus group discussions, and consultation in the core subproject areas, an ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan is not needed. In line with the requirement of the sector loan modality, an ethnic \nminority  development  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  Q)  was  prepared  for  subsequent \nsubprojects. \n \n59.  The Project is classified as category A for resettlement. On the basis of project impact \ninvestigation in the feasibility study reports, the Donggang subproject will necessitate relatively \nlarge amounts of land acquisition and resettlement: 25.7 hectares [ha]) of land and 194 households \nor 715 people from seven villages in three towns. A total of 11,174 m2 of structures will be \ndemolished, including 7,645 m2 of residential structures, affecting 91 households or 336 people; \nand 3,529 m2 of nonresidential structures, affecting eight enterprises and 61 shops with 225 \nemployees.  A  full  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  based  on  ADB  procedures.  The  Kazuo \nsubproject will involve permanent land acquisition of 1.5 ha of farmland from three villages, which \nwill  affect  12  households  and  52 people.  During  pipeline  construction,  a  total  7.6  ha  will  be \ntemporarily occupied. No house demolition and relocation is required. Consequently, resettlement \nimpacts are slight and a short resettlement plan for the Kazuo subproject was prepared. The road \nand pumping station component of the Linghai subproject will be constructed either on the existing \nright-of-way or on the land area acquired in 2007. Therefore, only a due diligence report is required \nfor the Linghai subproject. The subproject governments endorsed the resettlement plans, which \nwere  disclosed  to  those  affected  in  mid-October  2008.  The  summary  resettlement  plan  is  in \nAppendix  12.  To  assess  the  resettlement  aspects  of  subsequent  subprojects,  a  resettlement \nframework (Supplementary Appendix R) was prepared. \n \n60.  Financial Aspects. Financial analysis was carried out for the revenue-generating Kazuo \nwater supply component. Financial sustainability analysis was completed for the nonrevenue-\ngenerating  roads  and  river  improvement  components.  Financial  management  assessments \ncomprised LPG and the implementing agencies. A summary financial analysis is in Appendix 13, \nand details are in Supplementary Appendix S. \n \n61.  The financial internal rate of return for the Kazuo water supply component is computed at \n6.1%, comparing favorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 1.2%. The sensitivity \nanalysis confirms that the financial internal rate of return is above the weighted average cost of \ncapital even if costs and revenues change adversely by 10%. \n \n62.  The current water tariffs in Kazuo need to increase gradually to achieve full cost recovery, \ni.e., to cover O&M costs, debt service, and depreciation of proposed facilities. During the first year \nof operation, tariffs in Kazuo will cover 76% of cost; full cost recovery will be achieved after 3 years. \nThe Government has given assurance that tariffs will be increased in phases, taking into account \naffordability factors. \n \n63.  The affordability assessment shows that in Kazuo, water cost as a percent of average \nhousehold income is 1.0%\u20131.2%. Response from the household survey indicates that these rates \nare affordable. The expenditure on utility costs as a percentage of income for the poor is relatively \n ", "17 \nhigher. The Kazuo government provides a subsidy to low-income families through the Minimum \nLiving Standard Scheme and has assured that subsidies to poor families will continue. \n \n64.  Financial  sustainability  of  the  non-revenue-generating  components  was  determined  by \nexamining  O&M  and  debt  service  costs  as  a  percentage  of  local  government  revenues. \nAffordability  was  assessed  by  comparing  identified  financing  sources  with  the  annual  funds \nrequired  for  the  counterpart  portion  of  capital  expenditures  during  project  implementation. \nForecasted debt service and O&M costs for the subproject components were compared as a \npercentage of revenues and found to be 1% or less, indicating acceptable fiscal risk. During the \npeak project implementation period, counterpart funds for all three subprojects will not exceed 5% \nof revenue. Therefore, the non-revenue-generating components are considered both financially \nsustainable and affordable. \n \n65.  The results of the financial management assessment indicate that LPG has an adequate \nfinancial management system and experience in managing projects funded by foreign financial \ninstitutions.  The  three  implementing  agencies  of  the  core  subprojects  operate  as  bureaus  or \ndepartments of the project local governments. Accounting and financial management systems for \nfinancial reporting and accounting are developed and adequate for loan implementation, although \nimprovements to internal control might be required to ensure that separate individuals handle \nauthorization,  recording,  and  custody  of  assets  and/or  transactions.  Audit  arrangements  are \ngenerally  adequate  and  the  implementing  agencies  will  be  required  to  submit  independently \naudited annual financial statements and project accounts to ADB as a loan covenant. The water \nutility  in  Kazuo  will  be  assisted  to  establish  a  reliable  financial  management  system  at  the \nbeginning  of  project  implementation.  It  will  keep  accounts  in  accordance  with  commercial \naccounting principles and be subject to an independent external audit by a suitably qualified firm of \ncommercial auditors. Accounting will be in accordance with relevant PRC standards. A capacity-\nbuilding component to strengthen financial management is included in the Project. Supplementary \nAppendix T provides details of the financial management assessment. \n \n66.  Economic Aspects. The economic analysis for the Project is based on analysis of the \nthree core subprojects, taking into account their socioeconomic indicators and preparedness to \nundertake investments in municipal infrastructure. It covers the (i) economic rationale for public \nintervention, (ii) goals of the investment plans, and (iii) design of the plans. The economic rationale \nis sound as the Project will (i) support Liaoning to promote city and town development in a more \ncoordinated  and  cost-effective  manner,  and  (ii)  bring  about  more  sustainable  investments  in \ninfrastructure that aim to support inclusive economic growth and improve the quality of life. The \neconomic  analysis  also  evaluates  the  components  relative  to  least-cost  analysis  criteria  and \nstandard benefit\u2013cost analysis. The results of the economic analysis indicate that the components \nare economically viable and stand up to sensitivity analyses where costs increase and benefits \ndecrease. The economic internal rate of return for the three core subprojects is 17.7%; and for the \nindividual subprojects: 18.0% for Donggang City, 16.7% for Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County, \nand  18.4%  for  Linghai  City.  A  summary  economic  analysis  is  in  Appendix  14;  the  detailed \neconomic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix U. \n \n67.  Environmental Aspects. The Project is classified as environment category A. Extensive \npublic consultations involving surveys, meetings with stakeholders, and focus-group discussions \nwere undertaken during project preparation. The EIA of the Project is based on the results of the \nEIAs prepared for the three core subprojects, which are representative of the types and nature of \nsubsequent  subprojects.  The  SEIA  was  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  on  \n19 November 2008. An environmental assessment and management framework was developed \nfor subsequent subprojects. \n \n68.  The  Project  supports  climate  change  adaptation  including  (i)  incorporation  of  climate \nchange  issues,  such  as  energy  efficient  measures,  in  urban  master  plans;  \n(ii) comprehensive water management, such as long-term water availability forecasting for new \n ", "18 \ndevelopment  areas  and  adopting  comprehensive  water  balance  measures  during  project \nimplementation;  (iii)  sustainable  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management  including  sludge \ndigestion and biogas extraction; (iv) improved urban roads management and reduced pollution \nfrom cars through improved connectivity and better travel conditions; and (v) promotion of clean \nenergy for more efficient central heating. \n \n69.  The  Project  aims  to  promote  balanced  and  environmentally  sustainable  urbanization; \nnarrow the urban\u2013rural gap; and improve production, employment, and living conditions in small \ncities  and  towns  of  Liaoning  Province.  It  will  have  substantial  environmental,  health,  and \nsocioeconomic benefits. Roads will improve the transportation network and connectivity, thereby \nreducing  travel  time  and  vehicle  emissions  per  trip,  reducing  the  potential  for  increased \ngreenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts. Water supply and wastewater treatment \nwill improve public health and reduce pollutant discharge to rivers and groundwater sources. River \nimprovement, and embankment and landscaping works will provide flood protection, reducing \neconomic loss and public health hazard due to flooding, as well as enhancing wetland habitats. \nThe Project promotes climate change awareness, stimulates internal demand for climate change \ninitiatives, opens discussion for climate adaptation, advances climate change mitigation efforts in \nvarious sectors, and empowers practitioners with user-friendly tools. It provides an opportunity for \nLPG to put in place sound environmental management systems in small cities and towns, and \nestablish adequate institutional capacity in environmental management to ensure sustainability for \nfuture development. \n \n70.  Adverse impacts on the physical and natural environment during the construction and \noperation  phases  of  the  Project  will  be  insignificant  with  good  project  management  and \nimplementation of recommended mitigation measures identified in the environmental management \nplan.  The  plan  includes  institutional  strengthening  for  implementing  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring requirements, and will be continuously developed as the Project progresses to provide \nmore details so that all mitigation requirements are met. \n \n71.  The subsequent subprojects under this sector loan are also required to meet ADB\u2019s EIA \nrequirements.  An  environmental  assessment  and  management  framework,  in  Supplementary \nAppendix V, is prepared as an instruction manual to assist Liaoning PMO, the subproject PMOs, \nthe implementing agencies, and the local design institutes in preparing and reviewing EIA reports \nand  the  environmental  management  plan  for  subsequent  subprojects.  It  describes  the \nenvironmental  criteria  in  subproject  selection  and  implementation,  key  environmental  issues, \nconduct of the EIA, preparation of the EIA reports, and review procedures. Training was provided \nto LPG on implementation of the environmental assessment and management framework. \n \n72.  Project Risks and Mitigation Measures. The Project does not have any unusual technical \nrisks.  Conventional  engineering  designs  with  proven  records  of  reliable  performance  will  be \nadopted for road and bridge construction, installation of municipal services along roads, water \nsupply and wastewater management, river improvement and area upgrading, solid waste treatment, \nenvironmental  sanitation,  heating,  and  landscaping.  During  project  implementation,  the  loan \nimplementation  consultant  will  support  the  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  to  ensure  that \nequipment and works comply with the design requirements and quality assurances. \n \n73.  The following risks could affect timely implementation, economic viability, and realization of \nproject  benefits:  inadequate  preparation  and  late  selection,  appraisal,  and  implementation  of \nsubsequent  subprojects;  failure  to  implement  institutional  strengthening  for  effective  project \nimplementation  and  management,  and  corporate  governance;  lack  of  proper  O&M  of  project \nfacilities; late consultant selection; delay in completion of associated projects; major changes to \nimplementation of the master plans in the subproject cities and towns; delay in the provision of \ncounterpart funding; failure to establish or increase tariffs to meet  cost-recovery targets; and \nunforeseen land acquisition and resettlement issues that hamper efficient implementation of project \nworks and restoration of livelihoods of those affected. \n ", "19 \n74.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  through  effective  institutional  arrangements  and  project \nmanagement, as well as extensive and appropriate training on ADB and domestic procedures and \nrequirements, provision of institutional capacity building (including the grant provided by the Water \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility),  and  appropriate  project  implementation  and  monitoring \narrangements for the subproject city and town PMOs and implementing agencies with support of the \nloan implementation consultant and a consulting firm engaged early in the Project, synchronization \nof the project design and implementation schedules with associated projects planned, covenanted \nassurances from the subproject city and town governments on the provision of counterpart funding \nand on regular tariff reviews and increases, strengthening of the internal monitoring and supervision \nby LPG and subproject PMOs and implementing agencies, and engagement of a qualified external \nagency to monitor and evaluate resettlement. LPG and the subproject governments demonstrate \nhigh ownership in preparing and committing to implement the Project. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n75.

Development of Small Cities and Towns  \n \n1.  The People\u2019s Republic of China. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has long \npromoted the development of small cities1 and towns as a way to achieve a more balanced \nurban system. It has been wary that large-scale migration from the countryside would lower the \nproductivity of the fledgling urban economy and undermine industrial growth, and so curbed \nmigration for many years through the hukou (household registration) system and promoted the \ndevelopment of small cities and towns as alternative destinations for rural migrants. Waves of \nmigration into urban areas since the 1980s have contributed to a steep rise of urbanization in \nthe country over the last 30 years. In 2006, about 44% of the national population lived in urban \nareas, up from 18% in 1978. The results of the development policy since the mid-1990s have \nbeen uneven. While almost all provincial governments have success stories, most of the growth \nof cities and towns has taken place in the eastern and southern regions of the country, where \nthe  rise  of  export-oriented  manufacturing  has  benefitted  settlements  of  all  sizes.  While \ngovernment policies have been instrumental in building the linkages between town-based and \ncity-based firms, national macroeconomic and trade policies have contributed as much to small \ncity  and  town  development  in  coastal  regions  as  urbanization  policy.  The  relative  lack  of \ndevelopment  in  small  cities  and  towns  in  western,  northern,  and  some  central  provinces \nprovides evidence of this. \n \n2.  The 11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP) 2006\u20132010 takes advantage of the potential of small \ncities and towns to increase national economic productivity, while narrowing the urban income \ngap, thereby contributing to social stability. It calls for strengthening the physical and economic \nlinkages between major cities in metropolitan areas or major development corridors, and the \nsmall cities and towns at their periphery. Continuity with previous policy is achieved through an \nexplicit priority on migration to small cities and towns rather than to the megacities. Consistent \nwith  the  PRC\u2019s  emphasis  on  \u201charmonious  development,\u201d  the  plan  also  calls  for  equitable \ndistribution of the benefits of urban development. \n \n3.  Liaoning Province. Many small cities and towns in Liaoning recently have experienced \nrapid  development  but  now  face  challenges  similar  to  those  of  other  northern  Chinese \nprovinces. Rapid growth has resulted in environmental pollution and/or worsening of living \nconditions; the inadequacy of infrastructure provisions has constrained growth. The provision of \nemployment for the current citizens and migrants from the rural and less-developed areas is a \ngreat  challenge,  and  necessitates  substantial  investment,  usually  overstretching  limited \nfinances. \n \n4.  Most of the small cities and towns in the province have a relatively low population, \naveraging about 9,000, and cannot serve as effective linkage between large and medium-sized \ncities and the rural areas, or absorb most of the surplus rural workforce. Regional disparity is \napparent as most of the 15 poor counties are in the western part. To provide role models for \nsustainable growth of small cities and towns, employment generation, and improved living \nstandards,  the  Liaoning  Small  City  and  Town  Framework  Plan  (2003\u20132020)  stresses  the \ndevelopment of cities and towns along major transport routes, especially near major cities that \nhave the ability to spur the development of surrounding areas, while helping less-developed \nareas.  The  Liaoning  11FYP  calls  for  strengthened  construction  of  small  cities  and  towns, \nplanned expansion of the built-up area of county-level cities, and focused development of \nindustrial districts in counties to boost urbanization. The Liaoning Province Committee of the \nChinese  Communist  Party  issued  Circular  Number  [2006]  9,  which  recommends  ways  to \nexpedite county-level economic development, such as developing industries producing spare \n                                                 \n1  Small cities in the PRC are generally considered to have populations in the 100,000\u2013250,000 range. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nparts, promoting tertiary industries, expediting growth of county seats and key towns, and giving \nmore assistance to underdeveloped counties. \n \n5.  Based on these, all the three core subprojects chosen for this Project are along major \ntransport corridors, have employment generation potential, and have attained a certain level of \ndevelopment. The loan will offer Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County, from the poorer and \ndrier western part, the opportunity to develop environmentally sustainable infrastructure that will \nenable investments in natural resource processing, manufacturing, and services. The cities of \nDonggang located on the eastern coast and Linghai on the central coast have achieved high \ngrowth rates, and can improve living conditions and the environment by investing in urban \nenvironmental infrastructure financed by the loan. \n \n6.  The Project involves several levels of government intervention. The Liaoning provincial \ngovernment is promoting development in multiple cities and towns across the province in a \nmore coordinated and cost-effective manner. It is uniquely positioned to achieve demonstration \neffects  of  the  subprojects  by  sharing  success  stories,  development  approaches,  and \nimplementation mechanisms with other small cities and towns across the province. The city and \ncounty governments are implementing their master plans through capital investment in roads, \nwater supply, wastewater, solid waste management, and district heating works; and will own \nand manage most of the completed facilities. \n \n7.  The national and Liaoning provincial policies on small cities and towns, in line with the \nrecommendations in the Asian Development Bank-funded Town-Based Urbanization Strategy \nStudy in Liaoning and Shanxi provinces, form the basis of the Project.2 Poor small cities and \ntowns in Liaoning need to develop their infrastructure to attract investment in natural resource \nprocessing, manufacturing, and services. Others that have achieved high growth require better \ninfrastructure to improve living conditions and protect the environment. \n \nB.  Roads and Associated Services \n \n8.  The 11FYP calls for reduction of the economic distance to markets, linkage of the \nwestern and eastern provinces, and integration of rural areas into national transport networks. \nGovernments  of  high-growth  small  cities  and  towns  are  challenged  to  provide  roads  and \nassociated  services  to  accommodate  the  need  for  industrial,  commercial,  and  residential \ndevelopment. In most cases they must build the roads themselves to establish the physical \nframework to attract investment in industry, and commerce and provide decent housing to \ncurrent and future residents, essential for their future growth. \n \n9.  Due  to  the  rapid  growth  of  Liaoning  and  resulting  increase  in  traffic  volume,  the \nComprehensive Transport Plan of Liaoning Province, put forward in Liaoning City and Town \nSystem Planning (2003\u20132020), was used as the basis for the road sector analysis. The traffic \nplan associated with the Liaoning 11FYP set high investment targets for land and sea transport \ninfrastructure, and related technological and service improvements. Targets include that by \n2010, every county will be connected to an expressway and every village connected to a paved \nroad and provided with public passenger transport. A network of ring and radial types of major \nexpressways across the province and connected to major ports and other provinces will be \ncompleted. Outdated roads in county-level cities and above will be reconstructed. The road \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Town-Based Urbanization Strategy \nStudy. Manila. The study concludes that the overarching factor should not be growth of production, but rather \ngrowth of employment that will contribute more to the Government\u2019s goal of closing the rural\u2013urban income gap. \nThe  study  recommended  growing  both  cities  and  towns  by  facilitating  the  development  of  larger  urban \nagglomerations made up of different types of urban settlements and proposed that key towns should be selected \nbased on their \u201cemployment rate of return,\u201d i.e., the number of jobs created per yuan invested by government. \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \ncomponents of the Donggang and Linghai subprojects will improve accessibility of individual \nareas and enable extension of municipal services to existing and proposed premises, thus \nenhancing  living  standards.  This  will  upgrade  inadequate  and  outdated  infrastructure  for \nresidents and the markets; and serve future residential, commercial, and office uses. This will \nstrengthen the economy, improve the physical and business environment, and support urban \narea trade with rural areas and other cities. \n \n10.  Donggang City is a seaport in southeastern Liaoning, facing the Yellow Sea to the south. \nIt is the northern starting point of the PRC\u2019s coastline, with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea across Yalu River to the southeast. With an important harbor near the border, it is being \ndeveloped as a distribution center for many agricultural, aquatic, and industrial products outside \nthe province; the subproject road component will promote this development. A new trunk road \nwill link existing roads to form a loop around the city center. Upgrading of two existing trunk \nroads and a secondary road with associated drainage and wastewater pipes and lighting, as \nwell as construction of a bridge, is included in the component. The bridge, located on the West \nRing Road across the Dadonggou, the main river crossing the city and draining to the Yellow \nSea, will link major districts of the city. The upgraded roads will improve the traffic condition and \nfacilitate public transport. More products are expected to pass through the city upon subproject \ncompletion, generating employment and developing markets for agricultural products near and \nfar, which will particularly benefit those engaged in agricultural production. Capacity building in \nurban  planning  and  traffic  engineering  will  improve  the  authorities\u2019  traffic  management \ncapability. \n \n11.  Linghai City is a coastal city on Liaodong Bay in Bohai. It has four markets: one for \nagricultural products, one for spare parts for cars, and the other two for daily necessities where \nwomen are major traders. Many roads in the built-up area have outdated services, lack proper \ndrainage  and  lighting,  and  are  not  served  by  public  transport.  The  subproject  component \nincludes the upgrading of two trunk roads, eight secondary roads, and a branch road, with \nassociated water supply and drainage pipes and lighting. This will improve living standards, \nfacilitate  traffic  flow,  promote  economic  growth,  and  improve  road  safety.  Public  transport \nservices will be introduced in the areas served. \n \nC.  Water Supply, Drainage, and Wastewater \n \n12.  Rapid urbanization in the PRC, including development of small cities and towns, has \nexacerbated  water  resource  depletion  and  deterioration  of  the  water  environment.  Water \nshortage due to pollution of water sources is a key reason for the inadequacy of potable water. \nThis threatens the drinking water safety of urban and rural residents. In view  of this, the \nGovernment is making efforts to promote centralized water supply facilities to minimize safety \nproblems of scattered water sources, and encourages construction of centralized municipal \nwastewater treatment plants. Nevertheless, municipal wastewater in most small cities and towns \nis not effectively collected due to inadequate municipal sewer networks. Construction of water \nsupply and wastewater treatment facilities requires substantial funding, which brings financial \npressure to the small city and town governments. \n \n13.  Liaoning Province\u2019s water resources are scarce: only 800 cubic meters per capita, 1/3 of \nthe national average. The potable water coverage is only 39%. Many water supply facilities are \nold, network coverage is low, and production capability of the water sources is inadequate. \nMany drainage pipes and channels have been used for 40 years, some for 100 years; breakage \nand blockage are serious. In rural areas, some of the underground water sources contain high \nfluorine content, taste bitter, and are unhygienic. \n \n14.  Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County is poor but recently has expedited growth in its \nGongyingzi New District with investment from a number of industrial enterprises that employ \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nmany workers. However, water shortage constrains development: the capacity and coverage of \nthe water supply system is too low, and too many individual wells do not favor the unified \nmanagement and scheduling of water supply. An environmentally sustainable water source is a \nriver basin at Nanliangzi village, 18 kilometers from the new district. The proposed water supply \ncomponent includes water intake works at the water source, water transmission pipes, an \nintermediate  pumping  station,  a  water  treatment  plant,  and  water  distribution  pipes.  It  will \nimprove the infrastructure to previously unserved villages where the rate of poverty is high, and \nserve  as  a  growth  engine  creating  employment  opportunities  for  the  surplus  labor  and \nexpediting development in the new district. \n \n15.  The present water supply and drainage networks of Donggang and Linghai cities are \noutdated, density of the pipe network is low, and standards of design and construction are poor. \nTo improve living standards and the urban environment, storm-water and wastewater pipes, \npumping stations, and a box culvert are included in the Donggang subproject; and water supply \npipes, a reservoir, a pumping station, storm-water pipes, and a box culvert are included in the \nLinghai subproject. \n \nD.  River Improvement \n \n16.  Rivers in the PRC are seasonal\u2014about 70% of annual rainfall occurs from June to \nSeptember in most areas\u2014and the channel beds are often littered with solid waste, filled with \nsediment, and polluted by untreated wastewater. River improvement projects aim to reshape the \nriver channels; install embankments; and landscape riverbanks with walkways, trees, shrubs, \nand vegetation, providing flood control as well as a scenic urban park. \n \n17.  Dadonggou River is a key part of the flood prevention and tidal protection system of \nDonggang City, and an important passage for urban drainage and fishing and freight ships \ngoing out to the Yellow Sea. The local government has been endeavoring to improve the river \nand its banks for decades. From 1936 to 1998, 19 large-scale floods, 9 gales with a wind scale \nof 9 or above, astronomical tides, and basinwide rainstorms threatened life and property. The \n2.4 kilometer (km) long embankment dikes included in the Donggang subproject are on the right \nbank of the Dadonggou, and will reinforce and connect to the existing embankment. The design \nstandard adopted for flood and tidal protection will be for a return period of 50 years, up from 5 \nyears  at  present.  In  addition,  1.1  square  kilometers  (km2)  along  the  riverbank  will  be \nlandscaped,  with  some  recreational  facilities  added  for  the  general  public.  The  river \nrehabilitation and dredging, riverside renewal, and area upgrading works will provide a cleaner \nenvironment for residents, alleviate flooding damage, help realize the comprehensive benefits of \nall the works on the Dadonggou, and contribute to the sustainable development of Donggang \nCity. \n \nE.  Waste Management and Sanitation \n \n18.  While the core subprojects do not include any solid waste management or environmental \nsanitation components, these elements are included in some of the subsequent subprojects. \nNone of the small cities and towns in Liaoning have a sanitary landfill for domestic garbage, all \nof which is disposed in the open or buried in a simple manner, polluting water resources. Most \ngarbage collection vehicles are seriously worn, and there are few garbage collection stations. \nFor proper waste management and sanitation, waste collection and disposal facilities should be \nconstructed  and/or  procured,  including  sanitary  landfills,  public  toilets,  garbage  collection \nstations, dustbins, and garbage collection vehicles. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  29 \nPROCESS OF SUBPROJECT IDENTIFICATION, SELECTION, PREPARATION, AND \nAPPRAISAL \n \n1.  Under  the  sector  loan  approach,  the  Liaoning  provincial  government  (LPG),  the \nExecuting Agency, has established a three-stage approach for identifying, selecting, preparing, \nand  appraising  subprojects  for  inclusion  in  the  Project.  These  procedures  will  be  used  to \nappraise subsequent subprojects, and identify and select additional subprojects needed to \nensure full utilization of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan. LPG has delegated various \nactions and decisions to the Liaoning project management office (PMO). \n \nA.  Stage 1: Subproject Identification and Selection \n \n2.  LPG  has  invited  county-level  city  and  county  governments  in  Liaoning  Province  to \nexpress their interest in participating in the Project to be partly financed by the ADB loan. In \nissuing this invitation, LPG refers to basic selection criteria: \n \n(i)  The subproject must be in the urban development sector, i.e., related to the \nphysical development of small cities and towns, with particular emphasis on \ninfrastructure development. The eligible subsectors for subproject investment are \nroads and associated municipal services, water supply, wastewater management, \nriver improvement, area upgrading, solid waste management, district heating, \nand education. \n(ii)  The subproject must be a county-level city or county or a town. \n(iii)  A master plan supports the subproject. \n(iv)  The subproject must improve environmental quality and/or enable employment \ngeneration, as follows: \n(a)  Improve environmental quality by accomplishing one of the following:  \n(1)  rehabilitate  polluted  areas  in  the  subproject  city  and  town;  \n(2) lower the rate of (or slow the rate of) pollution of water, land, and/or \nair in urban areas; (3) treat solid waste or wastewater prior to discharge \ninto  the  natural  environment;  and/or  (4)  increase  environmental \nsustainability of the subproject city and town development through more \necologically sensitive settlement patterns or infrastructure services. \n(b)  Increase employment generation by accomplishing one of the following: \n(1) facilitate investment in labor-intensive economic sectors including the \nservice  sector;  (2)  remove  a  specific  infrastructure-related  barrier  to \ngrowth of an economic sector in the subproject city and town (that is, \nenable  economic  growth  through  provision  of  infrastructure  service);  \n(3) enable the development of residential areas for employees of new or \nexpanding businesses (i.e., providing roads and associated municipal \nservices  for  urban  expansion  areas);  (4)  strengthen  linkages  of  the \nsubproject city and town economy with the metropolitan or subregional \neconomy (including growth corridors and clusters); and/or (5) increase \naccess of the urban poor to economic opportunities. \n(v)  The  local  government  must  confirm  its  ability  and  willingness  to  arrange \ncounterpart financing. \n(vi)  The local government must confirm its willingness for the subproject to comply \nwith ADB safeguard policies and other requirements. \n(vii)  Implementation must be during 2009\u20132015. \n \nB.  Stage 2: Subproject Preparation \n \n3.  Preparation  by  local  governments  involves  designating  an  implementing  agency  (or \ninitially an office of the government) to prepare project design documents including a project \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nproposal and feasibility study report under the guidance of the Liaoning Development and \nReform Commission (LDRC); with the help of the Liaoning PMO, an environmental impact \nassessment, and (if required) a resettlement plan to standards necessary to meet both domestic \nand ADB requirements. Governments must also determine suitable institutional arrangements \nfor project implementation and prepare a detailed financing plan. \n \n4.  Local  design  and  other  specialist  institutes  (locally  appointed)  will  support  local \ngovernments in their work and compliance with ADB requirements. \n \n5.  To facilitate an orderly and consistent appraisal of the subprojects, the Liaoning PMO \nrequires a subproject appraisal report in a common format to be prepared (to ADB standards) \nfor each proposed subproject, including technical, social, resettlement, financial, economic, \ninstitutional, and environmental analysis. \n \nC.  Stage 3: Subproject Appraisal and Approval \n \n6.  The ADB project team has developed a detailed set of evaluation criteria, which was \ndiscussed  and  agreed  with  LPG.  This  is  to  ensure  that  individual  subproject  appraisal  is \nconducted in accordance with ADB standards. The appraisal of the three core subprojects will \nalso serve as guidance for the appraisal of subsequent subprojects. \n \n7.  Each subsequent subproject PMO will prepare a subproject appraisal report, which will \nfollow the template provided in Supplementary Appendix B (which also shows the summary \nappraisal criteria), and submit it to the municipal finance bureau for review and then to the \nLiaoning PMO for review. The Liaoning PMO will submit the appraisal report to the Liaoning \nFinance Bureau and LDRC for endorsement. \n \n8.  Rejected  subprojects  are  to  be  referred  to  the  relevant  local  governments  with \nindications of where the preparations and proposals are deficient, and for additional preparation \nwork (assuming the subprojects have a realistic chance of meeting the agreed evaluation \ncriteria). \n \n9.  Subprojects approved by LDRC will be forwarded to ADB for approval. \n \n10.  All subproject approvals by ADB or LPG will only be made if \n \n(i)  the subproject includes an environmental impact assessment which has been \nendorsed by the Liaoning Environmental Protection Bureau and ADB, and has \nbeen subject to relevant public consultation and disclosure; and \n(ii)  a  resettlement  plan,  meeting  ADB  requirements,  has  been  prepared  and \napproved by the relevant local government, and endorsed as satisfactory by ADB. \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  31 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nTable A4.1: Asian Development Bank Assistance for Infrastructure and Environmental \nImprovement in the People\u2019s Republic of China \nDate of  Amount \nNo.  Name \nApproval  ($ million) \nA.

Objectives \n \n1.  To enhance the sustainability of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed water \nsupply and wastewater infrastructure, ADB will provide a grant to strengthen the institutional and \nfinancial  management  capacity  of  entities  involved  in  planning,  financing,  implementing, \noperating, and maintaining water and wastewater systems in the subproject small cities and \ntowns. This includes water supply and wastewater service providers participating in both core \nand subsequent subprojects. The assistance, to be administered by the Liaoning provincial \ngovernment, will also focus on improving the provincial policy and regulatory framework for \nthese providers and, where appropriate, the national policy and regulatory framework. \n \n2.  The capacity-building assistance will improve the ability of water and wastewater service \nproviders to respond to ongoing urbanization challenges by enhancing their ability to deliver \nsustainable services. Specifically it will \n \n(i)  help the participating entities develop a comprehensive corporate strategy to \nwater  and  wastewater  service  provision  in  which  organization  structures, \npersonnel, and systems and procedures are aligned with corporate goals and \nobjectives; \n(ii)  adopt a demand-driven approach for service delivery, in which service levels and \ncoverage  for  water  and  wastewater  are  set,  and  interventions  designed  in \nresponse to the expressed priorities and preferences of end users; and \n(iii)  strengthen financial management and cost recovery so that revenues cover costs \nto the extent possible and the service provider is able to meet its substantial \nfinancial obligations in an environment of rapidly expanding service provision. \n \nB.  Scope of Work \n \n3.  The team implementing the capacity-building assistance will assess the institutional and \nfinancial  capacity  of  the  designated  service  providers,  formulate  a  program  to  strengthen \ninstitutional  capacity  (including  training,  assistance  with  corporate  reform,  improvement  of \nadministrative  systems  and  procedures,  and  design  of  pilot  interventions),  and  assist  with \nimplementing  the  program.  The  team  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  provincial  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  and  work  closely  with  the  subproject  PMOs  and  implementing \nagencies.  The  Executing  Agency  will  be  responsible  for  administration  of  the  grant  and \nrecruitment of consultants. \n \nC.  Period of Performance \n \n4.  The work will be carried out over 12 months commencing in early 2010. \n \nD.  Staffing \n \nInternational consultants will comprise an operations and institutional specialist, and a financial \nmanagement specialist. National consultants will comprise a financial specialist, an operations \nand institutional specialist, a water and wastewater pricing specialist, a training specialist, and a \ncustomer outreach specialist. \n \n \n ", " \nSUMMARY COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A6.1: Summary Cost Estimates \nCNY Million  $ Million \nPercentage \nForeign  Local  Foreign  Local \nItem  Total  Total  of Total \nExchange  Currency  Exchange  Currency \nCosts  Costs  Costs \nCosts  Costs  Costs  Costs \nA.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nThe Project\u2019s objectives are to promote balanced and environmentally sustainable urbanization; narrow the urban\u2013\nrural gap; and improve production, employment, and living conditions in small cities and towns in Liaoning Province. \nAlthough the Project will not reduce poverty directly, it will contribute to achieving short- and long-term poverty \nreduction impacts. The Project is in line with the PRC\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy for development of the \nnortheastern region, which aims to decrease the income gap between urban and rural residents, and supports \nLiaoning\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) 2006\u20132010 to promote sustainable economic development, particularly in small \ncities and towns, via improvements to environmental and transport infrastructure. All project components are integral \ncomponents of the 11FYP. The Project is consistent with Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy to increase access \nto safe and reliable water supplies, and will help the PRC achieve the Millennium Development Goal 7 (environmental \nsustainability) and target 10 (to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and \nbasic sanitation by 2015). The Project adheres to ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy in the PRCa to make markets \nwork more efficiently through (i) urban infrastructure development, (ii) promotion of environmental sustainability, and \n(iii) pro-poor equitable and inclusive growth. \n \nSmall cities and towns in Liaoning have made substantial progress in recent years in facilitating economic growth. \nHowever, the government-wide priority on gross domestic product growth has supported industrial development more \nthan service sector growth. This has limited the impact of investments on job creation and ultimately poverty \nreduction. The Project aims to help promote balanced and environmentally sustainable urbanization, narrow the \nurban\u2013rural gap, improve production, generate employment, and improve living conditions. The Project will contribute \nto achieving short- and long-term impacts by removing infrastructure constraints, improving access to and quality of \npotable water, reducing health risks from waterborne diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability, and promoting \nsustainable economic growth in seven small cities and towns of Liaoning Province. The Project will benefit 260,000 \nresidents in the three core subproject cities and towns of Donggang, Kazuo, and Linghai; and 660,000 residents in \napproximately four subsequent subproject cities and towns. \n \nWith the infrastructure improvements, Kazuo will be able to attract more industrial investors and promote local \nemployment opportunities. In Linghai, the mobility of people and products will be enhanced through better and safer \ntransportation networks. Donggang\u2019s position as an importer\u2013exporter will be strengthened by improved roads and \nother improvements. The Project will contribute to poverty reduction by reducing the incidence of waterborne \ndiseases and flood risk in small cities and towns, providing employment opportunities during construction and \noperation  of  project  facilities,  with  anticipated  flow-on  effects  on  social  and  economic  development.  Specific \nanticipated benefits include the following: \n \n(i)  Job creation. Construction of works under the three core subprojects will directly generate 580,000 work-\ndays of new employment and indirectly generate an additional 930,000 work-days through a multiplier \neffect. Seventy percent of construction jobs will be unskilled. Operation of the works created by the three \ncore subprojects is expected to generate about 2,800 full-time jobs directly and 4,520 full-time through \nmultiplier effects each year. The loan assurances specifically address employment of the poor, women, and \nethnic minorities, which will contribute to narrowing the income gap and reducing poverty. \n(ii)  Improved public health. The three core subprojects will reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases \narising from contamination of water, associated increases in medical expenses (estimated to be CNY287 \nper capita annually), and time lost from work leading to a loss of income (estimated to be CNY220 per \ncapita annually). For the detailed health impact analysis, see Supplementary Appendix N. \n(iii)  Environmental protection. Improvement of sewerage systems and flood control will protect the local \nenvironment and promote sustainable growth. Introduction of the public education and awareness program \n(PEAP) will help ensure the success and sustainability of project improvements and their impact on \npeople\u2019s lives. \n(iv)  Improved quality of life. Road construction will facilitate mobility, access, and affordability of key basic \nservices. Water and sanitation improvements will improve health and significantly reduce time burdens, \nparticularly for women. The PEAP and community monitoring teams will enhance awareness and promote \naccountability of local basic services. \n ", "46  Appendix 11 \n(v)  Skills training. The subprojects will include skills training in collaboration with other stakeholders, and \nthrough the resettlement plans. Vulnerable groups are prioritized for skills training in the loan assurances. \n \nEnvironmental and socioeconomic benefits will accrue to the local populations; benefits will be felt especially by the \npoor who are most vulnerable to environment-related diseases and poor urban environments. For subsequent \nsubprojects, a poverty reduction and social strategy will be prepared as part of the subproject appraisal report \n(Supplementary Appendix B). \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention  \n(Nonincome Millennium Development \nGoal) \n1. Key Issues \nLiaoning Province is located in the northeastern part of the PRC. In 2007, 5.6% of the total urban population was \nliving below the official poverty line, compared with 3.8% nationally. Five of 27 cities and counties in Liaoning are \nclassified  as  poor.  The  province  is  identified  in  the  PRC  national  development  strategies  as  geographically \ndisadvantaged with higher urban poverty than other regions, requiring special efforts through prioritized allocation of \nresources. \n \nWithin Liaoning Province, poverty rates vary among the subproject cities and towns. Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous \nCounty, one of the provincial key poverty reduction counties, has a high incidence of poverty, with 16.5% of the urban \npopulation and 10.4% of the rural poor population living under minimum guaranteed living. In Donggang City the \nurban poverty rate is 2.6% and the rural rate is 4.1%; in Linghai City the urban poverty rate is 4%, and rural rate \n7.3%. The unemployment rate in Kazuo is 33%, in Donggang 4.3%, and in Linghai 4.4%; these are all higher than the \nnational target of \u201cunder 4%\u201d called for in the 11FYP. \n \nUnemployment, limited income sources, and subsequently poverty are major issues in all of the subproject areas. \nThe focus group discussions and stakeholder analyses reveal that the major causes of poverty in the subproject \nareas are lack of employment opportunities, limited skills to create income, inadequate alternative income generation \nsources,  poor  infrastructure,  and  exposure  to  waterborne  diseases.  Details  are  available  in  Supplementary \nAppendix P, the poverty and social assessment and social action plan. \n \n2. Design Features \nThe project design attempts to address social and poverty dimensions of the subprojects by (i) reducing impacts on \nland acquisition and resettlement; (ii) encouraging employment of local labor, especially the poor and women; and \n(iii) employing participation strategies such as a community-based PEAP, community monitoring teams during \nimplementation, and community management committees during operation of the new infrastructure. The social \naction plan outlines strategies for mitigating adverse impacts and promoting positive benefits such as employment, \nskills training, and awareness-raising. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Findings of Social Analysis \nA socioeconomic survey was undertaken with a sample of 518 randomly selected households and interviews with \n1,689 people. In addition, 17 focus group discussions involving 131 people were conducted. The poverty and social \nanalysis identifies vulnerable groups and opportunities for pro-poor interventions, and recommends social action \nmeasures, participation, and mitigation plans to achieve positive social benefits. The analysis indicates that with \nrapid urbanization, development challenges for the province include inadequate public services, groundwater \npollution, and insufficient urban transport networks. The Project aims to address these issues and meet the \ndemands of residents by improving water supply, river management, and roads and associated municipal services. \nThe main findings of the social analysis for three core subprojects are as follows. \n \nThe project components meet the beneficiaries\u2019 urgent needs. Currently the coverage rate of piped water supply in \nthe Kazuo subproject area is 32% and in Linghai 50%; unconnected households generally use well water. Water from \nsome wells in Kazuo contains bacteria and a high content of fluorine, leading to dental fluorosis, especially among \nchildren, and high rates of diarrhea. Water service quality in Linghai is limited by extensive leakage from the \ndistribution network and inadequate pressure to serve multistory apartment buildings. Despite living in apartments, \nresidents spend a lot of time collecting water. Many residents in the Donggang and Linghai subproject areas, lacking \naccess to sewerage or drainage systems, dispose of untreated wastewater directly into their yards or the street, \nthereby polluting the local living environment and groundwater supplies. Floods occasionally occur in Donggang, \ncausing flood damage to property and undermining local environmental quality. The transport network in Linghai is \ncharacterized by insufficient traffic management facilities and measures for pedestrians and nonmotorized transport \nusers. \n \nThe components included in each subproject  were identified through the household survey and focus group \ndiscussions as the top priorities of local residents and stakeholders. The Project will provide tap water for 89,000 \npeople and wastewater collection for 84,000, and improve transport conditions and flood control for 84,000 residents \nin the core subproject areas. \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  47 \nEthnic Minorities. A small percentage of ethnic minorities (3%) live scattered throughout the core subproject cities \nand towns. The social analysis determines that they are socially and economically integrated with the majority \npopulation and will not be subject to any adverse impacts as a result of the Project. Land acquisition and resettlement \nof the core subprojects will affect less than 20 ethnic minority people and specific ethnic minority development \nmeasures are included in the resettlement plans. Along with the poor, vulnerable, and women, the minority population \nwill be given prioritized access to jobs created under Project. \nB. Consultation and Participation \n1. The major stakeholders included were (i) groups directly affected by the Project in a positive or negative way, \nincluding men, women, elderly, poor, minorities, schools, businesses, and related organizations; and (ii) government \norganizations such as the Executing Agency, implementing agencies, Development and Reform Commission, Civil \nAffairs Bureau, Poverty Alleviation Office, Women\u2019s Federation, Minority Affairs Office, Finance Bureau, Health \nBureau, Labor and Social Security Bureau, and Environmental Protection Bureau. Several meetings were held with \nstakeholders, including vulnerable groups such as women, the poor, and ethnic minorities. In addition, a number of \nkey  informant  interviews  were  conducted  with  various  bureaus,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  Women\u2019s \nFederation; and past and ongoing projects in complementary areas to inform the project design. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n Information sharing   Consultation   Collaborative decision making   Empowerment \n \n3. Was a consultation and participation plan prepared?   Yes   No \nPublic disclosure of all subproject documents will be made at the project management office and on the ADB website, \nincluding  the  project  information  document,  design  and  monitoring  framework,  resettlement  plans,  summary \nenvironmental impact assessment and environmental management plan, and social and environmental monitoring \nreports. A project information document was prepared for the Project. Booklets outlining the resettlement plans were \ndistributed to affected households and disclosure meetings held. Copies of the booklet are available at the respective \nproject management office, and each affected village office. \n \nPEAP and a training program will be conducted to promote hygiene education and traffic safety education, recycling \nprogram, and social acceptance of tariff increases. The following results are expected to be achieved through the \nPEAP: (i) increased participation and consultation of local population in project implementation and monitoring, \n(ii) increased awareness of project benefits and acceptance of the Project, (iii) increased hygiene knowledge and \nreduced incidence of water- and vector-borne diseases, (iv) increased traffic safety knowledge and lower incidence of \ntraffic  accidents,  (v)  increased  participation  of  beneficiaries  in  garbage  recycling  as  part  of  the  solid  waste \nmanagement program, and (vi) increased environmental awareness on the part of businesses and enterprises. \nCommunity and village project management and monitoring groups will be established to help with the selection of \nlabor for construction, environmental protection and road safety awareness, community grievances, and monitoring of \nimplementation of the social action plan. \nC. Gender and Development \n1. Key Issues. In addition to the economic and employment benefits that will accrue to all beneficiaries, some social \nimpacts of the Project are clearly gender related. Improved drinking water systems, wastewater collection systems, \nand traffic improvement next to the markets will benefit and reduce time burdens for women in particular. The focus \ngroup discussions (FGDs) indicate that women strongly support the Project and anticipate benefits of improved living \nenvironment, new employment opportunities, reduced time burdens, and lower incidence of preventable illness. \n \n2. Actions. Project assurances prioritize women for employment and skills training. Targets have been set for project \nemployment opportunities for women and the poor during construction and for related training. Women will be actively \nengaged in the community and village project management groups and the PEAP promoting hygiene education, \ngarbage recycling program, and acceptance of tariff increases. The PEAP will work with the All Chinese Women \nAssociation and women\u2019s street committees. The project performance monitoring system, resettlement plans, and \nenvironmental management plan will include gender disaggregated data, where relevant. \nIII.

The Project is a sector loan project comprising a series of subprojects in Liaoning \nProvince, all of which will require some land acquisition and population resettlement. Based on \nthe nature of the subprojects, some will need full resettlement plans, some will need short \nresettlement plans, and others will require due diligence reports for cases where the land \nneeded for subproject construction has already been requisitioned. The resettlement planning \nand implementation is designed to ensure that those affected will be better-off or at least not \nworse-off as a result of the Project. In general, the land acquisition and resettlement impacts of \nthe Project vary from subproject to subproject. For the three core subprojects, a full resettlement \nplan  was  prepared  for  the  Donggang  subproject,  a  short  resettlement  plan  for  the  Kazuo \nsubproject, and a due diligence report for the Linghai subproject. Similar subprojects can follow \nany of the three resettlement documents, as relevant. \n \n2.  The impacts of the Project are summarized in Table A12. In total, the Project will acquire \nabout 27.15 hectares (ha) of land, of which a little more than 16 ha is classified as cultivated \nland. The Project will also require the temporary acquisition of 7.6 ha of land, of which 1.8 ha is \nfarmland. A total of 11,174 square meters (m2) of residential houses has been or will be \ndemolished. The total number of affected persons is 1,103. The budget of the Donggang and \nKazuo core subprojects is estimated at $8.7 million. \n \nTable A12: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n    Permanent    Temporary     \nProject  Resettlement  Land  Of which  Land  House   \nComponents  Plan  Acquisition  Cultivated  Occupation  Relocation  Number of \n(subprojects)  Document  (ha)  (ha)  (ha)  (m2)  Affected People\nDonggang \nFull \nUrban \nresettlement  25.69  16.31  0.0  11,174.00a  1,051 \nInfrastructure \nplan \nConstruction \nShort \nKazuo Water  52 (permanent\nresettlement  1.46  1.46  7.6  0.00 \nSupply  land loss) \nplan \nLinghai Urban \nRoad  Due diligence  50.73  37.67  0.0  1,607.18  943 \nConstructionb \nTotalc    27.15  17.77  7.6  11,174.00  1,103 \nha = hectare, m2 = square meter. \na  For Donggang, of the 11,174 m2 to be demolished, 7,645 m2 are residential structures affecting 91 households and \n336 people; and 3,529 m2 are nonresidential structures, affecting eight enterprises and 61 shops. \nb  For Linghai, the required land was acquired in 2007 and the affected amount is not included in the total impacts. \nc   The total does not include the due diligence information for Linghai. \n \n3.  To  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  local  officials,  village \ncommittees, and street committees were closely consulted during the feasibility study stage. \n \n4.  Compensation for permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of the \nPRC (2004) and the State Council Decision to Deepen Reform and Strictly Enforce Land \nAdministration (Document 28, November 2004). House demolition is based on the Provincial \nand  Municipal  Urban  Housing  Demolishment  Administration  Regulations.  The  prepared \nresettlement  plans  comply  with  the  PRC  laws  and  regulation  of  resettlement  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Based on consultations with local governments and \nthose affected, and general practice in the subproject cities and county, the respective city and \ncounty  project  management  offices  (PMOs)  and  implementing  agencies  adopted  a  set  of \ncompensation standards. The resettlement principles established for the Project are (i) land \n ", "50  Appendix 12 \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible by \ndeveloping and comparing a series of design alternatives; (ii) compensation and entitlements \nprovided are based on market or replacement value, and must be adequate to allow those \naffected  to  at  least  maintain  their  pre-project  standard  of  living,  with  the  prospect  of \nimprovement; (iii) the land temporarily occupied and the period for disruption are to be kept to a \nminimum; (iv) all affected people, legal and illegal, are to be taken into consideration and \naccounted for; (v) the per capita landholding after land acquisition will be sufficient to maintain \nthe  previous  livelihood  standards;  (vi)  where  land  allocation  per  capita  is  not  sufficient  to \nmaintain the previous livelihood standards, other income-generating activities will be provided; \n(vii) a preferential policy will be provided to vulnerable groups in such things as compensation, \npayment of special fund, minimum living guarantee, and employment; (viii) all those affected will \nbe adequately informed about eligibility, compensation rates and standards, livelihood and \nincome restoration plans, and project timing; and (ix) close monitoring and timely actions will be \ncarried out to identify and resolve any problems. \n \n5.  Those affected will be notified about the key elements of the resettlement plans prior to \nADB  loan  appraisal.  On  various  occasions  during  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group \ndiscussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local \nrepresentatives  have  participated  in  the  planning;  concerns  were  integrated  into  the \nresettlement plans. The resettlement information booklet of each subproject will be distributed to \naffected villages and households. The resettlement plans will be provided to village offices and \nresident committees, and posted on the ADB website. The respective subproject implementing \nagencies will establish project resettlement units for supervision of implementation, continued \npublic consultation, monitoring of progress, and response to grievances. Procedures to address \ngrievances  will  be  established  and  explanations  included  in  the  resettlement  information \nbooklets. \n \n6.  For land acquisition, at least 80% of land compensation, and 100% of the resettlement \nsubsidy for standing crops will be paid to the affected people. For residential houses and \nnonresidential structures (enterprises and shops) to be demolished, compensation will be paid \nto  owners,  including  those  without  house  certificates.  The  payment  will  be  made  in  cash \naccording to the appraised value of the property. Households that have to relocate will receive a \nrelocation allowance (CNY16.9 million or $2.5 million equivalent). Compensation for standing \ncrops,  auxiliaries,  and  other  assets  will  be  paid  directly  to  those  affected.  Income  losses \nresulting  from  reduced  production  and  sales  and  wages  caused  by  the  Project  will  be \ncompensated in cash. \n \n7.  The resettlement strategy encompasses (i) replacement of housing, and (ii) restoration \nof livelihoods and income. For people losing housing in rural areas, two resettlement options are \navailable: receive cash compensation or cash compensation plus provision of house plots for \nhouse construction by affected people themselves. Assistance will be provided to construct new \nhouses or find available housing close to the original home, if that is their preference. The \nrespective  city  and  county  PMOs,  implementing  agencies,  and  local  town  and  street-level \ngovernments will provide necessary assistance for house construction and relocation during \nresettlement implementation. \n \n8.  Measures for economic rehabilitation include (i) provision of employment opportunities \nduring  project  construction  and  operation,  (ii)  provision  of  basic  social  insurance  to  those \naffected whose land is newly acquired, (iii) deposit of land compensation and resettlement \nsubsidy in banks for income earnings from interest, (iv) development of economic crops with \nhigher economic value, (v) promotion and development of new enterprises and self-employed \nsecondary and tertiary businesses, and (vi) provision of technical training to those affected to \nincrease their skills. \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  51 \n9.  Each  PMO  and  implementing  agency  will  have  at  least  one  full-time  staff  member \nresponsible for land acquisition and another for resettlement. The staff from each subproject \nresettlement unit will take the lead responsibility for coordinating the planning, implementation, \nfinancing, and monitoring of land acquisition and resettlement. They will work closely with \nrelevant village officials, land administration bureaus, and house demolition offices; and be \nresponsible for supervising and monitoring resettlement (e.g., delivery of entitlements, selection \nof new housing sites, restoration of incomes, provision of replacement land, and other economic \nmeasures). A training program will be organized for the resettlement officers. \n \n10.  The cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement for the Donggang and Kazuo \nsubprojects  is  equivalent  to  CNY59.2  million  or  $8.7  million  in  2008  prices,  including \ncontingencies.  Resettlement  implementation  will  be  scheduled  to  precede  the  subproject \nconstruction  schedules,  and  be  completed  prior  to  subproject  construction.  Detailed \nmeasurement surveys will be conducted in each village, neighborhood, and enterprise and \nshop; and the compensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with village committees, \nhouseholds, and enterprises. Based on these surveys, the resettlement plans will be updated \nand submitted to ADB for review and approval. \n \n11.  Internal and external monitoring of resettlement plan implementation will be conducted. \nMonitoring methodologies are specified in the plans. Each implementing agency will carry out \ninternal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of the resettlement \nplan. The PMO and implementing agencies have agreed to a set of supervision milestones with \nADB, to ensure timely and effective implementation of resettlement activities. An independent \nagency under contract to the PMO or implementing agencies will carry out external monitoring \nand evaluation. External monitoring reports will be forwarded directly to the PMO and ADB. \n \n12.  To assess resettlement aspects of subsequent subprojects, a resettlement framework \n(Supplementary Appendix R) was prepared. Each subproject that involves land acquisition and \ninvoluntary resettlement will have to comply with the principles of the resettlement framework \nand  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  Once  specific  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts are confirmed, a short or full resettlement plan must be developed based \non the policies and procedures set forth in the resettlement framework, and in line with the PRC \nlaws and regulations on resettlement and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy have also \nbeen adopted. The objective of the resettlement framework is to ensure that all the affected \npersons (permanent and temporary) whose business or employment places or farmland are \nacquired; or whose houses are demolished; or whose production operations are affected; or \nwhose crops, trees, and property are affected, whether in part or in full, will be compensated for \ntheir losses at replacement costs and/or all necessary assistance so that they may improve or at \nleast keep or reattain their original production facilities or capacity and their living standards. \n \n \n \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The financial analysis was prepared in accordance with the Financial Management and \nAnalysis  of  Projects  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).1 An  assessment  of  financial \nperformance  was  completed  for  Donggang  city  government  (DCG),  Kazuo  Mongolian \nAutonomous county government (KMACG), and Linghai city government (LCG). The financial \nanalysis was undertaken for the revenue-generating component, i.e., the water supply scheme \nin Gongyingzi Town within KMACG. A financial sustainability analysis was undertaken for the \nnon-revenue-generating  components:  roads  and  river  upgrading  in  Donggang  and  road \ndevelopment in Linghai. \n \nA.  Revenue-Generating Component: Kazuo Water Supply \n \n2.  Methodology. The financial analysis measured the ability of the Kazuo subproject to \ngenerate  sufficient  revenues  from  operations  to  meet  all  costs,  including  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M),  debt  servicing,  depreciation,  and  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  on \ninvestment. The analysis incorporates the required tariff increases into the financial model and \ncompares these with the affordability of households. The base case financial internal rate of \nreturn  (FIRR)  is  compared  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  Sensitivity \nanalysis was conducted to assess the impact of changes in costs and revenues. \n \n3.  Financial  projections  (balance  sheet,  and  income  and  cash  flow  statements)  were \ndeveloped for the water supply company, Gongyingzi District Potable Water Company, based \non the projected operating performance of the Project. The financial analysis is based on \nincremental cash flow effects from the Project. \n \n4.  Assumptions. All analysis was conducted in constant July 2008 prices. The FIRR was \ncalculated using incremental annual cash flows over 25 years with no residual value. Project \ncapital expenditures are estimated based on the proposed implementation schedule and include \nphysical contingencies. O&M costs include only incremental costs incurred under the Project. \nRevenues are calculated based on generated volume, tariff rate, and tariff collection efficiency. \n \n5.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital. The WACC is calculated in real terms. Funding \nsources are the ADB loan, contributing 42%, and counterpart funds from KMACG, contributing \n58%. Assumed nominal costs of funds are 4.5% for the ADB loan and 0.8% for government \nfunds. Long-term inflation is estimated at 1.7% for foreign costs and 5.1% for local costs. \nAllowing for taxes at 25.0% on both loan and equity, the WACC is estimated at 1.2%. \n \n6.  Tariffs and Affordability. The tariff is expected to be increased gradually to full cost \nrecovery for O&M, depreciation, and debt service on the basis that the Project will help improve \nservice delivery, effective tariff mechanisms, efficiencies in fee collection, and education and \nawareness of tariff increases. The Government agrees with the gradual tariff increase. During \nproject implementation, water tariffs will cover all O&M where the weighted average water tariff \nis about CNY2.47/m3 and cost recovery2 is 69%. In 2016, after 3 years of operations, full cost \nrecovery will be achieved. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n2  Cost recovery refers to recouping operating costs and debt service costs through the tariff. Full cost recovery \n(100% and above) occurs when all costs (including operating costs, debt service and depreciation) are recouped. \n ", "  Appendix 13  53 \nTable A13.1: Projected Tariffs and Cost Recovery (percent) \nItem  2013  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020  2021  2022 \nWeighted average water supply tariff, CNY/m3  2.47  2.65  2.81  2.81  2.98  2.98  3.03  3.03  3.09 \nCost recovery (%)  69  93  103  107  118  121  135  135  138 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7.  Affordability.  The  response  from  the  household  survey  indicates  that  the  average \nannual household income is CNY20,964. Assuming a daily water consumption of 120 liters per \ncapita per day and average household size of three, the daily requirement for water will be \nabout 360 liters per household and the annual water bill about CNY370.

Financial Management Assessment \n \n18.  The financial management assessment was carried out in accordance with Guidelines \nfor the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB using \nthe financial management assessment questionnaire. The assessment included the Liaoning \nprovincial government (LPG) and the implementing agencies. \n \n19.  The financial management capability of LPG as the Executing Agency was found to be \nadequate for implementation of the Project. LPG has previous experience with the World Bank \n ", "56  Appendix 13 \nin executing projects of this nature. Some training in ADB financial management and reporting \nprocedures will, however, be required. \n \n20.  All implementing agencies have prescribed financial procedures that define duties of key \nfinance staff and procedures for record keeping and cash management. These procedures are \ngenerally followed, and internal controls such as proper authorization of transactions, payroll \ncontrols, and regular bank reconciliations, are generally adhered to. Since this is the first ADB \nproject that the implementing agencies are undertaking, training in ADB financial management \nand reporting procedures will be required. \n \n21.  Accounting and financial management systems for financial reporting and accounting \nare developed and adequate for the purpose of loan implementation, although improvements to \ninternal control might be required in the area of segregation of duties. To address this, additional \nstaff  should  be  recruited  during  project  implementation.  Audit  arrangements  are  generally \nadequate and the implementing agencies will be required to submit independently audited \nannual  financial  statements  and  project  accounts  to  ADB  as  a  loan  covenant.  Each \nimplementing agency will be helped to establish a reliable financial management system at the \nbeginning of project implementation. The Kazuo water utility will keep accounts in accordance \nwith commercial accounting principles and be subject to an independent external audit by a \nsuitably qualified firm of commercial auditors. Accounting will be in accordance with relevant \nPRC standards. A capacity-building component to strengthen financial management is included \nin the Project. \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  57 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The economic analysis covers both the Project as a whole and the three individual core \nsubproject components. For the Project as a whole, the analysis covers the economic rationale \nfor public intervention, goals of the investment plan, and general design of the plan including \nselection criteria for subprojects. The economic analysis also evaluates the individual core \nsubproject  components  for  least-cost  and  benefit\u2013cost  analysis.  Economic  analysis  was \nconducted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects1 (1997) and \nEconomic Analysis Retrospective 2005: Strengthening Quality\u2013at Entry of ADB\u2019s Operations2 \n(2006) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The detailed economic analysis and least-cost \nanalysis are in Supplementary Appendix U. \n \nA.  Analysis of the Overall Project \n \n2.  Rationale for Public Intervention. The primary motivation for the Project results from \nincreasing concern over the inability of infrastructure provision to keep pace with population and \neconomic growth in small cities and towns in Liaoning Province. Due to continuing urbanization \nand strong growth of the industrial and commercial sectors across the province, many cities and \ntowns are experiencing high economic growth rates, rising household incomes, increased use of \nprivate cars, changes in living style that create a more diversified range of travel demands, and \nchanges in urban land use patterns that are increasingly dependent on motorized transport. At \nthe same time, local governments have not been able to provide the basic urban infrastructure \nneeded  to  support  this  growth  and  to  mitigate  negative  environmental  impacts  of \nindustrialization and urbanization. Furthermore, these small cities and towns face environmental \nthreats from pollution of surface and subsurface waters from untreated garbage, water pollution \nin  rivers  and  streams,  poor  drainage  and  flooding,  and  poor  sewerage.  Local  residents, \nincluding the poor and other vulnerable groups, are bearing the cost of these deteriorating urban \nenvironments. \n \n3.  The Project involves government intervention at several different levels. The Liaoning \nprovincial  government  is  promoting  development  of  small  cities  and  towns  in  a  more \ncoordinated  and  cost-effective  manner  by  bringing  about  more  sustainable  investments  in \nphysical and environmental protection infrastructure that aims to improve the quality of life. \nInvolvement of the Liaoning provincial government is justified since the development program \nspans several small cities, counties, and towns. The city, county, and town governments are \ncoordinating and implementing the elements of the urban transport master plans and making \nindividual  investments  in  roads;  water  supply;  heating;  and  environmental  improvement \nincluding  garbage  and  solid  waste,  proper  drainage,  and  connection  of  households  to  the \nwastewater network. They will be involved in owning and managing the completed facilities. \n \n4.  Goals of the Investment Plan. The Project is a direct response to Liaoning\u2019s 11th Five-\nYear Plan (11FYP) to promote sustainable economic development, particularly in its small cities \nand  towns,  via  construction  and  upgrading  of  road  infrastructure,  water  supply,  and \nenvironmental improvement. The 11FYP recognizes that achievement of these goals will require \nimprovement of basic municipal services and environment quality in these areas. All project \ncomponents are integral components of the 11FYP. City and county governments are required \nto make investments in roads, water supply, heating, and environmental improvement. The \nsmall city and town government master plans are reasonably sound, and are integrated with the \noverall planning process. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997.

The selection of the three core \nsubprojects  was  based  on  socioeconomic  indicators  and  preparedness  to  undertake \ninvestments  in  municipal  infrastructure.  The  core  subprojects  are  Donggang  City,  Kazuo \nMongolian Autonomous County, and Linghai City. The availability of viable investment projects \ndirectly supporting approved development master plans and programs, and the potential to \nserve  as  models  in  the  preparation  of  subsequent  components  during  sector  loan \nimplementation are some of the considerations in selecting subprojects. Targeting and selection \nof subsequent subproject cities and towns will be based, among other factors, on their potential \nto grow economically and provide jobs to in-migrants from rural areas. Employment growth is \ndeemed to contribute more to the Government\u2019s goal of closing the rural\u2013urban income gap \nthan the growth of production. The core subprojects focus on development of citywide primary \nand secondary infrastructure, with emphasis on environmental infrastructure. \n \n6.  Key urbanization issues are (i) inadequate availability of infrastructure such as water \nsupply,  heat  supply,  and  wastewater  and  solid  waste  treatment;  (ii)  severe  air,  river,  and \ngroundwater pollution; (iii) significant share of the urban population living below the poverty line; \nand (iv) lack of holistic and integrated management of urban development. The Project aims to \naddress  these  issues  in  the  participating  cities  and  towns  to  help  promote  balanced  and \nenvironmentally sustainable urbanization; narrow the rural\u2013urban gap; and improve production, \nemployment, and living conditions. \n \n7.  The criteria for identifying and selecting subprojects and components are (i) confirmation \nby the participating local government of its ability and willingness to arrange for counterpart \nfunding, (ii) confirmation by the participating local government of its willingness to comply with \nADB safeguard policies and other requirements, (iii) implementation of the component from \n2009 to 2015, (iv) eligibility of the components (the sectors must be included in the list of eligible \ninfrastructure and municipal services, (v) anticipated positive impact on the urban environment, \n(vi) anticipated positive impact on employment generation and/or economic growth, and (vii) \nanticipated positive impact on the coverage or service level of infrastructure and municipal \nservices. \n \nB.  Demand Analysis \n \n8.  Donggang City Roads and Associated Municipal Services and Bridge, and Linghai \nCity Roads and Associated Municipal Services. The demand analysis was performed in \nterms of (i) selection and definition of the representative vehicle types; (ii) assessment of annual \naverage daily traffic (AADT); and (iii) forecast of demand. A vehicle fleet consists of a mix of \nseveral  vehicle  types  that  use  a  road  network  (cars,  trucks,  buses,  motorcycles,  and \nnonmotorized  transport).  Traffic  counts  were  conducted  on  each  of  the  proposed  road \ncomponents. The traffic survey implemented in April 2008 serves as the basis for determining \nAADT. To establish the AADT from the average daily traffic, seasonal variations are assessed \ntaking into account the main factors driving changes in traffic patterns, such as the weather \n(rainy season, winter, etc.), agricultural cycles, holiday periods, and tourist season. The traffic \nforecast comprises growth of (i) normal traffic, which corresponds to the growth that would occur \neven without improving the road network; and (ii) generated traffic, which occurs only if the road \nnetwork is improved significantly and/or new roads are constructed. Forecasts for normal traffic \ngrowth is based mainly on official gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates. Traffic forecast \nflows are subsequently based on an assumed income elasticity of demand relative to GDP \ngrowth.3 The forecast GDP growth rates were applied to the calibrated base year matrices to \nproduce passenger and freight vehicle flows. \n \n                                                 \n3  Elasticity coefficients are based on the previous studies and are assumed to be 1.4 for passengers and 1.1 for \nfreight. \n ", "  Appendix 14  59 \n9.  Kazuo (Gongyingzi) Water Supply. The Project will mainly address the water supply \nshortage in the new district, but it will also improve water quality and provide safe water for \ndomestic use in the urban area of the town. Water demand is estimated to reach 32,670 cubic \nmeters (m3)/day by 2020. Of this amount, the demand for recycled water (for urban landscaping, \nstreet cleaning, and partially for industrial purposes) is 5,640 m3/day; the existing capacity is \n4,000 m3/day. The net water requirement is therefore about 23,000 m3 per day, which is the \ncapacity that will be provided by the Project. This will benefit close to 260,000 people or 80,000 \nhouseholds. The Project will supply drinking water according to national standards 24 hours a \nday at 120 liters per capita per day. Water pressure will reach at least the 6th floor of apartment \nbuildings; special measures will be taken for high-rise buildings. \n \n10.  Evaluation of Individual Components. The methods of economic analysis adopted are \nbenefit\u2013cost analysis and least-cost analysis. Benefit\u2013cost analysis is mainly applied to the \nwater  supply  and  roads  components,  while  least-cost  analysis  is  applied  to  the  river \nimprovement, area upgrading, and drainage and wastewater network components. For the \nwater supply component, the estimates of economic benefits are based on the results of the \ncontingent valuation survey conducted for the Kazuo water supply. The survey aims to elicit \nbeneficiary willingness to pay for improved services as a result of the Project. The survey is \nconducted at the household level and has three parts: (i) a discussion of the existing situation in \nterms of service levels as well as direct and indirect impacts on the well-being of the residents \nand the community; (ii) a discussion on the expected improvements in service, living conditions, \nand the impact on employment as a result of expected increases in investments in industries, \nincluding the consequence on increasing incomes for the households and the city, county, and \ntown; and (iii) eliciting willingness to pay for the expected improvements and benefits from the \nProject.  Least-cost  analysis  will  involve  cost-effectiveness  analysis  of  the  least-cost  option \nrecommended for the component. \n \n11.  In addition to being part of the 11FYP, each component is economically justified on its \nown. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were estimated for each road component. The \nEIRRs are compared with the economic opportunity cost of capital, which is assumed to be \n12%. Major benefits quantified for the roads include (i) savings in vehicle operating costs \nresulting from reduced travel distance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings resulting from \nfewer accidents, (iii) reduced maintenance costs, (iv) savings in the value of passengers\u2019 time \nand of freight tied up in transit, (v) generated traffic resulting from reduced transportation costs, \nand (vi) road safety benefits. \n \n12.  An economic analysis of the project component was conducted over 25 years, inclusive \nof project construction. Economic benefits and costs are denominated in terms of the domestic \nprice numeraire and expressed in constant mid-2008 prices. International costs were converted \nto local currency costs using an exchange rate of CNY6.8 per $1. Tradable components were \nadjusted to economic prices using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.08 for the effects of \nforeign exchange, and nontraded components valued at domestic market prices. A shadow \nprice is used to put an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor but not on the \nwages paid to skilled labor, because there is no surplus of skilled workers. A shadow wage rate \nfactor of 0.50 was used to convert the financial wage rate to an economic opportunity cost of \nlabor. \n \n13.  The economic costs of the core components include (i) capital costs including land \nacquisition and resettlement costs, and environmental mitigation and monitoring costs; and  \n(ii) costs of operation and maintenance (O&M) including cost of replacement of depreciated \nequipment.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  are  estimated  based  on  their \nopportunity  costs,  that  is,  the  agricultural  output  foregone  and  the  re-siting  of  displaced \n \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \nactivities.4 Transfer payments, including taxes and interests, are excluded from the economic \ncosts, while physical contingencies are included. \n \n14.  For the overall economic analysis, a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing economic \ncosts is utilized with the feasibility indicators expressed in the following measures of viability: net \npresent value and economic internal rate of return (EIRR). The economic viability of each \ncomponent was determined using the EIRR as the principal quantitative measuring tool. The \nEIRR is estimated by comparing the with-component and without-component scenarios. A core \nsubproject component is considered economically viable if the calculated EIRR is higher than \n12%, the social discount rate prescribed by ADB. The project component\u2019s financial cash flows \nare tested for responsiveness to changes in the values of key project variables with the use of \nsensitivity analysis. The following variables are evaluated for their impact on the Project: (i) 10% \nincrease in construction cost, (ii) 20% increase in O&M cost, (iii) 20% decrease in benefits, and \n(iv) combination of (i) and (iii); and (v) delay of benefits by 1 year. \n \nC.  Results of Economic Analysis of Individual Components \n \n15.  The economic analysis indicates that the three components are economically viable and \nthat they stand up to sensitivity tests where costs increase and benefits decrease. The cost of \ninstitutional development was incorporated into each component road\u2019s economic analysis. The \nEIRRs  of  the  individual  components  are  shown  in  Table  A14.  The  economic  analysis \ndemonstrates the economic viability of the three components. The results of the sensitivity \nanalysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  components\u2019  economic  viability:  changes  in  key \nvariables, 20% increase in construction costs and O&M costs, delay of benefits by 1 year, \ndecrease in benefits and simultaneous increase in costs and decrease in benefits. \n \nTable A14: Summary of Results for All Components \nMethod of  Results of Analysis \nComponent  Economic  EIRR   NPV  \nAnalysis  (%)  (CNY million)\nDonggang Roads and Associated Municipal Services and Bridge  BCA  18.0  25.5 \nKazuo (Gongyingzi) Water Supply  CV, BCA  16.7  36.6 \nLinghai City Roads and Associated Municipal Services  BCA  18.4  40.5 \nOverall Project    17.7  102.6 \nBCA = benefit-cost analysis, CV = contingent valuation, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present \nvalue. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n                                                 \n4  The economic opportunity cost of land will be assumed to be equal to the replacement value of farmland calculated \nfor land compensation. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090921103742+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090922101335+08'00'", "Title": ""}, "author_page": "Vice-President  C.
