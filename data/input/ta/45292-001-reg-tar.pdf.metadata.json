INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) overarching goal is an Asia and Pacific region \nfree of poverty. ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 commits the institution to monitoring, evaluating, and \nreporting on its activities using new results frameworks focused on ensuring management for \ndevelopment results.1 Strategy 2020 and the new financial sector operations plan firmly commit \nADB to stronger, broader engagement in financial inclusion and in ongoing improvements in \npoverty reduction methods.2 The intersection of these commitments is the use of the most \nmodern and effective tools for evaluating poverty and financial inclusion projects. A key method \nto ensure results is to strengthen the understanding of developing member country (DMC) \npolicymakers, researchers, and implementing agencies about new evaluation methods and use \nof results to enhance policy and practice.  \n \n2.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  improve  DMC  ability  to  measure,  evaluate,  and \nreplicate  access  to  finance  and  other  related  poverty  reduction  efforts  by  increasing \nunderstanding  and  application  of  randomized  control  trials  and  other  modern  evaluation \ntechniques. The TA will achieve this result in three ways. First, it will introduce new evaluation \ntechniques to DMC officials and academics in a short, practical training course, with information \non how to apply the results to improve policy and practice. Second, the TA will run a 3-day \ninternational conference, where practitioners and researchers from around the globe will present \nthe latest evaluation results of projects in financial access and poverty reduction to policymakers. \nGender  impact  will  be  an  essential  aspect  of  the  presentations.  Finally,  an  evaluation \nimplementation grants program will facilitate evaluation of benefits and capacity building for \nDMCs. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB has continued its efforts to enhance evaluation of its own projects, to help learn and \ndemonstrate  results,  and  to  use  the  results  and  new  technologies  of  other  evaluators  to \nenhance learning and good practice.4 However, it needs to help expand DMC knowledge of \nnewer methods used in evaluation worldwide. This is particularly important when new evaluation \ntools are used on innovative projects in financial inclusion and poverty reduction.  \n \n4.  Refined  evaluation methods  help  facilitate  better  project  evaluation  and  subsequent \nproject improvements.5 In particular, improved evaluation methods have enabled more rigor in \ndetermining  the  impact  of  projects  on  affected  households.  One  of  the  more  important \nimprovements in evaluation methodology is the introduction of randomized control trials (RCTs) \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

Participants from \nBhutan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Philippines, \nTajikistan, and Viet Nam have participated in training on general evaluation and wish to engage in further capacity \nbuilding. The PRC has specifically asked about this TA and expressed interest, by email, through the Chinese \nAcademy of Sciences. All ADB DMCs will be invited; participation is on a first-come, first-served basis pending \ncollaboration arrangements by other development partners for a larger group.  \n5   ADB. 2010.

RCTs are \nderived from methods used for drug testing. They measure an intervention\u2019s effect by randomly \nassigning individuals (or groups of individuals) to an intervention group or a control group. RCTs \nenable researchers to accurately assess whether the intervention itself, as opposed to other \nfactors, caused the observed outcomes. RCTs may not be feasible in cases where the impact \ncannot be effectively randomized. In such cases, rigorous comparative studies are a better \nmethod.  \n \n5.  Innovations are emerging from new work in RCTs, especially in access to finance, \nresource transfers such as community-driven development and conditional cash transfers, and \nwork with the ultra-poor. Almost all of the new evaluation work considers sex-disaggregated \ndata, enabling better determination of distinct effects on women and men. Recently released \nbooks, such as Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty6 and \nMore Than Good Intentions: How a New Economics Is Helping to Solve Global Poverty7 provide \nintriguing insights on poverty reduction efforts based on results of recent evaluations. More \nknowledge  is  continuing  to  emerge.  For  example,  the  RCT  of  Progresa  in  Mexico,  an \nexperiment  on  conditional  cash  transfers to families  dependent  on their  children  attending \nschool  and  clinics,  shows  the  power  of  evaluation  results  on  policy.  However,  significant \ncritiques of RCT methodology and comments on alternatives are important to consider.8 \n \n6.  In October 2010, the first Microfinance Impact and Innovation Conference took place in \nNew  York  City.  It  was  a  unique  forum  to  communicate  recently  accumulated  evaluation \nknowledge and generation of innovations in product design and research.9 Academics and \nimplementers  presented  evaluation  results  on  RCTs  of  new  products  and  services  in \nmicrofinance, small and medium-sized enterprise development, social development, education, \nultra-poor development, and other poverty reduction efforts. Much of the research was just \nfinalized. The findings identified errors in traditional approaches and suggested some new ways \nof addressing poverty issues. Researchers also demonstrated ways of determining differential \neffects  of  a  single  change  on  people\u2014by gender  or  age, for  example.  At  the  end  of the \nconference, researchers participated in a \u201cmarketplace\u201d where they proposed ideas they would \nlike to evaluate in the field, and development partners and country representatives expressed \ninterest in engagement and funding. The participants strongly felt that replication of the event \nand expanding participation to include DMC policy makers would significantly increase its value. \nOther development partners, such as the Inter-American Development Bank, Citi Foundation, \nand the Islamic Development Bank found this process very valuable. They are consulting with \nADB for collaboration arrangements, specifically to finance more DMC participants participating \nin the conference and to increase the grant funds available. \n \n                                                \n6  A. Bannerjee and E. Duflos. 2011. Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty. New \nYork: Public Affairs Publishing. \n7  D. Karlan and J. Appel. 2011.  More Than Good Intentions: How a New Economics Is Helping to Solve Global \nPoverty. Boston: Dutton Adult Press. \n8  A. Deaton. 2010. Instruments, Randomization, and Learning About Development.

Following the evaluation over 30 countries have introduced \nconditional cash transfers. \n9  The event was hosted by the Financial Access Initiative, a consortium of development economists at three \nAmerican academic institutions, New York University, Yale University, and Harvard University; Innovations for \nPoverty Action, a American-based nonprofit, which develops solutions to social problems and provided all technical \nsetup, conference management, and proceedings; and the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, a network of \nprofessors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which conducts research on poverty reduction. Moody\u2019s, \nDeutsche Bank, and Global Call to Action against Poverty also contributed resources. Planned for 100, more than \n350 academics, implementers, and a few development partners and DMC officials attended the 3-day event. \n ", "  3 \n7.  DMC officials rarely have the opportunity to talk to field practitioners from other countries \nand continents to discuss the results of field innovations in financial inclusion and related \npoverty reduction. They never have the opportunity to see practitioners pairing with world-class \nacademics to prove (or disprove) the results of their approaches in the field. The presentations \nat New York Conference enabled both development partners and DMC officials to learn about \nwhat people were trying elsewhere, and what had worked (or not) and why. They also heard \nhow these results were assessed in terms of the differential impacts on men and women, and \nwhat could be done to improve the impact. As countries in Asia and the Pacific face a broad \nrange of issues from the middle-income trap10 to fragile state risks, it is helpful for DMC officials \nto understand what innovations have been tried in other countries, what options are surfacing, \nand what else they can explore.  \n \n8.  Bringing this information to the DMCs and encouraging the use of improved evaluation \ntechniques in appropriate ways would bring substantial benefits. Providing training to key DMC \nofficials and academics would enable them to understand and use new evaluation techniques \nmore confidently. They would then more readily use evaluation results when determining policy \nand new initiatives for financial inclusion and poverty reduction projects. Learning about and \ndiscussing worldwide results of evaluations in a conference setting would help everyone learn \nhow evaluations work and what they teach us. Innovations can also be shared. ADB could then \nfacilitate pilots of evaluation techniques for interested DMCs to use in measuring the results of \nfinancial inclusion and related poverty reduction methods.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be more effective evaluation of financial inclusion and related \npoverty reduction projects in participating DMCs. The outcome will be increased understanding \nand application of sex-disaggregated randomized control trials and other modern evaluation \ntools, such as rigorous comparison, for poverty reduction innovations by participating DMC \nacademics and officials. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The outputs are (i) a 3-day training course in impact evaluation techniques, (ii) a 3-day \ninternational conference sharing the latest evaluation results worldwide, and (iii) implementation \nof  competitively  awarded  innovation  evaluation  grants  for  DMCs.  Blending  training  and \nexperience with resources to use the new knowledge immediately provides strong opportunities \nfor  success.  Completion  of  the  evaluation  grants,  with  ongoing  consultations  involving  the \ntrained officials, will reinforce lessons and engagement in the evaluation process. Gender is a \ncritical issue, and thus will be integral to learning, presentations, and participation; the intention \nis that one-third of those targeted for all three outputs will be women. \n \n11.  The 3-day training course will be developed and delivered specifically for DMC policy \nmakers and researchers. The participants will be surveyed well in advance of the course to \ndetermine understanding, interests, and particular responsibilities for financial inclusion and \nrelated poverty reduction. The course will be tailored to their specific practical needs and \n                                                \n10 The middle-income trap can be defined as a transition point when a developing economy has reached middle- \nincome levels using existing natural and human resources and traditional industrial growth. It is generally agreed \nthat countries do not transition to high income unless they can move to service-led, highly innovative economies. \n ", "4   \nrequests, but be sufficiently general to have broader application. Recent experience of the \nIndependent Evaluation Department (IED) in basic evaluation training for DMC officials will be \ntaken  into  account.  The  3-day  training  will  occur  during  the  end  of  the  week  before  the \ninternational  conference,  to  allow  participants  to  engage  immediately  in  the  conference.  A \nsurvey will be conducted after the course to determine changes in knowledge and practice. The \ncourse will be videotaped and an e-learning course provided on the ADB website. \n \n12.  The  international  conference  will  incorporate  the  latest  findings  in  evaluation,  with \nconference dates tentatively set for 28\u201331 August 2012 to accommodate academic calendars.11 \nThe  conference  involves  3  days  of  presentations,  a  half-day  for  grant  approvals,  and  a \nmarketplace, for 4 days total (para. 13). The 3-day conference will include six plenary sessions \nas  well  as  concurrent  sessions  on  microfinance,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises, \nconditional cash transfers, work with the ultra-poor, and information dissemination.12 Gender-\ndisaggregated  data,  analysis,  and  results  will  be  actively  sought  and  incorporated  in  all \npresentations if possible. Intended participants include academics, presenters, development \npartners, regulators, and policy makers in the five topic areas. Two lunch sessions will be \nprovided  for  academics  to  discuss  technical  RCT  issues.  All  presented  papers  will  have \ncommenters. The conference proceedings will be provided on the ADB website as a knowledge \nproduct; all other material publication rights will rest with the presenters.  \n \n13.  The competitive innovation evaluation grants will be transparently allocated to rigorous, \ninnovative research projects with policy relevance to the DMCs. Two field implementation grants \nfor $100,000 each to help implement impact evaluations and for four start-up grants of $25,000 \nto design suitable impact evaluation proposals for key projects will be awarded, with more funds \npossible from  pending collaboration  arrangements.13 The  process, to  be  undertaken for  4 \nmonths preceding the conference, will involve (i) development and confirmation of the criteria \nand panels, (ii) distribution of a request for proposals, (iii) initial screening, (iv) peer review, (v) \npanel review, (vi) selection of grantees, (vii) notification and disbursement, and (viii) reporting on \nprogress  and  results.  ADB  will  approve  the  process  and  all  grants.  The  grants  will  be \nannounced at the end of the international conference, along with a marketplace allowing new \nideas to emerge and be discussed.  Grants will be implemented over the final two and a half \nyears of the TA, with researchers and practitioners engaging with DMC officials on the process \nand results as well as policy implications. General write-ups of the results will be provided for \nknowledge sharing on the ADB website; all other publication rights will rest with the grantees. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA cost is estimated at $950,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The TA will cover training and \nconference costs, remuneration, travel and per diem, and miscellaneous expenses. Proceeds of \nthe TA will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time.)  The cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \n                                                \n11  The conference venue has not yet been established, as the financiers may provide additional resources based on \nthe location; Beijing, Paris, Manila, Seoul, and Sydney are being considered. The Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development has been approached regarding donation of conference facilities and translation in \ntheir Paris location. The location will be finalized by the end of February 2012 and final number of participants will \nbe defined at that time, based on total available resources, with a minimum of 100 and a maximum of 450. \n12 An indicative list is included in Appendix 3.  \n13 The amount allocated to the grants as pilot testing normally should not exceed 30%.  In this case the total is 31.5% \nand is justified by the nature of the R-CDTA to encourage improved evaluation through demonstration effects. \n ", "  5 \n15.  Since October 2010, ADB has been actively discussing collaboration arrangements with \nthe Inter-American Development Bank for significant additional participation of their developing \ncountry officials in the training and conference, and for separate funds to be awarded to grantee \napplicants for evaluation activities in their developing member countries.  Citi Foundation and \nthe Islamic Development Bank stated that they were considering additional funds for the same \npurpose,  and  the  African  Development  Bank  has  been  approached  for  the  same  type  of \nengagement. Such additional funds would be separately managed. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The  TA  will  begin  on  15  January  2012  and  end  on  31  May  2015.  The  41-month \nimplementation is needed for completion of the innovation evaluation grants in the DMCs. ADB \nwill  be  the  executing  agency.  The  Public  Management,  Financial  Sector,  and  Regional \nCooperation  Division  of  the  East  Asia  Department  in collaboration  with IED\u2019s  Independent \nEvaluation Division 2 will implement the TA. The assignments will be split between the co-team \nleaders. The IED officer will guide the training course development and delivery, and the non-\nADB financed grants selection implementation; while the East Asia Department officer will \noversee work with parallel cofinanciers, conference setup, and ADB-related grants selection and \nimplementation. The co-team leaders will work together to manage these and all other matters, \nand with the consultant will to help ameliorate the risk that DMCs do not use the new evaluation \ntechnologies.  \n \n17.  One international consultant will be recruited for 8 person-months, intermittent, by single-\nsource selection from the Financial Access Initiative14 through submission of proposal of the \nindividual by the Innovations for Poverty Action. The consultant will manage all arrangements \nfor the training development and delivery, conference setup, management and logistics, grants \ncompetition,  and general grants  implementation  oversight. The  Financial  Access  Initiative\u2019s \nInnovations for Poverty Action established and ran the first conference in 2010, administers a \nGates Fund grant for evaluation grants, and has established a unique and extensive worldwide \nnetwork of evaluation researchers. It has a unique capability to provide a qualified research \nprofessional for this task. ADB will engage the consultant in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Any procurement under the TA, \nincluding  innovation  evaluation  grants,  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  The knowledge products include the training e-learning tool, conference proceedings, \ngrant methodology, and grant results. ADB will provide all of these on its website and through \nthe Financial Access Initiative networks. In addition, both IED and East Asia Department will \nshare the materials with officials in the DMCs and encourage full participation in all events.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \n \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $950,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening Evaluation of Poverty Reduction Innovations, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n                                                \n14 The initiative is housed at the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University.
