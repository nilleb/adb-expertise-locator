THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The  Government  of  Mongolia,  during  the  country  programming  mission  held  in \nUlaanbaatar in March 2018, requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a lending \nsupport to prepare the Forestry Sector Development Program (formerly the Community-Based \nSustainable Forest Management and Policy Reform Project). The ensuing loan is included in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2020\u20132021 and the proposed transaction \ntechnical assistance (TA) is included in ADB\u2019s nonlending pipeline for 2018.1 \n \n2.  The forestry sector is underdeveloped in Mongolia and has limited economic contribution \ndespite its potential for growth and livelihood opportunities, particularly in the rural areas. In line \nwith the government\u2019s focus to promote livelihood opportunities outside of the traditional livestock \nherding and mining, forestry has the potential to be a priority sector for diversified livelihoods and \neconomic growth. With about 18.5 million hectares of forest land, accounting for approximately \n11.8% of the country\u2019s land area, there are an abundance of forest resources. The forest sector \nis  conventionally  defined  as  commercial  activities  relating  to  the  extraction,  production, \nprocessing, sale and consumption of wood products and sometimes non-timber forest products. \nMongolia has a small forestry manufacturing sector with potential to grow. In addition to the wood \nproducts, forests serve an important role in providing ecosystem goods and services that are vital \nto human health, wildlife habitat and diversity, watershed services, carbon storage, and scenic \nlandscapes. \n \n3.  The project aims to increase income generating opportunities from forests by improving \nsector functions and services, applying sustainable forest management to improve forest health, \nprotection, and resources, and support the growth of the forest industry and forest products. The \nproject will: (i) support sector development through enabling policies, institutional reform and \nstrengthening, and operationalizing a management information system; (ii) implement sustainable \nforest management at the local level by building capacity and systems to support forest user \ngroups involvement in forest management and develop livelihood opportunities; and (iii) support \nthe rehabilitation and modernization of the forest industry to increase production, resource use \nefficiency, improve product quality, enhance value chains, and increase inclusive and equitable \nbenefit sharing along the value chain. \n \n 4.  The ensuing project is estimated to cost $40.4 million. ADB is requested to finance $40.0 \nmillion largely for investment, policy and sector reform, and capacity building through a loan. The \ncentral and local governments will provide in-kind contribution equivalent to $0.4 million. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  The executing agency, the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET), has limited \nexperience  with  ADB  requirements  for  loan  preparation.
