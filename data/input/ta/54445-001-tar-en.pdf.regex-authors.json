INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help accelerate private \nsector development in Viet Nam. Specifically, working closely with the Government of Viet \nNam, the TA will support public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs), the private sector, and state-\nowned  enterprises  (SOEs)  through  policy  advice,  support  for  project  preparation,  and \ninstitutional capacity building to enhance sustainable economic growth. The TA will contribute \nto the following Strategy 2030 operational priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB): (i) \naccelerating progress on gender equality; (ii) tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (iii) making cities more livable; \nand  (iv)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.1 The  TA  will  also  support \nStrategy 2030\u2019s goals of (i) harnessing the private sector to achieve operational priorities and \n(ii) using a One ADB approach to enhance ADB\u2019s value addition with the Southeast Asia \nRegional Department, the Advisory Division 1 of the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership, and \nthe Public-Private Partnership Thematic Group jointly co-leading the TA\u2019s implementation. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020,2 \nwhich prioritizes expanding the role of the private sector in driving Viet Nam\u2019s development. \nADB\u2019s forthcoming country partnership strategy for Viet Nam is expected to retain this priority.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Infrastructure deficit. Between 2011 and 2020, Viet Nam invested an estimated $117 \nbillion  in  infrastructure.3 As  a  result,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  infrastructure  ranking  from  the  World \nEconomic Forum improved from 123rd out of 142 economies in 2011 to 79th out of 137 \neconomies in 2017. Despite these gains, Viet Nam\u2019s infrastructure remains underdeveloped, \nand Viet Nam ranks behind its regional peers Indonesia (52nd), Malaysia (22nd), and Thailand \n(43rd).4 The spending required to close the infrastructure deficit is significant. Between 2021 \nand 2030, Viet Nam will need an estimated $237 billion to meet the targets of its upcoming \nSocio-Economic Development Strategy 2021\u20132030, maintain growth rates of 6%\u20137%, and \nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals.5 To fund this investment, Viet Nam will need to \nmobilize between 2021 and 2030 an estimated $49 billion more than its historical spending \ntrajectory.6 \n \n4.  The  government  already  shoulders  90%  of  infrastructure  spending,7 and  public \ninvestment as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) at 8% is higher than in Indonesia \n(4%), Malaysia (6%), the Philippines (5%), and Thailand (6%).8 However, the government\u2019s \nfiscal space is likely to be lower in the post coronavirus disease (COVID-19) era. Hence, the \ngovernment aims to enhance fiscal discipline further and leverage more private financing. \nEven prior to the pandemic, the government managed to lower the national public debt from \n64% of GDP in 2016 to 56% of GDP in 2020. Yet, while Viet Nam has adroitly managed the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, its fiscal deficit still increased from an average of 1.8% between 2016 \nand 2019 to 5.8% in 2020, and growth in GDP fell from an average of 6.8% between 2016 and \n2019  to  2.9%  in  2020.9 As  such,  the  government  cannot  support  large  increases  in \ninfrastructure spending and is looking to mobilize new sources of financing.  \n \n1   Contribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3); \nADB. 2018.

The government recognizes that the private sector has the \npotential to help close the infrastructure deficit. The upcoming Socio-Economic Development \nStrategy  2021\u20132030  prioritizes  removing  barriers  to  open competition  and  developing  a \nsupportive enabling environment to increase the private sector\u2019s contribution to GDP from 43% \nin  2020  to  between  60%  and  65%  by  2030,  including  a  larger  role  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment.10 PPPs will be one of the government\u2019s key tools to harness private capital. Viet \nNam passed the Law of Public-Private Partnership, 2020 with advisory support from ADB and \nother development partners.11 The law\u2019s successful implementation will be instrumental in \nfurther integrating the private sector into Viet Nam\u2019s economic development, while conserving \npublic resources in a constrained fiscal environment and increasing the efficiency of public \nservice delivery. \n \n6.  Concurrently, the government plans to accelerate the reform of SOEs, which play a \nprominent  role  in  infrastructure  development,  including  in  the  energy,  transport, \ntelecommunication, and water sectors. Viet Nam started SOE reforms more than a decade \nago and has made good progress. In 2009, it unbundled Electricity Vietnam. In 2018, it \nestablished the Committee for the Management of State Capital to increase the oversight and \nefficiency  of  19  of  the  largest  SOEs,  many  in  infrastructure  sectors.  Presently,  it  is \nsystematically reducing financial support to SOEs, so that they are subject to market discipline. \nNotwithstanding,  SOEs  still  account  for  28%  of  GDP. 12  Therefore,  it  is  critical  that \ninfrastructure SOEs become more efficient and adopt operating standards that facilitate \nenvironmentally sustainable growth.  \n \n7.  Climate change. With carbon intensity that is almost triple the world average, Viet \nNam has high potential to introduce more sustainable growth models.13 In 2020, renewable \nenergy accounted for 57% of Viet Nam\u2019s energy mix14 but could reach 68% of generation by \n2030 without significantly increasing costs or compromising energy security.15 Vietnam Oil and \nGas Group (PVN), the country\u2019s second largest energy SOE, has expressed willingness to \nreform its strategy and to develop greener forms of energy production such as offshore wind \nand  liquified  natural  gas.  If  PVN  could  effect  a  strategic  reform  (para.  6)  to  deliver \nenvironmentally sustainable infrastructure, it would have downstream impacts throughout the \nenergy value chain. At a broader and economy-wide level, there are significant opportunities \nfor both the public and private sectors to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution \nand enhance climate resilience through adaptation and mitigation measures.  \n \n8.  Incomplete policy framework. To implement the government\u2019s strategy to close the \ninfrastructure deficit, Viet Nam seeks to address existing gaps in the policy framework, project \npreparation, and capacity. While the 2020 PPP law and its related decrees have established \nViet Nam\u2019s framework for PPPs, circulars and other supporting documents to implement the \nlaw are needed. Additionally, SOEs will need support to pivot to more environmentally friendly \nbusiness models and adopt best practices in social and environmental audits of infrastructure \nprojects. Finally, although an increased reliance on PPPs and SOE reform is important, they \ndo not address the constraints on every sector. A domestic credit rating culture backed by \nstrong institutions is vital to attract private domestic and international investments. However, \nViet Nam has yet to establish a successful credit rating agency (CRA) that can link the private \nsector to capital markets through corporate bonds, project bonds, and other instruments. While \nViet Nam has licensed two CRAs, public credit ratings remain limited. ADB, with support from \nthe Government of Australia, has supported an initial phase of developing the local credit \nrating market through publishing a report on the potential for global CRAs to invest in domestic \n \n10 Communist Party of Viet Nam. 2020.

Weak project selection and preparation. With the recent passage of the PPP law \n(para. 5), an immediate priority is to develop viable PPP projects that will attract the private \nsector. There have been recent examples where investors have declined to bid on PPPs \nbecause of structuring weaknesses. Given the volume of potential PPPs, project screening \nand structuring must be enhanced to ensure that the most promising projects are identified \nand prepared to international standards. These projects would then become early benchmarks \nthat further energize the PPP agenda. For both project screening and structuring, the G20 \nprinciples of Quality Infrastructure Investment, particularly the gender and environmental \naspects, need to be mainstreamed.17  \n \n10.  Limited capacity to implement the PPP and private sector development agenda. \nLeveraging the private sector for development is still a relatively new concept in Viet Nam and \ncapacity is lacking in general. Most of the expertise for PPPs and infrastructure planning is at \nthe central level. The more that this knowledge is diffused to municipalities and provinces, the \nmore local projects will be able to leverage the efficiency of PPPs. In addition, these reforms \nwill need to enlist the talents of all Vietnamese. Historically, infrastructure has been dominated \nby men. For example, women represent less than 10% of those employed in the construction \nand transport sectors.18 To increase their representation and to diversify and expand the talent \npool,  initiatives  are  needed  to  attract  women  to  the  infrastructure  sector  and  provide \nopportunities for professional growth to those already in the sector.  \n \n11.  Gender. Gender inequality is an issue that cuts across these three constraints (paras. \n8\u201310). While the Viet Nam Constitution, the Law on Gender Equality (2006), and other \nmeasures create an enabling environment for women to play an active role in the development \nof  the  private  sector,  rigid  gender  perceptions  and  stereotypes  limit  their  engagement, \nespecially in the infrastructure sector. One study found that 20% of job postings in Viet Nam \nincluded gender requirements, and for engineering vacancies, 99% of those with gender \nrequirements specified that  the  applicant should  be  male.19 Similarly,  while  it is  widely \nrecognized that women\u2019s experience of and needs from infrastructure are unique, policies and \ninfrastructure projects do not account for their perspectives in part because there has been \nminimal research on what is needed to make infrastructure more inclusive. Targeted capacity \ndevelopment initiatives to increase the participation of women in infrastructure as well as \ngender-responsive approaches to PPPs and private sector development are priorities.  \n \n12.  Development partner coordination. ADB has been closely coordinating with other \ndevelopment  partners  to  support  the  development  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  private  sector.  ADB \ncooperated with the World Bank and others in consolidating development partners\u2019 comments \non drafts of the PPP law and presented those comments on behalf of all the development \npartners to  members  of Viet  Nam\u2019s  National Assembly. ADB  is  also  the  co-chair  of  a \nstakeholder forum on PPPs that the Ministry of Planning and Investment sponsors. \n \n13.  ADB experience and lessons learned. The TA draws from lessons learned from \nearlier ADB projects in Viet Nam, including the Mekong Business Initiative20 and the Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership Support Project (P3SP),21 which were both completed in 2020. In P3SP, \nthe complex budgeting and the rigidity of public investment approvals in Viet Nam\u2019s Medium-\n \n16  ADB. 2020.

As \na loan, budgetary expenses for P3SP were required to be included in the MTIP and approved \nby the National Assembly, which caused delays and low disbursements. Under a TA modality, \nthe inputs to project concept preparation will not require approval from the National Assembly. \nThe TA also draws from ADB\u2019s experience in Viet Nam with SOE reform. The SOE Reform \nand Corporate Governance Facilitation Program closed in 2017,22 and its completion report \nrecommended a greater focus on preparing SOEs for nonsovereign borrowing.23 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: the private sector is transformed into a \ndriver of economic growth.24 The TA will have the following outcome: private sector\u2019s role \nexpanded in Viet Nam\u2019s gender-responsive and environmentally sustainable development. 25 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n15.  Output  1:  Policy  advice  on  public-private  partnerships  and  private  sector \ndevelopment delivered. First, this output will provide policy advice to formulate the necessary \ncirculars and other policy documents to implement the PPP law. Second, to enable access to \nfinancing for PPPs and other projects, the output will help Viet Nam to establish at least one \nsuccessful domestic CRA by training domestic CRAs that are able to partner with a global \nCRA;  helping  the  government  to  revise  Decree  88/2014/ND-CP,  which  regulates  the \nsupervision of CRAs; sponsoring seminars for capital market participants on the benefits of \ncredit ratings; and partially offsetting the costs of entities getting their first rating from a \ndomestic CRA. Third, the output will help at least two SOEs to conduct environmental audits \nof their corporate operations and of planned projects and provide advice on implementing the \naudit\u2019s recommendations. Seminars will then disseminate the lessons from these audits to \nother infrastructure SOEs. Fourth, the output will help PVN to prepare, through expert advice \nand consultations with leading international firms, a green energy transition strategy to move \naway from an exclusive reliance on fossil fuels, setting a precedent for other SOEs to follow. \nFifth, the output will prepare a study that will examine how Viet Nam\u2019s infrastructure can better \nserve  the  needs  of  women,  which  will  build  upon  other  ADB  studies  on  women  and \ninfrastructure.26  \n \n16.  Output 2: Pilot projects embedding Quality Infrastructure Investment principles \nconceptualized. This output will help the government to adopt the G20 Quality Infrastructure \nInvestment principles by applying them to screen PPP projects that are already in the MTIP. \nIt will identify those projects with the greatest potential to be successfully delivered as PPPs \nand provide inputs to support the government in preparing a project concept paper for one of \nthese screened projects. The inputs to the concept paper will preferably be for a project in the \nhealth sector, to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare funding, or a sector that \npromotes  environmental  sustainability,  such  as  waste-to-energy  generation,  waste \nmanagement, municipal water, or irrigation. This would help further the government\u2019s agenda \nto transition to a low-carbon economy and introduce green and climate-proofed infrastructure. \nThe inputs for project concept preparation will adhere to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)27 to ensure that it is environmentally sustainable, include appropriate mitigants to \n \n22 ADB. 2009.

To better link the preparation of infrastructure to the needs of \nwomen, the output will undertake a gender gap assessment of a government agency or SOE. \nTo implement their green energy transition strategy, this output will support PVN to develop a \nsustainable energy project. \n \n17.  Output  3:  Public-private  partnership  and  private  sector  development \ninstitutional capacities strengthened. This output will support at least one province or \nmunicipality  to  train  a  cadre  of  decision  makers  to  leverage  the  principles  of  Quality \nInfrastructure Investment to improve  competitiveness and resilience post COVID-19 and \nfacilitate sub-sovereign PPPs.28 It will also help women from both the public and private \nsectors to pursue careers in infrastructure and related technical fields by sponsoring an \nexecutive program for promising managers and an on-the-job paid internship program to \nencourage more young women to enter these fields. Three cohorts of 10 women each will \nparticipate in the executive and internship programs, respectively.29 For both programs, ADB \nwill work with a consultancy to (i) identify key public and private sector organizations that are \nwilling to participate, and (ii) prepare the programs that are expected to include training on \ndesigning,  evaluating,  and  implementing  infrastructure  projects  for  environmental \nsustainability, climate change resilience, gender inclusiveness, and other principles of Quality \nInfrastructure Investment.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $4,724,000 of which (i) $2,700,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of Canada and (ii) $1,900,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Government of Australia, both to be administered by ADB.30 The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s Viet Nam Resident Mission will administer the TA. The Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment will be the executing agency. It will also be the implementing agency for activities \nrelated to PPPs, SOEs\u2019 environmental audits, and the gender gap assessment. The Ministry \nof  Finance  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  support  for  domestic  credit  rating \nagencies.31  PVN will be the implementing agency for its strategic reform.32 The TA will be \nimplemented for 55 months, from June 2021 to December 2025.    \n \n20.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in the table.33 For part of the support \nto domestic credit rating agencies, two firms will be recruited through single-source selection. \n \n28 The selected municipality will additionally be invited to participate in RETA 6588: Creating Investable Cities in a \nPost-COVID-19 Asia and the Pacific\u2014Enhancing Competitiveness and Resilience through Quality Infrastructure. \nThis regional TA supports capacity building at the subnational level to implement municipal projects by (i) \nimproving capacity building for early-stage project preparation using Quality Infrastructure Investment principles; \n(ii) assessing and increasing creditworthiness to support infrastructure development; and (iii) identifying \nopportunities to raise more capital from the private sector, including through PPPs. \n29  There may be limitations on government ministries participating in the internship program, in which case the \nprogram would focus on state-owned enterprises and private companies. As a possible alternative, the internship \nprogram may also sponsor staff exchanges between women working in different governmental organizations. \n30  ADB is in discussion with donors about additional contributions to the TA.
