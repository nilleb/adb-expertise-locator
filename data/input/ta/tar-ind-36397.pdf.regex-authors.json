Most of the projects were integrated in nature, and \nseveral  important  lessons  have  emerged  during  implementation  of  these  integrated  urban \ndevelopment  projects.  Because  of  substantial  start-up  delays  and  slow  implementation,  it \nbecame necessary to look into ADB's urban sector operations in general and initiate major \nrealignments in coverage of urban subsectors as well as arrangements for improved project \nimplementation, if required. For this purpose, advisory technical assistance (TA) for the Urban \nSector Review and Strategy was included in the 2003 program to evaluate ADB's past and \nongoing operations in the urban sector and reengineer ADB's approach in future interventions to \nensure sustainability of urban sector investments.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n2.  India is one of the largest borrowers of ADB. During the last decade and a half, ADB has \nbeen actively involved in supporting the Government\u2019s reform initiatives through loan assistance \ntotaling $11.5 billion and TA grants totaling $85 million. The bulk of past assistance was for \nenergy projects (35%), followed by projects in transport and communication (30%) and urban \ninfrastructure (12%). The new Country Strategy and Program for India presents an even more \nambitious program for 2003-2006 for a total of $7.5 billion, or approximately $1.9 billion per \nyear.  Urban sector projects will account for about 13% of the proposed loan pipeline.  \n \n3.  While ADB\u2019s assistance to India began in 1986, the first loan to the urban sector, \nnamely,  Karnataka  Urban  Infrastructure  Development Project,2 was approved only in 1995. \nInitially, the Government was reluctant to borrow for the urban sector because of India\u2019s lack of \naccess  to  Asian  Development  Fund  resources,  given  that  urban  projects  often  include \ncomponents  to  address  basic  human  needs  and  direct  poverty  reduction.  In  addition, \nsuccessive 5-year plans of the Government in the past stressed rural development in general \nand neglected balanced urban development because more than 70% of the population reside in \nrural villages. However, with the passing of the 74th Constitutional Amendment in 1992, the \nurban sector gained importance both politically and economically.  The potential of the urban \nsector  as  the  engine  of  economic  growth  was  also  clearly  recognized,  as  the  excellent \nperformance of the economy in the 1990s was largely due to the ability of the urban sector to \nattract investment and increase productivity. In fact, estimates of the contribution of urban areas \nto gross domestic product are in the order of 55-60%, well above the level of urbanization (28% \nin 2001).   \n \n4.  At present seven ADB-assisted urban sector projects are being implemented in India \nand the total financial commitment of ADB in these projects is close to $1.3 billion. Of the seven \nprojects, three are loans to national financial institutions for onlending to eligible borrowers in \nthe housing and commercial urban infrastructure sectors. The remaining four are integrated \nurban development projects for selected state and local governments to improve basic urban \ninfrastructure. The components in the integrated projects are multiple and range from water \n                                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 25 March 2003. \n2  ADB. 1995.

", "2     \nsupply and sanitation, urban roads, and slum improvement to providing public toilets, kitchen \nmarkets,  and  fire-fighting  equipment.  With  the  exception  of  the  Kolkata  Environmental \nImprovement Project, each project covers several towns, ranging from 6 in Karnataka Urban \nInfrastructure Development Project and Rajastan Urban Infrastructure Development Project to \n10 in Karnataka Urban Development and Coastal Environmental Management Project. The \nurban component is also an important part of the Gujarat Earthquake Reconstruction and \nRehabilitation Project (GERRP) to rehabilitate water supply and sewerage, roads, housing, and \npower distribution in 14 earthquake-affected towns.  \n \n5.  Integrated urban development projects are inherently complex, as they typically include \nmultiple sector investments for more than one urban area, along with policy reform, capacity \nbuilding, and governance and community participation components. Besides, implementation of \nurban projects tend to face more challenges due to the weak capacities of urban local bodies, \nthe multidisciplinary and interconnected nature of the works in the urban subsectors, and the \nreforms that are required to make the projects institutionally and financially sustainable. In \naddition, for executing agencies (EAs) and participating municipalities that are new to ADB-\nassisted projects, it takes time and intensive capacity building to make them fully familiar with \nADB\u2019s technical and procurement requirements. As most urban projects have a component for \nurban poverty reduction at the community level, EAs and participating municipalities must also \nlearn how to deal with the urban poor through nongovernment organizations and local slum \nleaders,  also  a  time-consuming  process.  All  these  have  contributed  to  delays  in  project \nimplementation and less than satisfactory performance of the ADB-assisted urban projects in \nthe initial stage.   \n \n6.  A number of lessons learned were reported through ADB\u2019s project review missions. The \nlessons cover all aspects of a project cycle from the design stage to project implementation.3 \nThe key ones follow. (i) Project design can be made simpler by focusing on large capital \ninvestments for basic services such as water supply, sewerage, and roads, and limiting the \nnumber of towns participating in the project, while the smaller revenue generating schemes \nsuch as marketplaces, sites and services, and commercial complexes can be managed by local \nbodies  out  of  their  own  funds  through  short-term  commercial  borrowings.  (ii)  Since  the \nsustainability of the assets created under the project depends on the level of ownership and \ncommitment to reform displayed by the local bodies, extensive interaction with the local bodies \nis required in the entire process of planning, design, and implementation. (iii) State governments \nshould be required to have a dedicated project management structure in place from the project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) stage and complete the advance actions for recruiting  \nconsultants  before  loan  effectiveness.  (iv)  Making  ADB's  standard  bid  documents  and \nprocedures mandatory will save several months of time taken for their review and approval. (v) \nThe local competitive bidding limit could be raised from the current $3 million to attract better \nlocal contractors and bring in efficiencies of scale of operation (vi) The project management unit \nmust  be  staffed  with  competent  and  experienced  personnel,  who  should  be  allowed  a \nreasonable  tenure  of  3-4  years.  (vii)  An  operational  manual  should  be  prepared  at  the \npreparatory stage itself, defining the role of each entity in the implementing framework and \ndelegating suitable powers, which should be followed strictly to avoid delays in decision making. \n(viii) An attempt should be made to integrate the poverty reduction components more closely \nwith ongoing government programs and traditional delivery mechanisms at the local level so as \nto maximize impact and improve sustainability.  \n \n                                                                 \n3 In addition, the Operations Evaluation Department has prepared seven project performance audit reports, two \nspecial evaluation studies, one impact evaluation study, and a technical assistance performance audit report in the \nurban sector. These reports are available on the ADB web site (www.adb.org/evaluation/reports). \n ", "       3 \n7.  As ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy will continue to support integrated urban development in \nselected states, it is important that lessons learned are passed on to ADB's new clients in the \nsector. ADB\u2019s role as a facilitator is therefore important in consolidating the lessons learned, \nproviding opportunities for the concerned states and municipalities to interact and learn from \neach other, and promoting better practices in project preparation and implementation.  ADB can \nspecially help its clients build a supportive network among themselves through which they can \nlearn from each other\u2019s mistakes, exchange views and share experiences.  \n \n8.  In the future, stand-alone interventions may be considered in the areas of (i) solid waste \nmanagement, (ii) water supply and sanitation, (iii) tourism development, (iv) urban transport, \nand (iv) urban land management and redevelopment. ADB\u2019s financial assistance, especially for \nthose outside the focus states, will be provided in exchange for an enabling policy framework to \nattract  investments.  At  present,  about  90%  of  the  investment  requirements  for  the  urban \ninfrastructure provision is not covered by budgetary provisions, leaving urban local bodies with \nthe responsibility for mobilizing financial resources from various sources, including market \nborrowing. While ADB will continue to assume a leading role in providing external assistance to \nthe sector, improving the creditworthiness of the urban local bodies in this context becomes \ncritical to meet the huge investment requirement, both backlog and new.  In this regard, ADB \nassistance can complement the recently announced initiatives of the Government to support \nurban sector reform at both state and municipal levels, namely, the City Challenge Fund, Urban \nReform Initiative Fund, and Pooled Financing Scheme. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of ADB\u2019s urban sector operations in \nIndia by assisting selected state and local governments to share the lessons learned from ADB-\nassisted urban projects, to help improve the design and implementation of future investment \nprojects, and to develop initial investment proposals for ADB's financial assistance. To achieve \nthis objective, the TA will provide the concerned state and local governments with opportunities \nto share their experiences and build a supportive network among them. The TA will also compile \nbest practices in urban management for replication in ADB-assisted urban projects in the future. \nFocus group discussions will assess the level of urban services in selected states and develop a \nframework for ADB's urban sector operations in India.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will comprise five parts: part A: sharing experience and building a supportive \nnetwork  among  the  selected  states  and  municipalities;  part  B:  improving  the  design  and \nimplementation  of  new  urban  development  projects  (scoping  and  predesign  of  urban \ndevelopment projects in selected states); part C: compiling best practices within India to apply in \nnew urban projects; part D: focus group discussions for stand-alone (against integrated) urban \ninvestment projects outside ADB\u2019s focus states; and part E: consolidating the findings and \ndeveloping a comprehensive framework for ADB's urban sector operations in India. \n \n11.  Part  A  will  promote  experience  sharing  among  the  selected  state  and  municipal \ngovernments that are directly involved in ADB-assisted urban projects. It will also cover those \nexpecting financial assistance from ADB in the future. The activities in part A will include \nparticipatory workshops to discuss lessons learned, site visits to other states and municipalities, \nbuilding a supportive network for key project implementation issues, and group discussions on \n   ", "4     \nurban policy and financing issues. The project manager will prepare a consolidated report on all \nthe activities in part A for the final dissemination workshop. \n \n12.  Policy discussions, technical support, and studies under parts B-E will be as follows:   \n \n(i)  Part B: Improving the design and implementation of new urban development \nprojects (scoping and predesign of urban projects in selected states)  \n(a)  Selecting states and municipalities for ADB assistance in the urban sector \n(b)  Selecting urban subsectors for investments \n(c)  Integrating urban governance reform in project design \n(d)  Simplifying implementation arrangements \n(e)  Ensuring  a  sense  of  ownership  of  the  project  and  sustainability  of \ninvestments \n \n(ii)  Part C: Best practices within India for urban management reform and improved \nservice delivery \n(a)  Computerization and electronic-governance \n(b)  Financial management and resource mobilization \n(c)  Urban poverty reduction and community participation \n(d)  Private sector participation \n(e)  Value-based education for sustainable delivery of municipal services \n \n(iii)  Part D: Theme papers for focus group discussions \n(a)  Tourism development \n(b)  Solid waste management \n(c)  Urban water supply and sanitation \n(d)  Urban transport \n(e)  Urban land management and redevelopment \n \n(iv)  Part E: Urban sector strategy: Consolidating findings and recommendations for \nADB's urban sector operations in India \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $606,000  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \nexchange of $65,000 and local currency of $541,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $480,000 to \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and $415,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The \nTA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The Government will \ncontribute the remaining local currency cost of $126,000 equivalent for counterpart staff inputs, \ncompilation of project data and surveys, and other logistical support for networking activities. \nDetails of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty Reduction (MOUDPA) will be the EA \nand will be responsible for overall coordination with ADB.  It will also provide administrative \nsupport to the consultants and will coordinate with concerned states if required. For effective \nimplementation, a TA steering committee, chaired by the joint secretary of MOUDPA, will be set \nup comprising representatives from the Planning Commission, Department of Economic Affairs, \nADB, and a reputable research institute in urban development. The steering committee will meet \nat least three times during the TA to review and monitor the implementation.  \n \n ", "       5 \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from September 2003 to August 2004. A \ndomestic  urban  development  specialist  (12  person-months)  will  be  appointed  as  project \nmanager, under the direct supervision of ADB, to administer all TA activities. At the end of the \nTA,  one  international  consultant  will  be  engaged  for  1.5  person-months  to  prepare  a \nconsolidated final report based on the outcomes of the networking activities, focus group \ndiscussions, studies, and reports prepared under the TA. Up to 30 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services will be provided to support the activities in part B. In addition, 10 domestic \nurban sector specialists will be engaged on a lump-sum contract basis to undertake studies \nunder part C (5 consultants) and part D (5 consultants). ADB will engage all consultants on an \nindividual  basis,  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Administrative support will \nbe  provided  to  the  project  manager  as  needed.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. Equipment purchased under the TA will be turned over to the EA \nupon  completion  of  the  project.  Equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nprocurement guidelines. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $480,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for the Urban Sector Review and Strategy, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.  \n \n \n   ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Indicators and Targets  Monitoring  Key Assumptions \nMechanisms \nGoal       \n       \nImproved effectiveness and  For the ADB-assisted urban  ADB\u2019s loan review  State and municipal \nefficiency of ADB\u2019s urban  projects to maintain   missions  governments will build \nsector operations in India  satisfactory or highly    sufficient capacity for \nsatisfactory ratings in the  Project performance  all phases of project \nproject performance report  reports  preparation and \nfor both implementation    implementation. \nprogress and the     \nachievement of development  Project completion  ADB will support \nobjectives.   reports  capacity building. \nPurpose       \n       \nAssist state and local  Advance consultation  Continuous dialogue  State and municipal \ngovernments (i) to review the  between ADB and  with the concerned  governments have a \nlessons learned from the ADB- concerned state and local  state and local  strong sense of \nassisted urban projects, (ii) to  governments on the project  governments  ownership. \nhelp improve the design and  design and implementation     \nimplementation of investment  arrangements before  Stakeholder   \nprojects, and develop initial  preparing PPTAs  discussions under the \ninvestment proposals for    TA \nADB\u2019s financial assistance     \n  Focus group \nInitial investment proposals  discussions under the \nprepared by the concerned  TA \nstate and local governments   \non their own initiatives.  \n \nComponents/Outputs       \n       \n1.

Domestic Urban Sector Specialists (up to 30 person-months for Part B)  \n \n2.  The  services  of  the  domestic  urban  sector  specialists  (financial  analysts,  project \neconomists, municipal and environmental engineers, etc.) will be required to assist the selected \nstate and municipal governments with the predesign and scoping of new urban development \nprojects for ADB assistance. The expertise required will be determined by the specific needs of \nthe concerned state and local governments and will be identified during TA implementation. It is \nestimated that up to 30 person-months of domestic consulting services will be provided to meet \nthe requirements of the new clients who will receive ADB financial assistance from 2004 to \n2006. Before the provision of a formal project preparatory TA, the technical support to be \nmobilized under the TA will help the concerned state and local governments to undertake rapid \nappraisal of the project concept and scope based on lessons learned from past and ongoing \nurban  projects  in  India.  In  addition,  the  consultants  will  review  best  practices  and  key \nimplementation issues summarized in ADB's evaluation reports that are available on ADB's web \nsites. Detailed Terms of Reference (TOR) will be prepared by ADB staff with the assistance of \nthe project manager once the project cities are identified.    \n \nC.

The consultants \nwill combine extensive literature review with field visits to prepare the report (50 pages of main \ntext supported by the field visit reports as appendix).  The reports will include recommendations \non how the experience of other cities in India can be successfully replicated for the benefit of the \ncities receiving ADB financial assistance. In addition, the consultants will review best practices \nand key implementation issues summarized in ADB's evaluation reports that are available on \nADB's web sites. Each expert will receive a detailed TOR at the time of engagement.   \n \nD.  Domestic Urban Sector Specialists (Part D) \n \n4.  Five domestic consultants will be engaged to prepare five theme papers for focus group \ndiscussions: (i) tourism development, (ii) solid waste management, (iii) urban water supply and \nsanitation,  (iv)  urban  transport,  and  (v)  urban  land  management  and  redevelopment.  The \nconsultants will be engaged under a lump-sum contract to prepare a stand-alone paper on each \ntopic.  In  the  past,  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector  operations  supported  mainly  integrated  urban \ndevelopment projects in focus states. The consultants will examine the possibility of broadening \nADB\u2019s urban sector operations to include multicities projects on one sector outside the focus \nstates.  Considering national priority as defined in 5-year plan documents and in consultation \nwith relevant central ministries and state governments, the consultants will propose sample \ninvestment projects in each subsector for ADB\u2019s financial assistance.  The projects may cover \nthe states that are not currently involved in ADB urban sector operations. There must be \nsufficient justification for selecting states and cities for sample projects. In this regard,  ADB \nassistance can complement the recently announced initiatives of the Government to support \nurban sector reform at both state and municipal levels, namely; City Challenge Fund, Urban \nReform Initiative Fund, and Pooled Financing Scheme. The consultants will finalize the paper by \nincorporating recommendations from the focus group discussions.  \n \nE.
