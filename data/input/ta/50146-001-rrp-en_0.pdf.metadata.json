THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $80,000,000 equivalent in United States (US) dollars and euros to Electric Networks of \nArmenia CJSC (ENA) for the Distribution Network Rehabilitation, Efficiency Improvement, and \nAugmentation in Armenia.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n2.  Project identification. Since the start of the 21st century, Armenia\u2019s energy sector has \nundergone a series of reforms that have significantly improved its performance. The reforms \ninvolved the unbundling of a vertically integrated electricity subsector and the privatization of \npower and gas distribution networks and of most generating companies.2 However, the power \ndistribution network was largely neglected and suffers from the effects of poor and irregular \nconstruction and maintenance work undertaken in the 1990s [Confidential information deleted]. \nDistribution assets in the two largest cities of Yerevan and Gyumri are almost fully depreciated. \n \n3.  Following financial difficulties in 2015, ENA (which is privately owned and the only \nelectricity  distribution  company  in  Armenia)  was  purchased  by  Liormand  Holdings  Limited \n(Liormand) from an affiliate of Inter RAO UES (Russian company). The new investor is in the \nprocess of upgrading the company\u2019s management and operations to bring them to international \nstandards. Before the ownership change in 2015, there were public protests because of the \nworsening quality and reliability of ENA\u2019s service at a time when tariffs were being increased. The \nGovernment of Armenia supported the change in ownership on the understanding that ENA would \nbe modernized and managed more efficiently. ENA\u2019s proposed 5-year investment program is the \nfirst step in this planned transformation and has been approved by Armenia\u2019s Public Service \nRegulatory Commission (PSRC). ENA is seeking the support of multilateral development banks. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment will be jointly financing the project, which commenced in 2016 and is expected to \nbe completed by 2020. \n \n4.  Project design. Under the new management and ownership, ENA launched the project \naimed at (i) improving the quality of the distribution network and services of its multisite operations \nacross the country; (ii) reducing electricity losses and operational expenses; (iii) improving \ntechnical  maintenance  and  safety  conditions;  (iv)  modernizing  the  metering  system;  (v) \nrehabilitating,  reinforcing,  and  augmenting  the  distribution  network;  (vi) connecting  new \ncustomers; and (vii) introducing international standards of management3 and an automated \ncontrol system. This is expected to directly improve profitability, while keeping tariffs stable. The \nproject has the following key components: \n \n(i)  Network rehabilitation and reinforcement [Confidential information deleted]. \nOutdated equipment and lines will be rehabilitated. The accumulated depreciation \nof  existing  equipment  ranges  from  66%  to  92%  for  most  categories,  which \nindicates the age of the equipment. Much of these will need to be replaced and \n                                                \n1  CJSC = closed joint stock company is a legal entity, commonly found in the former Soviet Union, whose shares are \ndistributed among a limited number of shareholders with limited liability. \n2  ADB. 2014.

This component will \nalso include the reconstruction of the 0.4 kV, 35 kV, and 110 kV distribution \nnetworks, as well as electric network improvement in apartment buildings. \n \n(ii)  Special projects [Confidential information deleted]. Investments to reduce the \nelectricity voltage deviations that exceed permitted limits will enhance the quality \nof supplied electricity and reduce network losses. \n \n(iii)  Substation  reconstruction  and  network  augmentation  [Confidential \ninformation deleted]. With the rapid expansion of the Yerevan city center and the \nconstruction of many new buildings, ENA implemented interim measures to cope \nwith the expansion. Investments related to the connection of new customers \naccount for 81% of the investment. In addition, ENA plans to reconstruct and \nupgrade three important substations. \n \n(iv)  Automatic meter reading [Confidential information deleted]. The expansion and \nimprovement of ENA\u2019s automatic electricity metering system, mainly in the 0.4 kV \nand 6/10 kV networks (including more than 250,000 meter installations for end \nconsumers), is being planned. The investment will allow a more efficient flow of \nelectricity and fewer power outages. The installation of automatic recording and \ncontrol systems will allow ENA to reduce commercial losses and manage systems \nmore efficiently. \n \n(v)  Vehicles and special machinery [Confidential information deleted]. ENA plans to \npurchase maintenance vehicles and machinery required for network operations \nand maintenance. \n \n(vi)  Other investments [Confidential information deleted]. The introduction of an \nautomated control system and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \nstandards of management will modernize overall planning and control functions as \nwell as customer interface. This component includes the purchase of office and \ntesting equipment, as well as the reconstruction of the administrative building. \n \n5.  Borrower. As the sole and exclusive licensee for the distribution of electricity in Armenia, \nENA is responsible for the maintenance and augmentation of the distribution network and is \nengaged in the purchase and regulated distribution of electricity. It is also the sole and exclusive \npurchaser of electricity in Armenia. With 7,136 employees, ENA is the largest employer in \nArmenia.  ENA  owns  and  operates  8,793  110  kV,  35  kV,  and  6/10  kV  substations  and \ntransformation stations; 261 distribution stations; 31,980 kilometers of overhead distribution lines \nand underground cables; 193 110 kV transformers; and 382 35 kV transformers.4 ENA has \n990,000 electricity meters (including 360,000 in Yerevan and 45,000 in Gyumri) to measure \nelectricity consumed.5 \n \n6.  ENA\u2019s customers are the entire population of Armenia: household annual consumption \nrepresents about 35% of electricity consumption; large customers (i.e., industry, transport, and \nwater supply and irrigation) account for about 30%: and the remaining 35% are public entities and \n                                                \n4  Tetra Tech. 2017.

The project contributes to government goals of energy independence and energy \nefficiency.8 \n  \n11.  Outcome. The outcome will be improved private sector electricity distribution in Armenia, \nprimarily characterized by lower distribution losses of 8.0% by 2021, compared with 9.7% in 2016. \n \n12.  Outputs. The output will be a rehabilitated network of 400 kilometers of upgraded \ndistribution lines, 900 upgraded transformers, 550 installed substations, and 250,000 automatic \nmetering devices installed for end consumers by the end of 2020. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n13.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nthe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which includes a focus on private sector development and \noperations, as well as infrastructure development.9 ADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with its \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Armenia,  2014\u20132018,  which  supports  energy  security  by \ndiversifying  energy  sources  and  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  electricity  transmission  and \ndistribution networks (footnote 2). \n \n14.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, particularly with one of its three pillars\u2014maximizing access to energy \nfor all. The project will support the installation of modern transmission and distribution systems to \ntransmit electricity efficiently from generation facilities to consumers, including the upgrading of \nexisting systems to reduce technical losses.10 \n \n                                                \n6  United States Agency for International Development. 2016.

ENA is a regulated distribution company and has been awarded the sole right to distribute \nelectricity in Armenia. Table 3 summarizes the main implementation arrangements that determine \nENA\u2019s revenues and the implementation of the investment program. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The Ministry of Energy Infrastructure and Natural Resources governs the \npower subsector. The Public Services Regulatory Commission (PSRC) is \nan independent regulatory body that regulates tariffs, licenses, service \nstandards, and trade provisions for companies in the power subsector. \nThe Energy Law, 2001 of Armenia is the main legislation for the power \nsubsector. The Electric Networks of Armenia (ENA) received a license to \ndistribute electricity in Armenia for an unlimited period. ENA\u2019s tariff is \napproved by PSRC as regulated in the Energy Law. The tariff regulation \nand ENA license set out the basis for calculating the necessary revenue \nrequired by ENA and this includes the permissible profit earned by ENA. \nProcurements carried out by ENA are subject to the requirements of the \nProcurement Law, 2005.  \nManagement  ENA has a six-member management team that is led by Karen \nHarutyunyan, the general director who is supported by a director in charge \nof each of the following functions: (i) finance and economy; (ii) technical; \n(iii) sales; (iv) security and control; and (v) general operations. ENA is \nmanaged by a team of professionals with strong industry background. \nImplementation period  Asian Development Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment funding for the implementation of the investment program \nwill be drawn over 4 years in four tranches. \nOperations arrangements   \nRevenue structure  The industry regulator, PSRC, determines the revenue that ENA earns. \nENA\u2019s regulated revenue is an aggregate of several components, which \nincludes the cost of purchased power (including generation, transmission, \nand system operation costs); ENA\u2019s operating and maintenance costs; \ndepreciation of ENA\u2019s regulated asset base; allowance for uncollectable \nreceivables; and a reasonable economic return on ENA\u2019s regulated asset \nbase. \nOperation and  Management of operations and technical aspects related to ENA\u2019s \nmaintenance  distribution network are undertaken by the employees of ENA. ENA has \nseparate departments that manage budgeting and planning, technical \nmanagement, and safety and inspections. ENA prepares demand \nforecasts and establishes its strategic development plans and operating \nand capital expenditure budgets based on these forecasts. \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, will \nbe reported by ENA. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "5 \nF.

ADB\u2019s proposed assistance comprises a loan of up to $80,000,000 equivalent in US \ndollars and euros to ENA from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n20.  ENA\u2019s investment program merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i)  ADB is filling a critical market gap by providing long-term funding which is not \navailable in the local market. \n(ii)  The proposed assistance will demonstrate ADB\u2019s confidence in ENA\u2019s financial \nstability which forms the foundation of Armenia\u2019s energy sector.  \n(iii)  ENA\u2019s environmental and social responsibility will be enhanced through ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement. \n \nC.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory B for the environment and involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous \npeoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the investment plan are generally site-\nspecific, reversible, and mostly associated with decommissioning and installation activities. These \ntypically include issues on occupational and community health and safety, noise and vibration, \nsoil erosion due to soil excavations, and management of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. \nManagement measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts will \nbe incorporated in the operational procedures of ENA and in the safeguard reports and plans of \nnew facilities.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n ", "6 \n27.  Involuntary resettlement impacts are not expected to be significant as reconstruction and \nrefurbishment will be carried out within the existing footprints of the facilities, without need for \nadditional land acquisition. New facilities such as substations and transformers, if required, will \nbe located on government lands after obtaining the required permission from the local authorities. \nThe due diligence confirmed that ENA does not typically implement any projects that involve \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or  land  acquisition  and  selects  alternate  suitable  locations  on \ngovernment lands. ENA will establish screening and categorization procedures for environment \nand involuntary resettlement impacts as part of its environmental and social management system \n(ESMS), prepare and implement safeguard documents and plans, as required, and in accordance \nwith the Safeguard Policy Statement. Category A subprojects for environment and involuntary \nresettlement impacts are unlikely under the investment program given the nature of ENA\u2019s \noperations and the scale of the facilities proposed. The investment program is unlikely to trigger \nimpacts on Indigenous Peoples (IPs) as there are no known IPs, as per Safeguard Policy \nStatement definition, in Armenia.  A grievance redress mechanism will be adopted to address \ninternal  and  external  stakeholder  grievances.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with \naffected people will be conducted following ADB requirements. ENA has committed to strengthen \nits institutional capacity to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts. \n \n28.  The Lenders\u2019 consultant conducted a corporate audit on ENA\u2019s current ESMS and its past \nand current performance against the objectives, principles, and requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The audit showed that while ENA is currently working on the implementation of \nfive ISO standards (including ISO 14001), the existing procedures are mainly established to \naddress national requirements. The Lenders\u2019 consultant developed a corrective action plan, which \nENA has agreed to integrate into its corporate ESMS. The ESMS will (i) formalize an internal \nsystem  that  outlines  ENA\u2019s  environmental  and  social  policies;  (ii)  establish  a  screening, \ncategorization,  safeguard  planning,  and  review  procedure  for  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  of  all  facilities  under  the  investment  program;  (iii)  rationalize  the \norganizational structure and staffing to manage environmental and social safeguard concerns; \n(iv) conduct continual training and capacity-building activities; and (v) expand monitoring and \nreporting regimes. These will be included in the legal agreement between ADB and ENA. \n \n29.  ENA  will  comply  with  Armenia\u2019s  Labor  Code,  2004  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with internationally recognized core \nlabor standards.11 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws, \nand (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will be \nconducted following ADB requirements (footnote 20). \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n30.  ENA was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
