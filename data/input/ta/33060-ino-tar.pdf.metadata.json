This technical  assistance  (TA) has been designed  to assist the Government  of Indonesia\nwith initiating  and sustaining  reforms  in its public expenditure  management  (PEM)  system.  The\n:t\ncurrent  system  is not well  suited  to the  rapidly  changing  external  environment.  With  the strong\n1\nf. and rapid push toward  fiscal and administrative  decentralization,  reforms  will be badly needed to\nenable  the  Government  to  effectively  confront  the  challenges  to  public  finance  that  the\n}.\ndecentralization  is bound to bring. Cognizant  of these problems,  the Government  has requested\nT A  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  guide  PEM  reforms  at  the  central\ngovernment  level.1\n2.

BACKGROUNDA ND RATIONALE\n3.  In September 1998, the Government requested ADB assistance for its efforts to improve\ngovernance and combat corruption.5 In response, ADB prepared an anticorruption action plan\nfor Indonesia based on its Anticorruption Policy Paper.8 ADB Management approved the action\nplan on 21 December 1998. A number of components of the action plan pertain to activities\ndesigned to promote a more efficient, transparent, and accountable public administration.\n.\n4.  ADB's policy on governanceh as identified four areas in public sector management of .\nparticular importance to ADB operations: (i) strengthening mechanisms for policy formulation,\ncoordination, and implementation; (ii) public financial management reform (including revenue\nand  expenditure  aspects);  (iii)  civil  service  reform;  and  (iv)  strengthening  accountability\nmechanisms. Given the critical role of public financial management in facilitating  (i), (iii), and\n(iv), a country's public expenditure management system must be adequately sound for public .\nsector reforms to bear fruit. This consideration becomes even more significant in the context of\n.\ndecentralization where  issues of intergovernmental relations and transfers  create an added ,\nlayer of complexity.T  hus, an in-depth study on Indonesia's public expenditure management .\nsystem  and  the  implications  of  the  new  decentralization  push  was  included  as  a  major i\ncomponent of the action plan. The TA   will implement this component of the action plan.\n!\ni\n.\n1  The TA was first listed in the ADB BusinessO pportunities in August 1999.\n2  Loan  INO  1620: Financial  Governance  Reforms: Sector Development  -  Capacity  Building  for  Financial 1\nGovernance, for $50 million,a pprovedo n 25 June 1998.\n3  Loan INO 1677: Community and Local Government Support Sector Development Program, for $200 million,\napproved on 25 March 1999.\n~  There are three Technical Assistance grants: (i) Capacity Building to Support Decentralized Administrative\nt\nSystems;  (ii) Capacity  Building  for Setting  Up Distrid  - Level Financial  and Budgetary  Systems;  and (iii) Capacity\nBuilding  for Participatory  Planning,  Monitoring, and Evaluation.\n5  Bank  assistance  to the  internal  audit  agency,  BPKP,  for developing  an  a/:'ti-corruption  strategy  preceded  this I\n.\nt request  and is a tranche  condition  for the FGRSDP.\nPolicy paper was approved by the Bank's Boardo f Directorso n 2 July 1998. .\n6 \n~", "2\n5.  Economic and  sector  work  has  identified  some  key  problems  in  Indonesia's  PEM\nsystem.7 Budgetary resources are not being allocated appropriately or are being diverted to\nother  uses. A  recent  World  Bank  report  on  the  Indonesian  civil  service  indicates  that  a\nsignificant portion of the development budget is being used to compensate civil servants when\nin fact all compensation should come from the recurrent budget.  Allocations for operations and\nmanagement  have  fallen  behind  levels  needed  to  maintain  capital  structures.  Moreover,\ncontingent liabilities of the public sector have not been systematically accounted for. These\ndeficiencies will soon be compounded by the demands imposed by decentralization. There is\nthus a need to conduct a diagnostic study of the country's PEM system and to build some ,\ninternal  capacity within  Government  to  undertake  the  requisite  assessments,  recommend\nremedial measures, and guide reforms.\nIII. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE '\\\nA. Objectives\n6.  The TA will help develop the Government's internal capacity to guide PEM reforms (TA\nframework in Appendix 1). The TA will be a joint undertaking of a field based study by an ADB\nteam, ielected  Government officials, and Indonesian academics.  The TA will lay part of the\nfoundation  for  establishing  a  sustainable  mechanism for  supporting  capacity  building  and\nreforms in PEM.\n7.  The TA   has four closely linked objectives. First, through the diagnostic  study, it will\nproduce  an  informative  analysis  of  Indonesia's  PEM  system,  especially  as  it  relates  to\ndecentralization,  and  draw  implications  of  different  institutional  arrangements  for  the\nGovernment  to  evaluate.  Because  of  the  Government's  strong  interest  and  focus  on\nimplementing fiscal and administrative decentralization, the TA will analyze the implications of\nproposed  implementation  procedures  and  regulations  for  the  recently  passed  laws  on\ndecentralization8  for the management of public expenditures, especially on how they might\nimpinge on public expenditure outcomes. Further, based on the  analysis, the  TA will  offer\nalternative arrangements for the design of implementation procedures, again emphasizing on\nthe decentralization dimension, that support rather than detract from desired public expenditure\noutcomes.\n8.  Second,  the  TA  will  help  build  the  Government's  internal  capacity  to  (i)  guide  PEM\nreforms,  including  in  particular  mechanisms  to  support  fiscal  decentralization;  and  (ii)  assist\nother Government  agencies  implementing  such reforms.  Given  the growing  demands  for reform\nand  the  vigorous  thrust  towards  decentralization,  the  Government  will  eventually  have  to\naddress  the  need  to  reform  the  public  expenditure  management  system  and  thus  will  need ,\nofficials  who  can  help  guide  these  reforms.  The  T A  will  provide  agency  personnel  with  the\nrequisite  analytical  tools  by  (i) engaging  professional  agency  officials  in the  preparation  and\ncompletion  of the  study,  (ii)  providing  funding  for  participants  to  attend  an  intensive  training\ncourse  in PEM, and (iii) involving  the participants  as active  resource  persons  in the national  and\nregional  workshops  designed  to  present  the  study's  findings.  A  critical  first  step  in capacity\nbuilding  will thus be achieved  through  formal  course work and tightly related  on the job training.\nThe World Bank conduded a civil servicea ssessmentf or Indonesiaa nd recentlyc ompleteda  public expenditure\n. review.\nLaw 22/1999o n Local Governmenat nd Law 25/1999o n Central-FiscaBl alance.", "3\n9.  Third,  by  engaging  intensively  and  including  select  Government  officials  from  the\nMinistry of Finance (MOF), National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and  Ministry\nof Home Affairs (MOHA), the  TA will help build across these three agencies a network of\ntechnical staff, i.e. .change  agents,\" who will  have a common framework  of  understanding\npublic expenditure management and the implications of decentralization. The creation of this\nnetwork will help support public sector reforms. The inclusion of two academics will help pave\nthe way for the development of a parallel network in civil society through the launching of locally\noffered workshops.\n10.  And fourth, through a seminar and workshops, the TA will expose Government officials\nfrom key ministries to the linkages between PEM and decentralization and to the implications of\npossible implementing regulations for decentralization for public expenditure outcomes. This\nexposure will facilitate informed discussions on both the PEM system and the implementing\nregulations for decentralization and help pave the way for needed reforms.\nB.\nScope\n11.  The  T A  has  been  structured  into  five  components:  (i)  an  initial  two-day  seminar  in\nJakarta  to start  a diagnostic  study  of  PEM;  (ii) the  diagnostic  study;  (iii)  an intensive  training\ncourse  held outside  Indonesia;  (iv) two dissemination  workshops,  one national  and one regional;\nand (v) an action plan for the next steps.\n12.  The first day of the initiating seminar will be open to all agencies to expose officials in\nrelevant agencies to the concepts of an outcomes-based PEM system, the TA structure, and\nexamples of PEM issues. On the second day, an overview of the TA   process, organization and\ndiagnostic tools will be provided to key officials in the participating agencies, focusing on the\nneeds of ten selected working-level Government civil servants who will participate actively in\ndiscussions and in the completion of the diagnostic study.8 A two week mission to initiate the\ndiagnostic study will commence immediately after this seminar.  The mission will consist of 5\nADS team  members (staff plus consultants) and will  be  supported by the  10 Government\nparticipants.  The mission will include a visit to one of the regions and, within the region, to\n10 \none of the provinces.\n13.  A diagnostic study to assess the Indonesian PEM system and the implications of\ndecentralizationf or the PEM system, will be undertakenw  ith the participationo f the 10 civil\nservants.T  he study will be divided into five sections:( i) maintaininga ggregatef iscal discipline;\n(ii) enhancinga llocativee fficiency;( iii) promotingi ncreasedo perationale fficiency;( iv) issues in\nbudget execution;a nd (v) implicationso f decentralizationG. overnmento fficialsw  ill be assigned\nto each of these sectionso n the basis of their ministeriala ffiliationsa nd job responsibilitiesT. he\nfirst three sections (i-iii) deal with upstream budget issues and (iv) with downstreamb  udget\nissues.A  n initial draft of the study will be completedd uring the mission.\n14.  The intensive training course will provide the 10 Government participants and 5 high\nranking officials from the key ministries with an intensive course on PEM to be offered by the\nADB Institute. The course will be given at ADB Institute in Tokyo and will last approximately\nseven days.\nAlthOugh the number of officials  is small relative to what  may be needed to  meet capacity  building\nrequirements, the T A is designed to develop the hard core expertise that the reform effort needs.\n10 Two professional staff members at the World Bank resident mission in Jakarta will be joining the Bank team\nfor the planned mission and the completion of the Study. An Intemational Monetary Fund official based as\nan adviser to the Ministry Of Finance will participate in the initiating seminar.", "4\n.\n15.  A national-level and a regional-level workshop for Government officials will be held to .\npresent the findings of the study. The workshops will be hosted by the Agency for Financial and\nMonetary Analysis  (AFMA)  and  respective  regions,  and  managed  by  the  10  Government\nparticipants, who will playa  prominent role in the presentations.\n16.  The TA team and the AFMA will assess further capacity building needs at the national\nscale. With the assistance of the team, AFMA will prepare an action plan outlining the next\nsteps. The findings will be incorporated into a medium term program that (i) lays out goals at ,\neach phase, and (ii) identifies a cluster of possible activities in each phase.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing  Plan\n~\n17.  The  total  TA  cost  is estimated  at  $282,000  equivalent,  including  $222,000  in foreign\nexchange  cost and $60,000  in local  currency  equivalent.  The total foreign  exchange  costs  and\n$3,000  equivalent  of local costs will be financed  on a grant basis from the Asian  Currency  Crisis\nSupport  Facility  (ACCSF),  funded  by the  Government  of Japan.  The  Government  will  finance\n$57,000  of the  total  cost  of  the  TA.  Appendix  2  provides  details  of  the  cost  estimates  and\nfinancing  plan.\n(.\nD.  Implementation  Arrangements\n18.  AFMA  of the MOF will  be the  Executing Agency for the TA  . AFMA,  which  has the\nrequired expertise in public finance, will be responsible for identifying the 10 participants: 3 from\nAFMA-MOF,  2 from  BAPPENAS,  1 from  MOHA, 2 from the  regions  (to  be  nominated by\nMOHA), and 2 from local academe. At least one of the two officials from AFMA-MOF will come\nfrom a unit dealing with decentralization and regional issues and another from a unit concerned\nwith central budget processes. The same criterion will apply to the selection of participating\nofficials from BAPPENAS.\n19.  The individuals must meet the following selection criteria:\n(i)  rank of Echelon II or III, or equivalent functional standing,\n(ii)  Master-level preparation in finance and planning related fields,\n(iii)  sufficient English proficiency to absorb material and communicate,\n(iv)  be involved in relevant work and likely to gain greater responsibilities in PEM,\nand\n(v)  able and willing to  become part of the nucleus for the dissemination of PEM\ncapabilities.\n,\n20.  The two regional  level officials  will be drawn  from the selected  province.  district  or city.\nThe regional  officials will serve to establish  the necessary  links with the local government  unit to\n\"\nfacilitate  the diagnostic  work and the subsequent  workshop  for the presentation  of the findings.\n21.  In addition to these eight officials, two instructors from universities delivering the regional\nfinance course (Kursus Keuangan Daerah) for government officials will be selected  by the\nAFMA to participate in the same activities as the core eight officials. The university-based\ninstructors will give particular attention to the training needs of regional officials concerned with\nPEM functions. They will assist in designing possible follow-up capacity building measures,\nparticularly in terms of training (encompassing also the training delivery system).", "5\n22.  These 10 individualsw  ill participatei n every componento f the TA, includingt he mission\nto  initiate the study. Their participation will create significant internal capacity within the\nGovernmentt o support PEM reforms and, in that context, provide much-neededg uidance for\nthe implementationo f the two decentralizationla ws.\n23.  The  ADB  Institute  has  agreed  to  develop  the  intensive  training  course  in  public\nexpenditure management (component four) with technical support and advice from Programs\nDepartment (East). The course will include officials from several developing member countries\nincluding Indonesia and will be used as a pilot for a training of trainers program on PEM which\nI ADB Institute intends to develop as a regular offering. The 10 participants in this project will\nattend this course, which will be held in Tokyo.\n24.  Due to the exploratory  nature  of the TA and the  concomitant  importance  for combining\nprofessionals  with highly specific  skills and experience,  international  consultants  will be hired on\nan individual  basis in accordance  with the Bank's  Guidelines  On the Use of Consultants.  A lead\nconsultant  will  be recruited  to work  closely  with  and  be responsible  to the  mission  leader  for\ncoordinating  and managing  the T A. Three  other consultants  will be hired on an individual  basis\nto  cover  (i)  budget  formulation  and  monitoring  arrangements;  (ii)  budget  execution\narrangements;  and  (iii) institutional  arrangements  governing  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations.\nThe  \"M  will  be implemented  over  a period  of 7 months  and  will  require  a total  of  5 person-\nmonths.  The outline terms  of reference  for the consultants  is presented  in Appendix  3. The T A is\nexpected  to be completed  in December  2000.\nIV.  THE  PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the  Government of  Indonesia in an\namount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $225,000 for  the  purpose  of  Public  Expenditure\nManagement and the Implications of Decenb\"alization, and hereby reports such action to the\nBoard.\nI", "6\n.\n.\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n,\n,\n..\n\\\n~", "7\nt\nI\n.\n!\nl\nt\n1\n.\nf\nReference  in text: page 2, para. 6 t\nt\n.\n4\n},\ni", "8\n--\n.\nAppendix2 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'000)\nItem  Foreign  Local  Total .\n.\n-\nConsultants (All International)\na.
