An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken, and the summary is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will reduce rural poverty in 16 districts of southwest \nBangladesh. To achieve this objective, the Project will  increase \neconomic opportunities for the rural poor through participatory \nimprovement of sustainable rural infrastructure, social and gender \ndevelopment, and improved local governance in the project area. \nThe impact on poverty reduction will be achieved by (i) targeting \npoor areas; (ii) closely involving the poor and other stakeholders \nin prioritizing and planning subprojects for project assistance, and \nin maintaining rural infrastructure, while at the same time building \ntheir capacity; and (iii) indirect assistance in developing economic \nopportunities through partnership arrangements. \n   \nRationale  Efficient rural transport and supporting infrastructure, in particular \nimproved  access,  are  essential  for  poverty  reduction  and \neconomic development in Bangladesh. Past efforts in this area \nwere undertaken with external assistance, including that from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The Project will build on the \nexperience and lessons learned from the previous projects to \nprovide needed rural infrastructure improvement. The project area \ncovers the 16 districts of Khulna and Barisal divisions, which were \nselected  because  of  the  poverty  level  and  the  poor  state  of \ndevelopment of the road infrastructure. Improving the rural roads \nand supporting infrastructure will provide the rural population with \neffective communication and transport to markets and distribution \ncenters. These improvements will lay the foundation for better \neconomic opportunities and assist in reducing poverty. Another \npriority  is  continued  reform  and  strengthening  of  the  Local \nGovernment  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  and  capacity \nbuilding for agencies in the districts and the union councils to \nenable them to plan, manage, operate, and maintain their local \ninfrastructure. Private sector stakeholders such as bus operators, \ntraders, and rickshaw drivers will be consulted on rural transport \nneeds.  The  Project  will  use  the  information  for  planning, \nmanaging, and constructing infrastructure. Local participation will \nimprove the effectiveness of the Project, sense of ownership, and \nattention to infrastructure maintenance. \n   ", "iv   \nObjectives  The Project will assist the Government to reduce rural poverty \nthrough  sustainable  economic  growth,  rural  development,  and \nimproved infrastructure. This objective supports the Government\u2019s \ngoals  to  promote  economic  development  and  reduce  poverty \nthrough rural infrastructure development. \n \nThe  Project  will  (i)  improve  rural  roads;  (ii)  improve  rural \ninfrastructure  such  as  growth  center  markets,  boat  landings, \nferries,  and  union  council  office  complexes;  (iii)  improve  rural \ninfrastructure maintenance; (iv) strengthen LGED capacity and \nimprove  local  governance;  and  (v)  support  LGED  in  project \nmanagement. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $112.4 million equivalent \ncomprising foreign exchange of $30.1 million, and local currency \nof $82.3 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n  ADB  23.5  36.5  60.0  53.4 \n  Germany (KfW)  5.2  6.7  11.9  10.5 \n  Germany (GTZ)  1.4  3.6  5.0  4.5 \n  Government  0.0  34.0  34.0  30.3 \n  Local Government  0.0  1.5  1.5  1.3 \nBodies \n           \n \nTotal  30.1  82.3  112.4  100.0 \n   \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank; KfW = Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau; GTZ = \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit. \n   \n  The German Government has been requested to provide a grant \ntotaling about $11.9 million equivalent through KfW to finance \nproject activities in four districts and implementation consultants in \nKhulna  division.  The  German  Government  has  also  been \nrequested  to  provide  a  grant  of  $5.0  million  through  GTZ  to \nfinance the capacity building component. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The proposed ADB financing from ADB's Special Funds resources \nis  equivalent  in  various  currencies  to  Special  Drawing  Rights \n45,461,000 [$60.0 million]. The loan will have a maturity of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge \nof 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   ", "  v\nExecuting Agency  LGED, in the Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local \nGovernment, Rural Development and Cooperatives.  \n   \nImplementation  The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  an  appropriately  staffed \nArrangements  project management office (PMO), established by LGED at its \nheadquarters in Dhaka. A full-time project director will head the \nPMO. The project director will be directly responsible for overall \nproject implementation and coordination and will report to the \nchief engineer of LGED. The PMO will establish two zonal offices\u2013 \none in LGED\u2019s Jessore district office and one in LGED\u2019s Barisal \ndistrict  office\u2013each  headed  by  a  deputy  project  director.  The \ndeputy  project  directors  will  have  day-to-day responsibility for \nproject  implementation  activities  in  their  zone,  and  supervise \nproject-related  work.  A  project  steering  committee  will  be \nestablished  comprising  the  concerned  line  agencies,  local \ngovernment  bodies,  and  nongovernment  and  private  sector \nrepresentatives to provide  overall policy advice and direction in \nproject implementation. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement under the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Major items such as equipment and vehicles will be \nprocured through international competitive bidding. Civil works will \ncomprise  many  small  contract  packages  for  improving \ninfrastructure and facilities scattered over a large area. All civil \nworks  will  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  among  prequalified  local \ncontractors.  ADB  approved  advance  action  and  retroactive \nfinancing for Government recruitment of consultants. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will assist LGED in project implementation. \nTwo consulting services groups are required to facilitate project \nimplementation and to strengthen LGED capacity and improve \nlocal governance. The consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. \n   ", "vi   \nProject Benefits and  The  direct  and  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  Project  consist  of \nBeneficiaries  savings in vehicle operating costs on the improved feeder roads. \nThe  beneficiaries  are  the  various  road  users\u2013bus  and  truck \nowners  and  operators,  passengers,  cargo  owners,  and  the \npopulation in the area of influence in general, estimated to be \nabout  5.9  million  people,  about  50%  of  whom  are  poor. \nImprovements in growth center markets will allow more efficient \ntrading.  About  50,000  person-years  of  employment  will  be \ngenerated during the Project for local laborers to assist in road \nimprovement and maintenance, thereby increasing the incomes of \nthe rural poor. The project infrastructure will create about 84,000 \nperson-years of permanent employment, of which 30% will be for \nwomen. The Project will also improve access to basic education \nand  social  services  leading  to  long-term  economic  and  social \nbenefits to the poor. \n \nThe Project's overall economic internal rate of return is 22.8%. \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction by (i) enabling poor \npeople to participate in economic opportunities and to access \nsocial services, and (ii) creating additional economic opportunities \nfor  poor  people  by  stimulating  economic  growth.  Project \nbeneficiaries will comprise (i) poor people who will have increased \naccess  to  economic  opportunities  and  human  development \nservices because of improved rural infrastructure; (ii) people living \nin  the  16  districts  who  were  previously  unable  to  pursue \nemployment and other economic opportunities due to the long \njourney times; and (iii) companies, employees, consumers, and \ntransport operators in the region that directly and indirectly use \ngoods  and  services  transported  on  the  roads.  About  2,100 \nperson-years  of  road  maintenance  employment  for rural poor \nwomen will be created annually by the Project. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project has been carefully formulated to manage and mitigate \nrisks. Advance action will help expedite recruiting consultants to \nsupervise implementation. Risks from the use of local contractors \nto carry out most of the civil works despite their limited capacity \nhave  been  successfully  addressed  in  previous  ADB-financed \nprojects.  Participatory  processes  involving  stakeholders  at  all \nlevels will give a sense of ownership and minimize delays caused \nby lack of local involvement in decision making. Environmental \nand  social  processes  including  participatory  mechanisms \nintroduced for the Project will address issues of local sensitivity \nand minimize adverse effects. \n   \n \n \n \n ", "  vii \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project.1  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Bangladesh has an extensive road transport system comprising about 227,000 kilometers \n(km). The 4,890 km long primary road network of national and regional roads connects the main \ncities to the 64 districts and is administered by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD). The \nsecondary network includes feeder roads type A (FRAs) (connecting subdistricts2) comprising \n15,962 km. The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) of the Ministry of Local \nGovernment,  Rural  Development,  and  Cooperatives  (MLGRDC)  administers  the  22,991  km \nnetwork of feeder roads type B (FRBs) and rural roads type 1 (RR-1), with a total network of \n67,067 km.3 Responsibility for the 116,000 km local rural road network of types 2 (RR-2) and 3 \n(RR-3), is currently delegated to the union councils.4 5 \n \n3.  Road transport demand during the 1990s increased at 8.2% nationally, compared with \nthe average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of only 4.8%. Between 1975 and \n1997, the proportions of freight and passenger traffic using road transport increased from 35% \nand 54% to 63% and 73%, respectively. In the project area (Barisal and Khulna divisions), the \nannual growth in road transport was 4.5%. Passenger transport has shifted substantially from \nwater and rail to road. Better quality rural roads provide improved service levels in public \ntransport, improved comfort, less costly private trips, and vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings \nof 30-50% for all vehicles. With road network improvements, it is expected that the demand for \nroad transport will continue to increase. \n \n4.  Since  1993  the  Government  has  provided  maintenance  funds  to  LGED  from  the \nrecurrent  budget.  From  FY1998-FY2002,  the  Government\u2019s  allocation  for  LGED  road \nmaintenance  has  increased  by  12%  per  year,  from  $21  million  to  $31  million.  However,  \nmaintaining the existing and new road assets will require a 15% annual increase in funding. The \ngap in funding for maintenance requirements for LGED roads has expanded from 4% in FY1998 \nto 28% in FY2002, to maintain 20,693 km of improved roads. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  In 1984 the Government adopted a strategy for rural development. The new strategy \nemphasized the critical aspects of the rural development process\u2013agricultural development, \nimproved physical infrastructure, and income generation for the poor including one or more of \n                                                 \n1  Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was provided under ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh for preparing the Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project. Manila  \n2  Subdistricts (upazila) are local governments at the third level of administration after divisions and districts (zila). \n3  Of the total length of 22,991 km of FRBs, only 10,583 km, or 46% has been improved; only 10,110 km of a total \nlength of 67,067 km of RR-1, or 15%, has been improved. \n4  Rural roads comprise (i) FRBs, which connect growth center markets with the national road network or subdistrict \nheadquarters; (ii) RR-1s, which connect local markets and union headquarters with subdistrict headquarters or the \nnational road network; (iii) RR-2s, which connect villages and farms with local markets and union headquarters; \nand (iv) RR-3s, which are within villages. \n5  Union councils (parishad), are the next level of local government below subdistricts, and are the level where local \nelections are held every 5 years. ", "2 \nthe following elements: (i) develop physical infrastructure (all-weather FRBs to connect growth \ncenter markets), improve rural roads and span the gaps in roads to give rural people better \naccess to markets and services, and improve facilities at growth center markets to make trading \nmore efficient; (ii) develop irrigated agriculture, and minor drainage and flood control works; (iii) \nreduce  poverty  through  rural  infrastructure  maintenance  programs;  and  (iv)  implement \nproduction and employment programs for the rural poor. Developments in these four critical \nareas  are  introduced  in  rural  districts  to  complement  each  other  and  provide  synergistic \ndevelopment impacts to reduce poverty. \n \n6.  The  strategy  has  been  implemented  through  a  series  of  projects  that  focused  on \ndevelopment of road and market infrastructure implemented by LGED with external financing \nsupport (Appendix 1). Among them are the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed rural \ninfrastructure development projects (RIDP)-I, RIDP-II, and RIDP-III.6 The project completion \nreports for RIDP-I and II and the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) concluded that \nthe projects contributed successfully to the strategy, including employment for the poor through \nlabor-intensive  construction  methods.  The  Bangladesh  Rural  Infrastructure  Strategy  Study \ncommissioned in 1996, and lessons learned and impact evaluations from previous ADB and \nother externally-financed projects concluded that the 1984 strategy\u2019s market growth center \napproach (focusing on public investments in selected market growth centers) remained valid. \nWhile the design of past projects was assessed to be fundamentally sound, new projects have \nincorporated the lessons learned from previous projects. Using lessons learned from RIDP-II \nand III, the proposed Project seeks to build the capacity of the executing agency to use more \nparticipatory approaches, continue the successful use of local labor contracting societies for \nroutine maintenance to provide employment opportunities for destitute rural women, increase \nthe training and use of private sector contractors for road construction and maintenance, and \nsupport the Government\u2019s decentralization policy by increasing the roles and responsibility of \nlocal  governments  in  development  planning  and  implementation.  The  plan  for  the  future \ndevelopment of the rural infrastructure subsector is in Appendix 2. \n \n7.  RHD,  LGED,  and  subdistricts  and  union  councils  have  responsibility  for  rural \ninfrastructure development. FRAs and FRBs are essentially the same, and the Government has \nbeen considering the redefinition of classifications and management responsibilities between \nRHD and LGED. RHD continues to manage some FRBs and even RR-1s, while LGED has \nundertaken work on some FRAs. This system is not conducive to effective management of the \nsecondary  and  tertiary  road  networks.  ADB  and  other  aid  agencies  have  consistently \nrecommended that (i) RHD should manage the primary road network of national and regional \nroads, (ii) LGED should manage the secondary road network of feeder roads and RR-1s, and \n(iii) subdistricts and union councils should manage the tertiary network of RR-2 and RR-3 roads. \nImplementation of this management system will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of road \noperations in the country. \n \n8.  ADB and other major aid agencies have invested heavily in the rural infrastructure \nsector. LGED\u2019s annual average level of external project support through the 1990s was in the \norder of $140 million. As a result LGED now has a large improved road network to maintain, one \nwhich will soon double with the FRAs coming under its jurisdiction.

", "3 \nroads sector, LGED will need to maximize the use of its resources to maintain the road assets \nunder its control, and improve its planning and funding for road maintenance requirements. \n \n9.  Since its inception in 1984, LGED has continuously developed its capacity to implement \nprojects. LGED recently recognized the critical importance of involving local stakeholders in \nplanning,  implementing  and  subsequently  maintaining  rural  infrastructure,  but  the  TA \ninstitutional analysis identified a need for extensive training of LGED staff in participatory \napproaches. If LGED is to be effective in this respect, it needs to develop an internal capacity to \ninvolve and facilitate community participation in project planning and management, undertake \nenvironmental and social assessments, and plan resettlement. LGED is in the process of \nadopting a new organizational structure that is more relevant to maintenance and facilitation \nroles, and will assist the union councils to develop into effective units of local government. The \nProject  will  assist  this  transition  through  training  to  facilitate  the  organizational  change \nnecessary for LGED\u2019s new role. \n \n10.  Government policy has attached importance to creating efficient and effective local \ngovernment institutions for decentralized decision making within a participatory framework. \nUnion councils, being the administrative unit closest to communities, are targeted as the focal \npoint for promoting socioeconomic changes and infrastructure development in rural Bangladesh. \nThey are empowered to undertake revenue collection and local administration, and promote \nlocal  development.  Union  councils  receive  allocations  for  projects  through  the  central \nGovernment\u2019s annual development program, but are also vested with powers to raise revenues \nto  carry  out  their  functions.  In  reality,  however,  there  has  not  been  much  progress  in \ndecentralized governance at this level. The TA and other studies have concluded that most \nunion councils in the rural regions have very limited capacity to carry out their functions, and are \npoorly  equipped  to  provide  meaningful  development  planning  and  administration  for  their \nconstituencies. There is a need to strengthen the union councils and empower them to take \nmore responsibility for local service delivery. \n \n11.  The  Government  has  identified  2,100  of  the  estimated  8,600  rural  markets  in \nBangladesh  as  growth  center  markets  to  serve  as  focal  points  and  catalysts  for  poverty \nreduction  and  economic  and  social  development,  and  around  which  investment  in  rural \ninfrastructure would be concentrated. They are key locations for trade and commercial activities. \nImprovement of growth center markets is seen as a crucial element of the rural development \nstrategy. The operation and maintenance of growth center markets is not entirely transparent, \nparticularly the award of market leases. Because lease values have declined over the years, a \nGovernment regulation forces the lease values to be increased each year. While the concept of \ngrowth center markets appears sound as a strategy, new regulations to introduce greater \ntransparency and local control of market management are required. \n \n12.  The project area, totaling 35,000 square kilometers (km2), comprises 16 districts of \nKhulna  and  Barisal  divisions,  which  cover  24.1%  of  the  total  area  of  Bangladesh.  Their \npopulation of 22.6 million represents 18.4% of the country's population. The project area was \nchosen because of the extensive poverty and low level of development in the region. In the two \ndivisions, over 11 million people are poor. In 2000, 47% of the people were below the upper \npoverty line\u201340% in Barisal and 51% in Khulna. In the decade ending in 2000, mean per capita \nexpenditure increased by 2.1% annually in these divisions while the national average annual \nincrease was 2.4%. Only 39% of the FRBs and 30% of the growth center markets in the project \narea have been improved to all-weather standard, so there is considerable potential for further \ninvestment in rural infrastructure to reduce poverty. \n ", "4 \n13.  Improving physical infrastructure like roads, markets, and ferry crossings has a direct \npositive impact on the income of all categories of households living in the affected areas. \nEvaluation of the ADB-financed RIDPs and other projects has shown that these interventions \nwere  highly  effective  in  reducing  poverty.  Improved  roads  and  markets  helped  to  lower \nmarketing costs and VOCs, and improved overall access to public services (health, education, \nand agricultural extension) and economic opportunities. The poor specifically benefited because \nof the increased availability of goods and services at lower prices. The 2002 Bangladesh Public \nExpenditure Review confirms the positive impact of rural infrastructure improvement on poverty \nreduction. A project preparatory TA study7 also found that 75% of the poor had easier access to \nemployment and their incomes increased by 20% on average. \n \n14.  To identify the most suitable project interventions within the project area, 27 participatory \nmeetings at the local level were conducted during the TA. From these meetings, stakeholders \nalso identified issues associated with governance (particularly at the local level), risk mitigation \nand stakeholder participation during project implementation. The issues included the need to \nstrengthen the coordination and participation mechanisms of union councils and LGED, the \nneed for sustainable and independent local level funding, and the need for these interventions \nto be sustainable beyond the project implementation period. These contributions and lessons \nlearned have been incorporated into the Project\u2019s design. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n \n15.  The goal of the Project is to reduce rural poverty in 16 districts of southwest Bangladesh. \nTo achieve the objective, the Project will increase economic opportunities for the rural poor \nthrough  participatory  improvement  of  sustainable  rural  infrastructure,  social  and  gender \ndevelopment,  and  improved  local  governance  in  the  project  area.  The  impact  on  poverty \nreduction will be achieved by (i) targeting poor areas; (ii) closely involving the poor and other \nstakeholders, including women, in prioritizing and planning subprojects for project assistance, \nand maintaining rural infrastructure, while at the  same time building their capacity; and (iii) \nindirect assistance in developing economic opportunities through partnership arrangements. \nThe project framework is in Appendix 3. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n16.  The Project will (i) improve rural roads; (ii) improve rural infrastructure such as growth \ncenter  markets,  boat  landings,  ferries,  and  union  council  office  complexes;  (iii)  improve \ninfrastructure maintenance; (iv) strengthen LGED capacity and improve local governance; and \n(v) support LGED in project management. \n \n1.  Rural Roads \n \n17.  The Project will upgrade about 1,030 km of FRBs to bitumen-surfaced standard and \nconstruct bridges and culverts along them to provide all-weather access to rural growth center \nmarkets.8 Local stakeholders selected  the FRBs from lists compiled by LGED, through 27 \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Road Network Improvement and \nMaintenance. Manila. \n8  If the Government decides to revise road classifications and reallocate the responsibility of FRAs and FRBs to \nLGED, the total length of feeder roads to be upgraded by the Project may be reviewed during implementation. ", "5 \nparticipatory meetings held under the TA. Further participation will be required at the local level \nif changes are needed at the detailed project design and implementation stages. Bridges and \nculverts with a total length of 3,000 meters (m) will be constructed on project FRBs. After \nmeeting the requirements on these roads, bridges and culverts totaling a further 2,000 m will be \nbuilt on other FRBs and RR-1s.9 Women labor contracting societies10 will be used to improve \nroad shoulders, plant trees on roadsides, and maintain the roads. The women will be supported \nby nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to promote savings from their income, and to identify \nincome-generating  opportunities  using  the  savings  through  partnership  arrangements  with \nmicrofinance institutions and NGOs. The use of performance-based maintenance contracts with \nprivate sector contractors will also be encouraged with consultant support. \n \n2.  Rural Infrastructure \n \n18.  During the project detailed design and implementation stages, through participatory \nmeetings, local stakeholders will select from lists compiled by LGED 60 growth center markets \nand 50 boat landings to be improved under the Project. The growth center markets will also \ninclude sections for women. Growth center market management committees will be elected at \npublic meetings and will be responsible for ensuring that the growth centers are properly \nmanaged financially and physically. A limited number of small ferries will be built to improve \naccess in riverine areas. Management committees for the boat landings and ferries will be \nformed. New union council office complexes will be built in 99 unions to support efforts to \nimprove local governance. \n \n3.  Infrastructure Maintenance \n19.  Road maintenance will be improved under the Project through central level reform, \nimproved district operations, and assignment of increased responsibilities to the union councils \nfor maintenance of rural roads (RR-2 and RR-3). The Project will require the Government to \nclose the gap in funding for maintenance by providing sufficient funds to maintain all roads for \nwhich LGED is responsible. The Project will also support policy dialogue with the Government \non ongoing and proposed ADB projects11 and other externally aided projects, to establish a \nmechanism to fund road maintenance adequately, and on a permanent basis. \n \n20.  LGED maintenance cells at the central and district levels will be supported to improve \ntheir maintenance management systems and procedures. The project consultant will review and \nintroduce  improvements  to  LGED\u2019s  maintenance  operations  and  management  systems \ncurrently in place.12 Engineers have already been dedicated to maintenance duties at district \nand subdistrict levels and LGED\u2019s central and regional training units and consultants will train \nthem in maintenance operations. LGED presently undertakes routine and periodic maintenance \nusing a combination of in-house (mobile maintenance) units, labor contracting groups, and \ncontracts. There are no performance-based specifications for maintenance. With the support of \n                                                 \n9 An ongoing bridge replacement program, funded by the Government of Japan, covers 44 bridges that increase \naccess in the project area and is complementary to the project investments. \n10 Labor contracting societies comprise poor rural women with limited earning possibilities who carry out routine \nmaintenance on rural roads using basic hand tools and material supplied by LGED. \n11 ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Road Maintenance and Improvement Project. Manila; ADB. 2002. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of \nBangladesh for the Road Network Improvement and Maintenance Project. \n12 Pavement surface trials will be conducted in project areas to determine the optimum timing for periodic reseals. \nThe highway design and maintenance standards model will also be recalibrated to model conditions on rural roads \nin Bangladesh and used as a tool for LGED to plan and manage maintenance.  ", "6 \nthe project consultant, the Project will continue previous and current efforts in LGED and RHD \nto promote the coordinated development of performance-based maintenance using contractors. \nThe subdistricts and union councils will be responsible for maintaining rural roads (RR-2 and \nRR-3), and for operation and maintenance of growth center markets and, where appropriate, the \nadjoining  boat  landings  and  ferries.  To  increase  awareness  of  the  union  council's \nresponsibilities, the project consultants will train union council members and staff. \n \n4.  LGED Capacity Building and Local Governance \na.  LGED Capacity Building \n21.  LGED\u2019s staff will be strengthened by training them in topics such as decentralized and \nprivatized  maintenance,  procurement,  financial  management,  and  particularly  the  use  of \nparticipatory approaches to infrastructure planning, development, and maintenance. The LGED \nunits for road maintenance planning, and monitoring and evaluation will be strengthened with \nassistance from the project consultant. LGED will be supported in introducing organizational \nreforms to strengthen its capacity to undertake environmental and social assessments, and \nproject performance management and  impact monitoring. The need for further institutional \nreform will also be assessed. Under this component, the clear demarcation of responsibilities for \nroad construction and maintenance between RHD (national and regional roads), LGED (all \nfeeder roads and RR-1s), and union councils (RR-2 and RR-3s) will be approved, and LGED \nand union councils will be supported to undertake their new responsibilities. A uniform financial \nmanagement  system  and  uniform  procurement  procedures  will  be  introduced  in  LGED. \nConsultant support will be provided in implementing LGED\u2019s new gender strategy. \n \n22.  LGED staff require nontechnical training to meet the growing demand for them to \nperform the function of facilitators and social mobilizers. LGED community organizers will \nfacilitate the training of LGED staff and of communities participating in the Project. NGOs with \nsuitable capability will be engaged to provide social mobilization training and training for labor \ncontracting societies and women shop owners. Staff of LGED's training division will give labor \ncontracting society groups including women, technical training to maintain RR-2 and RR-3 roads \nin the project area. LGED staff will also be trained to prepare social and environmental impact \nassessments, screen subprojects for resettlement impacts, and prepare resettlement plans. \n \nb.  Local Governance \n23.  The Project will support the improvement of local governance by giving training in local \ngovernment  issues,  planning,  financial  management,  administration,  and  participatory \nmethodologies to all members (at least 25% of whom will be women) of the 899 union councils \nin the project area to a level where they can confidently provide efficient and effective local \ngovernance to their constituents. The members of 32 pilot union councils will receive more \nintensive training. Similarly the members and staff of the management committees of growth \ncenters, boat landings and ferries, and market trader associations will be trained to a level \nwhere they can confidently operate and maintain the infrastructure. \n \n24.  Union development coordination committees will be formed in 32 pilot union councils. \nThe members will be various stakeholders such as line agency staff, NGOs, and primary \nstakeholder  beneficiary  groups.  The  committees  will  introduce  a  coordinated  approach  to \nplanning and implementing subprojects to improve flows of microfinance, line agency services, \nand training to beneficiaries. The committees will be chaired by the union council chairpersons \nand  will  seek  to  align  the  programs  of  different  stakeholders  toward  improving  economic ", "7 \nopportunities for project beneficiaries in the 32 unions. New women union council members will \nreceive orientation training on their role as public representatives to make them more effective. \n \n25.  The subdistricts and union councils are responsible for managing and maintaining RR-2 \nand RR-3 roads, boat landings, and ferries, but the level of their expertise is low. ADB\u2019s RIDP-III \nhas provided a useful program to build the capacity of the union councils using national training \nspecialists. The Project will continue this program, using existing materials and experience \ngained to train members of the Project\u2019s 899 union councils and other stakeholders such as \ncommunity  organizers,  union  market  management  committee  members,  and  boat  landing \ncommittee members. Citizens\u2019 forums will be established in each of the 32 pilot unions to enable \nthe citizens to participate in planning and decision making for the development of the union. \n \n26.  A sense of ownership and sustainability of union councils would be enhanced if locally \ngenerated  funds  from  market  leases  could  be  retained  for  local  union  operations  and \nmaintenance rather than be redistributed by the Government, as is presently the case. Such a \nsystem will be tested in the 32 pilot union councils. The Project will support the implementation \nof the newly approved market management regulation, including revised market management \ncommittee membership with members from the union (including women). The Project will \nimplement new guidelines for the award and management of market leases. The potential for \ngenerating  incremental  funds  for  local  development  by  granting  union  councils  increased \nrevenue mobilization powers will also be piloted. Pilot projects of clusters of the 32 union \ncouncils will test the concept of pooling revenues from the growth center markets and making \nthe concerned union councils responsible for the use of the funds. The pilot projects will \nestablish a methodology for LGED to provide matching funds as an incentive to unions that \nperform well in increasing their resource mobilization. Reforms will be introduced to devolve \nadditional authority to union councils to increase revenue mobilization.13  \n \n5.  Project Management Support \n27.  The  Project  will  provide  LGED  with  the  resources  necessary  to  support  efficient \nimplementation and management of all project activities. The Project will provide incremental \nstaff  for  project  management,  including  implementation  supervision  at  the  field  level.  A \ncombination of international and domestic consulting services will be provided to support project \nimplementation management, and capacity building. \n \nC.  Special Features \n28.  The Project will improve local governance by training union council members in their \nroles  and  responsibilities,  and  support  a  pilot  program  to  facilitate  the  introduction  of \nparticipatory mechanisms for union-level governance. The Project will undertake pilot projects of \nclusters of 32 union councils that will test the feasibility of adjoining union councils sharing \nrevenues from the growth center markets, and using such revenues for maintaining RR-2 and \nRR-3  and  other  infrastructure,  and  for  local  development.  The  pilot  unions  will  be  given \nadditional  responsibilities  and  incentives  to  increase  revenue  mobilization  and  retain  the \nrevenue for local development. This process will improve local governance.  The Project will \nfocus on developing the capacity of union councils and market management committees, and \nintroducing  other  mechanisms  for  improved  interaction  with  a  range  of  stakeholders  and \n                                                 \n13 The proposed  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  Sector  Project seeks  to  improve  urban \ngovernance in selected secondary towns of Bangladesh, focusing on urban councils, however, unlike in the \nProject, the urban councils will receive substantial funds to implement infrastructure investments. ", "8 \nbeneficiary groups involved in the rural development process. Promoting greater stakeholder \nparticipation in and planning of developments in their area will lead to better coordinated line \nagency activities at the union level and improved economic opportunities for the rural poor. \nChanging the organizational culture of LGED to include consideration of community participation \nin planning and implementing rural infrastructure is another feature of the proposed Project. The \nProject will support LGED to move from an implementation role to a role that facilitates greater \ninvolvement by the local level and the private sector. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n29.  The estimated project cost is $112.4 million equivalent, inclusive of physical and price \ncontingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and service charges during construction. The \nforeign exchange cost is estimated at $30.1 million, or about 26.8% of the total cost. The local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $82.3 million equivalent, or about 73.2% of the total cost. The local \ncurrency costs include an estimated $6.8 million equivalent for taxes and duties. The project \ncost estimate summarized in Table 1 should be regarded as indicative only. The detailed project \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Financing Plan \n30.  The Government has requested a loan of $60.0 million from ADB's Special Funds \nresources to help finance 53.4% of the project cost. The loan will finance $23.5 million of the \nforeign exchange cost (78.1% of the total foreign exchange cost), and $36.5 million equivalent \nof the local currency cost (44.4% of the total local currency cost). The German Government has \nbeen requested to provide a grant through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) for financial ", "9 \ncooperation of $11.9 million equivalent,14 or 10.5% of the project cost to finance project activities \nin four districts15 and implementation consultants in Khulna division. The German Government \nhas  also  been  requested  to  provide  a  grant  through  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit (GTZ) for technical cooperation of $5.0 million equivalent, or 4.5% of the \nproject cost. The Government will provide $34.0 million equivalent, or 30.3% of the project cost. \nUnion councils will contribute $1.5 million equivalent, or 1.3% of the project cost by contributing \n10% of the cash cost for the civil works for bridges and culverts, growth center markets, boat \nlandings,  and  union  office  complexes.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  continue  to  seek \ncofinancing sources. If additional funds become available during implementation, the project \nscope will be correspondingly increased. Also, if funding from the German Government is not \nforthcoming, the scope will be adjusted to fit the available funds. Local cost financing is justified \ngiven the poverty-oriented nature of the Project and the tight fiscal situation in the country.  \n \n31.  The Borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. The ADB loan will have a \nmaturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The loan will carry an interest charge \nof  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.5%  per  annum  during  the \namortization period.

Implementation Arrangements  \n1.  Project Management \n32.  The Executing Agency will be LGED in the Local Government Division of MLGRDC. The \nexisting interministerial steering committee established under the ongoing RIDP-III will be used \nto oversee the Project.16 The steering committee will meet as necessary, but not less than once \na year to review progress. The Project will be implemented by an appropriately staffed project \nmanagement office (PMO) that LGED will establish at its headquarters in Dhaka, led by a full-\ntime project director. The Government will require LGED to appoint the key project PMO staff\u2013\nincluding the project director, two deputy project directors, district engineers, accounts officers, \n                                                 \n14 The German Government has indicated that it is considering increasing the grant through KfW to $16 million \nequivalent. \n15 Chaudanga, Jhenaidah, Kushtia, and Meherpur districts.  \n16 The secretary of the Local Government Division (LGD) will chair the committee, with members from LGD, LGED, \nRHD, the Planning Commission of the Ministry of Planning, the Economics Relations Division of the Ministry of \nFinance, the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division of the Ministry of Planning, the National Institute of \nLocal Government, the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, local government bodies, NGOs, and the private \nsector. ", "10 \nan environment specialist, and the senior resettlement officer\u2013by the date of loan approval. The \nproject director will report to the chief engineer of LGED, and, supported by the PMO, will \ncoordinate  all  project  activities,  and  will  be  directly  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and  supervision.  The  PMO  will  establish  two  zonal  offices\u2013in \nLGED\u2019s Jessore and Barisal district offices\u2013each headed by a deputy project director. \n \n33.  The PMO will (i) prepare the project implementation plan and consolidated annual work \nplan, (ii) closely monitor project progress in each subdistrict, (iii) prepare detailed subproject \ndesigns and appraisal reports, (iv) monitor and supervise all project management activities, (v) \norganize  project  performance  management  activities,  (vi)  ensure  the  satisfactory \nimplementation of the gender action plan and other activities under the summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy, and (vii) prepare necessary progress reports and the project \ncompletion  report.  The  PMO  will  be  adequately  staffed  and  assisted  by  consultants  with \nexpertise in engineering, finance and accounting, social and gender development, and capacity \nbuilding and local governance.  \n \n34.  The staff of the LGED district and subdistrict offices will work closely with the union \ncouncils and market and boat landing management committees to implement relevant project \nactivities. Union development coordination committees will be formed to provide a mechanism \nfor stakeholders and beneficiaries to participate in subproject planning and implementation. \nLGED will also facilitate effective operation of citizens' forums. \n \n2.  Subproject Implementation \n35.  The TA examined 20 sample FRBs that are considered a representative sample of the \n99 candidate FRBs in the shortlist to be considered for final detailed design and improvement. \nThe eligibility criteria for subproject roads and other infrastructure give the guidelines for the \nfinal approval of the subprojects. The criteria target poorer unions, taking into account social \nand economic indicators, roads, poverty, gender disparity, and environmental conditions in the \nsubproject area. A participatory approach will be used to apply the criteria and to identify other \nissues during implementation. To be eligible for financing under the loan, the subprojects must \n(i) be technically justified and economically viable,17 (ii) be environmentally responsible and \n \nminimize land acquisition and resettlement, and (iii) comply with all applicable ADB guidelines. \nThe PMO and the  implementation consultant  will finalize the subproject detailed design and \nappraisal reports for LGED and ADB approval, using procedures approved by the ADB. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n36.  The Project will be implemented  over a 6-year period.  Implementation is expected to \nbegin  in  the  second  quarter  of  2003.  Initial  activities  will  include  filling  any  vacant  PMO \npositions,  recruiting  consultants,  preparing  the  detailed  design  of  the  subprojects  to  be \nimplemented in 2003, completing a benchmark survey, and procuring essential equipment. \nPhysical works may not start before the fourth quarter of 2003 to allow time for completing the \nsurveys  and  preparing  detailed  engineering  designs  and  contract  documents.  The  loan \nutilization period will terminate on 30 June 2009.  The Government will not award any ADB-\nfinanced civil works construction contracts until after the implementation consultants have been \nappointed, the land and rights to land, free of encumbrances, are available for execution of such \ncontracts, and resettlement activities and compensation payments have been completed.  A \nsummary project implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n                                                 \n17 The economic internal rate of return will exceed 12% for eligible subprojects. ", "11 \n \n4.  Procurement \n37.  Goods, related services, and civil works financed by ADB will be procured following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Since the civil works will be small and widely dispersed, \nforeign contractors are unlikely to be interested in bidding. Consequently, all the civil works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified \ncontractors in accordance with the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. \nPrequalification, selection, and engagement of contractors will be subject to the approval of \nADB. Contracts for FRBs, growth center markets, boat landings, and union office complexes will \ngenerally be awarded by the concerned LGED district executive engineer, while contracts for \nstructures on rural roads will be awarded by the LGED subdistrict engineer, under the guidance \nof the PMO. To ensure economy and efficiency in contract administration, small contracts for \nroads and drainage improvement works at various construction sites will be grouped together to \nobtain a higher contract value. Attempts will be made to award one contract for construction of \neach subproject FRB. Efforts will also be made to limit the number of contracts and engage \nlarger professional contractors. This approach will shorten the construction period and ensure \nsingle accountability for the quality of work. Civil works contracts below the expenditure limit of \n$50,000 will be permitted on a case-by-case basis. LGED will award contracts for infrastructure \nconstruction that prioritize the involvement of poor people. \n \n38.  Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost $500,000 or more will \nbe awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding, and those costing less than the \nequivalent of $500,000 (other than minor items) will be awarded on the basis of international \nshopping. Direct purchase procedures will be used for small or off-the-shelf items valued at less \nthan $100,000. The PMO will procure the equipment and vehicles. ADB has approved advance \naction and retroactive financing for recruiting implementation consultants\u2013from 2002 to the date \nof  effectiveness  of  the  ADB  loan\u2013to  facilitate  the  start-up  of  project  implementation.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of advance action and retroactive financing does \nnot commit ADB to finance the project. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 6. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n39.  Two consulting services groups are required to facilitate project implementation and to \nstrengthen LGED and improve local governance. An infrastructure implementation consultant \nwill provide 134 person-months of international and 1,238 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices for engineering design,  planning, tender evaluation, supervision, and monitoring of \nproject works. An international firm in association with a domestic firm will provide the services. \nA further 48 person-months of international and 606 person-months of domestic consultants will \nprovide capacity building and local governance support through a separate organization or firm. \nLGED will engage consulting services in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging consultants. Quality and \ncost-based selection procedures will be used in recruiting the consultants. The outline terms of \nreference and a personnel schedule for the implementation consultants are in Appendix 7. \n \n6.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n40.  Land  acquisition  problems  can  be  a  major  source  of  delays  in  implementing \ndevelopment projects in Bangladesh. Consequently, land acquisition requirements under the \nProject will be minimized, as they have been under the ongoing RIDP-III. All land required for \nroad and other infrastructure improvement is generally either within the existing right-of-way or ", "12 \nis owned by the Government. However, minimal parcels on government land only may have to \nbe acquired for road realignment, growth center market improvement, and union complex \nconstruction. To minimize implementation delays due to land acquisition, the location of project \ninfrastructure will be carefully determined. In addition, committees in the participating unions will \nbe formed at the start of the Project to undertake rapid selection and evaluation of potential land \nsites, and a subproject agreement will be signed with the union council. LGED, in cooperation \nwith the union committees, will complete the preparatory work for land acquisition before it \nsubmits subproject appraisal reports. Actual land acquisition will be completed within 365 days \nfrom the signing of the subproject agreement; otherwise, the subproject will be removed from \nthe Project. Should a subproject require any involuntary resettlement, the subproject appraisal \nreport  will  include  a  short  resettlement  plan,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and \nresettlement  policy.  All  compensation  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  completed  before \npossession of land and other assets. LGED will publicly disclose the short resettlement plans in \neach subproject area after subproject appraisal. \n \n7.  Maintenance \n41.  The  union  councils  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining  infrastructure  investments. \nConsultants will prepare maintenance manuals that describe the maintenance procedures for \nunion infrastructure for the use of the subdistrict engineering staff and union councils. The \nconsultants  will  provide  subdistrict  and  union  staff  with  specific  training  in  maintaining \ninfrastructure facilities. One of the tasks of the capacity building consultants will be to define \neach union\u2019s maintenance requirements and obtain a realistic assessment of the costs involved. \nThe consultants will use the manuals and on-the-job training to ensure that subdistrict and union \nstaff are familiar with their maintenance responsibilities and requirements. The Project requires \nthat the Government set aside adequate funds to cover maintenance expenditures for rural \ninfrastructure constructed in the participating unions each year. The Project will provide training \nto help the union councils generate additional revenue for this purpose. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n42.  The civil works contracts to be awarded will generally be small in value and involve a \nlarge  number  of  contractors.  To  ensure  effective  project  implementation  and  timely \ndisbursement, the Government will establish an imprest account in the name of the Project at \nthe  Bangladesh  Central  Bank  immediately  after  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement. \nPayments for eligible items will be made through this account. The statement of expenditure \n(SOE) procedure will be adopted to facilitate reimbursement and liquidation of small contracts. \nThe imprest account and the SOE procedure will be established, maintained, and audited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The ceiling of the imprest account will \nnot exceed the estimated ADB-financed expenditures for the next 6 months, or $6 million, \nwhichever is lower. The SOE procedure is applicable for reimbursing eligible expenditures \nbelow $50,000 equivalent and liquidating advances provided for in the imprest account. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n43.  The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation. The PMO will prepare the reports. The PMO will particularly address progress \nin meeting the project targets. The progress reports will include information on the physical \nprogress of works and the status of the training and local governance improvement program. \nWithin 3 months of substantial physical completion of the Project, LGED will submit to ADB a ", "13 \nproject completion report that will cover the details of project implementation, cost, benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation activities, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n44.  LGED  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  so  as  to  facilitate \nidentification of income and expenditures related to the Project. The PMO will be assigned \nsufficient and qualified accounting staff, including a financial manager. Auditors acceptable to \nADB will audit all the accounts and statements of expenditures and revenues related to the \nProject annually. The Foreign Aided Project Audit Directorate is considered acceptable for this \npurpose. The annual audit will include the audit of the imprest account and SOE procedure. The \nannual audit report will include a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and \nSOE procedure. Audited financial statements and project accounts, together with the report of \nthe auditor, will be submitted within 9 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n45.  To ensure that project activities and facilities are managed efficiently and that target \ngroups receive the intended benefits, a participatory benefit monitoring and evaluation program \nis included in ADB\u2019s project performance management system (PPMS) framework. PPMS \nactivities will be conducted periodically to gather information through multiple sources to assess \nwhether the project inputs and activities have delivered the expected outputs and benefits to the \nintended beneficiaries. The PPMS also seeks to detect at an early stage any discrepancy \nbetween the plan and the execution of the Project. The PMO will conduct initial district-level \nbaseline physical and socioeconomic surveys and submit a detailed implementation plan for \nmonitoring  performance  and  for  preparing  benchmark  information  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and \nconcurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. Thereafter, the PMO will submit annual \nbenefit monitoring reports to ADB throughout the implementation period. \n \n11.  Project Review \n46.  Many unions and components are covered by the Project; therefore, the regular reviews \nto be conducted by ADB at least twice a year will be supplemented by a formal midterm review, \nto be carried out jointly by the Government and ADB. The regular project reviews will include a \nreview of the union council\u2019s financial performance and staffing, implementation of the loan \ncovenants and reforms at the union level, implementation of the gender action plan, physical \nprogress of project implementation, and capacity-building activities. The proposed midterm \nreview  will  allow  the  Government  and  ADB  to  monitor  the  project  closely  and  to  make \nappropriate adjustments to the project design and implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Impacts \n47.  Evaluation of the quantifiable economic benefits and costs shows that the Project is \neconomically feasible, with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 22.8%. The basic \nassumptions on benefits and costs for the EIRR calculations were subjected to sensitivity tests \nunder various adverse scenarios. The results indicate that the project EIRR is robust in relation \nto changes in the basic assumptions. The summary economic analysis is in Appendix 8. \n \n48.  The  economic  impacts  of  the  Project  include  increased  economic  growth  and \nemployment  opportunities,  reduced  VOCs,  time  savings  for  road  users,  better  access  to \nmarkets and essential services, lower prices for farm inputs and consumption goods, better ", "14 \nmarketing  opportunities,  and  increased  employment  opportunities  in  the  road  and  market \nconstruction and maintenance programs. These benefits will lead to a higher GDP growth rate. \nAt present, many people do not have reliable access to health, markets, and educational \nservices because of the poor condition of existing roads. The quantified economic benefits \ninclude only reduced transport costs. The beneficiaries include (i) those benefiting directly from \nthe investment, that is, those who will be directly employed for infrastructure construction and \nmaintenance, and the various categories of road users such as owners and operators of buses \nand trucks, the passengers of the various vehicle categories, and the freight owners; and (ii) \nthose benefiting indirectly because they live and work in the roads' area of influence. \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction Impacts \n49.  Rural infrastructure investments have a direct impact on the income and nonincome \ndimensions of poverty of all income groups. For the poor, the lack of affordable access deprives \nthem of job opportunities and even of very basic social services. Reliable and regular access to \neducation and health services contributes directly to the poor's accumulation of human capital, \nwhich is a key factor in sustainable poverty reduction. Improved access will help reduce poverty \nby  (i)  increasing  labor  mobility,  particularly  to  distant  markets;  (ii)  increasing  employment \nopportunities; (iii) reducing loss of perishables, thereby allowing for increased farmgate prices; \n(iv)  improving  access  to  rural  areas  by  health,  school,  veterinary,  and  rural  development \nworkers; and (v) stimulating the creation of transport-associated small businesses such as \nservice stations, wayside food stalls, and guest houses. The Project will hire disadvantaged \ngroups and give first priority for employment to the poor and disadvantaged in the construction \nof  subprojects.  Appendix  9  gives  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy. \nDistribution analysis assessed the direct and quantifiable project benefits that will accrue to the \npoor in three core subprojects considered to be representative of the distributed impacts for the \nproject  area  as  a  whole.  The  benefits  included  the  savings  in  VOCs  for  motorized  and \nnonmotorized traffic on the FRBs. The benefits were allocated among the road users, unskilled \nconstruction workers, the Government, and moneylenders. When the gains and losses of all \nparties were netted, the three core subprojects had poverty impact ratios in the range of 0.34-\n6.45, indicating that the Project would have a strong impact on poverty. \n \nC.  Social Impacts \n50.  Improved  access  to  infrastructure  and  services  will  yield  significant  positive  social \nimpacts (paras. 48 and 49). The social benefits will be maximized by targeting construction work \nopportunities for local people, particularly women. When formulating subprojects, the existing \nand proposed education and health facilities will be considered so that benefits from improved \naccess to these facilities can be maximized. The multipurpose use of union complexes as a \nfocal point for community consultation and as cyclone shelters in the southeastern part of the \nproject area will also enhance positive impacts. The inclusion of poverty criteria in selecting and \nprioritizing subprojects will ensure that rural infrastructure investments are directed to the poorer \nareas. No indigenous people live on the selected roadsides. However, a good number of \nminority/indigenous people will potentially benefit. The Project will ensure their participation in \nplanning and implementing the Project and in obtaining benefits from the infrastructure. \n \nD.  Resettlement \n51.  The main socially negative impacts  of infrastructure projects are those resulting from \npermanent land acquisition. In this Project the requirement for land acquisition will be minor \nbecause roads normally follow the existing alignments. A project resettlement framework was ", "15 \nprepared (Appendix 10) to ensure compliance with ADB's resettlement policy, and sample short \nresettlement plans for 3 core subprojects were prepared as supplementary appendixes. \n \nE.  Gender and Development Issues \n52.  In the project area, 50% of the population is women and most of them are engaged in \nfarm household activities. The Project has sought opportunities to address gender concerns by \n(i) creating scope for women\u2019s participation at the level of 30% of total membership, from \nparticipatory  project  planning  to  implementation,  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (ii)  generating \nemployment opportunities for women by involving them in construction, maintenance, and tree \nplanting activities through labor contracting societies; (iii) facilitating linkages of rural women \nbeneficiaries  to  different  support  resources  for  sustainability  of  their  livelihood;  and  (iv) \nfacilitating social and economic development aimed at user groups as a follow-up measure to \nincreased access to infrastructure development activities. Women will also be supported in \ndeveloping entrepreneurship by reserving market stalls for women and creating linkages with \nmicrofinance  institutions.  The  component  on  LGED  capacity  building  and  improved  local \ngovernance  also  incorporates  the  gender  perspective  by  involving  and  training  women  in \nmanaging rural infrastructure. \n \n53.  The Project will employ specific measures to address gender issues in the project area \n(Appendix 11), including allocating at least 15% of the growth center market space as a \nwomen\u2019s market section, and 5-10 shops for the use of women shopkeepers; gender-based \nemployment  targets  on  all  project  contracts;  encouraging  women  shop  owners  to  form \nassociations and to be represented in the market management committees and citizen forums; \nand facilitating linkages with microfinance agencies and institutional linkages with government \ndepartments  and  NGOs  handling  development  programs  for  women  such  as  extension, \ntechnology, market promotion, microfinance, and legal aid. \n \nF.  Environmental Impacts \n54.  Direct construction impacts are likely on soil (due to excavation for road fill material) and \nthere is a risk of pollution to surface water and groundwater. There will also be social disruption \nincluding  noise  and  dust,  along  with  possible  increased  accident  and  health  risks.  These \nimpacts will be minimized with appropriate environmental management measures during the \ndesign and construction phases. \n \n55.  The main impacts of the proposed Project on the natural environment will be those \nassociated with possible changes in surface water flooding patterns as a result of constructing \nnew embankments. There would be indirect impacts on the fish resource system and aquatic \nhabitats. No new embankments will be constructed under the Project. However, adequate \ncross-drainage  structures  will  be  built  to  ensure  passage  of  floodwaters  without  causing \ndamage. In the estuarine areas of Khulna and Barisal divisions, structures will accommodate \nlocal  needs  for  flow  in  both  directions  or  gated  flow  in  one  direction  only.  The  main \nenvironmentally sensitive area near the Project is the Sundarbans, which is internationally \nimportant. No interventions will be considered in the designated Sundarbans area, or in the four \nother designated ecologically sensitive sites outside it.  The criteria for subproject selection \nexplicitly exclude subprojects proposed in or near these environmentally sensitive areas. While \nthere is likely to be some need to cut roadside trees so as to widen the roads, sensitive planning \nand a roadside  tree-planting program will more than compensate for those lost. A summary \ninitial environmental examination is in Appendix 12. Initial environmental examinations were \nundertaken for the three core subprojects, and  the environmental mitigation measures and ", "16 \nenvironmental monitoring requirements specified in the examinations will be adhered to in \nfinalizing all subprojects during implementation. \n \n56.  LGED recently established an environmental unit. With the assistance of consultants, \nthe  unit's  capacity  to  undertake  environmental  and  social  impact  assessments  will  be \nstrengthened. A full-time environmental specialist will be assigned to the unit. LGED has also \nrecognized the need to update the 1994 LGED environmental guidelines to conform with current \nlegal requirements for environmental assessment in Bangladesh. \n \nG.  Risks \n57.  The Project has been carefully formulated to manage and mitigate risks. Advance action \nwill expedite recruitment of consultants to supervise detailed design and implementation. Risks \nfrom the use of inexperienced local contractors to carry out the civil works have been mitigated \nwith their participation in training in several ADB and externally financed projects. Measures \nsuch  as  advance  procurement  action,  use  of  ADB\u2019s  standard  tender  documentation,  and \nstrengthened  project  management  arrangements  will  minimize  potential  delays  in  project \nimplementation.  Civil  works  contracts  will  only  be  awarded  after  the  resettlement  plan  is \nimplemented, and when the rights to the land and clearance of utilities and trees are obtained. \nThe Government\u2019s commitment to provide counterpart funding through budgetary allocations \nwill also be required before ADB approves contract award. The Government has assured ADB \nof adequate annual budget allocations to maintain the project facilities after completion. \n \n58.  The Government is committed to implementing its decentralization policy that will in \neffect empower the union councils. However, should this commitment diminish, the Project's \nparticipatory  capacity  building  and  resource  mobilization  activities  at  the  union  level  will \nnonetheless have empowered local communities to provide and demand delivery of better \nservices.  However,  this  risk  is  relatively  low  given  the  current  government  emphasis  on \ndecentralization, and commitment to introduce reforms. Stakeholder awareness raising courses \nare also included in the Project\u2019s training program to inform them of local governance issues \nand encourage them to demand better service delivery from government agencies. \n \n59.  There is currently a gap in funding for operation and maintenance of rural infrastructure, \nincluding roads. The Government has agreed to increase funding to meet future annual LGED \nmaintenance requirements and is exploring options for increasing maintenance funding for all \nroads in the country. Introduction of a guaranteed mechanism for funding road maintenance\u2013the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to aid agencies\u2013will reduce this risk significantly. \n \n60.  The Project will (i) select contractors on the basis of their resources and experience with \nroad construction; (ii) provide assistance to contractors by having the project consultant offer \npractical  day-to-day  management  and  technical  advice;  and  (iii)  ensure  the  Government's \ncommitment  to  promote  a  viable  and  efficient  private  sector  contracting  industry  for  road \nconstruction, improvement, and maintenance works. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n61.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. ", "17 \n(i)  If cofinancing by the German Government through either or both KfW and GTZ \nhas not been obtained by 30 September 2003, the scope of the improved rural \nroad infrastructure and improved rural infrastructure components will be reduced \naccordingly. \n \n(ii)  Subprojects will be selected in accordance with criteria agreed upon by the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Each  subproject  will  be  implemented  with  the  prior \napproval of both LGED and ADB. Before obtaining such approval, the PMO will \nsubmit a subproject appraisal report for each subproject for review by the project \nimplementation  consultant.  The  subproject  appraisal  report  will  establish  the \ntechnical, financial, and economic viability of the subproject and its components \nas well as its social and environmental sustainability. The report will also include \na summary initial environmental examination, an initial social assessment, and a \nresettlement plan if necessary. \n \n(iii)  Following ADB's approval of the subproject appraisal report, the concerned union \ncouncil will enter into a subproject agreement with LGED. The agreement will \ncover the delegation of responsibility for routine and periodic maintenance of \nnon-FRB  rural  roads,  market  facilities,  boat  landings,  and  union  council \ncomplexes to local government bodies. \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that the approved annual development program \nallocations  for  the  Project  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  all  counterpart  funding \nrequired for the Project in accordance with the financing plan, including the cost \nof land acquisition and other resettlement compensation, implementation and \nmonitoring activities under the land acquisition and resettlement plans, utility \nrelocation, and general project management expenses. \n \n(v)  The Government will ensure that local government bodies contribute at least \n10% in cash toward the construction cost of bridges and culverts on lower level \nrural roads (RR-2s and RR-3s), improvements to growth center markets and boat \nlandings, and construction of union council complexes. \n \n(vi)  In consultation with the concerned aid agencies, the Government will finalize the \nnational land transport policy before the midterm review. By the beginning of the \nyear 4 of the project, the Government will implement the recommendations of the \npolicy. \n \n(vii)  By  31  December  2003,  the  Government  will  issue  an  order  realigning \nmanagement and responsibility for the roads network as follows: (a) the national \nand regional roads (the primary road network) and those alone will be under the \nauthority of RHD; (b) all feeder roads (FRAs and FRBs) and RR-1s (secondary \nroad network) will be under the authority of LGED; and (c) RR-2 and RR-3 rural \nroads (the tertiary road network) will be under the authority of the subdistricts and \nunion councils. \n \n(viii)  Before the midterm review, the Government will examine the need for a road \ntransport and traffic bill. \n \n(ix)  Within 1 month of loan effectiveness, the Government will have approved the \nrecommendations of the LGED study on local resource mobilization and will have ", "18 \nbegun  to  implement  the  strategies  for  increasing  funds  allocation  to  union \ncouncils, and union council resource mobilization authority. \n \n(x)  LGED  will  continue  to  implement  fully  the  recommendations  of  the  LGED \nmanagement capability strengthening report, and will prepare an update to the \nreport by 30 September 2003, with a particular focus on strengthening LGED\u2019s \nmanagement and impact evaluation capacity. \n \n(xi)  By 31 March 2003, the Government will have finalized the revised policy on \nleasing of marketplaces and market management committee membership, and \nwill have adopted all measures needed to implement the policy. To increase \nresources available to the union councils for infrastructure development and \nmaintenance,  the  Government  will  review  and  subsequently  amend  the \nregulations for sharing the market lease revenue, and introduce more transparent \nprocedures and greater competition in market leasing in the project area. \n \n(xii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable labor laws. Bidding documents will include a clause prohibiting child \nlabor for construction and maintenance activities, and a clause regarding equal \npay  for  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  Compliance  with  these \nprovisions will be strictly monitored during project implementation. \n \n(xiii)  Within 1 month of loan effectiveness, the Government will issue a directive \nsetting employment targets for poor and vulnerable people, particularly women, \nfor road improvement and maintenance and other infrastructure construction \nactivities. The Government will also adopt all necessary measures to reach these \ntargets, including ensuring the provision of appropriate facilities for women and \nchildren in construction campsites. \n \n(xiv)  Before 30 June of each year during project implementation, LGED will agree with \nADB on the annual maintenance program for feeder and rural roads in the project \narea for the following year. By 31 May of every year, LGED will submit to ADB for \nreview, the proposed maintenance budget. \n \n(xv)  The Government will ensure that for the entire project implementation period, \nsufficient  budget  will  be  allocated  to  fund  fully  all  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance  activities  for  roads  that  fall  under  LGED\u2019s  responsibility.  This \namount will include budget allocations from all sources, including aid-financed \nproject funds and food aid allocated for maintenance works. \n \n(xvi)  The Government will adopt all necessary measures to ensure that construction \nand maintenance equipment is well maintained and replaced when needed. Such \nmeasures will include, but will not be limited to, the following: (a) RHD and LGED \nwill set the charges for renting their equipment at a sufficiently high level to cover \nthe  maintenance  and  replacement  costs  of  such  equipment;  and  (b)  the \nGovernment will annually make available to LGED funds at a level not less than \nthe estimated rent collected for the equipment in the following financial year. This \nwill be done through budget allocations into a separate identifiable item in the \nbudget  of  RHD  and  LGED.  RHD  and  LGED  will  ensure  that  the  budget \nallocations of these accounts will be used exclusively to fund the maintenance \nand replacement of the equipment. ", "19 \n(xvii)  The union development coordination committees to be established in each of the \n32  pilot  unions  under  the  LGED  capacity  building  and  local  governance \nimprovement component will be chaired by the union council chairpersons and \nwill have representatives from line agencies\u2019 staff, NGOs and representatives of \nunion market management committees, local village leaders, the private sector, \nand community members. \n \n(xviii)  LGED will assign at least 16 community organizers to coordinate with the pilot \nunions to expedite the implementation of project activities and local governance \nimprovement. The organizers will submit monthly progress reports to the PMO. \n \n(xix)  LGD and LGED will take all necessary steps to thoroughly test the concept of \npooling revenues from the growth center markets in each of the pilot unions. It \nwill delegate responsibility for the use of the funds to the concerned union \ncouncils and provide matching funds for those unions that demonstrate good \nperformance in increasing resource mobilization. \n \n(xx)  By 31 December 2003, the Government will have approved a time-bound action \nplan to increase private sector participation in road construction and periodic \nmaintenance.  The  action  plan  should  reflect  the  recommendations  of  the \nfeasibility study on such participation, which will be prepared by the Project\u2019s \nimplementation consultant. \n \n(xxi)  By  30  June  2003,  the  Government  will  have  established  a  committee  with \nrepresentatives from the private sector road construction companies, equipment \nleasing  companies,  and  RHD  and  LGED  to  advise  on  the  preparation  and \nimplementation of the action plan mentioned in (xx). \n \n(xxii)  LGED will ensure that all necessary steps are taken to implement the summary \ninitial environmental examination, the initial social assessment, and the project \nresettlement framework. Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, LGED will update \nits  1994  environmental  guidelines  in  conformity  with  the  current  legal \nrequirements for environmental assessment in Bangladesh. \n \n(xxiii)  On completion of the detailed design of the three core subprojects prepared \nduring the TA, the Government will update the resettlement plans and ensure \nthat  census  information  and  a  full  inventory  of  losses  are  included.  The \nentitlement matrix will be revised if additional categories of affected persons are \ndetermined.  A  condition  for  award  of  civil  works  contracts  for  those  core \nsubprojects will be the submission of an updated resettlement plan for each \nsubproject, consistent with the provisions of the resettlement framework and in \nform and substance acceptable to ADB. \n \n(xxiv)  The Government will ensure that all people affected by land acquisition will be \ncompensated prior to possession of land and assets. Compensation based on \nreplacement cost will be done in a manner satisfactory to ADB. \n \n(xxv)  The Government will ensure that LGED will complete all preparatory works for \nland acquisition before submitting the subproject appraisal reports. Actual land \nacquisition must be completed within 365 days from the signing of the subproject \nagreement; if not, the subproject will be removed from the Project. If involuntary ", "20 \nresettlement and land or asset acquisition are required, a resettlement plan will \nbe included in the subproject appraisal report. LGED will publicly disclose the \nresettlement plan for each subproject. The resettlement plan will be prepared in \naccordance  with  the  project  resettlement  framework  included  in  the  loan \ndocuments and ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement, and will include a complete \ncensus and inventory of losses. The PMO will not award any civil works contract \nfor any subproject unless a resettlement plan for such subproject, in form and \nsubstance acceptable to ADB, has been submitted to and approved by LGED \nand  ADB.  Land  acquisition  work  including  compensation  payments  will  be \ncompleted prior to possession of land and other assets, in accordance with the \nagreed upon resettlement plan. \n \n(xxvi)  The Government will take all necessary steps to ensure full implementation of the \nProject\u2019s gender action plan. \n \n(xxvii)  The Government will cause LGED to implement in full all the provisions of \nLGED\u2019s gender action plan for the Project's duration. To this end, the PMO will \nprepare field manuals for the gender action plan and conduct training for PMO \nstaff.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n62.  The following are the conditions for loan effectiveness. \n \n(i)  The project proforma, consistent with the Report and Recommendation to the \nPresident and loan agreement, will have been approved by the Government. \n \n(ii)  The PMO will be operational with all staff in place. \n \n(iii)  A first-year work plan for the PMO will have been prepared and submitted for \nADB\u2019s approval. \n \nVI.

Introduction \n1.  The principal project investment is in the improvement of feeder roads type B (FRBs). \nOther project investments such as growth center markets and boat landings are not appraised \nas  discrete  investments.  The  economic  evaluation  examines  a  set  of  20  sample  roads \nrepresentative of all FRBs in the project area. These sample roads were selected in a feasibility \nstudy  undertaken  by  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED).  Quantifiable \nbenefits of the FRB investment include savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs), time savings \nfor motorized traffic, and savings in operational and time costs for nonmotorized traffic. To be \nconservative, the economic analysis estimated costs and benefits with and without the project, \nbut excluded time savings. \n \n1.  Road Condition and Existing Traffic \n \n2.  Road condition in terms of roughness is measured by the international roughness index \nin meters per kilometer (m/km). In the without-project situation, earth roads have an average \nroughness index of 15 m/km; herringbone brick roads, 12 m/km; and bituminous carpet roads, 8 \nm/km. With the Project, road roughness is estimated to reduce to 4.0 m/km. It was assumed \nthat there are five classes of motorized vehicles and four classes of nonmotorized vehicles, \nprimarily with light load factors. Traffic counts were undertaken to identify existing traffic on each \nof the 20 subproject roads. In calculating the annual average daily traffic for the base year, the \ncounts were adjusted to reflect market days and seasonal differences in traffic. \n \n2.  Traffic Forecast \n3.  A review of historical information and recent studies indicates that transport of both \nfreight and passengers has grown at an average rate of approximately 8% per year over the \npast decade. This relatively high rate of growth is primarily due to improvements in the road \ntransport subsector and the growth of the Bangladesh economy. The economy is expected to \ncontinue growing rapidly over the next decade. The rate of traffic growth in Bangladesh is \nderived from the rate of growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and the income elasticity of \ndemand for transport with respect to the GDP. The gross domestic income elasticity of demand \nfor transport in Bangladesh is about 1.5 for both passengers and freight. The average annual \ngrowth rate of real GDP over the last decade is 5.5%, but there has been a slowdown in the last \nfew years because of crop failures. The current projection for annual growth in GDP is 5%, \nsuggesting annual traffic growth rates of 7-8% for Bangladesh. A standard set of traffic growth \nrates was adopted for the project evaluation. These rates reflect historical and forecast growth \nrates for the population and the economy, historical average traffic growth rates, and proposed \nimprovements for rural roads and associated infrastructure under the Project. \n \n4.  Normal traffic forecasts for each subproject road were calculated using base year traffic \nlevels and the rates of traffic growth. Generated traffic was not included in the traffic forecasts. \nFor subproject roads in poor condition and with no existing bus traffic, the with-Project scenario \nassumed that at least 2% of the motorized traffic will be light bus traffic. \n \nB.  Economic Evaluation \n5.  The economic analysis compared estimated benefits and costs of the Project for 20 \nyears\u2019 operation after completion of civil works. Valued in 2002 constant prices, the project \n ", "38  Appendix 8 \nbenefits and costs in financial prices were adjusted to economic prices by deducting taxes and \nduties, and by applying a conversion factor of 0.8 to nontraded local currency costs, used as the \nstandard conversion factor for the Bangladesh road sector. \n \n1.  Costs \n6.  The economic evaluation of the subproject roads included the costs associated with \nupgrading FRBs, improving other rural infrastructure, strengthening LGED and local government \ncapacity, improving maintenance procedures, and land acquisition and resettlement. Including \nphysical  contingencies,  but  excluding  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction, \nfinancial costs were converted to economic costs using a conversion factor of 0.8. Incremental \nmaintenance costs were calculated as the difference in maintenance requirements with and \nwithout the Project. It was assumed that in the without-Project scenario, the roads would receive \nminimal routine maintenance and spot improvements. The with-Project scenario includes full \nroutine maintenance and a periodic maintenance reseal every 5 years. No residual value was \nconsidered at the end of the project life. \n \n2.  Benefits \n7.  Improved road pavements and surfaces with the Project would reduce travel costs for all \nroad  users.  This  would  include  a  reduction  in  VOC  and  time  costs  for  motorized  and \nnonmotorized vehicles. Factors influencing VOCs include vehicle speed, horizontal and vertical \nalignments of the road, and the physical condition of the road surface, in addition to vehicle \ntype, price, age and load. For each year in the analysis period for all vehicle classes, highway \ndesign  and  maintenance  model  version  4  (HDM-4)  was  used  to  calculate  pavement \ndeterioration in the with- and without-project scenarios based on traffic levels and road design, \nand  to  calculate  the  annual  economic  VOC  and  time  savings  using  forecast  future  road \nroughness. No changes were made to the technical data in HDM-4. The input is in 2002 prices \nand is net of taxes, duties, and other charges. The output of the model includes physical \nquantities of road consumption and speed, and the associated VOC per predefined unit of 1,000 \nvehicle-kilometers.  \n \n8.  The Project is expected to generate additional benefits that have not been quantified. \nThese benefits include improved access to education and health facilities, reductions in rural \npoverty by employing the poor to improve the roads and other rural infrastructure, and maintain \nthe roads. Lower rural transport costs and travel times also encourage increased agricultural \nproduction of higher yielding rice and other crops because of lower prices for fertilizers and \nhigher farm and market prices. Lower transport costs, improved access, and mobility also \nencourage nonagricultural job creation in the service sector. \n \n3.  Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) \n9.  The economic evaluation of the subproject roads compared costs and benefits with and \nwithout the Project. It assumed that the project capital costs would be incurred in 2003-2004, \nand that the project benefits would start in 2005 and would continue for 20 years until 2024. The \nbasic quantified benefits are savings in road user VOCs and savings in operational costs for \nnonmotorized  traffic.  These  benefits  were  compared  with  the  economic  costs  of  road \nimprovement and maintenance. The net benefits were then used to calculate the EIRR. All costs \nand benefits were estimated net of duties and taxes, and are expressed in constant 2002 prices. \nThe EIRR was calculated for each subproject road and for each section of each road of a \ndifferent pavement construction type. The EIRR for the individual project roads ranged from \n ", "  Appendix 8  39 \n6.5% to 64.3%, while the EIRR of pavement sections ranged from 1.6% for a bituminous carpet \nsection in fair condition to 99.0% for an earth section in poor condition. The results of the \neconomic evaluation of individual subproject roads are summarized in Table A8.1. \n \nTable A8.1: Economic Internal Rates of Return of Subproject Roads \n \nEIRR \nName of FRB  EIRR by Section (%)  (%) of \n  Bituminous  Earth  Brick  Macadam  Road \nMirpur \u2013 Bheramara    64.3      64.3 \nMeherpur \u2013 Dariapur  6.9  36.4      16.6 \nDaulatgonj \u2013 Sabadalpur  10.3  41.4  15.1  43.0  35.7 \nKotchandpur \u2013 Gunna    45.7  9.3    17.8 \nKharaguda \u2013 Katlamari  10.2  39.0  12.6  11.1  26.1 \nSingra \u2013 Shimankhali  3.4  24.7  5.4    19.8 \nTularampur \u2013 Sheilkhati  4.8  27.8      24.3 \nChowgacha \u2013 Arpara  20.2  81.9      71.6 \nHaibatpur \u2013 Hasimpur  19.7  20.7  23.5    57.7 \nDigholia \u2013 Arua  23.2  99.0  28.4    37.6 \nBarakpur \u2013 Polathat  10.4  41.2  13.0    36.2 \nCharkhulia \u2013 Kachuria  1.6  22.9      21.6 \nKaligonj \u2013 Assasuni  12.9  42.8  15.6    20.3 \nMuladihat \u2013 Mridrahat    23.5  2.8    8.3 \nPirojpur \u2013 Sreeramkati  17.7  85.3  23.2    13.8 \nRajapur \u2013 Balorjore    13.4  2.5    6.5 \nSubitkhali \u2013 Kakrabunia      14.0    14.0 \nJhaudia \u2013 Halsha  3.5  25.3  5.7    13.1 \nChandkhali \u2013 Paikgacha  17.7  85.3  23.2    40.6 \nJhalokati \u2013 Manpasha  9.9  37.8  14.6    27.0 \nEIRR All Subproject Roads          22.8% \n    EIRR = economic internal rate of return; FRB = feeder road type B. \n \n10.  As indicated in Table A8.1, benefits from upgrading the existing earth road sections to \nan all-weather sealed surface are high. The upgrading of all earth sections is economically \njustified. However, upgrading a brick or bituminous section of a road is likely to generate \nrelatively lower economic benefits, suggesting that priority should be given to upgrading the \nearth  sections  to  provide  an  all-weather  road.  The  overall  cost  and  benefit  streams  for \nupgrading the 20 sample subproject roads resulted in an EIRR of 22.8%. The result reflects the \nhigh level of benefits associated with providing all-weather access in a rural environment. The \neconomic evaluation demonstrates that upgrading the project roads is economically justified. \n \n11.  The results in Table A8.1 represent the most conservative estimates of the EIRR, \nexcluding time savings for motorized and nonmotorized traffic. However, studies on the impact \nof improving rural roads and markets have found that travel time costs are reduced considerably \nwhen an all-weather FRB road is provided. Other factors that may affect the economic benefits \nand feasibility of the proposed road improvements include (i) delayed periodic maintenance of \nimproved roads and subsequent deterioration of the upgraded roads, (ii) reduced traffic growth \nrates, (iii) increased construction costs, and (iv) reduced nonmotorized traffic benefits. \n \n ", "40  Appendix 8 \n12.  Full  evaluation  of  the  20  subproject  roads  including  benefits  from  passenger  time \nsavings was carried out by rerunning HDM-4 for all sections of each subproject road. Including \nbenefits in passenger time savings significantly increased the quantified benefits of upgrading \nthose subproject roads. The overall package of 20 subproject roads had an EIRR of 66.5%, with \npassenger  time  savings  included.  The  significant  increase  in  EIRR  reflects  the  scale  of \npassenger time savings compared with other benefits. The major part of existing traffic on the \nproject roads is nonmotorized vehicles that have very low financial operating costs. The main \neconomic costs for these vehicles are the time of the operator and the opportunity time  of \npassengers. When FRB earth roads in poor condition are upgraded to good sealed roads, the \nspeed of rickshaws and rickshaw vans on those roads will increase by more than 400%. The \nincrease will significantly improve the productivity of the rickshaw operators, so that they can \nlower their charges. Lower charges and potential time savings encourage additional customers \nand additional economic activity, especially by those who participate in the cash economy. \n \n13.  HDM-4 was also rerun to test the sensitivity of subproject road improvements to a 5-year \ndelay in periodic maintenance. The present LGED practice is to reseal roads every 4-5 years \nand it is likely that this timing would apply to the project roads. The analysis indicated that if \nperiodic resealing were delayed 5 years and normal routine patching and potholing continued, \nthe EIRR for the improved subproject roads would increase from 22.8% to 23.8%. This suggests \nthat it may be appropriate to conduct pavement surface trials in the project areas to determine \nthe optimum timing for periodic reseals for FRB roads. If the 4-5 year reseal program is \nsupported by the research results, then there is a need to recalibrate HDM-4 to better model \nBangladesh rural road conditions. The Project will provide assistance in refining the model. \n \n14.  The annual traffic growth rates used indicate a 343% increase in traffic over the 22-year \nproject life. However, if economic growth in Bangladesh were to fall to only 3% per annum, it is \npossible that traffic growth rates in the project area would fall to approximately 4.5% per annum. \nThis is equivalent to a 23% reduction in traffic volumes over the project life. When traffic growth \nrates were reduced to 4.5% per annum for all vehicle classes, the EIRR for all subproject roads \nfell from 22.8% to 17.6%. Similarly a 15% increase in capital costs reduces the EIRR from \n22.8% to 20.3%. A corresponding 15% decrease in motorized and nonmotorized traffic benefits \nwould reduce the EIRR to 19.5%. Generally, the results of the sensitivity tests indicate that the \nProject\u2019s viability is robust to adverse changes in key variables. \n \n15.  The sensitivity indicator1 was calculated. The results of the sensitivity analysis are in \nTable A8.2. Switching values2 were also calculated. The scenario of a combination of a 15% \ndecrease in benefits, a 15% increase in capital costs, and a 23% reduction in forecast traffic \nbecause of lower GDP growth rates reduced the EIRR for the overall sample subproject roads \nfrom 22.8% to 15.8%, which is still economically viable. \n                                                 \n1  The sensitivity indicator shows the effect of a change in a variable on the Project. \n2  The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required for \nthe net present value to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR being reduced to the cutoff level of 12%. \n ", "  Appendix 8  41 \n \n \nTable A8.2: Results of Sensitivity Analysis \n \nScenario  EIRR(%)  Net  Switching  Sensitivity \nPresent  Value (%)  Indicator a \nValue (Tk \nmillion) \n         \n1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a   Yes  Sector identified as a national  Yes \nnational priority in country   priority in country poverty \npoverty analysis?  partnership agreement? \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty: \n \nPoverty remains pervasive in Bangladesh. Investments in social infrastructure (education, health, \nand nutrition) and physical infrastructure (roads, electricity, and flood control) are seen as important \ninputs for sustainable poverty reduction. The impact of rural infrastructure on poverty reduction is \nwell documented in the development literature of Bangladesh. Roads and growth centers can \ninfluence poverty reduction by creating new employment opportunities, especially in the nonfarm \nsectors, changing input and output prices, and through higher wages. \n \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction by creating sustainable seasonal and long-term \nemployment opportunities targeted to the poor. Increased levels of transport services will create \nemployment for the poor on bus, truck, and other traditional modes of transport plying rural roads. \nSimilarly, the improved growth centers are expected to serve landless and marginal farmers, and \nsmall  traders.  The  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  socioeconomic \ndevelopment of the region by providing immediate economic benefits to farmers, merchants, and \nother occupational groups including poor men and women, through better access to goods and \nservices. The improvement of feeder roads type B (about 1,030 kilometers), 60 growth centers, 50 \nboat landings, and 5 ferries will improve access to markets, social facilities, and employment \nopportunities.  \n \nThe infrastructure improvement undertaken by the Project will directly generate income-earning \nopportunities of about 50,000 person-years for the poor. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Poverty intervention \nThe people below the poverty line in the country declined by about 1 percentage point annually \nover the last decade. The household income and expenditure survey of the Bangladesh Bureau of \nStatistics 2000 shows that about 50% of the population of the country lived below the upper poverty \nline in 2000. Over the last decade, rural poverty remained more extensive than urban poverty. In \nBarisal (40%) and Khulna (51%) divisions together, 47% of the people were below the upper \npoverty line in 2000. In the decade ending in 2000, poverty incidence in these two divisions \ndeclined by about 1.4 percentage points per year. Although poverty incidence in the two divisions is \nslightly below the national average, per capita gross domestic product in FY2000 was lower in \nBarisal ($306) and Khulna ($355) than the national average ($363). In some of the districts of \nKhulna and Barisal, poverty incidence is greater than the divisional and national averages. Over 11 \nmillion people in Khulna and Barisal are poor. The mean per capita expenditure during the last \ndecade increased by 2.1% annually in these divisions, compared with the annual increase of 2.4% \nin the national average. \n \nAccording to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics 2000, household income and expenditure survey, \nthe  cost-of-basic-need  poverty  lines  expressed  as  Tk/person/month  in  Barisal  (covering  rural \nBarisal, Patuakali) were Tk616 (upper poverty line) and Tk546 (lower poverty line). In Khulna \n(covering rural Khulna, Jessore, Kushtia), the cost-of-basic-need poverty lines in Tk/person/month \nare Tk624 (upper) and Tk527 (lower). \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  43 \nThe direct benefit to the poor from the Project will be employment opportunities in infrastructure \nconstruction  and  maintenance  activities.  An  estimated  135,000  person-years of employment \nopportunities will be created for unskilled laborers and an estimated 30% of the employment will be \ngenerated for women (Appendix 11, Summary Gender Action Plan). \n \nRoad networks will create employment for large numbers of poor as transport workers or operators, \nancillary support and service providers, and traders. Transport operation costs will be reduced and \npeople  including  men,  women,  and  children  will  have  better  access  to  service  facilities  and \ninstitutions including education, health, microfinance and small enterprises due to improved year-\nround communication. Travel time will be short. The market infrastructure will lead to better prices \nof locally produced goods and services, including increased volume of trading and improved \nstorage. Environmental conditions in market areas will be significantly improved. An important \nelement of the market infrastructure is to increase the self-reliance of poor women through their \naccess  to  market  infrastructure.  In  addition,  microfinance  agencies  including  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) will be encouraged to expand their credit support programs in the project \narea,  especially  to  the  women  shop  owners  to  increase  their  access  to  financial  resources. \nImproved rural infrastructure will also have a favorable impact on agricultural and nonagricultural \nwages, and agricultural output prices. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nThe infrastructure and other project components were discussed with the union councils and all \nmajor stakeholders in 25 field workshops. The outputs were (i) formulation of criteria for selecting \nroads, growth centers, and boat landings for improvement; and (ii) identification of roads, growth \ncenters, and boat landings of each subdistrict. The selection was confirmed during two regional \nworkshops.  There  were  recommendations  on  mechanisms to enhance the capacity of union \ncouncils, ways to ensure participation of women, and means to build the Local Government \nEngineering Department\u2019s (LGED's) capacity. \n \nTo strengthen the union councils and for greater sustainability of the infrastructure, a participatory \napproach will be followed in implementation. The Project will emphasize stakeholders\u2019 participation \nin implementation, operation, and maintenance of improved rural infrastructure; and union-level \ngovernance and revenue generation. \n \nIn the pilot unions, union development coordination committees consisting of union council and \nservice-providing  agencies  will  be  established.  Citizens\u2019  (including  women\u2019s)  participation  in \nplanning of union council activities will be ensured through citizens'- forums. Regular interaction \nbetween the union councils and citizens will be promoted through joint meetings, rallies, and \nconsultations  at  the  union  and  ward  levels.  Women\u2019s  participation  in  market  management \ncommittees,  infrastructure  maintenance,  and  markets  will  be  promoted.  NGOs  will  support \nestablishment of the participatory process in union council governance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "44  Appendix 9 \nD.

The Project intends to address poverty reduction, regional socioeconomic development, \nand acceleration of pro-poor economic growth by providing services and resources in the \nrelatively neglected southwestern region of the country. About 22.6 million people will benefit \ndirectly or indirectly from implementation of the Project in 16 districts: 10 in Khulna and 6 in \nBarisal divisions. \n \n2.  The Project will improve small-scale rural infrastructure\u2013improvement of rural roads for \nbetter access to markets, development of ferry landing sites in this riverine region, improvement \nof market growth centers to a certain standard according to the criteria established by the Local \nGovernment Engineering Department (LGED), the Project\u2019s Executing Agency. \n \n3.  Three core subprojects have been planned by evaluating various design factors, with full \nconsultation  with  and  participation  of  the  stakeholders.  An  overall  development  plan  and \nprioritization of the project investment plan will be prepared for the whole project area using \nlessons learned from the planning of these core projects. \n \n4.  The  three  subprojects  were  selected  from  three  districts:  Kushtia,  Khulna,  and \nJhalokathi. About 31 kilometers (km) of road will be widened and improved, and two market \ngrowth centers and three union council offices will be improved. Resettlement plans were \nprepared for these three core subprojects that will also serve as models for addressing potential \nresettlement issues in other subprojects. About 1.5 hectares of land, mostly along the existing \nroad, will be acquired. This will entail partial relocation and shifting of about 120 existing housing \nor business entities, and loss of agricultural land, fishing ponds, and livelihood. \n \n5.  The actual amount of land to be acquired and the number of people to be affected will be \nfinalized after conducting detailed socioeconomic surveys in conjunction with the subproject \ndesign. This resettlement framework will be used in preparing plans to resettle and rehabilitate \nthe  project-affected  persons,  and  guide  the  preparation  and  implementation  stages. \nImplementation of the subprojects is expected to start in the third quarter of 2003. \n \nB.  Resettlement Policy Framework \n \n6.  The current legislation governing land acquisition for public purposes is the Acquisition \nand Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance (Ordinance II of 1982) and its subsequent \namendments in 1993 and 1994. The 1982 ordinance is the only law that governs all cases of \nacquisition and requisition by the Government of immovable property (land, crops, and built \nstructures) for any public purpose or in the public interest. The ordinance does not cover \nproject-affected persons without title or ownership records such as informal settlers or squatters. \nFurther, in most cases, the compensation does not constitute market or replacement value of \nthe property acquired. \n \n7.  In the absence of a government policy consistent with the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement, poverty reduction, and social development, a project-\nspecific resettlement policy framework and resettlement procedure guidelines will be adopted. \nThe framework and guidelines in this appendix will apply to all subprojects to be prepared and \napproved under the Project. It will ensure that persons affected by land acquisition permanently \nor temporarily losing livelihood will be eligible for appropriate compensation in the Project. \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \n8.  The resettlement policy framework reflects the Government\u2019s land acquisition laws and \nregulations and ADB policy on involuntary resettlement and guidelines. It stipulates  eligibility \nand provisions for all types of losses (land, crop, trees, fish, structures, business, employment, \nworkdays,  wages,  and  social  infrastructure).  Land  for  land  will  not  be  feasible  because \nreplacement land is not available. As land acquisition will be minimal, project-affected persons\u2019 \nlivelihoods will be most affected. Lost livelihood will be compensated at full replacement cost, \nwhich will help the affected persons to rehabilitate themselves to a great extent. \n \n9.  Affected households compensated by the district deputy commissioner for lost assets \nwill receive (i) an additional cash grant to match replacement market value, and (ii) other \nresettlement assistance such as shifting allowance and compensation for loss of business, \nworkdays,  and  income  because  of  dislocation.  Households  headed  by  females  and  other \nvulnerable households will be eligible for further cash assistance to relocate and to reconstruct \nhouse or structure. Table A10 presents the measures adopted in the resettlement plan on land \nacquisition and resettlement issues to bridge the gap between the ADB policy on involuntary \nresettlement and the Government policy on land acquisition, and assessment and valuation of \nacquired property. \n \nC.  Resettlement Procedural Guidelines \n \n10.  The summary resettlement plans for the three core subprojects are in the supplementary \nappendixes. Specific resettlement procedure guidelines have been established to guide the \npreparation of appropriate resettlement plans that will be adequate for the magnitude of land \nacquisition for the subsequent subprojects. \n \n11.  The resettlement procedure guidelines require that (i) LGED carry out an initial social \nassessment survey once the scope of each subproject is identified, based on preliminary \ntechnical  designs;  (ii)  if  impacts  are  found  to  be  \u201csignificant,\u201d  LGED  will  prepare  a  full \nresettlement plan for each subproject; and (iii) if subproject impacts are less than significant, a \nshort resettlement plan will be sufficient for subproject preparation. The short resettlement plan \nmust, however, comply with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and other social safeguard \nguidelines. \n \nD.  Institutional Responsibilities and Resettlement Cost \n \n12.  The  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives,  through \nLGED, has overall coordination, planning, implementation, and financing responsibilities. LGED \nfully recognizes the importance and complexity of the resettlement programs in the Project. \nTherefore, an experienced nongovernment organization (NGO) or resettlement specialist with \nclearly defined tasks will be engaged to implement the plans. A senior LGED staff (preferably a \nsocial scientist), with the rank of executive engineer, will be appointed as chief resettlement \nofficer  to  supervise  the  implementation  work  with  the  help  of  existing  LGED  community \norganizers at the subdistrict level. \n \n13.  If required, the appointed NGO/consultant will open field offices in 16 districts and will \ninvolve affected persons, including women, in implementation. The NGO/consultant will also \nliaise with LGED and the contractor to assist the project-affected persons, especially women \nand other vulnerable persons to obtain employment during the construction period. In the \ncontractor contracts, LGED will include a provision for preferential employment of qualified \nproject-affected persons, including affected women, in road slope turfing. \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  49 \n14.  LGED  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement  plans  adhere  to  the  resettlement  policy \nframework  and  resettlement  procedure  guidelines  so  that  appropriate  entitlements  and \nmitigation measures are established. LGED will further ensure that the resettlement budgets are \ndelivered on time to the deputy commissioner\u2019s office and the implementing NGO/consultant, for \ntimely implementation of the resettlement plan. \n \n15.  The cost of land acquisition and resettlement for the Project is estimated at $1.4 million, \nincluding physical contingencies. The Government will provide the funds for land acquisition and \nresettlement. The funds will be released through the deputy commissioners' offices for acquired \nproperties, whereas all other additional benefits will be paid directly by the Executing Agency \nthrough the implementing NGO/consultant. \n \nE.  Disclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n16.  Each resettlement plan will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with the \nstakeholders  and  will  involve  focus  group  discussions  and  meetings,  particularly  with  the \nproject-affected people. The resettlement policy framework will be made available in the Bangla \nlanguage during focus group meetings at the village level. Copies of draft resettlement plans will \nbe distributed among community groups to obtain local inputs before finalizing the detailed \ndesign, after the socioeconomic survey so as to avoid fraudulent claims. \n \n17.  Complaints and grievance procedures will be outlined in each resettlement plan and \ngrievance redress committees will be established for each subproject, with representatives from \nLGED, affected persons, women and vulnerable groups, local government, and NGOs. The \nchief resettlement officer, or authorized person nominated by the chief resettlement officer, will \nchair the grievance redress committee.

The project preparation team undertook extensive consultations with the general public, \nwomen ward members of union councils, local women leaders, women's labor contracting \nsocieties for routine road maintenance, and women sellers at various markets. The purpose was \nto understand their needs and identify possible activities to incorporate gender and development \nin the project design. \n \n2.  From the consultations at the field level and the lessons from previous rural development \nprojects  of  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  and  other  agencies, a \nproject gender action plan (GAP) was prepared. The GAP covers capacity building for staff of \nthe project and government local bodies on gender and development; developing the capacity \nof  women  as  change  agents  and  beneficiaries;  gender-focused  infrastructure  and  other \nservices;  and  increasing  women\u2019s  participation  in  development  institutions,  infrastructure \nconstruction and maintenance, governance, and benefit monitoring. The GAP contained in a \nsupplementary appendix provides the details of the plan. The main elements of the GAP are (i) \nincreasing understanding\u2013on the part of stakeholders, including the project staff, the union \ncouncil  officials,  and  the  citizens\u2013of  the  role  of  women  in  rural  development  and  local \ngovernance; (ii) increasing participation of women in decision making, implementation, and \nmonitoring of community-based activities through union development coordination committees, \ncitizens' forums, and subdistrict development coordination committees; (iii) preparing women \nward members of union councils for their roles and responsibilities as public representatives; (iv) \nincreasing participation of women in implementing infrastructure investments and maintaining \nand managing completed works; (v) increasing access to infrastructure services and markets \noffered  by  the  Project;  (vi)  reducing  the  wage  differentials  between  women  and  men  in \nconstruction activities; (vii) mobilizing women groups assisted by nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) to promote their participation in  local governance; (viii) developing skills of women in \nmanaging  business,  managing  and  maintaining  infrastructure,  and  undertaking  income-\ngenerating activities; and (ix) linking women shop owners with microfinance sources. \n \n3.  Thirty-two  pilot  union  councils  will  undertake  specific  activities  to  promote  the \nparticipation  of  stakeholders  in  managing  the  union  council,  preparing  the  budget,  and \ncoordinating  development  programs.  The  capacity  of  women  citizens  and  women  ward \nmembers will be built through their participation in training and regular meetings. \n \n4.  The project consultants will assist the union councils to set targets and implement \nactivities. The consultants will support the development of training materials and field manuals \nfor the staff and for partner NGOs. The Project will arrange orientation and training for staff at \nvarious levels and NGO partners for orientation on the GAP. Specific training manuals will be \ndeveloped for the union council officials and the women ward members on their roles and \nresponsibilities in union council management and in promoting women\u2019s participation. Special \nmanuals and guidelines will be developed for the pilot project areas. \n \n5.  To support implementation and monitoring of the GAP in mainstreaming gender in the \nProject, a gender and development specialist will be hired, in addition to the training coordinator \nand community development specialist at the project level who will also support implementation \nof the GAP. The terms of reference of the staff and consultants will include their responsibilities \nin implementing and monitoring the GAP at their respective levels. At the subdistrict level, LGED \ncommunity organizers will be trained and be responsible for implementing and monitoring \nactivities related to gender mainstreaming. \n ", "  Appendix 11  53 \n6.  The implementation of the GAP will be ensured and monitored. The project monitoring \nsystem will be developed with gender-sensitive tools, formats, and reporting system for various \nlevels. Project staff will receive training to monitor gender-disaggregated data, and gender-\nspecific information will be included in the project reporting system. The monitoring system will \ninclude the union councils and women in monitoring and assessing benefits and impacts. \n \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The initial environmental examination (IEE) of the Project, which seeks to upgrade the \nlocal road transport network and physical infrastructure in 16 specified districts in the southwest \nof  Bangladesh,  aims  to  determine  the  degree  of  the  likely  impacts  and  identify  possible \nmitigation measures for the proposed Project. The primary output is a statement on whether the \nProject is fundamentally sound in environmental terms. The IEE will indicate if a further detailed \nfull  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  is  required,  or  if  the  IEE  itself  with  specified \nmitigation and enhancement measures suffices to address the management of the predicted \nenvironmental impacts. The EIA includes both the natural and human/social environments. Of \nspecific concern is the human use of resources and how this changes as a result of the \nproposed  project  interventions.  The  key  environmental  concerns  were  identified  using  a \nchecklist screening procedure and analyzed for each of the four elements of the proposed \nProject.  Appropriate  mitigation  and  enhancement  measures  have  been  suggested  for  the \nidentified impacts. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The Project does not follow the conventional feasibility study and detailed design phases \ncompleted prior to project implementation. The summary IEE (SIEE) thus forms an overall initial \nscoping of the broad framework of the Project and allows key environmental issues to be \nidentified so that detailed subproject formulation can take them into account. The project area \nincludes the Sundarbans mangrove forest area. While the project area is large, the proposed \ninterventions are spread widely across it. As a result, the likelihood of significant localized \ncumulative impacts is reduced. There are unlikely to be significant impacts that will affect \nlocations outside the project area. Three core subprojects were identified as case examples with \nSIEE conclusions. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  The environmental baseline situation in the project area is extremely well documented in \nthe regional environmental profiles produced for the whole country by the Water Resources \nPlanning Organization as part of the National Water Management Plan. A semidetailed baseline \ndescription, written in the context of the Project and following the sequence prescribed in the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) environmental assessment guidelines, was given in the IEE. \nThe work concludes that the following environmental issues\u2013listed in order of importance\u2013are \nthe most important in the project area: \n \n(i)  Changes in the water resources regime. The recent reductions in dry season \nsurface water flows in the area have consequences for surface water quality. \nLack of dilution appears to result in the saline water interface moving northward. \nReduction  in  flows  and  increased  sedimentation  are  reducing  natural  fish \nresources  and  boat  navigation,  including  the  accessibility  of  Mongla  port. \nLocalized flooding occurs in the monsoon season, particularly in the Khulna-\nJessore area where congested drainage is a problem. Bank erosion in north and \neast Bhola is severe and causes serious household destitution. \n(ii)  Management of environmentally sensitive areas. The Sundarbans area is of \ninternational importance and requires careful sustainable management. The four \n ", "  Appendix 12  55 \nother major sensitive areas are the perennial wetlands of Chanda, Dakatia, and \nMarjiat, which present complex management issues. The fourth is the designated \nwildlife sanctuary of Kukuri Mukri. \n(iii)  Relatively poor communication and access. The area has poor road links to \nthe rest of the country. Within the area, the road network is less developed than \nthat in most other parts of the country. As a result, waterborne navigation is still \nimportant, especially in the southeast of the project area; however, reduced dry \nseason flows and increased sedimentation are serious problems. \n(iv)  Potable water supply and sanitation problems. Potable water supplies in the \ncoastal areas are expensive to exploit because the salinity of the shallow aquifer \nrequires deep tubewells. The incidence of natural arsenic in the shallow aquifer is \na serious problem for the central part of the project area. Lack of adequate \nsanitation facilities causes serious fecal pollution in surface water. \n(v)  Land  use  conflicts.  Land  use  conflicts  are  serious  between  shrimp \naquaculturists and agriculturists. Brackish water shrimp aquaculture is causing \nserious  environmental  damage  and  needs  to  be  managed  in  a  sustainable \nmanner. \n(vi)  Cyclone risk. The cyclone risk is very high in the coastal areas. The social \nimplications are very serious in the southeastern part of the study area where the \nSundarbans  do  not  provide  natural  protection  from  cyclone-induced  storm \nsurges. \nD.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n4.  Use of a master screening checklist drawn up for rural infrastructure development in \nBangladesh  identified  significant  impacts  (both  positive  and  negative)  and  eliminated \ninsignificant ones. An impact matrix was constructed using the checklist and is included in a \nsupplementary appendix. The potential impacts were rated separately for each of the four \nelements  of  the  Project.  A  checklist  identifying  significant  potential  project  impacts  was \nproduced. The impacts are outlined below, with the appropriate mitigation and enhancement \nmeasures. \n \n1.  Social Impacts \n \n5.  The main social negative impacts of the Project are likely to be the result of permanent \nland acquisition. While the requirement for acquisition is likely to be minor, the localized impacts \nat household level can be significant. A resettlement framework has been prepared. The Project \narea has 42 listed nationally important monuments and damage to them should be avoided in \npreparing the subprojects. \n \n6.  Due to improved access it is likely that there will be significant positive social impacts \nacross many sectors, including agriculture, industry, marketing, education, and health. It will be \npossible to maximize the direct social benefits by targeting construction work opportunities to \nlocal people, particularly women. In addition, there are significant enhancement possibilities if \nthe provision of deep tubewells in growth centers, boat landings, and union council centers is \ntargeted in the worst arsenic-affected areas. When formulating subprojects, the existing and \nplanned education and health facilities should be considered so that the potential benefits of \n ", "56  Appendix 12 \nimproved access to these facilities can be maximized. The multipurpose use of facilities as \ncyclone shelters in the southeast part of the project area will also enhance the positive impacts. \n \n2.  Environmental Impacts \n7.  The main environmental impacts are those associated with possible changes in surface \nwater flooding patterns. These include indirect impacts on the fish resource system and aquatic \nhabitats. The main mitigation measure for these impacts is to provide adequate cross-drainage \nfacilities to ensure that there are no changes in flooding patterns. The main environmentally \nsensitive area is the Sundarbans. No interventions should be considered in the designated \nSundarban area, nor in the four other designated ecologically sensitive sites outside it. Six \nspecies on the internationally threatened red list are found in the project area. While there is \nlikely to be some need to cut roadside trees to widen the roads, cutting can be minimized by \nsensitive planning. The roadside tree planting program will more than compensate for those \nlost. There is a serious erosion risk in the north and east of Bhola island and construction of any \nnew infrastructure should be avoided in those areas. \n \n3.  Environmental Criteria for Selection and Appraisal of Subprojects \n8.  Based on the SIEEs for the three core subprojects, the following environmental criteria \nshould  guide  the  selection  and  prioritization  of  subprojects:  (i)  no  subproject  should  be \nimplemented  in  the  Sundarbans  or  other  designated  protected  areas;  (ii)  the  extent  of  a \nperennial water body is not to be reduced to below that of February 1995 as a result of the \nProject; (iii) no registered historic building or cultural site should be affected; and (iv) land \nacquisition should be minimal. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n9.  National procedures for environmental assessment in Bangladesh are outlined in the \nEnvironmental Conservation Act of 1995 and the Environmental Conservation Rules of 1997. \nThe Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) has a set of environmental guidelines \nproduced in 1994; however, these need updating to incorporate the procedures that have to be \nfollowed  under  the  national  legal  requirements.  Under  the  classification  system  of  the \nenvironmental rules, the Project is likely to be in the orange B group. This is the second most \nsevere category,  which includes roads below the level of national or regional highways and \nbridges that are less than 100 meters long. However, the final categorization of the project by \nthe Department of Environment (DOE) is likely to depend on the degree of the resettlement \nrequirement. For an orange B classified project, an IEE with appropriate no-objection certificates \nneeds to be produced. \n \n10.  Assuming that the Project is categorized as orange B, then the key stages to be followed \nand the decisions that need to be made for the national environmental assessment process \nbefore subproject construction contracts are awarded are as follows: (i) ADB to approve the IEE \nand SIEE; (ii) agreement given to fund the subproject; (iii) discussion with DOE as to its \nenvironmental classification; (iv) if DOE declares the project to be in the orange B category, \nthen preparation of an IEE for submission to DOE, with a proposed general methodology for \nenvironmental assessment of each subproject at implementation stage; (v) if there is land \nacquisition, then prepare an outline resettlement action plan for submission to DOE with the \nIEE; (vi) obtain no-objection certificates from the local administration for submission to DOE with \nthe IEE; (vii) liaise with the Forest Department and the Inland Water Transport Authority to see if \nthey  require  special  approvals;  (viii)  submit  the  IEE,  the  no-objection  certificate,  and \n ", "  Appendix 12  57 \nresettlement action plan to DOE at least 90 working days before any construction contract is \nawarded; and (ix) obtain site clearance and an environmental clearance certificate from DOE. \n \n11.  Environmental management capability for subproject formulation and design will be \nneeded. The environmental assessment methodology  devised during the preparation of the \nDOE IEE document will need to be followed. Appropriate environmental management clauses \nalso need to be included in the construction contracts, with monitoring during construction. It will \nbe necessary to monitor the Project after completion to see if the predicted impacts (both \npositive and negative) actually occurred. \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n12.  The most significant potential impacts of the Project are those related to permanent land \nacquisition. These impacts are likely to be the most problematic, but because nearly all of the \nroad alignments are existing, the permanent land acquisition required is only for widening and \nwill not be large in area. It is predicted that all impacts can be mitigated, provided permanent \nland acquisition is minimized. Environmentally sensitive design during subproject formulation is \ncritical to minimize any negative impacts. \n \n13.  The overall detailed intervention program cannot be fixed at this stage, as it depends on \nsubproject  formulation,  which  is  based  on  assessment  of  local  needs.  The  subproject \nformulation process will be carried out during the implementation stage of the Project. Three \nsubprojects  have  been  assessed  as  case  examples  and  the  main  conclusion  is  that  the \nenvironmental issues are highly site specific and greatly differ. The main requirement is to \nestablish an environmental management system following general principles and that can be \nused during subproject finalization and implementation. The methodology that has been used \nfor the three sample subprojects will be refined during the next phase of the Project when a \nformal IEE is carried out for submission to DOE. \n \n14.  It will be necessary to strengthen LGED\u2019s capability to implement the environmental \nmanagement measures for the Project. This is particularly so because of the nature of the \nproject implementation program. LGED should appoint a full-time project environmental officer \nto check the work of the consultants and ensure compliance with the environmental assessment \nmethodology that will be developed for the formulation and design of the subprojects. It is urgent \nthat the 1994 LGED environmental guidelines be updated to conform to the legal requirements \nfor environmental assessment. \n \n15.  The Project is judged to be in ADB\u2019s environmental impact category B. However, the \ndegree  of  permanent  land  acquisition  required  can  be  accurately  assessed  only  during \nsubproject finalization at the implementation stage. The participatory planning process as part of \nsubproject detailed design ensures that land acquisition requirements will be minimized. \n \n16.  Once ADB approves the IEE and outline resettlement plan, then the national procedures \nfor environmental assessment will need to be followed. The nature of the national environmental \nassessment requirements will depend on DOE's classification of the Project (likely to be orange \nB),  which  will,  in  turn,  probably  depend  on  the  amount  of  land  acquisition  required.  The \nmethodology  for  environmental  assessment  of  the  subprojects  during  implementation  also \nneeds to be refined in consultation with DOE. The environmental assessment work should be \nan  intrinsic  part  of  subproject  planning  and  final  design.  LGED  will  require  a  full-time \nenvironmental specialist specifically designated for the Project over its duration. \n \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \nG.  Conclusions \n17.  The conceptual framework of the Project allows the establishment of a planning and \nimplementation  process  that  can  ensure  interventions  are  environmentally  sound  and \nsustainable. The process can be set up so that negative impacts, particularly land acquisition \nrequirements,  can  be  minimized  and  positive  impacts  enhanced.  Avoiding  or  adequately \nmitigating all predicted negative impacts will require detailed plans to be drawn up to address \nadequately the land acquisition, resettlement, and compensation issues for all subprojects. Land \nacquisition will need to be carried out in a fair, equitable, and timely manner for all subprojects. \n \n18.  The IEE has determined that the Project is in ADB's category B. If an acceptable outline \nresettlement strategy is produced, there is no need to carry out a detailed EIA. However, \nbecause of the nature of the implementation of the Project, it will be necessary to use an \nenvironmental assessment methodology for subproject formulation and management. The three \ncase study subprojects have demonstrated that the broad methodology used for the overall \nassessment will work at the subproject level, even though the environmental conditions, issues, \nand mix of interventions are very different for each subproject. \n \n19.  Under Bangladesh environmental assessment procedures, it is likely that all the project \ninterventions will be classified in the orange B group, as they are for upgrading of existing local \nroads and no bridges are likely to be longer than 100 meters. However, as the resettlement \nrequirements for each subproject cannot be finally quantified until the implementation stage, it \nwill probably be necessary to prepare a resettlement action plan to submit with an IEE and no-\nobjection certificates to DOE to obtain the necessary clearances. \n \n20.  The  required  LGED  capability  to  handle  adequately  the  environmental  assessment \nneeds of the Project has been reviewed and discussed with the environmental section of LGED. \nSince there are likely to be approximately 100 subprojects phased over 6 years, a full-time \nLGED environmental specialist will be needed to monitor the Project. \n \n1.  Summary of Conclusions of Jhaudia-Halsha Road Subproject IEE \n21.  The SIEE revealed that the subproject has no major significant negative environmental \nimpacts.  Potential  social  and  economic  benefits  including  poverty  reduction,  employment \ncreation,  and  income  generation  are  anticipated.  Some  potential  negative  environmental \nimpacts will likely arise from dust generation; soil, air, and noise pollution; disruption of fish and \nwildlife habitats; and tree removal. In addition, some socioeconomic impacts (acquisition of \nabout 0.2 hectares and relocation of about 4 houses, 30 commercial structures, and 1 rice mill) \nare also likely to occur. These impacts can be offset or reduced by implementing mitigation \nmeasures appropriate to the conditions.
