The  Government  of  Nepal  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare the Subregional Transport Facilitation Project.1 The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s 2003 TA program for Nepal. The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Nepal on \n11\u201322 August 2003 and held discussions with the Government on the goal, purpose, scope, \nimplementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference of the TA.   Appendix 1 provides a \npreliminary project framework. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n \n2.   Transport plays a critical role in Nepal\u2019s economic development. In terms of value, 52% \nof Nepal\u2019s exports and imports are with India; of the remaining 48%, most are with countries \noutside the subregion. To support its foreign trade, Nepal needs access to the road and rail \nnetwork in India and to seaports in India or Bangladesh. The principal Nepalese exports are \ngarments, woolen carpets, pashmina goods, and agricultural and food products. The principal \nimports in terms of value are electrical goods and machinery and equipment.   \n \n3.  Within Nepal, foreign trade is totally reliant on the domestic road network. Of the 15,905 \nkilometers of registered roads, only 4,617 kilometers are surfaced, 64% of which are classified \nas national highways. The country\u2019s principal road artery is the East-West Highway, which runs \nfrom Mahendranagar in the west to Kakarbita in the east.  The main trade corridors are the road \nconnections through (i) Birganj to Indian National Highway 28A and to Kolkata, (ii) Biratnagar to \nKolkata/Haldia in India via the national highway at Forbesganj, (iii) Bhairawa to Gorakpur, and \n(iii) Kakarbita to Kolkata and Haldia via West Bengal National Highway in India or to Chittagong \nor Mongla in Bangladesh via Banglabandha or Siliguri. The inland clearance depot (ICD), or  dry \nport, connected with the Indian Railways network through Raxaul, connecting to Kolkata, has \nbeen completed at Birganj and is expected to commence operation in 2004. Road ICDs at \nBhairawa and Biratnagar began operations in 2002.  In terms of the value of imports and \nexports, Birganj is the most important land transit point, accounting for 41% of total trade and of \nthird-country trade (ie, beyond adjacent countries). Biratnagar is the second most important \npoint, with 20% of the country\u2019s total trade, followed by Bhairawa with 9%, and Kakarbita with \n3%.   \n \n4.  The overall performance of the corridors is poor due to a number of interrelated factors: \n(i) administratively cumbersome and time-consuming customs clearance and other cross-border \ninspections, (ii) inadequate and inefficient freight handling facilities in customs areas, (iii) traffic \ncongestion at border crossings, and (iv) the poor condition of many access roads. The present \naccess  road  from  the  rail-based  ICD  in  Birganj  to  the  Tribhuvan  Highway  is  narrow  and \ncongested, and cannot accommodate the traffic expected when the ICD is in full operation for \ngoods handling with India and third-country traffic.  The customs station in Birganj is unable to \nhandle cargo clearance efficiently. The ICD in Biratnagar is unable to meet the peak capacity \ndemand, and the road to the Indian border is congested and poorly managed. Road access in \nBiratnagar is similarly narrow and unpaved. The customs stations at Kakarbita on the east \nborder of Nepal, for traffic with Bangladesh, Bhutan, and India, and at Mahendranagar on the \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 18 July 2003 under the name of   \nSubregional Road Connections. It was renamed to better reflect the project scope. ", "2  \nwest border of Nepal with India are also in very poor condition. These factors result in significant \ndelays in travel time and increased vehicle operating costs, and, if not properly addressed, will \ncontinue to hamper subregional trade.    \n \n5.  The  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  program  identified \nBhairawa,  Biratnagar,  Birganj,  Kakarbita,  and  Nepalganj  as  major  crossings  in  Nepal  with \nsubregional impact. The need to improve Krishnanagar and Mahendranagar is being studied \nunder  the  ADB-approved  regional  technical  assistance,  Subregional  Corridor  Operational \nEfficiency Study (SCOES).2 \n \n6.      The Government\u2019s 20-year plan includes construction of road access between the rail \nbased ICD in Birganj and Tribhuvan Highway to avoid the present narrow Padam road that \nconnects  the  rail-based  ICD  with  Tribhuvan  Highway,  and  widen  the  road  in  Bhairawa \nconnecting eastward to the East-West Highway. The Government plans to build access control \nroads between Hetauda and the Birganj customs station, to alleviate congestion created by \nlarge volumes of motorized and non-motorized traffic on sections of the Tribhuvan Highway and \nits by-pass.  In addition, Government plans to build road-based ICDs at Birganj and Kakarbita, \nexpand the ICD at Biratnagar and improve the road connection at Biratnagar to the Indian \nborder, and move the customs station at Mahendranagar to the newly built crossing border \nbridge  with  India.  The  Government  also  wants  to  improve  access  roads  and/or  customs \nhandling  facilities  at  crossing  borders  at  Bhairahawa,  Krishnanagar,  Mahendranagar  and \nNepalganj. \n    \n7.   Nepal  has  introduced  the  automatic  system  of  customs  data  (ASYCUDA)  at  four \nlocations: Tribhuvan Airport, Bhairawa, Biratnagar and Birganj.  At present, the system is used \nfor  manual  entry  of  declarations,  calculation  of  customs  duties,  and  accounting.    The \nGovernment plans to expand the system to allow preapproved shippers to avoid inspections \nand to allow shipping agents to enter their documents through the Internet. The Government \nalso plans to introduce the ASYCUDA at all important customs stations, which will require \nprovision of adequate offices, power, and communications.  The Government is planning to \nintroduce additional features of the ASYCUDA and will make the necessary changes in the \ncustoms legislation.  \n \n8.  To remove the physical and institutional elements impeding exports and imports within \nand outside the subregion,  Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal have established the South \nAsian Growth Quadrangle.  ADB has been facilitating the initiative of the quadrangle countries \nsince 2000 through the SASEC program.  Two ADB regional TAs have been provided to identify \nand prioritize subregional cooperation projects3 and to establish and consolidate the institutional \nframework for regional economic cooperation.4  In addition, ADB approved a regional TA for the \nSCOES  to  identify  specific  measures  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  individual  subregional \ncorridors, with particular emphasis on solutions to \u201cchoke point\u201d problems at key land and sea \ngateways and to removing institutional and operational impediments. The SCOES will develop \nproject/program concepts to facilitate financing by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies.  The \nSCOES will be completed by January 2004.   \n \n                                                 \n2 ADB.2003.

The transport sector has featured prominently in the SASEC program. ADB is expecting \nto finance feeder links into the West Bengal Corridor in India to improve the state highway from \nthe Bhutan border at Phuentsholing to the East-West Corridor at Hasimara, and to improve the \nstate highway between the Bangladesh border at Fulbari and the Nepal border at  Khakarbhitta. \nUnder  a  proposed  road  sector loan  to  Bhutan  in  2004,  ADB  is  also  expecting  to  finance \nupgrading of the road from Phuentsholing to Thimpu. A further proposed ADB loan to Bhutan is \nexpected to finance development of a logistics terminal at Phuentsholing.5 ADB\u2019s proposed road \nsector loan to Bangladesh in 2003 is expected to include a component to upgrade the road from \nFulbari to Banglabhandh, where it connects with the existing national highway (5) to Dhaka via \nthe Jamuna Bridge. ADB is currently financing improvement of Nepal\u2019s East-West Highway \nclose to Kakarbita.6   \n \n \nIII.    THE  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The TA will assist the Government to prepare a project suitable for ADB financing to \nimprove customs and transshipment facilities and road access at the principal border crossings \nin Nepal, thereby promoting economic development and poverty reduction in the subregion. The \nproposed Project will improve the subregional transport network and border facilities in order to \nreduce the transport costs and customs processing delays so that the cost of imports and \nexports among Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and other countries can be significantly \nlowered.  The  improvements  will  support  growth  in  subregional  trade  and  investment,  and \nthereby contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction.  The Project will also improve the \nextremely poor environmental conditions, including air and water pollution and land degradation, \nin the densely populated areas adjacent to the border access roads and crossings. It will \nprovide better facilities for pedestrian, bicycle, and bus passenger transport and will include \nmeasures  to  address  the  vulnerability  of  local  people  to  HIV/AIDS,7  sexually  transmitted \ndiseases, and trafficking of women and children. Drawing upon and supported by the TA, ADB \ntentative plans to process the loan for the Project in 2004. \n \n11.  The Project will be divided into five groups of subprojects on the basis of location: (i) at \nBirganj, development of a new access road for the rail ICD, redevelopment of the  customs area \nas a road ICD, and construction of access control roads on sections of the Tribhuvan Highway; \n(ii) at Kakarbita, development of a road ICD; (iii) at Biratnagar, road improvements at the border \nto  reduce  road  congestion  and  expand  the  existing  ICD  as  required;  (iv)  improvement  in \ncustoms  and  freight  handling  facilities  and  road  access  to  Bhairahawa,  Krishnanagar, \nMahendranagar, and Nepalganj; and (v) technical support to the Government for implementing \nmanagement  procedures,  regulations,  and  (if  necessary)  information  technology  systems, \nincluding  further  development  of  ASYCUDA  modules  to  improve  ICD  operations,  customs \nprocedures, and other document processing.   The scope of subprojects will be refined after the \nSCOES findings are available, expected in January 2004. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

The TA will complete the preparatory studies required to examine the feasibility of each \nsubproject and to comply with ADB\u2019s safeguard and other policies and requirements for possible \nloan financing. This will include (i) assessment of institutional capacity and implementation \narrangements  and  sector analysis in the context of subregional cooperation; (ii) traffic forecast,  \ndesign studies, and cost estimation for all subprojects, including roads, bridges, ICDs,  and \ncustoms station; (iii) economic analysis, distribution analysis, and estimated poverty impact \nratios;  (iv)  financial  analysis  for  the  ICDs;  (v)  environmental  impact  assessment;  (vi)  a \nresettlement plan; (vii) support for preparation of indigenous people\u2019s development plans as \nrequired on the basis of the findings of the poverty and social assessment;8 (viii) identification of \nareas  of  reforms  and  improving  ICD  and  customs  operations  procedures;  and  (ix)  close \ncoordination with (a) the SASEC Secretariat, (b) TA teams of the SCOES and the Market Access \nand Productivity Growth for the Private Sector Project, and (c) the Trade and Private Sector \nWorking Group. Appendix 2 provides a summary initial poverty and social analysis. \n \n13.  The TA will review the findings of the SCOES, which is expected to be completed before \nthe TA commences, and, wherever possible, incorporate the investment concepts proposed for \nNepal by the SCOES. The TA will carry out all studies necessary to meet ADB\u2019s requirements \nfor possible loan financing. The TA will also support ADB\u2019s loan fact-finding and appraisal \nmissions.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing   \n \n14.   The cost of the TA is estimated at $725,000 equivalent, including a foreign exchange \ncomponent  of  about  $425,000  and  a  local  component  of  about  $300,000  equivalent.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to provide financing of $600,000 to meet the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $175,000 equivalent of local cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nfrom Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide \nabout $125,000 equivalent in kind through office accommodation, utilities, remuneration and per \ndiem of counterpart staff, surveys, and workshops. The Government has been advised that \nADB\u2019s approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project.  Further \ndetails are in Appendix 3. \n  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works \n(MPPW). The Department of Roads will be the Implementing Agency for overall coordination \nand implementation of the TA and particularly the road components, and the Ministry of Finance  \nand the  Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies will be responsible for border crossing \nfacilities enhancement and capacity building components.  A steering committee comprising the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Industry,  Commerce,  and  Supplies,  MPPW,  and  National \nPlanning Commission, and chaired by the secretary of MPPW will oversee implementation of \nthe TA. MPPW will appoint a TA director in its project implementation unit and will assign \nsuitably qualified counterpart staff to work alongside the consultants and assist in survey and \nfield work when necessary. The consultants will be based in Kathmandu, with temporary offices \n                                                 \n8  ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (ADB. 1998. Policy on Indigenous Peoples\u2013Asian Development Bank. Manila) \nrequires the Borrower to prepare such a plan, if indigenous peoples are likely to be affected significantly or \nadversely by a project. The plan provides the framework for maximizing project benefits to indigenous peoples and \nmitigating any negative effects.  ", "  5\nat border points if necessary. The Government will provide suitable office accommodation at the \nborder points, together with support staff, communications equipment, and vehicle transport.   \n \n16.     The TA will be implemented over 6 months, between January and July 2004. A firm of \nconsultants will be required to provide a total of 11 person-months of international and 18 \nperson-months of domestic consultancy. The firm will be responsible for subregional transport \nsector analysis; institutional assessment and identification of areas of reforms needed; study of \nthe technical and economic feasibility of all subprojects, including road, bridge, and ICD and \ncustoms station engineering; financial analysis for ICDs; and analysis of customs and ICD \noperations procedures.  The  consulting  firm will also be responsible for coordinating overall TA \nimplementation. As the scope of component to enhance the border facilities may be refined after \nthe SCOES findings become available, the firm will be responsible to closely coordinate with the  \nSASEC secretariat, TA teams (para. 12 [ix]) and the Trade and Private Sector Working Group. \nThe firm will develop a work program within 3 weeks of commencement of the TA or of the \navailability of the SCOES findings, whichever comes later. The program will include confirmation \nof the proposed terms of reference and identification of required additional expertise, person-\nmonths, outputs, and a working schedule for ADB approval. Individual international (for about 2 \nperson-months)  and  individual  domestic  (for  about  6  person-months)  consultants  will  be \nresponsible for environment impact assessment.  Individual international (4 person-months) and  \ndomestic  (6  person-months)  consultants  will  be  responsible  for  poverty  and  the  social \nassessment, resettlement plan, and indigenous people\u2019s development plan (if required).  The \nconsulting firm will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality; and cost-based selection procedures, and \nthe individual consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. All consultants should assist ADB missions in processing the proposed Project \nloan, including the loan fact-finding and appraisal missions.  Outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are attached as Appendix 4.  \n \n17.  The consultants will submit an inception report no later than 4 weeks after commencing \ntheir services, focusing on the work program and selection of subprojects; an interim report, 3 \nmonths after TA inception; and a draft final report, 5 months after commencement. A tripartite \nmeeting between the Government, consultants, and ADB will be held in Kathmandu, chaired by \nMPPW, to review the draft final report. Within 3 weeks after the meeting, a final report, in a \nformat acceptable to ADB, will be submitted, incorporating all comments received on the draft \nfinal report from the Government and ADB.  \n \n \nIV.

Reducing costs and transit times is expected to result in \nsignificant savings to importers and exporters.  Cost savings will be passed on to Nepal consumers as the \nprice of imported goods is expected to decrease.  Cost savings will make Nepal manufacturers and \nagricultural  products  more  competitive  and  lead  to  increased  exports  to  India  and  third  countries.  \nImprovements in customs procedures will increase the collection efficiency of customs revenues.
