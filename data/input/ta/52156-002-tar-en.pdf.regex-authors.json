The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will prepare the proposed Integrated Water \nProductivity Improvement Project. The project will improve water management within the selected \nriver basins and irrigation subprojects will be improved under the project with the following outputs \nand interventions. Output 1: resource management systems improved, will (i) strengthen river \nbasin coordination and management by undertaking river basin mapping and modelling and \npreparing river basin management plans; (ii) increase hydrological and meteorological data \ncollection and strengthening the national hydrology archive; and (iii) provide modern asset \nmanagement  tools  and  procedures.  Output  2:  irrigation  infrastructure  modernized,  will \n(i) implement  irrigation  modernization  works;  (ii)  expand  irrigation  systems  where  there  is \nadequate water availability; and (iii) increase overall water storage capacity. Output 3: modern \ncrop production and marketing promoted, will assist farmers with modern best practices for \nimproving on-farm water management and increase their crop productivity by (i) implementing \ntraining programs for farmers (including targeting women farmers) and government staff on \nimproved water management and crop production; (ii) establishing new demonstration farms; and \n(iii) strengthening farmer organizations. These outputs will result in the following outcome: water \nproductivity in irrigated lands of selected river basins increased. The project will be aligned with \nthe following impact: food security and water use efficiency enhanced recognizing the impact of \nclimate change.1 The Country Operations Business Plan for Sri Lanka 2019\u20132021 includes a \nTRTA for approval in 2018 and an investment loan amounting to $170 million from ADB\u2019s regular \nordinary capital resources for Board consideration in 2020.2 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The proposed TRTA is required to develop the project concept to feasibility level and \nsupport the recruitment and management of the project readiness financing (PRF) consultants \n(PRFC). The objectives of the TRTA are to: (i) assist the government to select priority river basins \nto be covered under the project; (ii) develop hydrologic models and river basin management plans \nin two sample river basins; (iii) identify representatives sample subprojects representing at least \n30% of the works and prepare subproject pre-feasibility and feasibility studies; (iv) assess the \nirrigation and agriculture sectors policy and institutional frameworks, identify gaps associated with \nachieving the project objectives and improvement recommendations; (v) update irrigation design \nguidelines to address modern best practices, farmers evolving needs, and resilience to climate \nchange; (vi) prepare draft loan documents for ADB Board consideration; (vii) prepare consulting \npackages  for  the  remaining  subproject  feasibility  studies,  detailed  designs,  construction \nsupervision, project implementation support, farmers agriculture support services and institutional \nstrengthening;  (viii)  undertake  social  and  environmental  impact  assessments  in  sample \nsubproject locations, prepare safeguard and gender related documents; and (ix) support the early \nrecruitment of the PRFC and their management for meeting the project readiness criteria. \nB.
