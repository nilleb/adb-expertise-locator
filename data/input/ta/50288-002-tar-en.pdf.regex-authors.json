THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  To realize the goal of accelerated infrastructure development, the Government of the \nPhilippines (the Government) requested urgent assistance from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to supplement capacity and improve systems and procedures for project development and \nproject monitoring. In response, ADB is working with the Government on a proposed Infrastructure \nPreparation and Innovation Facility Project (the proposed project), which will support two key \nagencies responsible for national public infrastructure, the Department of Public Works and \nHighways (DPWH) and the Department of Transportation (DOTr). The project will assist the \nGovernment in making objective investment decisions, provide a robust project pipeline ready for \nimplementation, and assist with the preparation activities to fill the infrastructure gap of the \ncountry.1 This paper outlines a technical assistance (TA) grant, proposed to help develop the \ncapacity of the two agencies to implement the ensuring Project. It is categorized as a transaction \nTA grant. \n \n2.  The proposed project is included in the Country Operations and Business Plan 2017\u2013\n2019.2 The impact will be infrastructure development accelerated.3 It has the following outcome: \ndelivery and quality of public infrastructure projects improved. The project comprises four outputs: \n(i) road and bridge projects prepared; (ii) water projects prepared; (iii) rail, public transport, port, \nand airport project prepared; and (iv) a project monitoring system prepared.  \n \n3.  A TA loan is proposed as the financing modality for the proposed project. It is estimated \nto cost $114.06 million; of which $100 million will be financed by ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \nThe Government will finance $14.06 million for taxes and duties and financial charges during \nimplementation.4 The major expenditure items, approximately 93% of the total cost (including \ntaxes and duties), are for consulting services to support the government project preparation and \nimplementation activities for public sector investments.5 \n \n4.  The TA loan fact-finding mission was held during 24 February\u201314 March 2017. The \nGovernment concurred with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, and \ncost financing arrangements. The cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 1. \n \n5.   Besides  enhancing  planning  and  implementation  capacities  in  the  agencies,  the \ntransaction TA grant will also support the development and establishment of the infrastructure \nproject monitoring and management system in the National Economic and Development Authority \n(NEDA), Department of Finance (DOF), DOTr, and DPWH. \n \n6.  The transaction TA grant will be split into two phases; phase 1 will ensure smooth and \ntimely start-up of the proposed project and phase 2 will implement a project management and \nmonitoring system. The TA grant will directly support the Government and the proposed project \nby: (i) screening and prioritizing projects for inclusion in the proposed project; (ii) enhancing the \ncurrent management and monitoring system and structures, (iii) identifying key specialist support \nto augment capacity in DOF, NEDA, DPWH, and DOTr (to be completed under phase 1), and (iv) \n                                                \n1  The Government\u2019s official request for ADB\u2019s assistance was sent on 8 February 2017. \n2  ADB. 2016.

The implementing agencies will \nbe DPWH and DOTr. \n ", "2 \nsupporting in the implementation of a project management and monitoring system as part of the \nBuild Build Build program (to be completed under phase 2).6  \n \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n7.  The TA will ensure the most effective support is derived from the proposed project by \nassisting DOTr and DPWH in project screening and prioritization. The selected projects will be \nthe highest priority of the Government in terms of development needs and priorities, as well as \nspecialist advice required. The identification as well as initial work on transformational projects \nsuch  as  large  bridges,  tunnels,  innovative  transport  solutions  and  flood  mitigation,  and \nmanagement will require specialist support to augment capacity within DOTr and DPWH in the \ndevelopment of project management and monitoring system. \n \n8.  The TA will establish the implementation structure for the proposed project, to ensure \nreadiness of DOTr and DPWH. The TA will also ensure that DOF, through DPWH and DOTr, is \nable to meet loan covenant reporting requirements for the proposed project. The TA will prepare \nand establish project management and monitoring systems and assist in the implementation of \nthese systems within NEDA.   \n \n9.  The TA will enable DOTr and DPWH to meet an urgent need for specialized assistance to \npush forward their ongoing sophisticated infrastructure projects. International experts can be \nsourced only in exceptional cases under existing national procurement systems.7 The specialized \nexpertise provided by the TA will directly supplement skills and innovations urgently required by \nDOTr and DPWH to undertake pre-investment activities to be financed under the proposed project. \n \n10.  A series of consultation missions were conducted in March and April 2017 with DOF, \nNEDA, DOTr, and DPWH to discuss the requirements of the TA and how this relates and supports \nthe  proposed  project  and  project  management  and  monitoring  systems.8 The  Government \nconcurred with the outputs, activities, implementation arrangements, cost financing arrangements, \nand terms of references (TOR) for consultants.9 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n \n11.  Output  1:  Project  screening  and  prioritization.  The  TA  will  assist  NEDA  in  the \nscreening of projects for inclusion in the proposed project in the context of the government\u2019s \noverall infrastructure development program based on the Philippines Development Plan and \nPublic Investment Program. This will ensure timely start-up of the proposed project and that \nmaximum benefits are derived by selecting those projects that would benefit the Government \nmost in terms of priority, complexity and requirement with respect to international expertise. \n                                                \n6  http://www.build.gov.ph/ \n7  According to Sections 23 and 24 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9184 \n(known as \u201cGovernment Procurement Reform Act\u201d), the eligibility criteria for the procurement of infrastructure projects \nand consulting services require prospective bidders to be: (i) Duly licensed Filipino citizens or sole proprietorships; \nor (ii) Corporations duly organized under the laws of the Philippines, and of which at least 75% (60% for procurement \nof consulting services) of the outstanding capital stock belongs to citizens of the Philippines.

Output 2: Development of management systems and structures. The TA will assess \nthe current infrastructure program and project development systems and procedures within DOF, \nNEDA, DOTr and DPWH and assist the agencies to prepare project management and monitoring \nmanuals  and  work  flow  charts  for  accelerated  project  preparation  and  approval,  using \ninternational best practices and experts in the areas of project management. Output 4 outlined \nbelow will establish the project management system and associated documentation. \n \n13.  Output 3: Specialist support to augment capacity in DOF, DOTr, and DPWH. The TA \nwill augment capacity within DOF, DOTr, and DPWH and identify skill gaps in the executing and \nimplementing agencies. The skill gap analysis will be used to determine needs for in-service \ntraining, and/or support from consultant specialists to enhance capacity and expedite project \npreparation and implementation activities.  \n \n14.  Output 4: Implementation of the project management and monitoring system. The \nimplementation of the project management and monitoring system prepared under output 2 will \nbe delivered under this output. Output 4 will run for 4 years and assist the key oversight agencies, \nDOF and NEDA in project preparation and approval phases of the Government\u2019s infrastructure \nprograms. A team will be embedded within DOF and NEDA to implement the project management \nand monitoring system. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $5,500,000, of which $5,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others).10 The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of staff, offices, permissions, logistical assistance, access to \ninformation and reports, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.
