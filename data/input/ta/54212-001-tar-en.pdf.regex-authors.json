INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) developing member countries (DMCs) enhance their coastal resilience through nature-\nbased and integrated solutions. This includes (i) supporting the preparation of integrated plans \nand investments for building coastal resilience through nature-based and sustainable solutions; \n(ii)  identifying  the  necessary  policies  and  investments  to  enhance  coastal  resilience  and \nsustainably manage coastal ecosystems, including identifying sustainable coastal livelihood and \neconomic development opportunities with special attention to vulnerable groups and women\u2019s \nempowerment; (iii) preparing projects and investments; (iv) improving the understanding of \ncoastal resilience solutions know-how and the role and value of coastal ecosystems; and (v) \npromoting regional cooperation on coastal and marine ecosystems as regional public goods. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the 2021 Management-approved results-based work plan of the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC). It is aligned with Strategy \n2030 operational priorities on tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nenhancing environmental sustainability, accelerating progress in gender equality, and fostering \nregional cooperation, especially in relation to regional public goods.1 The TA supports the ADB \nAction Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue Economies2 and Sustainable Development \nGoals 5, 11, 13 and 14.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Coastal cities, communities, and island nations in Asia and the Pacific are highly exposed \nto climate and disaster related shocks and stresses.4 Of the top 10 cities in population exposure \nto extreme natural hazards worldwide, nine are in Asia, a region with more than 460 million people \nliving in low-elevation coastal zones and which experiences average daily losses of $200 million \nfrom disasters caused by geophysical and hydrometeorological hazards.5 Coastal communities \nin small island developing states (SIDS), even if less populated, are among the most exposed \nand vulnerable to coastal flooding, erosion, and rising sea levels. A person in the Pacific SIDS is \nthree to five times more at risk of exposure to a natural hazard than those in other parts of the \nregion, and one-third of all inhabitants in the Pacific SIDS live only a few meters above sea level.6 \n \n4.  Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of natural hazards, which affect \nAsia  and  the  Pacific\u2019s  coastal  cities,  communities,  and  island  nations.  Under  the  current \ngreenhouse gas emissions scenarios, mean sea levels could rise by more than one meter by \n2100.7 Such a sea level rise could flood entire coastal cities and communities in atolls, expose \nhundreds of millions of people to the risks of more severe and frequent flooding, and increase \ncoastal erosion, land loss, and salinization. In addition, coastal populations are projected to face \n \n1  ADB. Sep 2019. Stretegy 2030 Operational Plan Overview. \n2  ADB. 2019.

Contribution of \nWorking Groups I, II and III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. IPCC, \nGeneva, Switzerland, 151 pp. Sea level rise projections from the IPCC fifth assessment report suggest that sea \nlevels could rise up to 1 meter by 2100. However, work that has emerged since demonstrates that sea level rise of \ngreater than 1 meter by 2100 is conceivable. \n ", "2 \n(i) increased intensity of tropical cyclones with increased precipitation and higher extreme sea \nlevels caused by greater storm surges; (ii) increased wave heights across the tropical eastern \nPacific; (iii) increased frequency, duration, spatial extent, and intensity of marine heatwaves; and \n(iv) increased frequency of extreme El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events, likely intensifying existing \nhazards.8 \n \n5.  Critical coastal ecosystems that protect coastlines are rapidly degraded or lost, increasing \nexposure and recovery times. Healthy coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangrove forests, \ncoastal wetlands, beaches, and dunes are natural buffers that provide a first line of defense for \ncoastal cities, communities, and infrastructure. They dissipate wave energy and storm surges, \nprotect against erosion and flooding, and help buffer the impacts of sea level rise. They also \nsupport food security, livelihoods, and the tourism and fisheries economies; provide non-market \nbenefits; and are regional public goods.9 However, these ecosystems are rapidly declining. The \nmain  drivers  of  decline  are  unsustainable  development  and  practices  (e.g.,  clearance  of \nmangroves, drainage of wetlands for agriculture, overfishing, destructive fishing methods, mining, \npollution,  and  urban  expansion),  though  climate  change  impacts  (e.g.,  ocean  warming, \nacidification,  loss  of  oxygen,  and  salinity  intrusion)  are  expected  to  have  larger  negative \nconsequences in the near future. \n \n6.  The degradation of coastal ecosystems and increased recurrence and severity of natural \nhazards are increasing the risk to coastal communities. Within these communities, poor and \nmarginalized groups, who often live in the most exposed areas along coasts and are most \ndependent on local natural resources, are the most affected. When an event damages an already \nstressed ecosystem, this further threatens food security and incomes, prolonging the period of \npost-disaster recovery.10 Women, in particular, have been identified as the most vulnerable social \ngroup, followed by children, the elderly, and disabled.11 Women play a critical role in building \ncoastal resilience as decision-makers, stakeholders, and educators, but they continue to be an \nuntapped resource because of lack of access to resources, training, and decision-making.12 \n \n7.  Integrated nature-based approaches consist of actions to protect, sustainably manage, \nand restore natural or modified ecosystems to address societal challenges such as exposure to \nnatural hazards, effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and \n \n8  IPCC. 2019.

Asia and the Pacific\u2019s coastal and marine ecosystems, are a transboundary resource which impact cities \nand communities in multiple countries: they host significant biodiversity; provide habitats for economically significant \nmigratory species and charismatic megafauna that support tourism; and act as spawning grounds and nurseries for \nfish species that support fisheries and food security. The total value of the services produced by marine and coastal \necosystems is valued at $145 trillion per year. \n10 J.P. Terry and J. R. Goff. 2012. The special vulnerability of Asia\u2013Pacific islands to natural hazards. In J.P. Terry and \nJ. Goff, eds. Natural Hazards in the Asia-Pacific Region: Recent Advances and Emerging Concepts. London: \nGeological Society of London. \n11 Women constitute the majority of the world\u2019s poor and are more dependent for their livelihood on natural resources. \nThey face social, economic, and political barriers that limit their coping capacity once an event damages the \necosystem. Also, women are generally responsible for food production, the collection of water, management of \nnatural resources, and care of children and elderly. When an event damages an ecosystem, this further threatens \nfood security and incomes via livelihoods failure, food and water contamination, and shortages of clean water, among \nothers. This will force women to move further to obtain natural resources and increase the likelihood of exposure to \ndiseases, hindering women\u2019s possibilities to improve their life conditions. Flooding will also increase deaths, injuries, \nand exposure to infectious diseases to women when performing the duties of water collection and food harvesting. \n12 International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 2015. IUCN Issues Brief: Gender and Climate Change. \n ", "3 \nbiodiversity  benefits. 13 While  traditional  approaches  in  infrastructural  development  involve \nconstructed and artificial \u201cgrey\u201d structures (based on cement as construction material), nature-\nbased solutions encompass natural, green, and integrated infrastructure. Nature-based solutions \ncan increase the resilience of coastal communities while unfolding multiple economic, societal, \ngender responsive, and climate change mitigation co-benefits.14 However, coastal planning and \ndevelopment does not usually adopt such approaches, mainly because of: \n \n(i)  Low awareness of the critical role of natural resources in resilience. The \nbenefits of coastal ecosystems are rarely quantified and accounted for in coastal \nprotection, which means decisions are made without fully recognizing their value. \n(ii)  The perception that grey infrastructure is technically and financially more \neffective than nature-based solutions. Grey infrastructure and nature-based \nsolutions operate and deliver benefits in different temporal and spatial scales. \nThese scales are not usually taken into account when comparing both types of \nsolutions, which is detrimental for nature-based solutions.15 \n(iii)  Lack of funding. Ecosystem management is generally underfunded and a lower \npriority. Further, coastal ecosystems are regional and global public goods with \nmajor economic benefits but without direct revenue-generating models, because \nthere is usually a lack of know-how in setting up payment for ecosystem services \nmechanisms. Because they are not viewed as infrastructure, they are less likely to \nreceive funding from hazard mitigation budgets. \n(iv)  Capacity  constraints  and  limited  scientific  knowledge  specific  to  local \ncontexts. There is still uncertainty about the magnitude and timeline of future risks, \nand coastal decision-makers often lack the expertise, data, and resources needed \nto create and implement long-term, comprehensive, and flexible plans to adapt to \ndifferent scenarios.16 \n(v)  Weak governance and institutional arrangements for integrated decision-\nmaking. In many contexts, governance arrangements are fragmented across \nadministrative boundaries, sectors, and countries, since multi-country coordination \nrequires  greater  capacity  and  trust  between  nations.  This  leads  to  a  siloed \napproach, preventing integrated responses. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: resilience of coastal communities, cities, \ninfrastructure, and ecosystems enhanced.17 The TA will have the following outcome: DMC coastal \nresilience programs, plans, and actions improved.18 \n \n \n13 This definition is drawn from the IUCN nature-based solutions framework. In 2020, IUCN launched the IUCN Global \nStandard for nature-based solutions, which provides clear parameters for defining nature-based solutions and a \ncommon framework to help benchmark progress. Such a framework is essential to increase the scale and impact of \nthe nature-based solutions approach, prevent unanticipated negative outcomes or misuse, and help funding \nagencies, policy makers, and other stakeholders assess the effectiveness of interventions.  \n14 Restoration of mangroves and wetlands, green roofs, or sand engines are some examples of nature-based solutions. \n15 For example, from an engineering standpoint, the structural integrity and functionality of nature-based solutions tends \nto increase over time. The opposite occurs for grey infrastructures, which might start with high structural integrity that \ndiminish over time. \n16 Coast Adapt. 2017.

Output  1:  Strategic  plans,  policies  and  programs  to  build  coastal  resilience \nprepared.19 The TA will support the preparation of long-term integrated plans for building coastal \nresilience  through  integrated  nature-based  and  sustainable  solutions,  strengthening  the \ngovernance and identifying necessary policies and investments to enhance coastal resilience and \nsustainably  manage  coastal  ecosystems,  including  the  development  of  sustainable  coastal \nlivelihood and economic development programs, and with special attention to the poor and \nmarginalized groups.20 Specifically, the TA will support the Government of Vanuatu to prepare a \ncoastal resilience roadmap for Fatumaru Bay (Port Vila), promoting the use of nature-based \nsolutions and identifying the necessary investments to strengthen the resilience of the Port Vila \ncoastal area, including the identification of necessary measures to sustainably manage Fatumaru \ncoastal ecosystems to promote nature-based coastal livelihoods and economic development \nopportunities, with special attention to vulnerable groups and women\u2019s empowerment.21 The \ncoastal resilience roadmap for Fatumaru Bay will build on the findings and work previously done \nduring the preparation and implementation of the Greater Port Vila Urban Resilience Project in \nVanuatu.  In  the  Republic  of  the  Marshall  Islands,  the  TA  will  support  the  preparation  of \nconservation and resource management plans for at least two atolls following the Reimaanlok \nProcess, consolidate and standardize all the data produced during the process to identify potential \npatterns (stressors, responses, impacts, resilience), provide complementary findings for the \npreparation of the Marshall Islands national adaptation plan, and strengthen the link and feed of \ninformation from the community level to the national level.22 In Indonesia, the TA will support the \nrevision of Indonesia\u2019s National Flood Works Guidelines, which include coastal flooding, and will \nsupport and advise the government in their upgrading. \n \n10.  Output 2: Nature-based and integrated coastal resilience investments supported.23 \nBased on demand from operations departments and DMCs, the TA will support the identification \nand preparation of interventions to boost coastal resilience, helping accelerate investments, \nprioritizing activities that achieve multiple resilience benefits, and promoting multi-functional \ndesign and long-term sustainability of the interventions. Specifically, the TA will support the \npreparation of the Indonesia Flood Management and Coastal Protection in North Java Project24 \nby providing specialist support to enhance the use of nature-based solutions as part of the project \ndesign and to enhance the coastal resilience to climate change and to water-related disasters. In \nPakistan, the TA will support scoping and preparation of a technical assistance on strategic action \nplanning for the Sindh coastal region to support the planned Sindh Coastal Resilience Project, \nwhich aims to strengthen the resilience of livelihoods and infrastructure in the coastal area districts \nand provide strategic action planning for the coastal zone.25 In India, the TA will support the \n \n19 This output will be initially delivered in Indonesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Vanuatu. \n20 All TA activities will follow the IUCN Global Standard for nature-based solutions (footnote 13). \n21 This activity complements the additional financing being pursued under the Greater Port Vila Urban Resilience \nProject.

The preparation of the Maharashtra Coastal Resilience \nInvestment  Program  will  build  upon  the  findings  and  work  previously  done  during  the \nimplementation  of  the  India  Sustainable  Coastal  Protection  and  Management  Investment \nProgram26 and other work such as the preparation of the reference manual \u201cClimate Change \nAdaptation Guidelines for Coastal Protection and Management in India.\u201d In the Pacific, the TA will \nsupport project preparation to secure grant funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) \nunder the Pacific Island to Island Regional Project: Ocean Health for Ocean Wealth, which will be \nused to support Pacific Department for investment readiness for at least two projects, addressing \ncoastal and marine management and resilience.  \n \n11.  Output 3: Knowledge, regional cooperation, and financing for building coastal \nresilience improved.27 The TA will advance the understanding of coastal resilience solutions \nknow-how\u2014including the use of nature-based approaches and the role and value of coastal \necosystems, including their economic dimension and maintenance\u2014through the preparation of \nknowledge products and the preparation and delivery of specific trainings and capacity building \nevents. The TA will encourage regional cooperation on coastal and marine ecosystems as \nregional public goods. For this purpose, the TA will work with regional programs and specifically \nwith the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East Association of Southeast Asian \nNations Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), with the Coalition of Low-Lying Atoll Nations on Climate \nChange  (CANCC),  and  other  cooperative  platforms  such  as  the  South  Asia  Cooperative \nEnvironment Program, to strengthen regional knowledge sharing, promote best approaches, and \nfoster the dialogue among participating DMCs on how to scale up successful initiatives to regional \nlevels, encouraging a more regional approach to dealing with coastal ecosystems.28 The TA will \nsupport BIMP-EAGA environment strategies under Vision 2025: \u201cAddress the impacts of climate \nchange  through  adaptation  and  mitigation\u201d  and  \u201cAdopt  sustainable  management  of  natural \nresources and ecosystems.\u201d29 Particularly, the TA will support these strategies through the \norganization of the Green Cities Forum, which will focus on coastal cities and sustainable blue \neconomies for coastal cities, and enhancing BIMP-EAGA capacity building program by providing \ntraining  and  capacity  building  on  coastal  resilience  through  nature-based  solutions  for  the \nparticipating countries. The TA will also strengthen the coordination role and capacities of CANCC \nand will organize atoll dialogues and capacity building events to strengthen regional cooperation \nand knowledge sharing among atoll nations, which is one of the main goals of CANCC. It is also \nexpected that the TA will support the implementation of the Coral Reef Insurance Initiative once \nthis innovative financing instrument gets approved. However, this activity is expected to be linked \nto the TA through additional financing at a later stage. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,994,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7 and TASF-other sources, equally \ndistributed), (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and \n \n26  ADB.
