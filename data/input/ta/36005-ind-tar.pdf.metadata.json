Introduction \n1.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Chhattisgarh  State  Roads  Sector  Development, \nfinanced by the Government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an amount of $800,000, was \napproved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 21 November 2002 to help prepare the \nChhattisgarh State Roads Development Sector Project (the Project) for ADB financing. The total \nTA cost is $1,000,000, with the government of Chhattisgarh (GOC) financing $200,000. The \nTA\u2019s main components are (i) project preparation; and (ii) institutional strengthening and policy \nreform.  The  TA  outputs  include  (i)  a  master  plan  for  road  sector  development  (MPRSD), \nincluding  prioritized  investment  needs  for  new  roads  and  upgrading  of  existing  roads  in \nChhattisgarh; (ii) feasibility studies, engineering, environmental and social impact studies, and \nbid documents for major upgrading works; and (iii) sector plans and an action plan to strengthen \nkey sector institutions, promote private sector participation, and improve road safety and road \nmaintenance.  \n \n2.  CPCS Transcom Ltd.1 and a team of individual consultants were engaged under the TA \nin 2003 to prepare a report on sector analysis and institutional development for the road sector \nin  Chhattisgarh;  to  undertake  feasibility,  engineering,  and  environmental  and  social  impact \nstudies; and to prepare bid documents for rehabilitation and major upgrading works, and the \nMPRSD. The consultants prepared sector analyses and action plans and undertook a feasibility \nstudy, together with environmental and social impact studies, for a 100-kilometer road stretch. \nThe Project2 was approved by ADB to support state road sector reforms and rehabilitation of the \nstate road network in Chhattisgarh. The Project will help GOC improve road sector management, \nand provide the capacity to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of road investments and \ndevelopment.  The  objective  will  be  achieved  by  (i)  improving  priority  state  roads  between \neconomic growth centers and rural areas; (ii) instituting measures to improve governance and \naccountability for road sector management; (iii) improving sector capability and building capacity \nfor  more  efficient  resource  and  asset  management;  and  (iv)  increasing  private  sector \nparticipation in road development and maintenance projects. The Project will complement the \nADB-financed Rural Roads Sector I Project3 in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Improved \nrural roads will not fully benefit the rural population unless the state highway and district road \nnetwork is improved. \n \n3.  The Chhattisgarh Infrastructure Development Corporation (CIDC) had been designated \nthe Executing Agency (EA) for the TA. It has been working closely with GOC\u2019s Public Works \nDepartment (PWD), which is the EA for the Project.  \n \n4.  After the contract with CPCS Transcom Ltd. was terminated, a team of consultants was \nengaged under the TA in 2004 to prepare the MPRSD, including prioritization of investment \nneeds for new roads and upgrading of existing roads. Apart from being a valuable planning tool \nfor  GOC,  the  MPRSD  will  provide  the  basis  for  selecting  candidate  road  subprojects  for \nrehabilitation under the Project. The MPRSD will identify the road sections to be improved \nthrough public\u2013private partnership. The consultants submitted the draft final report in June 2005; \nGOC  is  reviewing  it.  As  a  part  of  the  MPRSD,  a  road  database  has  been  created  on  a \n                                                 \n1  Owing to poor performance, the contract with CPCS Transcom Ltd., Canada, was suspended effective 1 October \n2003, and terminated effective 7 May 2004.  \n2  ADB. 2003.

", "2       \ngeographic information system (GIS) platform that GOC can use for effective management \ninformation and decision making. An individual consultant was engaged in June 2005 to help \nPWD and ADB in the review of project preparation, project appraisal, and the approval of \ncandidate subprojects under the Project, and the procurement of civil works contracts.  \n \nB.   Background \n \n5.  Chhattisgarh was created on 1 November 2000, following the bifurcation of Madhya \nPradesh. As had been with PWD, government of Madhya Pradesh, PWD, GOC is reaching the \ninstitutional and technical limits of its ability to manage the sector and investments in state \nroads. This, and the 10-year neglect of investment in road improvement and maintenance \nbefore the bifurcation, has caused serious deterioration of most state roads. Riding quality is \nmostly poor to very poor, undermining the long-term growth potential of the state\u2019s economy, \nincreasing transport capacity bottlenecks, and worsening transport services, including for the \nrural poor and tribal populations.  \n \n6.  When the state was created, GOC increased the allocated funds to improve roads. Road \nsector management must be improved to support GOC\u2019s initiatives. Better governance and \naccountability will improve the institutional and policy framework, and provide the capacity to \nensure that investments are implemented successfully and their impacts sustained. Road sector \ninvestment is expected to (i) help GOC significantly improve the connectivity of Chhattisgarh\u2019s \nroad network, thus directly supporting the state\u2019s economic growth; and (ii) help Chhattisgarh \nestablish a transparent and conducive environment for more competition and private sector \nparticipation. This, in turn, will ensure better infrastructure facilities and lower recurrent costs for \nroad maintenance over the medium and long term, allowing higher capital and expenditure for \npriority social sectors and poverty reduction. \n \n7.  To improve road sector management, GOC has taken up a study on privatization of the \nstate highways under the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) with World Bank \nassistance, and the Business Process Reengineering Study for PWD under the United Nations \nDevelopment Program (UNDP). GOC has appointed a consultant to computerize business \nprocesses in PWD. GOC has been requested to ensure that the objectives and scope under \nthese studies complement the Project\u2019s institutional reforms.  \n \n8.  To fund institutional strengthening and capacity building, the Government of India and \nthe state governments generally prefer TA grant funds and have been disinclined to access \nADB\u2019s market-based ordinary capital resources loans. Consequently, grant funding from the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom4 for TA has greatly helped the governments strengthen \ninstitutions, build capacity, and undertake pro-poor sector reforms that provide connectivity and \nefficient transport. ADB generally provides TA grants for institutional strengthening and capacity \nbuilding and had provided a TA grant funded by the Government of the United Kingdom for road \n                                                 \n4  Since India is not eligible for ADB\u2019s concessional lending window, the Asian Development Fund (ADF), ADB is \nunable to offer funds for capacity-building, social sector, and other poverty-focused projects at competitive rates to \nthe Government of India. However, India has access to concessional International Development Association funds \nfrom the World Bank, and from bilateral donors. Access to grant funds from the Government of the United Kingdom \nhas, therefore, been critical in enabling ADB to include and/or reinforce poverty-focused TA and loans in its India \nportfolio. ", "                                                      3\nsector reforms in conjunction with a loan for road rehabilitation5 in Madhya Pradesh in 2002. \nSuch a grant was not available when a similar loan to Chhattisgarh was approved.  \n \n9.  The Project provides for the engagement of consultants through loan proceeds. They will \nbe required to continue the policy dialogue carried out during the preparation of the Project and \nto identify policy areas that need to be improved. The consultants will help GOC build the \ninstitutional capacity to strengthen and develop state roads, and strengthen GOC\u2019s abilities in \nsector management.  \n \n10.  In  2004,  before  loan  signing,  GOC  requested  ADB  grant  funds  for  institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building. The request has been endorsed by the Government of \nIndia. In response to GOC\u2019s continued representations, in April 2005 ADB requested the UK \nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID)  for  an  increase  of  $1,600,000  to  cover \nconsulting services for institutional strengthening and capacity building in the road sector. DFID \nhas concurred with the ADB request. \n \n11.  In accordance with the loan documents, in 2004 PWD started engaging consultants for \ninstitutional development and capacity building, and will engage the consultants under the \nProject  from  the  loan  proceeds  if  the  grant  funds  are  not  available.  The  consultants  are \nexpected to be engaged by March 2006.  \n \n12.  ADB and GOC consider the ongoing TA to be immensely useful in analyzing the sector \nand in preparing plans for sector reforms and the MPRSD. As a more detailed version of the \nstrategic options studies undertaken for various states, the MPRSD will be a model to be shared \nwith other states. Institutional strengthening, capacity building, and sector reform, particularly in \nthe public sector, are the next steps. Using TA grants to fund consultants allows ADB to \nsupervise and monitor their outputs and services. Consensus on reform can then be built more \neffectively, within PWD and other state agencies, particularly the Finance Department. Grants \nfor such programs have ensured sustainable sector reforms.  \n \nC.   Proposed Increase in TA Amount and Enhanced Scope \n  1.  Objective and Scope  \n \n13.  The enhanced TA aims to fund the consulting services for institutional strengthening and \ncapacity building in the road sector, which is now being funded by the loan proceeds.  \n \n14.  The consulting services will help continue the policy dialogue with GOC in institutional \nreform, help PWD implement the reform under the Project, and establish highly effective road \nsector management. The TA consultants will be required to continue the policy dialogue carried \nout during the preparation of the Project and help GOC reform the road sector. Enhancing the \nTA will help GOC build the institutional capacity to strengthen and develop state roads, and \nstrengthen  its  abilities  in  sector  policy  formulation,  transport  planning,  project  financing, \ninvestment management, and social and environmental monitoring by introducing internationally \nrecognized principles of engineering; technical, financial, and economic analysis; and social and \nenvironmental impact assessment and management.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \nfor the Madhya Pradesh State Roads Sector Development Program. Manila (Loan 1958-IND, for $30 million and \n1959-IND, for $150 million). \n   ", "4       \n15.  The  goal  of  the  institutional  component  is  to  strengthen  Chhattisgarh  state  road \nmanagement by establishing an agency for road development (ARD) within PWD, introduce and \nimplement  effective  and  efficient  road  management  processes,  improve  the  skills  of  PWD \nemployees,  and  establish  a  sustainable  mechanism  to  ensure  adequate  funding  for  road \nmaintenance. Achieving this goal will significantly increase GOC\u2019s capacity to achieve other \nsocial and economic development goals. \n \n16.  The ARD will be fully operational and responsible for managing all state highways and \nselected  major  district  roads  in  Chhattisgarh.  It  will  be  transformed  into  a  dedicated  road \nauthority (DRA) by the end of the reform. The institutional component will be carried out in \nparallel  with  other  road  project  components  covering  preparation  and  construction  of  road \nimprovements by PWD.  \n \n17.  The services will (i) review the diagnosed deficiencies and bottlenecks in Chhattisgarh\u2019s \nroad  sector  development  planning  and  management,  and  road  maintenance  planning  and \nfinancing; and (ii) review the need for accountability and sustainable sector development; (iii) \nhelp PWD implement the policy action plan for institutional reform under the Project; (iv) help \nPWD establish the social and environmental monitoring unit; and (v) provide training programs, \nin the country and abroad, to disseminate findings and recommendations on further reforms and \ninstitutional improvements.  \n \n18.  The key components of the policy action plan for institutional reform under the Project \nrequire GOC to (i) implement its road policy and improve coordination among its road sector \nmanagement agencies; (ii) establish the ARD and transform it into a DRA by the end of the \nreform; (iii) introduce effective road monitoring, planning, and programming procedures in the \nARD; (iv) introduce procurement procedures for international competitive bidding in the ARD; (v) \nimprove quality management of construction and maintenance; (vi) increase the ARD\u2019s capacity \nand efficiency through outsourcing; (vii) establish environmental assessment, social analysis, \nand  resettlement  planning  capabilities  in  the  ARD;  (viii)  establish  computerized  project \nmonitoring and financial accounting systems in the ARD; (ix) implement a human resource \ndevelopment  program  to  increase  the  ARD\u2019s  technical  capacity;  (x)  provide  the  ARD  with \nequipment for effective road management; (xi) implement a road safety program; (xii) ensure \nadequate  funding  of  road  maintenance;  and  (xiii)  improve  road  transport  services.  The \nconsultants will help GOC implement the policy action plan.  \n \n19.  Training programs abroad will be designed and organized to expose senior government \nofficials and key management staff of PWD to good governance in road sector management, \nalternative techniques for financial and economic analysis, resource mobilization, commercial \noperation and privatization of road operations, diversification of road maintenance financing, \nsocial impact assessment, and environmental management. The scope will cover the entire \nreform  process,  from  the  setting  up  of  the  ARD  during  the  transition  period  of  PWD\u2019s \nreengineering, to the transformation of the ARD into a DRA. The terms of reference for the \nconsulting services are in Appendix 1.  \n \n  2.  Costs and Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The proposed enhancement will require about 33 person-months of international and \nabout 119 person-months of domestic consultants with expertise in governance and sector \npolicy, transport economics, road engineering, road safety, procurement, financial analysis, \nproject  financing,  financial  accounting  and  management,  and  social  and  environmental \nmanagement.  The  proposed  enhancement  will  provide  training  in  these  areas  and  the ", "                                                      5\nequipment for TA implementation. The total cost of the proposed enhancement is $2,000,000 \nequivalent, comprising $844,994 in foreign exchange costs and $1,155,006 equivalent in local \ncurrency costs. An amount of $1,600,000, comprising entire foreign exchange cost of $844,994 \nand $755,006 equivalent of local currency costs will be financed by the proposed increase in the \nTA grant by the Government of the United Kingdom. GOC will continue to provide counterpart \nservices  and  facilities,  including  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  transport,  and \nadministrative  resources.  GOC\u2019s  contribution  will  increase  by  $400,000  equivalent  in  local \ncurrency costs. The total TA cost will be increased to $3,000,000. The revised cost estimate for \nthe TA is in Appendix 2. Consulting services will be provided for 36 months, beginning in March \n2006.  \n \n21.  As the consulting services for institutional strengthening and capacity building are being \nfunded through loan proceeds, PWD started to engage consultants in 2004 using ADB\u2019s quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The report on the evaluation of technical proposals submitted by PWD for ADB \napproval was reviewed by the Consultants Selection Committee (CSC) in July 2005. The CSC \nwas informed that ADB approval was being requested to fund the consulting services under a \nTA grant instead. The CSC suggested that the request for approval of the increase in TA \namount and enhanced scope should also include a request to allow the EA to continue the \nselection process. This request is necessary as ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(para. 2.01) states that the consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB for TA activities \nthat are financed by ADB\u2019s own resources or by another institution. DFID has concurred with the \nproposal for the selection of the consultants for the enhanced TA by the EA. The CSC has \napproved the report on combined evaluation of technical and financial proposals submitted by \nPWD in October 2005. It is proposed that ADB will negotiate and sign the contract with the \nconsultants and will continue to administer the enhanced TA.  \n \n22.  The original TA closing date of 31 October 2003 was extended to 30 June 2006. A \nfurther extension to 30 April 2009 is proposed for the implementation of the enhanced TA scope \nthrough the increase in TA amount. The loan closing date of July 2009 for the Project would \nallow sufficient time to implement the TA and fulfill the policy action plan for institutional reform. \n \n23.  As the PWD is the EA for the Project, PWD is proposed to be the EA for the enhanced \nTA. This would facilitate expeditious and effective implementation of the Project as well as of the \nenhanced TA, as institutional strengthening and capacity building have to be done within PWD \nitself. CIDC, the current EA for the TA, has no further activities under the TA.  \n \n24.  Consequent  to  the  increase  in  the  TA  amount,  the  Project  will  have  a  surplus  of \n$1,600,000. Under the sector loan modality, the loan surplus could be reallocated and utilized to \nfund additional road rehabilitation works through a minor change in the project scope.  \n \nD.  The President\u2019s Recommendation \n \n25.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) the increase in the TA amount by \n$1,600,000 from the Government of the United Kingdom, and the enhancement of TA scope; (ii) \nthe extension of the TA closing date to 30 April 2009; (iii) the designation of PWD as the EA for \nthe TA; (iv) selection of consultants for the enhanced TA by the EA using procedures allowed \nunder the Project; and (v) continued administration by ADB of the increased TA amount from \nthe Government of the United Kingdom. \n   ", "6      Appendix 1 \n  \nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES FOR INSTITUTIONAL \nSTRENGTHENING AND CAPACITY BUILDING FOR  \nTHE CHHATTISGARH STATE ROAD SECTOR \n \nA.
