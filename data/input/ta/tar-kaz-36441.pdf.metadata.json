", "I.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Kazakhstan requested advisory technical assistance (TA) from the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  improve  environmental  monitoring  and  information \nmanagement system for sustainable use of agricultural land. The TA1 is included in the country \nstrategy and program (2003) for Kazakhstan. The Government and ADB agreed to include the TA \nin the Pilot Study for Delegation of Consultant Recruitment and Supervision under Technical \nAssistance to Executing Agencies (Pilot Study). An ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Kazakhstan \nin May 2004 and held discussions with key officials of relevant government agencies. During the \ndiscussions, understanding was reached on the TA\u2019s objectives, scope, terms of reference for \nconsultants,  cost  estimates,  implementation  arrangements,  and  pilot  study  implementation \nprocedures. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.   Agriculture is a significant sector of non-oil production in Kazakhstan, accounting for \nalmost 18% of its gross domestic product in 2003. Forty-four percent of its population live in rural \nareas. Among the Central Asian countries, Kazakhstan is the largest and its considerable land \nresources  have  remarkable  potential  for  agricultural  development.2  About  66%  of  its  land, \nhowever,  suffers  from  degradation  and  threats  of  desertification,  soil  erosion,  soil \ndehumidification,  and  salinization  are  increasing.  The  main  causes  of  land  degradation  are \nunsustainable  land  and  water  management  practices,  including  overgrazing,  poor  water \nmanagement  in  extensive  irrigation  systems,  and  inadequate  drainage  systems.  The  main \neconomic  consequences  include  reduced  crop  production,  decreased  cattle  stock  and \nproductivity,  decreased  export  capacity  in  agriculture  products,  and  stagnant  food  and  light \nindustries. Lack of income diversification, decreased farm and rural household incomes, and \nincreased  rural  poverty  are  directly  linked  to  land  degradation  in  many  of  the  agricultural \nprovinces. Land degradation has become a major factor constraining economic development, and \nreversing this trend is an essential ingredient in enhancing the living standards of the rural \npopulation. \n \n3.  The Government is aware of the problem and has developed a series of strategies to \naddress it. The Long-term Strategy of Development of Kazakhstan Till 2030 outlines long-term \ngoals to improve rural living standards and environmental safety. The State Program of Rural \nDevelopment of Kazakhstan 2004\u20132010 emphasizes the development of rural settlements in \nareas with potential for sustainable income and employment growth under a market economy to \nencourage  migration  of  communities  from  regions  that  have  limited  prospects  for  economic \ngrowth or are environmentally hazardous. The Concept of Rational Use and Protection of Land \nResources for 1994\u20131995 and for the Period Till 2010 issued by the Government identifies three \nstages in improving land management, namely, improvement in land tax policy, implementation of \nland reform, and maintenance of state land cadastre and land monitoring. The 2002 National \nAction Plan to Combat Desertification and the Concept of Ecological Security 2004\u20132015 both \nemphasize  the  need  for  a  cross-sector  approach  to  implement  programs  to  combat \ndesertification, and recommend activities to be implemented during 2002 and 2011, including \ndevelopment  of  a  methodology  for  land  use  analysis,  establishment  of  a  monitoring  and \ninformation management system, and implementation of pilot projects to control desertification. \n \n4.  While Kazakhstan has adequate strategies for sustainable use of land resources, the \nprocess of translating them into local policies and specific programs and projects has been slower \n                                                 \n1\n The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 4 March 2004. \n2\n   The total area of Kazakhstan territory is 272.5 million hectares (ha), of which 222 million ha is agricultural lands. ", "2 \nand less effective than expected. Among others, inadequate institutional capacity to implement \nthese strategies is a major challenge. The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MOEP) has \nrealized that the gap between the extent of sustainable land use commitments made by the \nGovernment and the institutional capacity to implement them is getting wider. This is mainly \nbecause  the  Government  has  limited  experience  in  coordinating  complex  environmental \nmanagement policy across various government agencies, lacks operational mechanisms and \nprocedures to introduce environmental safeguards into agricultural and land management policies \nand activities, and has inadequate knowledge and information to meet the changing farming \nneeds for sustainable land use. Capacity building and institutional development at local levels are \nparticularly  needed  to  address  the  multifaceted  and  cross-sector  land  management  issues. \nOblast and rayon officials in charge of agriculture and land planning are typically with science and \nengineering backgrounds and lack skills and knowledge needed to address a broad range of \nmulti-sectoral land degradation issues. Local environmental agencies also lack skills to deal with \nagricultural and land management concerns as their current tasks primarily relate to industrial \npollution issues.  \n \n5.  Overlapping functions between various government agencies responsible for different \naspects of agricultural policies and land management and unclear mandates often make decision \nmaking and implementation of decisions related to sustainable land use difficult in Kazakhstan. It \nis difficult to obtain and compile relevant monitoring data from various sources. There is no \nmechanism for comprehensive data analysis. Also, Kazakhstan lack an information management \nsystem that various agencies can share as a common basis to support cost-effective, cross-\nsector policy innovations and measures to address worsening land degradation.  \n \n6.  Lack  of  an  effective  monitoring  and  information  management  system  is  not  a  new \nproblem. Information related to environmental and land management has deteriorated since \nindependence. The most pressing need, however, is not simply to collect data but to review the \nrelevance of the data currently generated and reform it to meet the changing needs for integrated \npolicy development and program or project preparation. Often, data were gathered without asking \nfundamental questions about the purposes and benefits of the efforts and therefore had limited \nvalue for supporting decision making, program design, or other practical needs. In addition, lack \nof data compatibility, comparability, reliability, and accessibility that are required to link various \nsectoral networks into an integrated information management system is another problem. For \nexample,  criteria  for  monitoring  the  land  degradation  process  applied  by  various  land \nmanagement agencies are inconsistent and do not comply with the United Nations Convention to \nCombat  Desertification  (UNCCD)  indicators.  Thus,  it  is  difficult  to  integrate  some  planned \nactivities within the framework of actions on combating desertification. The Government launched \nUnified Information Program 2001\u20132006 to deal with this problem.  \n \n7.  Environmental auditing as part of the monitoring and information management system for \nsustainable land use is necessary to facilitate the implementation of national strategies and plans \nfor fighting land degradation. An effective and practical auditing system provides standards for \nefficient  use  of  water  and  other  agricultural  resources,  offers  approaches  to  audit  actual \nconditions, and identifies best practices options to meet the standards and minimize adverse \nimpacts on land. This type of auditing system is almost completely missing in Kazakhstan. Such a \nsystem is essential to develop ideas and build knowledge for agricultural agencies and farmers to \napply best practices that can reduce production costs while gaining environmental benefits.  \n \n8.  The  important  link  between  improved  natural  resources  management  and  poverty \nreduction is recognized both in ADB\u2019s country strategy for Kazakhstan and regional strategy for \nCentral Asian countries. Kazakhstan accords high priority in improving land management and ", "3 \nparticipated in one advisory TA and ten regional TAs. Lessons from most relevant TAs3 include (i) \ncapacity building focusing only on the central Government tends to be too theoretical and not \ndirectly related to the specific needs of the institutions, and (ii) sustained capability to better \nmanage the environment is best carried out by involving agencies other than environmental \nagencies at both national and local levels. The recently launched ADB program for Central Asian \nCountries Initiatives on Land Management (CACILM) emphasizes the mainstreaming of land \nmanagement considerations into overall sustainable development policies and programs, and \ncovers a range of interactive interventions from policy and legislation development, institutional \nstrengthening to on-the-ground investment projects. This TA is in line with the CACILM and is \ndesigned to help the Government to develop a cost-effective and cross-sectoral monitoring and \ninformation management system to support policy development, program or project preparation, \nand establishment of environmental safeguard mechanisms for sustainable land use. A pilot \nunder the TA to be implemented in the South Kazakhstan Oblast not only will have a positive \nimpact on the oblast, but could also be replicated nationally and in other Central Asian countries. \n \n9.  Relevant assistance provided by other international aid agencies in Kazakhstan include \nBasic  Geographic  Data  on  Land  Use,  Registration  and  Cadastres  (Japan  International \nCooperation Agency); Hydrometeorological Services for the Aral Sea Basin Program (Swiss \nGovernment);  and  A  Website  on  the  National  State  of  the  Environment  (United  Nations \nEnvironment Programme and the Government of Norway). Most of these projects emphasize \ninformation management at the national level or in the Aral Sea Basin. An ongoing dryland \nmanagement  project  supported  by  the  World  Bank/Global  Environment  Facility  aims  to \ndemonstrate  sustainable  land  uses  in  the  marginal  dryland  ecosystem  in  Sheksky  rayon  of \nKaraganda oblast. This TA will complement the efforts of other aid agencies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The TA aims to enhance institutional capacity in environmental auditing, monitoring, and \ninformation  management  system  to  support  policy  development,  program  preparation,  and \nenvironmental safeguards for sustainable land uses. The TA will have the following outputs: (i) \nmethodologies and operational guidelines to improve environmental auditing, monitoring, and \ninformation  management  system  for  sustainable  use  of  agricultural  land;  (ii)  a  pilot \nimplementation  of  the  system  in  response  to  actual  needs  of  policy  development,  program \npreparation, and environmental safeguards for sustainable land use in the South Kazakhstan \nOblast;4 and (iii) a follow-up expansion program to be included in the 2006 pipeline and financed \nby the Government.5  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  An intersectoral and process approach emphasizing participation of not only national and \nlocal  environmental  agencies  but  also  agricultural  and  land  management  agencies  will  be \n                                                 \n3\n ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n4\n The South Kazakhstan Oblast is selected for trial implementation based on the following criteria: (i) an oblast with \nhigh percentage of desertification and land degradation, (ii) high incidence of poverty tied in part to land degradation, \n(iii) oblast government\u2019s willingness to participate, (iv) data availability, and (v) complement of other ADB project \nefforts. \n5\n $150,000\u2013$200,000 equivalent will be financed from Ministry of Environmental Protection's budgets under various \nrelated projects.  ", "4 \nadopted. A steering committee comprising key staff from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Land \nResources Management Agency, the Working Group of UNCCD, and MOEP will be established. \nTo transfer experience and knowledge from international consultants to Government staff, staff of \nMOEP (the Executing Agency) and local concerned agencies will be involved not only in on-the-\njob training, but also in all key activities such as document review, problem analysis, draft of \nmethodologies and guidelines, pilot project design, and development of the follow-up program \nproposal.  \n \n12.  The TA will support the following interrelated activities: (i) identify the national and local \nneeds  of  environmental  auditing,  monitoring,  and  information  management  systems  for  the \npurpose  of  policy  development,  program  preparation,  and  environmental  safeguards  for \nsustainable land use; (ii) reviewing the existing monitoring and information programs handled by \nvarious agencies, and identify the gaps in meeting the national and local needs; (iii) designing \ncost-effective methodologies and operational guidelines for improving the existing systems; (iv) \ndeveloping a pilot system for environmental auditing, monitoring, and information management in \nthe South Kazakhstan Oblast; (v) recommending to oblast decision makers policy innovations, \ninvestment project concepts, and environmental safeguard mechanisms for sustainable land use \nbased on information assessment; and (vi) preparing a follow-up project to be financed by the \nGovernment to expand the TA outcomes in 2006.  \n \n13.  As milestones, four interagency workshops will be held to discuss TA implementation \ndesign, solicit comments on TA findings, and reach consensus among key stakeholders.6 As key \nmembers of the steering committee, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Land Resources Management \nAgency, the Working Group of UNCCD, and MOEP will each be responsible for organizing one \nworkshop. Consultants will conduct a series of on-the-job training seminars for national and local \ngovernment  staff  during  TA  implementation.  National  and  local  nongoverment  organizations \n(NGOs) will be involved in TA design and implementation. In addition to NGOs\u2019 participation in \nworkshops  and  pilot  project  implementation,  sections  on  NGOs'  roles  as  monitoring  and \ninformation network facilitators and in policy development will be defined as part of the overall \nmethodology and guidelines.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $860,000  equivalent,  comprising  $377,000  of  foreign \nexchange  and  $483,000  equivalent  of  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance  $600,000  equivalent \ncomprising the entire foreign exchange cost and $223,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will \nfinance  the  remainder  of  the  local  currency  cost  of  $260,000  equivalent  ($60,000  parallel \nfinancing  from  MOEP's  budget  under  its  2004\u20132006  Ecological  Cadastre  Project  and \nEnvironmental  Information  Project,  and  $200,000  in  kind).  Cost  estimates  are  presented  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  MOEP will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A steering committee will be established, \nchaired  by  a  vice  minister  of  MOEP  and  comprising  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, the Land Resources Management Agency, and the Working Group of UNCCD. The \n                                                 \n6\n The first workshop will discuss the outlines of the methodologies and guidelines. The second will discuss the drafted \nmethodologies and guidelines and the trial implementation arrangement. The third will assess outcomes of trial \nimplementation, and discuss the revised  methodologies and  guidelines responding to the results of the trial \nimplementation. The last workshop will discuss the draft proposal of the follow-up program and overall TA findings. ", "5 \ncommittee will provide overall guidance in the TA\u2019s direction. The committee members will meet \n2\u20133 times during TA implementation. A TA management unit (TAMU) will be established in \nMOEP to carry out the day-to-day operations of the TA. One senior, qualified official from MOEP \nwill serve as the head of the TAMU and function as the overall TA coordinator. A junior staff will \nserve as administrative assistant. The TAMU will comprise five additional technical experts, one \neach  from  the  Working  Group  of  UNCCD,  Hydrometeorology  Center,  and  Information  and \nAnalysis Center of MOEP, and two from the South Kazakhstan Oblast.  \n \n16.  A  team  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  recruited.  The  international \nconsultants will be recruited from a firm using the quality- and cost-based selection method in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The domestic consultants will be \nselected  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Implementation  will  require  12 \nperson-months  of  international  and  40  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  The \ninternational consultants will have solid experience in (i) land management (5 person-months); (ii) \nenvironmental auditing and monitoring (land-related, 3 person-months); and (iii) environmental \ninformation  management  system  (4  person-months).  The  required  expertise  for  domestic \nconsultants follows: (i) agricultural economics and rural development; (ii) geographic information \nsystem; (iii) information technology (hardware, software, and web design); (iv) land use planning \nand land cadastre; (v) soil science; (vi) water resources management; (vii) legal and institutional \naspects of environmental and land use planning; and (viii) rural sociology. One international \nconsultant will serve as team leader and one domestic consultant will serve as deputy team \nleader. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix 3. A simplified \ntechnical proposal will be used. Completion of the TA will take 14 months from February 2005 to \nApril 2006. Equipment for the TA will be procured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. \n \n17.  The Government and ADB have agreed to include this TA among selected projects under \nthe  Pilot  Study  for  Delegation  of  Consultant  Recruitment  and  Supervision  under  the  TA  to \nExecuting Agencies (Pilot Study)7 approved by ADB. In particular, the Government agreed to \nfollow the implementation procedures outlined in the Pilot Study Board Paper and such other \ndetailed procedures and practices as ADB may require from time to time. The Government has \nacknowledged that the terms and conditions of the Technical Assistance Framework Agreement \n(TAFA) between the Government and ADB dated 5 October 1995 apply to this TA. For the \npurpose of Section 3.01 of the TAFA, ADB has agreed to delegate consultant selection and \nsupervision of firms (or, if applicable, individuals) under this TA to the Government. The letter \nagreement to be issued under the TAFA for this TA will accordingly reflect this arrangement. As \nprovided in the TAFA, consultants engaged and supervised by the Government under this TA will, \namong others, have the status of experts performing missions for ADB and will be entitled to the \nprivileges and exemptions conferred upon such experts under the Agreement Establishing the \nAsian Development Bank.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Kazakhstan for Environmental Monitoring and Information Management System \nfor Sustainable Land Use, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n7\n ADB. 2003.

International Consultants \n \n2.  The  three  international  consultants  will  work  together.  A  flexible  approach  will  be \nadopted to allow each consultant to provide his/her services at most opportune times during TA \nimplementation. The consultants will perform the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Introduce  international  experience  in  monitoring  and  information  management \nsystem to prevent and control land degradation/desertification and best practices that \nmay be applicable to Kazakhstan. \n(ii)  Together with the domestic consultants, identify the national and local needs of \nenvironmental auditing, monitoring and information management systems for the \npurpose of policy development, program preparation, and environmental safeguard \nfor sustainable land use. \n(iii)  Review and assess the main existing monitoring and information programs handled \nby various agencies, and identify the gaps in meeting the national and local needs. \n(iv)  Design and develop methodologies and operational guidelines for improving the \nexisting systems, covering (a) clearly defined users; (b) indicators needed for policy \ndevelopment, program preparation, and environmental safeguards; (c) methodology \nfor monitoring and database development and management; (d) mechanism and \nprocedure of  information  sharing and  exchanges  among  key  agencies;  (e)  data \ncompatibility, comparability, accessibility, and reliability; (f) data analysis methods to \nmeet  the  major  needs  of  policy  development,  program  preparation,  and \nenvironmental safeguards; and (g) mechanisms and procedures to facilitate decision \nmaking with the information management system. \n(v)  Develop a pilot-based monitoring and information management system in the South \nKazakhstan Oblast in response to the oblast\u2019s actual needs for policy development, \nprogram preparation or environmental safeguards, possibly covering (a) an inventory \nof  its  significant  characteristics  reflecting  land  use  and  land  quality  (landforms, \nvegetation, water resources status, biodiversity status, soil nutrient status, agriculture \nsystems,  and  current  practices  in  the  use  of  land  resource);  (b)  database  and \nstatistic  mapping  reflecting  other  key  socioeconomic,  legal,  institutional,  and \ntechnical  indicators;  (c)  assessment  of  varied  policies  and  investment  programs \nrelated  to  poverty  reduction;  desertification  control;  development  plans  on \nagriculture,  forestry,  water  resource  and  land  use,  rangeland  and  livestock \nmanagement; and (d) environmental monitoring practices.  ", "10  Appendix 3 \n(vi)  Recommend to decision makers of the South Kazakhstan Oblast practices on policy \nimprovement,  program  preparation,  and  establishment  of  an  environmental \nsafeguard  system  for  sustainable  land  use,  based  on  an  assessment  of  the \neffectiveness of land management policies and investment programs. \n(vii)  Revise and finalize the methodologies and guidelines based on the findings of pilot \nimplementation. \n(viii)  Prepare a follow-up project to be financed by the Government to expand the TA \noutcomes in 2006. Instead of simply disseminating methodologies for environmental \nmonitoring  and  database  establishment,  emphasize  in  the  follow-up  project  the \nimpacts of the information management system on downstream policy improvement \nand institutional changes. \n \n2.  Domestic Consultants \n \n3.  The domestic consultants will play a technical role rather than mainly translators or \ninterpreters in TA implementation. They will perform the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Through document reviews, surveys, and interviews with national and local key \nstakeholders; collect and analyze data and information that will identify the gaps \nin the existing environmental auditing, monitoring, and information systems, and \nnational and local needs; and organize this information in a form facilitating \nreview and analysis by the international consultants. \n(ii)  Help the international consultants understand the Government\u2019s perception of \nexisting opportunities to learn from international experiences. \n(iii)  Help  the  international  consultants  carry  out  the  pilot-based  monitoring  and \ninformation management system, that is, collect data for selected indicators, \ndevelop the database and mapping, compile a data dictionary, prepare the user\u2019s \nmanual, design appropriate map templates, design and develop a web site in \nconsultation with the oblast users. \n(iv)  Help the international consultants design and organize the training program, and \nprovide appropriate services as resource persons. \n(v)  Together with the international consultants, help the Ministry of Environmental \nProtection (MOEP), the Executing Agency, draft all the documents specified as \nTA outputs. \n(vi)  Perform other activities relating to the TA central objectives as assigned by the \nteam leader. \n \nB.
