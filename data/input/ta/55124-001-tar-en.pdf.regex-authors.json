INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance  (TA) will  support the countries of \nSoutheast Asia (SEA) in transitioning to a cleaner energy future. While this transition is already \nunderway in some countries, the pace of transformation needs to be accelerated across the SEA \nregion to avert a development path inconsistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. This \ntransition needs to be just and inclusive,1 ensuring affordable, reliable, and equitable access to \nenergy services. The proposed TA will assist SEA countries with a comprehensive package of \nsolutions including (i) the preparation of sectoral and country-specific assessments; (ii) the \ndevelopment of new business models, feasibility reports, and other technical studies; (iii) the \nconduct of workshops and policy dialogues; and (iv) the development of project investment \npipelines to be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners. \n \n2.  The TA is well aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and will support several of its operational \npriorities.2 By helping SEA countries develop clean energy solutions in an affordable manner, the \nTA will help widen access to energy services, thereby reducing inequalities, including gender-\nbased ones. A transition to cleaner forms of energy will also support SEA countries in tackling \nclimate  change by  reducing their greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions. In addition, activities \nimplemented under the TA will enhance energy sector governance and transparency, foster \nopportunities for power system integration within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN), and support knowledge transfer among developing countries. Overall, the TA will \nstrongly support Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 (poverty alleviation), SDG5 (gender \nequality and women\u2019s empowerment), SDG7 (affordable and cleaner energy), SDG13 (climate \naction), and SDG16 (stronger institutions). The TA is included in the 2021 work plan for ADB\u2019s \nSoutheast Asia Department.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Clean energy progress in Southeast Asia. Energy demand in the SEA region has been \ngrowing rapidly, driven by robust economic growth, demographic expansion, and increased \nurbanization. While the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has slowed down \nenergy demand growth, a rebound is expected in 2023\u20132025.4 Traditionally, the SEA region has \nbeen reliant on fossil fuels, with coal consumption more than doubling since 2010.5 The rapidly \nincreasing energy demand is also a challenge to the long-term ambition of keeping regional GHG \nemissions on a trajectory consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. To address these \nchallenges, it is necessary to accelerate the transition to cleaner forms of energy, which is a move \ntoward lower carbon, less polluting, and less  environmentally impactful models for energy \ngeneration, distribution, and utilization. This transition will be well aligned with the green recovery \nprograms implemented by governments in an effort to rebound from the COVID-19 crisis, as the \ndevelopment of clean energy infrastructure has been shown to result in a larger proportion of local \njobs and higher local economic benefits. Women would also be among the main beneficiaries of \na just and equitable transition to a clean energy future.6 \n \n1  ADB has also made a commitment to just transition in its High Level MDB Statement.

In 2019, \nfor the first time, more renewable energy projects than coal projects reached final investment \ndecision in the SEA region.7 More recently, the deployment of new renewable capacity has \naccelerated in  some countries at  an  unprecedented scale.  In Viet  Nam,  utility-scale grid-\nconnected solar photovoltaic capacity increased from only 260 megawatts in April 2019 to 5,053 \nmegawatts in July 2020.8 Similarly, Cambodia launched its first open reverse auction for new solar \nphotovoltaic capacity in 2019. The SEA region is also quickly embracing new technologies, \nincluding offshore wind power (Viet Nam), floating solar (Indonesia), and utility-scale battery \nstorage (Thailand). \n \n5.  Some countries in the SEA region have also indicated preliminary measures to scale back \ntheir coal generation expansion plans, cancel new coal-fired power projects in the development \npipeline, or retire old plants. Viet Nam is revising its power development plan to accommodate \nmore renewable capacity in lieu of coal. In October 2020, the Philippines announced a moratorium \non new coal power plants.9 The deployment of new technologies, with attendant disruptions, has \nalso manifested in new business models, new entrants, and efforts by already established players \nto re-invent themselves. In the near term, decentralized renewable energy systems in combination \nwith storage may offer cost-effective solutions to serving remote areas and small islands across \nthe SEA region. \n \n6.  Challenges to the cleaner energy transition. Notwithstanding these encouraging signs, \nmore needs to be done to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy in the SEA region. Several \npersistent challenges must  be  addressed  and  at  scale,  including policy,  regulatory, and \ninstitutional capacity constraints. In some countries, development is hampered by below-cost \ntariffs, while  in others further progress is  stalled  because of the perceived threat of new \ntechnologies to the  traditional  business models of power utilities and  the high risks  and \nuncertainties associated with certain emerging technologies. Another challenge is that power \nsystems in the SEA region have been developed based on a traditional centralized model, with \nlimited regional interconnection of power grids, leaving them unable to accommodate variable \nrenewable energy (VRE) at a large scale. \n \n7.  Energy efficiency remains largely untapped in the SEA region (footnote 7). Progress has \nbeen hampered by a lack of energy efficiency policies and regulations, and energy performance \nstandards seldom  follow global  best practices. Further progress is  hindered by a  lack  of \nawareness and generally low levels of local expertise in energy efficiency, which are reflected in \nthe slow adoption of \u201cenergy as a service\u201d business models. The reluctance of national banks to \nfinance energy efficiency projects is another constraint. SEA countries could also benefit from \nfurther cooperation at  the  regional level,  such  as  the harmonization  of  minimum  energy \nperformance standards. \n \n8.  The power generation mix of most SEA countries is dominated by fossil fuels, namely, \ncoal and natural gas. Despite the scaling back of project development pipelines, coal-fired power \ngeneration still features prominently in the power development plans of some SEA countries. \nAccording to its latest power development plan, Viet Nam is planning 17 gigawatts of new coal \ncapacity by 2030, and in 2019, Cambodia signed agreements to import up to 2.4 gigawatts of \ncoal-generated power from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.10 Existing and planned coal-\n \n7  IEA. 2019.

Phnom Penh. \n ", "3 \nfired power projects have an adverse impact on the environment and health of populations, and \nare major contributors to GHG emissions.11 At the same time, however, coal-fired generation is \ngenerally perceived as a well-proven, reliable, and affordable technology. In addition, coal is \nwidely available,  and the industry is a significant contributor to the economy in some SEA \ncountries.12 Therefore, the phasing out of coal needs to consider broader socioeconomic impacts \nwithin the context of a just transition in impacted countries. \n \n9.  For more than 2 decades, SEA countries have been exploring opportunities for enhancing \nregional power interconnections and power trading through various platforms, including the \nASEAN  Power  Grid initiative  and  the  Greater Mekong Subregion Regional  Power Trade \nCoordination Committee (GMS-RPTCC). Notwithstanding these efforts, regional power trade still \naccounts for a marginal proportion of the total power consumed in SEA. Therefore, the multiple \nbenefits of the regional power trade and cooperation could be further leveraged.13 \n \n10.  The long-term aim of reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century, consistent with the \nParis Agreement goals, requires a profound transformation in how energy is produced and used. \nThe power sector has been at the forefront of this transformation,14 benefiting from the significant \ndrop in renewable energy costs, particularly wind and solar. Transport and heavy industry sectors, \nwhere fossil fuels are more difficult to replace as cost-effectively, will take longer to decarbonize. \nIn these sectors, the clean energy transition will first hinge on the increased electrification of \ntransport,15 and on the use of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen produced from renewable \nelectricity (green hydrogen) in industrial processes, in the medium to long term.16 Thus, a cleaner \npower sector will be a key enabler of this transition to clean energy. \n \n11.  Finally, crosscutting the issues outlined in paras. 6\u201310, the development of cost-effective \nenergy infrastructure in  several  SEA  countries has  been  hindered by  inadequate  sector \ngovernance and transparency. This is reflected in the limited public disclosure of the terms and \nconditions of power purchase agreements, owing to the region\u2019s preference for negotiated \nbilateral  agreements rather than  reverse auctions. This has led to information asymmetry, \nconflicts of interest, high transaction costs, noncompetitive pricing, and often poor-quality services. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s role and value addition. ADB has been a key development partner supporting \nSEA countries in the transition to a cleaner energy future through a combination of TA, policy \ndialogue, transaction advisory services, and financing of first-mover projects and investments. \nFor example, ADB has been financing the private sector across the SEA region to invest in the \nfirst set of renewables and  renewables-plus-storage projects, electric vehicles, and battery \ncharging infrastructure. In the public sector, ADB provided transaction advisory support for the \nfirst utility-scale reverse auction in Cambodia, which led to the lowest power purchase tariff for a \nsolar project in SEA, and has spurred similar efforts across the SEA region. ADB has been also \na key proponent of the regional power trade and interconnections through its support of technical \nstudies and policy dialogue, and financing for certain keystone projects under the auspices of the \n \n11 In 2018, an estimated 450,000 deaths in SEA were attributed to air pollution.

While ADB has supported improved governance in the sector as well as energy \nefficiency investments, these are two areas where more needs to be done.17 \n \n13.  ADB is well-positioned to continue driving the clean energy transition in the SEA region, \nand this dovetails effectively with its ongoing effort to support its developing member countries in \ndesigning and delivering green recovery programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The \nTA will build on the outcomes of ADB\u2019s TA for Integrated Resource Planning with Strategic \nEnvironmental Assessment for Sustainable Power Sector Development in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion, 18  and  other  country-specific activities  that  have  been  piloting  clean  energy \ntechnologies and business models. Further, it will complement efforts organized under ADB\u2019s \nASEAN Scaling UP Renewables + Storage (ASSURE) initiative.19 Opportunities for synergies \nunder a single ADB umbrella will be proactively explored, especially with the ASEAN Catalytic \nGreen Finance Facility, ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership, a regional knowledge and \nsupport TA on developing next generation renewable energy opportunities by the private sector \nin SEA,20 as well as energy sector interventions proposed by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations \nDepartment. The TA will also draw on lessons from other regional departments of ADB and sector \nthematic groups. In addition, collaboration and coordination on the clean energy transition will be \nsought with other development partners. In particular, the TA will engage closely with other \nmultilateral development institutions and commercial banks with a view to leverage additional \nresources and harmonizing co-financing. Lastly, given the importance of improving access to \nknowledge and information to increase the capacities of developing member countries on clean \nenergy, a plan will be prepared to disseminate all knowledge products completed under the TA to \na wider audience. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: transition to cleaner forms of energy in SEA \nachieved.21 The TA will  have  the following outcome: enabling conditions for clean energy \ntransition created and enhanced.22 Activities under the TA will support catalyzing public and \nprivate sector capital for clean energy investments in the region, which could increase by 100% \nby 2024 relative to 2019. The TA will also facilitate a just transition and contribute to women\u2019s \nempowerment and gender equality by fostering opportunities to create jobs for women and by \nsupporting gender-sensitive and socially inclusive energy sector policies. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n15.  Output 1: Coal and other fossil fuel-based generation assets phased-out. The TA will \nsupport (i) the design of a funding mechanism to support the early retirement of coal and other \n \n17 ADB. 2020.

This work will build on the results and recommendations of an ADB-\nfunded prefeasibility study on the viability of setting up a carbon-reduction facility.24 Activities will \ninclude the development of country-specific plans for coal asset retirement with comprehensive \nanalysis of the associated economic and social benefits, establishment of the funding mechanism, \nand preparation of the implementation rules and procedures of the fund or facility.25 \n \n16.  Output 2: Renewable energy solutions scaled-up. The TA will enhance opportunities \nfor public- and private-sector investments in new renewable energy capacity. The TA will support \nSEA countries to overcome barriers to the uptake of renewable energies, including (i) VRE (solar \nand wind); (ii) waste-to-energy; (iii) flexible generation dispatch technologies (e.g., battery storage \nand hydropower); (iv) emerging technologies and services (e.g., offshore wind power, floating \nsolar, and electrical mobility); and (v) markets for innovative ancillary services.26 The TA will \nassess  opportunities to integrate these technologies and  services across  multiple sectors, \nespecially in urban settings, and to raise capital through green financing options. To this end, the \nTA will support the preparation of technical and sectoral studies,27 the design and conduct of \nlarge-scale reverse auctions, and de-risking and mobilization of private sector capital for these \ninvestments, including through the use of green and climate finance. \n \n17.  Output 3: Energy efficiency solutions expanded. The TA resources will help improve \nenergy efficiency in buildings, appliances, and the industrial sector. It will draw  on ADB\u2019s \nexperiences from Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. In Cambodia, ADB is currently \nsupporting the development of key enabling policies and the scoping of a public investment \nprogram, while in Indonesia ADB is assessing the market for energy service companies. In \nThailand and Viet Nam, ADB is working with national power utilities in the development of \u201cenergy \nas a service\u201d business models.28 The TA will support the drafting and enactment of policies, \nregulations,  and  standards  on  energy efficiency; the  design  and  organization  of  public \nprocurement programs for more efficient appliances; and the development of new projects and \nbusiness opportunities centered on \u201cenergy as a service\u201d for the digital economy. \n \n18.  Output 4: Energy sector governance and transparency enhanced. Increasing shares \nof VRE, decentralized power generation, and technological innovation present new challenges to \nthe energy sector public institutions in the SEA region. Enhancing energy sector governance and \ntransparency will allow them to manage these challenges more efficiently. A priority area is the \nneed to  increase  disclosure of electricity contracts, especially  of  fossil fuel-based power \ngeneration assets. The TA will build on the outcomes of an ongoing ADB-funded study assessing \nthe benefits of power purchase agreement disclosure by working with selected SEA countries in \nadopting best practices. The TA will also support additional sector reforms in coordination with \nother ongoing TA activities in the SEA region.29 \n \n23  The mechanism proposed under this TA will focus on one component of phasing-out coal and other fossil-fuel based \ngeneration assets: legacy coal-fired power plants. Plants that have been recently announced or that are in the \ndevelopment pipeline shall be addressed through other approaches, which could include moratoriums on future \nexpansion. \n24 This prefeasibility study is expected to be completed in August 2021. \n25  SEA countries with high shares of electricity generated from coal are the most likely candidates for these activities. \nOutput 1 will also explore opportunities for the retirement of carbon-intensive fuels from the power generation mix, \nnamely, diesel and heavy fuel oil, with just transition considerations. \n26 These include grid stability services, such as voltage control, frequency reserve, and inertial response. \n27 Study topics will include a gender perspective and may focus on women\u2019s participation in renewables. \n28  Business models whereby a service provider offers various energy-related services rather than only supplying \nelectricity. These could include energy advisory, asset installation, and financing and energy management solutions. \n29 Engagement with civil society organizations will be considered when implementing activities under this output. \n ", "6 \n19.  Output 5: Regional power grid integration enhanced. The TA will support two major \nactivities under this output. First, it will enable ADB to continue serving as the secretariat of the \nGMS-RPTCC and build a stronger link with similar activities undertaken at the ASEAN level under \nthe ASEAN Power Grid initiative. In this role, ADB will continue supporting discussions on power \ntrade, facilitate the establishment of multilateral agreements, and support the preparation of \ntechnical studies and pilot projects.30 Second, the TA will leverage these platforms to fully realize \nopportunities for regional cooperation related to outputs 1\u20134. In particular, the TA will explore \nopportunities for the harmonization of minimum energy performance standards among countries \nand the accreditation of technicians and facilities for equipment testing. Activities under this output \nwill build on the recommendations of a review conducted by ADB during the second quarter of \n2021 on lessons over its 20-year experience in support of the regional power trade in countries \nin the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $4.05 million, of which (i) $2.25 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Fund (TASF 7: $0.25 million, TASF-other sources: \n$2.00 million); (ii) $1.0 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Clean Energy Fund31 under \nthe Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB, (iii) $0.5 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Strategic Climate Fund and administered by ADB, and (iv) $0.3 \nmillion  will  be financed on a  grant basis  by the Spanish  Cooperation Fund for Technical \nAssistance and administered by ADB.32 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department through its Energy Division \n(SEEN) will implement the TA in collaboration with the GMS-RPTCC and energy ministries of \nSEA countries to identify specific needs and priority issues aligned with the scope of the TA. \nSEEN  will also coordinate closely with ADB resident missions in SEA  countries and other \ndevelopment partners. The TA will be implemented over a period of 36 months, from June 2021 \nto June 2024. \n \n22.
