INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help government agencies, \nthrough knowledge development and capacity building, to plan Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery from the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and make systems resilient to similar crises in the future. The \nTA will focus on key sectors and address gaps in the system to ensure improved service delivery \nin the medium and long term. \n   \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) policy paper, Comprehensive \nResponse to the COVID-19 Pandemic.1 The policy paper articulates ADB\u2019s support for its \ndeveloping member countries in mitigating the economic, social, and health impacts of the \npandemic.2 It is in response to the government\u2019s request for TA to conduct assessments on \nsectors affected by COVID-19 for national development planning for recovery from COVID-19 \nand building resilience. The TA will support the government\u2019s approach of maximizing the use of \nexisting government human resources. Where capacity is not available, the TA will be used to \nmobilize national experts; if national experts are not available, international experts will be \nmobilized. The TA is included in the ADB country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023 for Sri \nLanka.3 The current country partnership strategy envisages the provision of knowledge support \nduring the implementation period in line with government needs.4 The TA is aligned with the \noperational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  While Sri Lanka successfully contained the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, the \nemergence of a new cluster in early October 2020 has put that success at risk. As of 25 November \n2020, Sri Lanka had 20,967 confirmed cases, with 15,447 recoveries and 94 deaths.6 Early \nimplementation of stringent public health and strict lockdown measures helped contain the spread \nof the virus in the first half of 2020. However, disruption caused by COVID-19 and containment \nmeasures  adversely  affected  economic  activity  and  lowered  consumer  and  business \nconfidence\u2014limiting household income and consumption as well as private sector business sales \nand investment. Tourism suffered as arrivals fell by 63.1% year on year in the first 9 months of \n2020.7 The government response focused on support to the poor and vulnerable, including people \nwho had lost income sources, by providing cash transfers and expanding existing social protection \nschemes, but the scale, scope, and duration of cash transfers limited the stimulus to the economy. \nThe government placed greater emphasis on monetary policy measures and finance sector \nmeasures to support the economic response. It supported industries by providing subsidized \nloans and debt moratoriums.  \n \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 November 2020. \n2  ADB. 2020.

ADB projects the economy to shrink by 5.5% in 2020.8 As with most crises, the poor and \nvulnerable  sections  of  the  population,  including  women,  feel  the  largest  impact  of  these \ndevelopments. The poverty headcount ratio at the poverty line of $5.5 a day (in 2011 purchasing \npower parity) is expected to increase from 38.4% in 2018 to 41.3% in 2020.9  \n \n5.  The fundamental development problem the government faces is recovering from the \npandemic and making systems resilient to face future crises of a similar scale. While this will \ninclude policy responses to stimulate the economy and support sectors that continue to struggle, \nthe government needs to identify gaps in the system and enhance the skills and knowledge of \ngovernment officials to develop and implement plans and programs. Before the outbreak of \nCOVID-19, the government had identified key policy areas in the National Policy Framework to \nguide the country\u2019s development process.10 These priorities remain relevant and continue to guide \nthe government\u2019s recovery efforts. The policy areas prioritized by the National Policy Framework \ninclude (i) human resources development through better health care and education, (ii) agriculture \nand food security, (iii) improving the business climate, (iv) increasing exports, (v) tackling the \nbudget deficit, (vi) value addition by small and medium-sized enterprises, (vii) women\u2019s labor force \nparticipation, (viii) improving social protection and welfare, (ix) an integrated planning and spatial \napproach to address rural\u2013urban gaps, (x) ensuring water for all for drinking and agriculture, (xi) \nstrengthening disaster management and disaster warning systems, (xii) ensuring data availability \nfor informed decision-making, and (xiii) mitigating the human\u2013elephant conflict.11 A crucial aspect \nof the post-COVID-19 recovery will be the access to and deployment of vaccines through a well-\ncrafted vaccination strategy. \n \n6.  The government has requested ADB assistance to support its efforts toward economic \nrecovery and improving system resilience. ADB needs to respond with curated knowledge \nsolutions  in  a  time-bound  manner  and  provide  support  to  the  government  to  respond  to \ndevelopment issues successfully. The TA will support the government\u2019s planning and policy \nformulation with analytical studies, policy briefs, and technical reports on sector and thematic \nissues in priority areas; undertaking surveys and data analysis; and capacity development of \npublic officials.    \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) \naccelerating progress in gender equality (by making women more resilient to external shocks and \npromoting women\u2019s economic empowerment); and (ii) strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity (through enhanced capacity and improved service delivery) (footnote 5). The TA will also \ncontribute to the operational priority on addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities. \nThe TA will contribute toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals through capacity \nbuilding and knowledge support in areas that support women\u2019s empowerment and sustained and \ninclusive economic growth.  \n \n8.  ADB has provided knowledge and capacity development TA to Sri Lanka through similar \nTA projects in the past. The TA for Support for Planning and Policy Formulation (Phase 1) had a \nwide scope to build government capacity in policy making, through knowledge products and \n \n8  Central Bank of Sri Lanka project the economy to contract by 1.7% in 2020.

In response, people resort to actions that have resulted \nin elephant deaths.  \n ", "3 \ntraining.12 It was rated successful, and the TA completion report highlights the flexibility in the \ndesign that allowed the accommodation of a wide range of policy-related activities and quick \nresponses to government requests.13 The TA for the Umbrella Technical Assistance Capacity \nDevelopment Fund also had a broad scope, but was rated unsuccessful.14 The TA completion \nreport noted that the implementation was affected by lack of output selection criteria, which were \nleft to be determined during implementation, and lack of government ownership. Considering \nthese lessons, the TA retains a flexible approach while ensuring government commitment through \nclose  coordination  with  the  National  Planning  Department  (NPD)  during  the  design  and \nimplementation. The ongoing TA for Supporting Delivery of Strategic Knowledge Solutions also \nprovides capacity building and knowledge products, and has progressed satisfactorily.15 The TA \nwill complement the work under the regional TA for Planning for Economic Recovery of South \nAsia from COVID-19, which will support the knowledge development and exchange for economic \nrecovery plans and adjust development strategies.16  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: knowledge base and capacity of government \nagencies to respond to shocks and fast-track recovery enhanced (defined by TA). The TA will \nhave the following outcome: capacity of government to support the preparation of policies and \nprograms on systems strengthening and resilience enhanced.17 The outcome will be achieved \nthrough support for the training of government officials and the development of knowledge \nproducts. The achievement of the outcome will be measured through the contribution of these \nknowledge products and training programs to policy making. The first outcome indicator will \nassess if at least five of the recommendations from knowledge products are submitted for \nconsideration by relevant government agencies for economic and social policy making by the end \nof 2023. The second indicator will assess if at least two analytical tools and methodologies that \nthe government officials are trained on are applied in developing policies and programs by the \nend of 2023. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Technical studies, policy briefs, and other knowledge products on key \nsector and thematic issues prepared. The TA will identify and analyze critical issues that need \nto be addressed to achieve high growth and strengthen the country\u2019s economic fundamentals \naccording to priorities agreed on by the NPD and ADB. The assessments will focus on key sectors \n \n12 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Support for Planning and \nPolicy Formulation, Phase 1.

The TA will support the production of printed copies, apart from the digital publications, to \ndisseminate to relevant government agencies. About 50 copies of each publication will be printed \nto provide copies to all relevant government agencies, but the number may vary according to the \ndissemination plan as discussed in paragraph 13.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Government officials\u2019 knowledge and skills on systems strengthening \nand resilience improved. Based on requests made by the government, capacity building \nprograms (including conferences, workshops, roundtable discussions, and knowledge sessions) \nwill be conducted by resource persons to strengthen the capacity of government officials. Training \nprograms will develop skills and provide analytical tools to enhance the capacity of government \nofficials to support policy analysis and program development to strengthen systems and resilience. \nThe output will be measured by the number of training activities conducted (at least five) and the \neffectiveness of these programs will be assessed from participants\u2019 feedback.   \n \n13.  Output  3:  Findings  of  knowledge  products  widely  disseminated.  Effective \ndissemination is crucial to ensure that the findings and recommendations of the studies are \nincluded  in  the  policy  dialogue,  and  feed  into  the  government\u2019s  policies  and  programs.  A \ncommunication strategy for the dissemination of knowledge products will be decided by ADB in \nconsultation with the government and will depend on the knowledge product. The dissemination \nplan  will  take  into  consideration  the  type  of  product,  target  audience,  and  the  prevailing               \nCOVID-19 environment.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000 of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Ministry of Finance\u2019s NPD will be the executing agency of the TA. ADB will administer \nthe TA through its Sri Lanka Resident Mission. The resident mission will select, supervise, and \nevaluate  the  consultants;  and  undertake  knowledge  products,  organize  workshops  and \nknowledge events, and plan and undertake dissemination. The specific studies and capacity \ndevelopment events will be identified during implementation, in discussion between the NPD and \nADB. While requests could come from line agencies, the activities will be discussed with the NPD \nfor concurrence. ADB will discuss the arrangements for the selection of proposals, such as the \nscreening criteria and process, with the executing agency during implementation.    \n \n16.
