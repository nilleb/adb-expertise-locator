Following an investigation of the Southern Transport Development Project (STDP), the \nCompliance  Review  Panel  (CRP)1  recommended  that  the  Management  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  implement  several  measures  to  bring  the  Project  back  into \ncompliance. Among the measures is \u201chelp establish well-staffed monitoring of resettlement \nactivities by an independent institution, forwarding concerns to Road Development Authority \n(RDA) for urgent action from the affected persons (APs).\u201d Accordingly, ADB agreed with the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka to provide technical assistance (TA) for engaging an independent \ninstitution to review the progress of resettlement activities, monitor ongoing activities, and report \nto RDA on deficiencies, if any, for immediate corrective action.2 Discussions were first held with \nthe Ministry of Highways (MOH) and RDA, and the Fact-Finding Mission was fielded during     \n11-18 November 2005 to finalize the scope, schedule, and the financing plan. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Background. The primary output of the STDP is a 128-kilometer (km) highway from \nColombo to Matara, and a 6 km link (Galle Access Road) from the highway to the city of Galle. \nFinancing for the northern portion of the highway is provided by Japan Bank for International \nCooperation  (JBIC)  and  ADB  is  financing  the  approximately  60  km  southern  section.  The \nProject also includes (i) a consulting services component for construction supervision and a \nblack spot improvement component funded by ADB; (ii) a safety equipment supply component \nfinanced by Nordic Development Fund (NDF); and (iii) consulting services components for \nproject management and traffic safety improvement financed by NDF and Swedish International \nDevelopment Agency (SIDA), respectively. The ADB loan for the Project was approved on 25 \nNovember 1999 and declared effective on 30 October 2002.  \n \n3.  Approximately 1,100 hectares, owned by 10,000 persons, were acquired for the Project. \nThat affected about 3,000 families, about 214 of whom were vulnerable families, and physically \ndisplaced about 1,300 families. About 1,500 structures, comprising 1,315 private residences \nand 151 commercial establishments were removed from the project site. The government\u2019s \nresettlement implementation plan (RIP) was approved by ADB on 22 October 2002, and the civil \nworks contract was awarded on 22 December 2002. The RIP outlines the processes and \nschedule for (i) payment of compensation and other entitlements; (ii) relocation of APs to \nspecially designated sites; (iii) provision of assistance to self-relocated persons; (iv) an income \nrestoration program (IRP); (v) assistance with reestablishment of social networks and social \ncapital; and (vi) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the resettlement process. The construction \nsupervision engineer is implementing the RIP.  \n \n4.  Current Status. By mid-October 2005, approximately 50% of the earthworks in the \nADB-financed section had been completed and, based on the original contract, the overall \nphysical completion level was about 26%. All APs in the ADB section and 87.6% in the JBIC \nsection had been paid statutory compensation equivalent to 100% of payments due. The total \namount of statutory compensation paid up to the end of August 2005 was about $36 million \n(52% of which was paid out in the ADB section, and 48% in the JBIC section). In addition to the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. CRP Request No. 2004/1 on the Southern Transport Development Project in Sri Lanka-ADB Loan No. \n1711-SRI SF: Final Report. June. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 15 January 2005. ", "2   \nstatutory  compensation,  APs  in  over  90%  of  the  acquired  lots  were  eligible  to  receive \nsupplementary  allowances  prescribed  by  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  committees \n(LARCs). At the end of August 2005, 97.1% of those in the ADB section and 85.7% in the JBIC \nsection had received LARC payments, and about 90% of the APs had received interest for the \ndelayed statutory compensation. Total payments, in excess of the statutory compensation, by \nthe end of August 2005 were about $14 million (excluding interest). However, some APs who \nopted for RDA-provided resettlement sites have not yet received (i) titles to properties assigned \nunder  the  resettlement  plan,  and  thus  some  APs  are  prevented  from  using  properties  as \ncollateral to raise mortgages and loans; (ii) adequate compensation for partial loss of property; \nand (iii) interest on delayed compensation payments. At most sites, access roads and basic \namenities are not fully developed.  \n \n5.  Because STDP is the first road project to involve large-scale involuntary resettlement in \nSri Lanka, implementation of the resettlement plan was difficult and slow at the beginning. RDA \nand  related  agencies  lacked  personnel  and  know-how  to  ensure  efficient  and  effective \nimplementation in general, and to respond to the concerns of vulnerable APs such as women, \nchildren, and the elderly in particular. At the outset, RDA engaged an independent external body \nto monitor and report on the progress of the resettlement activities. Due to poor quality of the \nmonitor\u2019s work, however, the RDA proposed, and ADB concurred, to delegate the monitoring \nresponsibility to the project management consultant (MC), FinnRoad. The MC now continually \nmonitors and reports progress to ADB through monthly reports. Issues requiring particular \nattention of the Government or MOH are highlighted through this monitoring process, and \ndiscussed at the monthly project coordination committee (PCC) meetings and management \ngroup meetings. Subsequently, the chair of the PCC, the secretary of MOH, approves corrective \nactions deemed necessary. Periodic external reviews of resettlement activities are conducted by \nan international specialist under then construction supervision engineer\u2019s contract. \n \n6.  While RDA has exerted its best efforts and established a comprehensive compensation \nand allowance payment and a monitoring system, there is still a sense of feeling among some \nAPs  that  RDA\u2019s  responses  to  issues  such  as  delayed  payment  of  compensation  and \nentitlements,  incomplete  infrastructure  at  resettlement  sites  are  slow  or  ineffective.  ADB \nmissions and Sri Lanka Resident Mission (SLRM) staff continue to bring such issues to the \nattention of the Government, and action is being taken by RDA to address them. However, ADB \nand the Government decided that systematic independent monitoring as recommended by the \nCRP  and  formal  reporting  according  to  an  agreed-upon  framework  would  enable  RDA  to \nrespond more effectively and equitably.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcomes \n \n7.  APs\u2019 living standards, in terms of incomes and livelihood, will be raised or at least \nrestored  to  preproject  levels,  and  better  access  to  markets  and  employment  will  increase \nopportunities to derive direct or indirect benefits from the STDP. The TA will facilitate the \nidentification  of  deficiencies  in  the  resettlement  activities,  which  include  payment  of \ncompensation, relocation, rehabilitation, and related activities, and timely implementation of \ncorrective measures, to ensure compliance with CRP recommendations and loan covenants on \nindependent monitoring. \n \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  An experienced domestic nongovernment institution supported by an international M&E \nspecialist  will  use  a  combination  of  periodic  desk  reviews,  personal  interviews,  and  field \nobservations to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of the resettlement activities in relation \nto a set of predetermined indicators and targets or standards agreed upon with ADB and JBIC. \nDuring the first 6 months of the TA, the consultants will design a monitoring framework, using \nsample data from RDA\u2019s databases and independent field visits, and validate the framework; \nidentify types of activities unlikely to meet the agreed-upon targets or standards; develop a \nmechanism for suggesting corrective measures to RDA; and prepare a work plan for periodic \nmonitoring over the next 18 months. The primary aspects to be monitored will include, but will \nnot necessarily be limited to (i) standards of living (including livelihood and income) of APs,     \n(ii) timeliness and completeness of payments to APs of compensation and LARC allowances, \n(iii) physical condition of RDA-established resettlement sites, (iv) socioeconomic conditions of \nself-relocated  persons,  and  (v)  special  or  potential  problems  brought  to  the  consultant\u2019s \nattention by APs and RDA responses. Corrective measures, if needed, will be proposed in line \nwith the RIP and, aimed at increasing its effectiveness and efficiency.  \n \n9.  The domestic consultants will organize workshops to (i) discuss the draft monitoring \nframework and work plan, (ii) verify and finalize the monitoring framework and work plan,        \n(iii) discuss findings from continuous monitoring, and (iv) discuss biannual monitoring activities \nand case studies as well the impact of actions taken by RDA. In consultation with ADB and \nJBIC, the consultants will establish a workshop-panel, which may comprise, but will not be \nlimited to (i) selected APs; (ii) specialists in resettlement, environment, and income restoration; \nand (iii) distinguished members of the community such as legal experts, academicians, etc; to \ncomment on the findings and suggest measures to correct deficiencies in the resettlement \nprocess.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n10.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $421,000  equivalent  including  a  foreign \nexchange component of $76,000 and a local currency component of $345,000 equivalent. The \nTA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will provide up to \n$336,000 equivalent to cover all foreign exchange and local costs. The government will provide \nlocal currency equivalent of $85,000 in the form of data, reports, and visits to the project sites.  \nJBIC  will  provide  $150,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  on  a  parallel  basis  for  external \nmonitoring of resettlement activities in the JBIC-funded section, and will engage ADB\u2019s TA \nconsultants under the same terms of reference (TOR). Details of the costs and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  MOH  will  serve  as  the  Executing  Agency  and  facilitate  unrestricted  access  by  TA \nconsultants to relevant RDA databases, information sources, and project sites. SLRM staff will \nadminister the TA in coordination with JBIC to ensure independence and impartiality, and will be \ndirectly responsible for guiding and advising the TA consultants. SLRM will arrange quarterly \nmeetings with JBIC, MOH, and RDA to discuss the consultants\u2019 findings, and agree on the \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmechanism  and  schedule  for  implementing  corrective  measures,  where  necessary.  The \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nsecretary of MOH will then announce the agreements at the subsequent PCC meeting, and \ninstruct RDA accordingly. Biannual workshops organized by the domestic consultants will be the \nforum for reporting on the status of the corrective measures to the key stakeholders. \n ", "4   \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, 30 March 2006\u201329 March 2008. It will \nrequire 26 person-months of consulting services: 3 for the services of an international M&E \nspecialist, and 23 for the services of a domestic consulting institution. ADB will engage the \nconsultants  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The  international \nconsultant will be engaged on an individual basis. The quality- and cost-based selection method \nwill be employed in selecting the domestic consulting institution on the basis of simplified \ntechnical proposals, to ensure that the institution is fully staffed as requested by the CRP, and \nthe methodology is further elaborated. The domestic consulting institution will comprise a social \ndevelopment specialist with a strong background in resettlement and income generation serving \nas team leader and providing 12 person-months of input; a statistician for 8 person-months; and \nan experienced workshop facilitator/moderator for 3 person-months of input. The domestic \nconsulting institution will be expected to have in-house staff or be able to externally source staff \nexperienced in conducting personal interview surveys, database management, and computer \ndata entry. Outline TOR for the consultants are given in Appendix 3.  \n \n13.  In view of the significance and relationship of the TA to the rapid progress of the STDP, \napproval for advance recruitment action according to Project Administration Instructions Section \n2.02 para. 15 has been granted by the Vice President. The advance action will cover the \nrecruitment of consultants up to, but not including, the signing of the contracts.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n14.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $336,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Sri Lanka for Independent External Monitoring of Resettlement Activities of \nthe Southern Transport Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance   Data  Assumptions and \nTargets and Indicators  Sources/Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact        \nHigher or similar  \u2022  Change in average  RDA\u2019s MIS and office  Assumption \nstandards of living  and standard  records and personal  \u2022  Baseline data, \n(income and assets) of  deviation of income  interviews, and field  including inventory of \nAPs compared with the  of APs   observations  losses, are available \nconditions before the  \u2022  Change in average    or can be \nSTDP  and standard  Final report and final  corroborated or \n  deviation of value of  workshop  reconstructed \nAPs\u2019 fixed asset  through interviews \nvalue   \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncreased effectiveness  \u2022  Average time it takes  RDA\u2019s MIS, personal  \u2022  Corrective action \nof the resettlement  to receive  interviews, and field  istaken by RDA in a \nactivities  compensation and  observations  timely manner \n  other entitlements    \u2022  Baseline data are \n\u2022  Time it takes to  Periodic reports and  available or can be \nreceive land titles  workshops  reconstructed \n\u2022  Completeness of  through interviews \ninfrastructure and   \nservices at new   \nresettlement sites  Risk \n\u2022  Percent of APs  \u2022  APs are unwilling to \nreceiving income  share personal \nrestoration program  information and \nfunds  agree on the findings \n\u2022  Number of  of the domestic \ncomplaints received  consultants  \nfrom APs   \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Scope of Services \n \n1.  The Technical Assistance (TA) will require 26 person-months of consulting services: 3 \nfrom  an  international  M&E  specialist,  and  23  from  an  experienced  domestic  consulting \ninstitution. The domestic consulting institution (person-months are in parentheses) will comprise \na social development specialist with a strong background in income generation, serving as team \nleader, (12); a statistician/economist (8); and an experienced workshop facilitator/moderator (3). \nThe domestic consulting institution will also carry out through its staff or appropriate outsourcing \narrangements the necessary fieldwork and data analysis and will organize and conduct the \nrequired workshops. The international consultant will be engaged on an individual basis, and the \ndomestic consulting institution will be engaged by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) using the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  on  the  basis  of  simplified  technical  proposals \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The domestic institution will be \nexpected to have in-house staff experienced in conducting personal interview surveys, database \nmanagement, and computer data entry.  \n \n2.  The consultants will use a combination of periodic desk reviews, personal interviews, \nand field observations to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of the resettlement activities in \nrelation to a set of pre-determined indicators and targets or standards agreed upon with ADB \nand Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).  \n \nB.   Terms of Reference \n \n3.  The TA will be implemented in four phases: phase 1, planning and validation (2 months); \nphase 2, testing and verification (1 month); phase 3, continuous monitoring (3 months); and \nphase 4, periodic monitoring (18 months), over the entire length of about 128 kilometers of the \nSouthern  Transport  Development  Project  (STDP)  and  related  facilities  and  sites.  The \nconsultants should endeavor to monitor all activities related to the resettlement implementation \nplan (RIP) approved by ADB on 22 October 2002.  \n \n4.  During the first 6 months of the TA, the consultants will design a monitoring framework, \nusing sample data from the Road Development Authority\u2019s (RDA) databases and independent \nfield visits and validate the framework, identify types of activities unlikely to meet the agreed-\nupon targets or standards, develop a mechanism for suggesting corrective measures to RDA, \nand prepare a work plan for periodic monitoring over the next 18 months. The primary aspects \nto be monitored will include, but will not necessarily be limited to (i) standards of living (including \nassets and income) of affected persons (APs), (ii) timeliness and completeness of payment of \ncompensation  and  other  allowances  to  APs,  (iii)  physical  condition  of  RDA-established \nresettlement sites, (iv) socioeconomic conditions of self-relocated persons, and (v) special or \npotential problems brought to the consultant\u2019s attention by APs and RDA responses. Corrective \nmeasures, if needed, will be proposed in line with the RIP, and will aim at increasing its \neffectiveness and efficiency.  \n \n5.  In phase 1, the consultants will develop a monitoring framework in close consultation \nwith ADB, JBIC, and Ministry of Highways (MOH); perform a pilot verification test; and prepare a \nmethodology  to  continuously  track,  over  the  entire  TA  implementation  period,  the  level  of \nlivelihood, living standards, general level of satisfaction, etc. of APs without unduly infringing on \ntheir privacy. Additionally, the consultants will prepare a sampling strategy, questionnaire/survey \nforms for field data collection, and a time-bound work plan.  \n ", "Appendix 3  9\n6.  In phase 2, the monitoring framework will be validated through a full field test, the \nmethodology  will  be  fine-tuned  if  necessary,  and  the  work  program  will  be  finalized.  The \nconsultant will also organize a workshop involving ADB, JBIC, MOH, and other stakeholders to \ndiscuss the approach and indicators. \n \n7.  Continuous monitoring will take place during phase 3, with a workshop at the end of the \nphase.  \n \n8.   Monitoring will be biannual in phase 4. Additionally, the consultants will organize and \nconduct biannual workshops to present their findings and recommendations. They will also \nundertake a set of case studies and continue to track the set of APs chosen from the main \nsample. The case studies of the selected APs are intended to highlight the strengths and \nweaknesses  of  the  resettlement  and  relocation  processes  followed  from  the  outset,  and \nhighlight measures that could be taken to improve the processes in the future.  \n \n1.   Phase 1 (2 months) \n \n9.  Phase  1  will  require  1.5  person-months  of  continuous  on-site  services  of  the \ninternational  M&E  specialist,  2  person-months  services  each  from  the  social  development \nspecialist/team  leader  and  statistician,  and  0.5  person-months  from  the  workshop \nfacilitator/moderator. The consultants will do the following: \n  \n(i)  Prepare a monitoring framework outlining indicators, targets, measures, etc; the \nformat for the workshops and potential panel members; and the data/information \nneeded to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the RIP, and a schedule. \nThe indicators should reflect timeliness and completeness of the compensation \npaid in accordance with the entitlement matrix, ex gratia payments for early \nrelocation,  interest  payments,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  committee \n(LARC)  and  Super  LARC  payments  and  related  activities,  the  quality  of \ninfrastructure and services at RDA resettlement sites, activities of the housing \nsocieties, income levels, etc. \n(ii)  Prepare questionnaires and/or survey forms for collecting data through personal \ninterview surveys, observations, and RDA\u2019s management information system. \nData  collection  should  be  structured  to  also  capture  issues  and  concerns \nexpressed by APs in letters to RDA and the Government, and through other \nmedia.  \n(iii)  Validate  the  overall  monitoring  (data  collection  methodology,  sampling \nprocedure, size and representation as well as the sample for continuous tracking, \nand reporting format) framework using a small sample of relevant data. \n(iv)  Organize a workshop to discuss the framework and validation results as well as \nthe  proposed  work  plan  with  ADB,  JBIC,  and  MOH,  and  incorporate  any \nsuggestions/revisions and finalize the framework and schedule. \n \n2.   Phase 2 (1 month) \n \n10.  Phase  2  will  require  the  service  of  the  following  experts  (person-months  are  in \nparentheses): international M&E specialist (0.5), social development specialist/team leader (1), \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nand workshop facilitator/moderator (0.5).
