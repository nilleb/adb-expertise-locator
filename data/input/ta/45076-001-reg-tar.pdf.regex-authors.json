INTRODUCTION \n1.  Recent flagship publications of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and ADB Institute on \nregional cooperation have highlighted the need for integrated infrastructure development on a \nregion-wide  basis.  These  publications\u2014Emerging  Asian  Regionalism,  Infrastructure  for  a \nSeamless Asia, and Institutions for Integration: Toward an Asian Economic  Community1\u2014\nrecognize the importance and benefits of improving regional connectivity to support an effective \nand  efficient  economic  development  that  transcends  borders.  They  also  recognize  that \nsignificant resources will be required to enhance the connection of the region. Infrastructure for \na Seamless Asia, for example, estimates that Asia needs $8 trillion in overall infrastructure \nbetween 2010 and 2020. All three publications unanimously recommend prioritizing key projects \nand identifying alternative forms of financing to address this large infrastructure need. \n \n2.  Recognizing  the  need  for  project  prioritization  and  strong  political  commitment  for \ndeveloping infrastructure in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) subregion, \nASEAN leaders endorsed the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC) in 2010.2 The \nMPAC was developed to help realize an ASEAN Economic Community by 2015. It promotes \nconnectivity through enhanced trade, investments, tourism, and people-to-people (including \nlabor migration) movements. The MPAC represents an in-depth plan of action based on (i) a list \nof  priority  projects  for  ASEAN  connectivity,  (ii)  requirements  for  institutional  and  policy \ncoordination,  and  (iii)  recommendations  for  financing  the  key  projects.  Realizing  the  tasks \ninvolved,  ASEAN  and  ADB  discussed  a  number  of  initiatives  required  to  support  the \nimplementation of the MPAC; the design of this technical assistance (TA) was based on these \ninitiatives. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In addition to the MPAC, there are a number of other ASEAN initiatives that promote \ninfrastructure development, including those that are supported by ADB such as the ASEAN \nInfrastructure Fund (AIF).4 Based on equity investments from ASEAN and ADB, the AIF is \ndesigned to provide an innovative financing instrument to address the  ASEAN subregion\u2019s \nconnectivity constraints. In so doing, the AIF will support the MPAC as a key driver toward \nrealizing the vision for an ASEAN Economic Community by 2015. The efforts for infrastructure \nfinancing  are  combined  with  the  \u2015software\u2016  aspects  of  connectivity:  customs,  immigration, \nquarantine and security, and trade facilitation. While these initiatives provide additional support \nto realize the MPAC, other forms of due diligence support will be required to complement them: \n \n                                                \n1  ADB.  2008.

Manila. \n2  ASEAN has the following members: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The ASEAN region also \nsupport by three key subregional programs: (i) the Greater Mekong Subregion; (ii) the Brunei Darussalam\u2013\nIndonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area, and (iii) the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand Growth \nTriangle. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 November 2011.  \n4  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Equity Contribution \nand Administration of ASEAN Infrastructure Fund. Manila. 16 September. The AIF is established by ASEAN \nmember  countries  (except  Myanmar)  and  ADB  to  mobilize  financial  resources  to  support  infrastructure \ndevelopment in the ASEAN subregion. The shareholders\u2019 agreement was signed on 24 September 2011 in \nWashington, DC. \n ", "2   \n(i)  Resource mobilization. Inadequate project finance is an issue highlighted in the \nMPAC.  Because  there  are  limitations  in  public  and  official  development \nassistance financing, it is essential to mobilize additional resources from other \ndevelopment partners, the private sector, and the capital market. For example, \ncapital  market  financing  needs  to  be  developed  to  support  the  issuance  of \nrelevant instruments (such as infrastructure bonds), which are considered to \nhave investment grade credit rating. These can be anchored in the AIF and \ncomplement it. \n \n(ii)  Pipeline  development  and  due  diligence.  Given  the  priority  infrastructure \nprojects, sector and project assessments are required to ensure project viability, \ncommitment to best practices of governance, and compliance with environmental \nand  social  soundness.  The  comprehensive  assessment  of  key  risks  and \nmitigating measures are, likewise, necessary to develop a robust priority project \npipeline. Consideration of these issues and early conduct of due diligence will \nhelp catalyze financing for key projects. Finally, this process should consider \nmeasures  to  attract  private  investments  through  public\u2013private  partnerships \n(PPPs) and other modalities, as appropriate. \n \n(iii)  Consensus-building  activities.  A  series  of dialogues  and  consultations  are \nneeded to ensure that all relevant stakeholders participate. A broad development \npartnership needs to be formed to maximize collective knowledge support and \ncoordinated action based on comparative advantage. This requires considerable \nadministrative and knowledge development efforts from institutions like ADB. \n \n4.  Individual ASEAN member countries are committed to implementing the MPAC. Further, \nMPAC\u2019s  priority  projects  are  synchronized  and  consistent  with  national  priorities  and \ndevelopment  plans,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  country  programming  processes.  However,  ASEAN \nmember countries need support because of the high financial requirements of projects. While \nthe ASEAN member countries established the AIF to mobilize necessary financing on a regional \nbasis, additional support will be needed to ensure wider coordination among development \npartners  along  with  the  development  of  a  robust  project  pipeline  and  to  identify  ways  of \nenhancing participation between PPPs and the private sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The impact will be improved connectivity in the ASEAN subregion by supporting the \nimplementation of the MPAC, especially by establishing a development partnership mechanism. \nThis  is  based  on  the  recognition  that  a  wider  coordination  is  required  because  no  single \ndevelopment partner can sufficiently assume the task of supporting the ASEAN connectivity \nand/or  MPAC  implementation.  The  partnership  mechanism  will  build  on  recent  ASEAN \ninitiatives, including the AIF, as well as initiatives from other development partners so that ADB \ncan more fully leverage the operational expertise and development knowledge. \n \n6.  The  outcome  will  be  the  enhanced  coordination  among  development  partners  in \nmobilizing financing for ASEAN\u2019s infrastructure development through MPAC implementation, \nbased on the effective implementation of the AIF and other relevant initiatives. This will be \nbased  on  a  sound  project  development  process  and  consensus-building  approach  for \n ", "  3 \ninfrastructure development not only between ADB and developing member countries, but also \nwith other key development agencies as well as the private sector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will be monitored through periodic reports, consensus-building activities and \nworkshops,  and  feedback  obtained  through  regular  consultations  with  key  stakeholders.  A \nseries of smaller seminars can also be held in coordination with government agencies and other \nADB departments. Knowledge-sharing and dissemination activities will be carried out to discuss \nresults,  good  practices,  and  lessons.  Available  updates,  results,  or  observations  will  be \ndiscussed and shared in proper forums or reports. Hence, the TA will deliver the following main \noutputs: \n \n(i)  Resource mobilization due diligence, including financial analysis. The TA \nwill develop financial models for the relevant ASEAN  infrastructure financing \ninitiatives  and  augment  them  with  best  practice  models  of risk management \nframeworks  and  policies  including  liquidity,  cash  management,  and  capital \nadequacy. The analysis will also focus on the use of various capital market \ninstruments, especially debt instruments, and identify measures to enhance their \ncredit rating and liquidity. These measures will adhere to the existing relevant \nlegal frameworks of ASEAN member countries. \n \n(ii)  Project pipeline formulation due diligence. The TA will also provide initial \nscreening  of  the  projects  to  be  included  in  the  pipeline  of  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners and stakeholders. The TA will also produce reports that \ndemonstrate the viability of identified key projects. Through this component, the \nTA will identify major issues associated with project preparation and will consult \nwith the development partners and other stakeholders to ensure that high priority \nsovereign and nonsovereign projects as listed in the MPAC will have the proper \ninitial screening for eventual project preparation. The TA will also consider, in \ncoordination with the development partners and stakeholders, projects not listed \nin the MPAC but that are expected to contribute toward enhanced connectivity \n(which may include software infrastructure).5 \n \n(iii)  Stakeholder  consultation  process  for  consensus  building.  Considerable \nefforts are needed to provide operational and knowledge support to ASEAN \nmembers on the relevant projects and programs.  A coordinated approach is \nrequired since no single agency can sufficiently provide financing for all of the \nMPAC priority projects. Accordingly, the TA will facilitate consensus among the \ndevelopment partners and stakeholders. Based on this approach, consensus \nneeds to be achieved on the priority projects, policy implications, and financing \nmechanisms.  It  will  also  be  important  to  ascertain  support  from  the  key \ndevelopment  partners  to  identify  additional  support  for  various,  relevant \ninitiatives, including the AIF. 6 \n                                                \n5  This output will also consider PPPs and measures to attract private investments through other modalities. The TA \nwill identify appropriate, potential projects that could be financed by ADB and AIF, under the PPP modality. This will \nidentify and seek links with the ongoing initiatives at both regional and national levels. Linked with the financial \nanalysis component, the use of capital market instruments to support infrastructure financing will also be analyzed.  \n6  For this TA project, the development partners include relevant ASEAN members, ADB, and relevant agencies in \nJapan (as the region\u2019s key provider of development assistance and this TA). Additional partners can be identified in \ncoordination with the current partners and other stakeholders. \n ", "4   \n \n8.  The assumptions and risks on developing the TA with the above components have been \nconsidered. The assumptions are (i) regional cooperation and integration will continue to be \nrecognized by the ASEAN developing member countries as important for enhancing economic \ngrowth  and  reducing  poverty;  (ii)  based  on  the  consensus-building  approach,  the  national \npolicies will be geared towards harnessing the full benefits of regional infrastructure integration; \nand (iii) cooperation between ADB and key stakeholders (including those outside ASEAN) will \nbe ensured. The risks include (i) a global economic downturn that could lead to a policy shift \ntoward more urgent domestic economic and social concerns rather than the implementation of \nregional cooperation and integration initiatives; (ii) a lack of active participation by some ASEAN \nmembers that could hamper efforts to forge an ASEAN consensus on the key issues; and (iii) \nthe TA project\u2019s ability to produce timely high-quality outputs that are key to decision-making \nand consensus-building among the various development partners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $975,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan\u2013ASEAN Integration Fund.7 The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented from 1 January to 31 \nDecember 2012 by the Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division (SERC), \nSoutheast Asia Department, with support from other ADB departments. SERC will coordinate \nwith sector divisions and resident missions on TA findings regarding project pipeline and PPP \nproject identification. ADB will seek coordination with ASEAN and its initiatives, including the \nAIF.  In  addition,  as  part  of  the  development  partners\u2019  coordination,  various  stakeholders, \nincluding agencies from Japan, will be consulted on the key findings to identify key strategic \nareas of mutual cooperation. Based on this, additional development partners, both within and \noutside the ASEAN subregion, will also be consulted. SERC will assign one or two international \nstaff  to  supervise  the  overall  implementation  of  the  TA,  with  support  from  national  and \nadministrative staff. In addition, SERC will form an interdepartmental team of experts to support \nthe TA implementation. Key officials from ASEAN and other development partners will also \nprovide input to the TA operations. \n \n11.  A group of individual consultants (and firms as appropriate8) will provide the advisory, \ntechnical,  and  administrative  support  services.  It  is  estimated  that  26  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting services  and  25  person-months  of  national  consulting services  are \nrequired for the TA. Due to the diverse skills requirements, consultants will be engaged on an \nindividual basis or through a firm per given component in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. A team of SERC staff members, in coordination with other ADB \ndepartments, will review the outputs. \n \n12.  The purchase of equipment (computer hardware and software) will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and in \n                                                \n7  ADB will submit a periodic report on the TA administration to the relevant institutions associated with the Japan\u2013\nASEAN Integration Fund. \n8  If a firm is to be selected, then it would be based on the quality-based selection process.  \n ", "  5 \ncoordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Information  Systems  and  Technology  and  Office  of \nAdministrative Services, where applicable. After the TA completion, any procured equipment will \nbe disposed of in compliance with the project administration instructions.9 Disbursements under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n13.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $975,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan\u2013ASEAN Integration Fund for the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity \nImplementation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2009.
