INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help enhance the development \ncapacity of the civil aviation sector in Bhutan by formulating a civil aviation strategy and providing \nadvisory work and hands-on support to the executing agency and respective stakeholders.1 The \nTA will have three outputs: (i) civil aviation sector strategy plan report prepared; (ii) regulatory, \noperational, and institutional capacity enhanced; and (iii) knowledge management and capacity \nbuilding improved.2 \n \n2.  This TA is included in the country operations business plan for Bhutan, 2020\u20132022 and \nits objective is identified as one of the three pillars in the country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023: \nto improve connectivity by supporting sustainable investments and know-how to upgrade air \ntransport structures and services for a more reliable and efficient movement of people and goods.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n3.   Air transport in Bhutan. Bhutan is a landlocked, mountainous country that presents \nunique challenges to the development of transport infrastructure, including air transport. Despite \nthese challenges, continuous development in the sector remains a key priority to accommodate \nthe ever-increasing air transport demand. Between 2013 and 2018, the annual passenger traffic \nin Bhutan increased at an average of more than 10%. This is partly attributed to the government\u2019s \neffort to accelerate tourism development in the country, and the introduction of domestic air \ntransport services, which enhances access to tourist attractions in outer regions. In 2018, Bhutan \nregistered more than 397,000 international passengers, an increase from about 314,000 in 2017.4  \n \n4.  Civil aviation is essential for Bhutan\u2019s growth. It provides vital support to the development \nof tourism as well as to trade and manufacturing. Because of Bhutan\u2019s geographical features, the \ndomestic air transport network has been crucial in linking the capital city of Thimphu in the western \nregion with administrative and commercial centers in the central, southern, and eastern regions. \nFour airports facilitate these linkages: an international airport in Paro, which also caters to \ndomestic flights, and three domestic airports in Bumthang, Gelephu, and Yonphula.   \n \n5.  Paro  International  Airport.  The  Paro  International  Airport  (PIA)  is  Bhutan\u2019s  only \ninternational airport and is used by most international visitors to enter the country. The airport \nprovides air transport facilities and passenger services to two operators, the national carrier \nDrukair and the private airline Tashi Air. Inclement weather conditions sometimes disrupt the \nPIA\u2019s air transport operations, with safety regulations requiring aircrafts to divert to other regional \ninternational airports. The mountainous terrain restricts the PIA\u2019s physical expansion. Constrained \nby limited operational hours, the PIA runway\u2019s peak capacity is seven aircraft movements per \nhour. Under this scenario and with annual passengers estimated to reach over 900,000 by 2030, \npassenger volume will exceed the PIA\u2019s ultimate capacity by 2033.5  \n \n \n1  The stakeholders are the Department of Air Transport (DoAT) and the Bhutan Civil Aviation Authority (BCAA), from \nMinistry of Information and Communications of Bhutan. \n2  The Civil Aviation Act of Bhutan, 2016 defines civil aviation as the operation of any civil aircraft for the purpose of \ngeneral aviation, aerial work, or commercial air transport operations. Commercial air transport operations are defined \nas aircraft operation involving the transport of passengers, cargo, or mail for remuneration or hire. \n3  ADB. 2018.

Air transport in Bhutan also plays a pivotal role in providing aid during  emergency \nresponse or disaster relief. The country\u2019s vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change is \nhigh and adaptation measures are an absolute necessity. Moreover, the rising air traffic demand \nhas put additional pressure on the country\u2019s air transport sector, including its institutional aspect. \nThe capacity of the Department of Air Transport (DoAT) and the Bhutan Civil Aviation Authority \n(BCAA) to effectively manage the country\u2019s aviation sector, especially airports, is constrained by \nlimited funds and lack of a comprehensive sector strategy that includes short-, medium-, and long-\nterm action plans. The government\u2019s current Civil Aviation Master Plan, approved in October 2004, \ndefined, emphasized, and documented the need for a well-developed air transport system in \nBhutan up to 2030. \n \n7.  Institutional and regulatory framework. The civil aviation sector of Bhutan has been \nrestructured and has adopted several reforms since 2009. The Civil Aviation Act of Bhutan, 2000 \nwas updated in 2016 and currently serves as the instrument to regulate and administer civil \naviation in the country. The separation of regulatory and operational functions of the Department \nof Civil Aviation took place in April 2015. As a result, the BCAA serves as a regulator while the \nDoAT serves as an airport operator.6 The DoAT reports to the Ministry of Information and \nCommunications and is responsible for ensuring safe, regular, and effective operation of flights, \nair communication, navigation, and transportation services for both domestic and international \nservices.  \n \n8.  Government strategy. In line with the country\u2019s vision statement, the Government of \nBhutan developed and subsequently endorsed the Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u20132023 in 2018.7 \nThe plan identifies national key areas as development outcomes that will address priority national \nissues. The sustainable development of the tourism sector and the enhancement of climate and \ndisaster resilience capabilities were recognized as key factors that support balanced social and \neconomic growth. To enable these national development efforts, the air transport system and \nservices  are  to  be  further  improved  by  increasing  operational  capacity,  effectiveness,  and \nefficiency. Therefore, the government is considering expanding and scaling up the capacity of the \nexisting domestic airports (Bumthang, Gelephu, and Yonphula), including measures to enhance \nresponsiveness to natural disaster and climate change risks.  \n \n9.  Upgrading existing domestic airports. Gelephu is located in southern Bhutan, about 30 \nkilometers east of Sarpang, the district (dzongkhag) headquarters. Because of its flat terrain and \ntopographical conditions, the DoAT considers Gelephu\u2019s domestic airport the most feasible for \npotential upgrade and for operating as an alternate airport to PIA. The Government\u2019s Twelfth Five \nYear Plan, 2018\u20132023 identifies the expansion of Gelephu airport as a key activity of the country\u2019s \nprogram to improve air transport system in the country. The plan also recognizes Gelephu as a \nregional growth center that will improve socioeconomic development in Bhutan\u2019s outer regions \nand further enhance access to regional markets because of its proximity to India. This is also in \nline with the Bhutan National Urbanization Strategy and the Gelephu Structure Plan, which identify \n \n6 ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Strengthening Air Transport Regulatory and \n \nOperational Performance. Manila. Under this technical assistance, the legal and regulatory provisions of the civil \naviation sector in Bhutan were strengthened. By successfully separating the regulatory and operational functions of \nthe Department of Civil Aviation between the DoAT and BCAA, any conflict of interest in their roles and responsibilities \nwas eliminated. Both departments were able to manage their own staff, which helped the staff recruitment and staff \nretention. The reliability of the civil aviation sector in Bhutan was also enhanced by operating under international \nstandards.  \n7  Royal Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness Commission. 2018.

ADB contribution to Bhutan\u2019s civil aviation sector. ADB has been involved in the \ndevelopment of the civil aviation sector in Bhutan through two TA projects and one grant project \n(including additional financing). Approved in 2010, ADB\u2019s first project preparatory TA to the \nDepartment  of  Civil  Aviation  helped  formulate  the  ensuing  Air  Transport  Connectivity \nEnhancement Project.9 The project, which is still ongoing, aims to enhance capacity and security \nat the Bumthang, Gelephu, and Yonphula domestic airports.10 A separate TA focused on building \ncivil  aviation  capacity  and  improving  air  transport  regulatory  and  operational  performance \n(footnote 6). Inadequate capacity of the executing agency, the DoAT, in procurement and contract \nmanagement was identified as the key issue during project implementation, for which hands-on \nsupport from ADB consultants was provided.  \n \n11.  With ADB\u2019s involvement, the physical and institutional capacity of the sector has improved \nconsiderably to accommodate the rapid growth of air traffic since 2004. The long-term objective \nof enhancing the air transport system is also in line with the Bhutan Transport 2040 Integrated \nStrategic Vision, prepared with ADB\u2019s support in collaboration with the Government of Australia \nthrough the Australian Agency for International Development.11 ADB\u2019s engagement in the sector \nis based on the commitment to address the challenges of air connectivity and to improve access \nto external trades to ensure future economic growth and disaster preparedness.  \n \n12.  The TA will help the government formulate a comprehensive national civil aviation sector \nstrategy that incorporates sustainable development principles to meet the air transport demand, \nsolve the existing operation constraints, and enhance emergency responsiveness. The strategy \nwill also recognize the need to expand air transport services to other international hubs and \nregional centers and for an alternative arrangement for the PIA. The TA will support the DoAT to \nreview and confirm the feasibility of expanding Gelephu against the other two domestic airports \nin Bumthang and Yonphula and prepare a master plan for upgrading Gelephu that will reflect the \ngovernment\u2019s current plan and priorities.  \n \n \nIII.
