INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Maldives has requested support from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to develop and install a revenue administration management information system \n(RAMIS) and to conduct a study on revenue policies and related regulatory frameworks. A \nconsultation mission in August 2010 and fact-finding missions in October 2010 and July 2011 \nformulated the goals and strategies of the proposed technical assistance (TA) and designed its \ncorresponding activities. Extensive discussion with the government resulted in agreement on \nthe  purpose  and  outputs  of  the  TA  and  its  methodology,  key  activities,  implementation \narrangements, design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1), cost estimates (Appendix 2), \nand terms of reference for consultants (Appendix 3).1 \n \n2.  The TA supports the government\u2019s priorities as outlined in its Strategic Action Plan \n2009\u20132013, which identified the importance of implementing a four-pronged strategy to expand \nthe  country\u2019s  fiscal  space  to  effectively  meet  its  varied  challenges.  The  TA  will  increase \ngovernment revenue by improving tax compliance and enhancing the efficiency of the tax \nadministration.  ADB  mission  findings  reveal  that  national  income  sources  have  not  been \nadequately and efficiently tapped. The Maldives Inland Revenue Department (MIRA) urgently \nneeds support to strengthen revenue administration, with the goal of augmenting government \nrevenue  in  the  face  of  continued  budget  deficits  and  debt-servicing  requirements.  Greater \nrevenue mobilization will pave the way for expanding and improving service delivery across the \neconomy. \n \n3.  The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for the Maldives, 2007\u2013\n2011, recognizing that high levels of post-tsunami spending were warranted.2 However, the \nCPS warns that \u201cthe continuous increase in public consumption outlays and the widening fiscal \ndeficit have become worrying.\u201d 3 Given the country\u2019s narrow tax base, small domestic financial \nmarket, and rising public debt, the pressure on the government to tackle the deficit is mounting. \nAlthough the TA was not included in the CPS, the government has asked ADB to provide it. \nADB Management has approved the concept paper for the TA. \n \n4.  This TA supports ADB\u2019s development strategy as described in the Maldives CPS, to \n\u201cstrengthen economic and financial management in areas such as tax administration.\u201d4 ADB is \ncurrently assisting the government through the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) loan, which \nis part of a broad emergency program supported by international financial institutions, including \nan International Monetary Fund (IMF) standby arrangement.5 This TA builds on the work of the \ntax component of the ERP TA grant. The ERP TA grant sought to strengthen the administration \nof taxes and provide capacity development to improve reform strategies, assist in organizational \nrestructuring, and develop operations manuals for MIRA. The ERP TA grant conducted surveys, \nworkshops, and public awareness campaigns on tax compliance. It also reviewed and assessed \nautomation needs at MIRA, and provided recommendations on implementation of IT tools. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 April 2011. \n2  ADB. 2007.

Manila.   \n3  Footnote 2 (p. 6). \n4  Footnote 2 (p. 19). \n5  The government\u2019s emergency program seeks to introduce corrective measures to address deep-rooted distortions \n that produce economic imbalances and thereby restore the economy to a more sustainable growth trajectory over \n the  medium  term. To  achieve  these  objectives,  the  ERP  is  supporting  specific  reform  initiatives,  including \n rationalizing, prioritizing, and aligning public spending with the available resource envelope. To this end, the \n government is looking to broaden its tax base and strengthen its tax administration functions. ADB. 2009. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Loan, Technical Assistance \nLoan, and Technical Assistance Grant to the Republic of the Maldives for the Economic Recovery Program. Manila. \n ", "2     \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The government\u2019s fiscal situation is currently under stress. Government expenditures \nhave risen over the past 5 years while revenues have fallen. According to the budget estimates \nfor 2011, government expenditure as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) stood \nat 45%, compared with 40% in 2010; meanwhile, government revenue as a percentage of GDP \nin 2011 is expected to amount to 33%, compared with 37% in 2006. As a result of increasing \nfiscal deficits, government debt increased to 91.7% in 2011.6 Fiscal and tax reforms are urgently \nneeded to make public financing sustainable and avoid adverse debt dynamics. \n \n6.  To address a looming budgetary crisis, the government has agreed to fiscal and tax \nreforms.  On  the  expenditure  side,  under  an  IMF  program,  the  government  pledged  to \npermanently  reduce  government  expenditures  by  about  10%  of  GDP  in  2010  and  for  the \nfollowing 2 years. The targeted areas of expenditure containment are reductions in civil service \nsalaries and allowances, staff redundancies, electricity subsidies, and capital expenditures, and \nelimination of non-priority current expenditures. On the revenue side, the government, with \nsupport from ADB, is introducing new taxes and other revenue-enhancing measures, adding up \nto almost 10% of GDP in 2011 and 20% in 2012 (footnote 5). With ADB\u2019s policy reform advice, \nthe government introduced the business profit tax (BPT) and the Tourism Goods and Services \nTax (TGST) in December 2010, and also increased the airport tax.7 The Goods and Services \nTax (GST) Act took effect in October 2011, and personal and corporate income taxes were also \nintroduced and will take effect in January 2012.8 \n \n7.  The impending introduction of these new taxes by a government that has little previous \nexperience in tax collection poses considerable implementation risks. There are organizational, \nmanagerial, and technical gaps in the newly established MIRA. ADB seeks to fill this major gap \nthrough this TA. By helping the government manage the installation and operation of a RAMIS, \nthe  TA  will  help  equip  it  with  modern  tools  to  improve  revenue  collection  and  foster  tax \ncompliance. Successfully implemented, the TA will help the government pursue a more viable \nexpenditure  pattern  with  a  modern  tax  system.  The  experience  of  other  developed  and \ndeveloping countries in utilizing e-governance to drive revenue collection reforms suggests that \nan integrated revenue administration system could have significant effects. The infusion of \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) in tax administration would reduce human \nerrors, increase efficiency, and enhance transparency in revenue collection. Moreover, it could \ncreate  a  comprehensive  database  for  analysis  that  could  reduce  under  assessment  and \nimprove the collection rate. Compared to other South Asian countries, the Maldives is well \npoised for this type of e-governance innovation as it has the highest internet penetration in \nSouth Asia, measured in terms of the percentage of internet users in the population.9 Effectively \nestablished, this RAMIS would produce lasting advances in fiscal reforms in the Maldives. \n                                                 \n6   An increase to 91.7% in 2011 is based on 2010 IMF Article IV released in September 2011 (see Table 1, page 24). \n7  ADB, the IMF, and other international organizations have agreed on the need for a comprehensive fiscal and tax \nreform program to meet the challenges of the budgetary crisis facing the Maldives. \n8  By the end of 2011, Rf873 million and Rf146 million are to be collected as TGST and GST, respectively (a total of \nRf1 billion).   \n9  The percentage of internet usage in the Maldives is 27.2% (as of July 2011), while the percentages in other South \nAsian countries are as follows: Bangladesh (1.1%), Bhutan (7.5%), India (8.5%), Nepal (3.7%), and Sri Lanka \n(8.3%). Internet World Stats: Usage and Population Statistics. http://www.internetworldstats.com. Given that most \nof the tax base is centered in Mal\u0113, which has a substantially higher internet penetration, the automated web-based \nsystem is expected to lead to an increase in tax collection.  \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be enhanced fiscal space to implement the government\u2019s Strategic \nAction Plan.10 The impact will be measured by an increase in the ratio of tax revenue to GDP. \nThe outcome will be greater tax compliance and efficient tax administration. The outcome will be \nmeasured by (i) the higher number of registered tax filers; (ii) a reduction in the time required for \ntax  filing  management,  including appeal  and  compensation;  and  (iii)  the  lower  cost  of  tax \ncollection. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  To achieve the impact and outcome, the TA will (i) develop and install a web-based \nautomated  RAMIS;  (ii)  deliver  training  programs  for  tax  officials  and  a  public  awareness \nprogram  for  taxpayers;  and  (iii)  conduct  a  study  on  revenue  policies  and  the  regulatory \nframework for expanding the revenue base and streamlining revenue administration.11 This TA \nprovides  consultants  to  guide  the  implementation  partner  (SAP  Singapore)  in  tailoring, \ninstallation, and operationalization of the SAP software module in line with the government\u2019s \nrequirements. The government contracted with the implementation partner earlier in 2011 under \nits own budget, and will finance the procurement of equipment and facilities.12 \n \n10.  Output 1: Establishment and activation of revenue administration management \ninformation system. Detailed features of output 1 will include (i) simplified taxpayer registration \nthat will provide unique tax identification numbers, and issuance of certificates; (ii) improved \ncollection  management  through  billing  and  payment  processing,  delinquency  monitoring \n(including nonpayment risk rating, identification of defaulters, and payment monitoring); (iii) high \ntaxpayer  compliance  through  online  and  self  services  for  filing  returns  and  documents  to \nachieve compliance, assessment, and audit; and appeals to address taxpayer grievances; (iv) \nstrengthened  tax  administration  using  performance  analysis,  revenue  forecasting,  notices, \naccounting, and document management; (v) facilitated refund processing and compensation, \nincluding prefiling notice service, inputs processing, error validation, and tax-due determination; \n(vi) creation of a taxpayer database with tax identification numbers as a prerequisite for the \nimplementation  of  an  e-filing  system;  and  (vii)  online  data  exchange  between  MIRA,  the \nDepartment of Customs, and the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT); and e-tax filing, with \na provision for inclusion of digital signatures in future scaled-up operations.  \n \n11.  Output  2:  Enhanced  training  programs  on  the  revenue  administration \nmanagement information system and public awareness program. The implementation of \nRAMIS is expected to lead to a more accountable system for increasing revenue collection by (i) \nenabling access to timely and accurate information, (ii) tracking collection, and (iii) enabling \n                                                 \n10 Fiscal space refers to room in a government\u2019s budget that allows it to provide resources for a desired purpose \nwithout jeopardizing the sustainability of its financial position or the stability of the economy. \n11 RAMIS will capture collection management as well as data on collection of personal income tax (PIT), corporate \nprofit tax (CPT), business profit tax (BPT), and sales tax. Nontax revenue and customs duty will not be included; \nhowever, to give a complete picture of total revenue collected at any point and because of the substantial size of \nthe customs duty, RAMIS will provide details of the collection of customs duty and nontax revenue. \n12 The government wanted a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) approach, instead of customization approach, for \ndeveloping RAMIS. Leading enterprises in the market were invited. A competitive process for procurement \nselection was undertaken by the Government which led to the contract award to SAP in July 2011. Due to the \nintroduction of new taxes (GST, CPT, PIT, etc.), the implementation was delayed and has been initiated in \nDecember 2011. \n ", "4     \nMIRA  to  reach  out  to  taxpayers  more  efficiently  and  effectively.  The  TA  will  review  the \nsustainability of RAMIS once it is installed and operationalized. Training will be provided to \ngovernment officials on the technical aspects of RAMIS, as well as to enhance their capacity for \nchange management and to increase staff knowledge on rolling out new taxes through the \nintroduction of ICT\u2013enabled tools. Subsequently, an awareness program will be conducted to \nincrease  public  understanding  of  RAMIS  and  of  how  higher  revenue  resulting  from  its \nimplementation enables the government to address social and economic priorities.13  \n \n12.  Output 3: Newly developed revenue policies and regulatory framework. The TA will \nalso  be  used  to  (i)  broaden  the revenue  base,  improve  revenue  compliance, and  explore \nadditional tax and nontax revenue sources in the future; (ii) review relevant legal and regulatory \nframeworks for introducing new tax and nontax revenues; (iii) improve the efficiency of revenue \ncollection through a streamlined administration process; and (iv) increase accountability and \ntransparency  in  internal  governance  systems  by  reducing  human  intervention  in  revenue \nadministration. \n \n13.  In terms of impact, the TA assumes that the government will remain committed to tax \nreforms during TA implementation. Changes in the leadership of key government agencies \ncould reduce support for TA activities. At the outcome level, the TA assumes that the selected \ngovernment officials will effectively manage the tax filing system that will be developed with ADB \nsupport and that acceptance of the new system will be widespread. The risk at this level \nincludes delayed implementation of RAMIS because of resistance from tax officials and a lack of \nacceptance among stakeholders. To mitigate these risks, the TA includes training of officials \nand public awareness programs during implementation.  \n \n14.  In terms of outputs, the TA assumes that the government\u2019s demand for improving their \ntax management skills will be sufficient and that they will be able to attend training programs. \nAnother assumption is that the system will capture actual functional and technical requirements \nin MIRA\u2019s suggested solution.14 The main risks at this level are that the government officers may \nnot have sufficient capacity to understand the application training. To mitigate these risks, the \nimplementation  arrangements  will  guide  the  tax  audit  and  project  management  expert  in \nconducting relevant training.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The  government  has  asked  ADB  to  finance  $500,000  equivalent.  The  TA  will  be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The \ngovernment will provide support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation and \nsupplies,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic  transportation,  and  communications  facilities. \nDetailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n                                                 \n13 The consultants will develop the public awareness campaign in consultation with MIRA to ensure that taxpayers \nsufficiently understand and use the ICT system.  \n14 The government contracted with SAP as the implementation partner to design and install RAMIS. However, given \nthe highly technical nature of this project and the complexity involved in its implementation, there is concern about \nMIRA\u2019s insufficient technical capacity. This TA can result in bridging the gap of technical knowledge on tax audit, \nproject management capacity, tax information technology, and the government\u2019s tax policy and administration \ncapacity.   \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  MOFT will be the executing agency and will liaise with ADB on TA administration matters \nin general.15 MOFT will chair a project steering committee that will include officials from MIRA \nand the Department of Customs. MIRA will be the implementing agency and will establish a \nproject management unit (PMU) and appoint a project director as the focal point and principal \nliaison with ADB. MIRA will deploy a core PMU team to ensure smooth implementation of \nRAMIS, and the PMU team will comprise system analysts, programmers, and revenue business \nengineers.  \n \n17.  Three international consultants will be recruited to assist the PMU in managing the \noverall RAMIS implementation. These consultants will be recruited using individual selection \nmethods, in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time \nto  time).  Disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All procurements will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \nTo ensure efficient risk management, proper quality control, and review of all the deliverables of \nthe selected implementation partner for adequate and timely implementation, the TA will require \nthe services of a tax audit and project management expert (international, 10 person-months); \nand a tax ICT expert (international, 5 person-months). A tax policy and administration expert \n(international,  5  person-months)  will  be  also  recruited  to  support  the continued  tax  reform \ninitiative. A workshop will be held and a booklet on best practices and lessons learned in the TA \nwill be published. The government will fund entirely the procurement of equipment and facilities \nfor  RAMIS  and  the  procurement  procedure  will  follow  the  government\u2019s  current  rules  and \nregulations. \n \n18.  MOFT and ADB will periodically review TA implementation. The reviews will include an \nevaluation of the project\u2019s scope, implementation arrangements, progress, and the results of \ncapacity-building measures. Specifically, MOFT and ADB staff will review and provide feedback \non progress reports from the PMU. The PMU will submit the following reports: (i) an inception \nreport (to be submitted within 30 days of the project\u2019s commencement date), (ii) biannual \nprogress reports (to be submitted within 30 days after the submission of the inception report), \nand (iii) a final report (to be submitted before project completion). A draft final report will be \ncirculated 30 days prior to completion to secure comments and feedback from the government \nand ADB. A midterm review mission will be conducted at the midpoint of TA implementation. A \nfinal review mission will be made before completion of the TA. The TA will be implemented for \n26 months, from 1 February 2012 to 31 March 2014.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Maldives  for  Developing  the  Revenue  Administration  Management \nInformation System, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n15 A financial management assessment of the executing and implementing agencies was done during the loan \nprocessing for the Private Sector Development Project in 2008.
