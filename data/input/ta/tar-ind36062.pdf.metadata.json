The Government of India has sought the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) assistance \nto study the critical aspects of the proposed establishment of asset reconstruction companies \n(ARCs) in India. The technical assistance (TA) was proposed as a firm project during the \nCountry Program Confirmation Mission in February 2002 and reconfirmed during the Country \nProgramming Mission in May 2002.1 The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy of helping reduce \nvulnerabilities in India\u2019s financial sector that could place investments at risk, curtail economic \ngrowth, and endanger efforts to reduce poverty. The TA framework is shown in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The  nonperforming loans of banks and financial institutions in India as of March 2001 \nhad reached approximately Rs548 billion (about $11.2 billion) for public sector banks and \nroughly  Rs240  billion  (about  $5  billion)  for  other  financial  institutions.  The  high  level  of \nnonperforming loans has impaired the financial position of a number of public sector banks, \nweakened the financial capacity of other financial institutions, and has emerged as a major \nconcern. \n \n3.  To facilitate the early resolution of nonperforming assets (NPAs) of banks and financial \ninstitutions, the Government is considering the extensive use of ARCs in India. \n  \n4.  The Committee on the Financial Sector (Narasimham Committee 1991) first  proposed  \nan  ARC  as  a  means  of  tackling  the  burgeoning  bad  and  doubtful  accounts  of  financial \ninstitutions in India, viz., banking institutions as well as development finance institutions. An \nARC was initially conceived to be an asset reconstruction fund (ARF) that would purchase the \nNPAs of banking institutions. However, the Government opted to simply recapitalize weak public \nsector banks and allow them to handle their own NPAs.  \n \n5.  The second Narasimham Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (1998) reiterated its \nproposal but this time in the form of ARCs, inasmuch as banking institutions had already carried \nout recapitalization to some extent. It was proposed that ARCs would take over the NPAs of \nweak public sector banks by issuing and swapping their own bonds. The Government accepted \nthe idea and in the union budget for 1998/99 encouraged a few banks with high levels of NPAs \nto undertake ARCs on an experimental basis. The Government set up a task force in July 1998 \nto study the possible modalities and to prepare an operating plan for establishing ARCs in India.  \n \n6.  The Verma Committee (1999) that looked at the restructuring of weak public sector \nbanks also proposed the disposal of NPAs as a critical component in the restructuring of weak \npublic  sector  banks,  but  offered  still  another  alternative  structure  comprising  a  financial \nrestructuring authority, an ARF, and an asset management company (AMC). The financial \nrestructuring authority was to be an independent government agency owning the ARF and \nappointing the AMC, and would approve and monitor specific bank restructurings. The ARF \nwould acquire the NPAs of weak public sector banks, and the AMC\u2014proposed to be a private \nsector company\u2014would manage and dispose of the acquired NPAs for a fee.  \n \n7.  After much deliberation on the various proposals, the consensus was reached: (i) a \nproposed ARC would be established as a majority-owned private sector entity, (ii) there would \nbe multiple ARCs instead of a single centralized ARC, and (iii) a pilot ARC would be established \nunder the existing legal framework and fast-tracked. Meanwhile, a high level committee was \norganized to consider whether it was feasible to establish an ARC under the existing legal \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in  ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 7 June 2002. ", "2 \nframework. The committee\u2019s response was positive; it was agreed that a pilot ARC be set up \nwith equity contributed by major public sector and private sector banks and financial institutions \nin India. Invitations to participate were extended to multilateral financial institutions such as the \nInternational Finance Corporation, ADB, and the World Bank.2 To provide the necessary legal \nunderpinnings  for  ARCs,  the  Government  passed  the  Securitization  and  Reconstruction  of \nFinancial Assets and Enforcement of Security Ordinance, 2002 (para. 11) that has yet to be \nconfirmed by Parliament. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n8.  A  number  of  issues  still  need  to  be  weighed  carefully  to  ensure  that  ARCs  as \ncontemplated can operate successfully in the Indian environment. First, ARCs have been used \nsuccessfully in other countries principally to address systemic bank restructuring, typically after \na crisis in the financial sector, rather than as a permanent business.3 Evidence suggests that the \nuse of asset management or reconstruction companies or distinct loan workout units has played \nan important role in resolving systemic difficulties in the banking sector and could be considered \nas part of best practice.4 \n \n9.  Second,  ARCs  have  typically  been  Government  initiated  and  owned.  Under  what \nframework  and  incentive  structure  a  private  sector  ARC  should  operate  to  ensure  that \nGovernment objectives are met requires further study (para. 13).  \n \n10.  Furthermore,  to  ensure  the  viability  of  the  proposed  ARCs  and  to  facilitate  their \noperation, a number of issues remain to be addressed. The issues relate to (i) the enabling \nlegislation, (ii) taxation, (iii) asset valuation, (iv) effective operating structure for ARCs in India, \nand (v) regulatory framework for the operation of ARCs. \n \n11.  To respond to some of these issues, the Government passed Ordinance 2002, which is \ndesigned to facilitate the resolution of NPAs in the financial system. Among others, it provides \nfor the following: (i) creation of ARCs, (ii) securitization of assets, and (iii) enforcement of \nsecurity  interest.  The  latter  provides  for  (i)  extension  of  the  rights,  benefits,  permissions, \nexemptions, etc. over assigned loans or transferred securities to ARCs to enable ARCs to \nexercise powers accorded to banks and financial institutions with respect to asset reconstruction \nand securitized loans, including recourse to summary procedures for recovery of dues and to \ntake over assets or management of defaulting borrowers; (ii) inapplicability of the provisions of \n                                                 \n2  The World Bank cannot participate in the equity of the proposed pilot ARC under its present Articles; International \nFinance Corporation and ADB (through its private sector window) agreed to consider the proposal. In the \nmeantime, the Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Ltd. with an initial capitalization of Rs100 million has been \nset up with the participation of ICICI Bank, the Industrial Development Bank of India, and the State Bank of India. \nOther contributors named are IDBI Bank, HDFC Bank, and UTI Bank. \n3  The Korea Asset Management Corporation, a state-owned agency for financial restructuring, now offers asset \nmanagement and corporate restructuring as part of its regular business. Nonetheless, it was reported that the \nagency is envisaged to scale down its operations over time. \n4  However, an ARC would only address the stock but not the flow problems of banking institutions; consequently, \nsuccessful systemic bank restructuring has been accompanied by a comprehensive approach to reform that covers \nnot only the operations of affected banks themselves, but the operating environment as well. Privatization, \nrestructuring, and closure of state-owned banks, and state enterprises are typical responses that have proven \nfruitful in systemic bank restructuring (Dziobek, C. and Ceyla Pazarbasioglu. 1997. Systemic Bank Restructuring: A \nSurvey of 24 Countries. Working Paper of the International Monetary Fund. Washington, D.C. See also Klingebiel, \nD. 2000. The Use of Asset Management Companies in the Resolution of Banking Crises: Cross Country \nExperience. The World Bank, Financial Sector Strategy and Policy Group). ", "    3 \nthe  Sick  Industrial  Companies  Act5  implemented  by  the  Board  of  Industrial  and  Financial \nReconstruction on loans transferred or assigned to an ARC with the concurrence of secured \ncreditors representing not less than three fourths of the value of amount outstanding; (iii) ARCs\u2019 \nauthority to dispose of a defaulting borrower\u2019s assets under the winding up provisions of the \nCompanies Act, 1956; and (iv) setting up of a central registry.6 Ordinance 2002 also designates \nthe Reserve Bank of India as the regulating authority. \n \n12.  However, while Ordinance 2002 is decidedly a positive step, it still leaves a number of \nunresolved issues, among them the following three. (i) Given the size of the NPAs and the \nconsequent investment requirements, it is likely that the required amounts cannot be raised \ndomestically and would require involvement of international investors; however, international \nfinancial institutions without domestic branches do not appear to be covered by the definition of \nsecured creditors, and foreign lenders, except for the International Finance Corporation would \nnot ordinarily appear to have the benefit of remedies for recovering debt under Ordinance 2002. \nThe guidelines for investment in debt securities place a cap on such investments by foreign \ninstitutional investors and may also have to be revisited. Furthermore, a security receipt is \nallowed as a form of investment under Ordinance 2002, but is not considered an eligible form of \ninvestment by foreign institutional investors. (ii) Consortium lending is a common feature of \nloans in India. However, the handling of intercreditor agreements with prescribed percentages is \nnot clear; no distinction is made between first and second mortgages and it is not clear whether \nthe consortium is defined in terms of the liability or the asset secured. (iii) Indian borrowers have \nraised objections to the perceived bias against borrowers under Ordinance 2002, and lenders\u2019 \nliability to prevent abuse by creditors is being mooted. \n \n13.  Further study is needed concerning (i) the tax treatment for sold and assigned assets \nwith respect to the applicability of the stamp duty, sales tax, and the capital gains tax; (ii) the \nimplications of acquiring financial assets through the issue of debentures on vesting, transfer of \ntitle to the assets, etc.; (iii) valuation of NPAs and valuation techniques to employ with them (iv) \nthe effective operating structure for the ARCs; and (v) the regulatory framework to govern ARC \noperations,  e.g.,  prudential  norms,  guidelines  for  asset  acquisition  and  implementing \nregulations, and the appropriate regulatory authority. A number of issues arise with respect to \nthe proposed operating structure of ARCs. One is the incentive of public sector banks to \ndispose of their NPAs. Private sector ARCs are expected to bargain for the lowest possible \nprice in acquiring NPAs from banking institutions. Public sector banks are likely to face criticism \nif they sell assets below their book values. Consequently, they would need to be insulated from \nharassment suits and public criticism,7 or indemnified in case of legal actions arising from the \nnormal discharge of their duties. On the other hand, ARCs can create moral hazards for public \nsector banks whose balance sheets are cleansed with the transfer of bad assets. A clear \nrestructuring strategy would be essential to accompany debt/asset resolution that will address \nthe underlying causes that gave rise to the NPAs in the first place. Another issue relates to the \nprivate nature of the ARC. Being private, ARCs would naturally look for a quick turnaround for \nacquired NPAs and would purchase only the more promising NPAs off the books of banking \n                                                 \n5  The provisions allow borrowers to seek rehabilitation under the Act and delay the foreclosure process. The above \namendment will allow the ARC to act unimpeded should assets be transferred to it where the defaulting borrower \nhas not sought relief under the Act. \n6  ADB\u2019s TA (ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to India for Secured Transactions Reform. Manila) will help design the \narchitecture for a modern computerized registration system for all security interests on movable property and build \ncapacity for the operation of the proposed system.  \n7  One approach is to set up a separate body composed of reputable persons drawn from the Government and the \nprivate sector that would review and vet the price negotiated between a bank and the ARC for the sale of the \nNPAs. This was the approach taken in the Philippines during banking restructuring in the 1980s. ", "4 \ninstitutions. This would defeat the purpose of the Government concept of an ARC acting as a \n\u201cnursing home\u201d where distressed enterprises are restructured or rehabilitated. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The TA will help the Government design and formulate an effective ARC that will meet \nthe objectives of early resolution of the high level of NPAs of public sector banks and other \nfinancial institutions as part of the effort to reform the Indian financial system.  \n \n15.  The TA will (i) review best practices in the operation of ARCs, particularly, private sector \nARCs in other countries where they have operated; (ii) define the critical factors that have led to \nthe  success  of  ARCs  in  the  past  and  relate  them  to  the  Indian  situation,  in  the  process \npinpointing the gaps and deficiencies in the enabling environment in India for the model ARC as \ncurrently formulated and conceived in India, and recommend possible approaches and options \nthat could enhance the operation of ARCs in India; (iii) recommend an operating framework \nunder which the ARC could function and meet the various concerns (paras.12 and 13) while \nmeeting the Government\u2019s objectives; (iv) define the appropriate role of Government under the \nproposed framework, particularly with respect to required Government support; (v) recommend \na workable incentive structure for the ARC, based on best practice and given the existing legal \nand tax framework and proposed changes, to facilitate its work; (vi) recommend proven practical \nvaluation techniques and methods that can be employed to arrive at an objective value for the \nNPAs (could include auction of assets, etc.); (vii) in consultation with Indian authorities and \nfinancial  institutions  that  may  be  involved  in  the  future  operation  of  the  ARCs,  prepare  a \nfeasibility study and operating plan indicating how a model ARC in the Indian setting will \noperate; and (viii) recommend an appropriate regulatory framework for ARCs in India and the \nprocess to enable the regulatory authority to effectively oversee the ARCs\u2019 operations. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The consultants, working closely with the Government, through the Executing Agency, \nwill familiarize themselves with the concept of the pilot ARC that will be established and the \nrationale behind the specific design concept, the changes in legislation under Ordinance 2002, \nand the objectives of the Government for establishing ARCs in India. With this understanding, \nand considering best practices and consultation with various stakeholders, the consultants will \nhelp redesign the ARC that could serve as the basic model for future ARCs. The critical \nelements of the exercise will be (i) defining the operating framework that will address present \nconcerns regarding the proposed ARC and ensuring that Government objectives are met, (ii) \ndetermining alternative structures that could work in India, (iii) strengthening the legal framework \nto allow ARCs to operate smoothly in India, (iv) defining the incentive structure to facilitate ARC \noperations, and (v) proving the viability of the proposed ARC. \n \n17.  In parallel, a review will be conducted to better understand the extent and nature of \nNPAs of the target or selected public sector banks and other financial institutions. With data \nfrom  this  review  and  known  best  practices,  the  consultants  will  determine  the  various \napproaches, valuation methods, mechanisms, and strategy that will be needed to resolve the \nNPAs effectively. The nature of the NPAs will also determine the type of expertise that the \nARCs will need to manage the NPAs to be acquired. The information will also form the basis for \ndeveloping  a  restructuring  study  and  estimating  the  extent  of  recapitalization  that  may  be ", "    5 \nneeded for the affected public sector banks and other financial institutions. Other options may \nbe considered as a result of the review. \n \n18.  The support of the Government and regulatory authorities\u2014particularly in providing the \nrequired  data  and  information  and  improving  the  consultants\u2019  understanding  of  the  Indian \nenvironment and the deep-seated concerns within and without the Government regarding the \nproposed ARCs\u2014and the cooperation of the target or selected public sector banks and other \nfinancial institutions will be crucial to the efficient undertaking and successful completion of the \nTA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent, comprising $673,000 in \nforeign currency cost and $327,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will finance the entire \nforeign exchange cost plus $127,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. ADB will finance the \nTA on a grant basis from the ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will provide the \nbalance amounting to $200,000 equivalent for counterpart staff, office accommodation, and \nother logistical support requirements. The details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs (Banking Division) will be the \nExecuting Agency for the TA. It will provide suitable office space, counterpart staff, and other \nfacilities and support services to enable the consultants to accomplish their work.  \n \n21.  ADB will engage the services of an international consulting firm in collaboration with \ndomestic consultants to provide the required consulting services totaling 32 person-months: 18 \ninternational, and 14 domestic. The terms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 3. The \nconsulting firm will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \n22.  The consultants will submit an inception report within 2 weeks from the start of services. \nA  midterm  report  that  contains  the  consultants\u2019  initial  findings  and  the  work  plan  for  the \nsucceeding months until TA completion will be submitted to ADB and the Government at the \nend of 3 months. A draft final report will be submitted to ADB and the Government at the end of \n6 months. The Government, the consultants, and ADB will hold a tripartite meeting within 15 \ndays from receipt of the draft final report to discuss the report. Comments from the Government \nand ADB will be taken into account in finalizing the draft final report that is to be submitted within \n15 days of the tripartite meeting. An electronic copy of the report and at least five hard copies of \neach will be submitted to ADB and the Government. The TA is expected to start in December \n2002 and be completed by June 2003. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.
