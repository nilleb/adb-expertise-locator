In  May  1998,  the  Finance  Ministers\u2019  Meeting  (FMM)  of  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic \nCooperation  (APEC)1  endorsed  the  launching  of  the  APEC  Financial  Regulators  Training \nInitiative (FRTI) to strengthen training for national and regional financial regulators in Asia and \nthe  Pacific.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  financially  supported  FRTI  training \nactivities from the start and has been acting as the FRTI secretariat since 1998. Given the \nprogress achieved under the FRTI and the continued need for financial regulation training in the \nregion, the 15th APEC FMM on 5\u20136 November 2008 in Trujillo, Peru, extended the FRTI for 2 \nmore years and requested a continuation of ADB support. \n \n2.  This regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) is intended to provide ADB \nsupport for the APEC FRTI in the next 2 years under the APEC Finance Ministers\u2019 Process. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Since the first APEC FMM in 1994 in Honolulu, the ADB President has been invited to \nthese annual meetings and ADB staff have helped promote policy dialogue on (i) the setting of \nmacroeconomic policies, (ii) the reform of financial market infrastructure for financial sector \nstability and restructuring, (iii) the strengthening of supervisory and regulatory frameworks for \nprudent and effective financial markets, and (iv) the development of the capital markets. ADB \nhas also supported various capacity development efforts, including the APEC FRTI. ADB has \nassisted  the  forums  through  six  TA  projects2  involving  studies,  surveys,  workshops,  and \ncapacity development seminars related to the policy agenda and initiatives of the APEC Finance \nMinisters' Process. \n \n4.  The Asian financial crisis that began in 1997 exposed structural weaknesses and flaws \nin the functioning of financial markets in the affected economies. A major cause of the crisis was \nthe  inadequacy  of  financial  sector  regulation  and  supervision,  constrained  by  policy  and \ngovernance  issues,  as  well  as  low  capacity  among  banking  supervisors  and  securities \nregulators. Many APEC economies and ADB developing member countries (DMCs) have since \ncommitted themselves to implementing the core principles of banking supervision and securities \nregulation  developed  by  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  and  the  International \nOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). The current global financial market turmoil, \nwhich had its epicenter in the US subprime market in mid-2007, has been a reminder of the \n                                                 \n1  The member economies of APEC are Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Chile; the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Mexico; New Zealand; Papua New \nGuinea; Peru; the Philippines; the Russian Federation; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; the United States; and \nViet Nam. \n2  ADB. 1996.

Financial sector stability in Asia and the Pacific demands better-trained national and \nregional financial regulators. The aims of the FRTI are to (i) develop and provide broad-based \ntraining to junior and mid-level financial sector regulators and supervisors; (ii) strengthen the \ntraining  programs  for  bank  supervisors  and  securities  regulators;  and  (iii)  improve  the \ncoordination of regional and international training programs. The APEC FRTI provides training \nto APEC member economies in Asia and the Pacific (most of which are also ADB DMCs), \nincluding smaller member countries that cannot provide the training themselves, and others with \nbudget and other constraints on their training programs. \n \n6.  The first phase of the training (1998\u20132000) centered on improving the management of \nnational training programs and program quality. The second phase (since 2001) is concerned \nwith strengthening the conduct of regional and national training courses, developing training \nmaterials and distributing them to APEC member economies, and improving the coordination of \nregional and international training.  \n \n7.  ADB serves as the secretariat of the APEC FRTI, and an advisory group3 guides and \nsteers FRTI implementation. The chair of the advisory group has been rotated among the \nmembers  since  2004  to  increase  ownership.4   The  training  programs  are  held  at  ADB \nheadquarters  as  well  as  in  host  institutions  throughout  the  region. Besides  the  secretariat \nactivities, ADB funds the travel expenses of resource persons while host institutions sponsor \nsocial events. Participation in the training seminars is free of charge. Airfare, hotel, and other \ntravel-related costs are borne by the institution nominating the participant. \n \n8.  The FRTI has separate programs for banking supervisors and for securities regulators.5 \nResource persons for the banking program come from the US Federal Reserve System, the \nToronto Centre, and other institutions with considerable experience in banking supervision. \nPresenters and facilitators for the securities training program include experts from the US \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, \nthe Securities Commission of Malaysia, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Australian \nSecurities  and  Investments  Commission,  and  ADB.  The  South  East  Asian  Central  Banks \n(SEACEN) Research and Training Centre, the main regional training institution for banking \nsupervisors in Asia, is a member of the advisory group. \n \n9.  In its 10 years of existence, the FRTI has strengthened the content and management of \nnational training programs and developed regional programs. Training programs based on the \ncore curricula developed under the initiative have been put in place or upgraded. FRTI training \nresources  are  also  used  in  nationally  led  training  programs.  A  website \n(www.adb.org/Projects/APEC)  has  been  created  to  facilitate  information  dissemination  and \n                                                 \n3  The members of the advisory group are from APEC member economies, as follows: (i) for bank supervision, \nAustralia; Brunei Darussalam; the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; the Republic of \nKorea; Malaysia; the Philippines, Singapore; the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN); Taipei,China; \nThailand; the United States; and Viet Nam; and (ii) for securities supervision, Australia; the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; New Zealand; the Philippines, Singapore; \nTaipei,China; Thailand; the United States; and Viet Nam. \n4  The organization structure of APEC FRTI can be found on the ADB project website for the APEC Financial \nRegulators Training Initiative. http://www.adb.org/Projects/APEC/structure.asp \n5  The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other donors have also provided capacity development TA \nto policy makers and regulatory bodies in the region through the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening \n(FIRST) initiative.  ", "  3\nexchange. The unique networking possibilities among staff and resource persons have been \nparticularly welcomed by the various regulatory and supervisory bodies in the region. The APEC \nmember economies have also derived substantive ancillary benefits from the country case \nstudies and the sharing of individual country experiences. Since 2001, the FRTI has trained \nmore than 2,300 participants in 37 banking supervision seminars (9 national, 28 regional) and \n26 securities regulation seminars (4 national, 22 regional). Non-APEC economies have been \nparticipating more and more in the training.  \n \n10.  Each  training  program  is  evaluated  by  seminar  participants  and  the  FRTI  itself  is \nevaluated yearly by advisory group members through a survey. Evaluation and survey results \nare compiled yearly and discussed at the annual meeting of advisory group members usually \nheld in the third quarter. The training programs for the following year are also decided on at this \nmeeting. The annual evaluation surveys assess the quality and effectiveness of seminars and of \nthe approaches and methods used. The results of the assessment provide a basis for the \ndesign of training programs and enable advisory group members to suggest specific ways in \nwhich the programs can be further strengthened and improved to meet training needs. The \nevaluations include a summary measure of the value of each seminar based on the participants\u2019 \nassessment  of  the  usefulness  of  the  knowledge  and  skills  gained  in  their  current  work \nassignments, and their general satisfaction with the course. The results of the evaluation survey \namong  advisory  group  members  in  2008  indicated  a  high  degree  of  satisfaction  with  the \nprograms and general attainment of the overall objectives. FRTI programs are quite distinct \nfrom university programs: they are directed at working-level staff6 and draw heavily on the \nexpertise of incumbent regulators in addressing specialized and current financial issues.  \n \n11.  The  continued  implementation  of  the  FRTI  was  supported  by  the  advisory  group \nmembers at their last annual meeting in September 2008, in acknowledgment of the constant \nneed for regional training programs, and from the APEC finance ministers at their last meeting \nin Peru. Regional training programs promote closer coordination of regulatory approaches, \nparticularly  on  topics  that  are  relatively  new.  The  possibility  of  offering  short  but  in-depth \nseminars (2\u20133 days) tailored to the specific needs of member economies will also be explored. \nThese seminars would increase awareness and deepen understanding of policy issues and \nsuggested ways of dealing with them. While FRTI courses are designed primarily for the APEC \neconomies and ADB member countries in the region, the advisory group members agreed not \nto limit participation in view of the positive effects of diversity\u2014easier international comparisons \nof practices, enriched group work and discussions, and expanded networks.  \n \n12.  APEC has helped the FRTI solicit resource speakers from more advanced economies. \nTheir participation, however, depends on the availability of senior staff of regulatory agencies, a \nfactor that could limit the effectiveness of the training. For the follow-up regional TA, resource \nspeakers from ADB, but not necessarily APEC, member economies may be invited to share \ntheir views and knowledge of best practices. Advisory group members support such a move. \nInternational organizations like IOSCO and SEACEN may also be invited to conduct future \nseminars. Closer collaboration with these providers will be promoted. Links to their respective \nwebsites are available on the ADB project website. \n                                                 \n6   Information on the FRTI training programs is available on the ADB project website for the APEC initiative: \nhttp://www.adb.org/Projects/APEC/banking.asp  ", "4        \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA support for the FRTI is expected to improve compliance with international best \npractices in banking and securities supervision and regulation. As a result, financial sector \nregulators  and  supervisors  should  become  better  able  to  coordinate  and  monitor  financial \ninstitutions and systems and respond effectively to emerging issues.  \n \n14.  The TA will support the implementation of ADB\u2019s regional cooperation and integration \nstrategy by contributing to monetary and financial cooperation and integration (the third strategic \npillar). The TA is also in line with the key result areas of the Office of Regional Economic \nIntegration  of  supporting  capacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening,  promoting \nregional  economic  policy  dialogue,  and  conducting  research  on  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will have three outputs:  \n \n(i)  Output 1: Regular updating of financial market supervision and regulation \nknowledge in the region. The FRTI has made good progress in achieving its \ntwo original objectives: strengthening the content and management of national \ntraining programs, and developing regional programs for junior and mid-Ievel \nsupervisors and regulators. The TA will continue to support the APEC FRTI for 2 \nmore years7 through training programs, conferences, and seminars as well as \nadvisory group meetings; the upgrading of the APEC FRTI project website; and \nefforts to market the training programs. \n(ii)  Output 2: Up-to-date training of financial market supervisors and regulators \nby national training institutions. The TA will support the updating of course \ncurricula  and  materials  by  financial  supervisory  authorities  and  regional \ninstitutions, and the continued building of a critical mass of potential trainers in \nthe region through the training of selected officials. \n(iii)  Output 3: Independent evaluation to assess the impact of the FRTI. An \nindependent evaluation of the FRTI will be conducted after 10 years of support to \nassess (a) its impact in improving the methodology, quality, and effectiveness of \nfinancial sector regulation and supervision; (b) its relevance as a mechanism for \nmaking financial sector regulators and supervisors better able to monitor and \ncoordinate  financial  institutions  and  systems  and  to  respond  effectively  to \nemerging issues; (c) the extent to which it is relevant and complementary to \ntraining programs provided by other institutions; (d) the quality, accessibility, and \napplication of its knowledge products, including its course materials and website; \n(e) the efficiency and effectiveness of its governance arrangements, including the \nmembership  and  structure  of  the  advisory  group,  and  the  operation, \nadministration, and performance of the APEC FRTI secretariat; and (f) options for \nsustaining an effective training initiative. \n                                                 \n7  Extensions of the APEC FRTI are endorsed yearly by the APEC FMM. However, this TA proposes ADB support for \nthe next 2 years, as strongly recommended by the APEC advisory group members. ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, to be financed with a grant from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding  program  (TASF-IV).  This  amount  covers  the  remuneration  and  travel  expenses  of \ninternational and national consultants, the travel expenses of seminar and conference resource \npersons, the upgrading of training programs, and other miscellaneous expenses. Activities in \nnon-ADB member countries and the procurement of resources from those countries (including \nthe  participation  of  resource  persons  as  well  as  trainees)  are  not  covered.  The  TA  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency, and the Office of Regional Economic Integration will \nimplement the TA, in close collaboration with the advisory group of the APEC FRTI.  \n \n18.  The  TA  activities  will  be  implemented  with  the  help  of  international  and  national \nconsultants. In support of APEC FRTI activities, the TA will fund (i) at least 16 training programs \non  priority  topics  for  banking  and  securities  supervisors  and  regulators;  (ii)  at  least  two \nconferences or seminars where ideas on relevant topics in financial market supervision and \nregulation can be discussed and exchanged; (iii) two advisory group meetings to review the \noutcome of the training initiative and determine future APEC FRTI training needs; (iv) the \nupgrading of the APEC FRTI project website and intensified marketing of the training program; \n(v) the updating of course curricula and materials; and (vi) an independent evaluation of the \nimpact of the APEC FRTI. Through discussions within a community of experts made possible by \nADB\u2019s active participation in this process, ADB staff can also learn new approaches to dealing \nwith specific policy issues. These new ideas may be useful in ADB\u2019s own policy dialogue with its \nDMCs and in DMC reform programs. Thus, the governance, finance, and trade divisions of the \nregional departments will be encouraged to participate as far as possible in the seminars, either \ndirectly or indirectly, by providing inputs and feedback on ADB\u2019s contribution. \n \n19.  The  TA  will  require  about  13  person-months  of  international  consulting  services, \n24 person-months of national consulting services, and 12 person-months of resource persons\u2019 \nparticipation. The TA will be implemented over 2 years, from April 2009. Consultants and \nresource  persons  will  be  hired  individually  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The scope of work and outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will conform to \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.8\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Support for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Financial Regulators Training Initiative, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.
