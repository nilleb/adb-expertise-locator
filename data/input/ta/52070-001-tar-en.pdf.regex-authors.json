INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will prepare development \nmaster plans and enhance capacity development for the energy sector\u2019s regional cooperation and \nintegration (RCI) under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program. It \nwill cover Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.     \n \n2.  The TA will support the implementation of the SASEC Operational Plan, 2016\u20122025, which \nSASEC member countries endorsed in 2016.1 In 2017, SASEC finance ministers endorsed the \nSASEC Vision\u2014the overarching framework and long-term strategy to support partnership among \nmember countries\u2014at a meeting in Delhi.2 SASEC officials agreed upon the flagship initiatives in \nthe SASEC Vision at a subsequent meeting in Yokohama. The initiatives highlighted energy \nsecurity and connectivity across the SASEC subregion to enhance cross-border power trade and \nimprove  regional gas  supply  value  chains.3 To  promote these  activities,  SASEC  members \naccepted the need for TA when the Asian Development Bank (ADB) presented the concept at the \nSASEC nodal official meeting in Singapore in March 2018.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  To support RCI in the energy sector under SASEC, ADB has financed a series of regional \nTA programs, including recent studies that indicated significant regional benefits of cross-border \npower trade among the countries of SASEC and the South Asian Association for Regional \nCooperation (SAARC).5 Cross-border power trading opportunities have rapidly expanded and \nbeen realized through physical transmission interconnections among some SASEC countries. \nThe national electricity grids of Bangladesh and India, for example, were interconnected in 2013. \nWhile interconnections between India and Nepal were once limited to the border areas, a high-\ncapacity  grid  interconnection  was  commissioned  in  2016.  Bhutan  and  India  have  been \nconstructing another high-voltage transmission link to evacuate about 3,000 megawatts from \nhydropower projects in Bhutan. Thus, these four countries have been physically and technically \nlinked through India\u2019s national grid, and additional interconnection and power trading opportunities \nare being discussed. ADB has financed some of the RCI projects, such as (i) the grid connections \nbetween Bangladesh and India and between Bhutan and India, (ii) some hydropower exports from \nBhutan to India, and (iii) grid strengthening within Nepal for power import and export. Recently, \nIndia also started exporting power to Myanmar. In addition, India and Sri Lanka have been working \nclosely on a feasibility study for a cross-border transmission link.   \n \n4.  SASEC members comprise one of the fastest growing subregions with huge potential to \nexpand cross-border power trading further. Indigenous energy resources, including coal, gas, \nhydropower, and other renewable energy sources, represent major opportunities for regional \ndevelopment. These different resources have complementarities for optimal utilization in the \neffective energy mix across the different countries and seasons.6 Despite the potential for more \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Operational Plan, 2016\u20122025. Manila.  \n2  ADB. 2017. SASEC: Powering Asia in the 21st Century. Manila. \n3  The three focuses in the energy sector are (i) cross-border power trade, (ii) gas storage terminals, and (iii) gas \npipeline connectivity.  \n4  The TA concept paper was approved on 25 April 2018. \n5  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Cross-Border Power Trade \nDevelopment. Manila. This TA was closed in 2017. The TA estimated investment benefits of more than $2,000 million \nthrough  cross-border  transmission  interconnections  among  Afghanistan,  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  Nepal, \nPakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tajikistan.    \n6  Each country has contrasting energy demand and supply patterns. For example, India and Bangladesh have their \npeak power demand in the summer, while Bhutan and Nepal have the peak in the winter.  \n ", "2 \npower trade, power flows are constrained by physical and nonphysical issues, including (i) limited \ntransmission connection points and capacity, (ii) uncoordinated development plans of generation \nprojects, (iii) complicated offtake and commercial contractual arrangements for power trade, \n(iv) inadequate regulatory and policy platforms and coordination mechanisms, (v) weak benefit \nassessments and risk-mitigation arrangements, and (vi) insubstantial financing instruments for \ncapital-intensive investments. As an emerging need, SASEC members are paying more attention \nto renewable energy because of the growing focus on climate change. However, the subregion \nhas not realized its renewable energy potential. The weather-dependent and unstable nature of \nthe output, which has led to operational control difficulties in the grid systems, has become a \ntechnical concern for the grid operators. This opens up an opportunity for a regional strategy to \naddress how to stabilize the power flows using backup hydropower from countries such as Bhutan \nand Nepal and/or any advanced battery systems for renewable energy expansion. \n \n5.  In addition to the intra-regional optimization of different energy resources, SASEC needs \nto focus on wider regional connectivity and more efficient energy transshipment in order to \nrespond to its increasing dependence on energy imports from outside the subregion. For example, \nin response to the depletion of its domestic gas reserves, Bangladesh plans to import more power \nand liquefied natural gas (LNG). To meet the growing domestic demand for fuels, India is also \nexpected to import more LNG, which is considered cleaner than coal and diesel. Maldives and \nSri Lanka are also considering importing LNG for power generation and other uses. All SASEC \ncountries have largely depended on the importation of other fuels, including liquified petroleum \ngas (LPG). In many cases, these resources are shipped from the Middle East or Singapore by \nsmall vessels because of constraints such as shallow water ports, insufficient storage facilities, \nand sparse pipeline networks. This has led to inflated import costs. The supply chain for LNG and \nLPG can be improved through regional shipping or terminal arrangements with more efficient \nnetworks of inland and coastal transport corridors of SASEC countries along the Bay of Bengal.7  \n \n6.  Regional energy cooperation on power and gas supplies will benefit from lowering the \nenergy costs of individual countries, improving energy security, and contributing to climate change \nmitigation. For these purposes, ADB and the SASEC countries agreed on the SASEC Operational \nPlan,  2016\u20122025.  The  plan  indicated  possible  investment  project  pipelines  and  energy \noperational priorities to (i) improve interconnections in order to access large electricity and natural \ngas sources; (ii) harness unused regional indigenous hydropower potential; (iii) develop low-\ncarbon alternatives including solar and wind; and (iv) facilitate bilateral and regional coordination \nmechanisms and knowledge sharing, such as technology transfer development practices toward \na regional power trading market. The SASEC Vision subsequently highlighted regional power and \ngas cooperation as the flagship initiatives. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  Past ADB assistance programs have focused on region-wide planning and modeling \nanalysis to assess and advocate RCI in the energy sector, and some actions on physical \nconnectivity have been initiated between some countries. To promote this development thrust, \nthe TA will focus on more specific investment projects identified in the SASEC Operational Plan, \n2016\u20122025; take problem-solving approaches on common issues related to the past and ongoing \nprojects and proposals; and apply lessons from them to future investment projects. \n                                                \n7  One possible approach is to bring large vessels from the Middle East or Singapore to some regional hub terminals, \nand then break the bulk fuels to be shipped or transported to many consumption points.   \n ", "3 \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Investment in cross-border energy trade and \ncooperation increased. This will be supported through (i) improved interconnections of electricity \nand gas supply networks; (ii) exploited renewable energy potential including hydropower, solar, \nand wind; and (iii) enhanced coordination and knowledge sharing among SASEC countries. The \nTA will have the following outcome: cross-border projects and/or programs ready for investment \nsupport prioritized. This outcome can be realized through the TA outputs.8  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  The TA will focus on the power and gas subsectors, and their capacity development \nactivities.  \n \n10.  Output 1: Development master plans for cross-border power trade prepared. Using \ninternational best practices and case studies on the SASEC Operational Plan\u2019s project priorities \nand pipelines, the TA will develop a master plan\u2014including regional development strategies, road \nmaps,  and  project  inventories\u2014based  on  multi-criteria  analysis.  This  will  be  done  through \nassessments of project pre-feasibility studies, investment cost estimates, development options, \ntechnical  requirements,  regulatory  frameworks,  commercial  and  institutional  arrangements, \nclimate change impacts, and any other focus areas.9 In 2017, SASEC established the Cross-\nBorder Power Trade Working Group, comprising mainly each government\u2019s power or energy \nministry, planning agency, and/or transmission and generation utilities. The working group will \npromote effective power trading arrangements and project assessments.10 The development of \ncross-border regulatory frameworks will also be coordinated with the SAARC Council of Experts \nof Energy Regulators (Electricity), which was established in line with the 2014 SAARC Framework \nAgreement for Energy Cooperation (Electricity).11    \n \n11.  Output 2: Development master plans for regional gas cooperation prepared. As with \nthe cross-border power trade, the TA will develop a master plan for the gas business. The plan \nwill include regional development strategies and road maps, and project inventories based on \nmulti-criteria analysis through assessments of project pre-feasibility studies, investment cost \nestimates, development options, technical requirements, regulatory frameworks, commercial and \ninstitutional arrangements, climate change impacts, and any other focus areas. In 2017, ADB \ndiscussed the concept of LNG and LPG transshipment with relevant countries based on the \nSASEC Vision\u2019s initiatives. This will be extended to more strategic approaches for the SASEC \nsubregion. Through market assessments of potential regional hubs across the SASEC subregion, \ntheir feasibility assessments and strategic investment plans will be prepared in coordination with \na working group to be organized. To create more enabling investment environment, the TA will \nalso harmonize regulatory rules and standards and safety management among the countries.   \n \n12.  Output 3: Knowledge on advanced energy technologies increased. To make the \nabove outputs and their activities practical, the TA will include knowledge sharing and capacity \ndevelopment on advanced technological applications and other regions\u2019 RCI programs and \n                                                \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  In case any feasibility studies were already done, further assessments can be considered to clarify any other due \ndiligence aspects and strengthen the results when appropriate.      \n10 In 2017, SASEC\u2019s first meeting on cross-border power trade finalized further study and capacity enhanced areas, \nincluding (i) economic and financial feasibility and institutional studies for some potential cross-border transmission \nprojects; (ii) offtake, transmission services, and commercial options of hydropower projects; (iii) possible expansion \nof transmission connectivity to Myanmar; and (iv) knowledge and experience sharing on energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy integration, the power exchange market, and smart grid elements.   \n11 ADB supported the council\u2019s meetings in 2016 and 2017, and the council identified a gap analysis in relevant laws \nand regulations and strategic road map assessments. \n ", "4 \nactivities. Advanced technologies can include efficient operations of LNG and LPG terminals and \nstorage facilities, as well as renewable energy and its battery substation facilities.12 To incorporate \nlessons from other regional programs, the TA will update progress and issues of the Greater \nMekong Subregion, the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, and/or any other RCI \nprograms. Relevant knowledge sharing seminars and site visits will also be conducted.  \n \n13.  If projects and/or investments are identified as feasible, ADB will consider providing \nadditional support to make them happen through further financial due diligence and structuring in \nconsultation with relevant countries. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) and (ii) $1,500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. The \nkey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund will mainly support the knowledge sharing and \ncapacity development activities under output 3, including a project site visit to enable a delegation \nfrom SASEC member countries to learn about advanced technologies.13 JFPR will support \nactivities related to outputs 1 and 2.14  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years in coordination with the respective energy sector \nagencies in SASEC countries. ADB will be the executing agency and will carry out the TA in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s rules and procedures.15 \n \n17.
