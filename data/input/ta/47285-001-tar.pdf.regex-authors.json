The Cities Development Initiative for Asia (CDIA) was established in February 2007 as a \njoint initiative of the Asian Development Bank (ADB); the governments of Austria, Germany, \nSpain, Sweden, and Switzerland; the Nordic Development Fund; and the Shanghai Municipal \nGovernment; with additional funding from KfW.1 This technical assistance (TA) will channel \ndevelopment partners\u2019 funds to support the implementation of the CDIA Strategy and Business \nPlan  (SBP),  2013\u20132017  to  enable  it  to  expand  its  support  to  cities  in  undertaking  urban \ninfrastructure development focusing on pro-poor and environmentally sustainable projects.2 The \nframework is provided in Appendix 1. 3 \n \n2.  The proposed regional capacity development TA aims to attract about $14.084 million in \ndevelopment  partners\u2019  funding  for  CDIA  activities.  The  contributions  will  come  from  the \ngovernments of Austria and Sweden, the Department for International Development of the \nUnited  Kingdom,  and  the  Rockefeller  Foundation  (through  the  Urban  Climate  Change \nResilience  Trust  Fund  under  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership  Facility  [UFPF]).4 Additional \nfunding  to  support  CDIA  activities  from  current  and  other  development  partners  is  also \nanticipated. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  It is estimated that by 2050, over 66% of Asia\u2019s population would be living in urban \nareas.5 Overall, the rate of urban growth will be more than double the rate of national average \npopulation  growth  across  all  of  Asia.  To  respond  to  the  needs  of  its  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs), ADB must help them maximize the development opportunities arising from \nurbanization  while  addressing  the  escalating  negative  social  and  environmental  impacts. \nUnderserviced urban growth often leads to congestion, pollution, and a decline in environmental \nquality. Nearly one-third of the region\u2019s urban poor lack access to safe water; almost half do not \nhave  adequate  sanitation  services;  and  about  the  same  proportion  live  in  dangerous \nenvironments. It is estimated that at least 900 million urban dwellers living in low- and middle-\nincome countries will be at risk from the direct and indirect impacts of climate change over the \nnext 5\u201310 years. These challenges make urban development increasingly difficult for many \nDMCs to manage.  \n                                                \n1   At the apex of the Cities Development Initiative for Asia (CDIA) governance structure is the multidonor CDIA \nProgram Review Committee, which is its governing body. The day-to-day operations are led by a management \nteam that includes program coordinators from ADB and GIZ. \n2   The CDIA SBP builds upon the experience gained in the first 5 years of CDIA operations, incorporates input from \nan external midterm review mission (October 2011), and benefits from the reflections of CDIA\u2019s program review \ncommittee on this experience. The key focus of the SBP includes (i) strengthening service delivery processes to \ncities to bridge the capacity gap by working with partner organizations (national and regional) to support cities in \npreparing infrastructure investment projects; (ii) strengthening the link to finance to bridge the planning\u2013financing \ngap  by  enhancing  city  capacities  to  access  finance  for  sustainable  urban  infrastructure  projects;  and  (iii) \nstrengthening the CDIA as a catalyst for innovation to bridge the institutional gap by providing knowledge and \ninnovation support for sustainable urban infrastructure investment to stakeholders. \n3   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 October 2013. \n4   Urban Financing Partnership Facility (UFPF) was approved by the Board (i) to establish the Urban Infrastructure \nFund (UIF), a multi-donor fund to support technical assistance (TA), grant components of investment projects, and \nany other activities that may be agreed upon between financing partners and ADB; (ii) establish bilateral urban \ninfrastructure trust funds substantially upon the terms and conditions of this paper; and (iii) accept and administer \ncontributions by bilateral, multilateral, and individual sources to the UIF and urban infrastructure trust funds. \n5  United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat). 2010.

ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 sets the goal of making Asia\u2019s cities livable.6 The overall aim is to \nhelp DMCs establish a sustainable pattern of development that will enable people to satisfy their \nbasic needs and enjoy a better quality of life without compromising the quality of life of future \ngenerations.  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Operational  Plan,  2012\u20132020  seeks  to  define  an  effective  and \nresponsive approach to supporting cities in this role.7 One of the main components of such an \napproach is for ADB to focus its interventions on specific urban regions, especially secondary \ncities, which have limited capacity but will come under proportionately greater population stress, \nand where ADB can have more impact and larger demonstration effects to foster systemic \nchange toward sustainability.8 It has been projected that by 2015, nearly 60% of the total urban \npopulation will be living in secondary cities. \n5.  While urban planning has improved across the region, many cities in Asia and the \nPacific  lack the (i) resources to undertake adequate infrastructure investment financing and \nstructuring, and prepare bankable projects; and (ii) institutional capacity to effectively manage \nthe programming and prioritization of these strategic investments. Therefore there is a gap \nbetween cities\u2019 strategic development plans that typically present a wish-list of projects, and the \nrequirements of financiers for well-formulated infrastructure projects. Many city governments in \nthe  region  also  lack  the  necessary  funding  to  deliver  critical  infrastructure  to  make  them \ncompetitive. \n \n6.  With the emphasis on project preparation and linking proposed projects to finance, the \nCDIA is viewed as a key initiative that will help implement ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u2013\n2020, together with the UFPF.  \n  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced management of secondary cities in DMCs. The \noutcome will be improvement in operational support for management of cities in DMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The CDIA is a flagship international partnership developed by ADB with financial support \nfrom development partners to help medium-sized cities in the Asia and Pacific region bridge the \ngap  between  their  development  plans  and  the  implementation  of  their  infrastructure \ninvestments.  The  CDIA  uses  a  demand-driven  approach  to  support  the  identification  and \ndevelopment of urban infrastructure investment projects within the framework of existing city \ndevelopment  plans  that  emphasize  one  or  more  of  the  following  impact  areas:  (i)  urban \nenvironmental improvement, (ii) urban poverty reduction, (iii) climate change mitigation and \nadaptation, and (iv) improved governance. \n \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n8   Second-tier  cities  generally  have  populations  of  approximately  250,000  to  3,000,000.  The  preference  for \nsecondary cities does not preclude interventions in megacities where significant environmental and social issues \nneed to be addressed, and where there is demonstrable commitment to effective, integrated approaches to \nimplementation. \n ", "  3 \n9.  Since 2007, under ADB\u2019s leadership, the CDIA has become an international partnership \nthrough the Technical Assistance for Managing the Cities in Asia9. This TA was originally \napproved  in  2007  and  has  gone  through  scope  changes  to  accommodate  funding  from \ndevelopment partners as well as from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund, ADB has \nraised  almost  $23.72  million  for  the  CDIA  since  its  inception10.  As  of  October  2013,  83 \nprefeasibility studies have been initiated for 55 Asian cities in 14 countries.11 Of these, 58 \nprefeasibility studies have already been completed, of which 26 have been linked to a financial \nsource for downstream project implementation.12  \n \n10.  The outputs of the proposed TA will be (i) project preparatory interventions in the form of \nprefeasibility studies with a view to attracting downstream financing in 50 cities; (ii) International \ngood practices involving innovative financing approaches for sustainable urban development \nadopted  in  ADB  urban  operations;  and  (iii)  strengthening  of  CDIA  networking  activities,  in \nparticular with national partner organizations. Subject to the demand from city governments and \navailability of appropriate partner institutions, efforts would be made to identify possible centers \nof excellence to promote sustainable urban development in the Asia and Pacific region. \n \n11.  Building on the achievement of Managing the Cities in Asia, this TA also aims to raise \nand deploy cofinancing from development partners to support the implementation of the CDIA \nSBP, 2013\u20132017. This TA will be an umbrella operational arrangement to accommodate in an \nefficient manner development partners\u2019 contributions, and enhance administrative coordination \nand efficiency. Because this TA is a funding channel for CDIA activities, any future increases in \nthe amount for this TA will be processed through changes in scope, based on the established \nprocedures to incorporate such increases in the TA budget.  \n \n12.  The project design is based on the following assumptions: (i) DMC stakeholders and \npolicy makers support improvement in the management of cities, (ii) better knowledge and \npolicy  dialogue  translate  into  more  effective  management  of  cities,  (iii)  there  is  continued \ninterest by financial institutions in funding urban infrastructure in Asia, (iv) there is effective \nengagement of some key regional and DMC resource people, and (v) CDIA program review \ncommittee members\u2019 financial commitments toward the CDIA SBP are fulfilled on time. Potential \nrisks relate to nonavailability of suitable experts and institutions for involvement in the analytical \nwork. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  This TA is estimated to cost $14,084,000 of which (i) $7,084,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of Sweden, (ii) $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by \n                                                \n9   ADB. 2005.

ADB  has  already  held  discussions  with  a  number  of  development  partners  and \nanticipates that more funds from  development  partners may  be  available  to finance  CDIA \nactivities in support of its SBP. It is expected that all such funds raised from the development \npartners will be administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  Participating  DMC  governments  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \nequipment,  office  and  housing  accommodations,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance, \ndomestic transport, resource persons, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency of this TA, which will start in November 2013 and end \nin December 2017. The TA will finance consulting services; workshops and training, including \nresource persons; report preparation and communications; miscellaneous administration and \nsupport costs; and equipment and surveys. Resource persons will be engaged on an individual \nbasis. A multidisciplinary team of national and international experts, led by an international \nsenior municipal or environmental engineering and urban infrastructure specialist or a project \nfinance specialist, will be required to successfully execute the assignments. Consultants may be \nrecruited  on  an  individual  basis  or  through  firms,  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection, \nquality-based  selection,  or  fixed  budget  selection  methods  with  indefinite  delivery  contract \nassignment, as appropriate.14 Key expertise will include waste and wastewater management, \nflood and drainage management, urban economics, transport planning, urban planning, water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  environment,  climate  change,  social  development,  public  financial \nmanagement,  infrastructure  finance,  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPP),  urban  governance, \norganizational and institutional development, communications, and capacity development. All \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix  3.  All  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time).15 The TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n17.  The input of 370 person-months of international consultants is envisaged with the input \nof 584 person-months of national consultants. The international consultants\u2014the municipal or \nenvironmental  engineering  and  urban  infrastructure  specialist  (185  person-months),  urban \nplanner (55 person-months), and PPP specialists and financial analysts (130 person-months)\u2014\nwill be responsible for providing the strategic and technical direction for the prefeasibility studies, \nquality assurance for the inputs, program management, and all key reporting related to the \n                                                \n13  Contributors: the Government of the United Kingdom and the Rockefeller Foundation. \n14  This TA builds on an earlier regional TA, which obtained approval from the principal director of ADB\u2019s Operations \nServices and Financial Management Department on 11 February 2009 regarding the use of indefinite delivery \ncontracts. The objective of the proposed indefinite delivery contracts is to streamline the process of consultant \nprocurement, thereby improving the accountability of project teams while retaining the required flexibility and \nresponsiveness of demand-driven CDIA operations.   \n15  A procurement plan will be prepared and updated in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. The plan will contain \ndetails of procurement; i.e., the number of contracts, procurement methods, estimated contract values, and \nthreshold amounts.  To  decide  on  the  most  economical ways  to  procure  the contracts,  the  Regional  and \nSustainable Development Department will consult ADB\u2019s Office of Administrative Services, which will procure the \ncontracts for the projects as part of ADB\u2019s institutional procurement contract. \n ", "  5 \nCDIA. They will coordinate closely with the DMCs, ensuring that key institutions and civil society \nare at all times engaged in the process of the prefeasibility studies development. \n \n18.  The national consultants\u2014urban and infrastructure national specialists (40 consultants, \n584  person-months)\u2014will  provide  high-quality  assistance  and  inputs  for  the  international \nconsultants,  backed,  where  needed,  by  strong  data  analysis. The  national  consultants  will \nsupport the activities of international consultants in the field, reviewing documents and literature, \ncollecting data and information, and performing research and analysis (both quantitative and \nqualitative). The national consultants will coordinate with governments, other donors, and other \nADB projects as needed. As additional development partner funding is secured for this TA, the \nperson-months will be increased accordingly. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n \n19.
