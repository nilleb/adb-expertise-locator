INTRODUCTION\n1. In late 1992, the Government of the People's Republic of China (the PRC)\nrequested the Bank for technical assistance (TA) to prepare an investment project for ethnic\nminority communities in the southwest part of the country, based on the recommendations\nmade by a previous Bank-financed advisory technical assistance (TA)!'. A Bank Fact-Finding\nMission visited the PRC from 7 to 22 January 1993. The Mission conducted field visits to the\nprovinces of Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi and held discussions with potential beneficiaries\nand officials at all levels of the Government. This TA proposal is based on the Mission's\nfindings and the understandings reached with the Government?J.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\nA.\t Background\n2. Ethnic minorities in the PRC total about 91 million people and consist of about\n55 ethnic groups. They are located primarily in three provinces in the southwest, i.e. Yunnan,\nGuizhou and Guangxi-Zhuang. These provinces are underdeveloped and poor, compared with\nthe rapidly developing central and coastal regions of the country. The disadvantaged position\nof the three provinces is illustrated by the following socioeconomic indicators: (i) about half of\nthe prefectures in each province have an annual income of $53 (in 1991 prices) compared\nwith the national average of $370; (ii) about 50 per cent of the rural population is\nunderemployed; (iii) the average land holding per family of 0.4 hectare (ha) is very small; (iv)\nthe level of literacy (about 60 per cent) is lower than national average; (v) about half of the rural\ncommunities do not have easy access to roads and transport services; (vi) most communities\ndo not have potable water supply, electricity, schools, and health services; and (vi) the existing\nrural industries (e.g. marble and sugar processing) lack appropriate machinery and\ninfrastructure.\n3. In the 1980s the Government initiated a nationwide poverty-reduction program.\nAlthough the program made some progress in channelling development resources to the\ninterior provinces, it was ineffective in addressing the disparities in economic growth between\nthese provinces and the more developed coastal ones. Furthermore, market reforms and price\nadjustments introduced during this period exacerbated the regional disparities by benefitting\nprimarily the coastal provinces. Provinces such as those in the southwest also lack private\ninvestment because of their remote location and poorly developed road and market network.\n4. In recognition of the situation, the Government's Eighth (1991-1995) Five Year\nPlan included a program to provide more development resources to disadvantaged provinces.\nIn response, the Bank approved an advisory TA in 1990 to develop a rural development\nTA No. 1356-PRC: Integrated Rural Development of Selected Provinces in Southwest\nChina, for $597,000, approved on 17 August 1990.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in August 1992.\n-\t\nA prefecture is an administrative subdivision of a province. Prefectures are composed\nof a number of counties.", "2\nstrategy for the three southwest provinces. The advisory TA recommended using an integrated\napproach to address the multiple factors related to poverty in that region -- depleted natural\nresources, limited access to basic social, credit and marketing services, inappropriate land use,\nlow agricultural productivity, poor education and skills, and limited nonagricultural employment\nopportunities.\n5. The advisory TA recommended a ten-year development program to address\ndirectly the needs of the different poverty groups in the three provinces. The program is aimed\nat increasing income-generation opportunities and improving access to basic social services.\nIt comprises 160 project proposals generated from consultations with the target communities\nand the concerned government agencies in selected counties in the three provinces. The\nproposals range from incomegenerating activities such as cash crop production, agro-\nprocessing, tree planting and small-scale enterprises, to construction of simple water-\ncatchment units for household use, irrigation systems, roads and small reservoirs.\n6. The implementation strategy would be to encourage local communities to select\nfrom the list of project proposals, a package of activities suited to local conditions and their\npreferences. Each package of activities would be financed as a discrete \"Community Project'\n(CP). Each CP would be implemented in an integrated fashion to achieve a synergistic impact\non the community as a whole. Specifically, the activities would concentrate on improvement\nin five areas:\n(i) increase access to basic social services for all households in the community;\n(ii) generate economically and environmentally sustainable increases in\nagricultural productivity;\n(iii) stabilize and conserve the natural resource base (forest, water and soil\nresources);\n(iv) increase rural enterprise options; and\n(v) build appropriate infrastructure to support (ii) and (iv).\n7. Using this strategy, the State Nationalities Affairs Commission (SNAC), the\nExecuting Agency has implemented 18 pilot CPs in the three provinces. SNAC acted as the\ncoordinator among the different local government bureaus to channel technical services to the\nproject sites. Funds for the pilot activities have been raised through beneficiary contributions,\nloans from the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), leases in-kind, subsidies from the local\ngovernments and, in some cases, service charges on farmers. All the projects are currently\nstill under implementation and are demonstrating encouraging results. Nonetheless, being\nsmall pilot efforts, the impact of the 18 pilot CPs has been limited to benefitting a small number\nof families at each project site rather than whole communities. The Mission and the\nGovernment agreed that a larger, more focussed investment project would be required to\nincrease beneficiary coverage and simulate economic growth at a level that would generate\nmore widespread effects.", "3\nB.\t Rationale\n8. Since the Government's experience and institutional capability is limited, it needs\ntechnical assistance to design a larger investment project along the lines recommended by the\nadvisory TA. Detailed economic, financial, social, institutional and environmental impact\nanalyses will be required to appraise the feasibility, investment potential, financing\nrequirements and potential poverty-reduction impact of the program.\n9. From a broader perspective, the TA is justified because: (i) the investment\nproposal that will result from the TA will be the Bank's first involvement in support of a poverty\nreduction program focussing on the more remote and poorer provinces in the PRC, and could\nprovide the basis for encouraging support from other aid agencies; (ii) the approaches\ndeveloped could be applied to other Bank DMCs; and (iii) SNAC, the designated Executing\nAgency has demonstrated its commitment and competence in establishing and implementing\npilot activities and is seeking assistance to strengthen its institutional capacity for formulating\na larger development program. Being poverty-oriented and targeted on the undeveloped\nprovinces, the TA is also consistent with the Bank's medium-term development priorities and\ncountry operational strategy for the PRO.\nIll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective and Scope\n10. The objective of the TA is to assist the Government in designing an investment\nproject to support about 40 CPs benefiting poor rural communities in the provinces of Yunnan,\nGuizhou and Guangxi-Zhuang. The TA would: (i) develop criteria for selecting CPs that will\nmeet the objectives of the development program formulated under the advisory TA and are\nthemselves economically, environmentally and socially sound; (ii) develop a financing plan\ndelineating funding requirements from Government and external sources; (iii) recommend\nmeasures that would ensure the self-sustainability of the community projects; (iv) develop\nappropriate implementation and financing arrangements with respect to the roles of the\ndifferent levels of Government and beneficiary communities; and (v) if necessary, propose a\ntraining program for relevant government agencies and communities.\nB.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11 The Executing Agency will be the State Nationalities Affairs Commission (SNAC)\nof the PRO. SNAC will be responsible for the general administration and coordination of the\nTA with central and local government agencies. The provincial governments of Yunnan,\nGuizhou and Guangxi-Zhuang will work as the Implementing Agencies and assist SNAC in\nconducting field studies. SNAC will appoint a senior level officer who will act as the\ncounterpart Project Director for the TA. Each Implementing Agency will appoint a project\nmanager in consultation with the Executing Agency. Project offices will be established in\nBeijing and each province. SNAC and the Implementing Agencies will assign counterpart\nprofessional and supporting staff (interpreters, secretaries and drivers) to assist the consultants\nand will provide suitable office space and amenities.\nFIre\t I\t I\t ?rl,,vrII,\t +-\t ..", "4\n12. The TA will be undertaken over a period of five months by an international\nconsulting firm or educational/research institution, to be recruited by the Bank in accordance\nwith the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The firm or institution will be\nresponsible for recruiting a team of 4 international and 21 local consultants with appropriate\nqualifications to undertake the tasks as described in the terms of reference in Appendix 1!\".\nThe Executing Agency will provide a list of suitable local consultants prior to issuing invitations\nto bid, although it is understood that the consulting firms may select individual local\nconsultants who are not on the list. The total services provided by the international consultants\nwill amount to 12 person-months. A total of 45 person-months will be provided by the local\nconsultants.\n13. The consultant team, in cooperation with the counterpart staff from SNAC and\nthe Implementing Agencies will submit an inception report at the end of the first month of the\nTA and a draft final report at the beginning of the fifth month. A tripartite meeting will be\nconvened to discuss the draft final report. The final report incorporating comments from the\nGovernment and the Bank will be submitted before the end of the fifth month.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n14. The total cost of the TA is $644,000, of which the foreign exchange cost and\nlocal currency cost are $364,000 and $280,000, respectively. The entire foreign exchange cost\nand $186,000 equivalent of local currency cost will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis\nfrom the Japan Special Fund. The Government will provide the remainder of the local currency\ncost. The major items are the costs for international and local consultants including\nremuneration, per diem, travel, communications and reporting. To facilitate field work in the\nthree provinces, two vehicles will be procured. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan\nis in Appendix 2.\n15. The total cost of the proposed project is currently estimated at $40-50 million.\nThe foreign currency requirements will be determined during the course of the TA. The\nGovernment has been informed that approval of this TA does not necessarily commit the Bank\nto finance any project that may result from this TA.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n16. It is considered that the proposed TA to the Government of the People's\nRepublic of China is necessary for the purpose of the Integrated Rural Development for\nMinority Areas Project. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the\nBoard, has approved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in the amount not\nexceeding the equivalent of $ 550,000. The President hereby reports his action to the Board.\nAll consultants will be recruited in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.", "5\t Appendix 1\nPage 1\nDETAILED TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES\nA.\t General\nUnder the technical assistance (TA), a team of consultants (the team) will assist the\nExecuting Agency i.e. the State Nationality Affairs Commission (SNAC) of the People's Republic\nof China (the PRC) in designing an investment project, Integrated Rural Development for\nMinority Areas (the Project). The Project is expected to be the first phase of a large investment\nprogram to support community-level initiatives aimed at increasing income-generation\nopportunities for, and improving living conditions of, the rural poor, particularly ethnic minorities\nin the southwest region. The Project design will be based on findings and recommendations\nof the preceding advisory TA1' for the Project, the achievements of pilot activities being\nimplemented by SNAC, and discussions with SNAC and other relevant government agencies\nand beneficiaries.\nThe Project will support about 40 community projects (CPs), each comprising a\npackage of activities designed for the following purposes: (i) increase access to basic social\nservices; (ii) generate economically and environmentally sustainable increases in agricultural\nproductivity; (iii) address site-specific environmental and natural resource degradation\nproblems; and (iv) increase rural enterprise employment opportunities and build appropriate\ninfrastructure to support (ii) and (iv).\nThe consultant team will undertake two main tasks. First, the team will develop criteria\nfor selecting 40 CPs in the three target provinces that will meet the Project's objectives and\nbeneficiaries' preferences. Based on the selection criteria developed and in consultation with\nSNAC and Implementing Agencies (lAs), the team will identify about 40 CPs to be covered by\nthe Project. Second, the team will formulate the Project design, encompassing the selected\nCPs, a financing plan delineating funding from government and external sources, and\nappropriate implementation and financing arrangements with all relevant implementation\nagencies (IA) at each level of the government (central, provincial, prefectural and county) and\nwith groups representing the beneficiaries (womens' groups, farmer organizations, water-users\nassociations, etc.). If necessary, the Project design should include a training component for\nrelevant government personnel and farmer groups and to increase the absorptive capacity of\nbeneficiary communities for externally financed activities.\nThe team will be responsible for all feasibility studies necessary to appraise the\neconomic, financial, institutional, social and environmental soundness of the CPs and the\nProject as a whole. The team shall review ongoing pilot activities initiated by SNAC, with\nrespect to the selection criteria applied, major implementation issues encountered, financing\nand managing arrangements and possibilities of enlarging their scope and coverage. The\nGovernment will provide logistical and secretarial support and relevant information from\nsecondary sources.\nTA No. 1356-PRC: Integrated Rural Development of Selected Provinces in Southwest\nChina, for $597,000, approved on 17 August 1990.\n(Reference in text: page 4, para. 12)", "6\t\nAppendix 1\nPage 2\nThe consultant team will comprise 4 international consultants with appropriate\nexpertise in, but not limited to, rural development, economic and financial analysis, social\nsoundness analysis, and environmental impact assessment.
