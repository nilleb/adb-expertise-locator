THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Hubei  Huanggang  Urban  Environment \nImprovement Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  aims  to  promote  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially  inclusive \nurbanization in Huanggang, Hubei Province by improving the urban environment. The project \nwill improve the lakes and rivers\u2019 water quality, flood-retention capacity, and aesthetic value \ncontributing to economic prosperity and enhanced livability in the lakeside urban area.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Huanggang is located on the north bank of the middle reach of the Yangtze River in \neastern Hubei Province, 78 kilometers (km) from the provincial capital, Wuhan.3 Building on a \nrural-based economy, Huanggang is one of the poorest municipalities in the province and has a \nrelatively low urbanization rate of 35.7%.4 The Huanggang municipal government (HMG) in its \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 targets to transform its economic structure and facilitate \nurbanization with expanded secondary and tertiary industries. Huanggang is well positioned to \ntake advantage of national and regional development plans due to its proximity to Wuhan; good \nconnectivity  with  neighboring  cities  and  provinces;  and  rich  historic,  cultural,  and  human \nresources.5 Huanggang has the potential to play a strategic role in facilitating socioeconomic \ndevelopment in the central region of the PRC. This is envisaged under the national plan.6 \nFurthermore,  Huanggang  is  part  of  the  Wuhan  1+8  megacity  cluster,  which  the  PRC \ngovernment endorsed as a pilot for balanced regional development in the province.7 \n \n4.  Huanggang  is  on  a  floodplain,  with  many  lakes  and  rivers.  Protecting  the  water \nenvironment and controlling water pollution in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze \nRiver, the largest of the seven river basins in the PRC and also the source of a high amount of \nwastewater,  is  a  key  government  strategy.  One  of  the  urban  development  constraints  of \nHuanggang is the deteriorating water quality in lakes and rivers, which are silted and blocked \nwith polluted sediments, hindering natural hydraulic circulation,  further  degrading  the  water \nenvironment  and  ecology,  weakening  resilience  to  floods  and  droughts,  and  adversely \naffecting public health and safety. Huanggang\u2019s three major urban lakes\u2014Baitan, Chiye, and \n                                                      \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2012. Technical \nAssistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing the Hubei Huanggang Integrated Urban Environment \nImprovement Project. Manila (TA 8151-PRC). \n3  As  the second  most  populated municipality  in  Hubei  Province,  Huanggang,  with  its  7.46 million  residents, \ncomprises one district (Huangzhou), two county-level cities, seven counties, and a county-level farm.  \n4  Almost 20.0% (1.50 million) of Huanggang\u2019s total municipal population is poor and most live in rural areas. \nAccording to the Hubei Poverty Alleviation Office, rural poverty incidence in Huanggang is estimated at 25.2% in \n2012, which is higher than the provincial average rate of 20.2% and the national average of 13.4%. Rural poverty \nincidence in Huangzhou District is 21.5%, urban poverty incidence is 8.1%. The Hubei Annual Socio-economic \nDevelopment Report (2012) estimates Wuhan\u2019s per capita gross domestic product in 2012 at about CNY79,878, \nwhile that of Huanggang at about CNY19,208, the second lowest among 17 municipalities in Hubei Province. \n5  Huanggang  is  connected  to  Beijing,  Shanghai,  Guangzhou,  and  Hong  Kong  with  railways,  extensive  road \nnetworks, and several expressways. The Wuhan intercity high-speed railway merges Huanggang \u201cwithin-30-\nminute-economic circle\u201d of Wuhan. \n6  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2004. The Rise of Central China Plan. Beijing. \n7  The Wuhan  1+8  megacity  cluster  involves Wuhan;  together  with  the  municipalities  of  Ezhou,  Huanggang, \nHuangshi, Qianjiang, Tianmen, Xianning, Xiantao, and Xiaogan in Hubei Province. ", "2 \nYiai\u2014are severely polluted with organic matter and nutrients. Much of the surface water quality \nis currently measured as class V or worse.8 Realizing the importance of improving water quality \nfor the city\u2019s sustainable development, HMG has made plans and increased investments to \ncontrol pollution at the source and to improve the environment.9 To date, HMG investment has \nfocused on improving water quality in Yiai Lake in the existing urban area, leaving other lakes \nand rivers unattended. \n \n5.  Limited  urban  space  also  constrains  the  development  potential  of  Huanggang.  The \nexisting  central  urban  area  in  Huangzhou  District  is  dense  and  inadequate  for  increasing \neconomic  activities.10 Limited  urban space and inadequate urban infrastructure has slowed \neconomic  development  and  delayed  the  urbanization  process,  resulting  in  Huanggang \nbecoming  sidelined  from  mainstream  developments  in  the  province.  To  address  this \nconstraint, the approved Huanggang Municipal Urban Master Plan, 2012\u25002030 provides for \neastward urban expansion by developing the New Eastern District (NED) with adequate urban \nspace,  infrastructure,  and  services;  and  an  environment-friendly  and  socioeconomically \ninclusive setting to support sustainable urban development and rural\u2013urban transition.11 \n \n6.  Baitan and Chiye lakes and seven associated rivers are in the center of NED, where \nHMG\u2019s pollution control interventions have not  yet  reached. Nutrient-laden sediments from \nagricultural  and  fish  farming  have  reached  levels  that  affect  the  lakes\u2019  water  quality  and \nhydraulic retention capacity. The seven rivers are blocked due to sediments from erosion of \nunlined banks reducing their drainage capacity. The increased urban development will create \nmore impervious surfaces, resulting in an increase in surface water runoff.12 HMG is currently \nimproving  point  source  pollution  control  in  NED. 13  The  project  will  complement  these \ninterventions, focusing primarily on nonpoint source pollution control. It will adopt an integrated \napproach to water quality and retention capacity enhancements of the lakes and associated \nrivers by removing contaminated sediments, constructing wetlands, stabilizing lakes and rivers \nembankments, and improving hydraulic recirculation. As a result, water quality of Baitan and \nChiye lakes will improve from class V to class IV, flood protection will increase, and the \nlakeside aesthetic and amenity value and health benefit will significantly rise.14 \n \n7.  Lessons learned. Project design incorporates lessons from Yiai Lake rehabilitation, a \nrecent locally funded initiative, and other Asian Development Bank (ADB)-supported lake and \n                                                      \n8  Class I water has the highest quality and class V+ water is the worst. Class IV is suitable for use as a general \nindustrial water supply and for recreational use involving no direct human contact with the water, class V is suitable \nonly for agricultural water supply and general landscaping use, and class V+ is unsuitable for any use (PRC \nEnvironmental Quality Standards for Surface Water, GB 3838-2002). \n9  Hubei  Provincial  Water  Resources  Bureau.  2010.

Huanggang. \n10 As of 2010, urban residents of Huangzhou District (about 73% of the total district population of 367,000) live in a \nbuilt-up area of approximately 31 square kilometers, indicating high density. With the enhanced living environment \nand economic opportunities, and regional development, the population is expected to grow up to 2030. \n11 Huanggang Municipal Government. 2013.

Huanggang. \n12 Impervious surfaces are artificial surfaces covered by impenetrable materials such as asphalt, concrete, brick, or \nstone. \n13 PRC national urban wastewater tariff guidelines for wastewater management and cost recovery will be followed. \nHMG has relocated four out of nine industrial plants outside the NED phase 1 area (Baitan Lake planning area), the \nremaining five will be relocated by 2020. Capacity expansion of Nanhu wastewater treatment plant, located near  \nNED, and associated sewage network will cover the NED phase 1 area and its surroundings. \n14 The lakes\u2019 retention capacity and rivers\u2019 hydraulic carrying capacity that reduces the return period of seasonal \nflooding in NED will increase from 5 years to 20 years. \n ", "3 \nriver restoration projects in the PRC.15 The project design incorporates best international \npractices: (i) the need to take an integrated approach to water system rehabilitation, and (ii) \nthe importance of using simulation techniques to predict likely outcomes.16 \n \n8.  Special features and value addition. The project is not a stand-alone investment but \nplays  an  integral  part  of  the  Huanggang  Municipal  Urban  Master  Plan  by  significantly \nimproving water quality in Baitan and Chiye lakes. The capacity building and institutional \nstrengthening component will add value to the implementation of the master plan. As part of \nthe  project\u2019s  capacity  development  component,  a  water  quality  monitoring  and  forecasting \nsystem for the upstream Xingfu River catchment and Baitan and Chiye lakes will be developed \nand used by the Huanggang environment protection authorities for systematic and continuing \nwater quality management. The system, which will be based on the hydraulic and water quality \nmodel  developed  during  project  preparation,  has  great  replication  potential.  It  can  be \ndisseminated as a good practice in sustainable pollution control and ecological preservation \napplicable to polluted and blocked urban lakes in small and medium-sized cities along the \nYangtze River, and elsewhere in the PRC. \n \n9.  The project will complement past and ongoing projects that are contributing to reducing \npollution  in  the  Yangtze  River.17 Since  the  drinking  water  intakes  of  several  cities  are \ndownstream from the Yangtze River, the project also contributes to the protection of the vital \ndrinking  water  source.  The  project  supports  environmentally  sustainable  and  inclusive \neconomic growth that is a priority of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.18 The project \naligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC; ADB Urban Operational \nPlan, 2012\u20132020; the Green Cities initiative; and ADB Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020, \nwhich encourages integrated water resources management particularly in river basins.19 It will \nsupport  economically  and  socially  inclusive  urbanization  and  rural\u2013urban  transition  in \nHuanggang and contribute to balanced regional development in the PRC and in Hubei Province, \nthereby supporting the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. The project builds on ADB\u2019s \nexperience from urban projects in Hubei Province and in the PRC. 20 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  project  impact  will  be  socially  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable \nurbanization  in Huanggang. The project  outcome will be an improved  urban  environment in \nHuanggang. \n \n \n                                                      \n15 These include (i) Wuhan\u2019s water quality model to predict water quality in lakes and rivers, and (ii) Nanjing\u2019s \nrehabilitated rivers and created wetlands.

Manila. \n16 In the context of urban lake and river enhancement, the social and economic requirements of adjacent urban \nareas are of major importance. Flood safety and quality of life in proximity of urban lakes and rivers have to be \nconsidered along with the ecological and chemical state of water bodies. \n17 ADB projects in Huangshi, Jiujiang, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Wuhan are contributing to pollution reduction in the \nYangtze River. \n18 ADB. 2014.

The project will have three outputs: urban lake and river enhancement, solid waste \nmanagement, and capacity development and institutional strengthening. \n \n12.  Urban lake and river enhancement. The lake enhancement component will (i) remove \n539,000  cubic  meters  (m3)  of  nutrient-laden  sediments  from  Baitan  and  Chiye  lakes,  \n(ii)  construct  14  km  of  ecological  flood-retention  embankments  with  89  hectares  (ha)  of \nvegetated buffer strips, (iii) create 80 ha of surface-flow constructed wetland for Chiye Lake,  \n(iv) establish four subsurface-flow constructed wetlands with total area of 3.8 ha and detention \nbasins for Baitan and Chiye lakes to treat nonpoint source pollution, (v) construct 13.3 km of \nmultiuse nonmotorized pathway along the lakeshore with nine bridges across the rivers, and  \n(vi) construct and upgrade two sluice gates. The river enhancement component will (i) remove \nabout 201,000 m3 of nutrient-laden sediments and excavate and/or widen the river course to \nreestablish natural connections between lakes and rivers; and (ii) construct about 21.6 km of \nflood-retention ecological embankments with 42.6 ha of vegetated buffer strips and sidewalks. \n \n13.  Solid waste management. To contribute to improved solid waste collection and transfer \nin the lakeside area, the project will (i) construct one transfer station (30 tons per day) and \nprovide 260 waste bins around the lakes; (ii) purchase two garbage trucks; and (iii) implement a \npublic awareness campaign on solid waste sorting, recycling, and environmental protection. \n \n14.  Capacity development and institutional strengthening. The project will (i) implement \nand monitor support to executing and implementing agencies to implement and monitor the \nproject in line with ADB procedures and guidelines; and (ii) provide capacity and institutional \nstrengthening for HMG on wetlands operation and management, water quality monitoring and \nforecasting including nonpoint source pollution control, and lake ecology and biodiversity. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $252.6 million (Table 1).21 \n \n16.  The government  has requested  a  loan  of $100  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  a  straight-line  repayment  option,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements.22 Based on this, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years and the \nmaturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. The loan will finance 39.6% of the \nproject cost, including works, goods, and institutional strengthening. The loan will also finance \ntaxes  and  duties  for  eligible  ADB-financed  expenditures,  and  transportation  and  insurance \ncosts. HMG will provide counterpart funding, equivalent to $71.3 million, from its budget to \nfinance 28.2% of the project cost. The implementing agency, Huanggang Urban Construction \nInvestment Company (HUCIC), has requested a loan of about $81.3 million from a domestic \nbank for the remaining counterpart funds to cover 32.2% of the project cost, and has received a \ncommitment letter from the domestic bank. \n \n                                                      \n21 Detailed cost estimates are in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n22 Interest and other charges during construction will not be capitalized in the loan and will be financed by HMG. \n ", "5 \n17.  The PRC is the borrower of the loan. The PRC will relend the entire loan to the Hubei \nprovincial government, which will onlend the loan proceeds to HMG on the same terms and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan. As the end-borrower, HMG will assume foreign exchange \nand interest rate variation risks for the ADB loan. The PRC, Hubei provincial government, and \nHMG have assured ADB that counterpart funding and domestic bank loan proceeds will be \nprovided in a timely manner, including any additional counterpart funding required for any \nshortfall of funds or cost overruns.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n19.  The technical aspects of the project are consistent with the PRC design guidelines and \nlocal  regulations.  Lake  rehabilitation  is  well  integrated  and  sequenced  with  other  project \ncomponents. Analysis based on eight scenarios that simulate water quality of Baitan and Chiye \nlakes and seven associated rivers identifies the appropriate amount and location of dredging, \nsize and location of surface-flow, and subsurface-flow constructed wetlands and vegetation. The \nsediment  dredging  plans  are  in  line  with  international  best  practices;  the  wetland  designs \naccount for type, amount, and location of future pollution sources; and engineering designs are \ntechnically sound and compatible with the water quality target for lakes of class IV or better. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  Economic. The economic rationale rests on the need to improve the environment by \ncleaning up local lakes and rivers. Even if economic growth could be forecast, the benefits \ncannot be separately attributed to lake and river cleanup (i.e., the project) and other planned \nHMG interventions. The economic justification relies primarily on the strength of the project \nrationale and cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative approaches to improve water quality. \nUsing scenario-based planning and identifying a least-cost approach to optimize project design, \n ", "7 \nthe impact of eight different scenarios on water quality was simulated, and then least-cost \nanalysis was applied to the three design options that meet the water quality objectives and the \nproject\u2019s  technical  requirements.  Engineering  measures  that  are  least  cost  and  technically \nsuitable are incorporated in the project design.23 \n \n21.  Financial. The project does not have any revenue-generating components. The financial \nanalysis, therefore, focuses on the ability of the end borrower, HMG, to service project debts \nand provide counterpart funds. ADB loan funds will be channeled to the project via the Hubei \nProvincial Finance Department to HMG. In addition, HMG has provided assurances on the \navailability of counterpart funds and for all project recurrent expenses. Based on the fiscal \nimpact of the project on HMG finances, a financial sustainability analysis was undertaken. The \nanalysis shows that HMG\u2019s commitment to the project during implementation (2014\u20132019) will \nrange from 2.2% of its revenues (excluding one-off receipts) in 2014 to 0.8% in 2019. This \ncommitment will rise in 2020 to an estimated 1.7% as debt repayment commences, but will fall \nin 2021 to 1.5% and continue to decline thereafter.24 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n22.  Financial management. The project will be ADB\u2019s first loan to Huanggang, which has \nlimited  experience  in  managing  multilateral-financed  projects.  The  financial  management \nassessment focuses on HMG as the end borrower and on HUCIC as the implementing agency. \nThe assessment indicates that HMG has generally adequate financial management capacity to \nassume  its  core  role  for  financial  management  supervision  of  the  project.  The  HUCIC \nassessment concludes that HUCIC can achieve adequate capacity for financial management in \naccordance  with  ADB  policies  and  procedural  requirements,  with  provision  of  appropriate \ncapacity-building  support  and  recruitment  of  at  least  one  suitably  qualified  financial  staff \nmember. The assessments are described in the financial analysis (footnote 24). \n \n23.  Procurement capacity. As HUCIC will undertake procurement of goods and works and \nthe Huanggang project management office (HPMO) will undertake procurement of consulting \nservices, both agencies were subjected to a procurement capacity assessment. As this is the \nfirst ADB project for HPMO and HUCIC, a procurement agent experienced in ADB policies and \nprocedures will be appointed to advise both organizations. HUCIC has a department with a 6-\nyear track record of successful domestic procurement. One staff member with 10 years of \nprocurement  experience  has  been  assigned  to  HPMO  to  work  with  the  HUCIC  project \nimplementation  unit  on  procurement;  this  is  considered  acceptable.  The  project  capacity-\nbuilding component includes the provision of governance training and advice to HPMO and \nHUCIC on ADB procedures. The Wuhan project management office is sharing lessons from its \nexperience  in  implementing  three  ADB  projects  with  HPMO  and  HUCIC.  Improvements \nrecommended  in  the  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  assessments  are \nincorporated in the project design and documented in the PAM. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Hubei  provincial \ngovernment,  HMG,  HPMO,  and  HUCIC.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n24.  The project is focused on improving the urban environment to enable the development of \n                                                      \n23 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nindustry, services, and employment; and is designed to ensure that economic opportunity and \ninclusion underlie the process of urbanization. The 41,600 residents of the project area in \nHuangzhou  District  are  the  primary  project  beneficiaries.  When  phase  1  of  NED  is  fully \ndeveloped  by  2020,  the  project  will  directly  benefit  100,000  residents  and  industries  and \nservices in the area through improved water quality of urban surface waters, public amenity \nspace  to  enhance  quality  of  life  of  the  people  living  in  the  project  area,  and  enhanced \ninvestment environment and employment in Huanggang. Indirect beneficiaries are the 367,000 \nresidents in Huangzhou District. The poverty and social assessment includes a household \nsurvey, community and focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The project will \nfacilitate NED development where low-cost rental housing and job opportunities will be provided \nto help create socially inclusive communities. The project will directly create 2,450 jobs during \nconstruction,  133  jobs  during  operation,  and  significant  indirect  job  opportunities  that  are \nexpected to arise as a consequence of NED development. Employment targets for vulnerable \ngroups and women are included in the design and monitoring framework and loan covenants. A \nsocial action plan was prepared and will be implemented by HMG.25 \n \n25.  Gender. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender \naction  plan  was  prepared  with  agreed  activities  and  indicators.  Survey  and  focus  group \ndiscussion  data  reveal  that  women  are  generally  burdened  with  family  and  household \nresponsibilities and are employed in low-paying jobs. The improved urban environment will \nprovide safe, clean, and accessible recreational areas for women and children. It will benefit \nwomen by improving the living environment and quality of life, and increasing women\u2019s job \nopportunities. Women\u2019s participation in public awareness activities on solid waste management \nand public health will support project sustainability. The gender action plan includes targets for \nwomen\u2019s employment, participation, and capacity building supported by loan covenants and \nconsulting support for implementation and monitoring.26 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  Environment. The project is environment category A, reflecting the urban lake and river \nenhancement  with  significant  earthwork  and  sediment  dredging.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment, including an environmental management plan (EMP), was drafted and disclosed \non the ADB website on 20 January 2014. The project will generate environmental benefits:  \n(i) about 1,920 tons of total nitrogen and 486 tons of total phosphorus will be removed from the \nproject lakes through dredging; (ii) the constructed wetlands will remove 171 tons of chemical \noxygen demand, 49 tons of total nitrogen, and 1.1 tons of total phosphorus each year from the \nproject lakes and subsequently the Yangtze River; and (iii) the wetlands will provide breeding, \nfeeding,  nesting,  and  resting  habitats  for  wildlife  including  migratory  water  birds.  The \nenvironmental impact assessment confirms that the climate change risk to project activities is \nlow.  Precipitation  in the  project  area  is  unlikely  to  change  and  average runoff  will  slightly \ndecrease. The project's resilience to predicted increases in climate variability (precipitation and \nrunoff) will be strengthened through improved hydraulic retention and carrying capacity of urban \nlakes and rivers. This was confirmed through hydraulic modeling of the Baitan Lake water level \nunder a climate change scenario with increased precipitation intensity. Project construction has \npotential impacts on the environment. Dust and noise generated by construction activities will be \na nuisance to nearby residents. Discharge of supernatant water from the dredged sediment \ndisposal sites could potentially pollute nearby water bodies. Dredging will stir up the sediment, \n                                                      \n25 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The \nsocial action plan is included in the PAM. \n26 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nreleasing suspended solids and nutrients into the water column affecting water quality and \necology.  No  significant  impact  is  expected  during  operation.  HMG  is  increasing  existing \nwastewater and solid waste collection and treatment capacity within NED to accommodate \nfuture needs and ensure adequate point source pollution control. The impact of the sluice gates \non fish migration will not be significant.27 The solid waste transfer station and the project-\nassociated water diversion pumping stations may induce minor noise and odor impacts. All \nimpacts are expected to be prevented or minimized to an acceptable level through effective \nimplementation  of  the  EMP.  HPMO  and  HUCIC  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementing, supervising, monitoring, and reporting on the EMP and will appoint full-time staff \nto coordinate  and monitor  EMP  implementation.  Environment  and  wetland  experts  and  an \nornithologist  will  support  the  work.  HPMO  will  also  hire  an  external  environment  monitor. \nAffected  persons  and  stakeholders  were  consulted  during  the  environmental  impact \nassessment. The EMP includes a grievance redress mechanism, which was discussed and \nagreed upon with HPMO and HUCIC. \n \n27.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is resettlement category A. It will affect eight \nvillages or communities in the project area. A total of 9,477.7 mu of land will be occupied \npermanently, including 798.6 mu of collective land and 8,679.1 mu of state-owned land.28 A total \nof 77.5 mu of land will be occupied temporarily and a total of 4,736.5 square meters (m2) of \nresidential housing and 11,038 m2 of nonresidential building will be demolished. Land acquisition \nwill affect 318 households, entities, and/or stores with 1,140 persons physically displaced, and 42 \nhouseholds with 184 persons temporarily affected, totaling 360 households with 1,324 persons \naffected.29 A resettlement plan and a due diligence report were prepared in line with ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and endorsed by HMG. The plan was disclosed to the \naffected persons and uploaded on the ADB website on 17 March 2014. Compensation for lost \nassets  and  resettlement  allowances  will  be  paid  to  those  affected.  Livelihood  rehabilitation \narrangements  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  plan  should  be  made  prior  to  the \ncommencement of the related civil works. HPMO and HUCIC will assume responsibility for \nplanning,  implementing,  financing,  and  reporting  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  A \ngrievance redress mechanism was established. An external resettlement and social monitor will \nbe engaged to conduct semiannual monitoring and evaluation of resettlement implementation. \n \n28.  Indigenous  peoples. The  project  is  indigenous  peoples  category  C.  In  Huangzhou \nDistrict, ethnic minorities represent about 0.25% of the total registered population.30 The main \nethnic minorities in the district are Hui, Miao, Tujia, and Zhuang who are integrated into urban \ncommunities. The project area does not have any concentration of ethnic minorities and the \nproject will not have any negative effect on any ethnic minority people. No ethnic minorities are \naffected by land acquisition and resettlement. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  The  project  has  no  unusual  technical  risks.  The  project\u2019s  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh costs and risks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \n                                                      \n27 Two sluice gates will be constructed to prevent the backflow of Santai River water into Baitan Lake when the \nSantai River water level is higher than that of Baitan Lake. \n28 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.7 square meters). \n29 In which 129 households with 408 persons will be affected by land acquisition of collective land, 187 households \nwith 727 people will be affected by land occupation of state-owned land, 22 households with 79 people will be \naffected by residential house demolition (also affected by land acquisition), and 2 entities with 5 people will be \naffected by nonresidential building demolition. \n30 The Sixth National Population Census (2010) indicates that Huangzhou District has a minority population of 924. \n ", "10 \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nHPMO and HUCIC lack experience in  Engage start-up consultants to provide technical support for land acquisition \nimplementing ADB-financed projects,  and resettlement, procurement, contract management, disbursement, and \nresulting in delay in procurement,  financial management. \ndisbursement, and construction  The project implementation consultants will provide training on ADB \nguidelines and procedures. \nLand acquisition approvals and  Promptly implement detailed design and measurement surveys, and finalize \nimplementation are delayed  the resettlement plan. \nEnsure early availability of compensation funds to affected people, and strict \ncompliance with the resettlement plan. \nProvide consulting support at all stages. \nDelays in the provision of counterpart  HMFB and the domestic bank will issue commitment letters.  \nfunding  HMG is providing assurance for timely provision of counterpart funding. \nA backup source of funding will be discussed during implementation. \nUnsustainable O&M of infrastructure  Project implementation consultants will provide capacity building and \ncomponents due to lack of capacity  institutional strengthening support for O&M agencies, especially for wetland \nand budget  management. \nHMG is providing assurances on O&M budget provision. \nLow procurement capacity leads to  Project implementation consultants and tendering company will provide \nmistakes or delays in the  support and training in project management and planning. \nprocurement process  Use of advance procurement action is appropriate. \nStandard bidding documents will be used. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, HMFB = Huanggang Municipal Finance Bureau, HMG = Huanggang municipal \ngovernment, HPMO = Huanggang project management office, HUCIC = Huanggang Urban Construction Investment \nCompany, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIV.
