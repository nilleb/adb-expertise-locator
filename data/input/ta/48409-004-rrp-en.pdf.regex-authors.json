THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Climate-Friendly Agribusiness Value \nChains Sector Project. \n2.  The  proposed  project  supports  the  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s  Agriculture \nDevelopment Strategy to 2025 (ADS) by boosting the competitiveness of rice value chains in \nKhammouane, Saravan, and Savannakhet provinces, and vegetable value chains in Vientiane \nCapital, Champasak, and Sekong provinces.1 The project will improve the climate resilience of \nagricultural infrastructure, and enhance crop productivity, diversification, and commercialization. \nIt will help improve the capacity for storage, processing, quality, and safety testing, and promote \nthe use of biofertilizers and organic farming. It will strengthen the capacity of farmers and \nagribusinesses for climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and create an enabling environment for \nclimate-friendly agribusinesses to promote sustainability along the value chain. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sector performance. The Human Development Index report ranks the Lao PDR as 138th \nout of 188 countries.2 Macroeconomic and political stability enabled it to achieve moderate \neconomic growth at 6.5% per annum during 1986\u22122016.3 However, the country also grappled \nwith a persistent current account deficit, falling foreign currency reserves, and growing public debt. \nAlthough the contribution of agriculture to the national gross domestic product is declining (from \n32.7% in 2010 to 19.8% in 2016), the economy still remains agrarian: about 65% of the working \npopulation is employed in the sector. Low sector growth led to low levels of rural household \nincomes. The poverty rate of those engaged in agriculture is nearly three times higher than for \nthose working in other sectors (footnote 3). \n4.  Development challenges. Various physical, environmental, socioeconomic, and capacity \nbarriers constrain sector productivity and profitability, notably poor infrastructure, low technical \ncapacity, and unfavorable policies.4 Farming remains mostly subsistence and rain-fed. Although \n3.8 million hectares are potentially suitable for cultivation, the irrigated area is limited to 0.3 million \nhectares as of 2016 (footnote 3). Access roads to rural markets and logistics infrastructure are of \nlow quality, contributing to high distribution costs. About 90% of the paddy in the country are milled \nin small processing units with old and obsolete equipment. Limited availability of climate-resilient \nvarieties, low capacity of farmers for adopting climate-friendly practices and technologies, and \nlimited access for smallholder farmers  to affordable credit also hamper the transition from \nsubsistence farming to commercial agriculture. The steady migration of young people to urban \nareas left behind an aging and declining labor force, yet farm mechanization remains limited. \n5.  A policy environment characterized by onerous registration requirements, a gap between \nlegislation and implementation, and conflicting regulations are key barriers for agribusiness. \n                                                \n1  Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. 2015. Agriculture Development Strategy to 2025 \nand Vision to the Year 2030. Vientiane. Target provinces and commodities were selected based on agribusiness \npotential, inclusiveness, climate vulnerability, and government priorities. \n2  United Nations Development Programme. 2017. United Nations Human Development Report 2017. New York. \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017. Lao PDR: Accelerating structural transformation for inclusive growth \u2013 \nCountry diagnostic study. Manila. \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). ", "2 \nPrivate sector participation remains limited, leading to low investments by farms in innovative \ntechnologies. Low capacity for value addition and underdeveloped marketing systems also \ncontribute to low competitiveness. The Lao PDR ranked 141th out of 190 countries on ease of \ndoing business.5 This unfavorable environment leaves the Lao PDR with underdeveloped value \nchains, farmers with limited market options, and the economy with poor capacity for adding value \nto the primary commodities that it produces. \n6.  The Lao PDR is highly vulnerable to impacts of climate change such as increased floods \nand droughts. Climate projections suggest that daily maximum temperatures may increase by \n2\u00b0C\u20133\u00b0C by 2050, especially in the south, and exacerbate the severity of droughts.6 Likewise, \nrainfall is projected to increase by 10%\u201330% during the rainy season in southern provinces, \nthereby increasing flooding. Poor adaptation measures and low adaptive capacity increase the \nvulnerability of rural livelihoods and lead to food insecurity. \n7.  Opportunities.  Investing  in  climate-friendly  agribusiness  value  chain  infrastructure, \ncoupled with targeted capacity strengthening and policy support, is vital to overcome the above \nbarriers. Intensive production and commercialization of high-quality rice and organic vegetables, \nfacilitated by local biofertilizer production and clean agricultural technologies, can increase rural \nhousehold incomes, cut fertilizer imports, and save foreign exchange. Opportunities exist for \ndeveloping agribusinesses that cater to domestic and export markets, and for mobilizing private \nsector investment in areas such as infrastructure for storage, processing and value addition, \nbiofertilizer production, and organic agriculture. The demand for a wider range of safe and \nnutritious food by a growing base of domestic urban middle-class consumers and tourists also \nprovides opportunities for public\u2013private\u2013community partnerships that could lead to improved \nmarket  efficiency  and  inclusive  agribusiness  value  chains.  Investments  in  climate-friendly \nagribusiness will also strengthen the finance sector, as the demand for farm credit will increase. \n8.  Government\u2019s efforts. The government aims to increase the agricultural growth rate to \n3.4% per annum by 2020. The policy framework for the agriculture sector is set out in (i) the ADS \nto 2025 (footnote 1); (ii) the 8th Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016\u2013\n2020); (iii) the Development Strategy of the Crop Sector 2025 and Vision 2030; and (iv) the \nNational Strategy on Climate Change of Lao PDR.7 The ADS aims to (i) ensure food security; \n(ii) produce competitive commodities with a comparative advantage; (iii) develop a clean, safe \nand sustainable agriculture; and (iv) shift gradually to the modernization into a resilient and \nproductive agricultural economy. \n9.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The project includes innovations such as (i) improved design \nstandards of rural infrastructure to make it climate-resilient and more sustainable, (ii) adoption \nand expanded use of advanced CSA technologies and practices, and (iii) promotion of regional \ncooperation and integration in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) through harmonization of \nstandards and support to regional seed-trading agreements. Through this project, ADB aims to \nfinance key elements of the ADS through support to rice, the most important crop, and vegetables, \nthe subsector with the greatest potential for increasing rural incomes. The project will contribute \nto the government\u2019s target of 4.7 million tons of paddy production with 2 million tons of quality rice \nearmarked for domestic and export markets.

Building on public\u2013private\u2013community \npartnership models developed by earlier ADB projects, the project will promote private sector \nparticipation in value chain operations, diversify livelihood options, and assist smallholders\u2019 \ntransition from subsistence to commercial agriculture.8 By improving the capacity for quality and \nsafety testing, the project will enable farmers to access high-value markets within and beyond the \nGMS. The project complements initiatives on trade facilitation and the GMS Core Agriculture \nSupport Program.9  \n10.  Development coordination and lessons learned. The project will coordinate with (i) the \nWorld Bank in the implementation of a matching grant scheme for agribusinesses; (ii) the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in supporting vegetable farmer groups; and \n(iii) the International Rice Research Institute in deploying climate-resilient varieties. The project \ndesign includes lessons from ADB and other development partner projects.10 Lessons call for \n(i) improving the sustainability and climate resilience of infrastructure; (ii) enhancing the capacity \nof  stakeholders;  (iii) supporting  an  enabling  policy  environment  for  agribusinesses;  and \n(iv) promoting the participation of beneficiaries in the operation and maintenance (O&M) of \ninfrastructure. Lessons suggest to (i) include measures to accommodate implementation capacity \nbarriers; (ii) screen subprojects carefully to identify viable ones; (iii) limit the geographic coverage \nto obtain a balance between investments and overhead costs; and (iv) prepare subprojects that \ncan be implemented at government levels with the experience and capacity for such work. \n11.  Strategic fit. The project is aligned with the government\u2019s ADS to 2025 (footnote1), the \n8th Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016\u20132020) (footnote 7), the GMS \nRegional Investment Framework to 2022, and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132020 for \nthe Lao PDR; and is included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020.11 The project \nis aligned with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources, 2015-2020 which \naims to increase value addition and partnerships with the private sector in agro-processing.12  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: agricultural competitiveness improved.13 \nThe project will have the following outcome: productive and resource-efficient agribusiness value \nchains developed in project areas.14  \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2009.

Outputs \n13.  Output  1:  Critical  agribusiness  value  chain  infrastructure improved  and  made \nclimate-resilient. This involves rehabilitation and modernization of critical public and private \ninfrastructure to increase production and resource efficiency, reduce postharvest losses, and \nenhance  value  chain  links  while  improving  climate  resilience.  Key  activities  include \n(i) rehabilitating small-scale irrigation infrastructure (tertiary canals and water retention ponds) \nand rural roads; (ii) enhancing crop research, and safety- and quality-testing infrastructure; and \n(iii) improving climate-friendly value chain infrastructure for agribusiness enterprises. Under \nactivity (ii), the project will upgrade the facilities and services offered to farmers by rice and \nvegetable research centers in target provinces. It will also improve the infrastructure for quality \nand safety testing in the plant-protection laboratory of the Department of Agriculture, soil-testing \nlaboratory  of  the  Department  of  Agricultural  Land  Management,  and  provincial  agricultural \ncolleges. The project will establish an asset management system for rural infrastructure to ensure \nsustainability and implement a holistic approach to O&M by focusing on institutions, capacity \nbuilding, financing, and technologies. \n14.  Under  activity  (iii),  the project  will  support  the  upgrade  of  small  and  medium-sized \nagribusinesses (rice mills, vegetable pack houses, and biofertilizer factories) through a matching \ngrant  scheme.15  The  grant-receiving  agribusinesses  will  need  to  adopt  climate-friendly \ntechnologies and good manufacturing practices, support smallholder farmers in employing CSA \nand good agricultural practices and promote effective integration of smallholders in the value \nchain. Upgrades to rice mills will improve rice recovery rates and allow the separation of white \nand glutinous rice to improve access to premium domestic and export markets. Support for \nvegetable collection and marketing clusters will help reduce postharvest losses and improve the \nquality and quantity of vegetables for domestic and export markets. Upgrades to biofertilizer \nfactories will boost organic fertilizer production and encourage organic agriculture.  \n15.  Output 2: Climate-smart agriculture and agribusiness promoted. Activities include \n(i) deploying climate-resilient  rice  and  vegetable  varieties;  (ii)  strengthening  the  capacity  of \nagricultural  production  groups  (APGs)  and  agribusinesses  for  climate-smart  and  organic \nagriculture; and (iii) promoting farm mechanization through smallholder financing (footnote 16) to \nAPGs. The project will disseminate flood- and drought-tolerant varieties, and train APGs on CSA, \ngood  agricultural  practices,  crop  calendars,  preparation  of  business  plans,  and  marketing. \nAgribusinesses will be trained on good manufacturing practices; safety standards; postharvest \ncrop handling to improve quality and market access; value addition through branding, packaging, \nand  agro-processing;  and  joint  contract  harvesting  operations.  Support  to  APGs  for  farm \nmechanization includes the acquisition of small machinery for land clearance and leveling, \nplanting, on-farm micro irrigation, water storage, and application of agricultural inputs. \n16.  Output 3: Enabling environment for climate-friendly agribusiness enhanced. The \nproject will support the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and the Ministry of Industry and \nCommerce in creating an enabling policy environment to promote private sector investments \nthrough public-private partnerships, contract farming, and formation of joint APG\u2013agribusiness \nventures. Key activities include (i) formulating climate-friendly agribusiness policies such as \nsupport for land registration and development of national standards for good agricultural practices, \ngood manufacturing practices, and organic certification; and (ii) promoting green finance and \nclimate-risk-sharing mechanisms by raising the awareness of financial institutions on how to \n                                                \n15 Guidelines for Matching Grant Scheme and Smallholder Financing Scheme (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \n \nintegrate environmental and climate-risk screening criteria into credit application and reporting \nprocedures. The output will also disseminate information on climate-risk-sharing mechanisms. \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $46.37 million (Table 1).

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $40.50 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The sector lending modality \nis appropriate for this project because the government has a sector development plan (footnote \n1) and has demonstrated adequate capacity to implement the plan. Overall sector policies are \nadequate but need improvement to enable the growth of agribusinesses. The modality enables \nthe  government  to  identify  and  finance  additional  subprojects,  while  continuing  to  execute \nnecessary policy reforms in the implementation of the sector development plan.17 \n19.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures for works, \nequipment,  consulting  services,  incremental  operating  costs  and  taxes  and  duties.  The \ngovernment will finance the equivalent of $0.75 million for counterpart staff salaries and office \nspace. The beneficiaries will finance the  equivalent  of  $5.12 million as cash contribution to \nupgrade infrastructure. Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $7.53 million.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  The project preparation team considered: (i) various technical options (e.g. lining of tertiary \ncanals with brick or concrete, bioengineering measures to improve stability of farm roads, water \n ", "7 \n \nand energy conservation and management measures in agribusinesses) and their economic \nviability; (ii) options to maximize the production of rice and vegetables in irrigated and rain-fed \nareas, and expected benefits to farmers; (iii) mechanisms to strengthen forward and backward \nlinks of rice and vegetable value chains; and (iv) measures to boost the climate resilience of \ninfrastructure such as upgrading design standards, promoting cross drainage, and increasing the \nheight  of  embankments.  Technical  due  diligence  was  conducted  for  three  representative \nsubprojects: (i) upgrading the Vanida Rice Mill as a member of the Khammouane Development \nRice Millers cluster, (ii) improving a vegetable packhouse (collection point and marketing cluster), \nand  (iii)  upgrading  the  state-owned  Dongxiengdee  biofertilizer  factory.  All  representative \nsubprojects were evaluated against a set of eligibility criteria that are detailed in the PAM. The \nproject incorporates a participatory development approach, whereby beneficiaries will participate \nin  the  design  and  implementation  of  subprojects,  including  measures  to  improve  climate \nresilience, and take partial responsibility for infrastructure\u2019 O&M. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The project team conducted economic and financial analysis for the three representative \nsubprojects. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the rice mill subproject is 17.8%. The \nvegetable collection and cleaning center subproject yields an EIRR of 19.0%. The biofertilizer \nfactory subproject yields an EIRR of 14.8%. Sensitivity analysis considered several downside \nscenarios, including (i) a 10% increase in subproject costs, (ii) a 10% increase in subproject \noperating costs, and (iii) a reduction in the sales margin by 5%\u201310%. In general, the EIRRs for all \nsubprojects exceed 9% and are economically viable. \n23.  Since  the  representative  subprojects generate  revenue,  project  beneficiaries  will  be \nresponsible for routine and periodic O&M of the investments. The financial internal rates of return \nof 13.5%, 12.7%, and 10.6% exceed the weighted average cost of capital and confirm the \nsubprojects\u2019 financial viability. In addition, cash flow analyses indicate strong financial capacity \nfor  O&M  and  debt  servicing.  As  for  nonrevenue-generating  investments  such  as  irrigation \nschemes and rural roads, the government will assume the primary O&M responsibility, although \nfarmers will contribute to routine O&M. For these investments, the annual O&M requirement for \ncivil works and equipment is estimated to be $0.64 million at project completion. The amount will \nnot create an excessive fiscal burden on the government. Site selection, especially for non-\nrevenue-generating subprojects, will be determined by beneficiaries\u2019 readiness and commitment \nto assume O&M responsibility. All subprojects will develop a viable and realistic O&M plan. \nC.  Governance \n24.  Project implementation, procurement, and financial management will be aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s standard operating procedures. All procurement financed by ADB will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The overall \nprocurement  risk  is  assessed  as  moderate  because  MAF  has  considerable  experience  in \nprocuring civil works, goods, and services, under ADB projects. However, to ensure more efficient \ndelivery, procurement will be handled by the National Project Management Office and supported \nby  an  international  and  a  national  procurement  specialist.  Each  province  will  also  have  a \nprocurement specialist assigned to handle small-value procurement. The pre-mitigation financial \nmanagement risk for the project is substantial given the low capacity for accounting, budgeting, \nand financial reporting, and low quality of internal and external audit reports.19 With support from \nan international and a national financial management specialist, MAF will ensure that the National \n                                                \n19 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nProject Management Office and the provincial project implementation units maintain financial \nrecords of adequate quality. MAF will prepare consolidated project financial statements and have \nthem audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MAF. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in PAM. \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n25.  The project is classified as general intervention. It will benefit at least 100,000 people from \n20,000 households, increasing their income by at least 30% through increased crop yields, \nreduced costs of inputs and post-harvest losses and enhanced rural employment opportunities.20 \nThe project will promote inclusive economic growth, strengthen agribusiness value chains, and \nassist  in  developing  supply  arrangements  between  poor  farmers,  APGs,  cooperatives, \nprocessors, distributors, and traders. Farmers and APGs will be encouraged to produce quality \nfarm products on time, and with continuity of supply. Landless and poor households will be \nincluded in agribusiness, farm mechanization, and O&M training. Identified poor households in \nsubproject areas will be targeted for jobs related to civil works. Landless and poor farmers will \nhave the opportunity to access off-farm and on-farm employment related to postharvest support \nservices such as farm mechanization, drying, milling, grading, and storage of produce. \n26.  Gender. Women farmers are key actors in the rice and vegetable value chains. Women \nrepresent 50% of the population engaged in the agriculture sector in the target provinces. Yet the \ngender analysis found that they have less capacity (low technical skills and low awareness on \nclimate change impacts), less access to agricultural extension and business training, and a lower \nlevel of financial literacy than their male counterparts in project areas. \n27.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The project team prepared \na gender action plan, which includes gender actions and quantitative targets to promote women\u2019s \nvoice and active participation in all project activities.21 The project will promote gender equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment by enhancing women\u2019s capacity for CSA production and processing, \nmanagement,  agricultural  machinery  use  and maintenance,  and  by strengthening  the  links \nbetween enterprises led by women and the agribusiness industry. Other actions include a detailed \ngender analysis of the rice and vegetable value chains to inform the development of a gender-\nresponsive agribusiness policy. Women will be targeted for training in infrastructure-related O&M, \nand as decision-makers in the selection of climate-resilient varieties of rice and vegetables. \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.22 \n29.  Environment (category B). The three representative subprojects were found to have \nminimal environmental impacts and were classified as category C. However, category B is \nretained for the overall project as future subprojects, such as upgrade of access roads and tertiary \ncanals, may have environmental impacts. Public consultations informed the project design and \nthis  process  will  continue  during  implementation.  The  MAF  prepared  an  environmental \nassessment and review framework to guide the screening and classification of each subproject \nduring  implementation and  disclosed  it  on  the  ADB  website  in  March  2018.23  Subprojects \n                                                \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB.

Category B subprojects will require an initial \nenvironmental  examination,  including  an  environmental  management  plan.  Category  C \nsubprojects will need summaries of environmental implications in the feasibilities studies. The \nenvironmental assessment and review framework includes an environmental code of conduct for \ncontractors, which will be adopted for all category C subprojects to ensure adoption of good \nenvironmental site management practices. A project grievance redress mechanism will facilitate \nthe resolution of any safeguard-related complaints. \n30.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Subproject screening will identify and reject any \ncategory A subprojects that involve significant involuntary resettlement, economic displacement, \nor land acquisition. Due diligence conducted for the three representative subprojects shows that \nnone will result in any physical or economic displacement. Two subprojects will not require land \nacquisition while the vegetable packhouse subproject will need minimal land acquisition through \nvoluntary donation. However, as most of the subprojects will be prepared after Board approval, \nMAF prepared a land acquisition and resettlement framework to guide the screening and selection \nof subprojects as well as the resettlement planning process, and uploaded to the ADB website in \nMarch  2018.24  During  project  preparation, some  irrigation  and farm  road  subprojects  were \nidentified that would require the acquisition of small strips of land to accommodate improvements \nto the distribution canals or the widening of farm road alignments. These small strips of land may \nbe acquired through (i) voluntary donation, (ii) negotiated settlement, or (iii) involuntary land \nacquisition. A rigorous due diligence procedure to verify bona fide voluntary donation is included \nin the resettlement framework to further screen and select subprojects during implementation and \nguide the preparation of any resettlement plans, if required. If negotiated settlement (willing buyer \n\u2013 willing seller) is used, (i) MAF will involve an external third party to validate and document the \nprocess; and (ii) MAF will submit the report with supporting documents to ADB for concurrence \nbefore any civil works commence. If the land is acquired involuntarily, MAF will prepare the land \nacquisition and resettlement plan in accordance with the land acquisition and resettlement \nframework and sent to ADB for concurrence and disclosure before the bidding documents are \nissued. MAF will update due diligence reports for the sample subprojects based on the detailed \ndesign and prepare the safeguard planning documents for all non-sample subprojects for ADB \nreview before any contracts are awarded. \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Due diligence on the three representative subprojects \nshowed that many ethnic groups are living in the project provinces. The vegetable hub subproject, \nfor example, includes 50% of members of an ethnic group. However, no indigenous peoples were \nfound in the three representative subproject areas, and no indigenous peoples plan (IPP) was \nprepared. The MAF prepared an ethnic group development framework, which was disclosed on \nthe ADB website in March 2018, to guide the preparation of IPPs as needed during project \nimplementation, which will ensure inclusion and the full consultation and participation of ethnic \ngroup households and communities.25 Where indigenous peoples are impacted by a subproject, \ndepending on the extent and complexity, either a separate IPP will be prepared, or elements of \nan IPP will be included in the subproject feasibility study report. Adequate resources were \nallocated  to  the  preparation,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  of  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards, and associated capacity development. Building on experience with \npast ADB projects, the government committed to and has capacity  to manage social and \nenvironmental risks, including various safeguard frameworks and plans. \n                                                \n24 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework: Ethnic Group Development Framework (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.

ASSURANCES \n33.  The government and MAF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and grant agreement. The government and MAF have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the grant agreement. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n34.
