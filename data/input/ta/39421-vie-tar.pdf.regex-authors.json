During the formulation of the country strategy and program for Viet Nam (2007\u20132010),1 \nthe Government of Viet Nam (the Government) requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  Quality  and  Safety  Improvement  of  Agricultural \nProducts Project.2 ADB\u2019s TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam in December 2006 and \nreached understanding with the Government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s 2007 assistance program for Viet Nam. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  Government\u2019s  long-term  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  was  elaborated  in  its \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) announced in May 2002.The \nCPRGS emphasized the importance of agriculture and rural development in reducing rural \npoverty  and  contributing  to  sustainable  and  equitable  economic  growth.  CPRGS\u2019  strategic \nthrusts are now reflected in the 5-year Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP: 2006\u20132010) \nlaunched in June 2006. SEDP is also the country\u2019s current poverty reduction strategy and aims \nto (i) accelerate sustainable economic growth and development; (ii) improve people\u2019s material, \ncultural, and spiritual life; (iii) create the foundations to boost industrialization and modernization \nand to gradually develop a knowledge-based economy; and (iv) improve the country\u2019s regional \nand global status. SEDP particularly emphasizes the importance of business development in \nachieving sustainable growth, and the need for increased competitiveness of agricultural and \nagro-based products with improved product quality and food safety. \n \n3.  The agriculture sector in Viet Nam demonstrated rapid growth averaging about 4% per \nannum during the last decade. Food security has improved at the national level and the country \nhas turned from a net food importer into one of the world\u2019s major exporters of a number of \nagricultural products. The sector\u2019s growth was largely supported by the market-oriented policy \nand institutional reforms initiated in the late 1980s, and by increased investment in irrigation and \nother  inputs.  However,  continued  agricultural  growth  will  require  both  diversified  farming \nsystems  appropriate  for  varied  agro-ecological  conditions,  and  more  locally  driven \nimprovements in productivity, value, and quality of agricultural production. To address this issue \nin the medium term, the Government aims to (i) promote production and processing of high-\nvalue products; (ii) improve agricultural research, extension, and market information services; (iii) \nintensify efforts to ensure better product quality and food safety based on sound agricultural \npractices; and (iv)  promote agribusiness and agro-based enterprises. \n \n4.  In the country\u2019s upland areas, commercial crop production has shown rapid growth with \nimproved  access  to  domestic  and  international  markets.  Due  to  increased  commercial \nproduction, high average annual growth rates in the recent 5 years have been recorded for  \nvegetables (3.7%), tea (8.9%), coffee (8.5%), and fruits (7.9%). Dynamic entrepreneurship of \nVietnamese farmers contributed to such high growth rates and led to the expansion of rural \nbusiness households, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Increased efforts for \npromoting commercial values in the supply chains of these agricultural products are urgently \nrequired  and  must  be  based  on  improved  access  to  advanced  technology  in  production, \npostharvest operations, and marketing. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. September 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010): Viet Nam. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 22 November 2006.  \n ", "2   \n5.  Quality  and  Safety  Improvements  in  Agricultural  Products.  As  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nagricultural sector becomes increasingly integrated with domestic and international markets, \nimprovements in product quality and food safety assume greater importance, with key concerns \nbeing meat hygiene (as high as 77% of pigmeat3 infected by salmonella and the average \nincidence of diarrhea is 1.5 cases per person per year), and pesticide residues with more than \n10% of all vegetables sold having residues higher than national standards, while antibiotic \nresidues4 in  meat  is  also  a  major  concern.  The  country\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade \nOrganization in November 2006 accelerated the implementation of the Government\u2019s action \nprograms for strengthening the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks for food safety. The \nGovernment also recognizes that to date, most of the extension effort has been directed at \nincreasing  on-farm  productivity  by  increasing  inputs 5  made  possible  by  improved  rural \ninfrastructure (improved access). The impacts from such changes have only recently attracted \ninternational attention. The Government recognizes that this must be addressed throughout the \nlength of the marketing chain as food quality is only as good as its weakest point. Efforts need \nto  be  directed  at  agricultural  research,  extension,  marketing,  postharvest  operations,  and \nproduct grading and certification. However, financial and human resources in the public sector \nprevent the establishment of an effective regulatory mechanism, and scarce resources are often \nscattered. Close coordination among related activities is essential.6 \n \n6.  Efficient Value Chains for Agricultural Products. In Viet Nam, agricultural marketing \nactivities remain largely local, and linkages between producers, traders, and consumers are not \nwell developed. With small scale production still dominating rural industries, the challenge of \nproduct aggregation continues to threaten food quality as marketing chains tend to be extended \nwith many commercial entities along its length. Contractual arrangements between producers \nand  processors  are  rare  though  increasing  in  certain  commodities  such  as  cashew  nuts, \npeanuts, tobacco and sugar cane in the central and south central regions. The role of the state \nin  promoting  closer  linkages  is  being  achieved  through  SOE  factories  processing  primary \nproduce but is limited to commercial interests of the processors. Efforts to introduce safety \nstandards and confirm the hygiene status need to be encouraged to generate increased value \nadded from various commodity and product supply chains but starting at the producer. Any \ndelay in addressing food safety and SPS problems is likely to adversely impact on  export \ncompetitiveness.   \n \n7.  Strengthened Producers and Private SMEs. Continued reforms in the Government\u2019s \npolicies and institutions are also required in line with the shift of focus to commercial production \nand marketing of agricultural and agro-based products other than rice in which Viet Nam has \nsucceeded in becoming a major player in the international market. Production and marketing of \ndiversified crops outside SOEs need to be further promoted. While significant private SME \nprocessing of agricultural and aquaculture produce is already evident, the legal and regulatory \nenvironment is also being addressed by ADB,7 There remains a need for medium to long-term \nfunds to assist private SMEs in diversifying their production, marketing, and processing activities \nthat should incorporate appropriate postharvest handling operations. SME growth is expected to \n                                                 \n3 Per capita consumption levels of pork is higher than any other fresh meat in Viet Nam. \n4 Antibiotics are widely used in Viet Nam as a routine precautionary measure and incorporated in feed rations in \nintensive poultry and pig producing units. \n5 Inputs include not only fertilizer but also water for irrigation and the associated pests and diseases the higher water \nregimes attract such as fungus in rice and vegetable crops and new pests that previously were less prevalent. \n6  External funding agencies, including the governments of Australia and Canada, have initiated assistance to the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) in these areas. \n7  ADB. 2004.

ADB has provided loan and TA projects in agriculture to support the Government\u2019s \ncritical policy and institutional reform measures for market-oriented growth and to increase \nagricultural productivity through improved research, extension, and market information systems. \nThese operations are being satisfactorily implemented, and the Government is highly committed \nto pursuing the reforms for market liberalization and achieving a smooth transition from the \nproduction  system  based  on  centralized  planning  to  production  and  marketing  initiated  by \nindividual  farmers  and  private  traders.  ADB  also  provided  TA,  in  collaboration  with  the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  to  undertake  analytical \nresearch work on operational and policy issues linked to market development for pro-poor \ndevelopment outcomes, and help build local capacity for undertaking policy-oriented research.8 \nConsidering sector knowledge and the relevant lessons and experiences accumulated through \nthese operations, ADB will continue to support Government efforts in the sector, with increased \nfocus on producing and marketing agricultural and agro-based products with better quality and \nassured safety. \n \n9.  In view of the foregoing, the project for improving the quality and safety of agricultural \nproducts will support the Government\u2019s new SEDP for agriculture and rural development in line \nwith ADB\u2019s new country strategy and program for Viet Nam, by promoting a business-led, pro-\npoor, and sustainable economic growth with emphasis on private agro-based SMEs. The project \ndesign will be consistent with and complement the ongoing and planned projects of ADB and \nother external funding agencies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA aims to assist the Government in formulating a detailed investment proposal to \nimprove  the  quality  and  safety  of  agricultural  and  agro-based  products.  It  will  ultimately \ncontribute  to  the  country\u2019s  sustainable,  pro-poor  agricultural  growth  by  increasing  the \ncompetitiveness  of  agricultural  and  agro-based  products  and  improving  linkages  among \nstakeholders  (producers,  traders,  product  processors,  and  consumers).  It  will  increase \ncommodity  and  product  values  along  their  supply  chains,  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of \nrelevant institutions. The expected outcome of the ensuing project includes (i) improved quality \nand safety standards of agricultural and agro-based products; (ii) increased number of viable \nSMEs in agriculture and agro-industry; and (iii) strengthened capacity and improved awareness \nof central and local-level government institutions, farmers, and private enterprises. The design \nand monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA activities will be implemented in two phases: analytical sector reviews, and \nproject design and consensus building. During the first phase, the TA will (i) assess the overall \neconomy and rural development contexts in Viet Nam; (ii) assess the agriculture sector and \nSME  lending  operations,  including  the  policies  and  strategies  of  the  Government,  and \navailability of and gaps in funds for SMEs; (iii) analyze the current status relating to quality and \nsafety of agricultural and agro-based products, including opportunities, issues, and regulatory \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003.

Manila (TA 6113-REG). \n ", "4   \nand institutional frameworks; (iv) examine the potentials of and constraints to sustainable crop \ndevelopment and agribusiness development; (v) examine the current situation and activities of \nvarious stakeholders along the supply chains of the selected priority crops and processed \nproducts,  including  seed  production,  producers\u2019  farming  systems,  capacity  of  processing \nfacilities, and domestic and international market situations and marketing channels; (vi) review \nperformance and important lessons from past and ongoing projects of ADB and other external \nfunding agencies; and (vii) formulate sector and subsector road maps to present medium- to \nlong-term initiatives and visions for the sustainable and equitable growth of the agriculture \nsector.  \n \n12.  On  the basis of the outcome of the first phase, the TA will (i) examine, evaluate, and \nmake recommendations on alternative investment options to improve the quality and safety of \nagricultural and agro-based products, and increase product competitiveness; (ii) examine the \nperformance  and  capacity  of  the  relevant  institutions  and  staff  involved  in  agribusiness \ndevelopment, postharvest research, extension, and market information services at central and \nlocal levels; (iii) identify priority crops and potential project provinces with the use of appropriate \ncriteria and in consultation with the Government and ADB; (iv) prepare a detailed investment \nproject  proposal  that  can  be  considered  for  possible  ADB  financing,  with  appropriate \nimplementation and funding arrangements; (v) help prepare the Government's feasibility studies \nfor the project proposal; (vi) assess institutional, environmental, public health, and social risks, \nand formulate measures to ensure adequate safeguards; (vii) estimate financial and economic \ncosts and benefits of the project proposal; and (viii) assess the impact of the proposed project \non  the  agriculture  sector,  agricultural  production  and  productivity,  employment,  external \nearnings, role of women, livelihood of ethnic minority groups, environment, and public health. \n \n13.  The TA will help formulate consensus on the proposed project design and on necessary \npolicy and institutional measures for effective implementation by involving a wide range of key \nstakeholders at critical milestones of the TA. The TA outputs will be regularly discussed among \nkey  stakeholders,  including  relevant  government  agencies,  provincial  governments,  farmer \ngroups,  universities,  private  enterprises,  external  funding  agencies,  and  civil  society \norganizations. Consultative workshops and seminars will be organized in different regions and \nselected provinces in the country to obtain appropriate feedback and disseminate TA findings.  \n \n14.  A  detailed  project  proposal  for  an  ensuing  loan  project  will  be  formulated  at  TA \ncompletion. The project scope is expected to include (i) strengthening  support services in \nagriculture; (ii) assisting agribusiness households and enterprise development; (iii) improving \nrelevant  sector  policies,  institutions,  and  infrastructure;  (iv)  strengthening  public-private \npartnership  in  selected  commercial  crops;  and  (v)  strengthening  local-level  capacity  to \nimplement  the  decentralization  policy  of  the  Government,  and  to  improve  technology  and \ndelivery of market information services. The project is expected to have a positive impact on \npoverty reduction among the poor. Special attention will be given to specific social issues \nrelated  to  gender  and  ethnic  minority  groups.  An  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 2. Another positive impact will be the reduction of public health and environmental \nrisks through improved practices in crop production, pest management, and product processing. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $950,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $750,000, \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nbalance of the TA costs, amounting to $200,000 equivalent, will be met by the Government in kind: \noffice accommodations, counterpart staff support, facilities for seminars and  meetings, other \n ", "  5\nadministrative expenses, and part of local transport costs. The Government has been informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. A tentative cost \ntable is in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  MARD  will  act  as  Executing  Agency  for  TA  implementation.  MARD  has  extensive \nexperience in administering externally funded projects in Viet Nam. An interdepartmental project \npreparation  group  of  MARD,  comprising  technical  personnel  designated  by  the  relevant \ndepartments, will be established to act as the direct counterpart group for the TA, provide policy \nand  technical  guidance,  and  facilitate  resolution  of  outstanding  TA  implementation  issues. \nRepresentatives  of  key  potential  provinces  will  be  invited  as  required.  MARD,  through  its \nInternational Cooperation Department, will also ensure  central-level interministerial coordination \nwith the relevant agencies of the Government, including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of \nIndustry, Ministry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Science and \nTechnology,  Ministry of Trade, and  State Bank of Viet Nam. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months, August 2007\u2013 March 2008. It will provide 70 \nperson-months of consulting services, comprising 28 person-months of international and 42 \nperson-months  of  national  expertise  in  agricultural  economics,  agronomy,  postharvest \noperations, SME credit, institutional development, agricultural marketing, financial and economic \nanalyses,  social  development,  and  environmental  and  public  health  assessment.  The \ninternational agricultural economist will lead the TA consultant team. An international consulting \nfirm will provide all the international and national consulting services. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). The quality- and cost-based selection method will be used, and the \nshortlisted firms will present simplified technical proposals. The consultant will purchase the \nnecessary  office  equipment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Equipment procured will be handed over to the Government at TA \ncompletion. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  The TA will organize stakeholder workshops to disseminate outputs, obtain feedback \nand views, refine the project proposal, and ensure close liaison with key stakeholders at the \nnational, regional, and provincial levels as appropriate. Tripartite review meetings involving the \nGovernment, the TA consultant team, and ADB will be organized at least three times at critical \nmilestone events. The consultant will prepare (i) a TA inception report, including a detailed work \nprogram, to be submitted within 3 weeks of the start of the TA and to be discussed at the initial \ntripartite review meeting; (ii) an interim report to present preliminary findings, to be submitted by \nthe end of the fourth month of the TA and to be discussed at the interim tripartite review meeting; \n(iii)  a  draft  final  report  about  1  month  before  TA  completion  and  to  be  discussed  at  \n national- and regional-level workshops and at the final tripartite review meeting; and (iv) a final \nreport upon TA completion. At least 15 copies of each report will be provided to the Government. \nKey outputs of the TA will be translated into Vietnamese as required. The TA review missions of \nADB will coincide with the tripartite review meetings.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the Quality and Safety Improvement of Agricultural \nProducts Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nSustainable and  \u2022 Aggregate value  \u2022 National income and  \u2022 Medium-term \nequitable agricultural  added and exports of  export statistics  macroeconomic stability \ngrowth achieved  the agriculture sector  \u2022 Monitoring by the  maintained \n  to increase at about  Ministry of Planning and  \u2022 Steady progress in the \n  3.0\u22123.2% and  Investment (MPI) and the  commercialization of the \n12.3\u221214.3%,  Ministry of Agriculture  country\u2019s agriculture sector \nrespectively, per  and Rural Development  \u2022 Effective dissemination of \nannum during  (MARD)  the positive economic \n2006\u22122010 in line  \u2022 Dialogue between the  impact to poor \nwith the  Asian Development Bank  communities \nGovernment\u2019s 5-year  (ADB) missions and the  Risk \nSocio-Economic  Government and other  \u2022 Slow progress in \nDevelopment Plan  key stakeholders  supportive infrastructure \n(SEDP)  development in rural \n\u2022 Project contribution to  transport and \nreducing nationwide  communications \npoverty by half from   \n22% in 2005 \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nA detailed investment  \u2022 An appropriate project  \u2022 Monitoring by MPI and  \u2022 Continued Government \nproject proposal agreed  proposal prepared  MARD  commitment to more \nupon by the  and agreed upon  \u2022 Dialogue between ADB  efficient market-oriented \nGovernment and other  within 8 months for  missions and key  systems in the agriculture \nkey stakeholders for  possible ADB  stakeholders  sector \nimproving quality and  financing  \u2022 Relevant studies under  \u2022 Steady progress in sector \nsafety of agricultural  \u2022 Project design  ADB technical  reforms for a more \nproducts  formulated in line with  assistance (TA 6113- effective national \n  the Government\u2019s  REG) for pro-poor  agriculture science and \n  SEDP and ADB\u2019s  marketing of agricultural  technology system \ncountry strategy and   and agro-based products   \nprogram for Viet Nam     \n(2007\u20132009)   \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

The sector\u2019s shares are expected to decrease due to the relatively more \nrapid growth of the industry and service sectors. However, agriculture will continue to play an important \neconomic  role  in  achieving  sustainable  and  equitable  growth  and  in  reducing  rural  poverty.  The \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS), which is the Government\u2019s long-term \nstrategy for poverty reduction, emphasizes the importance of agriculture and rural development in poverty \nreduction, particularly in upland and remote areas. This strategic thrust of CPRGS is clearly reflected in \nthe 5-year Socio-Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) launched in June 2006. The ensuing loan \nproject will contribute to achieving the poverty reduction objectives of the Government\u2019s strategy and plan. \n \n \nB.
