The Government of Nepal requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Community Livestock Development Project \n(CLDP).1  The  ADB  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Nepal  during  11-18  November  2002  and \nconsulted with representatives of the Government, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), aid \nagencies, and the private sector. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government \non the objectives, scope, cost estimates and financing plan, implementation arrangements, and \noutline terms of reference for the TA.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita income of $246 in \nFY2001  and  about  42%  of  the  population  below  the  poverty  line.3  Despite  significant \nimprovements  in  economic  and  social  indicators  over  the  past  2  decades,  poverty  is  still \nwidespread.  While  Nepal  was  one  of  the  countries  in  Asia  that  recorded  a  significant \nimprovement  in  the  human  development  index  (HDI)  over  the  last  decade,4  the  level  of \nindicators remains low. Inequalities across geographic regions and ecological zones and the \nrural-urban divide remain wide, as do those across gender, ethnic, and caste lines. Poverty is \nmuch more prevalent, intense, and severe in rural areas where poverty incidence (44%) is \nalmost double that in urban areas (23%).5 \n \n3.  Livestock  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Nepalese  agriculture  system.  Many  poor  rural \nhouseholds raise livestock, which is valued for its contribution to family nutrition and income, as \na  capital  reserve,  and  for  social  obligations  and  prestige.  Livestock  contributes  to  the \nsustainability of agriculture systems by producing dung for compost, and almost all the draft \npower for cropping and threshing. Livestock is the only source of high-value protein\u2015milk, milk \nproducts, meat, and eggs\u2015in the diet of poor families. Livestock provides about 20% of the total \nrural household income from the sale of products such as milk and meat. On average, 75% of \nhouseholds keep cattle, and 51% keep goats, buffalo, and rural chicken. Farmers with smaller \nlandholdings of between 0.2 and 0.5 hectare (ha) keep almost 25% of the livestock. The \nlandless or near landless (less than 0.2 ha) own about 11% of the livestock. Women play a \nsignificant role in managing and taking care of livestock, contributing 70% of the work effort in \nlivestock raising. \n \n4.  The growth of agriculture over the last 10 years has been a modest 2.7%. Livestock on \nthe other hand has grown on average by 3.6% per year and contributes 31% to the agricultural \ngross domestic product. Dairy, the most important livestock component, contributes 63% of the \ntotal livestock contribution to agricultural gross domestic product, followed by meat (32%) and \neggs (5%). However, the productivity of livestock is generally low and needs improvement. The \nlow productivity is largely due to poor livestock quality, feed and fodder quality and availability, \ndisease control, and management. Marketing of livestock, slaughtering, and processing remain \ninefficient, and the cost of production is high. Removing the constraints facing the subsector will \n                                                 \n1  The Government has already prepared a project prefeasibility study on its own, indicating its ownership of the \nProject, but which requires additional consultant inputs to produce a full feasibility study. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 21 November 2002. \n3  The national poverty line is set at about NRs4,400 ($77) per capita per annum and based on calorie intake, \nhousing, and various nonfood standards. \n4  The HDI value for Nepal was 0.42 in 1990, placing Nepal in 152nd position. The value has significantly increased \nto 0.49, improving the ranking to 142nd position in 2000. \n5  ADB. 2002. Poverty Reduction in Nepal. Manila. ", "2   \nprovide further opportunities for livestock growth to be exploited. Livestock can then contribute \nmore to growth in the agriculture sector, and to poverty reduction. \n \n5.  The ADB Nepal Livestock Sector Review and reviews of the ongoing Third Livestock \nDevelopment Project (TLDP)6 have shown the importance of the livestock sector and project \ninterventions  in  increasing  poor  families\u2019  incomes.  Under  previous  ADB  projects  and  the \nongoing TLDP, the use of farmer groups and the gradual withdrawal of the Department of \nLivestock Services (DLS) from the provision of livestock extension services in favor of private \nsector service providers have been successfully undertaken. These developments need to be \nreinforced and replicated more widely. DLS must continue to focus more on formulating policy, \nmonitoring, reviewing, and regulating development activities, and leave field implementation and \nproduction-oriented activities to the private sector. DLS also needs to promote private sector \ninvolvement and investment in the livestock subsector through support in the form of training \nand technical information, by facilitating the availability of inputs such as microfinance and \nensuring a favorable policy environment. \n \n6.  The ongoing TLDP has had a significant impact in increasing beneficiary incomes. \nLessons learned from past and current interventions (such as TLDP) have identified a number \nof opportunities and constraints in the subsector. The involvement of stakeholders in selecting \npriority \u201cpocket\u201d areas and in program planning and implementation is an important factor in \nachieving better results. All stakeholders highly appreciate livestock action teams in project \ndistricts  for  the  latter's  usefulness  in  project  planning,  but  the  teams\u2019  role  in  supporting \nimplementation and monitoring needs to be strengthened. Elaborating and institutionalizing the \nconcept in the planning system of local authorities are therefore important governance issues. \nPublic-private partnerships work very well in certain aspects of livestock subsector development \nprograms such as research and extension and should be encouraged. Promotion of district-level \ncooperatives for small-scale milk processing and marketing not only provides increased milk \nmarket  outlets  and  income  for  farmers,  but  also  creates  employment.  Social  mobilization \nthrough community-based organizations (CBOs) and NGOs has increased the participation of \nwomen and disadvantaged families in livestock development programs. A mechanism to ensure \nthe sustainability of such approaches needs to be designed, tested, and handed over to local \nauthorities. As livestock farming becomes more commercialized, there is a need for field staff \nfrom support agencies to broaden their capabilities to advise on marketing, processing, and \nagribusiness matters. While CBOs and NGOs have facilitated the expansion of credit delivery, \nreadily available rural credit is still a problem that needs to be addressed. \n \n7.  The October 2001 Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement between ADB and the \nGovernment emphasizes the need to accelerate economic growth while addressing the rising \ntrend in income inequality. Economic growth must be more pro-poor to ensure higher growth in \nthe agriculture sector through diversification to crops with higher value-added and noncrop \nagriculture like livestock, with provision of credit as a priority. The objectives of the Tenth Five-\nYear Development Plan (2003-2008) in agriculture are to (i) enhance food and nutrition security \nby increasing production and productivity in the agriculture sector, and (ii) develop agro-based \nindustries. The objectives will be achieved in part by commercializing agriculture, diversifying \nagricultural production, and implementing integrated package programs to increase the output \nof livestock products. \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Third Livestock Development Project. Manila. ", "    3 \n8.  The livestock subsector is a major contributor to growth in agriculture, increased farm \nincomes, and poverty reduction, particularly for poor women. The TA and the proposed Project \nwill build on the lessons learned from past experience and the fact that smallholder livestock \nproduction, as demonstrated in previous ADB projects and TLDP, is an effective means of \nreducing rural poverty, especially for women, for whom rearing of household animals provides \nrelatively easy access to income, improved family nutritional levels, and empowerment. The TA \nand  the  proposed  Project  will  seek  to  ensure  that  the  policy  environment  favors  the \ndevelopment of the skills of livestock farmers and entrepreneurs (processors and marketers); \nthat farmers and entrepreneurs have the capacity to plan and manage their enterprises; that \nrequired inputs and services are readily accessible; that livestock marketing becomes more \nefficient and low cost; that good markets for livestock products exist; that a competent and \nefficient DLS can effectively monitor, evaluate, and control quality; and that planning for the \nfuture is participatory, holistic, and flexible to adapt to changing circumstances. The focus will be \non sustainable and socially equitable development. The proposed Project is consistent with the \nGovernment\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and  gender  strategies  as  enunciated  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s Tenth Five-Year Plan, the Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement between \nthe Government and ADB, and ADB\u2019s 2002 Country Strategy and Program Update. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA will assist the Government to update its prefeasibility study and design an \ninvestment project that is suitable for external financing. The project goal is to reduce the level \nof poverty for 63,000 farming families in Nepal by improving family nutrition and providing \nincome and employment opportunities arising from improved livestock keeping. A package of \nassistance to improve livestock productivity and farmer capability will directly address poverty-\nrelated  issues,  while  improved  access  to  markets  for  livestock  products  will  enhance  the \nlivelihoods of farmers in all five regions of Nepal. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The  TA  will  design  a  project  that  targets  poverty  reduction,  economic  growth, \nemployment  generation,  promotion  of  private  sector  involvement  and  public-private \npartnerships, human resource development, and greater capacity of the public and private \nsector (including NGOs) to deliver microfinance, inputs, and services. The main beneficiaries \nwill  be  poor  rural  women  and  smallholder  farmers  who  will  be  assisted  in  producing  and \nmarketing livestock and livestock products. A summary initial poverty and social analysis is in \nAppendix 1. The ensuing project will cover such activities as (i) community mobilization and \ngender  integration;  (ii)  animal  productivity  improvement;  (iii)  strengthening  institutions  and \ndeveloping their capability; (iv) commercializing, processing and marketing animal products; and \n(v) a pilot project for livestock development at high altitudes. \n \n11.  A number of principles will guide the project design and implementation. A people-\ncentered focus will be adopted, as well as a pro-poor focus concentrating on small investments, \nsmaller animals, lower risk ventures, forage development, farmer organizations, and training. A \nparticipatory  approach  involving  various  techniques  employed  in  TLDP  will  direct  project \nplanning and implementation. The proven farmer group and pocket package approach of TLDP \nwill be adopted with modifications. Institutional mechanisms such as livestock action teams that \nfacilitate a participatory approach and coordinated stakeholder effort at the local level will be \ncontinued.  A  market-led  development  approach  will  be  followed.  Because  of  its  relatively ", "4   \nunderdeveloped status, meat production rather than milk production will be emphasized. A \ngender-sensitive approach will ensure that women represent at least 50% of the participants in \nall project activities. A partnership approach in which the respective strengths and resources of \nthe  public  sector  (DLS  and  associated  line  agencies),  the  private  sector  (NGOs,  CBOs, \nentrepreneurs,  and  private  sector  associations),  and  farmers  (in  groups,  associations,  or \ncooperatives) are combined and utilized will be used. The project design will provide flexibility \nfor  subsequent  project  management\u2015project  elements  can  be  modified  as  progress  and \nexperience dictate. \n \n12.  The TA is expected to prepare a project covering 56 districts. Ten are districts in the \nMidwestern and Far Western regions currently covered by TLDP, and an additional 8 districts \nare in the Far Western and Eastern regions of the country. Those districts will have all four \nproject components. Another 30 districts (18 under TLDP and 12 new districts) in the Western, \nCentral,  and  Eastern  regions  will  receive  assistance  to  improve  market  access  and  the \nprocessing of meat and milk. The high-altitude pilot project will be introduced in eight districts in \nthe Midwestern and Far Western development regions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $272,000 and local currency cost of $228,000 equivalent. ADB will provide \n$400,000 to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $128,000 equivalent in local currency \ncost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The Government \nhas given its assurance that when the TA begins, it will contribute the remaining local currency \ncost of $100,000 equivalent for office accommodation, equipment, counterpart staff support, \nfield transport, facilities for seminars and meetings, and other administrative expenses. The \nGovernment will provide all relevant information required for the TA activities. Details of the cost \nestimates  and  financing  plan  are  in  Appendix  2.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be DLS, which will establish a TA implementation \nunit attached to the existing TLDP project office. DLS will (i) appoint a qualified and full-time TA \nproject coordinator (a deputy director general of DLS), and sufficient counterpart and support \nstaff to provide overall support and coordination; (ii) assist in providing transportation for the \nconsultants  and  government  counterparts;  (iii)  provide  office  space,  equipment,  utilities, \nfurnishings, and local communications facilities for the consultants and counterparts; and (iv) \nassist  with  surveys,  stakeholder  workshops,  and  participatory  exercises.  The  TA  project \ncoordinator will coordinate TA implementation with the concerned government ministries and \nagencies, NGOs, aid agencies, and other stakeholders as required. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented in three phases over 4 months from February to May 2003, \n(Appendix 3). Phase 1 (1 month) will involve preparing a draft work plan and identifying new \ntarget areas and areas where to continue the ongoing TLDP; and conducting a detailed poverty \nand  social  analysis,  including  rapid  rural  appraisals,  identifying  stakeholders,  and  initiating \nbaseline surveys. Phase 2 (2 months) will involve reviewing lessons learned and incorporating \nthem into the project design, holding participatory workshops, completing the baseline surveys, \ncollecting data, preparing a benefit monitoring and evaluation program for the project, planning \nthe scope of the project components, and identifying policy issues. Phase 3 (1 month) will \ninvolve finalizing the feasibility study for an investment project. ", "    5 \n \n16.  Extensive  participatory  consultation  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  will  develop \ncommitment to the participatory development process that will be promoted during the project\u2019s \ndesign and implementation. At the end of phase 1, the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives \nwill form a TA advisory group (based on the existing TLDP project coordination committee), \ncomprising stakeholder representatives (potential beneficiaries, NGOs, and the private sector) \nand chaired by the director general of DLS. The advisory group will work closely with the TA \nconsultants  by  participating  in  workshops  and  working  groups  and  contributing  to  the \nparticipatory planning process to develop the project strategies and design. \n \n17.  The consulting services for the TA total 35.5 person-months: 12 international and 23.5 \ndomestic. The international consultants will have experience in (i) participatory approaches \n(team leader), (ii) institutional strengthening, (iii) agricultural economics, (iv) livestock forage and \nfeed, and (iv) livestock marketing. The domestic consultants will have experience in (i) livestock \nforage and feed (deputy team leader); (ii) rural microfinance; (iii) poverty reduction and social \nanalysis/NGOs;  (iv)  gender  issues;  (v)  milk  processing;  (vi)  meat  processing;  (vii)  animal \nproduction  and  poultry;  (viii)  institutional  strengthening,  training,  and  participation;  and  (ix) \nenvironmental assessment. ADB will engage the international and domestic consultants as \nindividuals in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The  international  team  leader  and \ndomestic deputy team leader will manage the consultant team and TA output finalization. The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  The Government has agreed to provide necessary office equipment, and the TA will \nprovide any additional required equipment that the consultant will purchase in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The equipment will be handed over to DLS upon completion \nof the TA. The TA will also provide funds for workshops, working group studies, and surveys to \nbe conducted by the consultants in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB. \n \n19.  The consultants will prepare (i) an inception report 2 weeks after the TA starts, for \ndiscussion at the inception tripartite meeting; (ii) a progress report to be submitted 2 months \nafter the TA starts, before the second tripartite meeting; (iii) a draft final report after 3.25 \nmonths, before the final tripartite meeting; and (iv) a final report at the conclusion of the \nconsulting services. All reports will be submitted to the Government, the advisory group, and \nADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof Nepal for preparing the Community Livestock Development Project, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. The technical assistance, initially financed as a grant, will be subject to the \nreimbursement arrangements set forth in Technical Assistance Operations7 and Streamlining of \nTechnical Assistance Operations.8 If the technical assistance results in an ADB loan, ADB may \ncharge  against  the  loan,  and  recover  from  it,  the  portion  of  the  initial  grant  that  exceeds \n$250,000 equivalent. \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1977.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national  Yes   Sector identified as a national  Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in (Nepal): \n \nAgriculture accounts for 40% of the gross domestic product, and the livestock sector contributes 31% to the \nagricultural gross domestic product. The country ranks 142nd out of 173 countries and has a human development \nindex (HDI) of 0.49, lower than the weighted average for South Asia (0.57). A comparison of HDI values across the \nfive development regions of Nepal highlights significant differences in human capabilities. For instance, the HDI of the \nMidwestern and Far Western regions at 0.402 and 0.385 respectively, are much lower than the HDI of the Central \n(0.493), Eastern (0.484), and Western regions (0.479). The gender-related development index follows the same \npattern as the HDI, higher in the Central (0.476), Eastern (0.465) and Western (0.463) regions, and lower in \nMidwestern (0.376) and Far Western regions (0.356). Significant differences between urban and rural areas also \nemerge. Rural poverty at 42% is twice as high as that for urban poverty (23%), indicating that poverty is more intense \nand severe in rural areas where 88% of the total population reside. The population growth rate increased from 2.1% \nin 1991 to 2.3% in 2001. The increase was concentrated in rural areas, with rural women having more than twice as \nmany children (4.4) as urban women (2.1). In the rural areas, poverty persists and development interventions to \naddress disparities are needed. \n \nLivestock plays a vital role in food security for the poor. It is the only source of high-value protein in the diet and \nprovides 20% of total household income in the hills. High rural population growth without commensurate growth in \nemployment opportunities has forced many farmers to intensify the use of public land, forests, and marginal lands. \nData on investment in livestock per household shows considerable increases since 1997/98, but when different \nquintiles are compared, the poorest had higher investments than those in the higher quintiles (13.2% compared with \n4.8% of incomes, respectively). The strategy of the rural poor to increase animal numbers with the intention of \nincreasing productivity without improvements in breeding management and animal feed has not contributed to \nimproving household food security. Rather, it has increased pressure on grazing land, with negative environmental \nimpacts and devastating effects on the poor, particularly women, as they collect animal feed primarily on marginal \nand fragile lands. Consequently, livestock productivity has remained low. The most serious limiting factor in livestock \nproduction is the acute shortage of feed supply, with only 66% of annual requirements available. When more than \n80% of the economically active population are engaged in crop-livestock-forest integrated farming systems, improved \nperformance of the livestock sector can be decisive in reducing poverty. Since a large number of smallholder farmers \nand the landless raise livestock, targeted development of the livestock subsector will significantly raise the incomes of \nthe poor. Attention needs to be focused on identifying and developing market opportunities to enable poor farmers to \ninvest in livestock inputs, such as improved animal nutrition and health and better animal husbandry methods \nnecessary for increased productivity.  \n \nThe proposed Project is supportive of the Agriculture Perspective Plan and the Tenth Five-Year Plan and seeks to \npromote income growth of men and women farmers, and support poor farmers who become involved in producing, \nprocessing, and marketing livestock products, especially in the hinterlands; expanding poor farmers' access to larger \nmarket centers; disseminating knowledge of marketing alternatives; and encouraging better linkages between \nproducers, processors, and traders of animals and animal products. The project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA) will assess the distribution of benefits to different categories of men and women farmers and demonstrate how \nproject benefits will accrue disproportionately to the poor. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis    Proposed Classification:  Core Poverty Intervention \n                                                                                                                   Gender and Development \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe proposed Project will cover 56 districts (including 8 pilot hill districts) and all five development regions. Poverty is \nwidespread with an estimated 42% of the population below the poverty line. Farms have an average size of less than \n1 hectare and are highly fragmented and scattered, creating difficulties in the efficient use of land and farm labor. A \nconsiderable portion (up to 17%) of cropped land is leased by landless tenants or is under mixed tenancy. Poverty is \nwidespread and is exacerbated in pockets, particularly in the hills but also in the terai, and among ethnic minorities \nand occupational caste groups. Men migrate in search of work, leaving women as the primary decision maker at both \nhousehold and farm levels, especially among low-income households. Consumption per capita in the lowest decile, \nperhaps best captures the magnitude and intensity of poverty. The poorest allocate 69% of total expenditures to food, \n16 percentage points more than those in the highest decile. Malnutrition is prevalent among the poor and involves not ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nonly caloric deprivation but also serious deficiencies in proteins and micronutrients such as betacarotene, calcium, \niron, and iodine. Thus, the poor are prone to nutritional disorders and have low overall productivity. Household food \nshortages and unemployment remain major risks to the majority of the people. The TA will assess movements in and \nout of poverty for a clearer understanding of how rural households structure their livelihoods and income base with \nboth farm and nonfarm activities. The extent of households' dependence on rural and urban sources of income and \nthe nature of risk management will need to be assessed and elements of pro-poor growth identified for incorporation \ninto the project design. \n \nOverall, women head 10% of households, with the Western Region having the highest proportion (19%) of female \nheads of households and the Midwestern Region the lowest (3%). Poor women lack the means and the opportunity to \nchallenge customary conventions. They are difficult to reach and hard to organize into groups as they have higher \nopportunity  costs  and  less  capacity  to  wait  for  investment  payoffs.  Efforts  to  reach  women  with  inputs  and \ngovernment services have had little impact on women's incomes. All too often, programs have focused on training for \nincome-generating activities that are low paying, less productive, and low in demand. As a result, women remain \nconfined to traditional activities. Only a small proportion of women\u2019s groups have been trained in improved livestock \ncare or provided with inputs to pursue these activities profitably. Among the poor, especially the landless, women \nshare the income-earning responsibility with men. Therefore, women's income is essential for households to have an \nacceptable level of food security. The Project will ensure that poor women participate in livestock groups (women\u2019s \ngroups and mixed gender groups) and will build their organizational capacity. The Project will assess the social \ncapital of farmer groups and organizations, and identify the need for organizational strengthening and capacity \nbuilding for better servicing of their members and to increase their capability to be self-reliant. Employment \nopportunities  will  be  increased  by  commercializing  livestock  production  and  developing  processing  and \nagribusinesses. The results are reduction of poverty and of the need for men to migrate to seek employment, and \npositive impacts for women and children. \n \nThe Project will identify impoverished areas in the project districts and conduct needs assessments to ensure that \ndisadvantaged groups receive equal opportunities to participate in project activities. In addition, the nature of farming \npractices will be assessed; and the size, fragmentation of farmland, the pattern of land usage, and patterns in \nlivestock ownership and uses will be determined. This information will be used to (i) ensure that project benefits \naccrue to men and women farmers and other disadvantaged groups; (ii) identify and recommend support for \nmechanisms to link resource-rich areas with resource-poor areas; and (iii) identify strategies to improve marketing of \nagricultural products especially by poor, illiterate farmers and women, and the dissemination of market information. \nPoverty and gender considerations will form an integral part of the project design. \n \nC.

Selected stakeholder representatives will form an advisory group at the beginning of the fieldwork \nto work closely with the consultants. The Project will apply participatory planning approaches involving stakeholders \nin a continuous participatory planning process of workshops and working groups so that the project design will \nrepresent a consensus by representatives of all stakeholders, especially poor women and smallholder farmers, the \nmain beneficiaries. Two major workshops will be conducted, one at the beginning of the fieldwork and the other at the \nend of the fieldwork to consolidate views and recommendations for project design. \n \nD.            Gender \n \nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women \n \nWomen play a major role in managing and taking care of livestock, contributing 70% of work related to livestock \nraising. Livestock rearing has the potential for generating sustained and profitable employment for women and poor \nmen, and will be promoted in a manner that raises productivity and profits. The proposed Project builds on the gender \nmainstreaming strategy of the ongoing Third Livestock Development Project that has successfully increased women\u2019s \nparticipation to 46%, the majority of whom were decision makers in their groups. The proposed Project has a specific \ncomponent on community mobilization and gender integration and has allocated sufficient resources to secure its \nintegration, 2.5 person-months each for a gender specialist, and a poverty reduction and social/NGO specialist. The \nTA will ensure that women have a central role in the activities intended to improve animal production, productivity, and \nhousehold incomes. Eligibility and selection criteria and special support (services, training, input supply including \n ", "8  Appendix 1 \naccess to credit) will be built into the Project to expand women\u2019s opportunities to participate in project activities. The \nTA will assess gender capacity building needs of the executing agency (central and field staff), concerned district line \nagencies, such as the Women Development Office and local governance structures, and identify policy reform needed \nto institutionalize the gender mainstreaming process in the Department of Livestock Services. \n \nOutput Prepared \n \nThe proposed Project seeks 50% participation of women in all project activities. The TA will prepare a plan to integrate \ngender concerns into the overall project design and develop monitoring indicators to assess differential impacts on \nmen and women. The high-altitude pilot project proposed for 8 districts in the Midwestern and Far Western regions is \ncharacterized by transhumance livestock practices. Little work has been undertaken to understand these livestock-\nfarming systems. Therefore, the TA will assess gender issues and identify strategies to address gender concerns for \nlarge-scale replication. \n \nE.
