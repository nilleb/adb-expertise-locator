INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  countries1 address  challenges  posed  by  the  coronavirus \ndisease  (COVID-19)  and  support  economic  revival  using  information  and  communication \ntechnologies (ICTs) and digital technologies. The TA will support the following activities: (i) \nimplementing CAREC initiatives on digital transformation, and (ii) supporting startup ecosystem \ndevelopment in the CAREC region. These activities will be implemented through capacity building, \npolicy advice, and research and development. \n \n2.  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on the global economy. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) aims to support the public and private sectors in improving \nthe environment for post-pandemic recovery.2 In these challenging times, fostering innovation has \nbecome  critical  to  mitigating  the  impact  of  the  pandemic  and  achieving  inclusive  and \nenvironmentally sustainable recovery and growth.3 Within the region, the CAREC 2030 strategy \nconsiders the integration of ICTs across CAREC operations as a crosscutting priority.4 Digital \ntransformation  of  CAREC  into  a  virtual  platform  will  strengthen  policy  development  and \ncoordination. A startup ecosystem will generate technical and financial opportunities for emerging \nenterprises that help reinvigorate the economies of CAREC members. The TA will complement \nongoing work under ADB\u2019s technical assistance for Implementing the CAREC 2030 Strategy for \nSustainable Regional Development.5 The TA promotes the use of innovative technology and is \naligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities (OP) of accelerating progress in gender \nequality (OP 2), strengthening governance and institutional capacity (OP 6) and fostering regional \ncooperation and integration (OP 7).6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting measures implemented by governments \nworldwide, ranging from social or physical distancing and movement restrictions to full lockdowns, \nhave brought about immediate social, behavioral, economic, political, and technological shifts. \nEconomically, domestic output levels are expected to decline because of containment measures.7 \nThe CAREC region\u2019s gross domestic product is expected to grow at 1.6% in 2020 (although this \nfigure is \u20131.3% if the People\u2019s Republic of China [PRC] is excluded). The severity of the slowdown \nis varied across member countries. Growth rate forecasts for 2020 have been revised downwards \nacross the board, with the PRC expected to grow the fastest at 1.8% and the Kyrgyz Republic \nbearing the largest contraction at \u201310% (footnote 7). \n \n4.  CAREC countries were not spared by disruptions in global and regional links affecting \ntheir supply chains, tourism, remittances, and other economic activities. Hotels, resorts, and \n \n1  The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program is a partnership of 11 member countries \n(Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, \nPakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) and development partners working to promote development \nthrough cooperation, leading to accelerated economic growth and shared prosperity. \n2  ADB. 2020.

Education and learning have been forced to shift to \nonline or to blended learning, with issues raised about subsequent quality and effectiveness. \nSimilarly, other important service delivery activities, such as telephone health services, that have \nadopted remote work or work-from-home practices face challenges in terms of maintaining the \nsame levels of efficiency and accuracy. These changes are foreseen to have longer term \nimplications and will usher in a \u201cnew normal\u201d in terms of food and nutrition, health and wellness, \neducation and training, work practices, governance, civic participation, transportation and logistics, \nand banking and financial management, among others. Technology will play a significant role in \nthe revival and diversification of economies in the post-pandemic period.  \n \n5.   For CAREC, the travel restrictions and protocols on physical distancing have reduced the \nprogram\u2019s activities scheduled for 2020. Under these circumstances, ICTs can facilitate the \nestablishment  of  virtual  platforms  to  continue  advancing  CAREC\u2019s  objectives  on  regional \ncooperation. \n \n6.  The TA will build upon and leverage ongoing bilateral8 and regional9 initiatives in ICT and \ndigital  technologies  being  implemented  by  ADB,  individual  CAREC  countries,10 and  other \ndevelopment partners.11 Stronger collaboration on these initiatives, particularly the ADB Ventures \nFacility,12 will be promoted. \n \n7.  CAREC member countries vary in their openness and policy environment for promoting \ninnovation and business activity, which might hinder the creation of startups and adoption of digital \ninnovations. The Global Innovation Index 202013 and Doing Business Rankings14 show a high \nvariance for CAREC countries, with some members performing relatively well, such as the PRC \n(in 14th position on the Global Innovation Index) and Georgia (seventh position in the Doing \nBusiness Ranking) and others lagging significantly, such as Tajikistan (109th on the Global \nInnovation Index) and Afghanistan (173rd in the Doing Business Ranking). \n \n8.  CAREC countries also vary in their levels of adoption and use of ICT solutions.15 However, \nthey have all embarked on pursuing ICT or digital strategies, starting with modernizing their \ntelecommunications infrastructure. They are ready to take advantage of the increased and \n \n8  ADB bilateral initiatives include (i) ADB. Azerbaijan: Fostering Development of Local Tech Startups, (ii) ADB. \nKazakhstan: Promoting Digital Technologies for Sustainable Development, (iii) ADB. Pakistan: Integrated Information \nand Communications Technology Development Project, and (iv) ADB.

Startups attract talent and funding, catalyze local innovation, \nand create jobs. At the same time, they help transform economies by driving innovation and \ncollaboration with traditional sectors to increase productivity and competitiveness  of legacy \nsystems,  and  by  creating  jobs.  Regional  collaboration  in  developing  conducive  startup \necosystems for entrepreneurs, talents, enablers, and funders can help promote knowledge \nsharing and best practices in crisis response.  \n \n9.  The difficulties that countries face in harnessing the potential of ICTs are caused by the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Inadequate internet connectivity and limited access to latest technologies. Except \nfor  the  PRC,  most  CAREC  countries  generally  have  weak  telecommunications \ninfrastructure,  accentuated  by  large  rural\u2013urban  gaps  in  ICT  access.  This  lag  in \nconnectivity can be partially explained by unavoidable geographic constraints. Some of \nthe countries are landlocked or have extremely mountainous or desert terrain, which \nmeans they rely on neighboring countries to reach the network and don\u2019t have direct \nsubmarine cable access.16 In addition, investments by both governments and the private \nsector in promoting ICT integration have remained limited. The TA will address these \nchallenges by identifying and highlighting them through advocacy and policy dialogue.  \n \n(ii)  Shortage  of  support  programs  to  promote  information  and  communication \ntechnology and digital technology initiatives. Beyond infrastructure gaps, the lack of \nICT and digital technology development is mostly a result of institutional factors, such as \nthe lack of a conducive regulatory framework and policies that encourage investment and \npromote innovation throughout the digital value chain. Weak links between startups, \nprivate technology companies, and investors hinder countries from realizing potential \ninnovative solutions to address the challenges posed by COVID-19. While developing \nthe ICT industry is one of the key strategic priorities for CAREC countries, venture \ninvestment and startup ecosystems are in their early stage of formation.  Domestic \nmarkets in the region are often too small for startups to reach scale, making regional \ncollaboration and integration through e-commerce, for example, a key enabler. Enhanced \nregional collaboration to exchange information and best practices would contribute to \nreduce knowledge gaps and spurring economic growth in the region. \n \n10.  These barriers have hindered development and economic growth in the CAREC countries, \nand indicate that the underutilized potential of ICTs, if tapped, would contribute to reactivating \neconomies and help countries mitigate the disruptions caused by COVID-19. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.

Output 1: CAREC initiatives on digital transformation implemented. The TA will \nsupport the digital integration of CAREC countries through (i) assessing current integration of \ndigital  technologies  and  ICT  in  member  countries  and  through  CAREC  clusters,  and  (ii) \ndeveloping a CAREC digital strategy 2030. The TA will assess, identify, and provide new digital \nmechanisms, tools, and necessary equipment to facilitate virtual dialogue and enable remote \ncollaboration and information exchange among CAREC countries. These efforts will feed into the \ndevelopment of the CAREC digital strategy 2030. This strategy will set out a vision and a plan \ntowards  2030,  in  alignment  with  CAREC  2030  and  the  technological  priorities  of  member \ncountries. The strategy will discuss concrete measures to effectively integrate ICT across CAREC \noperational clusters and will ensure continuity of other initiatives under CAREC 2030. The CAREC \nHackathon Concept Note19 includes illustrative digital opportunities under each cluster. In addition, \nthis TA will provide support to member country governments to increase their capacity to address \nregional technical and legal challenges so as to promote increased use of digital technologies to \nmitigate the direct social and economic impacts of COVID-19. \n \n13.  Output 2: Startup ecosystem development for CAREC countries supported. The TA \nwill support CAREC countries in developing startup ecosystems at the country or regional level \nby establishing a CAREC startup ecosystem development hub and organizing \u201copen innovation \nchallenges\u201d. The CAREC startup ecosystem development hub is a virtual platform that will \nharness innovative ideas and digital solutions to address problems posed by the COVID-19 \npandemic and contribute to the economic recovery of the CAREC countries. The hub will provide \ncapacity building to key stakeholders including government officials, financial institutions, startups, \nincubators, accelerators, and universities. The hub will also act as a broker in establishing \neffective partnerships through investor meet-ups and pitch sessions, among others, and will \nfacilitate dialogue and networking between startups from different countries, and between startups \nand additional funds and investors, such as the ADB Ventures Facility (footnote 12). The TA will \nconduct open innovation challenges, aimed at gathering innovative ideas and solutions to specific \nregional challenges in transition to a post-COVID-19 era (footnote 19). The TA will provide \nsponsorship funds to winners of these challenges to further develop and expand their respective \ninitiatives. The TA will also facilitate transfer of knowledge and partnerships between private and \npublic initiatives, and global centers of innovation and startup excellence from the PRC, the \nRepublic of Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, European countries, the United Arab Emirates, \nand the United States. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.0 million, of which (i) $0.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), and (ii) $0.5 million will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund \nand administered by ADB.
