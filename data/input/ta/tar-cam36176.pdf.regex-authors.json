In  2002,  the  Government  of  Cambodia  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare a project to improve social and natural environmental \nconditions related to boat landing facilities, social infrastructure, and related community services \nat Chong Kneas on the border of the Tonle Sap lake in Siem Reap province. During 19 August \n\u2013 6 September 2002, ADB fielded a Fact-Finding Mission, which met with relevant government \nagencies and key stakeholders, including potential beneficiaries, as well as representatives of \nthe  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization;  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization; International Labour Organisation; and World Food Programme.1 The Mission \nreached an understanding with the Government on the goal, purpose, scope, implementation \narrangements, cost estimates, and financing plan for the TA, and on the terms of reference for \nthe consultants. The TA is part of the Tonle Sap initiative, a program of assistance conceived for \nsustainable management and conservation of natural resources and biodiversity in the Tonle \nSap Basin. The TA is included in ADB's 2002 program for Cambodia.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Chong Kneas, a fishing community at the northern end of the Tonle Sap in Siem Reap \nProvince, is the major landing point for fish, cargo, passengers, and fuel destined for Siem \nReap.3 It is interconnected with other landing sites around the perimeter of the lake and with \nPhnom Penh via the Tonle Sap River. The largest user of boat transport at Chong Kneas is the \nfishing industry. There is also a rapidly growing boat service bringing tourists from Phnom Penh \nto Siem Reap and Angkor Wat. \n \n3.  Chong  Kneas  consists  of  seven  villages  of  mixed  ethnic  composition,  with  a  total \npopulation of about 5,000 in some 700 households. As with other fishing communities in the \nflooded  area  of  the  lake,  the  Chong  Kneas  community  has  adopted  a  way  of  life  tightly \nintegrated with the seasonal rise and fall of water in the Tonle Sap. The inhabitants of six of the \nseven villages live in houseboats, which are moved according to the water level. The remaining \nvillage lives on the side of a road embankment that extends south from Phnom Kraom, an \nisolated rocky outcrop rising about 140 meters above the otherwise flat terrain of the seasonally \nflooded land bordering the Tonle Sap. Phnom Kraom is a site of cultural and commercial \nsignificance and is linked with Siem Reap to its north by a 12 kilometer (km) all-weather, asphalt \nroad. When the water level in the Tonle Sap is high, the commune of Chong Kneas clusters at \nthe base of Phnom Kraom.4 In the dry season, the floating villages of Chong Kneas anchor in a \nsmall inlet on the perimeter of the lake where there is ready access to fishing grounds and some \nprotection from storms and waves. \n                                                 \n1  The  Mission  comprised  I.  Fox  (Principal  Project  Specialist/Mission  Leader),  M.  Mitra  (Social  Development \nSpecialist),  O.  Serrat  (Sr.  Project  Economist),  C.S.  Chandrasekhar  (Ports  and  Infrastructure  Engineer/staff \nconsultant),  E.  Horstia  (Institutional  Specialist/staff  consultant),  H.  Pelkonen  (Environment  Specialist/staff \nconsultant), T. Wrigley (Environment Specialist/Sanitation Engineer/staff consultant), and Kan Vibol (Workshop \nFacilitator). The Mission was also assisted by A. Jude, P. Van Im, R. Keo, and N. Ouk of ADB's Cambodia \nResident Mission. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in April 2002. \n3  Although there are no reliable statistical data on boat operations, the scale of current traffic may be judged by the \nfact that there are 414 motorized and 876 nonmotorized boats registered at Chong Kneas. \n4  On average, the lowest level of the lake is 1.1 meters (m) above mean sea level (amsl) and the average peak level \nis 9.7 m amsl. The surface area of the lake increases from 250,000 hectares (ha) in the dry season to about 1.25 \nmillion ha in the wet season. During the floods of 2000, the level of the lake peaked at 11.75 m amsl. ", "2   \n \n4.  Formal port facilities do not exist at Chong Kneas due in large part to the seasonal water \nlevel variation and corresponding movement of the shoreline by some 5-8 km.5 The present \nfacilities  for  the  offloading  of  fish,  cargo,  and  passengers  comprise  an  earthen  road \nembankment  extending  south  from  Phnom  Kraom  for  a  distance  of  about  3.8  km  and  a \nnavigation channel of about 6 km total length that runs alongside the road and connects to the \nsmall inlet on the lake\u2019s perimeter. When the lake is at its highest level, Phnom Kraom is \naccessible by fishing, cargo, and passenger boats, even though the road is mostly submerged. \nIn the dry season, the channel is unnavigable for almost its complete length. At such times, a \nmakeshift landing site is established at the point where the road ends. This and other similar \ninstallations along the road are removed as the water rises. The channel is often heavily \ncongested, with regular traffic sharing the narrow passage with floating houses, fish cages being \ntowed from one location to another, and tourist boats in a chaotic manner. Passengers and \ncargo reach the boats via planks supported on temporary supports. The site is hazardous for \npassengers, unhygienic for fish handling, and susceptible to oil and fuel spills. The air is fetid \nwith rotting organic detritus. Nonbiodegradable solid waste litters the shoreline and shallow \nwaters. Liquid and solid wastes of all nature are disposed of in the water alongside the road and \nbecome trapped within the channel.6 Although the visual evidence of pollution diminishes when \nthe water level is high, the environmental and health hazards remain. This situation poses an \nincreasingly severe health risk for the villages of Chong Kneas, limits the opportunities for value-\nadded fish-based activities, and is not conducive to tourism development.7  \n \n5.  While fishing is the main occupation, small businesses and employment as porters, boat \ndrivers, and fish handlers provide some supplementary income. The inhabitants of the floating \nvillages pay to have their houseboats towed to new anchorage sites along the channel to \naccommodate the changing water levels and move into sheltered locations. These and other \ncosts  related  to  repairing  damage  to  their  houses  account  for  a  large  part  of  the  annual \nexpenditure of the predominantly poor residents.8 Indebtedness is high, and returns for labor \nare low, as most poor fishers are locked into a system of borrowing and selling to middlemen. \nThe absence of clean water and sanitation leads to frequent morbidity and low levels of life \nexpectancy. One floating school is in poor condition and provides extremely limited facilities.9 \nSeasonal peaks in labor demand result in low school attendance, especially for boys. \n \n6.  The most vulnerable section of the community, however, consists of female-headed \nhouseholds, for which lack of access to male labor and capital severely limits livelihood options. \nAnother particularly vulnerable group is the ethnic minority population of Vietnamese. There are \na total of 187 such households with a population of 1,477. The small Cham community of 36 \nfamilies, while also extremely poor, is less subject to discriminatory actions and is therefore \nmore readily accepted into community fisheries organizations. \n                                                 \n5  These transient conditions and the mildly sloping ground surface preclude shoreline development in the absence of \nmajor excavation and filling. \n6  Flushing of the channel cannot take place, and dilution of accumulated pollutants does not occur until the water \nlevel is sufficiently high to connect at all points of the channel with the general body of water in the lake. \n7  Siem Reap has undergone a tourism boom since the restoration of peace in Cambodia. Some 430,000 tourists \narrived by air in 2001, and the number of tourists arriving annually is predicted to double by 2006. Siem Reap\u2019s \nairport terminal facilities are being upgraded to cater to 2.6 million passengers per year. Although the number of \ntourists accessing Siem Reap via Chong Kneas is presently low, their numbers have also steadily increased. In \n2001, 28,000 passengers passed through Chong Kneas, of whom 8-10% were foreigners. The absence of \nadequate boat landing facilities prevents Chong Kneas from becoming a more important point of entry to Siem \nReap for inland tourists. \n8  Almost 60% of the population are below the poverty line, defined as the per capita expenditure needed to secure \nan intake of 2,100 calories per day. \n9  There are also educational facilities established under nongovernment organization-financed literacy campaigns. \n   ", "  3\n                     \n \n \n7.  Improvement of environmental conditions and reduction of poverty for the community at \nChong Kneas are interrelated and strongly linked with improvement of living conditions for the \ndependent community. Their life on the water is one of extreme hardship and vulnerability. The \ncommunity has requested that upgrading of the port facilities be accompanied by the provision \nof a permanent living area for the commune of Chong Kneas.10 Resettlement of the floating \nvillages into houses on reclaimed land will facilitate the provision of clean water and sanitation, \ntogether with a range of other social services and facilities hitherto denied to this community. \nManagement of an improved port by a competent and legally constituted harbor authority will \ncomplement such enhanced living conditions and help ensure observance of better waste \ndisposal and other environmental safeguards. These measures at Chong Kneas will draw the \ninterface of human settlement with the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) further from the \nlake, eliminate sources of pollution, and create favorable conditions in support of the Tonle Sap \ninitiative. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to prepare an investment project to improve the social and \nnatural environment at Chong Kneas. The main deliverable of the TA is a feasibility study of \ninvestment interventions. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 7.5 months. As an initial activity, the \nconsultants  will  be  required  to  undertake  detailed  social,  environmental,  and  institutional \nanalyses to resolve any outstanding concerns from previous studies.11 12 To ensure that the \nneeds and preferences of the affected persons are incorporated in project design, reference will \nbe made to the summary initial poverty and social analysis (Appendix 1). The TA will prepare a \nproject for creation of a harbor and township sited on a flood-free platform built from earth. The \nrequisite landfill will be obtained from excavation to deepen and widen the existing navigation \nchannel and to form a new harbor with year-round access for boats to the lake. The optimum \nsite for the platform (between the lake shore and Phnom Kraom) will be decided upon on the \nbasis of social, environmental, and economic studies under the TA. The new township will \nincorporate a subdivided housing area, drinking water supply, sanitation, roads, and adequate \nland for schools, clinics, and other social infrastructure.13 Issues of land title and compensation \npayments  will  be  thoroughly  studied  during  TA  implementation  to  arrive  at  principles  and \nstandards for resettlement that are acceptable to both the Government and ADB. \n                                                 \n10 At the stakeholder workshop held in Siem Reap on 26 August 2002, all participants, representing a broad cross- \nsection of the inhabitants of Chong Kneas, expressed a strong desire to move into houses on flood-free land. \n11 UNDP/MRC. 1998.

Technical Assistance for the Protection and Management of Critical Wetlands in the Lower Mekong \nBasin. Manila. The TA further assessed the feasibility of upgraded infrastructure at Chong Kneas and Chhnok \nTrou. \n13 All current residents of Chong Kneas will be eligible for house lots under the Project. The Government will \nundertake a census of residents of Chong Kneas prior to commencement of the TA to establish eligibility. \n   ", "4   \n \n10.  The harbor will incorporate separate berthing and unloading facilities for fish, cargo, fuel, \nand passengers, together with mooring for passenger, cargo, and fishing boats belonging to \nChong Kneas (but not houseboats). Inherent in the project concept is the resettlement of Chong \nKneas houseboat dwellers in fixed houses on dry land to achieve effective and sustainable \nimprovements in living conditions. Accordingly, the existing road embankment leading toward \nthe lake from Phnom Kraom will be removed under the project, and raised embankments will \nnot be provided along the navigation channel.14 The consultants will prepare a feasibility study \nfor the investment and formulate a project for possible funding by ADB. \n \n11.  Key  activities  will  include  (i)  review  of  available  data;  (ii)  environmental  impact \nassessment of the proposed works; (iii) in-depth socioeconomic studies to determine likely \nimpacts of the proposed improvements on different stakeholders including illegal users of the \nflooded forest, develop mechanisms for stakeholder participation, and prepare ethnic minorities \ndevelopment and resettlement plans for the inhabitants of Chong Kneas; (iv) preparation of \nrecommendations for regulatory and institutional reform and formulation of a capacity-building \naction plan; (v) development of an appropriate institutional structure for management of Chong \nKneas  township  and  harbor,  together  with  organizational  arrangements  and  definition  of \nresponsibilities for the Tonle Sap Harbor Management Authority (TSHMA);15 (vi) projections of \ngrowth  in  boat  traffic  and  commercial  use  of  port  facilities  at  Chong  Kneas,  considering \nconcurrent development of transport alternatives (Highways Nos. 5 and 6); (vii) formulation of a \ndevelopment layout for Chong Kneas township and harbor, encompassing adequate provision \nfor staged implementation and future expansion; (viii) formulation of strategies to improve water \nsupply; waste management; sanitation; storage and handling of dangerous materials; control of \ndust,  noise,  and  smell;  and  site  management  (especially  in  relation  to  means  of  avoiding \nentrapment  of  pollutants  within  the  navigation  channel);  (ix)  formulation  of  proposals  for \nensuring financial sustainability; and (x) feasibility study design of the proposed improvements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,180,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $754,000 and a local currency cost of $426,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $997,000 equivalent, including the entire foreign exchange cost \nand $243,000 equivalent of local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Finland. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, \nequivalent to $183,000, largely through the provision of office accommodation, remuneration \nand per diem of counterpart staff, undertaking topographic surveys and a population census, \nprovision of data and maps, and the holding of workshops. Details of the cost estimate and \nfinancing plan are shown in Appendix 2. The Government has been advised that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n(MPWT). MPWT will ensure financial support for the TA, assign experienced staff to serve as \nfull-time  counterparts  to  the  consultants,  provide  office  facilities  and  local  transport,  and \ncoordinate the participation of relevant agencies at the national and provincial levels.16 A project \n                                                 \n14 The provision of raised embankments would encourage a continuation of the present, environmentally damaging \npattern of living, and might also encourage immigration of houseboat dwellers from other parts of the lake. \n15 It is anticipated that advisory TA will be provided in association with any ensuing loan to build the capacity of \nTSHMA. The consultants will design the advisory TA as part of the study. \n16 MPWT will work closely with the Cambodia National Mekong Committee and the Secretariat of TSBR. \n   ", "  5\n                     \n \nmanagement office will be established for the duration of TA implementation, consisting of a \nproject  director  appointed  by  MPWT,  and  representatives  of  the  Siem  Reap  provincial \ngovernment, including the provincial departments of fisheries, forestry, and environment. \n \n14.  The TA is expected to commence in February 2003 and to be completed in September \n2003. It will include 38 person-months of domestic consulting expertise and 33 person-months \nof international consulting expertise to be recruited through a firm. Consultants will work under \nthe  guidance  and  supervision  of  the  project  management  office.  They  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants, using the quality and cost-\nbased selection method and full technical proposals. The international consultants will have \nexpertise in (i) development planning, 7.5 person-months; (ii) water supply and sanitation, 4 \nperson-months; (iii) social analysis and resettlement, 4.5 person-months; (iv) environmental \nanalysis, 5 person-months; (v) institutional analysis, 3.5 person-months; (vi) civil engineering \n(with  specialization  in  ports  and  related  facilities),  5.5  person-months;  and  (vii)  project \neconomics, 3 person-months. The domestic consultants will have expertise in (i) environmental \nimpact  assessment,  6.5  person-months;  (ii)  rural  sociology,  6.5  person-months;  (iii)  town \nplanning, 3 person-months; (iv) water supply and sanitation, 5.5 person-months; (v) legal and \ninstitutional  aspects,  4  person-months,  (vi)  project  performance  management;  1.5  person-\nmonths; (vii) geotechnical engineering, 3.5 person-months; (viii) civil and structural engineering \ndesign, 6 person-months; and (ix) cost estimating/contracts engineering, 1.5 person-months. An \nindicative staffing schedule is shown in Appendix 3, and outline terms of reference are given in \nAppendix 4. \n \n15.  The consultants will produce an inception report at the end of the first month and a draft \nfinal report at the end of month 7. The Government's and ADB's comments on the draft final \nreport will be incorporated into the final report, to be submitted by mid-month 8. MPWT will, for \nits part, fill out a TA completion questionnaire to evaluate the TA\u2019s inputs and outputs, identify \nlessons learned, and suggest follow-up actions. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $997,000 to the Government \nof Cambodia to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Finland for preparing the \nChong Kneas Environmental Improvement Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.\n   ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nSector  identified  as  a  National  Priority  in  Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority in  Yes \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   Country  Poverty  Partnership \n  Agreement?  \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: The Tonle Sap provides about two thirds \nof the total animal protein consumed in Cambodia, and approximately 15% of the country\u2019s population is \ndependent on it for their livelihood. About 175 floating communities live on the Tonle Sap and derive their \nlivelihood mainly through fishing, supplemented by harvesting products of the flooded forest. The Tonle Sap \nRiver and lake provide important transportation routes not only for the floating communities but for a host of \nusers including the fishing industry, which is the largest user of boat transport. Passengers and tourists travel \nto the province of Siem Reap and its famous historical sites, including the Angkor Wat temples. Chong Kneas \nis the only landing site for fish, cargo, passengers, and fuel destined for Siem Reap. Chong Kneas and its \nsurrounding area are used by poor floating communities and by land-based communities living in and around \nit. Floating communities and poor residents on land suffer from very high levels of poverty: approximately 60% \nof the population survive on incomes of less than $0.50 per capita per day. They suffer deprivation from \naccess to basic social infrastructure and services, health hazards, and poor levels of education. Such \ncommunities are characterized by the widespread use of child labor, exposure to natural disasters, food \ninsecurity, and high costs associated with repeated moving of homes in keeping with changes in the water \nlevel in the lake. Poverty is thus associated with poor environmental conditions in the area and its vicinity, low \nincomes, lack of secure housing conditions, access to minimum social services, lack of access to institutional \nfinancing, and lack of direct access to markets. At the stakeholder workshop organized as part of the \nTechnical Assistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission, it came out clearly that the poor inhabitants of the area want \nto  move  from  their  floating  villages  to  housing  on  flood-free  land.  They  expect  that  the  proposed \nimprovements at the Chong Kneas boat landing site will bring about direct reduction of poverty and hardship \nthrough provision of secure permanent housing on land, assistance with house construction, access to basic \namenities, training and education in hygiene and health care, and access to improved education and health \nfacilities. Organization and capacity building of local communities are expected to lead to greater participation \nin poverty reduction programs through training and skill building, provision of revolving funds for improved \nlivelihoods, and direct access to markets. Provision will be made for the full participation of vulnerable groups \nsuch as female-headed households. Ethnic minorities, particularly of Vietnamese origin, are vulnerable to \nsocial exclusion and denial of access to amenities. The Project will ensure that equitable treatment is provided \nto the Vietnamese community born in Cambodia and living and working in Chong Kneas, in terms of their full \nparticipation in improved housing, and access to social services and improved livelihoods. Full opportunities \nwill be provided to them to participate in project planning, design, implementation, and monitoring and \nevaluation. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nSocioeconomic surveys and poverty reduction interventions will be carried out under the TA to ensure that \nbaseline profiles of the communities are prepared for future impact assessment. Participatory approaches will \nbe required to understand the determinants and characteristics of poverty and vulnerability, and thereby \ndetermine appropriate project interventions aimed at reducing poverty and vulnerability. This will enable the \nProject to develop strategies for building the capacity of the socially marginalized sections to participate fully \nin the project activities and benefits. \n \nC.  Participation Process  \n \nDuring TA implementation, participatory approaches will be used to involve the residents of Chong Kneas and \nother users of the project area facilities and related resources in the project design process. The objective will  \n   ", "    Appendix  1  7\n \nbe to determine present patterns and levels of use and activity, likely impacts of the Project on different \ngroups  of  users  and  their  activities,  and  people\u2019s  views  and  preferences  related  to  project  design, \nimplementation, management, monitoring, and evaluation. The methods to be used include group meetings, \nvillage mapping, transect walks, wealth ranking, and priority ranking. Participatory workshops will be held \nduring the TA to determine the views of affected groups. Separate discussions will be held with poor women, \nespecially female headed households, and ethnic minority groups, particularly those of Vietnamese origin, to \nunderstand their particular needs and constraints and to formulate appropriate ways to incorporate their views \nand wishes into project planning and design. Mechanisms for sustained participation by all sections of \nstakeholders will be identified through participatory consultations with the provincial authorities, commune \ncouncil, village chiefs, affected households, female-headed households, and ethnic minority communities. \nStakeholder Analysis.

Potential Issues \n  Degree of    Plan \nItem  Significance  Strategy to Address Issues  Required \n \nResettlement  Significant  A  full-scale  socioeconomic  survey  will  be  carried  out  to  Full \nprovide baseline data regarding the affected groups prior to \nthe  Project,  and  to  identify  their  views  and  preferences. \nParticipatory methods will be used to develop resettlement \nplans  based  upon  solutions  agreed  upon  with  the \nGovernment and affected groups. An RP will be prepared in \naccordance with the Asian Development Bank's Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement.  \nGender   Significant  Women constitute a major user group of the resources of the  Yes \n  Tonle  Sap  and  are  major  stakeholders  in  Chong  Kneas. \n  Female-headed  households  constitute  approximately  24\u2013\n30% of all households in the project area and are among the \npoorest  and  most  vulnerable.  They  lack  opportunities  to \nparticipate  in  public  decision  making  and  lack  access  to \nresources. They require specific actions aimed at ensuring \nequal opportunities to participate in project planning, design, \nand implementation, and to access project benefits.  \nAffordability  Uncertain  Issues  of  affordability  of  house  construction  costs  and  Yes \n  financial  contribution  to  port  charges,  operation  and \n  maintenance  of  port  facilities,  use  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation services, etc. need to be studied during project \npreparation. \n \nLabor  None    None \nIndigenous  Significant  Ethnic minority communities such as the Khmer Islam or  Yes \nPeople   Cham  and  Vietnamese  live  in  Chong  Kneas.  These \n  communities live by fishing alone and are totally dependent \nupon the resources of the Tonle Sap for subsistence.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Executing Agency for the technical assistance (TA) is the Ministry of Public Works \nand Transport (MPWT), which will establish a project management office in Siem Reap to \nadminister the TA and provide day-to-day guidance to the consultants. The project management \noffice will be headed by a Project Director appointed by MPWT, and will include representatives \nof  the  Siem  Reap  provincial  government  as  members.  The  project  area  comprises  the \ncommunes of Chong Kneas and Phnom Kraom in Siem Reap Province, together with the \nresources over which these communes have tenure or rights of access. \n \n2.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 7.5 months, and is to be conducted within \nthe overall framework and guidelines established under the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \nTonle Sap Environmental Management Project.1 Specific reference will be made to prefeasibility \nstudies for infrastructure improvements at Chong Kneas and Chhnok Trou (Kompong Chhnang \nProvince) made in 1998 by the Mekong River Commission Secretariat in cooperation with the \nUnited Nations Development Programme.2 The consultants will also examine and review the \nfindings from ADB's regional TA for Protection and Management of Critical Wetlands in the \nLower Mekong Basin.3 \n \n3.  To  ensure  that  the  needs  and  preferences  of  the  affected  persons  (APs)  are \nincorporated in the project design, the consultants will undertake detailed social, environmental, \nand institutional analyses. Critical activities are preparation and joint Government/ADB approval \nof (i) environmental impact assessment (EIA) and summary EIA reports; (ii) resettlement plan; \nand (iii) ethnic minority development plan (EMDP). Any necessary institutional and regulatory \nreforms will be formulated in consultation with the relevant government agencies. \n \n4.  The Department of Public Works and Transport (DPWT) in Siem Reap Province will \nfinance topographical and bathymetrical surveys to facilitate feasibility design of the proposed \nworks. Other surveys and investigations that will be needed for the study, including (i) EIA; (ii) \nsocial assessment and resettlement surveys; and (iii) geotechnical investigations, will be directly \nmanaged by the consultants. The consultants will prepare terms of reference, specifications, \nimplementation  schedules,  and  draft  contracts  for  these,  and  will  supervise  their \nimplementation. On a day-to-day basis, the consultants will work closely with DPWT, and they \nwill liaise with staff of the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction \n(MLMUPC) for matters dealing with zoning for housing, land titling, and boundary demarcation.4 \nRepresentatives  of  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve  (TSBR)  Secretariat,  Mekong  River \nCommission, and other relevant agencies will also be consulted.5 \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Initial Activities \n \n5.  The consultants will compile relevant available data and prepare an inventory of current \nconditions based on site visits and a review of existing data.6 A representative sample of \npotential beneficiaries and others who may be affected by proposed works will be interviewed to \nhelp design social surveys. \n \n6.  The initial activities will culminate in the preparation of the inception report describing the \npreliminary findings and presenting recommendations for any revisions considered necessary in \nthe work plan. An overview of the methodology proposed to be used for economic and financial \nevaluation  of  port  improvement  (including  environmental  benefits)  will  be  provided  in  the \ninception report. A tripartite meeting will be held to review the inception report. \n \nC.  Environmental Impact Assessment \n \n7.  The Project is classified as an environmental Category A project, for which a full EIA is \nrequired.7 The EIA will be carried out in accordance with the Government's current regulations \nand  ADB's  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Agricultural  and  Natural  Resources \nDevelopment  Projects  (1991)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (March 1998). Specific attention is to be given to the current and anticipated \nfuture sources of pollution associated with the Chong Kneas community and operation of the \nharbor, and to means of eliminating all potentially serious threats to the environment from such \nsources. Incorporation into the Project of appropriate means to flush the harbor area and \nnavigation channel is to be considered, together with alternatives for treatment of such polluted \nwater. \n \n8.  The EIA should identify all positive and negative environmental and social impacts. For \nall  identified  adverse  impacts,  the  consultants  will  prepare  recommendations  for  the \nincorporation, into any subsequent investment project, of measures necessary to eliminate, \noffset, or reduce the adverse impacts to an acceptable limit. Wherever feasible, the consultants \nwill  identify  complementary  works  to  enhance  the  positive  environmental  impacts  of  the \nproposed works. A draft environmental management plan will be prepared to describe the \nprocedures for environmental management and monitoring. The plan will be finalized during \ndetailed design under the ensuing Project. \n \nD.  Social Assessment and Resettlement Plan \n \n9.  The consultants will conduct initial surveys and rapid appraisals among APs in the \ncommunes of Chong Kneas and Phnom Kraom to identify issues related to poverty, gender, \nethnic minorities, and participation.8 The findings will be used to design detailed social surveys, \nwhich will be carried out in a participatory manner under the consultants\u2019 supervision by locally \n                                                 \n6  Including, but not limited to (i) socioeconomic and sociocultural aspects of floating and land-based villages of \nChong Kneas, and other users of the Chong Kneas area and its resources; (ii) poverty and vulnerability; (iii) cargo, \npassenger, and fish movement through Chong Kneas; (iv) provincial development plans related to poverty \nreduction, fisheries, tourism, land and water transport, agriculture, forestry, land use, water supply, and sanitation, \nand watershed conservation; (v) environmental regulations, habitat conservation, and monitoring; and (vi) legal, \ninstitutional, and regulatory frameworks for resource management. \n7  The summary EIA report is to be circulated to the Board of Governors of ADB not less than 120 days prior to \nconsideration of the ensuing project by the Board. \n8  The procedures for conducting rapid rural appraisals are described in ADB\u2019s Handbook for Incorporation of Social \nDimensions in Projects (May 1994). \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \nrecruited  domestic  consultants.9  Baseline  profiles  will  be  prepared  of  demographic,  social, \neconomic, poverty, gender, and ethnic minority characteristics. These will include characteristics \nof households, birth rates, age, education, health, mortality and life expectancy, livelihoods, \nincomes, expenditures, borrowings, in- and out-migration, wage and labor rates by gender and \noccupation, vulnerability, and all other relevant data. All data will be gender disaggregated, and \nparticular attention will be given to the problems, constraints, options, and priorities of female-\nheaded households and women of the Cham or Khmer Islam community. \n \n10.  A gender action plan will be prepared in accordance with ADB's Policy on Gender and \nDevelopment. Particular attention will be paid to the needs, priorities, and constraints of ethnic \nminority  communities.  An  EMDP  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples and Social Protection Strategy. \n \n11.  The consultants will compile and analyze, in accordance with ADB's Handbook  for \nIntegrating Poverty Impacts in Economic Analysis, all data related to poverty and ongoing \npoverty reduction activities in the area, and will involve nongovernment organizations in surveys \nand reviews to the extent possible. The Project will be formulated to foster sustainable poverty \nreduction among affected communities. \n \n12.  The consultants will assess the roles and capacity of the commune council in the context \nof the ongoing decentralization process, and suggest ways in which the commune council can \nplay an effective role in project planning, design, and implementation, with particular reference \nto the management of the proposed new Chong Kneas township and harbor. The consultants \nshould prepare a stakeholder participation strategy including all stakeholders, underpinned by \ncapacity-building measures for different categories of stakeholders, particularly the commune \ncouncil, fishers, female-headed households, and ethnic minorities. \n \n13.  The  consultants  will  examine  the  likely  impacts,  both  positive  and  negative,  of  the \nproposed improvements on various groups of APs living in and pursuing livelihoods within and \naround Chong Kneas and, based on their preferences, will prepare time-bound resettlement \nplans in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policies on Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples. \nThe resettlement plans will cover affected households of both the Chong Kneas and Phnom \nKraom communes, including residents of floating and land-based communities, squatters, and \nothers who are determined to be eligible. The consultants will help determine the entitlements of \nAPs, including secure house site allocations, assistance for relocation and house building, \naccess to social infrastructure and services, livelihood improvement and alternative livelihood \ndevelopment,  requisite  budgetary  allocations  under  the  investment  project,  and  detailed \nimplementation plans including stakeholder participation and grievance resolution mechanisms. \nMechanisms will be designed to encourage and facilitate participation of the commune council, \nwomen, and ethnic minority communities in the design and implementation of improvements at \nChong Kneas. The plans will include participatory monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. \n \nE.  Review of Institutional and Legal Frameworks \n \n14.  A review will be made of the current institutional and statutory frameworks for inland port \nmanagement and operation, including institutional mandates and capacities, boat licensing, \n                                                 \n9  The socioeconomic and poverty survey will be conducted in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Incorporation of \nSocial Dimensions in Bank Operations (October 1993) and Handbook for Poverty and Social Analysis (Social \nDevelopment Division, Office of the Environment and Social Development [SOCD] draft 2001). Reference will also \nbe made to ADB's Poverty Reduction Strategy: Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific (October 1999). \n   ", "    Appendix 4  13\narrangements for ensuring access to the facilities by each of the major stakeholder groups, \nrights of redress for local residents deprived of normal freedom of movement or access to \ntraditional sources of income, financing of operation and maintenance (O&M) of port facilities, \ncost sharing by users for capital investment and O&M, and environmental safeguards and \nmonitoring. Attention will also be given to assessing the effectiveness of regulations relating to \nthe collection and disposal of solid wastes; collection and treatment of liquid wastes; and \nhandling and storage of dangerous goods, fuel, and other hazardous products. \n \nF.  Establishment of a Tonle Sap Harbor Management Authority \n \n15.  The  consultants  will  develop  a  management  concept  for  the  Tonle  Sap  Harbor \nManagement Authority (TSHMA) that will be created to oversee and manage the harbor and all \nrelated  facilities.  They  will  make  recommendations,  as  necessary  and  in  consultation  with \nMPWT and other ministries and agencies, including the Siem Reap provincial government, for \nregulatory and institutional reforms to facilitate improved management of Chong Kneas harbor. \nThey will also formulate capacity-building action plans, including interim measures to enable \neffective  operation  during  project  implementation.  The  consultants  will  conduct  workshops \namong  stakeholder  agencies  and  community  representatives  to  develop  consensus  for \nproposed  changes.  The  consultants  will  formulate  an  advisory  TA,  for  implementation  in \nassociation with the ensuing project, to build the capacity of TSHMA. \n \nG.  Feasibility-Level Design of the Project \n \n16.  The consultants will conduct a survey on the movement of passengers, fish, traded \ncommodities, and other cargo through Chong Kneas. They will compile and analyze all available \ndata and will make predictions as to the likely growth in demand. Account will be taken of any \nalternative transport systems being developed or upgraded (such as Highways Nos. 5 and 6) \nthat could affect demand at Chong Kneas. \n \n17.  The consultants will design an appropriate layout for Chong Kneas township and harbor, \nbased upon creation of a flood-free platform built from earth. The requisite landfill would be \nobtained from excavation to deepen and widen the existing navigation channel and to form a \nnew harbor with year-round access for boats to the lake. The optimum site for the platform \n(between  the  lake  shore  and  Phnom  Kraom)  will  be  decided  on  the  basis  of  social, \nenvironmental, and economic studies under the TA.10 The new township will incorporate a \nsubdivided  housing  area;  drinking  water  supply;  sanitation;  roads;  and  adequate  land  for \nschools,  clinics,  and  other  social  infrastructure  in  accordance  with  the  Government's \nresettlement policies.11 The consultants will examine population growth rates and include an \nappropriate allowance for natural growth over a 25-year period. \n \n18.  The harbor will incorporate separate berthing and unloading facilities for fish, cargo, fuel, \nand passengers, together with mooring for passenger, cargo, and fishing boats belonging to \nChong Kneas (but not houseboats). Inherent in the project concept is the resettlement of Chong \nKneas houseboat dwellers in fixed houses on dry land to achieve effective and sustainable \n                                                 \n10 A site close to Phnom Kraom would have the least impact on the fish and the greatest potential for reduction of \npollution. In addition, this location would maximize the area of flood-free land which could be created. \n11 All current residents of Chong Kneas will be eligible for house lots under the Project. The Government will \nundertake a census of residents of Chong Kneas prior to implementation of the TA to establish eligibility. \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \nimprovements in living conditions.12 The existing road embankment leading toward the lake from \nPhnom Kraom would be removed under the project, and raised embankments will not be \nprovided along the navigation channel.13 Issues of land title and compensation payments will be \nthoroughly  studied  during  TA  implementation  to  arrive  at  principles  and  standards  for \nresettlement  that  are  acceptable  to  both  the  Government  and  ADB.  Workshops  will  be \nconducted to secure broad consensus for recommended improvements. \n \n19.  The consultants will prepare a feasibility study for the investment and formulate a project \nfor possible funding by ADB. Design layouts and calculations will be prepared to a level of detail \nconsistent with the determination of technical and economic feasibility. Bills of quantities will be \nprepared so that project costs may be estimated to within 10% of final costs. The consultants \nwill consider the need for (i) capacity building of relevant agencies; (ii) regulatory reform; (iii) \nspecial equipment that may be needed to operate and maintain the improved site; (iv) means of \navoiding  entrapment  of  pollutants  within  the  navigation  channel  and  harbor  area;  and  (v) \nenvironmental education and awareness campaigns. \n \nH.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n \n20.  The  consultants  will  assess  the  economic  and  financial  viability  and  the  economic, \nfinancial, and fiscal sustainability of the ensuing project, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \nfor Economic Analysis of Projects and Workbook on Economic Evaluation of Environmental \nImpacts of Development Projects. The consultants will undertake preliminary analyses of the \nbenefits of the proposed works, especially those to the poor and other disadvantaged groups, \nand will establish the scope for reducing poverty under the project. \n \nI.  Formulation of a Possible Investment Project \n \n21.  The consultants will formulate an investment project for improvement of the social and \nnatural environment at Chong Kneas, if feasible. A design report will describe all calculations \nmade in relation to the various components, implementation arrangements, financing and cost \nsharing,  contract  packaging,  equipment  procurement  needs,  implementation  schedule, \nconsulting  requirements,  detailed  analysis  of  benefits  with  emphasis  on  poverty  reduction \nimpacts, and the project performance management system. \n \nJ.  Reporting \n \n22.  The consultants will produce an inception report at the end of the first month; a draft \nreport on capacity building for TSHMA by mid-month 4; a draft EIA, an EMDP, and resettlement \nplans by mid-month 6; and a draft final report at the end of month 7. The Government's and \nADB's  comments  on  the  draft  final  report  will  be  incorporated  into  the  final  report  to  be \nsubmitted by mid-month 8. The draft final report will include a logical framework and will be \nstructured in accordance with ADB's format for the report and recommendation of the President. \nAll reports will be prepared in English and will be translated into the Khmer language. \n                                                 \n12 Under the TA, surveys would be conducted to determine whether or not any of the persons presently living in \nhouseboats would wish to continue that way of life. If so, provision may be made for appropriate nearby berthing \nand development of supplementary livelihoods. \n13 The provision of raised embankments would encourage a continuation of the present pattern of living which is so \ndamaging to the environment, and may also encourage in-migration of houseboat dwellers from other parts of the \nlake. \n   "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20021208104514", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20021212113442+08'00'"}, "author_page": "   \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 November 2002) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  riel (KR) \nKR1.00 =  $0.00026 \n$1.00 =  KR3,835 \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  amsl  \u2013  above mean sea level \n  AP  \u2013  affected person \n  DPWT  \u2013  Department of Public Works and Transport \n  EIA  \u2013  environmental impact assessment \n  EMDP  \u2013  ethnic minority development plan \n  MLMUPC  \u2013  Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and \nConstruction \n  MPWT  \u2013  Ministry of Public Works and Transport  \n  O&M  \u2013  operation and maintenance \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  TSBR  \u2013  Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve \n  TSHMA  \u2013  Tonle Sap Harbor Management Authority \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n \n(ii)  In this Report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of I.
