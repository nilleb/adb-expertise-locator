INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed advisory technical assistance (ADTA) project will implement the reform \nagenda of Loan 2302 Greater Mekong Subregion Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor: Yen \nVien\u2013Lao Cai Railway Upgrading Project1 in Viet Nam. The Project will rehabilitate and upgrade \nthe Yen Vien\u2013Lao Cai railway line to improve connectivity along the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) Eastern Economic Corridor, comprising northern Viet Nam and Yunnan province of the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  and  will  improve  the  national  transportation  system \nconnecting  Hanoi  with  the  north-western  provinces.  The  loan  was  approved  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Board of Directors on 19 December 2006.2 \n2.  The reform agenda was identified and agreed with the Government of Viet Nam during \nloan preparation and will supplement the loan Project by assisting Viet Nam Railways (VNR) \nwith improving its accounting systems and its railway operations across the border with the \nPRC. This will help improve the sustainability of the railway. At the time of loan preparation it \nwas agreed that the ADTA project would be financed by the Government of France through the \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) but it was not decided whether the ADTA project \nwould be administered by ADB or by AFD. The Government of France has since requested \nADB to administer the technical assistance component. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  present  issues  in  VNR  arise  from  its  historical  legacy  of  central  government \nownership and operation, where the state invested in and subsidized the railway as a public \nutility with little concern for the quality of services and the economic efficiency and financial \nsustainability of operations. VNR\u2019s organization and operational procedures are being gradually \nmodernized  (see  paras.  8\u20139)  but  a  major  issue  is  VNR\u2019s  accounting  system,  which  is \ndecentralized and cash-flow based, reflecting VNR\u2019s heritage as a government department. The \nsystem does not reflect capital cost and centrally available data lacks the detail required for \nmanagement  and  marketing  to  effectively  adjust  services  to  the  requirements  of  a  rapidly \ngrowing market economy. As a result, road transport has gained increasing importance, even \nwhere railway transport is inherently more efficient than road transport, such as the long-\ndistance transport of bulk commodities and containers. \nA.  The Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s Strategy \n4.  The transport sector plays an important role in facilitating rapid economic growth in Viet \nNam and, in turn, this generates increasing demand for transport. Between 1999 and 2005 \ntransport demand increased by an average of about 10% per annum. The Government gives \npriority to developing the country\u2019s transport infrastructure in step with transport demand, and \nreal  expenditure  in  transport  infrastructure  investments  was  12%  per  year  in  fixed  prices \nbetween 2000 and 2006.3 The Government\u2019s current strategy for the transport sector focuses on \n(i) targeting national and international financial resources and charging users of infrastructure \nwhere  possible;  (ii) encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  development, \noperation, and maintenance; (iii) promoting safety and environmental sustainability in transport; \nand (iv) promoting the modernization of infrastructure management. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006. Greater Mekong Subregion: Kunming-Hai Phong Transport Corridor: Yen Vien-Lao Cai Railway \nUpgrading Project. Manila. (Approved on 19 December 2006 for $60 million). \n2 The technical assistance first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 14 November 2007. \n3 Sources: Economist Intelligence Unit Country Report Vietnam, November 2007, and data from the General \nStatistics Office of Vietnam. \n ", "2 \n5.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  Viet  Nam  (2007\u20132010)4 and  the  regional \ntransport  strategy  for  the  GMS5 both  support  the  objectives  of  the  Government\u2019s  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010.6 The overarching objective of ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy  is  the  reduction  of  poverty  through  implementation  of  an  economic  development \nstrategy that is closely aligned to the SEDP and its targeted outcomes. The regional transport \nstrategy emphasizes the importance of the smooth movement of people and goods in an \neconomically,  socially,  and  environmentally  sustainable  manner.  The  objective  of  ADB\u2019s \nstrategy for the railway sector in Viet Nam is to improve its economic and financial sustainability \nsuch that it is capable of efficiently and effectively meeting the demands of the rapidly growing \neconomy. \nB.  Regional Cooperation \n6.  The SEDP recognizes the importance of regional cooperation and integration in the \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals and Viet Nam\u2019s own development goals. It \nrecognizes that intraregional trade and investments plays an important role in accelerating the \npace of economic development in Viet Nam, but also notes that border districts and provinces, \nincluding Lao Cai, are among the poorest in the country and their future development will \ndepend on developments in neighboring countries. The SEDP encourages increased cross-\nborder trade and investment by (i) providing better cross-border infrastructure, (ii) reforming \ncustoms and administration, and (iii) strengthening and widening Viet Nam\u2019s participation in \nregional cooperation. \n7.  The Project railway line is part of the Kunming\u2013Hai Phong railway line, which forms part \nof the GMS Eastern Economic Corridor. Trade between Yunnan province and Viet Nam has \ngrown dramatically in recent years. Total trade across the Lao Cai\u2013Hekou border crossing grew \nby 36% in 2003 and by 51% in 2004, when it reached $366 million. In 2007 trade is expected to \nreach $700 million, and in 2008 $1 billion. The major commodities traded are steel ingots, \nfertilizers, chemicals, gypsum, seafood, vegetables, and fruit. More than 1 million tons of cargo \npasses through the Lao Cai\u2013Hekou border crossing annually. The crossing is a pilot GMS \nCross-Border  Transport  Agreement  (CBTA)7 border  crossing.  The  CBTA  is  a  multilateral \nagreement between the GMS countries. It facilitates road transport between the GMS countries \nby implementing measures such as (i) streamlined processing at the border; (ii) mutually agreed \nvehicle standards and driver requirements; and (iii) transit procedures that allow freight to be \ninspected at the point of departure and destination only, rather than at the intermediate border \ncrossings. When fully implemented, the CBTA will increase the efficiency of cross-border road \ntraffic. Similar streamlining of rail traffic is required in order to increase the competitiveness of \nrail transport. \nC.  Railway Reform \n8.  The ADTA project ties in with a wider railway sector reform program that has been \nongoing since the early 1990s and since 2000 has been provided with technical assistance by \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2006.

The  railway  sector  reforms  have  gradually  modernized  the \nstructure  and  legal  foundation  of  the  railway  subsector,  encompassing  (i) separating \ninfrastructure and operations by splitting VNR into VNR Administration (responsible for railway \ninfrastructure and regulation) and VNR Corporation (responsible for implementing maintenance \nand traffic; the split was implemented in 1994 and completed in January 1995 when the financial \naccounts of the two entities were separated); (ii) restructuring of VNR Corporation into four \noperations  areas  (traffic,  rolling  stock,  maintenance,  and  services)  in  January  1995; \n(iii) changing the status of VNR Operations to a state-owned corporation thereby separating the \nrailway\u2019s business activities from state management in March 2003; (iv) further dividing the \ntraffic area into freight and passenger operations in July 2003; and (v) passing of a new Railway \nLaw which provides the legal framework for the private sector to invest in and own new railway \ninfrastructure, and to operate privately owned trains on the state\u2019s railway network. The law was \nadopted in May 2005 and became effective on 1 January 2006. \n9.  The  ongoing  technical  assistance  from  Germany  is  centered  on  (i) preparing \nimplementing regulations for the new Railway Law, (ii) further reorganizing VNR Corporation, \n(iii) implementing  efficient  infrastructure  access  charging,  and  (iv) modernizing  railway \nregulations. The ADTA project will add to this by helping to secure VNR\u2019s financial sustainability \nby (i) modernizing its accounting systems, which will help VNR improve its cost and revenue \ncontrol and its price setting; and (ii) improving cross-border traffic operations to the PRC, which \nwill help increase VNR\u2019s revenue base by streamlining and modernizing cross-border railway \ntraffic procedures and facilities at the Lao Cai border crossing. The ADTA project is aligned with \nthe  Government\u2019s  objectives  of  making  rail  transport  more  competitive  and  financially \nsustainable in order to reduce the burden on state finances and increase the efficiency and \ninternational competitiveness of the economy. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The loan project supports Viet Nam\u2019s economic development and strengthens regional \ncooperation by physically enabling high capacity, cost effective, and efficient railway services on \na part of the GMS Eastern Economic Corridor between Lao Cai and Yien Vinh Station in Hanoi. \nThe ADTA project will support realizing this in full through two interventions, outlined below. \n11.  Cross-Border Traffic Improvement Study. This intervention will identify a means of \nimproving railway traffic facilitation at the Lao Cai\u2013Hekou border by improving cross-border \nprocedures and facilities. This would help reduce the barriers to subregional trade, thereby \nsupporting  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  development  and  at  the  same  time  increasing  VNR\u2019s \ncompetitiveness, traffic base, and revenue potential. The output of the intervention would be an \naction plan for improving cross-border railway traffic which, when implemented, would contribute \ndirectly to subregional integration by encouraging trade and improving the railway\u2019s modal \ncompetitiveness in relation to road transport by reducing the costs and delays for railway traffic \ncrossing the border. Long and uncertain cross-border times impart substantial additional costs \non transport users, and this reduces trade volumes and the attractiveness of railway transport. \nThe output of the study will provide the Vietnamese and PRC authorities with the information \nrequired to optimize the transportation of goods by rail between the two countries. Although the \nintervention will only assess the situation at the Lao Cai border crossing, its general findings and \nrecommendations could be applicable to Viet Nam\u2019s second railway border crossing at Dong \nDang, on the railway line between Hanoi and Nanning in the PRC. \n12.  Financial  Governance  Reform.  This  intervention  will  implement  stronger  financial \nmanagement  accounting  policies,  procedures,  and  internal  controls  in  a  unified  and \n ", "4 \ncomputerized  environment  that  provides  seamless  automation  of  financial  management \ndatabases with real-time or near real-time data links between the various organizational units of \nVNR. Accurate and timely information on the financial position and operating profitability of \nVNR\u2019s various services is required in order to enable VNR to compete effectively in a market-\noriented transport sector, especially since the passing of the new Railway Law which opens \nrailway transport to private operators. The intervention is scheduled over 5 years and is divided \ninto two phases. Phase 1 develops the new system of accounts in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles and implements it in selected parts of VNR, namely in the VNR \nunits engaged in operating and maintaining the railway corridor that is being upgraded under the \nProject.  Phase 2  implements  the  new  accounting  system  throughout  VNR.  Phase 1  is \nimplemented under this ADTA project and will take 2 years. Phase 2 will be implemented under \na future project and will take 3 years. ADB will consider supporting phase 2 when phase 1 has \nbeen successfully completed. \n13.  The outcome of the ADTA project will be (i) recommendations for streamlined railway \nborder operations at Lao Cai, thereby improving the attractiveness and efficiency of railway \ntransport  between  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam;  and  (ii)  a  modernized  system  of  financial \nmanagement accounts and internal controls designed in accordance with international best \npractices for financial reporting and control, and implemented and tested on a pilot basis along \nthe  investment  project  railway  line.  The  modernized  accounts  system  will  enable  full  cost \naccounting on an accrual basis and will be appropriate for a corporatized railway operating in a \nmarket-oriented economy. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n14.  To  achieve  the  outcomes  of  the  cross-border  traffic  improvement  study,  the  ADTA \nproject will (i) describe railway traffic conditions on the north-south corridor and the physical, \noperational, and procedural causes of disruptions and delays for border-crossing railway traffic; \n(ii) review and analyze existing agreements, regulations, procedures, and documents used for \nexchanges at the border; (iii) analyze the cross-border operations at the Lao Cai\u2013Hekou border \nin comparison with similar operations at five selected border crossings in Europe and Asia, in \nterms of organization, technology, procedures, and institutional structure using strengths and \nweaknesses analysis; (iv) quantify the consequences of these constraints in terms of additional \ncosts  for  the  railways  and  for  transport  users;  (v) recommend  physical,  operational,  and \nprocedural improvements that would reduce these costs; and (vi) prepare an action plan for \nimplementing the recommendations, which may incorporate investments in equipment and other \nphysical  means  at  Lao  Cai  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  or  from  other  sources,  and \nproposed  reforms  to  be  undertaken  by  the  railways  or  by  other  Government  or  private \ninstitutions in Viet Nam and the PRC. \n15.  To achieve the outcomes of the financial governance reform intervention the ADTA \nproject will (i) review the organization of VNR from a financial management perspective and \nwithin the context of the new Railway Law; (ii) conduct a management audit of VNR; (iii) review \nthe system of accounting, financial planning, and budget preparation, control, and execution, \nand make recommendations for improvement; (iv) review internal audit systems, if any, and \nmake recommendations for improvement; (v) review independent external auditing and make \nrecommendations for improvement; (vi) design and develop a management accounting system \nappropriate to the needs of VNR in a market economy and design data networks and databases \nthat  would  enable  frequent  but  not  necessarily  real-time  replication  between  a  centralized \naccounts database at VNR and decentralized accounts databases at VNR subsidiaries using \ninexpensive off-the-shelf components and software; (vii) design and implement training for VNR \nstaff; and (viii) assist VNR staff with implementing the new system on a pilot basis in the VNR \n ", "  5 \nsubsidiaries that operate on the investment project railway line. Outline terms of reference for \nconsultants for both interventions are in Appendix 2. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the ADTA project is estimated at $1.1 million equivalent, and will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Government  of  France  through  AFD8 in  the  amount  of \n\u20ac700,000,(currently equivalent to $980,000) and administered by ADB. The Government of Viet \nNam will finance the remaining $120,000 equivalent. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan is in Appendix 3. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  VNR will be the Executing Agency and will implement the project through its Railway \nProject  Management  Unit  (RPMU).  VNR  will  appoint  counterpart  staff  from  its  accounts \ndepartment and other associated units, and from Lao Cai, to work with the ADTA project \nconsultants during implementation. It will also establish a steering committee for the ADTA \nproject with representatives from relevant ministries and departments in VNR. The steering \ncommittee  will  be  headed  by  a  deputy  director  general.  VNR  and  the  RPMU  have  prior \nexperience with implementation of internationally funded projects, including the ongoing project \nfunded by ADB (see para 1) and projects funded by the governments of the PRC, France, and \nJapan. The RPMU has the resources required to effectively manage the ADTA project.  \n18.  An individual international consultant with expertise in cross-border traffic and trade \nfacilitation will be recruited by ADB for 6 person-months to undertake the cross-border traffic \nimprovement study. An international consulting firm, in cooperation with a local consulting firm, \nwill be engaged by ADB to implement the financial governance reform. A total of about 15 \nperson-months of international consultancy services and about 36 person-months of national \nconsultancy services are envisaged. The ADTA project is scheduled for initiation in May 2008 \nwith completion in April 2010. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 2. All \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n19.  Equipment for the ADTA project, encompassing software and equipment for pilot testing \nof the system, will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time),  and  will  be  turned  over  to  VNR  upon  Project  completion  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procedures.  The  ADTA  project  includes  training  of  VNR  staff  and \norientation of VNR management and local officials in Lao Cai and Hekou through workshops \nand seminars. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $980,000 to the Government \nof Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of France for Strengthening \nOperations and Business Processes in Viet Nam Railways, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n                                                 \n8 Financed through the Cooperation Fund for Project Preparation in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nMore cost effective and  \u25cf Passenger and  \u25cf VNR statistics  \u25cf Government committed to \nefficient railway  freight traffic increased  \u25cf VNR accounts  VNR reforms \nservices are attained to  by 7% per annum from \n\u25cf Government statistics.  \nsupport economic  2007 to 2010 \ngrowth and regional  \u25cf Operating ratio less \ntrade.   than 1. \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved railway cross- \u25cf Recommendations  \u25cf TA progress reports  \u25cf Institutional and \nborder operations and a  for improving railway  \u25cf TA review missions  organizational \nmodernized accounting  facilities adopted in Viet  reports  recommendations \nsystem operating on a  Nam and the PRC by  implemented by the \n\u25cf TA completion report. \npilot basis.

INTERVENTION  1:  IMPROVING  FACILITATION  OF  RAILWAY  TRAFFIC  AT  THE \nLAO CAI BORDER CROSSING \n1.  Scope and Objective \n1.  The  proposed  study  is  aimed  at  providing  Vietnamese  authorities,  as  well  as  their \ncounterparts  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  with  the  means  and  information \nnecessary to make rational decisions on how to optimize the transport of goods by rail between \nthe two countries. The study will address the situation at the Lao Cai\u2013Hekou border crossing, \nbut the lessons may be adapted for use on the other Viet Nam\u2013PRC rail border at Dong-Dang. \nThe findings of the study will also contribute to future bilateral exchanges between the PRC and \nViet Nam on rail policies. \n2.  The  study  aims  to  identify  bottlenecks  and  recommend  mitigation  measures.  It \nencompasses  two  tasks:  (i) review  of  the  existing  situation  at  the  Lao  Cai\u2013Hekou  border \ncrossing  and  determination  of  the  causes  of  delay,  covering  physical,  administrative  and \ninstitutional  processes  and  constraints;  and  (ii) analysis  and  preparation  of  proposals  for \nimprovements and a master plan for implementation. \n2.  Tasks \na.  Review of the Situation at the Lao Cai\u2013Hekou Border Crossing \n3.
