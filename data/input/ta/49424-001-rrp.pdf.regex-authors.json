THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Nepal for Supporting School Sector Development Plan.1 The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Supporting Policies and Implementation in the School Sector, and \nif the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The program will support the School Sector Development Plan (SSDP), which is the \ngovernment\u2019s major education initiative for FY2017\u2013FY2023. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  and  eight  other  joint  financing  partners  (JFPs)  will  finance  the  program  with  the \ngovernment during FY2017\u2013FY2021 through a sector-wide approach.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Nepal at a crossroads.  Nepal has gone through major political upheavals associated \nwith a protracted constitution-drafting process and frequent change in government. Despite \nthese challenges, economic growth in the country averaged 4.0% annually during the past \ndecade, and the proportion of people living below the poverty line declined from 31.0% in 2006 \nto 23.8% in 2015. Development of human capital is critical for Nepal\u2019s vision to emerge as an \ninclusive and prosperous middle-income country by 2030.3 Continued investment in school \neducation,  particularly  secondary  education,  will  help  the  country  graduate  from  its  least \ndeveloped  country  status  by  2022  and  achieve  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  Two \nimportant recent developments are opportune to strengthen school sector reforms. First, the \nConstitution of Nepal 2015 envisages education as a fundamental right and provides for free \nschool education (grades 1\u201312), thereby reinforcing the government\u2019s commitment. Second, the \nEighth Amendment to the Education Act (2016) paves the way for restructuring the fragmented \nschool sector into a holistic one and for implementing comprehensive reforms.4 \n \n4.  Sector performance. Steady progress has been made in increasing access and equity \nin basic education (grades 1\u22128). The net enrollment rate (NER) for basic education increased \nfrom 73.0% in 2008 to 89.4% in 2015.5 Girls\u2019 participation has increased, with gender parity \nachieved  in  enrollments  in  basic  education.  The  share  of  students  repeating  classes  has \ndeclined  and  the  continued  attendance  of  student  cohorts  from  grade  1  to  grade  8  has \nincreased. \n  \n5.  Despite  good  progress,  challenges  remain.  Few  students  progress  to  secondary \neducation (grades 9\u201312). Although enrollment in basic education is high, the NER for grades 9\u2013\n10 is only 58.0% and falls sharply to 16.8% for grades 11\u201312. The share of Dalits (a historically \nexcluded social group) in total enrollment is only 9% at the secondary level. Girls from the \npoorest  quintiles  and  from  disadvantaged  backgrounds  do  not  benefit  adequately  from \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The eight other JFPs are Australia, the European Union, Finland, the Global Partnership for Education, Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, Norway, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Bank. \n3  Government  of  Nepal,  National  Planning  Commission.  2015.  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  2016\u20132030: \nNational (Preliminary) Report. Kathmandu. \n4  Nepal\u2019s school sector is now divided into basic education (grades 1\u20138) and secondary education (grades 9\u201312). \n5  NER denotes number of students of official school age group enrolled in the corresponding level, divided by the \npopulation of the same age group. \n ", "2 \nsecondary education. The quality of student learning is inadequate. The National Assessment of \nStudent Achievement results reveal that average scores in grade 8 in 2013 were particularly low \nfor science (41%) and math (35%). There is a lack of subject teachers, particularly for science, \nmath, and English and inadequate teacher professional development. School leadership is \nineffective in leading school-based quality improvements.  Teaching and learning processes are \noutdated, relying heavily on teacher centered content delivery from textbooks. The percentage \nof students passing the grade 10 examination in 2015 was only 47.4%. Assessments and \nexaminations are largely focused on rote learning by students and do not adequately evaluate \ntheir ability to apply knowledge and skills.   \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n6.  Opportunities in school education. The SSDP is a new initiative of the government to \nimprove access, equity, and the quality of school education. The reforms proposed are geared \ntowards (i) the expansion of secondary education; (ii) improved teacher management to ensure \nadequate placement of trained subject teachers from grade 6 onward; (iii) a revamp in the way \nmath, science, and English are taught and learned; (iv) the augmented use of information and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)-enriched  learning;  and  (v)  the  implementation  of  a  model \nschool  program.  Recognizing  that  disadvantages  can  be  multidimensional  with  economic, \nsocial, and geographic aspects, the SSDP will implement a new equity strategy to reduce \ndisparities in access, participation, and learning outcomes.6 Institutional reforms are integral to \nSSDP.  A  National  Examinations  Board  will  be  established  to  improve  coherence  between \ncurriculum, textbooks, and assessments. The Education Review Office will be strengthened for \nregular  performance  audits  of  school  education.  The  SSDP  interventions  will  improve  the \nperformance of public schools in relation to private schools and upgrade the overall quality of \nhuman capital, and bring substantial individual and social returns. \n \n7.  Building on its extensive experience in education, ADB will support the government\u2019s \nSSDP  through  results-based  lending  (RBL).  Program-based  lending  was  the  appropriate \nmodality to support the School Sector Reform Program (SSRP) which preceded SSDP.7 The \nRBL modality is most suited to support the SSDP because (i) the government has demonstrated \nstrong leadership and commitment to implementing reforms in critical areas; (ii) the program \nrequires greater emphasis on translating policies already in place to implementation; and (iii) the \nJFPs have agreed on a single results framework and a common disbursement-linked indicators \n(DLIs) framework with the government which increases harmonization, reduces administrative \nburden and enables effective focus on results. ADB and other JFPs have coordinated due \ndiligence assessments, harmonized key DLIs, and agreed on joint program reviews. A program \naction  plan  (PAP)  will  support  timely  DLI  achievement.  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  assessments \nprovide reasonable assurance for effective achievement of results through RBL, with measures \nto strengthen program systems. \n \n8.  The SSDP builds on achievements and lessons from the SSRP. Midterm and final \nevaluations of the SSRP noted that while much progress had been made in access and equity \nin basic education, quality needed a stronger focus. The SSDP will support comprehensive \ninterventions to improve the quality of basic education and expand access to quality secondary \neducation. The SSDP will ensure that all newly built schools and classrooms meet disaster risk \n                                                \n6  Government of Nepal, Ministry of Education. 2014.

The SSRP was implemented during FY2010\u2013FY2016 and led to positive results in improved \nbasic education. \n ", "3 \nresilience standards. The National Reconstruction Authority is implementing a large-scale post-\nearthquake program for reconstruction and retrofitting of schools in 31 districts, including an \nADB project.8 \n \n9.  ADB has been a leading development partner in education and the program will build on \nthis experience. ADB funding will provide much-needed financial leverage for more investments \nto  improve  access  to  and  quality  of  school  education,  with  particular  focus  on  secondary \neducation. ADB financing will add value through key initiatives, such as the model school \nprogram,  examination  reform,  provision  of  subject  teachers,  and  improved  school  grant \nmanagement system. The program will catalyze capacity building and system strengthening in \nthe sector. ADB and other JFPs will adopt strong mitigation measures to address risks in public \nfinancial management, procurement, social and environment safeguards, and governance in \nschool education. ADB will facilitate innovative knowledge solutions to implement key SSDP \ncomponents  such  as  (i)  ICT-enriched  teaching  and  learning;  (ii)  teacher  professional \ndevelopment; (iii) activity-based pedagogy for math, science, and English; and (iv) model school \ndevelopment.    \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n10.  The SSDP aims to improve the equity, quality, efficiency, governance, and management \nof  school  education.  The  program  will  reinforce  the  SSDP  objectives  by  prioritizing  and \nsequencing key outputs and targets in the first 5 years of the SSDP (Table 1). The sector-wide \napproach in the SSDP enables the program to leverage the entire school sector budget for \ngreater efficiency and effectiveness of public resources. \n \nTable 1: Program Scope \n \nItem  Government Program (SSDP)  Results-Based Lending Program \nOutcome  Equity, quality, efficiency, governance, and  Equitable access to quality secondary \nmanagement of the education sector improved  education enhanceda \nKey outputs  Comprehensive program outputs for early  Same as in SSDP, but with particular focus \nchildhood education development to grade 12  on secondary education through the \neducation to increase access, equity, and  deployment of trained subject teachers, pro-\nquality; better qualified and trained teachers;  poor scholarship scheme, improved \nnational curriculum revised; textbooks  examinations, pilot testing of the model \nimproved; assessments and examinations  school program, and improved school \nimproved; and capacity for new federal  governance  \nstructure developed \nActivity types  School infrastructure upgraded, teacher  Same as in SSDP, but focusing on \ntraining revamped, curriculum renewed and  interventions for grades 6\u22128 of basic \ntextbooks developed, pro-poor scholarships  education and grades 9\u201312 (secondary \nand free textbooks provided, EMIS improved,  education) \nschool grant management system revised \nProgram  $10.58 billion for FY2017\u2212FY2023 (estimate)  $6.46 billion for FY2017\u2212FY2021 (estimate) \nexpenditure \nMain financiers  Government of Nepal, ADB, Australia, EU,  Government of Nepal, ADB, Australia, EU, \nFAO, Finland, GPE, JICA, Norway, UNESCO,  Finland, GPE, JICA, Norway, UNICEF and \nUNICEF, USAID, World Bank, and national  World Bank \nand international NGOs \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2015.

The  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  a  more  qualified  human  resource  base  for  equitable \nsocioeconomic  development,  aligned  with  Nepal's  SSDP.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced \nequitable access to quality secondary education. The GER for secondary education will be \nincreased by 7.0 percentage points over the baseline for boys and girls (DLI 1). The program \nwill benefit 6.3 million students, 153,200 teachers, and more than 34,000 schools. The four \noutputs are: \n \n12.  Output 1: Access to basic and secondary schools improved. This output will help \nimplement a revised pro-poor scholarship program in all 75 districts, and will include targeted \ninterventions for girls to take up secondary science education (DLI 1). Many students do not \nprogress  to  secondary  education  either  because  they  cannot  afford  it  or  the  learning \nenvironment in schools is poor. This output will redress the lack of affordability among students \nin the poorest quintile and the inadequate participation of girls in science subjects compared \nwith boys. Teachers often cover several subjects and multiple grades, which hampers quality \nimprovement, adversely affecting enrollment and retention in higher grades. This output will \nensure that 4,500 schools will each get separate individual subject teachers for math, science, \nand English in grades 6\u20138 and 9\u201312 (DLI 2, PAP 1.4).    \n \n13.  Output  2:  Quality  of  school  education  improved.  This  output  will  support  the \nprovision of activity-based teaching and learning materials in math, science, and English to \nschools (DLI 3, PAP 1.11); and additional ICT and e-resources to introduce students to modern \npedagogy (PAP 1.14). Schools do not have adequate access to materials to enable interactive \nlearning. This output will also strengthen the continuous professional development of subject \nteachers to use the materials in the classrooms (DLI 2, PAP 1.5). An autonomous National \nExamination Board will be established to reform student assessment and testing to reduce the \nfocus on rote learning and increase the emphasis on the application of knowledge and skills. \nPublic examinations at the end of grades 8 and 10 will be reformed and standardized based on \ninternational good practice to improve the quality and relevance of student learning (DLI 4; PAP \n1.8, 1.9, and 1.10). \n \n14.  Output 3: Model school program pilot tested. This output will support the upgrading \nof large secondary schools to model schools through interventions such as the provision of a \nseparate  head  teacher,  a  full  complement  of  subject  teachers,  disaster  risk-resilient \ninfrastructure,  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  a  library,  a  science  laboratory,  ICT  facilities, \ninternet connectivity, and e-resources. Residential facilities will be provided in selected schools \nto ensure that poor and marginalized students have access to high-quality education. Innovative \n ", "5 \npedagogy to improve teaching and learning, especially in math, science, and English, will be \nintroduced. With the provision of such comprehensive quality inputs, the model schools will act \nas demonstration sites for improving teaching and learning (DLI 5; PAP 1.12, 1.13, and 1.15). \n \n15.  Output 4: School system governance and management improved. This output aims \nto improve management, monitoring, and quality assurance mechanisms in the schools. It will \nsupport the implementation of a revised school grant system that responds better to contextual \nneeds  and  is  performance  oriented.  This  output  will  lead  to  the  rollout  of  a  web-based \naccounting and procurement system in all the districts to improve fiduciary management. The \neducation management information system (EMIS) will be upgraded to a web-based system \nthat will have greater accuracy as a result of third-party verification (DLIs 6 and 7; PAP 1.6, \n1.16, 1.17, 2.1 2.4, 3.2, and 3.3). \n \n16.  The seven DLI areas were derived from the SSDP results framework and the overall DLI \nframework  agreed  between  JFPs  and  the  government.  Financing  of  prior  results  DLIs  is \nenvisaged to ensure important enabling policy actions by loan effectiveness. These include the \nenactment of the Eighth Amendment to the Education Act, the development of selection criteria \nfor model schools, and formation of a dedicated program management and technical support \nteam for the program. The DLIs include an appropriate mix of outcome, output and institutional \nindicators. All output DLIs contribute to outcome (DLI 1). The DLIs are sufficiently ambitious as \nthey ensure a gradual and sustained scale-up of results, implementation of difficult reforms in \nteacher management, examinations and governance, and augmented use of ICT. The PAP \nincludes key actions that are required for achieving the targets in the DLI framework and in the \nresults framework. The DLIs and disbursement allocations are summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \nDisbursement  Share of Total \nAllocated  ADB \nIndicator  ($ million)  Financing (%) \nOutcome: Equitable access to quality secondary education enhanced     \nDLI 1: Increased access and participation of girls and boys in secondary  18.0  15.0 \neducation \nOutput 1: Access to basic and secondary schools improved     \nDLI 2: Improved deployment of trained subject teachers for math, science,  17.0  14.2 \nand English in basic and secondary schools \nOutput 2: Quality of school education improved     \nDLI 3: Activity-based math, science, and English materials to improve  11.0  9.2 \nteaching and learning provided \nDLI 4: Examination system reforms undertaken to improve teaching and  7.0  5.8 \nlearning \nOutput 3: Model school program pilot tested     \nDLI 5: Model schools pilot tested with comprehensive quality inputs and  28.0  23.3 \ninnovative teaching and learning \nOutput 4: School system governance and management improved     \nDLI 6: Improved governance and strengthened fiduciary management of  27.0  22.5 \nschools \nDLI 7: Enhanced reliability and transparency of the education management  12.0  10.0 \ninformation system data, including school-level data \nTotal  120.0  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DLI = disbursement-linked indicator. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.  The  annual  DLI  targets,  verification  protocols,  and  disbursement  schedule  are  in \nAppendix 3. A rigorous verification protocol, including independent third-party verification, has \nbeen established. Verification of outcome and output DLIs will be based on the EMIS, which will \nbe upgraded to a web-based system. An improved EMIS will have disaggregated data for \n ", "6 \ngender and social groups and increased accuracy from two rounds of independent third-party \nverification.  The  JFPs  will  undertake  two  joint  review  missions  annually  (i)  to  verify  the \nachievement of DLIs, review financial management reports, and audit reports; and (ii) to review \nannual  work  plans  and  budgets.  In  addition,  the  attached  Capacity  Development  TA  will \nundertake  periodic  surveys  to  assess  progress  and  to  improve  implementation.  The \nindependent Education Review Office will undertake regular quality audits of the school system.  \n \nE.  Expenditure Framework and Financing Plan \n \n18.  Program expenditures. The program expenditures are estimated at $6,461 million from \nFY2017 to FY2021. The total SSDP expenditures for the 7-year horizon (FY2017\u2013FY2023) are \nestimated at $10,577 million.

Program financing. The government will provide $5,761 million to the program, while \nJFPs, including ADB, are expected to contribute about $436 million. Although the share of JFPs \nin total expenditure is low, the contribution of JFPs is significant in leveraging development \nexpenditures, excluding salaries and remuneration that contribute to developmental outcomes. \nThe government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR85,507,000 from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the program.

The government is likely to request additional financing from ADB and other JFPs \nupon satisfactory implementation of the first 3 years to bridge the financing gap from 2019 to \n2021. The financing plan is summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Program Financing Plan, FY2017\u2013FY2021  \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nA.  Government  5,761.00  89.17 \nB.

Disbursement arrangements. The loan proceeds will be disbursed over 5 years to the \ngovernment's treasury account based on the verified achievement of DLIs. The government will \nensure that total program expenditures exceed the total loan  amount withdrawn.  ADB will \nprovide financing for prior results ($15 million), to be achieved by loan effectiveness. MOE, \nthrough  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  will  submit  a  withdrawal  application  annually,  providing \nevidence on the achievement of DLIs, along with unaudited financial statements for the period \nconcerned. Partial disbursements are allowed for DLIs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. Disbursements are \nallowed for early or late achievement of DLIs. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n21.  The  program  will  strengthen  capacity  in  the  school  education  sector  at  all  levels, \nparticularly  at  district  and  school  levels.  Capacity  development  activities  include  financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  gender  and  social  inclusion,  and  social  and  environment \nsafeguards. Key initiatives to improve quality in education include teacher training for math, \nscience, and English teaching; student assessment and examination reforms; improvement of \nthe reliability of EMIS; development of model schools; and ICT-enriched teaching and learning. \nThese are costed in the government\u2019s expenditure framework and incorporated in the PAP. \n \nG.  Technical Assistance \n \n22.  The  attached  capacity  development  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $625,000,  of  which \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nV). MOE is the executing agency. The government will provide counterpart staff, office and \nmeeting space, and coordination support. TA outputs include (i) annual fiduciary reviews to \nstrengthen financial management and procurement; (ii) independent verification of achievement \nof  DLIs; (iii)  the  development  of teacher  training to  use  activity-based  materials for  math, \nscience, and English; (iv) a road map for model school development; (v) safeguard compliance \nreporting; and (vi) the development of a scheme for pro-poor targeting of scholarships. The TA \nwill be coordinated through the Foreign Coordination Section of the Planning Division of MOE, \nwhich will function as the program coordination secretariat for the program. The TA will be \nimplemented immediately upon approval of the loan until 31 December 2021. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  MOE  is  the  executing  agency  and  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  is  the \nimplementing  agency.  An  interministerial  SSDP  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  MOE \nsecretary, will be established with the participation of key officials from MOE, DOE, Ministry of \nFinance, Financial Comptroller General Office, and the National Planning Commission; and the \nheads  of  central  line  agencies  in  education.  The  Foreign  Coordination  Section  of  MOE\u2019s \nPlanning Division will function as the program coordination secretariat. A technical working \ncommittee will be set up in DOE for timely program implementation. These arrangements will be \ncommon  for  all  JFPs  supporting  the  program  and  will  include  dedicated  teams  for  SSDP \n ", "8 \nimplementation  to  cover  areas  such  as  program  management,  financial  management, \nprocurement, safeguard compliance, and DLI verification.9 \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n24.  Technical assessments of the program were carried out through a joint appraisal of the \nprogram by JFPs and MOE. In addition, an external appraisal was carried out on behalf of the \nGlobal Partnership for Education. The main program interventions to support the achievement \nof the key targets were assessed positively. JFPs and the government agreed on a single \nresults framework with yearly targets and a common DLI framework.10   \n \n25.  The program is technically sound and highly relevant to the development needs of the \ncountry. With declining enrollments in early grades because of population trends and more \nstudents completing grade 8, the program will strengthen the government\u2019s focus on secondary \ngrades. The program envisages that more secondary schools will offer science subjects in \ngrades 11 and 12. The pilot testing of 200 model schools will demonstrate approaches to \nschool-based quality improvement.  \n \n26.  Substantial economic and social benefits are expected from the implementation of the \nSSDP. The three sources of quantifiable economic benefits are: (i) increase in the number of \nbasic and secondary education completers who earn higher wages (relative to non-completers), \n(ii) better quality of education resulting in a higher wage premium for all basic and secondary \neducation completers, and (iii) less wastage of public and private resources as a result of fewer \ndropouts and repetitions. The economic analysis resulted in a sound economic internal rate of \nreturn  of  16.0%  for  the  program  (12.6%  for  basic  education  and  23.9%  for  secondary \neducation). A sensitivity analysis revealed that the wage premium resulting from the higher \nquality of education affects the return on investment more than other variables, implying that \nelevating  the  overall  education  quality  of  the  workforce  would  bring  a  higher  return  on \ninvestment. Social analysis confirmed the program\u2019s strong poverty and gender focus. The \nprogram is categorized as gender equity as theme. Increasing the participation of girls in grades \n11 and 12, particularly in science subjects, is a specific objective.   \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n27.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The EMIS is the main database for reporting on \nkey performance indicators. Information on program and financial performance is provided \nthrough annual status reports and financial management reports. In addition, the Education \nReview Office conducts periodic performance audits of the MOE system. These monitoring and \nevaluation mechanisms will undergo further strengthening and will be used for the reporting and \nverification of DLI achievement. EMIS will undergo two rounds of third-party verification to \nensure accuracy. EMIS data will also be used to generate school profile cards for social audits \nand sector performance reports. \n \n                                                \n9  Under the Joint Financing Arrangement, a framework agreement between the JFPs (including ADB) and the \ngovernment, the parties have agreed on a common procedure for the government to conduct, and the JFPs to \nmonitor, the procurement of goods, works, and services under the program. As the funds of ADB and all other \nJFPs will be commingled to jointly finance the individual procurement packages under the program, universal \nprocurement will apply (ADB. 2013. Blanket Waiver of Member Country Procurement Eligibility Restrictions in \nCases of Cofinancing for Operations Financed from Asian Development Fund Resources. Manila). \n10 All JFPs support a common DLI framework, which will be included in the Joint Financing Arrangement. Some JFPs \nmay have simplified procedures that do not require DLIs and will release their funds based on satisfactory joint \nreview missions and presentation of audit reports. \n ", "9 \n28.  Fiduciary systems. The program will use program systems for financial management, \nprocurement, and anticorruption measures.11 The program fiduciary system assessment was \nundertaken  at  country,  MOE,  DOE,  and  District  Education  Office  (DEO)  levels.  The \ngovernment\u2019s Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment Report in 2015 had \nshown improvement in 16 out of 28 public financial management performance areas, compared \nwith  the  2008  assessment  report.12  However,  weaknesses  remain  in  internal  controls  and \noversight with capacity gaps in districts and schools. Problems of reconciliation between funds \nreleased by the Financial Comptroller General Office and expenditure recorded by the DEOs, \nand the lack of timely action on audit observations prevent efficient functioning. The overall \nfiduciary risk is substantial, which will be mitigated through a continuous program of system \nimprovement outlined in the Fiduciary Management Action Plan agreed between JFPs and the \ngovernment. A computerized government accounting system will be rolled out for timely and \naccurate financial management reporting. A task team on financial management in MOE will \nfollow up on audit observations.   \n \n29.  The program will follow program procurement systems. Country and sector procurement \ncapacity was assessed, drawing on ADB\u2019s 2015 country and sector procurement assessment. \nWeaknesses found include: (i) lack of trained procurement staff, (ii) weak procurement planning \nand  compliance  monitoring,  and  (iii)  inadequate  monitoring  of  contractual  performance  in \nschools. The overall procurement risk is substantial, which will be mitigated by (i) filling vacant \npositions in DEOs to handle procurement; (ii) developing manuals for well-defined procurement \nprocedures and training of DEO staff in procurement oversight; (iii) conducting school-level \ntraining  in  procurement  procedures,  including  compliance  with  disclosure  of  contract \nopportunities  and  awards;  (iv)  performing  an  annual  technical  audit  of  the  construction  of \nschools; and (v) promoting an electronic government procurement system with training for \nDEOs. The annual fiduciary review will diagnose bottlenecks and provide support to solve them. \n \n30.  The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government.13   \n \n31.  Safeguard systems. A program safeguard system assessment was carried out for \npotential  social  and  environment  impacts,  including  an  appraisal  of  applicable  laws  and \nregulations  and  institutional  capacity  for  mitigating  risks.14  The  major  risks  are  (i)  uneven \ncompliance with safeguard regulations; (ii) weak capacity to integrate safeguard measures in \nprogram  implementation;  and  (iii)  inadequate  documentation  on  safeguard  compliance, \nincluding the transfer of land titles from communities to schools for voluntary land donations. \nSafeguard  compliance  and  its  reporting  will  be  strengthened  with  the  establishment  of  a \nsafeguard desk with appropriate safeguard monitoring tools. The safeguard program actions are \nincluded in the PAP. The program safeguard systems assessment led to the categorization of B \nfor environment, C for involuntary resettlement, and B for indigenous people. \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. The risk ratings will be \nreduced from high and substantial to moderate and low with the mitigation measures. The \noverall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the risks and costs of mitigation. \n                                                \n11 Program systems refer to country systems with measures for improvements as agreed between ADB and the \nGovernment of Nepal. \n12 Government  of  Nepal,  Ministry  of  Finance.  2015.
