THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to be guaranteed by the Democratic Socialist Republic of        \nSri Lanka for the Wind Power Generation Project. \n \n2.  The project includes (i) wind power generation development\u2014consisting of construction \nof (a) 100 megawatts (MW) wind farm; (b) wind park internal infrastructure, internal cabling, and \naccess roads and other arrangements; and (c) a renewable energy dispatch control center to \nforecast, control, and manage intermittent wind power generation; (ii) improvement of power \nsystem reactive power management; and (iii) project engineering design review and supervision \nsupport in Mannar Island of the Northern Province. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sri Lanka\u2019s energy sector performance has achieved a national electrification ratio of \n99.3% (2016) up from 29% in 1990.1 However, the sector continues to struggle in meeting the \ngrowing demand for electricity at sufficiently low cost and acceptable reliability. The share of \nthermal power in the generation mix remains high at 67.2% in 2016 as the entire demand growth \nhas been served by oil-fired thermal (31.5%) and coal (35.7%) generation. Although 32.8% of the \ntotal generated power provided to the grid in 2016 was from renewable sources, including 24.6% \nlarge hydropower, 5.2% small hydropower, 2.4% wind power, and 0.6% other sources, the high \nshare of oil-fired thermal generation makes electricity expensive due to high fuel prices, and poses \na serious threat to the country\u2019s energy security and the environment.2 There is an urgent need \nto develop other clean energy sources in addition to hydropower, undertake loss reduction efforts, \nand address energy efficiency issues. Diversification to renewable energy sources, such as wind \nand solar energy, will improve the country\u2019s energy security and the environment.  \n \n4.  Developing wind power generation by both the public and private sectors and through \npublic\u2013private partnerships provides substantial opportunities to reach the country\u2019s goal of \nincreasing the share  of  nonconventional  renewable  energy  generation  to  20%  of the  total \ngenerated power by 2020.3 In 2016, total installed wind power generation capacity in Sri Lanka \nwas 131 MW, of which 128 MW were constructed by the private sector. This wind power \ngeneration capacity allowed the production of 343 gigawatt-hours. The feed-in-tariff for wind \npower of about SLRs23 per kilowatt-hour that is applicable to wind power plants with capacity of \nup to 10 MW is considered high compared with the world standards. This could be reduced if, \ninstead of the feed-in-tariff, a competitive bidding is applied for new wind power installations. \n \n5.  The Government of Sri Lanka aims to ensure the sustainable development of energy \nresources by improving the power supply systems to guarantee that the entire population has \naccess to electricity services. Sri Lanka has a national sector investment program that is based \non the National Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka.4 The policy and strategies include a \nsector road map, and policy and reform measures. To reduce the current high cost of thermal \n                                                \n1  Ceylon Electricity Board. 2017. Statistical Digest 2016. Colombo.  \n2  The year 2016 was a dry year with substantially less rains that resulted in the decrease of hydropower generation \nwith corresponding increase in oil-fired generation. \n3  Government of Sri Lanka. 2015. Sri Lanka Energy Sector Development Plan for a Knowledge Based Economy 2015\u2013\n2025. Colombo. Nonconventional renewable energy includes mini hydro up to 10 megawatts (MW), wind, solar, \nbiomass, tide, and geothermal power generation sources. \n4  Government of Sri Lanka. 2008. National Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka. Colombo. ", "2 \npower generation and attain cost recovery, the government developed 900 MW of low cost       \ncoal-fired capacity that became fully operational in 2014. The government aims to increase supply \ncapacity from renewable energy sources and potential future conversion of the oil-fired plants to \ngas-fired plants. The policies and incentives for developing renewable energy sources exist in the \ncountry. The increase to 20% of power generation from nonconventional renewable energy \nsources, including their current generation, will be in addition to 24.6% (2016) of conventional \nhydropower and will ensure that, in the future, a substantial portion of electricity is generated by \ndomestic clean energy sources. This will address the critical issue of energy security. \n \n6.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project will contribute to the government\u2019s goal of \nexpanding access to electricity and developing clean energy.5 This innovative, high technology \nproject represents the development of the first 100 MW wind park in Sri Lanka.6 It will create an \nenabling environment for wind power development through the use of a public\u2013private partnership \napproach in the future. The project will (i) build CEB\u2019s capacity to act as a wind park developer to \nattract the private sector in future wind power generation through competitive bidding; (ii) help to \nbenchmark capital and operational costs to be used in competitive bidding for private sector wind \npower development projects; and (iii) improve CEB\u2019s capacity to forecast, control, and manage \nintermittent renewable energy in the power system through dedicated control centers. The project \nwill also help to continue an ongoing and essential dialogue with the government on pursuing \npower subsector reforms in coordination with other interested parties and development partners. \n \n7.  The project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country partnership \nstrategy  for  Sri  Lanka.7 It  has  strong  grounds  on  previous  ADB  interventions  focused  on \nsupporting investments in power transmission and distribution to expand access to clean and \nreliable electricity and renewable energy development.8 The project considers lessons relating to \ngrid  integration  of  renewable  energy  and  strengthening  CEB\u2019s  capacity  in  complex  project \nsupervision from  the  previous  projects,  and  incorporates  them  in  improved  implementation \narrangements and project design. It will support the sustainable development of the energy sector \n                                                \n5  The project is included in ADB. 2017.

Impact and Outcome \n8.  The project is aligned with the following impact: access to clean and reliable power supply \nin Sri Lanka enhanced by 2025 (footnote 3). The project will have the following outcome: clean \npower generation increased.10 \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  Output 1: Wind power generation capacity increased. This output consists of three \nsubcomponents: (i) 100 MW wind power park constructed in Mannar Island in the Northern \nProvince;11 (ii) wind park infrastructure developed that involves construction of the wind park\u2019s \ninternal medium voltage infrastructure, internal cabling, access roads, and other arrangements; \nand (iii) a renewable energy dispatch control center established to forecast, control, and manage \nintermittent 100 MW wind power generation.12 \n \n10.  Output 2: System reactive power management improved.  This includes installation of \n100 megavolt-ampere reactive (MVAr) reactors at the 220 kilovolt (kV) level at the Anuradhapura \ngrid substation in the North Central Province, and a 50 MVAr reactor at the 220 kV level at the \nMannar grid substation in the Northern Province to manage voltage levels within the planning \nlimits and practical operational requirements, and ensure reliable operation of the wind park. \n \n11.  Output 3: Capacity of CEB in project engineering design review and supervision \nstrengthened.  Expert consultancy services will be procured to strengthen CEB\u2019s capacity in \nproject engineering design, review, and supervision. These advisory consultancy services will \nassist CEB in ensuring engineering oversight of wind turbine installation, commissioning and \ntesting activities, and technical certification of contractor\u2019s activities throughout the construction \nperiod. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $256.7 million (Table 1). \n \n13.  Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).13 The expenditure categories will include turnkey contracts \nfor the wind plant, consisting of the 100 MW wind farm, internal infrastructure, and a renewable \nenergy dispatch control center, the 150 MVAr reactors, and consultancy services for the project \nengineering design review and supervision. \n                                                \n9  ADB continuously coordinates with major development partners in Sri Lanka, including Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the World Bank. JICA is planning to finance \nthe construction of a pumped storage in 2020 that would allow using wind power generated during off-peak hours for \nstoring hydroelectric energy for load balancing rather than curtailing generation at the proposed wind park and other \ngeneration facilities. \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 Mannar Island was identified as high wind resource potential area based on studies of the National Renewable \nEnergy Laboratory (USA), Sustainable Energy Authority of Sri Lanka, and actual wind measurements and wind \nresource assessment at the proposed site financed by ADB\u2019s TA for Preparing the Clean Energy and Network \nEfficiency Improvement Project at the government\u2019s request (footnote 8).  \n12 Detailed Description of Project Outputs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

CEB has requested a regular loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwith a sovereign guarantee to help finance the project. The loan will have a 20-year term, including \na grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nthe interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line repayment \nmethod,14 the average maturity is 12.75 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n15.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \nthe project\u2019s base cost of all outputs, excluding taxes and duties, and a portion of contingencies. \nCEB will finance taxes and duties, a portion of contingencies, and incremental costs (e.g., land \nacquisition, environmental and social mitigation, and counterpart support). \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  200.0  77.9 \nCeylon Electricity Board  56.7  22.1 \nTotal  256.7  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n16.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  CEB will be the executing and implementing agency. A steering committee, chaired by the \nsecretary of the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, will guide CEB and review progress \nand  results.  CEB  will  set  up  a  project  management  unit  (PMU).  The  PMU  will  oversee \nprocurement, disbursement, financial management and accounting, quality assurance, social, \nand environmental issues, and will coordinate with the procurement committee, appointed by the \ncabinet or the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, depending on the contract size. Full-\ntime managers will supervise each project output under the project. \n \n18.  The  government  and  CEB  have  asked  ADB  to  approve  advance  contracting  for \nprocurement of goods and civil works, including preparing bidding documents, and inviting and \nreceiving bids for contracts, and retroactive financing under the project. Retroactive financing will \nbe allowed for up to 20% of the loan amount for expenditures incurred prior to loan effectiveness. \nThe  government  and  CEB  were  advised  that  ADB's  approval  of  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing in principle does not commit ADB to finance any part of the project. \n \n19.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 January 2018\u201331 December 2021 \nEstimated completion date   31 December 2021 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2022 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering committee consisting of the secretary, MPRE (chair) and \nrepresentatives of MDA, MNPEA, MOFMM, MPRE, and CEB \n(ii)  Executing agency  CEB \n(iii) Key implementing agencies  CEB \n(iv) Project management unit  Established in CEB \nProcurementa  International  2 contracts  $172.6 million \ncompetitive bidding \nConsulting services  Firm (QCBS)  1 consulting contract  $1.0 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting, including preparation of bidding documents, \nadvance contracting  inviting and receiving bids for contracts, and retroactive financing of \nup to 20% of the loan amount for expenditures incurred prior to loan \neffectiveness, but no earlier than 12 months before the signing of \nthe loan agreement. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between CEB and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CEB = Ceylon Electricity Board, MDA = Ministry of Development Assignments, \nMNPEA = Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, MOFMM = Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, MPRE \n= Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \na  Excludes local taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n   \n ", "6 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n20.  The project will use modern, proven wind power generation technologies and innovative \napproaches in forecasting, controlling, and managing intermittent renewable energy in the power \nsystem through the dedicated control center. CEB conducted technical studies for the proposed \noutputs with support from the consultants engaged under the project preparatory technical \nassistance financed by ADB (footnote 6). ADB followed up with its own assessment and found \nthe technical studies generally acceptable. The work undertaken indicates that the proposed \ntechnical solutions are feasible and execution arrangements are satisfactory. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  An  evaluation  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  project  and  its  expected  economic \nperformance was undertaken through a cost-benefit analysis, by comparing with\u2013 and without\u2013\nproject scenarios, and conducted using ADB guidelines for economic analysis.15 Economic \nanalysis was carried out at the output level. All project outputs have been confirmed as least cost, \nwith sound economic rationale for investment. The main economic benefits identified, quantified, \nand valued include additional clean power generation and improvements through better reactive \npower management. The aggregate economic internal rate of return of the project was estimated \nat 16.6%; above the assumed economic hurdle rate of 9%. Various scenarios were modeled to \ntest the sensitivity of estimated economic returns to key assumptions. In all cases, the aggregate \neconomic internal rate of return exceeded the 9% hurdle rate, reflecting the project\u2019s expected \nrobust economic performance. \n \n22.  Financial viability of the proposed investment was examined by comparing the incremental \ncosts and benefits on a with- and without-investment basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines \nfor financial management and analysis of projects.16 The overall internal rate of return of the three \noutputs was estimated at 4.2%, which compares favorably with the project\u2019s weighted average \ncost of capital of 2.6%. Sensitivity analysis was also undertaken to test the robustness of the \nproject\u2019s financial  performance,  and  preliminary  results  indicate  that the  overall  investment \nremains viable under scenarios modeled. \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  CEB is one of two power utilities in the country. CEB is a vertically integrated utility \ncomprising six functional business units (FBUs). The Sri Lanka Electricity Act, 2009 encourages \nefficiency improvements of CEB by regulating each FBU. The act empowers the Public Utilities \nCommission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), an independent regulator for energy and water established \nunder the PUCSL Act, 2002, to regulate the electricity supply industry. PUCSL regulates each \nFBU separately under individual licenses. Financial accounts are segregated to allow each FBU \nto operate as a profit center, and a transfer-pricing scheme between FBUs was developed. \nHowever, the process of delegating day-to-day management and financial decision making to \nFBU heads is not complete and the transfer-pricing scheme is not functioning properly. PUCSL \nestablished a tariff methodology and a road map for tariff reforms and rebalancing. \n \n                                                \n15 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n24.  CEB has the necessary capacity to undertake the project. It was the implementing agency \nfor past ADB-financed projects and has managed investments funded by other development \npartners. The financial management assessment of CEB concludes that it can fulfill ADB\u2019s \nfiduciary requirements for the project. CEB regularly faces cash shortfalls because of low tariffs, \nexpensive power generation, and expensive short-term loans. These shortcomings need to be \ncorrected. Under the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, all tariffs must reflect costs; and Treasury will bear \nthe cost of any government-approved subsidy. The tariff order issued by PUCSL in January 2011 \nincreased the average electricity tariff by about 8%. In February 2012, PUCSL implemented a fuel \nadjustment formula for certain customer categories. In April 2013, retail electricity tariffs were \nincreased by 35% on average. Subsequently, the government has converted CEB\u2019s long-term \ndebt into equity. \n \n25.  The financial management capacity of CEB is assessed as acceptable for the project. The \noverall financial management risk is assessed as moderate and several risk mitigation measures \nwill be implemented. Details of the financial management assessments of CEB are available in \nthe PAM and in the assessment of CEB\u2019s financial performance and projections.17 CEB\u2019s financial \nperformance has improved in 2013\u20132015, particularly in 2015 due to better rainfall and, thus, \nhigher low-cost hydropower generation. However, lack of rains reduced hydropower generation \nand increased the average power generation cost in 2016. CEB\u2019s financial sustainability will \ndepend on the extent to which the utility is allowed to charge its customers fully cost-reflective \ntariffs to service debt, and to undertake a prudent capital and operating expenditure program. The \ngovernment intends to improve financial management and efficiency in CEB, and advance CEB \ninternal reforms envisaged under the Sri Lanka Electricity Act. This is consistent with public \nfinancial management and state enterprise reforms agreed in June 2016 by the government with \nthe International Monetary Fund as part of the 3-year program under the Extended Fund Facility \nto support the country\u2019s economic reform agenda.18 \n \n26.  All procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time). Recruitment of consultants will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). An oversight \nrole by ADB will ensure integrity in procurement and implementation activities. CEB maintains a \nproject website that will be updated regularly and includes (i) bidding procedures, bidders, and \ncontract awards; (ii) use of funds disbursed under the project; and (iii) physical progress. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment  and  CEB.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n27.  The project will contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty reduction, and \nsocial well-being through increased power supply from clean wind energy in Mannar Island. The \nproject will ensure greater access to a stable supply of electricity to industrial and commercial \ncustomers  and  to  the  general  public,  which  will  promote  business  expansion  and  create \nemployment opportunities to the local communities, including poor and socially disadvantaged \npeople, during the implementation phase. The project is expected to generate jobs for skilled and \nunskilled laborers, including poor, vulnerable groups, and women, during construction.

A loan agreement will include a standard assurance related to the compliance with \nhost country labor standards for contractors. Stakeholder dialogue and communications were \ncarried out during the project design stage and will continue during implementation. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n29.  Environment (category A). The project is classified as environment category A due to its \nenvironmentally sensitive location on a migratory bird route and potential impacts.20 Following \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  national  regulations,  a  draft  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA), including an environmental management plan (EMP), was prepared and \ndisclosed in ADB\u2019s website on 18 May 2017. Any update of the EIA resulting from a change in \nproject scope will be similarly disclosed. Mitigation measures are proposed in the EIA and EMP \nto minimize habitat and species disturbance, and impact on fishermen\u2019s livelihood, health, and \nsafety as a result of project construction, noise, shadow flicker and visual impacts, and potential \nbird  collision  with  the  wind  turbines  during  operation.21 Implementation  of  the  biodiversity \nmanagement plan that is being developed will ensure no net loss of biodiversity at the wind power \ngeneration site.22 Public consultations and focus group meetings were conducted with local \ncommunities, fishermen, women, government authorities, and nongovernment organizations, \nincluding ornithological societies. Their feedback was taken into account during the project \ndesign. Public concerns are identified in the EIA, and mitigation measures are incorporated into \nthe EMP. The PMU has dedicated environment specialists for monitoring environment issues and \nimplementing the EMP. \n \n30.  CEB has implemented several ADB projects, including category A projects,23 and has \nadequate  institutional  capacity  and  experience  to  manage  environmental  risks  during \npreconstruction, construction, and operation. The EMP will be incorporated into civil works \ncontracts, giving contractors the primary responsibility for implementation during construction. \nCEB  will  supervise  construction  and  EMP  implementation.  CEB  will  provide  environmental \nmonitoring reports to ADB quarterly during construction and annually during operation, and retain \nqualified external experts or nongovernment organizations to verify monitoring information of the \nproject for the environment. A corrective action plan will be prepared and implemented for any \nunanticipated environmental impacts and noncompliance issues. The contractors and CEB will \nadhere to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national environmental regulations. In the event \n                                                \n19 ADB.

Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project is classified as category B for \ninvoluntary resettlement.24 The acquisition of approximately 90.3 hectares (ha) of private land is \nrequired for 39 wind turbines,25 2.21 kilometers of new access roads, and one new staff building. \nThe number of the affected entities are 39 joint owners, five companies, and other unidentified \nowners.26 CEB will purchase 12.5 ha of land from four joint private owners and two companies. \nThe remaining 77.8 ha of land will be procured through a land acquisition process. The land to be \nacquired is hardly used for any productive or residential purposes and is free of encumbrances. \nAll the landowners have other income sources, and no vulnerable households are present among \nthe identified landowners. Neither physical displacements nor significant resettlement impacts are \nanticipated due to the project. The turbines and power evacuation line from the wind park to \nNadukuda pooling substation will be connected through 33 kV underground cables following the \nright of way of the access roads. No land acquisition is expected for a new pier, but fishing \nactivities may be temporarily affected. The project\u2019s social impacts were adequately assessed, \nand compensation will be paid to the affected people commensurate to the impacts. Budgetary \nprovisions are in place to compensate affected people in a timely manner for the losses, if and \nwhen they occur. Social surveys and consultations were undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement in 2016\u20132017 and will continue during project implementation. \nFollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national regulations, the draft resettlement plan \nwas disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 8 June 2017. Any update of the resettlement plan resulting \nfrom a change in project scope will be disclosed.  Impacts due to noise and turbine toppling \ndistance were assessed based on a preliminary design of the wind farm, and mitigation measures \nhave been prepared. One of the mitigation options is to adjust the locations of sensitive receptors \nand relocate potentially affected structures.27 The numbers of affected structures and people will \nbe known after finalization of engineering designs by the contractor, as the impacts depend on \nthe number of turbines and their specification. The impacts will then be assessed and the \nresettlement plan will be updated. CEB has implemented several ADB projects and is capable of \nconducting resettlements in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. CEB will monitor \nthe implementation of the resettlement plan and submit monitoring reports to ADB semiannually.  \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not located in regions inhabited by \nindigenous population. Therefore, it will not have any impacts on indigenous peoples. Relevant \ndue diligence has been conducted, and the results are incorporated in the resettlement plan. \n \n33.  Climate change impact. The project\u2019s outputs will increase the clean power generation \ncapacity by 100 MW, which would result in 345,600 megawatt-hour energy generation per year, \nequivalent to avoiding about 265,700 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. The climate \nchange risk screening confirms that the project has medium climate change risk.28 \n \n                                                \n24 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 One turbine requires 150 meters by 150 meters of land, which is 2.25 ha. Among potential 39 wind turbines, two \nspecific turbines may not be considered due to interference with navy communication links. \n26 Approximately 50 persons will be affected, based on the social survey and number of average household members \nin Sri Lanka. \n27 CEB initiated consultations for relocation of two cabanas with 21 ha of land acquisition and two naval quarters \nconsidering potential noise impacts, and intends to utilize a portion of CEB\u2019s allocation of project contingencies for \nthe relocation. \n28 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10 \nF.
