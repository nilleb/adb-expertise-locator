INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Highlighting \u201cknowledge solutions\u201d as a strategic priority, the Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identified  the  need  to  strengthen  knowledge \nmanagement to meet the demands of ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) through \nstronger  institutional  coordination.  This  would  better  capture  the  knowledge  embedded  in \noperations and ensure that the knowledge generated outside operations flows back to shape \nfuture operations.1 ADB\u2019s midterm review also called for the adoption of a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach \nto knowledge solutions by closely integrating knowledge operations with country operations. A \nkey  means  to  operationalize  this  approach  is  the  increased  involvement  of  the  recently \nestablished sector and thematic groups (STGs) in project development, and preparation of \nknowledge products and services (KPS) to reflect DMC demands and support ADB operations.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The development issue at the core of this technical assistance (TA) is the need to \nprovide  DMCs  with  more  and  better  knowledge  solutions  to  help  achieve  sustainable \ndevelopment and manage matters related to environment and climate change. ADB\u2019s midterm \nreview  recognizes  the  fast-changing  development  landscape  and  that  most  DMCs  have \nachieved, or are expected to achieve, middle-income status by 2020. For one, DMCs are now \nmore closely integrated and connected thanks to improved infrastructure and information and \ncommunication technology. These developments necessitate enhanced knowledge support for \nADB\u2019s lending and nonlending activities. Further, several events in 2015\u2014(i) Third International \nConference  on  Financing  for  Development  in  Addis  Ababa  in  July,  (ii)  adoption  of  the \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) during the United Nations\u2019 annual meeting in New York \nin  September,  and  (iii)  the  21st  Conference  of  the  Parties  in  Paris  in  December\u2014have \nsignificantly changed or will change the development landscape in the region, and require ADB \nto respond better and faster to DMC needs.3 \n \n3.  The nature of the challenges faced by DMCs continues to evolve and clients increasingly \ndemand  Finance++  solutions\u2014financing  matched  with  knowledge  solutions  and  faster  and \nbetter coordinated delivery of knowledge solutions. This evolution is reflected in the areas \nspecified for DMC knowledge support in (i) ADB country partnership strategies, (ii) country \nknowledge plans (CKPs), (iii) lists of indicative knowledge products and events, and (iv) work \nplans of the STGs. The preparation of CKPs provides a mechanism for more consultations and \ncoordination with ADB\u2019s operations departments and its resident missions, and informs the work \nof the STGs. The following figure illustrates the parties, relationships, and flows involved in \ndelivering DMC-driven knowledge. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Please refer \nto midterm review action items 1.2.4.3 and 3.4 (resident missions as knowledge custodians) and 3.5.3 (sector \nand/or thematic realignment). \n3  As ADB President Takehiko Nakao noted in Baku during the 2015 Annual Meeting: \u201cThe success of these global \ninitiatives on poverty and climate change will depend largely on actions by Asia and the Pacific\u2014after all, the \nregion has 54% of the world\u2019s population and around 35% of world GDP [gross domestic product], and will account \nfor more than 60% of global growth this year.\u201d \n ", "2   \nDelivering DMC-Driven Knowledge \n \n  Knowledge Supply from \u201cOne \nKnowledge  Country  ADB\u201d 3-year rolling knowledge \nDemand  Knowledge    work plan for all departments, \nPlan   \nand sector and thematic groups \n \n \nList of Indicative   \nKnowledge   \nPrivate Sector and \nother stakeholders  Publications and   \n  Events \n  Country  Subregional  Regional \nLocal \n  KPS  KPS  KPS \nGovernments \n \n \nResident mission \nMinistries   \n& CKP Leader \nExecuting Agencies    Knowledge \n  Partners \n \n \nCKP = country knowledge plan, KPS = knowledge products and services. \n \nSource: Knowledge Sharing and Services Center. 2014.

The TA will support the implementation of ADB\u2019s knowledge management strategy, and \nhelp tackle some critical weaknesses in ADB\u2019s delivery of knowledge solutions to its DMCs. For \none, project-specific efforts are not being linked to each other to ensure that knowledge flows \nfrom one DMC to another. Second, the flow of information is insufficient to understand and \nrespond to knowledge demand and supply by DMCs across the boundaries of ADB\u2019s operations \ndepartments, which creates a \u201csilo\u201d reality.4 As confirmed in ADB\u2019s recent 2015 top task survey, \nADB is valued for its knowledge sharing but the respondents, including DMCs, commented that \nADB\u2019s \u201cknowledge offerings are not such a good match for what they want.\u201d5 Helping to break \nthese silos, offer better matches, and accelerate the information flow, the TA will ensure that \nknowledge solutions developed under it will be leveraged, shared, and disseminated through \nvarious means, including ADB\u2019s k-Portal and k-Learn knowledge platforms, as well as sector \nand thematic training programs (including co-learning programs involving both DMC officials \nand ADB staff), such as the Asia Leadership Program on Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange.6 \n \n5.  After consultations with ADB\u2019s operations departments, including resident missions and \nSTGs, in particular during the formulation of their 3-year rolling work priorities and programs, the \nTA will target support in the following areas: (i) cross-sector, nexus, and crosscutting work (e.g., \nsustainable and smart cities; smart green infrastructure; food\u2013energy\u2013water\u2013climate nexus; \n                                                \n4  Technical assistance for (i) Knowledge for Solutions \u2013 Partnerships-Centers of Excellence (Subproject 1) focuses \non partnerships and centers of excellence (TA 8827-REG); (ii) Knowledge for Solutions \u2013 South\u2013South Knowledge \nSharing Program (Subproject 2) focuses on South\u2013South knowledge exchange (TA 8831-REG); (iii) Knowledge for \nSolutions \u2013 Knowledge Portal (Subproject 3) focuses on developing the knowledge portal (TA 8833-REG); and \n(iv) the proposed regional TA Unlocking Innovation for Development will focus on unlocking innovation. \n5  C.

The k-Learn will be launched by the \nfourth quarter of 2015. \n ", "3 \ngender and sustainable cities; mainstreaming of governance and capacity development into \nsector  operations;  natural  resource  management;  public\u2013private  partnerships  and  capacity \ndevelopment in sector operations, as well as energy, health, social protection, and/or urban \ninterconnected issues); (ii) new areas and approaches reflecting recent developments, such as \nthe SDGs and climate change agenda; (iii) continuous learning, networking, and knowledge \nsharing with DMCs, including through co-learning programs, in partnership with k-hubs, centers \nof excellence (COEs), and external partners; and (iv) promotion of global and regional best \npractices for application in DMCs. Given the extent and urgency of DMC demand in these areas, \nhowever, many are currently under-resourced. \n6. By  supporting  these  new  knowledge  priorities  of  the  STGs  and  ADB\u2019s  operations\ndepartments, the TA will respond to the suggestions from the Knowledge Management Action \nPlan and Knowledge Operations Review meetings that ADB use its operations cycle to ensure \nthat its knowledge solutions are relevant to DMCs and can be incorporated into operations. \nTaking into account the flows and links between the various parties (see the figure above), the \nTA will help ADB to deliver DMC-driven knowledge. One key need to be addressed by the TA is \nsupporting resident mission  country  directors  deliver  just-in-time  KPS,  particularly  requiring \ntechnical expertise, so that they can carry out their role as \u201cknowledge custodians\u201d in the design \nand implementation of CKPs. \nIII. THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7. The impact will be that more integrated development solutions and services in DMCs are\nimplemented.  The  outcome  will  be  that  more  crosscutting  and  demand-driven  knowledge \nsolutions for DMCs are adopted. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8. The TA will support DMCs in the priority areas described in para. 5 and, based on\nindicative proposals from the STGs and operations departments for TA support in the first half of \n2016, will have the following outputs: \n(i)  Crosscutting knowledge products and services released. The TA will support \ncross-sector,  crosscutting  knowledge  work,  including  but  not  limited  to  the \nfollowing  topics:  water  (institutional  reform  of  water  agencies)  and  gender; \ngovernance  and  infrastructure  (open  government  initiatives  to  enhance \ninfrastructure  delivery,  particularly  in  disaster-affected  areas);  environmental \nmanagement and management of climate change and disaster risks (region-wide \nassessment  of  critical  infrastructure  and  risks from climate  change  impacts); \neducation  and  infrastructure (for  skills  development,  technical  and  vocational \neducation,  and  training  projects);  and  water,  agriculture,  and  energy  for  the \nwater\u2013food\u2013energy nexus. \n(ii)  Timely  response  to  unplanned  developing  member  country  knowledge \nneeds strengthened. The TA will support just-in-time delivery of KPS, as may \nbe identified by ADB\u2019s operations departments and resident missions, so that \nADB can respond quickly and flexibly to changing or unforeseen circumstances \nand demands. This output will address the needs of resident mission country \ndirectors when additional technical expertise is required urgently.   \n(iii)  Knowledge in new emerging areas and approaches applied. The TA will \nsupport (a) research on financing needs to deliver the social protection agenda of ", "4   \nthe SDGs (e.g., estimating the financial size of national social policy gaps in \nrelation to the new SDGs, and exploring financing options to close national social \nprotection policy gaps in the region); (b) a study of sustainable transport priorities \nof DMCs and potential donor partners (for financial or in-kind contributions) and \nthe  application  of  new technologies  and  techniques  in  preparing  a financing \npartnership  facility  to  help  DMCs  achieve  sustainable  transport  and  meet \nfinancing  gaps;  and  (c)  a  health  study  on  innovative  universal  health-care \nprojects, both nationally and subregionally. \n(iv)  Continuous learning (including co-learning), networking, and knowledge \nsharing for DMCs in partnership with k-hubs, centers of excellence, and \nexternal  partners  expanded.  The  TA  will  support  co-learning  training, \nnetworking and knowledge-sharing events for DMCs in partnership with k-hubs, \nCOEs,  and  other  external  partners,  including  co-learning  with  DMC  officials \nduring (a) Social Protection Week, which will include focus on the new SDGs; \n(b) a climate risk management workshop to quantify risks and recognize and \nimplement  viable  climate  change  adaptation  responses  in  South  Asia; \n(c) partnership with local government units and COEs to develop actions plans \n(including legal frameworks and the institutional and financial capacity of local \ngovernments) and carry out activities to achieve SDG 16 (peace, justice, and \nstrong  institutions)  with  a  focus  on  better  public  service  delivery;  and  (d)  a \nconference with the United Nations Environment Programme on sanitation, and a \nregional study on fundable projects and policy reforms in the Asia and Pacific \nregion. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($590,000 from TASF-V and $910,000 from TASF-\nother sources). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC), in close \ncollaboration with the STGs and ADB\u2019s regional departments, will have overall responsibility for \nTA  implementation.  The  Knowledge  Sharing  and  Services  Center  (KSSC)  in  SDCC,  in \nconsultation with the Sector Advisory Service Division and the Social Development, Governance \nand Gender Division, will be responsible for receiving proposals from the STGs. Selection of the \nactivities to be supported by the TA  will be the responsibility of the TA advisory group, including \nthe senior director of the Sector Advisory Service Division; director of the Social Development, \nGovernance and Gender Division; and advisor of the SDCC and head of the KSSC. Proposals \nfor TA support during the first half of 2016 have been received, and have been summarized on \nan indicative basis (para. 8). To meet urgent, unanticipated, and catalytic demands from DMCs, \nproposals for just-in-time activities may be submitted by the regional departments or resident \nmissions at any time through the relevant STGs. Proposals for TA support during the second \nhalf of 2016 will be solicited in March 2016. The STG or regional department or resident mission \nthat submitted an approved proposal will be the \u201cactivity owner\u201d and will be tasked to implement \nthe proposed activity, including delivering the respective KPS and conducting related activities, \nsuch as recruiting consultants, substantiating disbursements, and/or seeking any counterpart \nsupport  from  government  agencies  concerned.  Given  the  role  of  ADB\u2019s  KSSC  in  the \ndevelopment of knowledge platforms, such as k-Portal or k-Learn, as well as its responsibility \nfor  sector  and  thematic  skills  development  programs,  KSSC  will  support  knowledge \n ", "  5 \ndissemination and leveraging of the resulting KPS. The TA is expected to be implemented from \nDecember 2015 to April 2017. \n \n11.  The principles and process in selecting TA activities are: \n(i)  A proposal can be prepared and submitted by ADB staff in her/his capacity as an \nSTG member or regional department staff (including resident mission staff) for \nreview  by  the  relevant  STG  chair(s)  and  technical  advisor(s).  The  proposal \nshould indicate (a) the issues to be addressed in one or more DMCs; (b) the \noutputs and implementation arrangements, e.g., the coordination arrangements, \nas  relevant,  with  the  relevant  regional  department(s)  and  STG(s),  and  the \ntimetable;  and  (c)  the  means  of  knowledge  sharing  and  dissemination  (as \nrelevant). \n(ii)  All proposed products and activities must be included in the STGs\u2019 work plans \nand/or  reflect  the  demands  of  DMCs,  as  confirmed  by  the  relevant regional \ndepartment  through  the  country  partnership  strategies  and  CKPs,  and  the \ncountry  operations  business  plan\u2019s  list  of  indicative  knowledge  products  and \nservices (as appropriate). \n(iii)  Proposals  endorsed  by  the  STG  technical  advisor(s)  will  be  reviewed  and \nprioritized by the TA advisory group. The implementation capacity of the \u201cactivity \nowner,\u201d including its ability and commitment to carry out activities on schedule \nand  within  budget,  substantiate  disbursements,  and  provide  a  brief  activity \ncompletion report, will be considered in the selection of proposals. \n \n12.  Based on indicative activities and discussions with the STGs and regional departments, \nabout 32 person-months of international and 37 person-months of national consultants are \nexpected to be needed to support TA activities and monitor the TA. These will include individual \ninternational and national consultants with relevant sector or thematic expertise. Consultants will \nbe engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Contracts  will  be  on  an  output-based  or  lump-sum  basis. \nDisbursements under the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n13.  To  ensure  efficient  and  effective  use  of  TA  funds,  terms  of  reference  and  project \nbudgeting  will  be  required,  along  with  periodic  reporting  (including  financial)  on  activity \nimplementation. SDCC will regularly communicate with the relevant STG members or regional \ndepartment officers and be responsible for overall TA implementation, including the preparation \nof reports. The TA will be monitored by assessing quality and timely delivery of outputs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Delivering Knowledge Solutions in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpacts the Technical Assistance Project is Aligned with \nMore integrated development solutions and services in DMCs implementeda \nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and  Data Sources or Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2017, at least five  Country operations business  Change in \nMore crosscutting and  knowledge solutions for  plan list of indicative KPS for  government \ndemand-driven  DMC policymakers included  2016 and 2017;  priorities in the \nknowledge solutions  or referenced in DMC  country knowledge plans of  DMC(s) where \nfor DMCs adopted  policies or strategies   relevant DMCs  solutions are \n(Baseline 2015: not  targeted \napplicable)  Resident mission/regional \ndepartment reports on \ndissemination \nOutputs \n1.
