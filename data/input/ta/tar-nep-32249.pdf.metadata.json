Following a request by His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal for technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare the Community-Based Water Supply and \nSanitation Project, the Fact-Finding Mission visited Nepal from 18 to 28 November 2001. To \nobtain stakeholders\u2019 views through a participatory approach, the Mission visited several water \nsupply projects in the Midwestern Region, and had discussions with user committees, local \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and local government officials to discuss the issues \nfaced by stakeholders at the grassroots level. The mission also met with various government \nagencies, international and national NGOs, and development agencies active in the rural water \nsupply and sanitation sector of Nepal to discuss the larger, sector-wide issues related to the TA. \nThis TA was developed on the basis of understandings reached with the Government and other \nstakeholders in the sector.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The  TA  follows  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  provide  support  for  rural  development, \nimprovements  in  basic  social  services  and  infrastructure,  and  women\u2019s\u2019  empowerment,  as \noutlined in the Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement2 for Nepal. The TA also strongly \nreflects the thematic priorities of human development, gender and development, and good \ngovernance, set forth in ADB\u2019s 2002-2004 country strategy and program update for Nepal.  \n \nII.   ISSUES OR PROBLEMS \n \n3.  Nepal\u2019s latest census indicates a population of 23.2 million, with 85.2 percent living in \nrural areas. The population growth rate is 2.27 percent. Classified as one of the world least \ndeveloped countries, 37 percent of Nepal\u2019s population lives under the poverty line of one dollar \nper day, 28 percent of the population are chronically undernourished, and the adult literacy rate \nis 40.4 percent.  \n \n4.  With less than 0.4 percent of the world\u2019s population, Nepal possesses 2.3 percent of the \nworld\u2019s water resources. Despite this abundance of water resources, however, the country\u2019s \nharsh terrain make access to water supply difficult for many segments of the population. The \nGovernment estimates water supply coverage to be around 70 percent nationwide; access in \nrural areas is substantially lower. Many rely on water from shallow wells, ponds, and streams, \nwhich  are  often  polluted.  The  burdens  associated  with  shortage  of  water  are  borne \ndisproportionately by women and children. Especially in the mountainous districts, women and \nfemale children can spend up to seven hours a day fetching water from distant sources.    \n \n5.  The problems associated with the limited access to sanitation and low levels of hygiene \nawareness are extensive, and again borne disproportionately by women and children. The \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reports that diarrhea accounts for up to 25 \npercent of all childhood deaths in the country. In terms of national morbidity patterns, ailments \nrelated  to  inadequate  water  and  sanitation  account  for  almost  72  percent  of  all  ailments \nreported.3 Sanitation coverage in 1997 was 61 percent in urban areas and only 17.5 percent in \nrural areas. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) 25 October 2001.  \n2  ADB. 2001. Poverty Partnership Agreement between Nepal and ADB. Manila. \n3  Skin disease 29.8%; worm infestation 14.9%; diarrhea 12.6%; dysentery 7.6%; Gastritis 7% (Source: United \n  Nations Development Programme. 1998. Nepal Human Development Report. New York City) ", "  2\n6.  Due to the high social costs of poor health and hygiene conditions, and the associated \nproblems of low productivity and poor quality of life, the Government has focused efforts on \nimproving  access  to  water  and  sanitation  in  rural  districts.  Recognizing  the  importance  of \ndevelopment in the sector, the Government\u2019s 9th Plan calls for 100 percent coverage of water \nsupply  and  40  percent  coverage  of  sanitation  by  2002.  Unfortunately,  given  the  present \ncircumstances, this is unrealistic.     \n \n7.  At  the  core  of  the  slow  growth  in  the  sector  are  limited  resources,  and  a  lack  of \naccountability and collaboration with stakeholders. From 5 to 7 percent of Nepal\u2019s development \nbudget is allocated to the water and sanitation sector. Of this, about two thirds is financed by \nexternal assistance, including ADB. Unfortunately, coordination and dialog among assistance \nagencies  is  inadequate,  resulting  in  significant  overlaps  in  target  areas,  and  inefficient \nmobilization of the resources available. The somewhat contradictory approaches to the sector \nadopted by various assistance agencies have created many tensions between stakeholders; \nand  the  Department  of  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  (DWSS),  officially  the  line  agency \nresponsible for the sector, has been largely excluded from any active dialog or role on many \nexternally  assisted  projects.  Other  significant  problems  in  the  sector  include  the  lack  of \ntransparency and comprehensive sector information at a central source, inadequate community \nparticipation during the implementation of water supply projects, the continued exclusion of \nwomen from community decision making, inefficient mobilization of NGOs, weak private sector \nactivity, inadequacy of health and hygiene education programs, and lack of focus on sanitation \nimprovements. \n \n8.  The institutional context of the rural water supply and sanitation sector in Nepal is in a \nstate of flux. The Ministry of Planning and Physical Works (MPPW) is principally responsible for \nwater supply-related activity in the country, including the development of sector strategies and \nprograms, overseeing budgets, and coordinating external assistance activities. Nepal Water \nSupply Corporation is a corporate entity under MPPW responsible for water production and \ndistribution on a commercial basis in the major urban centers of the country. DWSS, also under \nMPPW,  is  responsible  for  developing  water  supply  in  semi-urban  and  rural  areas,4  but  is \nrequired to hand over completed schemes to local governments and user groups for operation \nand maintenance. The Government is considering a major restructuring of DWSS, and its future \nrole in the sector is under debate. The restructuring is expected to move DWSS to more of a \nregulatory, quality control, and monitoring role, while still implementing the more technically \ncomplex schemes. Implementation of smaller schemes is expected to be decentralized to local \ngovernment units. However, because DWSS still retains the majority of technical expertise \nbecause technical capacity at the local level is a concern. \n \n9.  As the lead provider of external assistance, ADB has completed four rural water supply \nand sanitation projects in Nepal since 1985, for a total of $65 million. The latest, the 4th,5 RWSS \nproject is due for completion in early 2002.  ADB is also heavily involved in the urban water \nsupply sector through the Melamchi Water Supply Project6 and Small Towns Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector Project.7  Besides ADB, many other assistance agencies are also active in the \nrural water supply sector, although on a smaller scale. The largest among them, the World \nBank, is currently preparing a second phase of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund \n                                                 \n4  DWSS is only responsible for developing schemes that serve more than 500 people \n5  Loan 1464-NEP: Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, for $20 million, approved on 24 \n  September 1996. \n6  Loan 1820-NEP: Melamchi Water Supply Project, for $120 million, approved on 21 December 2000. \n7  Loan 1755-NEP: Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, for $35 million, approved on 12 \n  September 2000. ", "  3\nDevelopment Board Project, the exact scope of which is uncertain at this point. Other agencies \nand NGOs active in the sector include United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), Department of \nInternational  Development  (DFID),  Department  for  International  Development  Cooperation, \nWater Aid, Helvetas, and Nepal Water for Health (NEWAH).  \n \n10.  The primary lessons learned through efforts of ADB and others in the sector are (i) the \nimportance of emphasizing the process of community consultation and mobilization, to improve \nsystem sustainability, (ii) the need for gender inclusive implementation modalities to mainstream \nwomen\u2019s participation in the decision-making process, (iii) the need to emphasize hygiene \neducation programs and sanitation to maximize the impact of external assistance interventions, \nand (iv) the need for closer coordination between assistance efforts to avoid redundancies and \nidentify potential synergies. \n \n11.  To maximize the impact of future investments, ADB needs to reassess the role it plays in \nthe sector, the progress made to date, and the implementation modalities it will adopt in moving \nforward. Particular attention must be paid to effectively targeting assistance to the most needy \npopulation  segments,  improving  transparency  and  stakeholder  participation  in  project \ndevelopment and implementation, emphasizing the role of women in the sector, giving more \nfocus to hygiene education and sanitation, and developing a realistic sector strategy focused on \nrural water supply and sanitation.  \n \n12.  The TA will set the groundwork for this effort through several innovations including the \nuse of (i) geographic information system (GIS) mapping to analyze current coverage, inform \npolicy  dialog,  target  interventions,  and  monitor  progress;  and  (ii)  consensus  building \nmethodologies to ensure maximum transparency in the process, allow for maximum stakeholder \nparticipation from the very beginning, and increase local ownership of the overall project. Strong \nemphasis will be placed on supporting and channeling the wealth of local expertise in the \nsector, complementing the activities of other agencies, and developing effective modalities for \ncommunity-based development. DFID, UNICEF, as well as several NGOs have expressed keen \ninterest in collaborating in the process.8  \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n \n13.  The primary objective of the TA is to assist the Government in preparing the Community- \nBased Water Supply and Sanitation Project, suitable for financing through ADB\u2019s sector loan \nmodality. In keeping with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy,9 the TA will emphasize targeting \nassistance to the poorest areas of Nepal with the most acute shortages of drinking water and \nsanitation, wherever feasible. The project will include integrated water supply,10 sanitation, and \nhealth  and  hygiene  education  components.  The  TA  also  aims  to  substantially  increase \ntransparency and stakeholder involvement in the initial design process, increase participation at \nall levels of project implementation, and complement the activities of other assistance agencies \nactive in the sector. The TA is expected to first establish a clear sector strategy focusing on rural \nwater supply and sanitation to help prioritize investment decisions, and then to develop a project \n                                                 \n8  DFID and UNICEF have agreed to provide additional consulting and staff support for the TA. ADB TA consultants \n  are required to coordinate efforts with DFID and UNICEF as outlined in Appendix 2. \n9  ADB. 1999. Poverty Reduction Strategy.

", "  4\ndesign and implementation modality that is truly community driven. The processes involved and \nthe specific outputs required are explained in the following sections, and in appendixes 1 and 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will be carried out in three phases over 10 months, beginning in May 2002. The \ndetailed scope of each phase and the processes involved are described in the TA framework in \nAppendix 1 and the terms of reference for consulting services in Appendix 2.  \n \n15.  Phase I will assist the Government to (i) geographically map and analyze poverty data, \nincluding current data on water and sanitation coverage, incidence of waterborne disease, \ncurrent  and  projected  external  assistance  activity,  concentration  of  minorities  and \ndisadvantaged groups, and the distribution of local NGOs; (ii) identify priority areas based on \nthe need for improved coverage; (iii) conduct a social assessment in the identified target areas; \n(iv) analyze the evolving institutional structure of the sector; (v) assess the institutional and \nfinancial arrangements of the various assistance agencies active in the sector; and (vi) prepare \na realistic draft sector strategy for rural water supply and sanitation for discussion during phase \nII.   \n \n16.  Phase II11 will be an effort to combine the analysis with local knowledge through a \nprofessionally facilitated participatory process to (i) help the Government define a pragmatic \nsector strategy to guide investment and reform in the rural water and sanitation sector, and (ii) \nto develop a project implementation strategy and framework through consensus with the various \nstakeholders.  The  consensus  group  will  include  representatives  from  various  Government \nagencies, including DWSS, district development committees, village development committees, \nand  Ministry  of  Local  Development,  as  well  as  NGO  groups  and  external  assistance \nrepresentatives active in the sector.  At the end of phase II, a rural water and sanitation sector \nstrategy will be defined, and the major components of possible investment in the sector by ADB \nand  others  will  be  outlined.  With  regard  to  the  ADB  investment,  criteria  for  selection  of \nsubprojects  will  be  established;  participatory  processes  defined;  gender  considerations \nincorporated; financing arrangements defined; and institutional mechanisms for implementation, \ncost recovery, and maintenance defined.  \n  \n17.  Phase III will refine the project framework developed by the group into an investment \nproject suitable for financing by ADB and others. In this phase, the agreed-upon process will be \nfollowed to identify sample subprojects within the districts identified in phase I, develop technical \noptions in consultation with the communities; conduct economic and financial feasibility studies \nand initial environmental examinations; and prepare other documentation as required by ADB \nguidelines.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $910,000  equivalent,  including  $474,000  in  foreign \nexchange cost and $436,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will finance $750,000 \nequivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost, and $276,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost.  ADB will finance the TA on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby the Government of Japan. The Government contribution will be $160,000 equivalent and will \ninclude counterpart staff, office accommodation, and transport. The detailed cost estimates and \n                                                 \n11  Some of the activities of this phase will be conducted simultaneously with phase I, as described in Appendix 2. ", "  5\nfinancing plan are shown in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of \nthe TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  MPPW will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  It will set up a TA implementing unit; \nappoint a manager for the unit; and provide office space, furniture, equipment, and counterpart \nstaff for the TA consultants as necessary. In addition, MPPW will second at least two senior \nstaff members from DWSS and one senior staff member from Ministry of Local Development to \nbe full-time members of the implementation unit. The government will set up an TA advisory \ncommittee, to be chaired by the secretary, MPPW, to periodically review TA progress and \nresolve  any  issues  that  may  arise.  In  addition  to  MPPW,  the  committee  will  include \nrepresentatives from Ministry of Local Development, Ministry of Finance, National Planning \nCommission, Ministry of Health, DFID, UNICEF, DWSS, and ADB\u2019s Nepal Resident Mission.  \n \n20.  The TA will require approximately 15 person-months of international and 62 person- \nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services.  The  international  experts  (person-months  in \nparentheses) will include an institutional and sector policy specialist as team leader (6), financial \neconomist (2.5), gender and participation specialist (2), consensus building specialist (2), water \nand sanitation engineer (1), and GIS specialist (1.5). Domestic experts will include a water \nsupply engineer (8 person-months), social development specialist (8), financial analyst (6),  \nenvironment  specialist  (3),  GIS  specialists  (10),  professional  facilitators  (8),  and  others  as \nrequired. All international consultants will have a minimum of 10 years of relevant project \nexperience in their respective specialties, preferably within the region, and extensive experience \nworking on integrated projects with interdisciplinary teams. The domestic consultants will have a \nminimum of eight years of experience in their respective specialties, including experience with \nsimilar integrated projects funded by international organizations. The team leader will coordinate \nthe activities of the entire team, and be responsible for the overall quality and timeliness of all \noutputs. The specific tasks and inputs of the key consultants are outlined in the TA framework in \nAppendix 112 and the outline terms of reference for consulting services in Appendix 2. The \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. \n \n21.  The consultants will submit an inception report no later than one month after contract \nsigning. Short monthly progress reports summarizing project activities, issues, and constraints \nwill be submitted throughout the duration of the TA. In addition, four major reports will be \nsubmitted. The first will be submitted at the end of phase I, 12 weeks after inception and will \ninclude analysis and mapping of all data collected, as well as the issues analysis for phase II. It \nwill also include a summary document to be circulated to all stakeholders that will participate in \nthe consensus building activities of phase II. The second report, to be submitted 24 weeks after \ninception, will document the process and outcomes of the consensus building efforts, and define \nthe sample subprojects to be included in phase III. The draft final report will be submitted 36 \nweeks after project inception, and be reviewed by ADB and the Government. The final report \nwill be submitted within three weeks after receiving comments from the review.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal in an \namount not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 for the purpose of preparing the Community-\nBased Water Supply and Sanitation Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board. \n                                                 \n12 See \u201cInputs\u201d section in Appendix 1.

The consultants will be required to prepare an integrated project that is suitable for \nfinancing through the sector lending modality of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 Emphasis \nwill be placed on complying with all relevant ADB policies and guidelines, and developing the \nproject  with  extensive  participation  at  all  levels.  The  primary  responsibilities  for  each \ninternational consultant are outlined in the technical assistance (TA) framework in Appendix 1. \nThe team leader is responsible for defining the detailed work plans of the overall team. The TA \nwill be carried out in three phases. The specific activities to be carried out under each phase are \noutlined below. ADB consultants are required to coordinate project activities with the consultants \nfunded by Department of International Development (DFID) and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n(UNICEF) to support the TA.  \n \nA.   Phase 1: Data Collection, Mapping, and Institutional Analysis (3 months) \n \n2.  The focus in this phase is to compile comprehensive data about the sector and its \ninstitutional framework, and to arrive at a realistic draft sector strategy. The information collected \nwill  be  summarized  at  the  end  of  the  phase,  for  distribution  to  all  stakeholders  that  will \nparticipate in phase II. The specific activities of phase I include the following: \n \n(i)  Collect  data  on  water  supply  and  sanitation  coverage,  based  on  the  2001 \nnational  census,  recent  studies,  district  profiles,  and  records  of  all  funding \nagencies, international nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and government \nagencies active in the water supply and sanitation sector of Nepal. Collect data \non the incidence of waterborne disease through organizations active in the health \nsector.  Collect data and develop an inventory of NGOs active in the sector, and \ntheir geographic and sectoral focus. Also identify any concentrations of minorities \nor disadvantaged population groups based on census data. \n \n(ii)  Send  out  a  team  to  conduct  a  sample  survey  in  several  districts  in  each \nadministrative region2 to get current information on the depth of coverage, and \nconfirm the current operational status of systems that are in place.  \n \n(iii)  Determine the budget, scope, and coverage targets of ongoing and planned rural \nwater supply projects financed by various agencies and NGOs. Assess the scope \nand budget for planned and ongoing work by Department of Water Supply and \nSewerage (DWSS) and other government agencies.  \n \n(iv)  Use  geographic  information  system  (GIS)  software,  (preferably  Arcinfo  and \nArcview) to map the above data from sections (i) through (iii) up to a village \ndevelopment committee (VDC) level of detail wherever available; digital base \ninformation can be obtained through National Planning Commission (NPC) and \nInternational Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). Produce \nseparate maps indicating the geographic concentrations of each set of data at a \nsuitable scale, and produce a CD ROM containing the data sets and the maps, \nwhich are to be made publicly available through DWSS. Rank districts based on \n(a) access to water supply; (b) access to sanitation facilities; (c) incidence of \nwaterborne disease; and (d) incidence of poverty. This ranking will indicate the \ndistricts, and VDCs if possible, that have the most acute need for assistance in \n                                                 \n1  Possibly cofinanced by DFID and UNICEF \n2  Eastern, Central, Western, Midwestern, and Far Western regions  \n(Reference in text: page 3, para. 13) ", "11\nAppendix 2, page 2 \nwater supply and sanitation. The ensuing project should be targeted at these \nareas, wherever feasible.  \n \n(v)  Collect socioeconomic data about the priority areas and assess the major social \nissues  and  constraints.  Develop  a  methodology  for  the  detailed  social \nassessment of subprojects to be conducted in phase III.  \n \n(vi)  Assess the total financial envelope available for the water and sanitation sector, \nincluding investment from all potential sources including central Government, \nlocal government, and aid pipelines. Collect and assess community-level data on \ngeneral  affordability  and  willingness  to  pay  for  water  and  sanitation \nimprovements in each region through a sample survey. \n \n(vii)  Select a sample of subprojects completed under the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Rural Water \nSupply and Sanitation (RWSS) projects, representing the conditions of the terai, \nhills, and mountain regions. Analyze these sub projects, in close consultation \nwith the communities and other stakeholders, to understand both the positive and \nnegative  experiences  associated  with  implementation  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M). Evaluation criteria should be established in consultation \nwith the various stakeholders.  \n \n(viii)  Identify  sample  subprojects  implemented  by  other  assistance  agencies  and \nNGOs in the sector, as well as projects by DWSS without external financial \nsupport, and analyze them based on the criteria in (vii). Develop a summary \nmatrix  that  clearly  illustrates  the  relative  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  each \napproach, including that of ADB. As part of the analysis, consider the size of the \ninvestment and the scalability of individual approaches.  \n \n(ix)  Based on the subprojects analyzed, in (vii) and (viii), determine which technical \noptions are generally feasible in each district, the average costs per capita for \nservice  delivery  through  each  technology  option,  and  the  funds  required  to \nachieve the Government\u2019s target of 100 percent coverage in each district. Include \nthe  costs  associated  with  social  mobilization.  Link  this  data  with  the  GIS \ndatabase from (iv).  \n \n(x)  Analyze the institutional strengths, weaknesses, budgets, and financial capacities \nof DWSS, Department of Local Infrastructure and Roads (DOLIDAR), sample \ndistrict  development  committees  (DDCs)  and  VDCs,  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment, Ministry of Health, and other government agencies involved in the \nsector.  Also,  assess  the  institutional  capacity  of  sample  NGOs  that  could \npotentially be involved in the ensuing project. \n \n(xi)  Based  on  the  findings  of  this  analysis,  prepare  an  investment  prioritization \nframework for the sector. Based on this framework, prepare a realistic draft \nsector strategy for discussion during phase II; include short-, medium-, and long-\nterm implementation and investment plans.  \n \n(xii)  Prepare the phase I report, compiling all the data and analysis done during the \nphase. Prepare a summary document and supporting CD-ROM with the GIS data \nfor distribution to all the stakeholders that will participate in phase II.  ", "12\nAppendix 2, page 3 \nB.   Phase II: Design Through Consensus (3 months) \n \n3.  The primary intent of the consensus building effort is to channel the extensive local \nknowledge about the sector to first helping the Government to outline a realistic rural water \nsupply  and  sanitation  sector  strategy,  and  then  to  design  the  framework  for  the  ensuing \ninvestment  project.  This  process  is  expected  to  increase  transparency  and  maximize \nopportunities  for  participation  by  all  stakeholder  groups.  The  entire  process  should  be \ncoordinated and managed by a team of professional consensus-building specialists/facilitators,3 \npreferably with extensive experience in the region. Other specialists in the consulting team \nshould be participants in the consensus meetings. Note that tasks (i) through (iv) for this phase \nshould be carried out parallel with phase I. The specific tasks associated with this phase of the \nTA are as follows: \n \n(i)  Identify  individuals  to  represent  the  various  stakeholder  groups.  Allow  the \nstakeholders to nominate their own representatives, and ensure that all major \nstakeholder groups are represented. In the case of hard-to-represent groups, use \na  proxy.4  Send  out  invitations,  conduct  preliminary  discussions,  and  confirm \nparticipants. \n \n(ii)  Develop an issues assessment in consultation with all major stakeholder groups \nin the sector. Identify the major sectoral issues, where the various stakeholders \ndisagree, and where they may be able to find common ground. Explore issues \nthat affect both the formulation of a sector strategy, as well as the development \nof a project investment, and summarize views in an issues matrix. Define the \ndetailed methodology for the consensus building efforts of phase II. Circulate the \ndraft  issues  assessment  to  all  participants  for  comments;  make  a  Nepalese \ntranslation of the final version available to all participants, as required. \n \n(iii)  Coordinate  a  consensus  group  that  includes  all  the  stakeholders  identified \nthrough (i) and (ii). The participants, wherever possible, should be high-level \nstaff, capable of making commitments on behalf of their organization. The gender \nbalance  of  the  group  should  also  be  considered.  Establish  a  schedule  and \nreserve a venue for a series of consensus meetings, preferably in a neutral \nlocation such as a hotel or conference center. Prepare the agenda for each \nmeeting to focus on specific issues, with specific target outputs. The participants \nfor each thematic session may be varied to focus the discussion, but the outputs \nof each session will be shared with the entire consensus group.  \n \n(iv)  Circulate  the  Issues  assessment  together  with  the  summary  document  from \nphase I at least one week before the first consensus meeting. All material for \ndistribution should be brief and easy to understand, illustrated using graphics \nwherever possible.  \n \n(v)  Conduct a series of consensus meetings with a view to developing the ensuing \nproject. The beginning of each meeting should clearly lay out the ground rules for \nthe process, the basis for decision making, and the target output. A single text \n                                                 \n3  The team should include both international and domestic specialists. The ADB consultants will work in close \ncoordination with DFID and UNICEF in developing detailed processes for this phase. \n4  For example, a local NGO experienced in community mobilization may represent the interests of water user \ncommittees. The consensus group, however, should endorse the validity of such proxy representation in advance.  ", "13\nAppendix 2, page 4 \nprocess5  will  be  used  to  document  the  proceedings.  Equal  opportunity  and \nencouragement will be given for all stakeholders to participate. All attempts will \nbe made to reach consensus on every important issue. The consultant will clearly \ndocument, summarize, and seek agreement on the output of each session. The \nsummary of the output of the meeting will be circulated to the entire group the \nday after each meeting, and any final comments will be incorporated.  \n \n(vi)  The issues to be discussed and resolved through the consensus meetings will \ninclude (a) a realistic sector strategy and action plan for the rural water supply \nand sanitation sector based on actual resources available; (b) the institutional \nmechanisms most suitable for delivery of rural water supply, sanitation, and \nhygiene education programs, while clearly defining roles of each stakeholder; (c) \na strategy for effectively mobilizing communities, with specific focus on involving \nwomen; (d) a transparent modality for the flow of funds, both for civil works and \nprocurement;  (e)  an  optimum  strategy  for  O&M,  addressing  institutional  and \nfinancial  sustainability  issues,  as  well  as  the  need  for  major  repairs;  (f) \nsustainable  mechanisms  for  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  (g)  criteria  for \nsubproject selection and levels of subsidy. Other factors may also be considered, \nbased on the discussions of the group. In developing the solutions for each of the \nissues, the consultant/facilitator may use logical frameworks, or other similar \nproject design tools, to guide and focus the process.  \n \n(vii)  The  consultant  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  group  understands  the \nlimitations and general policies of ADB associated with each issue, and that they \nare not ignored when solutions are developed. The consultant is also responsible \nfor focusing the discussion on how to complement, rather than compete, with \nother externally funded projects in the sector. In the event that consensus cannot \nbe reached, despite the best efforts of the facilitator and the group at large, the \nconsultant will incorporate as many of the suggestions as possible in finalizing \nthe summary output.  \n \n(viii)  After all consensus sessions are complete, compile all the outputs into a short \nreport that includes the sector strategy and the project approach and framework \ndeveloped by the group. The report should define the parameters of the water \nsupply, sanitation, and hygiene education programs to be included under the \nensuing project.6 Distribute the document to all participants.  \n \nC.   Phase III: Project Feasibility Assessment and Detailed Design (4 months) \n \n4.  The focus of phase III is to test the feasibility of the project design developed in phase II, \nrefine  it  as  necessary  to  meet  ADB  requirements,  and  complete  all  the  documentation \nnecessary for developing the report and recommendation of the President for the ensuing \nproject. The specific steps associated with this phase are as follows:    \n \n(i)  Develop  standard  letters  of  agreement  for  documenting  arrangements  for \nimplementation of subprojects, cost sharing, and O&M, based on the outputs of \nphase II.  \n \n                                                 \n5  Susskind, Lawrence. 1999.

", "14\nAppendix 2, page 5 \n(ii)  Identify sample subprojects based on criteria defined in phase II, in target areas \nrepresenting the conditions in the terai, hill, and mountain regions. The sample \nwill include subprojects that involve rehabilitation of old systems, as well as the \nconstruction of new ones. Conduct a social assessment and participatory rural \nappraisal in accordance with the methodology developed in phase I. Follow the \nprocesses defined in phase II to consult community groups already in place, or \nformulate new groups if necessary. Reach agreement with communities about \ntechnology options, locations, willingness to pay, and their role in implementing \nwater and sanitation programs.  \n \n(iii)  Complete the technical design for least-cost water supply and sanitation options7 \nselected in consultation with the community, and relevant parties. Develop the \noutline  and  strategy  for  the  hygiene  education  program  to  be  implemented. \nDevelop  a  resettlement  plan  and  compensation  matrix  for  both  private  and \ncommunity land that may have to be acquired.  The land acquisition will be kept \nto a minimum and involuntary resettlement will be avoided, unless there is no \nother option. Explain the final design, cost estimates, resettlement plan, and roles \nand responsibilities to all stakeholders and get commitment and agreement.  \n \n(iv)  Conduct a financial and economic analysis, and poverty impact assessment, and \ndevelop  cost  estimates  for  each  of  the  sample  subprojects  and  the  overall \nproject. Take into account the environmental and health impacts of improved \nwater, sanitation, and hygiene awareness. Pay careful attention to the financial \nviability and sustainability, institutional and financing arrangements, funds flow, \nroles and responsibilities of each stakeholder, and levels of subsidy. \n \n(v)  Prepare an initial environmental examination for each sample subproject, and a \nsummary  for  the  overall  project  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Environmental \nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development Projects and environmental \nassessment requirements.  \n \n(vi)  Define in detail all aspects of the project in accordance with the requirements for \nADB's  new  business  processes.  Explain  links  to  ADB\u2019s  sector  and  country \nstrategies,  and  develop  and  explain  the  subproject  selection  criteria,  project \nframework, chronology, problem/constraints analysis (diagram), sector analysis, \ncost estimates and financing plan, contract packages, implementation schedule, \nfinancial  projections,  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy,  project \nbenefits, impacts and risks, outline terms of reference for consulting services, \nand a realistic framework for benefit monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n(vii)  Other tasks as required by the project officer to assist in preparing the report for \nthe ensuing loan. \n \n                                                 \n7  Consider low-cost options such as rainwater collection where feasible.
