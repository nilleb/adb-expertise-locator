The  Project  will  rehabilitate  140  kilometers  (km)  of  the \nDushanbe-Nurobod section of the transport corridor linking Tajikistan to \nthe Kyrgyz Republic and onward to the PRC, as well as 77 km of rural \nroads serving poor villages. Tajikistan is the poorest country among the \nCentral Asian republics, with a poverty incidence of 83%. The poverty \nincidence in the project area is 91%.  \n   \nRationale  The Project will rehabilitate a key national and international transport \ncorridor. The project road provides the primary link between Dushanbe \nand the Rasht Valley, to the northeast. For several months during the \nwinter, the road also serves as a link between the northern Sugdh \nregion and the rest of Tajikistan. The project area was the scene of \nheavy fighting during Tajikistan\u2019s civil war in the mid-1990s and has a \npoverty incidence of 91%. The improvement of the rural roads will \nimprove access to the main road for poor villages not located on the \nmain  road,  and  therefore  improve  access  to  regional  markets  and \nDushanbe. Numerous agriculture and other poverty alleviation projects \nare  being  implemented  in  the  project  area  by  other  international \norganizations, and by improving transport in the area the Project will \nenable the full potential of these projects to be realized. The Project will \nfacilitate  national  development  and  regional  cooperation  by \nrehabilitating the corridor connecting Afghanistan and Tajikistan to the \nPRC and other countries in the region. The Project will address the \nnational  problem  of  road  maintenance  by  increasing  financing  for \nmaintenance of national roads and developing a maintenance system \nfor rural roads. The Project supports the strategy of the Government \nand Asian Development Bank (ADB) to rehabilitate infrastructure and to \ndevelop international transport corridors. \n   \nObjectives  The objective of the Project is to reduce poverty, by reducing the cost of \nroad transport and improving access to markets, and increase regional \ntrade and cooperation by rehabilitating the road linking Dushanbe to \nNurobod in the Rasht Valley and on to the Kyrgyz Republic and PRC. \nThe Project will (i) reduce transport costs on the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz \nborder road; (ii) provide agricultural and industrial enterprises with all-\nweather access to markets within the country, and eventually abroad; \n(iii) improve access of the rural poor population to market opportunities, \nother economic activities, and social services by improving rural roads; ", "  iii \nother economic activities, and social services by improving rural roads; \nand (iv) strengthen the Government\u2019s institutional capacities for efficient \nmanagement  of  the  national  road  network.  The  Project  will  also \ngenerate employment in construction activities for local residents. The \nProject comprises improvement of about 140 km of the mostly two-lane \nhighway  from  Dushanbe  to  Nurobod,  through  (i)  a  combination  of \nrehabilitation of km 22\u201395, minor rehabilitation of km 95\u2013150, and minor \nworks on the km 9\u201322 section; (ii) improvement of 77 km of rural roads \nin the project area; (iii) consulting services for construction supervision, \nmonitoring and evaluation, implementation of measures to improve road \nsafety,  auditing,  and  project  management;  and  (iv)  procurement  of \nmaintenance equipment for use in routine and periodic maintenance of \nthe improved road sections. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including physical contingencies, price escalation, \nand interest and other charges during construction (but excluding local \ntaxes), is estimated at $23.6 million equivalent, of which $16.8 million \n(71%) is foreign exchange cost and $6.8 million (29%) is local currency \ncost. \n   \nFinancing Plan   \n  ($ million) \n    Foreign  Local  Total \n  Source  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n  ADB  14.4  0.6  15.0 \n  Government  0.3  2.3  2.6 \n  OPEC Fund   2.1  3.9  6.0 \n    Total  16.8  6.8  23.6 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.      \n         \nLoan Amount  A  loan  of  SDR  10,476,000  ($15  million  equivalent)  from  the  Asian \nand Terms  Development Fund will be provided in accordance with ADB\u2019s standard \nterms  and  conditions  for  loans  from  its  Asian  Development  Fund \nresources. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years including a \ngrace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% during the remaining period.  \n   \nPeriod of  Until 31 December 2008 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated  31 December 2007 \nProject \nCompletion \nDate \n   \nImplementation  The project implementation unit currently implementing ADB\u2019s ongoing \nArrangements  Road Rehabilitation Project will be responsible for implementing the \nProject, including the rehabilitation of the sections of the Dushanbe-\nKyrgyz border road and the improvement of the rural roads. \n   ", "iv   \n \nExecuting  Ministry of Transportation \nAgency \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in \n  accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in \nexcess of $500,000 for goods and $1.0 million for civil works will be \nprocured through international competitive bidding. Supply contracts not \nexceeding $500,000 will be procured through international shopping. \nCivil works for rehabilitation of the Vahdat-Faisabod-Obigarm sections \n(km  22\u201395)  have  been  packaged  into  one  contract  and  will  follow \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Civil works for the km 9\u2013\n22 and km 95\u2013150 sections and the rural road improvement component \nwill be procured under local competitive bidding procedures. Supply \ncontracts for the equipment will be packaged based on the technical \nrequirements  of  the  equipment  and  will  be  finalized  during  project \nimplementation.  Advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works  was \napproved at the Management Review Meeting and is under way. \n   \nConsulting  International consulting services for 44 person-months will be provided \nServices  by a firm, for construction supervision, project impact monitoring and \nevaluation,  implementation  of  measures  to  improve  road  safety, \nauditing, and project management. The international consultants will \nalso provide on-the-job training to the counterpart staff and domestic \nconsultants. In association with the international consultants, domestic \nconsulting  services  totaling  300  person-months  will  be  provided  for \nconstruction  supervision,  contract  management,  and  other  technical \nadvisory  assistance;  as  well  as  for  assisting  the  international \nconsultants in monitoring the social and poverty impact of the Project \nthrough household survey and data analysis. The consultants to be \nfinanced under the loan will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The quality- and cost-based selection method will be used \nin selecting the consultants.  \n   \nProject  The Project will reduce transport costs for residents in the project area \nBenefits and  and improve access to markets for agricultural goods, to employment \nBeneficiaries  opportunities, and to social services. The Project will directly affect \n144,000 people in the project area, while 440,000 people live in the four \ndistricts  traversed  by  the  road  (excluding  Dushanbe).  The  primary \neconomic benefits from the Project include savings in vehicle operating \ncosts, domestic and international generated traffic, time savings for \npassenger traffic, and poverty alleviation. Poverty alleviation benefits \narise from the increased prices for agricultural products that will be \nreceived by poor households in the project area. The Project will also \nhave other benefits, which cannot be quantified, including improved \naccess  to  health  and  other  social  services,  improved  access  to \nDushanbe and other areas with more employment opportunities, and \nimproved road safety. The economic internal rate of return is estimated \nto be 15.8%. Due to the competitive nature of the markets for transport \nservices in the project area, most of the benefits from vehicle operating ", "  v\nservices in the project area, most of the benefits from vehicle operating \ncost savings will be passed on to transport users. Most of the users of \npassenger transport services will be residents of the project area, and \nbenefits are allocated using the poverty incidence of 91% in the project \narea. Freight transport users include those living in the project area as \nwell as residents of Dushanbe, with a lower poverty incidence. The \npoverty impact ratio is estimated to be 71%. \n   \nRisks and  The Project has been designed to reduce potential risks. To mitigate the \nAssumptions  risk of implementation delays, the existing project implementation unit \nwill implement the Project and has identified the number and type of \nadditional staff that will be hired to assist. The detailed design has been \ncompleted.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of  the  Government  not  providing \ncounterpart  funds  in  a  timely  manner,  ADB  has  been  conducting \ndialogue  with  the  Government  and  closely  monitoring  planned \ndisbursements  under  the  Public  Investment  Program.  The  risk  of \ninadequate maintenance has been addressed through loan assurances \nrequiring  increasing  levels  of  maintenance  financing  and  through \nprocurement of maintenance equipment for project roads. To mitigate \nthe  risk  that  the  traffic  forecast  will  not  materialize,  especially  the \ninternational generated traffic, it has been assumed that full benefits \nfrom international generated traffic will not be realized until 2012. There \nis no reason to expect that previous United Nations security restrictions \nin the project area will be reimposed. \n   \nTechnical  The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening \nAssistance  Implementation of Road Maintenance, for $600,000 equivalent, to be \nfinanced as a grant from ADB's TA funding program, will develop a \nstrategy and system of maintenance for national and secondary roads, \nmodify  the  maintenance  manual  for  national  roads,  prepare  a \nmaintenance manual for secondary roads, provide training, and conduct \npilot projects for maintenance of secondary roads. \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project \n(Phase I); and (ii) the proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan \nto be provided by the OPEC Fund for International Development for the Project. The report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening  Implementation  of  Road \nMaintenance,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The road subsector is the most important component of domestic transport in Tajikistan. \nThe combined length of Tajikistan\u2019s road network is about 26,000 kilometers (km), consisting of \n4,700  km  of  national  roads  and  21,300  km  of  local  roads.  The  scope  of  the  network  is \nconsidered adequate to accommodate existing traffic levels and support economic growth and \nsustainable development in the medium term. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) has jurisdiction \nover 13,700 km, including all of the national roads and 42% of the local roads (9,000 km). The \nremaining 12,300 km of local roads not under MOT jurisdiction are mostly rural and farm roads. \nThe major part of the network was constructed before 1970, and inadequate maintenance and \ndamage  from  civil  conflict  and  recent  natural  disasters  have  left  it  in  a  state  of  severe \ndeterioration. Of the national roads, 42% are asphalt, 50% are other pavement, and 8% are \ngravel. Many of the asphalt roads are in a seriously deteriorated condition, and in many places \nthe asphalt has been worn away by years of traffic and lack of maintenance. Of the total roads \nin Tajikistan, 20% are estimated to be in fair condition, 48% in poor condition, and 32% in very \npoor condition. Practically none of the roads is estimated to be in good or very good condition. \n  \n3.  The breakup of the former Soviet Union, political and regional instability during the \ncountry\u2019s  civil  war,  and  major  natural  disasters  severely  disrupted  economic  activities  and \ncustomary trade patterns, and resulted in a dramatic decline in transport demand after Tajikistan \ngained its independence in 1991. As Tajikistan\u2019s economy continues to grow, traffic levels are \nexpected to increase; however, it is doubtful that the traffic levels of 1990 will be reached within \nthe  next  10  years.  There  have  been  major  changes  in  Tajikistan\u2019s  vehicle  fleet  since \nindependence. Despite the decrease in traffic levels, there has been a trend of increasing \nprivatization of the road transport fleet and a significant increase in automobile ownership. Of \nabout 180,000 vehicles registered in Tajikistan in 2001, cars comprise about 70% and trucks \ncomprise about 23%. Only about 22% of vehicles are government-owned, mostly trucks, and \nthe majority of them are more than 10 years old. \n \n4.  ADB has been intensively involved in policy dialogue for the transport sector in general, \nand the road subsector in particular, since it began its involvement with the transport sector in \n1998.  The  areas  covered  by  the  policy  dialogue  include  financing  of  road  maintenance, \ncommercialization of transport services, improvement of management efficiency in the transport \nsector by improving key institutions, separation of regulatory and operational functions of the \nsector, and other areas primarily related to the transition to a market economy. Market-oriented \nreforms  for  the  transport  sector  have  been  and  are  now  being  introduced  through \n ", "2   \n \nimplementation of the ADB-financed Road Rehabilitation Project,1 the completed Postconflict \nInfrastructure Program,2 and advisory TA.3 As a result of policy dialogue with and TA from ADB, \nthe administration of the transport sector was reorganized and MOT was created. MOT is now \nresponsible  for  planning  and  coordinating  all  modes  of  transport  within  the  country.  The \norganization chart for MOT is shown in Supplementary Appendix A. In the future most state-\nowned  enterprises  will play  a  minor  role  and  will  be  expected  to  operate  as  independent \ncommercial enterprises. Separate deputy ministers are responsible for rail transport and air \ntransport. These are regulatory and oversight responsibilities only, and the line functions remain \nwith Tajikistan Railway and Tajikistan Airlines. MOT\u2019s Roads Department is responsible for \nadministration, maintenance, and construction of roads in Tajikistan, and has a number of \nassociated entities involved in these activities. Tariffs for road freight have been completely \nderegulated; road haulage organizations enter into agreements with customers at negotiated \nrates. Tariffs for passenger transport are still regulated, but in practice fares vary according to \ncompetition. The project framework for the proposed Project is in Appendix 1. A road subsector \nanalysis, including the Transport Sector Policy Reform Plan, is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  Tajikistan is the poorest country among the Central Asian republics (CARs), with a per \ncapita gross domestic product (GDP) of $166 in 2001 and a poverty incidence of 83%. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social analysis is included in Appendix 3. Average wages are \nless than $1 per day.4 The poverty incidence in the project area is estimated at 91%. The project \nroad provides the only substantial link between the Rasht Valley and the capital Dushanbe, and \ncomprises part of an international corridor to the Kyrgyz Republic and the People's Republic of \nChina (PRC). The Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road traverses four districts with approximately \n440,000 inhabitants, mostly living within 20 km of the road. Approximately 140,000 people will \nbe directly affected by the Project. Of these inhabitants, the majority live in rural areas where the \nincidence of poverty is particularly severe. The improvement of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border \nroad and selected rural roads will improve access to Dushanbe and other cities in which higher \nprices are paid for agricultural products and there are more job opportunities than in the project \narea. The Project will lead to reduced transport costs, most of which will be passed on to \ntransport  users.  Numerous  agriculture  and  other  poverty  alleviation  projects  are  being \nimplemented in the project area by other international organizations, and by improving transport \nin the area the Project will maximize the benefits of these projects.  \n \n6.  The state budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance varies from year to \nyear  according  to  the  Government's  priorities  and  fiscal  constraints.  Prior  to  2000,  road \nsubsector expenditures were financed from the Road Fund, the state budget, and development \nagencies. In January 2000, the Government terminated the Road Fund to meet the International \nMonetary Fund requirement to maintain one consolidated state budget.5 The taxes and receipts \nformerly contributing to the Road Fund are still collected, but now are paid directly to the \nnational treasury. Road maintenance and construction are now funded from the general state \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Technical Assistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for Institutional Strengthening of the Transport and \nEnergy Sectors. Manila. \n4  International Monetary Fund. 2003. Country Report No. 03/10.  \n5  The Road Fund was a first-generation fund, and did not include features such as administration by an independent \nboard found in second-generation funds. (ADB. 2003. Road Funds and Road Maintenance: An Asian Perspective. \nManila.) \n ", "  3\nbudget. The following amounts (in million somoni) have been allocated to the road subsector in \nthe national budget for 2003: 5.3 for maintenance, 10.5 for new construction, and 10.6 for \nrehabilitation, for a total of 26.4. These are approximately equivalent to the following amounts \n(in million dollars): 1.7 for maintenance, 3.4 for new construction, 3.4 for rehabilitation, and 8.5 \ntotal. The total allocations for the road subsector comprise approximately 3% of total planned \nGovernment expenditures for 2003. The annual requirement for maintenance of the 4,700 km of \nnational roads is an estimated $16 million, which is almost twice the total road subsector \nbudget. \n \n7.  Maintenance of the road network throughout Tajikistan virtually ceased following the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union. Maintenance funding was also unavailable during the civil war, \nwhen numerous bridges and road sections were damaged. Funding for road maintenance has \ndecreased substantially since independence, and this inadequate funding is reflected in the \ndeteriorated condition of the road network. Allocation of funding is often restricted to emergency \nmaintenance needs and is insufficient for routine or periodic maintenance requirements. It \nappears that little preventative maintenance is currently being undertaken outside of Dushanbe \nas part of a detailed, planned, and scheduled road maintenance program. MOT is responsible \nfor planning and coordinating the maintenance of the existing road network in the country. MOT \nconducts the maintenance of roads and bridges through five maintenance divisions that are \nresponsible for implementing maintenance activities in their regions. These five divisions are \nresponsible for maintaining approximately 13,700 km of road, and employed 3,291 people in \n2001. The road maintenance divisions are state entities, attached to MOT. \n \n8.  The  Government\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Policy  Statement  outlines  the  policy  directive \nrequiring development of the transport sector to be based on market-oriented reforms and \nrestructuring to improve efficiency. The Government\u2019s strategy for the road subsector is to \nrehabilitate and maintain the road infrastructure and to develop an efficient road transport \nindustry through an increased role for the private sector in providing transport services, greater \nreliance on cost recovery to finance road maintenance, and rehabilitation of the critical parts of \nthe road network and transport services that remain under state control. The Government aims \nto increase expenditures on road maintenance, and has been doing so in line with ADB's policy \ndialogue,  and  to  implement  necessary  changes  to  the  regulatory  framework  to  encourage \ngreater involvement by the private sector in road transport. The Government\u2019s strategy includes \nthe  development  of  international  road  corridors  to  facilitate  Tajikistan\u2019s  trade  with  other \ncountries. \n \n9.  The  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in  implementing  its  strategy  for  the  road \nsubsector and will address the problems and opportunities related to poverty reduction and road \nmaintenance. During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its \nrequest for assistance for the Project. ADB provided TA for conducting a feasibility study for the \nProject.6 Fact-finding for the Project was conducted during 11\u201321 February 2003, and appraisal \nwas conducted during 7\u201316 June 2003. The Project was formulated based on the findings of the \nADB  missions,  information  provided  by  the  Government,  beneficiary  consultations,  and \nrecommendations of the feasibility study and TA consultants. The Project will contribute to the \nachievement of two of the objectives of ADB\u2019s Interim Operating Strategy for Tajikistan, namely, \n(i) assisting in postconflict rehabilitation and reconstruction, and (ii) facilitating the country\u2019s \ntransition to a market economy. In addition, infrastructure (especially roads and power) is one of \nthe three areas on which the interim operational strategy focuses. \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Second Road Rehabilitation Project. Manila. ", "4   \n \n10.  ADB has provided the largest amount of assistance to the road subsector of any of the \ninternational organizations (Appendix 4). The Islamic Development Bank has financed two road \nprojects for a total of about $19 million, and the Kuwait Fund has provided about $16 million. \nThe OPEC Fund and Saudi Fund have provided smaller amounts for road projects. The World \nBank has financed infrastructure rehabilitation projects that include roads as well as other \ninfrastructure. \n \nC.  Lessons Learned \n \n11.  The project design incorporates lessons learned from ADB\u2019s loan and TA operations in \ngeneral, ADB\u2019s road subsector operations in Tajikistan, and other projects and TAs in the CARs. \nOne of the lessons learned from ADB\u2019s impact evaluation study on rural roads and poverty \nreduction7 is that the long-term benefits of road projects can be threatened by neglecting road \nmaintenance. The study recommends devolving responsibility for road maintenance to local \ncommunities, particularly for rural roads, as a means of ensuring long-term sustainability. The \nProject is addressing the importance of road maintenance in general through loan covenants \nrequiring specified levels of financing for road maintenance (for the national road network as \nwell as for project roads) and purchasing maintenance equipment to be used on the project \nroads. In addition, the advisory TA associated with the project will be developing a maintenance \nsystem for rural roads, including community-based maintenance. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s TA Performance Audit Report on Institutional Strengthening and Policy Support to \nthe Road Sector in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Mongolia8 found that the scope of TAs \nshould be achievable within the given timeframe. The report also found that there is a need to \nincrease expenditures on road maintenance in the three CARs on which it focused. These \nrecommendations have been incorporated into the project design through (i) providing a 24-\nmonth duration for implementation of the advisory TA, and (ii) including loan assurances to \nincrease financing for road maintenance (para 58 [iii]). \n \n13.  ADB is currently implementing the Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 1) in Tajikistan. \nAlthough this project is still under implementation, some lessons may be learned. The Road \nRehabilitation  Project  has  experienced  some  delays  in  implementation,  although  it  is  now \nproceeding without problems. The delays were mainly due to (i) lack of advance procurement \naction, (ii) a delay in declaring the loan effective, and (iii) the detailed design being prepared by \nthe supervision consultants under the project. Since there was no advance action under the first \nproject, the supervision consultants (who were to prepare the detailed design) could not be \nrecruited until the loan had been declared effective. The delays in loan effectiveness therefore \nled to further delays in preparing the detailed design and procurement of the civil works. A \nlesson  related  to  the  policy  dialogue  from  the  ongoing  project  is  that  funding  of  road \nmaintenance remains a problem given the difficult fiscal situation in Tajikistan. These lessons \nhave been incorporated into the project design. Advance action for the proposed Project was \napproved at the Management Review Meeting and is under way, and the detailed design has \nbeen completed. The project implementation unit (PIU) implementing the ongoing project is \nfunctioning well, and will implement the proposed Project (with the assistance of additional \nstaff). Finally, the Government and ADB have agreed on loan assurances that will provide \nadequate financing to maintain the roads rehabilitated under the Project as well as significant \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2002.

ADB has also implemented a program loan for the transport and energy sectors, as well \nas an emergency infrastructure rehabilitation project focusing on damaged roads, bridges, and \nother infrastructure. The program completion report for the program loan (footnote 2) found that, \nwhile there were substantial achievements, the extensive program of policy reforms in the \ntransport  and  energy  sectors  was  too  ambitious.9  The  primary  lesson  learned  was  that \ncovenants should be tailored to the capability of a country to achieve them. To incorporate this \nlesson, the policy reform agenda of the proposed Project focuses on one crucial area, financing \nof road maintenance, and the Government and ADB carried out an extensive dialogue to ensure \nthat Tajikistan is capable of implementing the loan assurances.  \n \nD.  Project Rationale \n  \n15.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  a  key  national  and  international  transport  corridor  in \nTajikistan. The project road provides the primary link between Dushanbe and the Rasht Valley, \nto the northeast. For several months during the winter, the road also serves as a link between \nthe northern Sugdh region and the rest of Tajikistan. The project area was the scene of heavy \nfighting during Tajikistan\u2019s civil war in the mid-1990s and has a poverty incidence of 91%. The \nimprovement of the rural roads will improve access to the main road for poor villages not located \non the main road, and therefore improve access to regional markets and Dushanbe. Numerous \nagriculture and other poverty alleviation projects are being implemented in the project area by \nother international organizations, and by improving transport in the area the Project will enable \nthe full potential of these projects to be realized. The Project will facilitate national development \nand regional cooperation by rehabilitating the corridor connecting Afghanistan and Tajikistan to \nthe PRC and other countries in the region. The project road eventually connects to Sary Tash in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, and to the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road corridor currently being studied \nunder ADB's TA for Regional Cooperation in Transport Projects in Central Asia.10 The Project \nwill address the national problem of road maintenance by increasing financing for maintenance \nof national roads and developing a maintenance system for rural roads. The Project supports \nthe  strategy  of  the  Government  and  ADB  to  rehabilitate  infrastructure  and  to  develop \ninternational  transport  corridors.  The  second  phase  of  the  rehabilitation  of  the  road  from \nDushanbe to the Kyrgyz border is included in ADB's Tajikistan program as a firm loan for 2005. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n16.  The objective of the Project is reduce poverty, by reducing the cost of road transport and \nimproving access to markets, and to increase regional trade and cooperation by rehabilitating \nthe road linking Dushanbe to Nurobod (Darband) in the Rasht Valley and on to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and the PRC. The Project will (i) reduce transport costs on the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz \nborder  road;  (ii)  provide  agricultural  and  industrial  enterprises  with  all-weather  access  to \nmarkets  within  the  country,  and  eventually  abroad;  (iii)  improve  access  of  the  rural  poor \npopulation to market opportunities, other economic activities, and social services by improving \nrural  roads;  and  (iv)  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  institutional  capacities  for  efficient \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2002.

The Project comprises \n \n  (i)  improvement of about 140 km of the mostly two-lane highway from Dushanbe to \nNurobod,  through  a  combination  of  rehabilitation  of  km  22\u201395,  minor \nrehabilitation of km 95\u2013150, and minor works on the km 9\u201322 section; \n \n  (ii)  improvement of 77 km of rural roads in the project area;  \n \n  (iii)  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nimplementation  of  measures  to  improve  road  safety,  auditing,  and  project \nmanagement; and \n \n  (iv)  procurement  of  maintenance  equipment  for  use  in  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance of all of the improved road sections. \n \n18.  The main project road is a two-lane national highway, with the exception of the km 9\u201322 \nsection  which  has  four  lanes.  The  condition  of  the  road  varies  widely  depending  on  past \nmaintenance activity and geological conditions. The conditions on the km 22\u201395 section range \nfrom  areas  in  which  only  the  surface  pavement  has  deteriorated  to  areas  requiring \nreconstruction.  The  works  on  this  section  include  reconstruction  work  in  a  landslide  area, \nrehabilitation of substantially deteriorated asphalt surfaces, and surface treatment of pavement \nin some locations. The km 95\u2013150 section passes through mountainous terrain and has not \nbeen maintained. On this section, the Project will complete minor rehabilitation works, such as \ninstallation of slope protection and safety facilities, as well as maintenance activities including \nwork to prevent further major rock falls. The minor works on the km 9\u201322 section comprise \nroutine maintenance activities only. The conditions of the rural roads vary by location, and the \nworks on these roads will include machine grading, profiling of gravel roads, repair of potholes, \nand patching of asphalt surfaces. In addition, five seriously deteriorated bridges will be replaced. \nAll  the  project  works  have  been  designed  to  comply  with  the  highway  design  standards \ndeveloped  under  ADB\u2019s  TA  on  road  design  standards  in  the  CARs.11  The  maintenance \nequipment procured under the Project will become the property of MOT and will be distributed to \nroad maintenance units. \n \n19.  In addition, an accompanying advisory TA will be provided to improve the maintenance \nof national and rural roads (paras. 41\u201343).  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Maximizing Poverty Impact \n \n20.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  maximize  the  poverty  reduction  impact  through \nimproving rural roads and encouraging the hiring of poor residents and women in the project \narea to work on the Project. The improvement of the rural roads will expand the benefits of the \nrehabilitation of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road to poor villages located in the project area \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance for A Review of Road Design and Construction Standards. Manila. \n ", "  7\nbut not directly on the main road, focusing on the most poverty stricken areas. The 77 km of \nrural roads included in the Project were selected based on the following criteria: (i) geographic \nlocation,  (ii)  poverty  and  social  considerations,  (iii)  economic  and  traffic  criteria,  (iv) \nsustainability, and (v) opportunities for cooperation with other poverty-alleviation projects in the \narea. During the selection process, discussions were held with MOT, local government officials, \nand residents of rural villages. Improvement of rural roads will provide these poor villages with \nimproved access to the main highway, and thus improved access to markets and urban areas. \nThe improvement of the rural roads as well as the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road will lower the \ncosts of transporting agricultural inputs to the poor areas and transporting agricultural outputs to \nmarkets, thereby improving the terms of trade for poor farmers in the project area. Improvement \nof the rural roads will also improve access to job opportunities in Dushanbe and elsewhere in \nthe project area. Access to social services will also be improved; for example, ambulances are \nno longer operated in some areas because of the poor quality of the roads. \n \n21.  The poverty impact of the Project will also be maximized through complementarity with \nother poverty-reduction projects. A large number of income-generating projects, especially in \nthe agriculture sector, are being implemented by nongovernment organizations (NGO) and \nother development agencies in the project area. The Cooperative for Assistance and Relief \nEverywhere,  Inc.  (CARE)  International's  Women\u2019s  Economic  Opportunity  Project  in  Vahdat \n(Kofarnikhon) and other areas has helped form women's groups and federations and provided \nthem with credit totaling about TJS200,000 for income-generating activities including poultry \nproduction and livestock raising. The CARE project has also provided training to women in other \nincome-generating  activities  such  as  sewing,  knitting,  and  production  of  baskets.  ADB\u2019s \nTajikistan Rural Poverty Reduction Project,12 under implementation by CARE International in \nVahdat and other areas, has helped more than 100 farmers\u2019 associations and women\u2019s groups \nand has provided about TJS300,000 of credit to these organizations for purchasing agricultural \ninputs and livestock. This project is also funding irrigation projects and providing agricultural \ntechnical training. German Agro Action is implementing the Seed and Fertilizer Agricultural \nRehabilitation  Project,  funded  by  the  European  Commission,  which  provides  farmers  in \nFaisabod, Nurobod, Vahdat, and other areas, with high-quality seeds on a reimbursable basis. \nA representative list of other income-generating projects is included in Supplementary Appendix \nB. By lowering transport costs and improving access to markets, the Project\u2019s rehabilitation of \nthe Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road and rural roads will maximize the income received from the \ngoods produced with the assistance of these income-generating projects in the project area. \n \n22.  The Project will encourage the hiring of poor people from the project area for unskilled \nand  semi-skilled  labor.  The  Project  will  also  encourage  the  hiring  of  women  who  head \nhouseholds, especially those whose husbands were killed or severely disabled in the civil war, \nas well as disadvantaged women in general. While the employment opportunities from the \nProject will only yield short-term direct benefits to the poor, the indirect impacts on poverty will \nbe  longer-term.  According  to  surveys  conducted  by  the  TA  consultants  and  the  project-\nprocessing missions, about two thirds of the residents of the communities on the rural roads to \nbe rehabilitated under the Project are indebted, and the income from employment can be used \nto pay off these debts. The residents also indicated that they would use the income from short-\nterm  employment  to  invest  in  income-generating  activities  such  as  processing  of  locally-\nproduced fruit and dairy products and purchase of livestock. \n \n \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for Rural Poverty Reduction Project. Manila. ", "8   \n \n2.  Policy Dialogue and Road Maintenance Financing \n \n23.  ADB has been intensively involved in policy dialogue for the transport sector in general, \nand the road subsector in particular, since it began its involvement with Tajikistan's transport \nsector in 1998. Financing of road maintenance is one of the key topics that has been addressed \nin the policy dialogue. As part of the covenants for the Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 1), \nthe Government agreed to increase budget allocations for maintenance and rehabilitation of \nroads under MOT administration by 10% per year plus inflation during 2002 to 2004. The \nGovernment has complied with the required 10% annual increase (plus inflation) in budget \nallocations for road maintenance and rehabilitation.13 Allocations for road maintenance have \nincreased at an average annual rate of 29% since 2001. The Government also agreed that \nfunding  for road  maintenance  would  account  for  50%,  60%,  and  65%  of  the  total  budget \nallocation for road maintenance and new construction in the years 2001, 2002, and 2003, \nrespectively. According to budget data provided by MOT and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), \nbudget allocations for road maintenance have accounted for 57%, 36%, and 60% of the total \nbudget  allocation  for  road  maintenance  and  new  construction  in  2001,  2002,  and  2003, \nrespectively. The Government thus exceeded the covenant in 2001, fell substantially short in \n2002, and failed to comply by a small amount in 2003. The failures to comply are due to \nsubstantial  increases  in  spending  on  construction  of  the  Anzob  Tunnel  (a  national  priority \nproject) in 2002 and 2003. The Government requested a modification of the requirement for the \nmaintenance financing proportion for 2004 (70%) so that it is consistent with the assurances for \n2005\u20132007 in the proposed Project (para. 24). ADB approved the request. \n \n24.  For the proposed Project, the Government has agreed to ensure that annual budget \nallocations  and  actual  expenditures  for  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  (excluding  new \nconstruction) of roads under MOT\u2019s jurisdiction will be increased by no less than 15% per year \nin 2005\u20132007. Based on the amount allocated for road rehabilitation and maintenance in 2003, \nthis covenant will result in expenditures on road rehabilitation and maintenance reaching TJS28 \nmillion (approximately $9 million) in 2007.  The Government will also establish a separate \nbudget  item  for  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  the  Dushanbe-Kyrgyz  border  road.  The \nGovernment will allocate $40,000 per year (plus inflation since 2003) for maintenance of the \nrehabilitated sections of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road, following handover of these sections \nby the contractor. The Government will also ensure that the rural roads rehabilitated under the \nProject  are  adequately  maintained.  Furthermore,  the  Government  has  agreed  that  actual \nexpenditures for road maintenance and rehabilitation will account for no less than 80% of the \ntotal budget allocation for road maintenance and rehabilitation and new construction (excluding \nexpenditures for construction of the Anzob Tunnel) during 2005\u20132007. This differs from the \ncovenant  under  the  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  by  excluding  expenditures  for  the  Anzob \nTunnel. The Government considers construction of the Anzob Tunnel to be a national priority \nproject, and is actively seeking grant financing from bilateral sources. ADB's policy dialogue on \nroad maintenance financing will ensure the maintenance and sustainability of roads rehabilitated \nunder  the  Project,  and  will  also  increase  overall  financing  for  road  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance, to the extent possible given fiscal constraints and the national priority project. \n \n25.  In addition to the intensive policy dialogue on financing of road maintenance, ADB\u2019s \npolicy dialogue for the transport sector in general has covered all subsectors and numerous \nissues.  The  covenants  for  the  ongoing  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  1)  include  a \nnumber  of  covenants  that  were  originally  part  of  the  Postconflict  Infrastructure  Program \n                                                 \n13 Inflation rates were 38.6% and 12.2% in 2001 and 2002, respectively. ADB. 2003. Tajikistan Country Strategy and \nProgram (2004-2008). Manila. \n ", "  9\n(footnote 2). While the Government has complied with a number of these covenants, particularly \nthose related to implementation of the Transport Law, the Government has not fully complied \nwith four covenants, relating primarily to corporatization of the railway and aviation sectors, \nalthough progress has been made towards compliance with these as well. The Government, in \na letter of 6 October 2003, formally requested modifications and waivers of the outstanding \ncovenants. In particular, the Government requested an extension of the dates for compliance \nwith two outstanding covenants related to Tajik Rail and waivers of two other outstanding \ncovenants, which are the subject of policy dialogue with other international organizations as \ndiscussed in Appendix 2. ADB has approved the Government's request. \n \n26.  In  addition  to  increasing  financing  for  road  maintenance,  ADB  has  also  focused  on \nimproving  the  Government\u2019s  technical  capacity  for  conducting  road  maintenance.  Road \nmaintenance equipment is being procured under the Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 1), and \nadditional maintenance equipment will be procured under the proposed Project. A manual for \nroutine maintenance of national roads was developed under ADB TA,14 and will be updated under \nthe  proposed  advisory  TA  (paras.  41\u201343).  The  Project  will  also  address  maintenance  of \nsecondary roads. The advisory TA will develop a manual for maintenance of secondary roads \nincluding  a  community-based  maintenance  system.  The  TA  also  includes  training  of  road \nmaintenance personnel and implementation of pilot projects to maintain the rural roads. The \nmaintenance equipment procured under the Project will also be used to maintain the rural roads \nrehabilitated under the Project. \n \n3.  Regional Cooperation \n \n27.  The Project is also important from a regional perspective and contributes to ADB\u2019s \nregional  cooperation  strategy  in  Central  Asia.  After  reaching  the  border  with  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic, the road leads directly to Sary Tash. Sary Tash is on the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam \nroad corridor, which links Uzbekistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and the PRC. This corridor is \ncurrently being studied under TA 6024-REG: Regional Cooperation in Transport Projects in \nCentral  Asia  (footnote  10),  and  is  part  of  the  larger  corridor  connecting  to  Tashkent  in \nUzbekistan (408 km west of Osh), and to Kashgar in the PRC (240 km east of Irkeshtam). The \nrehabilitation of the first phase of the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road is included in ADB\u2019s 2004 \nprogram for the Kyrygz Republic. \n \n28.  To the south of Dushanbe, the Project connects with ADB\u2019s Road Rehabilitation Project \n(footnote 1), which is rehabilitating sections of the Dushanbe-Kurgan Tyube-Dangara-Khulyab \nroad. From Kurgan Tyube, there is a road to the border of Afghanistan. The United States \nGovernment has agreed to finance a bridge across the Pyanzh River, connecting Tajikistan to \nAfghanistan. Thus, the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road to be improved by the Project forms part \nof the corridor that will eventually link Afghanistan and Tajikistan to the PRC, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, and other countries in the region. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n29.  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $23.6  million  equivalent  (including  physical \ncontingencies, price escalation, and interest and other charges during construction) of which \n$16.8 million (71.2%) is foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost is estimated at $6.8 \nmillion equivalent, or about 28.8% of the total cost.

Financing Plan \n \n30.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan from its Asian Development Fund \nresources in an amount equivalent to $15 million to finance 85.7% of the foreign exchange cost \nof the Project. The ADB loan will represent 63.6% of the total cost of the Project, including \ncontingencies and interest charge on the loan during construction. The terms and conditions of \nthe loan will be ADB\u2019s standard terms and conditions for loans from its Asian Development Fund \nresources. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, \nand  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the grace  period  and  1.5%  during  the \nremaining period. The Government and cofinancier will finance the remaining foreign and entire \nlocal currency cost. The OPEC Fund will provide cofinancing equivalent to $6.0 million to \nfinance the foreign exchange and local currency cost of the civil works on a joint basis with \nADB.15 The OPEC Fund cofinancing will have a maturity of 20 years, including a grace period of \n5 years, an interest rate of 1% per annum, and a service charge of 1% per annum. In the event \nthat cofinancing is not available, the Government and ADB will agree on reductions to the scope \nof work sufficient to cover the shortfall. The Borrower will be the Republic of Tajikistan. The \nGovernment  has  given  its  assurance  that  adequate  local  counterpart  funds  will  be  made \navailable from the State Budget or other sources as necessary to enable the Project to be \nimplemented in a timely manner. MOF assured the Mission that it would be able to provide the \nrequired counterpart funds for the Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 1) and the proposed \nProject  simultaneously.  In  case  of  escalation  of  prices  or  required  quantities  covered  by \ncontingencies, the increase will be split between the Government and ADB according to the \nfinancing percentages of the overall project costs, subject always to the maximum loan amount. \nThe proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 2 and shown in Appendix 5. \n \n                                                 \n15 The OPEC Fund cofinancing is scheduled for consideration by the OPEC Fund Board in December 2003. \n ", " 11\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent of \nSource  Exchange Currency  Cost  Project Cost \nADB    14.4    0.6     15.0    63.6 \nGovernment    0.3    2.3    2.6    11.0 \nOPEC Fund    2.1    3.9    6.0    25.4 \n  Total    16.8    6.8    23.6    100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Organization and Management \n \n31.  The organizational arrangement existing under the Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote \n1) will remain effective for the proposed Project. The deputy minister of MOT will have overall \nresponsibility  for  project  management,  including  approval  of  contracts  and  payments.  The \nexisting PIU will (i) monitor the progress of day-to-day project implementation, (ii) prepare \nwithdrawal applications, (iii) prepare project progress reports, and (iv) maintain project accounts \nand complete loan financial records for auditing the Project. The executive project director, \nacceptable to ADB, with adequate experience in project management, will be responsible for the \nday-to-day  supervision  of  implementation  activities.  The  executive  project  director  will  be \nsupported by a group of professional and clerical staff with expertise and experience in financial \naccounting,  road  engineering,  construction  supervision,  contract  administration,  and \nimplementation of resettlement plans. Four additional staff will be added to the PIU to ensure \nthat it has sufficient capacity to implement both ADB road projects simultaneously.  \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n32.  The Project will be implemented in 3.3 years from September 2004 to December 2007 \nincluding mobilization but excluding the defects liability period (the period during which the \ncontractor is responsible for maintenance). The civil works for the project road are scheduled to \nbegin in October 2004 and be completed in December 2007. The proposed implementation \nschedule is shown in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n33.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in excess of $500,000 for goods and $1.0 \nmillion  for  civil  works  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Supply \ncontracts not exceeding $500,000 will be procured through international shopping. Civil works \nfor rehabilitation of the Vahdat-Faisabod-Obigarm sections (km 22\u201395) have been packaged \ninto  one  contract,  which  will  be  financed  jointly  by  ADB  and  the  OPEC  Fund  following \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures,  to  encourage  participation  of  international \ncompetitors and joint ventures by international and domestic contractors. Civil works for the km \n9\u201322 and km 95\u2013150 sections and the rural road improvement component will be procured \nunder local competitive bidding to maximize the use of local labor. Supply contracts for the \nequipment will be packaged based on the technical requirements of the equipment and will be \nfinalized during project implementation. Tentative contract packages are listed in Appendix 7. ", "12  \n \nAdvance procurement action was approved by ADB at the Management Review Meeting on 14 \nMay 2003 and is now under way. \n \n4.  Consulting Services  \n \n34.  International consulting services for 44 person-months will be provided by a firm, for \nconstruction supervision, project impact monitoring and evaluation, implementation of measures \nto improve road safety, auditing, and project management. The international consultants will \nalso provide on-the-job training to the counterpart staff and domestic consultants. In association \nwith the international consultants, domestic consulting services totaling 300 person-months will \nbe provided for construction supervision, contract management and other technical advisory \nassistance; as well as for helping the international consultants monitor the social and poverty \nimpact  of  the  Project  through  household  surveys  and  data  analysis.  Sufficient  domestic \nconsulting services are available in Tajikistan. The consultants to be financed under the loan will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. A \nfull technical proposal will be required for the consulting services, and the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method will be used in selecting the consultants. The terms of reference for the \nconsulting services are given in Appendix 8. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n35.  All disbursements under the loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  The  disbursement  procedures  will  include  (i)  a  direct  payment \nprocedure, (ii) a commitment procedure, or (iii) a reimbursement procedure.  \n \n6.  Advance Action \n \n36.  In view of the high priority accorded to the Project by the Government and in order to \nminimize  implementation  delays  and  ensure  the  timely  completion  of  the  Project,  the \nGovernment requested ADB approval for advance procurement action for civil works packages \nand advance recruitment action for international consultants. The advance actions, up to but not \nincluding signing of contracts, will cover (i) prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid \nevaluation for the civil works contract packages; and (ii) recruitment of international consultants \nto help implement the Project. ADB approved advance procurement action at the Management \nReview Meeting on 14 May 2003. The Government has been advised that ADB's approval of \nthe advance actions does not commit ADB to approve the Project or finance any procurement \ncosts. \n \n7.  Midterm Review \n \n37.  ADB and the Government will carry out a midterm review of project implementation in \n2005.  The  review  will  focus  on  project  impacts,  particularly  those  relating  to  institutional, \nadministrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects  and  poverty \nreduction. The Project\u2019s economic viability and other relevant aspects that may have an impact \non project performance will also be assessed during the review. The review will also examine \nthe implementation progress for the policy reforms and compliance with assurances specified in \nthe Loan Agreement. \n \n \n ", " 13\n8.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit \n \n38.  MOT will prepare and submit to ADB and the cofinancier monthly, quarterly, and annual \nprogress reports on project implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed with \nADB. MOT will maintain separate accounts for all project components financed by ADB, the \ncofinancier, and the Government and have them audited by an independent auditor that has \nadequate knowledge and experience of international accounting practices and is acceptable to \nADB. The audited Project accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be furnished to ADB within 9 \nmonths after the end of each financial year. The Government has been informed of ADB\u2019s \nrequirement on the timely submission of audited project accounts and financial statements, \nincluding  the  suspension  of  disbursements  in  case  of  noncompliance.  To  facilitate \npostevaluation of the Project, the Government has agreed to provide a project completion report \nto ADB, within 3 months of physical completion of the Project. \n \n9.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n39.  A preliminary set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the \nProject in relation to its goals and purposes, with an emphasis on poverty reduction, has been \nagreed upon with MOT. A draft project performance management system containing these \nindicators  is  included  in  Appendix  9,  with  data  for  the  monitoring  indicators  included  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  C.  At  the  beginning  of  project  implementation,  MOT  will  confirm \nbaseline values for social, environmental, and poverty reduction impact indicators. Monitoring \nindicators  will  be  measured,  with  the  necessary  frequency,  during  project  implementation. \nComments and findings regarding these project indicators will be incorporated in every other \nquarterly report to ADB. In addition to indicators for implementation monitoring, indicators for \nproject evaluation will be measured at project completion and 3 years after completion. Where \nrelevant, indicators will be disaggregated by gender. Participatory surveys will take place and \nresults will be compared with the baseline. A final report will consist of an evaluation of changes \nthat occurred in the preceding 3 years. MOT has developed its monitoring capability for the \nongoing project, and has the capacity to monitor the proposed Project as well. In addition, to \nfacilitate  assessment  of  the  socioeconomic  and  environmental  impact  of  the  Project,  an \ninternational consultant will be recruited to monitor and evaluate all relevant project impacts. \n \n10.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n40.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to the officials of the Government during \nproject processing. The Government is committed to creating and sustaining a corruption-free \nenvironment, and has agreed to abide by the relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \nin preparing all documents and contracts during the bidding process and during implementation \nof the Project. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n41.  The Government has requested ADB to provide an advisory and operational TA16 to \ndevelop a strategy for and system of maintenance for national and secondary roads, including a \nsystem of community-based maintenance for rural roads. The TA will require approximately 20 \nperson-months of international and 60 person-months of domestic consulting services, with \nexpertise in maintenance of national and secondary roads and development of community-\nbased  maintenance  systems,  technical  training,  and  working  with  NGOs.  Draft  terms  of \n                                                 \n16 The proposed TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 24 April 2003. ", "14  \n \nreference for the TA are included in Appendix 10. It will be recommended that the consultants \nconsider  using  NGOs  to  perform  some  of  the  domestic  consulting  services  related  to \nmaintenance of secondary roads. \n  \n42.  The total TA cost is estimated to be $706,000 equivalent comprising a foreign exchange \ncost of $427,000 and a local currency cost of $279,000 equivalent. A TA grant of $600,000 \nequivalent is proposed for ADB financing to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of $427,000 \nand $173,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant \nbasis by ADB's TA funding program. The remaining local cost of $106,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced by the Government. \n \n43.  \u041c\u041e\u0422 will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will be responsible for the day-to-day \nimplementation activities, including liaison and coordination with other concerned Government \ndepartments or agencies. The TA will be implemented in 24 months beginning in April 2005. \nThe TA is expected to be completed by 31 March 2007. A simplified technical proposal will be \nrequired for the consulting services, and the consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB \nusing the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with \u0410D\u0412\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Benefits \n \n1.  Traffic Forecast \n \n44.  Traffic forecasts were prepared for the sections of the project road based on forecast \nGDP  growth,  population  growth,  and  income  elasticities  of  demand  during  2003\u20132027 \n(Appendix 11). GDP is forecast to grow at annual rates of 5% through 2012 and 4% for the \nremainder of the project period, and population is expected to increase at an average annual \ngrowth rate of 1.6% per year during the project period. Average annual traffic growth rates for \ntrucks, buses, and cars are estimated at 6.5%, 4.6% and 6.3%, respectively, during 2003\u20132012, \nand 4.0%, 3.5%, and 4.7% for the remainder of the project period. In 2027, total vehicles per \nday  are  forecast  to  range  from  19,839  on  the  Dushanbe-Vahdat  section  to  4,922  on  the \nObigarm-Nurobod section. International generated traffic, arising from increased trade between \nTajikistan and the PRC, is expected to start in 2010 following completion of other road projects, \nto reach full levels in 2012, and to comprise 61%\u201372% of total traffic in 2027 except for 14% on \nthe Dushanbe-Vahdat section. At present, about 50% of Tajikistan\u2019s imports from the PRC \nconsist of fabric, chemicals, cotton, and tea; while cotton comprises about 70% of Tajikistan\u2019s \nexports to the PRC. Trade between the two countries is expected to increase following the \ncompletion of other road projects and associated cross-border trade agreements. In particular, \nthe PRC is expected to provide a large market for Tajikistan\u2019s agricultural output and to become \na large source of consumer goods for Tajikistan. \n \n2.  Economic Internal Rate of Return and Distribution Analysis \n \n45.  The economic analysis was carried out for each section of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border \nroad and the rural roads included in the Project on the basis of a comparison of the with- and \nwithout-project scenarios. In the without-project scenario, the road is assumed to receive only \nminimal maintenance and will continue to deteriorate. The with-project scenario assumes that, \nfollowing  completion  of  the  Project,  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  will  be  carried  out \naccording to international standards. During the project preparatory TA (footnote 6), various \n ", " 15\nproject design alternatives were considered, and the project design is based on the least cost \noption. \n \n46.  Project  economic  costs  include  the  resource  costs  of  road  improvement  and \nmaintenance,  including  rural  road  improvement,  maintenance  equipment,  and  consulting \nservices.  The  quantifiable  economic  benefits  from  the  Project  include  savings  in  vehicle \noperating  costs  (VOCs),  domestic  and  international  generated  traffic,  time  savings  for \npassenger travel, and poverty alleviation benefits. Economic benefits were calculated applying \nthe same methodology used for costs. Domestic generated traffic comprises new traffic induced \nfrom the reduction in VOCs as a result of the improvement of the road, and the benefits are \ncalculated using 50% of the VOC savings for existing traffic. International generated traffic \narises from increased trade between Tajikistan and the PRC. These benefits will not begin to \naccrue until 2010, following completion of other sections of the road to the PRC, and will not be \nfully  realized  until  2012.  Poverty  alleviation  benefits  arise  from  the  increased  prices  for \nagricultural products that will be realized by poor households in the project area. The Project will \nlead to higher prices for the products as the improvement of the project roads facilitates the \nshipment of goods to Dushanbe and other markets as well as increased travel to the project \narea  by  traders  buying  produce  to  sell  elsewhere.  VOC  savings  for  existing  traffic  and \ninternational generated traffic are the most significant sources of benefits, accounting for about \n53% and 37% of total benefits, respectively. The Project will also have other benefits, which \ncannot be quantified due to insufficient information. These include improved access to health \nand  other  social  services,  improved  access  to  Dushanbe  and  other  areas  with  more \nemployment opportunities, and improved road safety. \n \n47.  Economic internal rates of return (EIRR) and net present values were calculated for the \nfour sections of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road, for the combined group of rural roads, and \nfor the overall Project (Appendix 12). The EIRR for the overall Project is 15.8%, and the net \npresent value is $6.4 million. The EIRRs for the four sections of the main road and the rural \nroads component range from 12.0% to 32.3%. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the \neffects of negative changes in the key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the \nProject. Sensitivity analysis indicates that capital costs would have to increase by 42% or \nbenefits would have to decrease by 29% for the EIRR to decline to the cutoff level of 12%. \nGiven ADB\u2019s experience with other road improvement projects in the CARs, changes of such \nmagnitude are not expected to occur. \n \n48.  Distribution analysis was carried out in order to examine the Project\u2019s impact on the \npoor. Net project benefits were distributed among (i) users of freight transport, (ii) users of \npassenger transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) labor, and (v) the government and economy of \nTajikistan. Although bus fares are formally regulated, there appears to be free competition \namong operators in the project area. Therefore, it is assumed that savings in VOCs for buses on \nthe project road will be passed on as lower fares. As the trucking industry in Tajikistan is \ndominated by the private sector, and there is a high level of competition on the project road, \nmost of the reduction in VOCs is likely to be passed on to users as lower transport charges. \nTherefore, most of the benefits from VOC savings are also passed on to transport users. \nInternational generated traffic arises from increased trade, and these benefits are allocated to \nthe economy in general. The largest beneficiaries were users of freight transport, followed by \nusers of passenger transport. \n \n \n ", "16  \n \nB.  Impact on Poverty \n \n49.  The main causes of poverty in the project area are unemployment and the low prices \nreceived for agricultural produce. The Project will contribute to poverty alleviation by addressing \nboth of these causes (paras. 20\u201322). The improvement of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road as \nwell as the rural roads will improve access to Dushanbe and other locations in which higher \nprices are paid for agricultural products and there are more job opportunities than in the project \narea. Reductions in transport costs will be passed on to the users of the transport services, \nthereby improving the terms of trade for poor farmers in the project area by lowering the costs of \nagricultural  inputs  and  increasing  prices  for  agricultural  outputs.  In  addition,  the  improved \ntransport services should increase the number of traders traveling to the project area to buy \nproduce. Many other income generating projects are being implemented by other agencies and \ninternational organizations in the project area, and the improved transport from the Project will \nenable the full potential of these other projects to be realized. The Project\u2019s civil works will \nrequire  approximately  4,400  person-months  of  unskilled  labor.  The  Project  will  encourage \ncontractors to hire poor residents of the project area to fill these unskilled labor positions. \n \n50.  The poverty impact ratio has been calculated to illustrate the poverty impact of the \nProject. The proportion of benefits accruing to the poor has been estimated for all the benefits \nallocated by the distribution analysis. Benefits to freight and passenger transport users have \nbeen allocated according to the proportion of transport users that are poor. Users of passenger \ntransport services will primarily be residents of the project area, and benefits are allocated using \nthe poverty incidence of 91% in the project area. Some freight transport users will be residents \nof Dushanbe, which has a lower poverty incidence. Therefore, an estimated 83% (national \npoverty incidence) of road freight users will be poor. It is assumed that only 5% of vehicle \nowners are poor and benefits to the poor were allocated accordingly. The poverty impact ratio is \nestimated to be 0.71, meaning that 71% of the Project's benefits will accrue to the poor. The \nProject is classified as a poverty intervention based on the proportion of poor among the \nbeneficiaries, the proportion of benefits accruing to the poor, and the positive impact it will have \non other poverty-alleviation projects in the project area. \n \nC.  Social Impact and Stakeholder Participation and Consultations \n \n51.  Key social issues were analyzed during the social analysis conducted as part of the \nproject preparatory TA (footnote 6) and further developed during project processing missions. \nThe Project will have no particular adverse impact on vulnerable groups and no negative \nimplication  for  gender  concerns  or  indigenous  people.  No  resettlement  activities  will  be \nnecessary and there will be no resettlement effects. The project activities will occur within the \nexisting alignment or on land owned by the Government.  \n \n52.  The proposed project design was discussed in detail with local government officials and \nrepresentatives of the affected communities. The project preparatory TA consultants conducted \na detailed survey of 768 households in the project area. The communities are aware of the \nproposed Project and of the implications for their welfare. The Government agreed to ensure \nthat the Project is implemented, to the extent possible, with active participation of the project \nbeneficiaries, using participatory practices, as described in ADB\u2019s handbook, Mainstreaming \nParticipatory Development Processes. \n \n \n \n ", " 17\nD.  Environmental Assessment \n \n53.  The  project  classification  is  environment  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) of the Project was carried out under the project preparatory TA (footnote 6) in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Requirements and Environmental Review \nProcedures,  and  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects.  The  IEE \nindicates that there will be no major adverse environmental impact because the Project involves \nmainly rehabilitation of roads on the existing alignment (except for minor realignments due to \ndifficult geotechnical conditions). The summary IEE is included in Appendix 13. \n \nE.  Road Safety \n \n54.  The Transport Safety Section of MOT\u2019s Transport Policy Department is responsible for \nthe physical aspects of road safety, including road conditions, signs, etc. According to data \ncollected by ADB\u2019s TA for Regional Road Safety Initiatives,17 Tajikistan\u2019s road safety record in \nthe mid-1990s was very poor, with a fatality rate of 407 per 10,000 vehicles. However, recent \ndata from MOT indicate that the situation has improved. Although the number of vehicles has \nincreased substantially, the number of road accidents and fatalities has remained relatively \nstable, with a resulting fatality rate in 2001 of 23 per 10,000 vehicles. The improvement is due to \nimplementation of MOT\u2019s Accident Prevention Plan, under which approximately 30 indicators \nare monitored annually. \n \n55.  The Project includes a number of measures to improve road safety. The rehabilitation \nworks will result in substantial improvement of road safety. Work activities with particular impact \non safety include installation of safety facilities, e.g., barriers, on the mountainous km 95\u2013150 \nsection, improvement of the road surface in areas in which the extensive deterioration results in \nunsafe driving conditions, and the replacement of five deteriorated bridges on the rural roads, \nwhich is also required for traffic safety. The consulting services include one person-month for an \ninternational  road  safety  expert,  whose  tasks  will  include  conducting  a  road  safety  audit, \nadvising MOT on enforcement measures for the road safety action plan, and providing TA for \nincorporating road-safety features in the project design. Domestic consulting services will also \nbe allocated to road safety. \n \nF.  Project Risks \n \n56.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  risks,  which  include  delays  in \nimplementation due to inadequate implementation capacity of the executing agency, failure to \nprovide  counterpart  financing  in  a  timely  manner,  the  traffic  forecast  not  being  realized, \ninadequate road maintenance, and political instability in the project area. The Project includes a \nnumber  of  measures  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  implementation  delays.  The  existing  PIU  will \nimplement the Project and has identified the number and type of additional staff that will be \nhired  to  assist  in  implementation  of  the  proposed  Project.  The  detailed  design  has  been \ncompleted and reflected in the project costs. Advance action has been requested, and the PIU \nis now familiar with ADB procedures and will be able to make full use of the advance action \nprovisions. The Government has been made aware of ADB\u2019s emphasis on the timely provision \nof counterpart funds and has ensured the project processing missions that it can provide the \nnecessary funds for both ADB road rehabilitation projects in a timely manner. In addition, ADB is \nmonitoring the Public Investment Program restrictions agreed to by the Government and the \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1995. Technical Assistance for Regional Initiatives in Road Safety. Manila. ", "18  \n \nInternational Monetary Fund to ensure that the Project does not cause disbursements to exceed \nagreed limits.  \n \n57.  There is some risk that the traffic forecast will not materialize, especially the international \ngenerated traffic arising from increased trade between the PRC and Tajikistan. This risk has \nbeen mitigated by the assumption that full benefits from international generated traffic will not be \nrealized until 2012. There is also a risk that the project roads will not be properly maintained and \nthus the full benefits of the Project will not be realized. The Government is aware of the \nimportance of road maintenance, particularly in the project area, which is mountainous and \nprone to landslides and rockfalls. The project design includes elements to address the risks of \ninadequate  financing  and  implementation  of  road  maintenance  for  the  project  roads.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  loan  assurances  requiring  the  allocation  of  specific  levels  of \nfinancing for maintaining the project roads, in addition to the assurances regarding levels of \nfinancing for road maintenance nationally. The Project also includes procurement of $1 million \nof road maintenance equipment, which will be used solely on the project roads. Part of the \nproject area (from Obigarm to Nurobod) is in an area that was placed under a United Nations \nsecurity restriction following the civil war. However, the security status was upgraded in late \n2002 and is expected to remain in the upgraded condition. A United Nations security escort is \nstill required for foreign personnel traveling past Obigarm. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n58.  The Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard  \nassurances, which are  incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart funding. The Government will provide, on a timely basis, all funds \nand  resources  necessary  for  rehabilitation,  operation  and  maintenance,  and \nmanagement of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road and the rural roads included \nin the Project. The Government will cause MOF to take all necessary measures \nto ensure that MOT can successfully implement the rehabilitation of the project \nroads, and operate and maintain them after completion. \n \n(ii)  Construction quality. MOT will ensure that the project road is rehabilitated in \naccordance with the technical specifications of the design. MOT will also ensure \nthat  construction  supervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are \nperformed in accordance with internationally accepted standards. \n \n(iii)  Maintenance financing. \n \n(a)  The Government will establish a separate budget item within the overall \nbudget for rehabilitation and maintenance of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border \nroad, and will allocate and make available on a timely basis sufficient \nfunds to maintain the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road and the rural roads \nincluded in the Project. The Government will allocate $40,000 per year \n(plus inflation since 2003) to maintain the rehabilitated sections of the \nDushanbe-Kyrgyz border road, following handover of these sections by \nthe  contractor.  The  Government  will  also  ensure  that  the  rural  roads \nrehabilitated under the Project are adequately maintained. \n \n ", " 19\n(b)  The Government will ensure that annual budget allocations and actual \nexpenditures  for  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  (excluding  new \nconstruction) of roads under MOT\u2019s jurisdiction will be increased by no \nless than 15% per year from 2005 to 2007. \n \n(c)  The Government has agreed that actual allocations and expenditures on \nroad maintenance and rehabilitation will account for no less than 80% of \nthe total budget allocations and expenditures for road maintenance and \nrehabilitation  plus  new  construction  (excluding  expenditures  for \nconstruction of the Anzob Tunnel) from 2005 to 2007. \n \n(d)  The  Government  will  annually  adjust  the  amounts  of  budgetary \nallocations indicated in paragraph (b) to compensate for the effect of \nannual inflation.  \n \n(e)  The Government will (i) ensure that details of actual road maintenance \nexpenditures are included in every other quarterly progress report to be \nsubmitted by MOT to ADB, (ii) have such expenditures audited annually \nin  accordance  with  appropriate  auditing  standards  by  independent \nauditors,  and  (iii)  furnish  such  audited  expenditures  to  ADB  within  9 \nmonths from the end of the fiscal year \n \n(iv)  Employment of local labor. The Government will take steps to encourage (a) \nthe use of local labor, including disadvantaged women, in project works; and (b) \nprocurement of local materials. \n \n(v)  Road safety. To ensure a safe road network in the project area, MOT will install \nappropriate  road  safety  facilities  during  project  implementation  and  after \ncompletion, such as pavement markings, warning signs, traffic signs and signals, \ncommunications facilities, hazard barriers, and traffic monitoring facilities. \n \n(vi)  Environment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  road  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance works are carried out in accordance with the environmental laws \nand  regulations  of  Tajikistan  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  procedures  and \nguidelines, in particular, the Environment Policy and Environmental Guidelines \nfor  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects.  The  Government  will  ensure  the \nimplementation of adequate environmental mitigation measures by requiring that \nall contracts related to the rehabilitation of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road and \nthe rural roads contain adequate provisions requiring the contractor to (a) take \nappropriate erosion control measures; (b) minimize any adverse impact due to \naltered embankments, borrow pits, and other activities as set out in the summary \nIEE; (c) take appropriate safety measures to minimize risks of landslides, soil \nsubsidence, and related occurrences; and (d) keep construction materials and \nfacilities, such as asphalt and hot-mix plants, at least 500 meters away from \nschools, hospitals, and other sensitive facilities. The Government will ensure that \n(a)  MOT  and  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Nature  Protection  regularly \nundertake joint inspections of the environmental aspects of the Project, including \nerosion control, and include the results of the inspections in the project quarterly \nreports  submitted  by  MOT  to  ADB;  and  (b)  the  contractors  implement  the \nmitigation measures in accordance with the summary IEE. \n ", "20  \n \n(vii)  Land acquisition. The Borrower will ensure that (a) all rehabilitation works under \nthe Project are undertaken within the existing right-of-way; and (b) any additional \nland, if required under the Project, e.g., for location of contractor maintenance \nbases, is allotted and approved by relevant authorities within the existing right-of-\nway  or  other  unutilized  state-owned  land,  prior  to  the  use  of  such  land  by \ncontractors. \n \n(viii)  Gender  and  development.  MOT  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment  during  implementation  of  the  Project  and  will  take  necessary \nmeasures to encourage women to participate in project implementation activities. \nMOT will monitor effects on women during project implementation through the \nmonitoring and evaluation system, in consultation with local governments and \nlocal women's associations. \n \n(ix)  Health risks. MOT, together with the appropriate authorities, will ensure that \ncontractors disseminate information in the Russian and Tajik languages on the \nrisks  of  socially  transmitted  diseases  to  those  employed  during  project \nimplementation. MOT will also ensure that similar information in the Russian and \nTajik languages is disseminated to transport operators when using the project \nfacilities. \n \n(x)  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  MOT,  with  the  assistance  of  the  international \nconsultants, will monitor and evaluate project impacts to ensure that the project \nfacilities are managed effectively, and that the benefits are maximized. MOT will \ncollect the data agreed with ADB at the commencement of rehabilitation, at \nproject completion, 1 year from project completion, and 3 years after project \ncompletion. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Disbursement \n \n59.  Prior  to  disbursement  of  ADB  loan  proceeds  for  civil  works,  the  OPEC  Fund  loan \nagreement, in a form and content satisfactory to ADB,  will have been duly executed and \ndelivered,  and  have  become  effective,  or  the  Government  will  have  made  alternative \narrangements acceptable to ADB for the financing that was to be provided by the OPEC Fund. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n60.

Subsector Description  \n \n1.  The road subsector is the most important component of domestic transport in Tajikistan. \nThe road network, traffic levels, and the vehicle fleet are discussed in paras. 2 and 3 of the main \ntext. \n \nB.  Road Administration \n \n2.  Prior to Asian Development Bank (ADB) involvement with Tajikistan\u2019s transport sector, \nthe Transport Department under the Office of the President acted as the central point of \ncoordination  for  the  transport  sector.  Development  planning  for  the  subsectors  was  the \nresponsibility of separate government organizations. The Ministry of Transport and Roads \nserved as the national agency for road infrastructure management, managed road transport \nenterprises,  allocated  budgets,  assigned  work,  and  managed  personnel.  Tajik  Railway \nCompany served as the agency for railways, and Tajikistan State Air Company for civil aviation \nand  airports.  Each  organization  was  responsible  for  preparing  development  plans  and \ninvestment programs for its own subsector. During implementation of the development plans, \nthe Office of the President provided coordination for review and revision of the investment \nprograms and for allocation of investment funds among the subsectors.  \n \n3.  As a result of policy dialogue with and technical assistance from ADB, the administration \nof the transport sector was reorganized and Ministry of Transport (MOT) was created. MOT, \nwhich  now  includes  Tajik  Rail  (Tajikistan  Railway)  and  Tajik  Air  (Tajikistan  Airlines),  is \nresponsible for planning and coordinating all modes of transport within the country. The current \norganization  chart  for  MOT  is  shown  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  The  Government  is \ncommitted to develop a transport sector that meets the needs of a market-based economy. The \nreorganized MOT reflects a policy of promoting competition, increasing the private sector's role, \nand enabling customers to make informed decisions. In the future most state-owned enterprises \nwill play a minor role and will be expected to operate as independent commercial enterprises. \nSeparate  deputy  ministers  are  responsible  for  rail  transport  and  air  transport.  These  are \nregulatory and oversight responsibilities only and the line functions remain with Tajik Rail and \nTajik Air, respectively. MOT\u2019s Roads Department is responsible for administration, maintenance, \nand construction of roads in Tajikistan, and has a number of associated entities. For example, \nTajikgiprotransstroy (the Design Institute, a joint stock company), is responsible for surveys, \ntesting of materials, design of maintenance, and new construction in the subsector. \n \nC.  Road Standards and Safety \n \n4.  Tajikistan\u2019s road standards and specifications are based on those of the former Soviet \nUnion (FSU). Several studies have indicated that the design standards of FSU state roads \n(national roads in Tajikistan) are sometimes higher than those of the United States or European \ncountries but do not always result in optimum road design. For lower-standard roads, FSU \nstandards  for  design  speed  and  cross  sections  are  similar  to  those  used  in developing \ncountries, but for higher-category roads, they are excessive. The quality of construction of \nTajikistan\u2019s  roads  is  generally  inadequate,  mainly  because  of  a  lack  of  cost-effective \nconstruction techniques and independent construction supervision. Road safety is discussed in \nparas. 54\u201355 of the main text. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nD.  Road Transport Industry \n \n5.  Major  changes  have  occurred  in  the  road  transport  industry  since  independence, \nespecially in the commercialization, and in some cases privatization, of the industry.  In 1998, \nthe Government had jurisdiction over 81 road transport service enterprises. Most intercity bus \nand trucking operations are now organized as joint stock companies, with various shares of \npublic and private ownership. For example, of the 52 medium and large transport organizations \nformerly part of MOT and designated by the Government for privatization, 73% are wholly-\nowned by the Government, 6% are wholly privately-owned, and 21% have mixed public-private \nownership. As of March 2002, 5,226 vehicles were operated by joint stock companies and other \norganizations within MOT. Of these, 3,627 vehicles or 69% were operated by four joint stock \ncompanies  (Badakshonnakliyot,  Khatlontrans,  Khudjandnaklyot,  and  Kulyabtrans).  The \nremaining vehicles were operated  by other MOT departments, Tajik Air, and Tajik Rail. A \nsignificant portion of trucking and most long-distance bus services are operated by private \ncompanies.  Tariffs  for  road  freight  have  been  completely  deregulated;  road  haulage \norganizations enter into agreements with customers at negotiated rates. Tariffs for passenger \ntransport are still regulated. MOT and the Ministry of Economy jointly establish tariffs for \npassenger transport for buses, minibuses, and taxis for urban and long-distance services. While \nthese official tariffs should be charged by all operators, many bus and minibus operators charge \nmarket fares, according to what they think people will pay, and do not follow the official tariff. \n \nE.  Road Subsector Revenue and Expenditure \n \n6.  The state budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance varies from year to \nyear  according  to  the  Government's  priorities  and  fiscal  constraints.  Prior  to  2000,  road \nsubsector expenditures were financed from the Road Fund, the state budget, and development \nagencies. The Road Fund had four main sources: (i) road-user taxes, such as excise taxes on \npurchases  of  vehicles  and  parts,  tires,  fuel,  and  lubricants,  but  including  a  2.5%  tax  on \ntransactions  by  all  companies;  (ii)  charges  on  international  transit  shipments;  (iii)  vehicle \ninspection fees and registration fees; and (iv) contributions from local governments. In practice, \nonly half of the Road Fund collection was allocated to road rehabilitation and maintenance; the \nother half was used to fund new construction.  As a result of general fiscal constraints and \nallocations to new construction, expenditures on road maintenance and rehabilitation have been \nmuch lower than what was needed to maintain the road network at an acceptable level. Details \non the current status of road subsector financing are discussed in para. 6 of the main text. \n \nF.  Road Maintenance \n \n7.  Maintenance of the road network throughout Tajikistan virtually ceased following the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union. Maintenance funding was also unavailable during the civil war \nwhen numerous bridges and road sections were damaged. Heavily loaded trucks and army \ntanks reportedly used the roads during this period and undoubtedly contributed to the structural \ndamage of the pavement. Funding for road maintenance has decreased by almost 99% since \nindependence, and this inadequate funding is reflected in the deteriorated condition of the road \nnetwork. Allocation of funding is often restricted to emergency maintenance needs and is \ninsufficient  for  routine  or  periodic  maintenance  requirements.  Little,  if  any,  preventative \nmaintenance activities are currently being undertaken outside of Dushanbe as part of a detailed, \nplanned, and scheduled road maintenance program. Following the breakup of the state and \ncollective farms, responsibility for maintenance of the rural and farm roads formerly under their \njurisdiction now rests with the local district administrations.  \n \n \n ", "26   Appendix 2 \n8.  MOT is responsible for the planning and coordination of the maintenance of Tajikistan's \nroad network. MOT maintains roads and bridges, through five maintenance divisions that are \nresponsible for the maintenance activities in their regions. These maintenance divisions include \nBadahshonroh,  Dushanbe  Road  Management  (DRM),  Khatlonroh,  Khudjandroh,  and \nTajikdorstroitrest. These five divisions are responsible for the maintenance of approximately \n14,000 km of road, and employed 3,291 people in 2001. These road maintenance divisions are \nstate  entities,  attached  to  MOT.  None  of  the  road  maintenance  units  (RMUs)  has  been \nprivatized. While it is the stated intention of MOT to eventually privatize this function, no \nprogress has been made to date. The road maintenance divisions prepare annual maintenance \nplans and budgets based on systems established during the Soviet era. This information is then \npresented to MOT, which in turn allocates funding to the various divisions. DRM is responsible \nfor maintenance in the Region of Republican Subordination (RRS) and, in particular for the \nproject road from Dushanbe to Nurobod, formerly Darband. The RRS is made up of 15 RMUs, \nwhich are located throughout the RRS. These RMUs are responsible for the road network within \ntheir jurisdiction with actual maintenance being carried out by staff who are responsible for \nmaintenance of specific sections of road. DRM has 760 people who are engaged in annual \nmaintenance activities within the project area with an annual budget of TJS517,000. However, \nthe plant, equipment, and materials available to the workforce are not sufficient for carrying out \neffective maintenance activities. \n \nG.  Policy Dialogue for the Transport Sector \n \n9.  Market-oriented  reforms  for  the  transport  sector  are  now  being  introduced  through \nimplementation of the ADB-financed Road Rehabilitation Project,1 the completed Postconflict \nInfrastructure Program,2 and several related advisory technical assistance activities.3 The status \nand achievements to date of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue are summarized in the Transport Sector \nPolicy Reform Plan, Table A2. \n \nTable A2: Transport Sector Policy Reform Plan \n  Status Prior to Policy     \nInitiative  Dialogue with ADB  Actions for Transport Sector  Implementation Date \n1.

", "28   Appendix 2 \n10.  As shown in the Transport Sector Policy Reform Plan, ADB\u2019s extensive policy dialogue \nfor the transport sector has covered all subsectors and numerous issues. The ongoing Loan \n1819-TAJ (footnote 1) includes a number of covenants that were originally part of Loan 1651-\nTAJ (footnote  2). While the Government has complied with a number of these covenants, \nparticularly those related to implementation of the Transport Law, it has not complied with four \ncovenants, relating primarily to corporatization of the railway and aviation subsectors. The \nGovernment, in a letter of 6 October 2003, formally requested an extension of the dates of \ncompliance for two outstanding covenants and waivers of two other outstanding covenants. The \nGovernment\u2019s achievements regarding each of these covenants, actions being undertaken in \ncoordination with other development partners, and actions the Government has requested from \nADB are described as follows. ADB has approved the Government's requests concerning the \ncovenants. \n \n(i)  Develop time-bound action plans, acceptable to ADB for corporatization \nand  further  commercialization  of  Tajik  Airlines  and  Tajik  Airports.  The \nGovernment issued Decree 666 in June 2002 regarding corporatization and \ncommercialization of civil aviation (and Tajik Rail). The Government also has an \nongoing  project  and  policy  dialogue  in  the  civil  aviation  subsector  with  the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Based on the progress \nmade to date in reforming the aviation subsector and the ongoing program with \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  Government  has \nrequested that ADB waive this covenant. \n \n(ii)  Define the roles and responsibilities of the shareholders and Board of \nDirectors  of  the  corporatized  Tajik  Rail. The  Government  plans  to  begin \nimplementing this covenant in 2004 (in accordance with Decree 82 of March \n2002). The Government has requested extension of the compliance date for this \nloan covenant from May 2003 to 31 December 2005.  \n \n(iii)  Develop  corporate  plan  for  Tajik  Rail.  The  Government  plans  to  begin \nimplementing this covenant in 2004 (also in accordance with Decree 82 of March \n2002). The Government has requested extension of the compliance date for this \nloan covenant from June 2003 to 31 December 2005.  \n \n(iv)  Prepare annual reports, available to the public and audited by independent \nauditors in accordance with  international accounting standards (IAS), for \nTajik Rail. The Government issued Decree 428 in November  2002 regarding \nimplementation  of  IAS  and  also  has  an  ongoing  project  with  United States \nAgency for International Development (USAID) to help implement IAS (including \na pilot project with Tajik Rail). The Government has therefore requested that ADB \nwaive this covenant. \n \n11.  In addition, the Government has requested modification of another covenant from Loan \n1819-TAJ,  regarding  road  maintenance  financing  as  a  proportion  of  road  subsector \nexpenditures to make it consistent with the related covenant in the proposed Project. \n ", "Appendix 3  29\nSUMMARY OF POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n1.  An initial poverty and social analysis was undertaken during technical assistance (TA) \nfact-finding, identifying key poverty and social issues to be analyzed during project preparation. \nBased on the findings during project preparation, a poverty and social analysis (Table A3.1) was \ncarried out to ensure that the Project meets the safeguard policy requirements of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The results are summarized in Table A3.1. \n \nTable A3.1:  Summary of Poverty and Social Analysis \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty    Sector identified as a national priority in country \nanalysis?   Yes  poverty partnership agreement?   Yes \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Tajikistan. The road subsector contributes to poverty \nreduction directly through improved access and reduced costs for transport of agricultural products to markets, \nemployment opportunities, and social services; and indirectly through stimulating economic development.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis          Proposed Classification:  Poverty Intervention \nThe poverty incidence in the primary project area is estimated at 91%. Approximately 127,000 poor people will be \ndirectly affected by the Project (91% of 140,000 residents). The majority of residents are below the poverty line, \nbased on various measures (e.g., employment, income, nutrition, access to medical care, motor vehicle ownership). \nThis Project will directly benefit and provide new economic opportunities for the poor in the project area. The poverty \nintervention classification is justified as this Project upgrades transportation along a main valley that depends heavily \nupon good access to the capital, Dushanbe. The majority of traffic and benefits will go to the people in the valley or \ntransport companies who service the areas. Approximately 44,000 person-months (3,667 person-years) of unskilled \nlabor will be required for construction. Local residents are expected to fill most of this requirement. Total additional \nincome for this unskilled labor component is estimated to be $1.32 million. Economic benefits are expected to accrue \nprimarily from reduced transportation costs and time saving, new employment opportunities, and improved access to \nagricultural markets. The poverty impact ratio (PIR) has been estimated at 0.71.  \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis prepared:   Yes \nA detailed survey covering 768 households was conducted under the project preparation technical assistance (TA). \nSocioeconomic surveys indicate strong support for the Project. Strong support for new employment opportunities was \nindicated. \n \nParticipation strategy: Construction contracts will include provisions for maximizing use of local labor. An associated \nadvisory TA will evaluate a labor-based rural road maintenance program. Monitoring of social and economic progress \nis included in project supervision services. \nD.

In the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of 2002, the Government of Tajikistan identified \nroads and road transport  as the key transport facilities for cargo shipments and passenger \ntransportation, in view of the country\u2019s geographic location and mountainous conditions. The \nGovernment has placed development, rehabilitation, and reform (including privatization) of \ntransport within  the agenda on poverty reduction. This is in line with one of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, i.e., to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, as well as the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction goals in its poverty partnership agreement of 2002. The Project will contribute \nsignificantly to this goal (paras. 10\u201314). \n  \nA.  The Project Area \n \n1.  Description of the Project Impact Area \n \n3.  The primary impact area is largely agricultural. However, there is very little arable land \nper capita in this part of Tajikistan. The median per capita holding of cropland in the primary \nimpact area is only 2/100th of a hectare \u2014 only one third the amount of land per person in poor \nareas of eastern and central People's Republic of China,1 for example. Much of the agricultural \nland is in hillside fields of marginal land with slopes of up to 60% and subject to significant \nerosion. The farther from Dushanbe, the higher the elevation, and the lower the quality of the \nland. Much of the land has been used for subsistence crops since the outbreak of the civil war in \nthe 1990s, rather than for cash crops or raising animals. Principal household crops are wheat, \npotatoes, apples, carrots, onions, and grapes. Livestock is also raised. Much of the best land in \nthe two Vahdat (Kofarnikhon) jamoats is used to grow cotton; however, much of the income \ngoes to taxes. Generally, for grain in this area, the higher the elevation and the steeper the \nslopes, the lower the quality of the soil and yield per hectare. It would take (on average) 2.35 of \nthe land area in Faisabod to produce as much grain as is produced in Vahdat, and 3.33 times \nthe area to grow that same amount in Rogun. \n \n2.  Employment in the Project Area \n \n4.  Unemployment and underemployment are widespread in the primary impact area. Eight \nof 13 jamoat heads surveyed said that most of the male working age population in their jamoat \nhad no job at all. Two others said that about 50% had no job. Lack of processing capability and \nlack of ready markets feed the continuation of low value subsistence agriculture, thus limiting \nemployment opportunities. All three primary impact districts produce apples, some of which are \nhigh-value varieties. However, there are no facilities for export to international markets, and no \nfacilities for processing the apples into higher value foods. Similarly, the uplands of the three \ndistricts appear to be ideal countryside for dairy farming (the highland areas may be more suited \nto sheep and goats) for processing and sale of products into regional markets. The civil war \ndestroyed  most  of  the  livestock,  which  in  general  has  not  been  replaced  yet.  Electricity; \ncommunications;  investment  capital  (for  both  plants  and  livestock);  and  cost  effective, \nappropriate,  and  reliable  transport  are  needed  for  development  in  this  area.  Households \ncontinue to raise wheat to make bread in the mountainous areas where yields are low. Ideally, \nthis part of Tajikistan should be raising more high-value, labor-intensive crops for market (and \nprocessing) while importing wheat produced more efficiently elsewhere.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  See feasibility studies conducted for ADB for the Hefie-Xi'an, and Ganzhou-Longyan railway projects. \n ", "Appendix 3  31\n3.  Poverty in the Project Area \n \n5.  Based  upon  national  and  regional  data,  discussions  with  local  officials,  household \nsurveys, and visits to villages and schools, it is estimated that 91% of the people in the primary \nimpact area of the Project are living in poverty. Two indicators of poverty for this Project were \nselected, i.e., protein per person per day and days per week meat is eaten. Table A3.2 shows \nthe percent that are below the 60-gram per person per day standard for protein intake and the \npercent below 90% of that standard. 2 \n \nTable A3.2:  Protein Consumption in the Project Area \n  Percent Below Standard   \nProtein Standard  Vahdat      Primary \n(per day)  (2 jamoats)  Faisabod  Rogun  Impact Area \n60 grams standard  93    95    95  95 \n54 grams (90% of 60 gram)  88    91    93  91 \nNote: Based on survey of 765 households. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants. \n \n6.  The project preparatory TA consultants surveyed what proportion of the population eats \nmeat and for how many days per week (Table A3.3). The \"meat days\" method is simpler, less \nprecise, and less sophisticated than the \"protein per person\" method. Those who eat meat 3 \ndays per week or less are considered poor, while those who eat meat 4 days per week or more \nare not poor. This yields a poverty rate of 82% in the Vahdat jamoats, 85% in Faisabod, and \n93% in Rogun, for an overall rate of 86% for the primary impact area using this indicator. Using \nthe results of the household survey and adopting the 90% of the 60 grams of protein per person \nper day standard, absolute poverty is projected to afflict 91% of the population of the primary \nimpact area, 88% of the two Vahdat jamoats, 91% of Faisabod, and 93% of Rogun. \n \nTable A3.3:  Days of Meat Consumption Per Person Per Week \n  Vahdat       \nPercent of Population  (2 Jamoats)  Faisabod  Rogun  Total \n          (%)      (%)       (%)         (%) \nMeat 7 Days per Week  18.2  13.4  6.8  13.5 \nMeat 4 to 6 Days per Week  0.0  1.8  0.0  0.9 \nMeat 1 to 3 Days per Week  0.0  10.6  25.0  10.4 \nNo Meat  81.8  74.2  68.2  75.2 \nTotal  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0 \nNote: Based on survey of 6,635 households. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants. \n \n7.  The project  preparatory TA consultants also surveyed subjective perceptions of \npeople in the primary impact area. In the survey, people were asked to place themselves \nand their household on a nine-step ladder, where the first step is extreme poverty and the \nhighest (ninth) step is wealth. Fewer than 9% see themselves as at the midpoint or above it; \n15% see themselves as in extreme poverty; 65% as just above extreme poverty; and 10% \nas below the midpoint. Together, that is 90% of the population.  \n \n                                                 \n2  The United Nations' Human Development Index for Tajikistan is significantly distorted by the relatively high \neducational levels of the population and is not used. \n ", "32 Appendix 3 \n4.  Gender Issues \n \n8.  Well-defined, traditional gender roles embedded in Tajik culture are in place in the \nprimary impact area and largely observed by both men and women. These roles prescribe, \namong other practices, dress and the division of labor within households. This traditional culture \nexists within the context of 70 years of Soviet official insistence upon equal opportunity for \nwomen. Neither observation, discussion with school heads, nor the survey data indicated \ndiscrimination against girls at school or inequality of educational  opportunity.  A  number  of \nwomen  hold  high  positions  in  local  government.  Women  have,  however, been adversely \naffected by the lack of personal security, economic impoverishment, and declining participation, \nas a result of both war and economic transition. Due to the civil war, the number of families \nheaded  by  single  women  has  increased.  The  economic  transition  has  severely  affected \nindustries that  employ a high proportion of women (textiles, manufacturing, and agriculture), \ncausing them to be among the first to lose their jobs. Other sectors where women predominate, \nsuch as health and education, are those where wages are least likely to have been paid. The \ncollapse of the state social safety net has exacerbated the number of women and families living \nin  poverty,  while  the  loss  of  quotas  guaranteeing  equal  representation  in  political  and \ngovernmental bodies has increasingly kept them out of decision-making positions.  \n \n5.  Affordability and Absorptive Capacity \n \n9.  No toll will be charged for use of the project roads. The reduced VOCs are expected to \nbe passed on to users of transport services due to competitive market conditions. The poor will \nbenefit from savings in the transport costs. \n \nB.  Social and Poverty Impact-Related Project Features \n \n10.  The Project has been designed to maximize the poverty reduction impact.  The rural \nroads included in the Project were selected based on the following criteria: (i) geographic \nlocation,  (ii)  poverty  and  social  considerations,  (iii)  economic  and  traffic  criteria,  (iv) \nsustainability, and (v) cooperation. Discussions were held with the Ministry of Transport (MOT), \nlocal government officials, and residents of rural villages. The criteria for geographic location \nwere incorporated through examination of topographic maps of the area and discussions with \nproject engineers. Poverty and social considerations were included using results of the social \nsurveys. Economic and traffic criteria were based on economic information on the villages, \ninterviews in the field, and traffic count data. Cooperation links the current Project with other \nprojects focused on agriculture and other industries to further develop within the project area. \n \nTable A3.4: Village Groups and Lengths of Rural Roads \nDistrict  Kilometer of Rural Roads \nRogun   \n  Katiob jamoat  25.1 \nFaisabod   \n  Faisabod jamoat  24.0 \n  Zulfi  9.3 \n  Pionerabod  3.1 \n  Karsang  3.7 \n  Ilok  2.5 \nVahdat   \n  Zulfi  9.3 \n    Total  77.0 \nSource: Technical assistance consultants. \n ", "Appendix 3  33\n11.  The groups of villages served by the rural road networks were identified by local officials \nas the poorest areas of their districts and jamoats. This judgment was confirmed by the data \ndeveloped during the TA, including the household and village surveys. The Katiob grouping is \nthe highest priority as it is the poorest. These roads serve villages on a high mountainside, with \nrelatively poor land, family landholdings inadequate for subsistence, a short growing season and \nsignificant isolation. The poor quality of local roads exacerbates the already significant isolation \nof these villages. The Zulfi grouping is ranked second and comprises villages in the Faisabod \nand Vahdat districts. This is also a mountain area with less productive land, widespread poverty, \nand greater isolation from markets and health and other social services, made worse by the \ndeteriorated conditions of the road network. The Faisabod grouping is ranked third. It is a \ndensely populated area on the other side of the river valley from the project highway. It is \ncurrently cut off from the main highway and the district center by a missing section of the main \nbridge. While these villages are at low elevations, the valley is not wide and much of the \navailable land has considerable slope. The remaining three groups are much smaller and \naddress the needs of other impoverished villages. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Assessment \n \n1.  Distribution of Project Benefits \n \n12.  The economic analysis quantified five categories of project benefits: (i) VOC savings for \nnormal traffic, (ii) international generated traffic, (iii) local generated traffic, (iv) poverty reduction \nbenefits, and (v) time savings. The project benefits have been distributed among the following \ngroups: (i) users of freight transport, (ii) users of passenger transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) \nlabor, (v) the Government, and (vi) the economy of Tajikistan (Appendix 12). For VOCs, 80% of \nthe savings are attributable to trucks and 20% to buses and cars. As the trucking industry in \nTajikistan is in the private sector, and competition is strong on the project road, most of the \nreduction in VOCs are likely to be passed on to users in terms of lower transport charges. It is \nassumed that 10% of VOC savings for trucks will go to owners of vehicles and labor; with the \nremaining 90% to users. The same percentage distribution is assumed for VOC savings to \npassenger vehicles. These allocations of benefits have been applied to benefits from normal \nand local generated traffic. Benefits from international generated traffic result from increases in \ntrade and have been allocated to the economy. Poverty benefits represent real increases in \nincomes of poor people in the vicinity of project road, and have been attributed to the economy. \n \n2.  Calculation of Poverty Impact Ratio \n \n13.  The distribution of benefits to the poor and poverty impact ratio are shown in Table A3.5. \nThe Project will have direct poverty reduction impact through (i) increased prices received by \nhouseholds  and  private  farms  of  poor  villages  for  their  agricultural  products;  (ii)  reduced \ntransport costs for shipping agricultural products to Dushanbe; (iii) reduced bus fares for poor \npeople traveling on the project road; and (iv) reduced transport costs on the rural roads, which \nreduce the prices for inputs (e.g., seeds, fertilizers, consumable, etc.) purchased in rural villages. \nBenefits to freight and passenger transport users have been allocated to the poor on the basis \nof the transport user population that is poor. Users of passenger transport services will primarily \nbe residents of the project area and benefits are allocated to using the poverty incidence of 91% \nin the project area. Some freight transport users will be residents of Dushanbe, which has a \nlower poverty incidence. Therefore, an estimated  83% (national poverty incidence) of road \nfreight users are poor. The benefits to freight transport users are distributed to the poor on the \nbasis of 75%. It is assumed that only 5% of vehicle owners are poor and benefits to the poor \nwere allocated accordingly. Bus fares are not regulated and there is free competition among \n ", "34 Appendix 3 \noperators. Therefore, it is assumed that savings in VOCs of buses will be passed on to transport \nusers. Based on 2010 VOCs for buses, the savings for a trip between Dushanbe and Rogun will \nbe 7.8%, and between Dushanbe and Faisabod, 4.0% following project completion. Local \nofficials estimated that 500 passengers per day travel between Rogun and Dushanbe and 1,200 \npassengers between Faisabod and Dushanbe. Typical bus fares from Rogun are TJS2.5 (about \n$0.80) per trip and from Faisabod, TJS1.5 (about $0.50). This results in annual savings for poor \npeople traveling by bus to Dushanbe of about $24,500 for passengers from Rogun and about \n$18,000 for passengers from Faisabod.  \n \nTable A3.5: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio \n($ million in present value at 12% discount rate) \n                  Net \nFinancial  Economic  Economic-  Passenger  Freight  Vehicle  National \nItem  PV  PV  Financial  Users  Users  Owners  Labor  Economy  Benefits \nBenefits                   \nVOC Savings      11.72    11.72    2.12    8.66    0.94          11.72 \nInt'l Generated                   \n   Traffic    8.26    8.26        8.26    8.26 \nGen Domestic                   \n  Traffic    0.66    0.66    0.12    0.48    0.07    0.66 \nPoverty      1.51    1.51            1.51    1.51 \nTime Savings      0.13    0.13    0.13            0.13 \nCosts                   \nInvestment and                    \n  maintenance  (16.73)    (15.20)    1.53    1.53    1.53 \nLabor  (0.94)    (0.71)    0.24         0.24      0.24 \nNet Present                   \n  Value  (17.67)    6.39    24.06    2.37    9.14    1.00   0.24    11.30    24.06 \n                   \n  Gains and Losses    2.37    9.14    1.00  0.24    (6.37)    6.39 \n  Proportion of the Poor    0.91    0.75    0.10   0.83    0.75     \n  Net Benefits for the Poor    2.16    6.86    0.10   0.20    (4.78)    4.54 \n  Poverty Impact Ratio    0.71 \nPV = present value; VOC = vehicle operating costs.   \nSource: Technical assistance consultants. \n \n14.  Benefits to labor were attributed to poor people on the basis of the estimated number of \npoor that would be involved in construction of the project road. Based on an evaluation of the \nconstruction costs for the project road, as well as similar evaluations in Asia,  approximately \n4,400  person-months  of  unskilled  labor  will  be  needed  for  the  Project. The Project will \nencourage unskilled labor jobs by poor people in the vicinity of the work. This amounts to 83% \nof total benefit attributable to labor.  Benefits attributed to the economy are primarily from \ngenerated  traffic,  which  is  assumed  to  be  international  flows  between  Tajikistan  and  the \nPeople's Republic of China. This would likely benefit the poor people in villages along the road, \nas well as residents of Dushanbe. The poverty reduction benefits are based on higher prices \nreceived for agricultural products produced in the project area. For many producers, the road \nimprovements will enable them to take their produce to Dushanbe for sale at higher prices \ncompared with local markets close to the villages. Based on discussions with villagers and \nparticipants at local markets along the road, producers can receive 50\u2013100% more for their \ngoods if sold in markets in Dushanbe, instead of local markets. This price differential would \nlikely be higher the greater the distance from Dushanbe. To compute benefits in a conservative \nmanner, an increase in selling price was estimated to be 60% for produce in the Faisabod area; \n70% from Rogun and 50% from Vahdat. As a result of the calculation in Table A3.5, the poverty \nimpact ratio has been calculated to be 0.71, meaning that 71% of the benefits will accrue to the \npoor. \n ", "Appendix 3  35\n3.  Resettlement Effects of the Project \n \n15.  Discussion with MOT officials, an inventory of road status, visits to sites of adjustments \nin the alignment, and review of maps and engineering drawings indicate that no resettlement is \nexpected in the implementation of this Project. All project activities will take place within the \nexisting alignment or on land owned by the Government. No impact on existing cropland or \nother productive land, or housing or other structures is planned. All land used will be within the \nexisting right-of-way. No farmland, other productive land, housing, shops, or other structures will \nbe affected. While decisions as to the location of construction maintenance bases will be made \nby contractors, contractors will be likely to rent or lease existing MOT maintenance facilities and \nexisting \"machine tractor stations\" of collective farms (and former collective farms) that are near \nthe road. In either case, no temporary taking of productive land or structures is anticipated. Thus \nno  resettlement  (as  defined  in  ADB's  Handbook  on  Resettlement)  is  necessary  for  the \nimplementation of the Project, and no adverse effects to people, buildings, and productive lands \nare anticipated. \n \n4.  Effects of the Project on Ethnic Minorities \n \n16.  The people living in the area are almost entirely ethnic Tajiks. Kyrgyz people live near \nthe border with Kyrgyzstan, far beyond Nurobod (Darband) and the project area. All of the \nfamilies of ethnic groups within the project area who may have lived in traditional ways for \ncenturies were collectivized and integrated into the economic and social structure of the Soviet \nUnion during the 1920s and 1930s, in line with the Soviet goals of that era to industrialize rural \nproduction and rural ways of life. Ethnic minorities are less than 5% of the population of the \nprimary impact area and are clustered in three places: Turks in Jamoat Vahdat, Uzbeks in \nJamoat Yangibozor (Vahdat District), and Russians in Rogun City. No adverse impacts or \nsignificant changes to their livelihoods or culture are anticipated. \n \n5.  Poverty Impact of the Road Improvements \n \n17.  The Project will have a substantial poverty impact which is discussed in detail in paras. \n20\u201322 of the main text. \n \nD.  Poverty Impact Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n18.  Monitoring and evaluating the poverty impact of the Project is discussed in para. 39 of \nthe main text. A draft project performance management system is included in Appendix 9. It is \nrecommended that portions of the household survey are repeated with the same households \nannually during construction and after road rehabilitation is completed. This will enable changes \nin the social and economic situation of these households to be analyzed to understand what \nkinds of benefits are attributed to the improvements in road transport result. \n ", "36 Appendix 4 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR \n \n  Loan/TA/    Loan/TA   \n  Project    Amount  Date \n  Number  Project Name  ($million)  Approved \nA.

Existing Traffic \n \n1.  Seasonally adjusted base year (2002) traffic counts were conducted by the consultants \nduring the project preparatory technical assistance1 for the Project and used in the traffic \nforecast analysis and economic assessments for each section of the project road (Dushanbe-\nNurobod). Existing data on historical traffic counts by the Ministry of Transport on major road \nsections were also reviewed to determine appropriate base-year traffic. \n \n2.  The dissolution of the former Soviet  Union and the outbreak of civil war caused a \ndramatic reduction in traffic on the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road. Traffic levels on the four \nproject sections (excluding rural roads) are on average about 80% lower than in 1990. Since \n1995, however, traffic levels have been slowly increasing. Average annual growth rates on the \nfour  road  sections  during  1995\u20132002  are,  on  average,  3.3%.  Average  traffic  volumes  (in \nvehicles per day) on the project road sections are 4,623 vehicles per day on the Dushanbe-\nVahdat section, 665 on the Vahdat-Faisabod section, 526 on the Faisabod-Obigarm section, \nand 399 on the Obigarm-Nurobod section. Trucks comprise the largest portion of traffic (51%\u2013\n56%) traffic on the project road, except for the Dushanbe-Vahdat section with 33%. Cars are the \nsecond most important, comprising 36%\u201344%, with the exception of the Dushanbe-Vahdat \nsection, with 64%, due to the higher income levels in Dushanbe. \n \nB.  Traffic Forecast \n \n3.  Traffic forecasts by vehicle type were prepared for the project road sections for 2003\u2013\n2027. The forecasts are based on expected growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and \npopulation and on income elasticities of demand for freight and passenger vehicles. Population \nis expected to increase at an average annual growth rate of 1.6% per year during the remainder \nof the project period. GDP is estimated to grow at annual rates of 5% through 2012 and 4% \nthereafter, in line with the World Bank\u2019s recent economic evaluation of Tajikistan.2 Income \nelasticities of demand used for 2003\u20132005 are 1.6 for passengers and 1.5 for freight vehicles, \nwhile elasticities of 1.3 and 1.1 are applied to passenger vehicles and freight, respectively, for \nthe remainder of the project period. \n \n4.  Based on forecast GDP growth, population growth, and income elasticities of demand \nover the total project period, average annual traffic growth rates for trucks, buses, and cars are \nestimated at 6.5%, 4.6% and 6.3% during 2003\u20132012, and 4.0%, 3.5%, and 4.7% during the \nremainder of the project period. Volumes of traffic forecast on the project road sections are \nsummarized in Table A11. Normal traffic is expected to account for 25%\u201335% of total traffic on \nthe project road in 2027, except for the Dushanbe-Vahdat section, on which it comprises 77% of \nthe traffic.

The traffic forecast by vehicle type is in Supplementary Appendix D. Trucks comprise the \nmajority of traffic on the project road, accounting for about 55% of traffic in 2027, with the \nexception of the Dushanbe-Vahdat section, on which trucks account for 36%. Cars account for \nabout 43% of traffic in 2027, except on the Dushanbe-Vahdat section, on which they account for \n62%, due to the higher levels of income and car ownership in Dushanbe compared to the rest of \nthe project area. Buses comprise less than 5% of forecast traffic on the project road in 2027. \nThe composition of traffic by vehicle type is expected to change slightly during the forecast \nperiod,  with  the  share  accounted  for  by  buses  decreasing  by  less  than  5%.  The  share \naccounted for by trucks changes by 3% or less on the four sections of the main road during the \nforecast period. The share account for by cars changes by 2% or less during the forecast \nperiod, except for the Vahdat-Faisabod section, on which it increases by 5%. \n \n6.  At present, about 50% of Tajikistan\u2019s imports from the People's Republic of China (PRC) \nconsist  of  fabric,  chemicals,  and  cotton  and  tea;  while  cotton  comprises  about  70%  of \nTajikistan\u2019s exports to the PRC. The economic implications are significant in terms of potential \ntrade volumes with the PRC through ground linkage with improved road conditions. In particular, \nthe PRC is expected to provide a large market for Tajikistan\u2019s agricultural output and to become \na large source of consumer goods for Tajikistan. The Project is expected to establish a basic \nfoundation toward facilitating cross-border traffic between Tajikistan and the PRC. At present, \nthe need to transship goods at borders is a costly and time-consuming operation for all. Goods \ntransported into the PRC must use Chinese vehicles. The assumption of free vehicle movement \nacross international borders without the need for transshipment has been incorporated into \nestimating internationally generated traffic forecast. It is further estimated that the rehabilitation \nof the entire road section between Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border-PRC will be complete not earlier \nthan 2012. The projected Tajikistan-PRC traffic is forecast to build up over a period of 3 years \nbeginning in 2009. This PRC traffic is expected to grow at the same rate as the other traffic on \nthe project road after 2012. \n ", "52 Appendix 12 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  General \n \n1.  The economic analysis was carried out for each section of the project road, including \nrural  roads,  by  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  In  the  without-project \nscenario,  the  road  is  assumed  to  receive  only  minimal  maintenance  and  to  continue  to \ndeteriorate. The with-project scenario includes routine and periodic maintenance according to \ninternational  standards.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  considered  various \nmutually exclusive project alternatives, and the proposed Project is based on the most cost \neffective and least cost option. The economic analysis covers 24 years (2004\u20132027), based on \na  4-year  implementation  period.  All  benefits  and  costs  are  in  constant  2003  prices.  The \neconomic prices are expressed using the world price numeraire. \n \nB.  Costs \n \n2.  Project  economic  costs  include  the  resource  costs  of  road  improvement  and \nmaintenance (including rural roads), equipment, and consulting services. Price contingencies, \ninterest  during  construction,  and  taxes  and  duties  are  excluded.  Costs  were  divided  into \ntradable and non-tradable portions. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to the non-\ntradable portion. To take into account local unemployment and underemployment, costs for \nunskilled labor were adjusted by a shadow wage rate factor of 0.75 to arrive at the economic \nopportunity cost. \n \nC.  Benefits \n \n3.  The primary economic benefits for the Project are vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings \nfor  normal  traffic,  domestic  and  international  generated  traffic,  time savings, and poverty \nalleviation benefits. Economic benefits were calculated using the same methodology used for \ncosts. VOC savings will accrue primarily from improvements in the road surface, horizontal and \nvertical alignment, and increased average speed on some sections. Unit economic VOCs for six \ntypes of vehicles were estimated using the highway design and maintenance standards model, \nand are shown in Table A12.1. VOC savings for normal traffic account for about 53% of total \nbenefits. Benefits for generated traffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal \ntraffic. \n \nTable A12.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type \n($ per '000 vehicle-km) \n \n Item  Without Project  With Project  VOC Savings \n2 Axle Truck  121.9  114.1  7.8 \n3 Axle Truck  159.5  147.7  11.8 \n>3 Axle Truck  312.4  289.2  23.2 \nSmall Bus  62.6  62.4  0.2 \nLarge Bus  151.5  150.2  1.3 \nCar  133.6  132.1  1.5 \nkm = kilometer, VOC = vehicle operating costs.   \nNote: VOCs are for Dushanbe-Vahdat (Kofarnikhon) road section in 2007. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants. \n \n ", "Appendix 12  53\n4.  Domestic  generated  traffic  is  defined  as  new  traffic  induced  from  the  reduction  in \ntransport  costs  arising  from  the  Project.  International  generated  traffic  comprises  new \ninternational traffic arising from increased trade between Tajikistan and the People's Republic of \nChina resulting from improvement of the project road. The improved road conditions will also \nresult in time savings. The value of time for bus passengers is calculated at $0.062 per hour. \nCar passengers are assumed to have a 50% higher average value of time. Poverty alleviation \nbenefits arise from the higher prices which farmers will be able to obtain for their produce \nthrough improved access to markets. Poverty alleviation benefits are discussed in detail in \nAppendix 3. The Project will also have other benefits, such as improved access to social \nservices, which cannot be quantified. \n \nD.  Results of Economic Analysis \n \n5.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the four main national \nroad sections, the rural roads component, and for the overall Project (Table A12.2). The EIRR \nfor the overall Project is 15.8%, and the net present value is $6.4 million, using a 12% discount \nrate. The EIRRs for the four main road sections and rural roads range from 12.0% to 32.3%, \nand are shown in Table A12.3. \n \nTable A12.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n($'000) \n \n   Costs    Benefits    \nGen \n      Total    VOC  Int'l Gen  Domestic      Total    Net \n   Capital  Maintenance  Costs    Savings  Traffic  Traffic  Poverty  Time  Benefits    Benefits \n2003    \u2014  \u2014    \u2014      \u2014    \u2014    \u2014    \u2014    \u2014    \u2014      \u2014 \n2004   3,189  \u2014    3,189      \u2014    \u2014    \u2014    \u2014    \u2014    \u2014     (3,189) \n2005   5,315  \u2014    5,315      \u2014    \u2014    \u2014    \u2014    \u2014    \u2014     (5,315) \n2006   6,378  77    6,454      146    \u2014    9    \u2014    3    157     (6,297) \n2007   6,378  89    6,467      382    \u2014    17    281    3    683     (5,783) \n2008    \u2014  89    89      1,055    \u2014    57    281    10    1,403      1,314  \n2009    \u2014  157    157      1,818    \u2014    103    281    19    2,220      2,062 \n2010    \u2014  157    157      1,944    664    110    281    20    3,020      2,862 \n2011    \u2014  157    157      2,080    1,355     118    281    22    3,856      3,699 \n2012    \u2014  157    157      2,225    2,034    126    281    24    4,690      4,533 \n2013    \u2014  157    157      2,331    2,129    132    281    25    4,899      4,741 \n2014    \u2014-  157    157      2,442    2,229    139    281    27    5,117      4,960 \n2015    \u2014-  157    157      2,557    2,333    145    281    29    5,346      5,188 \n2016    \u2014-  513    513      2,679    2,442    152    281    30    5,585      5,071 \n2017    \u2014-  157    157      2,805    2,556    160    281    32    5,835      5,677 \n2018    \u2014-  157    157      2,938    2,675    167    281    35    6,096      5,939 \n2019    \u2014-  157    157     3,077    2,800    175    281    37    6,370      6,212 \n2020    \u2014-  157    157     3,222    2,930    183    281    39    6,656      6,498 \n2021    \u2014-  157    157     3,374    3,067    192    281    41    6,955      6,797 \n2022    \u2014-  157    157     3,533    3,209    201    281    44    7,268      7,110 \n2023    \u2014  157    157     3,699    3,358    211    281    47    7,595      7,438 \n2024    \u2014  157    157     3,872    3,514    221    281    50    7,937      7,780 \n2025    \u2014  157    157     4,054    3,677    231    281    53    8,295      8,138 \n2026    \u2014  513    513     4,243    3,847    242    281    56    8,669      8,156 \n2027  (10,630) 157   (10,472)     4,441    4,025    253    281    59    9,059      19,532 \n                  Net Present Value     6,386 \n                  EIRR              15.8% \n\u2014  = no data available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return; VOC = vehicle operating costs. \nSource:  Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "54 Appendix 12 \n \nTable A12.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return for Project Road Sections \n \nSection  EIRR (%)  ENPV ($'000) \nDushanbe-Vahdat  30.1  858 \nVahdat-Faisabod  12.0         (19) \nFaisabod-Obigarm  15.8  3,484 \nObigarm-Nurobod  32.3  1,679 \nRural Roads  14.6  380 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; ENPV = economic net present value. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.

INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) report has been prepared \nto  evaluate  the  potential  effects  of  the  proposed  Dushanbe-Kyrgyz  Border  Road \nRehabilitation Project. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared under \nthe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance1  in  accordance  with  the  Environmental \nAssessment Requirements and Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure \nDevelopment Projects of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This SIEE incorporates \nfindings from the IEE led by the Ministry of Transport (MOT), and the project preparatory \nTA consultants, and has been reviewed by the Ministry of Nature Protection (MNP). \n \n2.  The scope and objectives of the IEE were to (i) ensure that environmental \nconcerns are fully taken into account in the consideration of alternatives and in the \ndesign and construction specification aspects of the Project2, (ii) review all possible \nenvironmental impacts during and after construction, including any possible need for \nland  acquisition  and  compensation/resettlement  arrangements  along  the  proposed \nalignment, and (iii) identify potential environmental issues to determine whether the \nProject warrants a full environmental impact assessment, pursuant to the requirements \nof ADB. \n \nII.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT \n \n3.  The Project will improve the Dushanbe-Nurobod (Darband) portion of the road \nfrom Dushanbe northeast toward the border with the Kyrgyz Republic. The Project will \nimprove about 140 kilometers of main highway and approximately 77 kilometers of rural \nroads feeding into the project road. The Project includes consulting services for project \nsupervision and monitoring, and procurement of equipment for road maintenance, and \nan associated advisory TA for capacity building and institutional strengthening. \n \nIII.  DESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT \n \n4.  Tajikistan is the most southerly of the Central Asian republics. It is bordered to \nthe north by the Kyrgyz Republic, in the east by the People's Republic of China, \nAfghanistan to the south, and Uzbekistan in the west. Total area is 143,000 square \nkilometers, divided into four regions: Sughd in the north, the Region of Republican \nSubordination (RRS) in the center, Khatlon in the south, and the mainly mountainous \nGorno-Badakshan in the east. The project area is located in the RRS. The population of \nTajikistan  was  about  6.12  million  in  2000.  Most  people  (74%)  live  in  rural  areas. \nAgriculture is the dominant economic activity and the largest source of income and \nemployment. The population has increased at an average annual rate of about 1.6% \nsince the mid-1990s. \n \n5.  The climate is continental, with cold winters and hot, dry summers, although the \nrelatively southerly latitude has an ameliorating impact, and altitude significantly affects \nlocal  climate.  The  project  area  is  in  the  dry  climate  belt,  with  annual  average \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Second Road Rehabilitation. Manila. \n2  MNP is planning to strengthen the environmental assessment process (e.g., to include social assessment) \nand improve efficiencies of study and approval. ", "Appendix 13  57\ntemperatures  ranging  from  12  degrees  centigrade  in  Dushanbe  to  -1.5  degrees \ncentigrade in the Obigarm-Tavildara Junction area. Elevations range from 850 meters \n(m) above sea el vel at Dushanbe to over 1,850 m above sea level near Obigarm. \nPrecipitation  ranges  from  650  millimeters  in  Dushanbe  to  1200  millimeters  in  the \nObigarm-Tavildara Junction area, which experiences about 1 m of snowfall per year. \n \n6.  Soils are typically silty gray-brown desert soils of alluvial origin and relatively low \ninherent fertility. The concentration of organic matter is low and erodibility is high. \nGroundwater levels are high. Water logging and secondary salinization are significant \nenvironmental  problems,  caused  by  failing  drainage  infrastructure  and  poor  water \nmanagement. Floods may occur at any time due to adverse weather. Tajikistan is \nmountainous, with only 960,000 hectares (ha) of arable land (7% of the total area). The \namount of arable land per rural household is only 0.9 ha, plus about 3.5 ha of pasture. \nSignificant areas of often steeply sloping land have been utilized, resulting in increased \nrisk of erosion. \n \n7.  Hydrological features in Tajikistan include glaciers and a network of rivers, lakes, \nand canals. Natural water quality is good. The quantity of industrial wastewater is small. \nThe main water pollution source is domestic sewage in settlements, villages, and cities. \nTajikistan\u2019s  hydropower  production  is  third  in  the  world  after  the  United  States and \nRussia. The most intense development of these resources has been in the Vakhsh \nValley where Tajikistan's highest dam (Nurek) is located.3 Due to the current low level of \nindustrialization, there are few air pollution sources and air quality, as expected, is good. \nThe  main  source  of  air  pollution  is  transport,  accounting  for  70%  of  the  total  air \npollutants. The dry climate causes natural air pollution (mist and dust storms) during the \nautumn-summer period. \n \n8.  Topographic characteristics, climate, and soil diversity define the variety of flora \nand fauna. Tajikistan hosts 5,000 plant species, 81 species of mammals, over 365 bird \nspecies, and 49 species of reptiles. Two hundred twenty-six plant species are included \nin the Red Book of Tajikistan as sensitive, or potentially threatened or endangered. The \nGovernment has created a number of reserves, national parks, biological research \nstations, and natural monuments. In practice, one specially protected reserve has been \ncreated in each natural climate belt. There are 4 reserves, 14 small reserves, and 2 \nnational parks. \n \nIV.  SCREENING OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS  \nAND MITIGATION MEASURES \n \nA.  Environmental Problems Due to Project Location \n \n9.  The Project will not have any negative environmental impact on archaeologically \nsignificant sites, nature protection areas, or other culturally important sites. Rehabilitation \nactivities will be confined to the existing right-of-way of the road. No significant changes \nof the hydrological characteristics of the project area are expected. The altered road \nembankment, borrow pits, and provisions for quarry operations, disposal sites, and \nminor changes in delineation to improve traffic safety will not require permanent land \nacquisition. In some of the road sections, landslides, rockslides, mudslides, flooding, or \nsoil subsidence pose risks. Erosion control of the embankments, pavements, and other \n                                                 \n3  The partially completed Rogun hydropower project, upstream of Nurek, will include the highest dam. ", "58 Appendix 13 \nroad structures will be taken into account everywhere in the project area, in accordance \nwith the quality standards for the design and construction of the rehabilitation works. \n \nB.  Environmental Problems Related to Design \n \n10.  Environmental  clearance  has  been  obtained  from  MNP,  the  central \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  regulatory  agency.  A  participatory  social  impact \nassessment has been made and is discussed in Appendix 3. No significant negative \nenvironmental impacts related to the design are foreseen, as long as the asphalt plants, \ncamps, borrow pits, and disposal sites are appropriately located, and national planning \nstandards are appropriately followed. Special attention needs to be paid to the design of \nthe infrastructure of the workers camps and to monitoring their water supply, wastewater \ntreatment, solid waste management, and overall sanitary conditions. \n \nC.  Environmental Problems Associated with Construction \n \n11.  The project area has significant topographic variation and naturally high erosion \nrates.  Detailed  requirements  for  upgrading  erosion  control  will  be  included  in \nconstruction contracts. Embankment slopes will be planted with grass or otherwise \nprotected after the works have been completed. Newer technologies such as hydro-\nseeding,  geotextiles,  and  drain  nets  can  be  used  in  locations  where  erosion  and \nrevegetation are difficult. Replanting work will be done as soon as possible after borrow \nwork is finished.  \n \n12.  Contracts will require that asphalt and hot-mix plants be located at least 500 m \naway from the nearest sensitive receptors, e.g., schools and hospitals. Asphalt will be \npurchased from permanent factories. Operators will be required to install noise and \nexhaust emission controls where applicable. Trucks carrying earth, sand, or similar \nconstruction materials or waste spoils will be covered to avoid generation of dust and \nspills. Care will be taken during the construction period to ensure that traffic disruptions \nto road transport are minimized. Detailed temporary arrangements are to be addressed \nin the context of detailed design and implementation planning of the rehabilitation works.  \n \n13.  In construction staging areas, equipment and vehicle fueling and maintenance \nmay cause contamination of soil and surface water unless controlled properly. During \nthe operation phase, soil and water pollution may result from spills of oil, fuel, and other \nhazardous or toxic cargoes. Fuel storage and refilling areas will be at least 300 m from \nall cross drainage structures and important water bodies, or as directed by the engineer. \nAn oil interceptor will be provided for washing down and refueling areas. Fuel will be \nstored  in  properly  protected  areas.  Construction  material  storage  areas  will  have \nappropriate rainfall control measures. Disposal of solid wastes into water bodies will be \nstrictly prohibited. Waste oils from construction equipment and vehicles and solid waste \nwith oil sludge will be collectively treated. \n \n14.  Construction camps will have septic tanks and controlled solid waste disposal \npits, which should be closed within a specified time after construction. Sewage and \ngarbage from construction camps will be collectively treated or made into fertilizer. Storm \nwater retention basins will be constructed to prevent pavement runoff from directly \nentering surface waters. Bridges, culverts, and drainage ditches will be designed to \nprevent damage to local irrigation systems. Culverts and drains will be cleared frequently \nto maintain storm water flow. Contractors will be required to provide basic emergency ", "Appendix 13  59\nhealth facilities for construction workers. Moreover, the contractor will be required to \nconduct a vigorous public health program to contain such contagious diseases as enteric \ndysentery, malaria, and common venereal maladies. Frequent educational meetings will \nbe held to inform the workers of the sources of these diseases and to explain how they \ncan be avoided. \n \n15.  To  ensure  contractors\u2019  compliance  with  the  environmental  regulations  and \nstandards,  regular  inspections  by  the  MOT  and  MNP  environmental  staff  and  local \ngovernment units will be undertaken. Their findings will be attached to the weekly and \nmonthly  progress  reports,  with  comments  on  the  possible  response  to  emerging \nenvironmental concerns. The inspections will cover all relevant issues, for instance the \nuse of appropriate materials, and include possible claims made by the affected people. \n \nD.  Environmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations \n \n16.  The planned road rehabilitation activities will increase traffic levels. The effect on \nair quality and noise levels is considered minor, and no particular mitigation measures \nare recommended. Despite low traffic volume on existing roads, emissions from most \nvehicles (particularly buses) are very high. About 80% of vehicles in the project area \nwere purchased before 1990, with about 40% purchased before 1980. Many vehicles \nhad been used at the time of purchase. Liquefied petroleum gas has been introduced \nand is used by some trucks and buses. \n \n17.  Road safety is expected to improve with the Project. Possible secondary benefits \ninclude  reduction  of  car  accidents  and  reduced  spills  of  hazardous  chemicals \ntransported by trucks. During operations, contingency plans will be in place for cleaning \nup  spills  of  oil,  fuel,  and  toxic  chemicals.  Maintenance  of  road  surfaces,  drainage \nfacilities, and landscaping should be enhanced to prevent soil erosion. \n \nV.  INSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL \nMONITORING PROGRAM \n \n18.  Environmental monitoring of the Project will be conducted by MOT and MNP. \nMOT  will  ensure  that  tender  documents  and  contracts  for  the  Project  incorporate \nenvironmental mitigation measures. MOT will supervise the consultants through weekly \ninspection visits to the sites (visual observations and communications) and preparation \nof  monthly  reports.  Institutional  requirements  for  the  Project  include  appropriate \nenvironmental  clearance  by  the  Government  and  local  government.  Construction \ncontractors  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  good  health  and  safety  practices, \nincluding dust and noise monitoring and mitigation for worker protection. Environmental \nmonitoring  will  pay  particular  attention  to  embankment  and  erosion  prevention \nrequirements, borrow pit restoration requirements, mining and quarry activities, siting of \nconstruction camps and related facilities, siting of asphalt plants, community relations, \nand  safety  provisions.  The  costs  for  the  consultants'  participation  in  environmental \nmonitoring is included in the budget for consulting services in Appendix 8. \n \n \n \n \n ", "60 Appendix 13 \nVI.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND INFORMATION DISCLOSURE \n \nA.  Public Consultation  \n \n19.  Public consultations were an integral part of project preparation. Surveys of 768 \nhouseholds were conducted from April through June 2002. Residents in the project area \nsuffer from unemployment and underemployment, and limited availability of energy, \nwater, and sanitation services. The key concerns noted were the selection of local roads \nto be included in the Project and potential employment opportunities generated. \n \nB.  Information Disclosure \n \n20.  The Project is classified as environment category B, and the 120-day public \ndisclosure rule does not strictly apply. The IEE and SIEE will be made available on \nrequest. \n \nVII.  FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n \n21.  Environmental issues that need to be addressed during implementation of the \nProject include the following: \n \n(i)  MNP will actively participate in monitoring during project construction, but \nwill  serve  primarily  as  an  oversight  agency.  MOT  will  have  primary \nresponsibility  for  monitoring,  as  it  does  for  the  ongoing  Road \nRehabilitation Project. National laws and guidelines will be followed, and \nadditional permit clearances will be obtained from other agencies as \nnecessary. \n \n(ii)  According to the IEE, all negative impacts resulting from the proposed \nroad rehabilitation project can be mitigated to an acceptable level. The \nproposed environmental mitigation measures should be included in the \nconstruction contracts.  \n \n(iii)  Environmental  management  will  be  an  integral  part  of  project \nmanagement.  Environmental  monitoring  reports,  based  on  routine \ninspections, will be submitted together with other project progress reports.  \n \n(iv)  Improved erosion control design and maintenance guidelines should be \nincorporated into the project design. \n \nVIII.  CONCLUSION \n \n22.  Based on the IEE, the Project will only have a limited number of minor negative \nenvironmental  impacts,  and  these  can  be  properly  mitigated.  No  large  construction \nactivities will take place. The IEE meets both Government and ADB standards and a \ndetailed environmental impact assessment for the Project or further special studies are \nnot warranted. \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R269-03 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20031209181200Z", "Title": "R269-03", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20040301141753+08'00'"}}
