THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Macroeconomic context. Nepal is at a pivotal stage in its development as it transitions \ninto  a  federal  system.  Despite  shocks  from  the  2015  earthquakes  and  2015\u20132016  trade \ndisruptions, the economy rebounded to grow at an average annual rate of 7.3% during FY2017\u2013 \nFY2019, as compared with 3.9% during FY2010\u2013FY2016. The government aims for Nepal to \ngraduate from least-developed country status by 2022 and reach middle-income status by 2030.1 \nThe recent move to a federal governance system mandated by the 2015 constitution offers \nopportunities to deliver better services for poverty reduction and enhanced economic growth. The \nkey challenge for Nepal is using this window of opportunity to lay a stronger foundation for \nsustained increase in economic growth and provide jobs for its young and growing labor force.  \nAddressing these challenges requires diversifying Nepal\u2019s economic base away from a heavy \nreliance on agriculture, remittances, and informal services towards higher-value industry and \nformal sectors, reducing the high unemployment rate (11.4%)2 and preparing the current as well \nas future workforce to be productive and competitive in the global market. Building a diversified \nand  agile  workforce  with  strong  foundational  and  higher-order  skills  while  simultaneously \nupgrading technical and specialized skills among new entrants and existing workers in the labor \nforce will be critical to the country\u2019s development goals. Thus, under the Fifteenth Plan for \nFY2020\u2013FY2024, the government has prioritized investing in human capital along with raising \nproductivity in agriculture and industry sectors, and effective implementation of the federal \ngovernance system to achieve high and inclusive economic growth (Footnote 1). \n \n2.  Education sector performance. A strong government commitment to broad, equitable \naccess to basic and secondary education over recent decades, underpinned by a policy of free \nand compulsory basic education and free secondary education, has yielded impressive results.  \nNet enrolment rate (NER) at the primary level increased from 81% in 2004 to 96% in 2019 while \nsecondary NER also increased over the past decade from 47% in 2008 to 62% in 2019. The \ncohort survival rate for grades 1\u201310 reached 58.5% from 37.9% in 2015.3 Nepal has also achieved \ngender parity in basic and secondary education.4 Formal technical and vocational education and \ntraining (TVET) has expanded rapidly since 2009\u20132010. Despite these improvements, access to \nsecondary\u2014and consequently to higher education\u2014and access to TVET remain limited.5 TVET \nenrolment was only 42,247 as of 2015.6 Moreover, 35.3% of youth aged 15\u201324 years were not in \neducation, employment or training in 2017.7 Quality and relevance of school education and TVET \ntraining also need improvement. For example, several rounds of the National Assessment of \nStudent Achievement data from 2011 to 2018 show that in grades 5 and 8, less than 20.0% of \nstudents can master competencies in problem solving and reasoning. Limited access, low quality \nand relevance in the school and TVET sectors mean that many young Nepalis are unable to \n \n1  National Planning Commission. 2019.

Kathmandu. \n ", "2   \nacquire the foundational and industry-relevant skills, and knowledge needed for the modern labor \nmarket and global economy. \n \n3.  The school education and TVET systems in Nepal face common challenges. These \ninclude the need to expand access, upgrade facilities and equipment, increase availability of \nqualified  subject  and  technical  specialists  in  science,  mathematics  and  technology,  more \nwidespread use of interactive teaching methods supported by appropriate teaching-learning \nmaterials, and strengthen quality standards. The TVET streams face additional challenges due to \noutdated curricula with low relevance to the labor market and limited employer involvement. \nInequities based on geographic region, ethnicity, caste, and income level persist  in basic, \nsecondary, and TVET education. In TVET, underfunding, weak sector leadership and affordability \nbarriers have constrained enrollment growth, while the academic pre-requisites, and a lack of \nclarity on equivalency and an urban focus further limit access. This highlights the need for stronger \npolicy and regulatory frameworks, more intensive investment in quality public institutions, and \ngreater engagement with private providers and employers.  \n \n4.  The transition to a federal system of government provides new opportunities to revitalize \nand reform education and training. The decentralization of TVET services to the provincial level \noffers the chance to establish more market-led and inclusive TVET systems tied to local labor \nmarkets. However, local government authorities are ill-equipped to take on these challenges.8 \nRural and urban municipalities will need to build skills in education planning and management. \nSkill needs at the provincial level will include curriculum development, assessment, and in-service \nteacher training. For TVET, skills will be needed in coordination of training, mobilization of \nbusiness and industry, labor market assessments and engaging the private sector. At the central \nlevel, the Center for Technical Education and Vocational Training will need continued support for \npolicy and planning, coordination, and development of curriculum, national vocation qualification \nframework, and accreditation standards. Support to institution strengthening for schools and \nTVET institutes will be critical to ensuring the success of decentralization. TVET institute directors \nwill require training in leadership, performance management, marketing, and engaging with local \ncompanies to identify training needs, develop new courses, introduce workplace-based training, \nand place graduates for employment.  \n \n5.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s assistance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been \na long-term partner in education sector development in Nepal, covering school education and \nTVET. ADB played a key role in supporting the government for reconstruction of schools affected \nby the 2015 earthquake. ADB currently supports the (i) Government\u2019s School Sector Development \nPlan (SSDP) in sector-wide approach to improve the equity, quality, efficiency, governance, and \nmanagement of school education, and (ii) Disaster Resilience of Schools Project to improve the \ndisaster  resilience  of  schools  by  supporting  school  infrastructure  investments,  disaster risk \nmanagement, and institutional strengthening.9 The current education TA portfolio consists of: (i) \n \n8  The article 232(1) of the new Constitution of Nepal mentions that \"the relations between the Federation, States, and \nLocal levels shall be based on the principles of cooperation, co-existence and coordination\" and Schedule 5\u20139 of the \nconstitution has vested exclusive and concurrent powers of different levels of government in relation to education. \nAlthough the federal education bills are under preparation for  clear roles and responsibilities, currently the following \nare tasked and the budget are transferred accordingly: The federal government has major responsibility for  policy, \nregulations, quality assurance, and assessments, while provincial government are tasked for TVET delivery, teacher \ntraining and provincial education policy. The local governments are responsible to deliver all basic and secondary \neducation. \n9  ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nSupporting  Education  and  Skills  Development,  aimed  to  support  policy  advisory,  project \nprocessing and implementation approved in 2013 with TA amount of $1.5 million.10 The TA \nresources are expected to be fully utilized by November 2020, and (ii) Supporting Policies and \nImplementation in the School Sector, approved in 2016 in the amount of $6.2 million, is a \npiggybacked TA to the ongoing SSDP and supports the implementation of the project.11   \n \n6.  Lessons learned from previous project preparation and implementation have highlighted \nthe importance of building the capacity at all levels of service delivery in ensuring quality at entry, \neffective implementation, and overall portfolio performance. ADB support will continue to add \nvalue by providing integrated and coordinated support to build a strong and resilient decentralized \neducation system. This will entail strengthening municipalities, schools, and TVET institutes to \nimprove service delivery and upgrade education quality. The TA facility will create synergy across \nthe  subsectors  by  sharing  lessons  across  projects  and  programs,  introducing  innovative \napproaches, strategic planning, and implementation support.   \n \n7.  Rationale for a transaction technical assistance facility. The proposed transaction \ntechnical assistance (TA) facility will support project preparation, capacity building, due diligence, \nand readiness for the Improved Access to Skills for Productive Employment Project (IASPEP) \nand Supporting School Sector Development Plan II (SSSDP II).12 It will also assist in the \nsubsequent implementation of IASPEP and SSSDP II. If the need arises, the TA facility may also \nsupport additional pipeline projects and programs that are included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, as agreed with the government during the TA facility\u2019s timeframe. \n \n8.  The TA facility is aligned with (i) ADB\u2019s strategy 2030,13 (ii) the government\u2019s School \nSector Development Plan (2016\u20132023),14 and (iii) Sustainable Development Goal 5.15 The TA \nfacility will support strategic policy advisory and technical inputs on school education and TVET \nissues, financial management, engineering and procurement, quality assurance, and evaluation \napproaches. It will bridge capability gaps, apply best practices, and foster innovative solutions for \ncommon challenges in the sector. In particular, the TA will bring in international expertise not \navailable  in-country  in  the  areas  of  curriculum,  pedagogy,  assessment,  public\u2013private \npartnerships, industry partnerships and TVET delivery. The TA facility approach is suitable as it \nwill enhance project preparation efficiency and improve project implementation readiness by (i) \nallowing the same experts to be mobilized for similar due diligence activities, (ii) facilitating \nlearning on project processing and implementation across different projects and programs, (iii) \ncreating synergies from working with common expertise and improving knowledge transfer, and \n(iv) strengthening coordination and synergy among various technical inputs and capacity building \nefforts. Overall, this TA facility will reduce transaction costs compared to resources required for \nseparate stand-alone transaction TA projects.  \n \n \n \n10 ADB. 2013.

These are (i) Preparing the Supporting School Sector Development Plan II; and (ii) Preparing the \nImproved Access to Skills for Productive Employment Project. \n13 Strategy 2030 operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequality; (ii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality; and (iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity. \n14 The government will prepare new education sector plan from July 2020 to be operational from July 2021 for education \ndelivery in federal structure.  \n15 Sustainable Development Goal 5: Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls. \n ", "4   \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Improved quality of design in education sector operations. This output will \nsupport the preparation of the SSSDP II and IASPEP. The scope of activities will include (i) \nanalytical studies such as sector assessments, technical assessments on curriculum, pedagogy, \npriority sectors and skills demands in different provinces, governance and capacity challenges, \nreview of existing results-based lending program and remaining areas for additional support (e.g. \nmodel schools); (ii) feasibility studies as required for the ensuing project; (iii) development of \nresults  frameworks  and/or  design  and  monitoring  frameworks;  (iv)  economic  and  financial \nassessments, and social, gender, and poverty analyses; (v) safeguard assessments, including \nenvironment and social safeguards, and climate change risk assessment; and (vi) due diligence \nin financial management, procurement, plus other institutional arrangements for executing and \nimplementing agencies. The output will also support projects to achieve project readiness through \nadvance procurement activities, where required.   \n \n10.  Output  2:  Strengthened  capacity  for  decentralized  project  implementation. \nTechnical expertise and capacity building support will be provided to executing and implementing \nagencies for the successful implementation and achievement of results for the school sector \nprogram and TVET projects. At the same time, the TA will support quality assurance mechanisms \nand systems, capacity building for gender, safeguards assessment and implementation, financial \nmanagement, and procurement. The TA will help build effective governance framework for project \nimplementation  including  planning,  execution,  fund-flow,  reporting,  and  monitoring  between \ncentral agencies and local governments and TVET institutes. Having a single TA facility will \nensure coordinated and integrated inputs across the various subsectors given the decentralization \nof education and TVET to the provincial level, which will promote synergy of results.  \n \n11.  Output 3: Enhanced application of innovative and evidence-based solutions for \nproposed and ongoing projects at the federal, provincial, and local levels. This output will \nbring in cutting edge global expertise to support project design and implementation as well as \nincrease exposure of government counterparts to innovative education practices. This output will \nsupport the exchange of national and international best practices in basic, secondary, and TVET \namong three tiers of the governments, TVET institutes and schools. Localized strategies will be \nbrainstormed with regard to the following topics: (i) learner centered approaches that build 21st \ncentury skills, including critical thinking and problem solving; (ii) inquiry-based and investigative \npedagogy such as integrating STEM approach to teaching and in the science and mathematics \ncurriculum; (iii) developing and conducting student assessments and examinations to improve \nlearning outcomes; and (iv) information and communication technology solutions for school \neducation and TVET (for example, EdTech programs in schools, teacher training, and for TVET \ndelivery). Support will be provided through seminars, workshops, and national and overseas study \nvisits, technical inputs and coaching during project preparation and implementation, if required. \nThis output will also document good design and implementation of programs and projects to \nshowcase effective strategies and solutions in the skills and education sectors. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a \n \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items \nare  listed  in  Appendix  1.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, office space, office supplies, secretarial and coordination assistance, and other \nin-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The executing agency will be the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MOEST). \nThe implementing agencies are the Center for Education and Human Resource Development; \nand Center for Technical Education and Vocational Training within MOEST.   \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA facility. The South Asia Human and Social Development \nDivision will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants in close coordination with the executing \nand implementing agencies. The TA facility will be implemented over 3 years, from July 2020 to \nJune 2023.   \n \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table below. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  July 2020 to June 2023 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MOEST) \nImplementing agency  Center for Education and Human Resource Development, \nMOEST; Center for Technical Education and Vocational Training, \nMOEST \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual: individual  International (20 person- $435,500 \nconsultant selection  months) and national (30 \nperson-months) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's TA \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB. \n \n16.

The TA facility will provide a total of 50 person-months\u2019 consultant \ninputs (20 person-months international and 30 person-months national) to support the preparation \nand implementation of the ensuing projects. The consultants will be recruited using individual \nconsultant selection method and deployed based on the requirements of each project being \nprepared or implemented. Individual consultant selection, rather than firm selection, is considered \nappropriate,  because  the  TA  facility  involves  multiple  activities  that  are  not  necessarily \ninterdependent and will require a varied range of consultants and services. ADB will engage the \nconsultants following the ADB Procurement Policy and Regulations (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.16  \n \nII.
