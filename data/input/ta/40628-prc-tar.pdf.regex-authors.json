INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance (TA) for preparing the Nanning\u2013Kunming Railway Capacity Enhancement Project for \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) financing. ADB considered this request, and a fact-finding \nmission  visited  the  project  area  in  October  2007,  carried  out  an  initial  poverty  and  social \nassessment  and  a  rapid  environmental  assessment,  and  discussed  technical  and \nsocioeconomic  issues  with  representatives  of  the  Government  and  provincial  and  local \ngovernments and the Ministry of Railways (MOR). This paper is based on the understanding \nreached  by  the  Government  and  the  mission  on  the  impact,  outcome,  output,  activities, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s country assistance program for 2007.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nA.   Growth in the Railway Transportation Sector \n \n2.  From 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, through to 2006, \nthe PRC has experienced sustained rapid economic growth, which has resulted in an rapid \nincrease in demand for transportation. Annual growth in passenger transport was 9% and freight \ntransport grew at 7.6% during 1978\u20132006. Railway is the principal mode of freight transport in \nthe PRC. In 2006, the modal split for freight ton-kilometers (km) was 47.5% for railways followed \nby 27.9% for inland waterways and seashore shipping, 21.1% for roads, 3.3% for pipelines, and \n0.2% for civil aviation. In 2006, road traffic accounted for 52.8% of total passenger-km, followed \nby railways with 34.5%, civil aviation with 12.3%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%. \n \n3.  The rapid economic growth has resulted in high demand for railway transportation. \nBetween 1978 and 2006, railway freight grew from 535 billion ton-km to 2,172 billion ton-km, \nequivalent  to  an  annual  growth  rate  of  5.14%;  passenger  traffic  grew  at  6.65%  annually, \nincreasing from 109 billion passenger-km to 666 billion passenger-km. The average distance for \npassenger journey in railways increased from 134 km in 1978 to 535 km in 2006, compared with \nthe average distance for passenger journey on roads, which grew from 35 km to 55 km over the \nsame period. For freight, the average railway journey is 770 km compared with 65 km for road in \n2006. Despite such growth rates, railway capacity has lagged behind demand because of \ninadequate transportation capacity in the system. Given the railway\u2019s important role in providing \neconomic transportation, these constraints will continue to affect efficient economic growth \nadversely if they are not removed. Because of these concerns, the Government has adopted an \naggressive plan to improve the railways, and has planned network extensions and construction \nin the underserved areas.  \n \nB.   Railway Strategy, Reforms, and Development Plan \n \n4.  The Government\u2019s policy on railway development is focused on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the capacity of the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint venture local \nrailways to promote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency and safety \nof the existing system by using new technology and modern management tools in planning and \noperation,  (iv)  reducing  operating  subsidies  through  appropriate  pricing  and  the \ncommercialization  of  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 March 2007.  \n ", "2   \nautonomy and accountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure \nand related services.  \n \n5.  The  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identified  transportation,  including  railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. By the end of 2005, a total investment of CNY308 billion for capital \nconstruction was made for constructing 6,458 km of new lines, providing 3,275 km of double \nlines and electrifying 6,259 km of tracks. In 2004, the State Council approved the new Railway \nDevelopment Plan covering the period up to 2020. The plan seeks to expand the railway \nnetwork from 72,000 km to 100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is a major goal. The \ntrain speeds will be raised to over 200 km per hour on the trunk network by 2020. Priority will be \ngiven to the development of railways in unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have \nremained less developed. The route network length will increase by 16,000 km in the western \nregion of the PRC to reach a network length of 40,000 km by 2020. To improve operational \nefficiency, steps will be taken to separate passenger and freight trains on key rail corridors.   \n \n6.  The 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) continues to emphasize railway development, and \nseeks to speed up railway construction. The plan envisages (i) constructing 17,000 km of new \nlines with the network length reaching over 90,000 route-km; and (ii) the length of the double \nlines and electrified lines reaching 45% of the network length. It seeks to (i) build a dedicated \npassenger railway network through the construction of passenger dedicated lines; (ii) develop \ncoal transport corridors by increasing the capacity of existing lines; (iii) expand the railway \nnetwork to 34,000 km in the poor western region; (iv) build international corridors at the borders \nin the southwest and northwest; and (v) develop a countrywide intermodal container network. \nThe total estimated investments are CNY1.5 trillion or about $190 billion over the next 5-year \nperiod.  \n \nC.   ADB Strategy and External Assistance  \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s strategy for the PRC railway sector focuses on (i) expanding the railway system \nby constructing new lines in unserved areas that are less developed and poor; (ii) promoting \nenergy conservation and environmental sustainability; (iii) modernizing equipment, enhancing \nsafety, and increasing the capacity to improve transport efficiency on key routes of the national \nrailway  system;  (iv)  commercializing  railway  operations  to  sustain  efficient  operations;  and \n(v) increasing railway competitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and reform. \nThe strategy will continue to focus on railway development in underserved areas in poor interior \nprovinces/region to link lower income regions with growth centers so as to facilitate pro-poor \ngrowth\u2014a  prerequisite  to  reducing  poverty.  Policy  issues  addressed  in  the  railway  sector \ninclude  institutional  development,  financial  reforms,  safety  enhancement,  development  of \ndedicated passenger lines, corporatization, marketing and business development, and tariff \nsetting with improved cost recovery. ADB has enhanced policy dialogue with MOR and is \nproviding TA support for policy reforms to MOR.2 This consultation will continue to further the \nreforms in the sector.  \n \n8.  ADB is the major source of external financing in the PRC railway sector, followed by the \nWorld  Bank.  ADB  has  focused  on  the  development  of  railways  in  less  developed  inland \nprovinces  to  promote  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  It  has  provided  14  loans  totaling  about \n$2.9 billion to finance the construction of about 1,921 km of provincial railways operated by joint \nventures with MOR, and 5,541 km of new railway lines under five national railway projects. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Railway Passenger and Freight Policy \nReform Study. Manila. \n ", "    3 \nSince 1984, the World Bank has provided 11 loans totaling over $2.6 billion for (i) 10 national \nrailway projects to expand railway capacity on high priority corridors, modernize system-wide \ntechnology, and strengthen institutional capabilities; and (ii) one local railway project. Since \n1979, Japan has provided about Y558 billion for 15 railway projects to expand rail transportation \ncapacity.  \n \nD.  Proposed Project \n \n9.  The project involves the construction of 755 km of class I double track electrified railway \nline, and the construction of 9 new and upgrading of 18 existing railway stations in the hilly and \nmountainous  area  in  Yunnan  and  Guizhou  provinces,  and  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous \nRegion. The railway will link Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province to Nanning, the capital of \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southwest PRC. Over 349 km of the railway line will \ntraverse Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 157 km will be in Guizhou Province, and 249 km \nwill go through Yunnan Province. The project impact area includes 18 counties and cities with a \ntotal population of about 7.5 million. The total rural population is about 71.2% (5.34 million) and \nabout 8% live below the poverty line.  \n \n10.  Most  people  living  in  the  area  work  in  agriculture,  characterized  by  a  low  level  of \nproductivity. Despite rich natural resources and good tourist potential, people have remained \nlargely poor and cut off from the mainstream development because of lack of transportation. \nThere is no expressway connecting this region, and the capacity of the existing single-line \nrailway is fully saturated. The existing road passes through difficult terrain, has limited passing \ncapacity, and is in poor condition. The proposed railway line will connect with Kunming\u2013Dali, \nKunming\u2013Chengdu, and Kunming\u2013Hekou at Kunming; Quijiang\u2013Liupanshui and Liupanshui\u2013\nWeishe in the north; Nanning\u2013Pingxian, Nanning\u2013Fangcheng, and Nanning\u2013Maoming on its \nway to Guangzhou; and Nanning\u2013Henyang and Nanning\u2013Huaihua in the north. The proposed \nrailway  will  also  connect  with  the  Nanning\u2013Qinzhou,  Nanning\u2013Guilin,  Longlin\u2013Baise  (ADB-\nfinanced),  Kunming\u2013Luliang\u2013Quijing,  Kunming\u2013Shilin,  Shilin\u2013Mengzi,  and  Kunming\u2013Yuxi \nexpressways. It provides the shortest link from Nanning to Kunming (755 km compared to 850 \nkm of road and 830 km of existing railway line) and will connect to the proposed Pan-Asian \nRailway going to Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. This will provide \naccessibility  to  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  through  Hekou,  Pingxian,  and  the  ports  of \nFangcheng and Beihai in the PRC; port of Haiphong in Viet Nam; and to South and Southeast \nAsia. It will help in promoting regional cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n \n11.  The project will help develop the railroad network in an unserved area and enhance pro-\npoor economic growth. It is included as a priority project in MOR\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan, as well \nas  the  railway  development  plan,  and  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  western  region \ndevelopment  strategy.  The  proposed  railway  will  facilitate  economic  development  and \nintegration of the poor western region, and is expected to stimulate industrial and natural \nresources  development  as  well  as  tourism  and  related  industries.  The  railway  will,  in  the \nconstruction and operation phase, increase local people\u2019s access to market and social services, \nand give them an opportunity to improve their standard of living. Completed and ongoing ADB-\nfinanced railway projects show that such projects create jobs in construction and loading and \nunloading operations as well as other income-generating activities (such as material and food \nsupply, and small services around construction sites). The lower transportation costs after \nproject completion will make goods and services available at more economic prices to people \nliving in the area, including the poor, and provide them with opportunities to sell their produce to \nbroader markets. Most people living in the project area have not traveled beyond the nearest \ntown because of high transport fares. The railway will offer them more affordable, reliable, and ", "4   \npunctual transport than is currently available. The project will improve local people\u2019s standard of \nliving; and influence all aspects of their daily life, directly or indirectly, in a positive manner. It is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy program3 and will support the Government\u2019s strategic \npolicy objective of greater developmental emphasis on poor, interior, and underserved areas of \nthe PRC by improving transportation linkage with growth centers. \n \n12.  The project envisages the construction of an electrified double-track railway line with \nsubgrades, bridges, and tunnels. Because of the hilly topography along the Nanning\u2013Kunming \nrailway route, tunnels and bridges will comprise 65% of the route length. \n \n13.  It will be undertaken as a joint venture between MOR and Yunnan and Guangxi Zhuang \nAutonomous Region provincial governments, and will be implemented by MOR. A feasibility \nstudy is being prepared, with cost estimates that reflect the current prices of materials and \nconstruction and traffic forecasts. MOR advised ADB that the project proposal is expected to be \nsubmitted to the National Development Reforms Commission by December 2007. The feasibility \nstudy, environmental impact assessment (EIA), and draft resettlement plan will be submitted to \nADB by February 2008. Resettlement under the project will be implemented in accordance with \nnational laws and provincial regulations, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The TA aims to help develop an efficient, reliable, and affordable railway transport \nsystem in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It will \n(i) help the Government in reviewing and strengthening the project feasibility study, EIA, plan for \nresettlement, and related studies to meet ADB requirements for possible financing; (ii) identify \npolicy  measures  and  institutional  development  needs  that  will  improve  railway  operational \nefficiency  and  management,  and  ensure  the  financial  sustainability  of  operations;  and \n(iii) identify the social dimensions to be incorporated in project design, including preparing an \nethnic minority development plan, and recommending measures to enhance social and gender \ndevelopment and reduce poverty in the project area. The outcome will be the design of a project \nsuitable for ADB financing. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The work under the TA will comprise the following: (i) reviewing and strengthening the \nfeasibility study to meet ADB requirements for (a) technical aspects related to construction and \noperation and railway safety; (b) economic and financial analyses, including a review of the \ntraffic forecast and financial performance of operation of the project facilities; and (c) financial \nmanagement assessment, including a review of budgetary and planning control, financial and \nmanagement  accounting,  and  internal  control  and  audit  systems;  (ii)  developing  a  set  of \nmeasurable performance indicators, including socioeconomic and poverty, and a sustainable \nmechanism for monitoring during and beyond the construction stage; (iii) recommending policy \nmeasures that will improve railway operational efficiency and management, and assessing \nspecific  institutional  development  needs  to  operate  the  project  facilities  commercially  and \nensure financial sustainability; (iv) reviewing the potential for private sector participation in \nconstruction, provision of services, and tourism development; (v) reviewing and updating the \nEIA  report  and  preparing  a  summary  EIA  with  appropriate  environmental  monitoring  and \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006.

The key \nactivities are field surveys; document review; data analysis; and consultations with stakeholders, \nincluding  government  officials,  project  beneficiaries,  and  affected  persons  (including  ethnic \nminority groups, women, and the poor).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $670,000 equivalent, of which the Government \nrequested that ADB finance $500,000 (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  MOR  will  provide  the  remaining  $170,000  equivalent  in  local \ncurrency cost for counterpart staff members, office facilities, and support services and local \ncommunications. The Government and MOR were advised that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will require about 39 person-months of consulting services (15 international and \nabout 24 national) spread over 5 months, including fieldwork. The consultants will be engaged \nby ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). A consulting firm will be selected and engaged following the quality and cost-\nbased selection method, and simplified technical proposals will be required. The international \nconsultants will have expertise in transport economics, traffic forecasting, railway engineering \nand  operation,  institution  building,  resettlement,  and  social  and  poverty  analysis.  These \nconsultants  will  also  have  expertise  in  financial  analysis,  financial  management,  and \nenvironmental sciences. Expertise required from national consultants will be in the fields of \ntransport economics, railway engineering and operation, and resettlement and socioeconomics. \nEnvironmental engineering will also be an area of expertise. Appendix 4 gives the outline terms \nof reference for consulting services. The consultants will procure equipment in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), and will be handed over \nto the Executing Agency on completion of TA. \n \n18.  The TA is expected to begin in May 2008 and be completed by December 2008. MOR, \nas the Executing Agency, will be responsible for supervising and monitoring TA activities. The \nGovernment and MOR agreed to provide the assistance required for implementing the TA. MOR \nwill  make  available  (i)  all  relevant  reports,  studies,  and  information;  (ii)  suitable  office \naccommodation and appropriate and qualified counterpart staff; (iii) local transport facilities \nneeded to visit the site; and (iv) any other assistance that the consultants may reasonably \nrequest, including liaison with the Government and local authorities. \n \nIV.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nBetter railway transport will provide an enabling environment for poverty reduction through improved access to markets, \nemployment, advanced education and medical facilities, new knowledge and information, families working or studying in other \nregions, other social and economic services, and facilitation of economic development and job creation. Improved access to \nmarkets opens up opportunities for expansion of locally produced goods and services. Construction and operation of the \nrailway generates additional employment opportunities in local communities, providing an additional source of income for \npeople, including poor households in the project area. This will speed up economic growth in this area, benefiting local \nresidents, including the poor. \n \nB.  Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);   Geographic (TI-G);   Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification: The project rationale is based on economic development, but some \ncomplementary measures can be included in project design and implementation to enhance social inclusion. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence?  \n  Social and poverty analysis will be conducted as was done for previous railway projects. Further analysis will be required \nfor this project because many of the local people are ethnic minorities and the poverty incidence is quite high in some \ncounties within the project area. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)?  \n  Yes, all railway projects have included pro-poor design elements and this project area has both great need and \nopportunities. The proposed measures will be included in the ethnic minority development plan (EMDP).  \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject?  \n  The primary beneficiaries are people and industries located in the cities and towns along the proposed alignment. \nHowever, the existing and future local road networks will ensure that benefits flow to smaller towns and rural areas in the \ncounties the project will pass through. The People\u2019s Republic of China policy for micro-urbanization, whereby rural \nresidents migrate into local towns and cities for nonfarm jobs, will be significantly advanced by the railway project. The \nrailway construction will also generate many temporary jobs for unskilled local laborers, which will help them make the \ntransition to permanent off-farm employment.   \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project?  \n  The local people and industries need modern transport services, which will be provided by the new railway; in particular, \nstations areas will become hubs for new economic growth. The rural communities will require better local road networks \nto benefit fully from the railway. The rural poor will need some training and preferential hiring for construction jobs. \nSpecial attention will be given to ethnic minorities. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem?  \n  Many of the rural villages in the mountainous areas have no transport access. This is the reason for high poverty \nincidence. The government policy is to encourage people to move to towns and cities, but many ethnic minorities are \nreluctant to do so. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. Government, urban communities, industries, villages, and residents. \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based  organizations,  etc.)? \nCommunity meetings will be conducted to discuss the station area development plans. Village meetings will be \nconducted for resettlement planning to ensure good economic rehabilitation measures are formulated. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making          Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \nC&P plans will be prepared for the resettlement plan (RP) and the EMDP. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program?  \n  The improved railway transport will benefit women equally and will enhance their mobility. Employment opportunities for \nwomen will occur during and after project completion (e.g., unskilled work during construction, station area development, \nand induced economic development). \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?    \n          Yes          No    Please explain.  \n       Women will have improved access to higher quality services in cities along the railway line. \n \n3.  Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?      \n    Yes          No    Please explain  \n       The project will cause adverse impacts because of land acquisition and resettlement, which will be addressed in the RP, \nand increased risk of communicable diseases, which will be addressed in the EMDP. Livelihood opportunities and \ntraining requirements will be included in the RP. \n \nIII.
