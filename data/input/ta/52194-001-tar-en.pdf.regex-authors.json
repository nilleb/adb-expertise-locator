INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster will support the green \ndevelopment of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nIt will (i) support research on enabling policies, regulations, and incentive mechanisms needed to \nachieve the environmental goals and objectives outlined for the YREB region; and (ii) undertake \nanalytical work needed to design and implement demonstration projects.  \n2.  The TA cluster subprojects were developed at the request of the Government of the PRC \nwith the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to support the strategic project \ninvestments of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for achieving targets outlined in the YREB \ndevelopment plan.1 The TA cluster subprojects were included in the country operations business \nplan for the PRC, 2018\u20132020.2 In addition, they are consistent with the focus of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 and its development agenda of supporting institutional reform and achieving environmentally \nsustainable growth,3 which are the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s assistance to the PRC.4 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Rural vitalization in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. Among the rural villages in the \nYREB, about 40% do not have garbage collection facilities and about 80% lack basic sewage \ntreatment, contributing to poor environmental conditions. The environmental quality of these rural \nareas is further exacerbated by agriculture-related nonpoint source pollution from outdated \nproduction systems lacking effective waste management systems. Because of these concerns, \nthe NDRC released guidelines on a rural vitalization strategy on 2 January 2018, identifying \nagriculture, farmers, and rural areas as major bottlenecks to achieving the PRC\u2019s economic \ndevelopment and environmental restoration goals.5 Under the rural vitalization strategy, the PRC \nseeks to modernize agriculture and rural villages through a range of measures, including (i) \nbuilding ecological villages; (ii) improving provision of basic public services (including rural \nsanitation, solid waste collection, and nonpoint source pollution control); and (iii) improving rural \ngovernance. These issues complement and are closely aligned with the goals in the YREB \ndevelopment plan and are the focus of the TA cluster, sharing common outcomes for ecological \nand environmental improvement (footnote 1). \n4.  Government strategy. The outline of the YREB development plan was released by the \ngovernment in September 2016 to guide the future development of the YREB toward the goal of \necological restoration and green development (footnote 1). The outline prescribes the following \nenvironmental improvement targets by 2020: (i) over 75% of Yangtze River water meets the class \nIII standard or above, compared with 68% in 2014; and (ii) forest coverage reaches 43.0%, \ncompared with 41.3% in 2014.6 In February 2018, the Ministry of Finance issued a guidance \ndocument on establishing and improving a long-term mechanism for ecological compensation \nand protection in the YREB.7 This document outlines a clear framework for implementing eco-\ncompensation programs and is consistent with the objectives and goals of the TA cluster. \n                                                \n1  Government of the PRC, NDRC. 2016.

ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020,8 aligned with \nthe PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, also supports the government\u2019s reform agenda \nand the YREB targets by focusing on the following strategic priorities: (i) managing climate change \nand the environment; (ii) promoting regional cooperation and integration; (iii) supporting inclusive \neconomic growth; (iv) fostering knowledge cooperation; and (v) supporting institutional and \ngovernance reform.9 \n6.  ADB\u2019s framework approach for the Yangtze River Economic Belt. ADB is playing a \ncatalytic role by focusing its limited resources to work together with different YREB stakeholders \nto develop and promote innovative yet replicable approaches for scaling up in each of the \nstrategically  selected  priority  areas  where  ADB  has  institutional  advantages.  ADB  and  the \ngovernment have agreed to adopt a framework approach, providing about $2.0 billion of funding \nin the YREB during 2018\u20132020 to strategically program ADB\u2019s lending support for development \ninitiatives in the YREB with priority given to the following four areas: (i) ecosystem restoration, \nenvironmental protection, and water resources management; (ii) green and inclusive industrial \ntransformation;  (iii)  construction  of  an  integrated  multimodal  transport  corridor;  and  (iv) \ninstitutional strengthening and policy reform. These priorities will complement each other to \nsupport the overall ecological restoration and protection of the YREB. The individual projects may \nbe in one or more of the core operational sectors of ADB\u2014environment, agriculture and natural \nresources, transport, energy, and urban development. \n7.  The TA cluster offers an additional avenue of strategic yet complementary support to \nplanned ADB lending and nonlending assistance in the YREB. The themes of the four TA cluster \nsubprojects (Appendix 2) cut across key strategic priority areas consistent with ADB\u2019s YREB \nframework  approach,  addressing the  areas  of  (i)  ecosystem  restoration  and  environmental \nprotection; and (ii) institutional strengthening and policy reform, including capacity building. In \nparticular, eco-compensation has been identified by the government as an important innovative \nfinancing mechanism to address both ecosystem restoration and rural poverty reduction in the \nYREB.  ADB  is  also  co-leading  with  the  China  Council  for  International  Cooperation  on \nEnvironment and Development a 2-year special policy study on eco-compensation and green \ndevelopment institutional reform in the YREB during 2018\u20132019 to create an enabling policy \nframework for effective implementation of eco-compensation schemes. \n8.  The executing agencies associated with the TA cluster subprojects are closely involved in \nthe key strategic areas under the YREB development plan and the rural vitalization strategy \n(footnotes 1 and 5). In Guizhou, situated in the upper Yangtze River catchment area, the Guizhou \nprovincial government through the Guizhou Provincial Finance Department (subproject 1) is \nsupporting the project activities that aim to protect and improve ecological and environmental \nprocesses critical to achieving the YREB development plan outcomes. The NDRC, through the \nWestern  Region  Development  Department  (subproject  2)  and  the  Chongqing  Municipal \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (subproject 3), is a key player in the project activities that \nsupport the design and implementation of eco-compensation and related incentive mechanisms \naligned with ecological protection and environmental improvement outcomes under the YREB \ndevelopment  plan  and  the  rural  vitalization  strategy.  The  State  Forestry  and  Grassland \nAdministration under the Ministry of Natural Resources (subproject 4) plays a significant role in \nthe PRC\u2019s ecological recovery initiatives. \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2016.

The TA cluster builds on ongoing and previous ADB-financed investments of \nover $10 billion in various sectors and provinces in the YREB during 2000\u20132015. Although many \nof ADB\u2019s investment projects have successfully functioned as demonstration projects and have \nenabled scaling up of lessons to other regions of the PRC and Asia and the Pacific, opportunities \nremain for further improvement. Some ADB investments in the PRC have typically responded to \nthe demands of individual provinces and municipalities as stand-alone interventions. In addition, \ncoordination of projects across sectors and administrative boundaries in the YREB, mechanisms \nof learning, and replication of lessons could be further improved to maximize synergies, co-\nbenefits, and sustainability. \n10.  Strategic  fit.  The  TA  cluster  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  (i)  Environment  Operational \nDirections, 2013\u20132020, which  aim to help Asia and the Pacific transition to environmentally \nsustainable or green growth; and (ii) Strategy 2030 (footnote 3).10 The project is also in line with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020 in supporting the government\u2019s goal \ncited in the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, on balancing the role of government, \nsociety,  and  the  market  to  deliver  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  development \n(footnotes 8 and 9). \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n11.  A TA cluster modality was determined to be the most appropriate means of providing \nstrategic and targeted support for the YREB development plan (footnote 1). Linked TA cluster \nsubprojects  will  support  a  program  of  activities  covering  capacity  development  and  the \ndevelopment of enabling policies and regulatory frameworks, with the common objective of \nsupporting the  implementation  of  demonstration  projects  aligned  with  targets  in the  YREB \ndevelopment plan. The TA cluster modality provides the flexibility to support emerging needs \nthrough the design of the TA cluster subprojects during TA implementation. Since the PRC has a \nTA framework agreement for the YREB and the TA cluster subprojects have been programmed \nas knowledge and support TA projects, the TA approach is more appropriate because greater \nknowledge sharing and cooperation can be achieved within the TA cluster.11 \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n12.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impact: green economic development and \necological protection in the YREB achieved (footnote 1).12 The TA cluster will have the following \noutcome:  design  and  implementation  of  eco-compensation  and  ecosystem  protection \ndemonstration projects enhanced.13 The outputs of the TA cluster subprojects will also reflect the \noutputs of the overall TA cluster. \n \n13.  Output  1:  Enabling  environment  for  ecological  compensation  demonstration \nstrengthened. Output 1 will support the development of policies, regulations, and incentive \nmechanisms needed to establish appropriate policy and institutional frameworks that will facilitate \neffective ecological restoration and environmental improvement demonstration projects in the \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2013.

Output 1 will be delivered through the preparation of research reports, and findings will be \nshared through training programs under the TA cluster subprojects. \n14.  Output  2:  Capacity  on  integrating  poverty  reduction  targets  into  innovative \nfinancing  mechanisms  for  ecosystem  protection  enhanced.  Output  2  will  support  the \nstrengthening of the project designers\u2019 capacity to effectively undertake analytical assessments \nneeded for designing comprehensive ecosystem protection demonstration projects. Output 2 will \nbe delivered through the preparation of research reports, which will be disseminated through the \nTA cluster subprojects\u2019 training programs. \n15.  Output 3: Knowledge on lessons and findings disseminated. Output 3 will support the \npreparation and publication of at least two knowledge products, including policy briefs and case \nstudy research reports, which will summarize the findings and facilitate the dissemination of key \nlessons as well as the design and delivery of targeted training programs and study tours.14 The \nTA cluster subprojects 2 and 3 (Appendix 2) will primarily contribute to this output. \nB.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $1,700,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government \nand the TA cluster subprojects\u2019 respective executing and implementing agencies will provide \ncounterpart costs and services, which are estimated to account for 12% of the total TA cluster \ncost. Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements will be presented in each TA cluster \nsubproject proposal, which will be submitted for approval following approval of the TA cluster by \nend September 2018. Once the additional financing resources have been identified during TA \nimplementation, they will be mobilized to support the TA cluster subprojects, as and when needed. \n17.  For  each  TA  cluster  subproject,  the  government  and  the  respective  executing  and \nimplementing agencies will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nfacilities, domestic transportation, provision of subject-related government data and studies for \nthe TA consultants\u2019 use, provision of meeting rooms, and other in-kind contributions. \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The  Environment,  Natural  Resources,  and  Agriculture  Division  of  ADB\u2019s  East  Asia \nDepartment will administer the TA cluster. Each TA cluster subproject proposal will be submitted \nto the head of the department in accordance with the business process for knowledge and support \nTA  cluster  processing.15 Subproject  activities  will  start  only  after  approval.  The  indicative \nimplementation arrangements and the executing and implementing agencies for the TA cluster \nsubprojects are outlined in Table 1. \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  October 2018\u2013December 2020 \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agencies  Subproject 1: Guizhou Provincial Finance Department \nSubproject 2: Western Region Development Department, NDRC \nSubproject 3: Chongqing Municipal Development and Reform Commission, NDRC \nSubproject 4: State Forestry and Grassland Administration, MNR \n                                                \n14 Study tours will be conducted in ADB\u2019s developing member countries.  \n15 ADB\u2019s Office of the General Counsel will review the draft TA cluster subproject proposals following ADB. 2017. \nBusiness Processes for Knowledge and Support Technical Assistance.
