A  statistical  business  register  (SBR)  is  a  register  of  enterprises  or  establishments \ninvolved in a business activity that is maintained by national statistical offices (NSOs) or other \nparts of national statistical systems. An SBR is closely linked to business registries. Business \nregistries facilitate registration of businesses according to a country\u2019s regulatory requirements; \nand may reside in different geographical locations, ministries, or regulatory authorities. An SBR \nis  usually  centralized  in  NSOs  and  draws  on  information  from  these  business  registers, \nassembled into a directory of businesses that is used to draw sample and population data for \nconducting surveys and censuses to produce official statistics in accordance with international \nstandards and frameworks such as the System of National Accounts 2008.  \n \n2.  Many developing member countries (DMCs) in Asia and the Pacific, with the support of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), are modernizing and improving their business registries to \nimprove the overall business environment and facilitate private sector development.1 Given the \nclose link between business registries and SBRs, and the strong demand in the region for \nassistance in this area,  there is an opportunity and a need to support DMCs in establishing and \nimproving their SBRs.2 This technical assistance (TA) will build on and complement ongoing \ninitiatives of ADB\u2019s regional departments by strengthening the link between SBRs and business \nregisters; ensuring that the information collected via business registries is optimized by national \nstatistical systems; and contributing toward improved coordination among national agencies in \nthe collection and compilation of data on small, medium-sized, and large enterprises.3 These \nefforts will aid in improving and expanding the statistical information on small, medium-sized, \nand large enterprises, and reducing costs and time required to respond to statistical surveys. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The benefits of having well-established and functioning SBRs go well beyond improving \nthe quality of economic and business statistics, as SBRs have the potential to enrich the depth \nof knowledge about establishments. Having good SBRs can improve the basic information on \nsmall, medium-sized, and large enterprises. SBRs provide valuable information not only about \nthe number of enterprises, their births and survival rates, but also their key characteristics such \nas principal activity, number of employees, and size of turnover. Such structural business \nstatistics, lacking in DMCs, would have been useful inputs into strategy formulation and impact \nevaluation  of  development  projects,  national  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs) \ndevelopment  policies,  and  related government support measures. Given  that  a majority of \nworkers in many DMCs are employed in SMEs, and the role SMEs play in lifting people out of \npoverty, SBRs can contribute to meeting data needs for timely intervention to enhance the role \nof SMEs in national strategies for growth, job creation, and social cohesion. 4 Further, as SMEs \n                                                \n1  For example, a project loan by ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department with the Department of Enterprise and \nRegistration Management in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; and the support of ADB\u2019s Central and West \nAsia Department for one-stop shops for business registration in Armenia and the Kyrgyz Republic.   \n2  Statisticians from ADB\u2019s Development Indicators and Policy Research Division (ERDI) work closely with most of the \nnational statistical systems in the region, and are members of a number of committees or steering groups on \nofficial statistics. These networks and forums have been used for consultation with national NSOs and national \nstatistical systems, which have expressed interest in the initiative and described it as highly relevant to their \ncountries or region and in addressing significant capacity development gaps. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 December 2013. \n4  S. Shinozaki. 2012. A New Regime of SME Finance in Emerging Asia: Empowering Growth-Oriented SMEs to \nBuild Resilient National Economies. ADB Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration. No. 104. \nManila: ADB. \n ", "2  \nare crucial to more sustainable and inclusive growth, they can only fulfill this potential if they can \nobtain the finance necessary to start and grow their businesses. Here, SBRs can assist in \nnarrowing the supply\u2013demand information gap in SME finance, and contribute to broadening \nnew financing modalities that SMEs can access.  \n \n4.  In many DMCs, pressure is increasing to reduce the burden on enterprises to supply \ninformation for statistical surveys while data users and policy makers are constantly presenting \nnew requirements. Well-established SBRs can assist in reconciling these conflicting needs by \nallowing surveys to be distributed more effectively and economically between enterprises, and \nin so doing reduce the response burden and improve the efficiency of the overall data collection \nprocess. For instance, using the same information for different purposes, the total amount of \ninformation requested each time can be reduced. Response burden is particularly high among \nenterprises  in  DMCs,  as  statistical  surveys  are  often  uncoordinated  among  the  national \nstatistical systems and government agencies, resulting in a high percentage of non-responses \nto statistical surveys. SBRs can also be used to incorporate survey results with administrative \ndata such as those obtained from tax authorities to provide improved basis for production of \nofficial statistics. Further internationalization and formation of multinational enterprise groups \nspanning geographical boundaries have been increasing in the recent past and have become \nan  important  part  of  the  industrialization  landscape  in  many  DMCs.  However,  correctly \naccounting for their contribution in countries\u2019 macroeconomic statistics (gross domestic product, \ngross national income, balance of payments, foreign direct investment, etc.) can be challenging. \nBy profiling these complex enterprises and mapping their structure and activities, SBRs can \nmeet the needs of policy makers, and ensure that their full contribution is reflected correctly and \nconsistently across all relevant statistics.   \n \n5.  A 2009 regional survey indicated that only 29 out of 45 ADB DMCs had functioning \nSBRs, of which only 18 had what could be described as comprehensive SBRs.5 The situation in \nAsia  and  the  Pacific  differs  considerably  from  the  more  developed  statistical  systems  of \ncountries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which treat SBRs \nas foundations of their national statistical systems, ensuring that they are up-to-date, integrated, \nand comprehensive. The importance of SBRs has also been recognized in the African region, \nwhere the African Development Bank recently developed Guidelines for Building Statistical \nBusiness Registers in Africa, and is working with its member countries on their application. \n \n6.  The need to establish and improve SBRs in Asia and the Pacific has been identified as a \ntop regional priority for statistical development by the United Nations Economic and Social \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) Committee on Statistics, of which ADB is a \nmember. The Committee on Statistics, the highest intergovernmental forum for statistics in Asia \nand the Pacific, which brings together the heads of national statistical systems from the region \nand international organizations involved in statistical development (including ADB), recognized \nthis importance by endorsing the regional program for the improvement of economic statistics in \nAsia and the Pacific at its session in 2010 and the implementation plan for the regional program \nin  2012. 6 These  documents  identify  SBRs  as  one  of  the  fundamental  components  of  the \nstatistical infrastructure needed for the production of a core set of economic statistics, and \n                                                \n5  Based on United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). 2009.

Yet \ndespite this recognition, very little support is provided to DMCs, and no coordinated regional \nassistance  is  being  implemented.  National  statistical  systems  from  the  region  have  also \ncommunicated the need for support in this area to statisticians in ADB\u2019s Development Indicators \nand Policy Research Division (ERDI), who work closely with most of them and are members of \na number of committees and steering groups on official statistics. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA\u2019s impact will be an improved information on small, medium-sized, and large \nenterprises  and  reduction  in  response  burden  of  enterprises  in  participating  DMCs.  More \neffective utilization of SBRs, combined with administrative data, will result in improved quality of \nofficial statistics, including statistics on enterprises, and will provide a better basis for informed \nand timely decision making. Efficiency of statistical collections is expected to improve with better \ndistribution of surveys across the business population, thus reducing the reporting and collection \ncosts or burden for both business enterprises and statistical systems.  \n \n8.  The TA\u2019s outcome will be an increased number of SBRs established or improved in \nparticipating DMCs. Providing DMCs with the necessary training, advice, and guidance, as well \nas facilitating sharing of knowledge and enabling better access to tools, will assist DMCs in \nestablishing and improving SBRs to meet the needs of their national statistical systems.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The focus of the TA will be on developing the necessary capacity within the NSOs to \nestablish  and  maintain  SBRs  on  a  sustainable  basis.  The  TA  will  target  three  groups  of \ncountries: those without any functioning SBR (first level); those with SBRs, which could benefit \nfrom  assistance  to  integrate  multiple  SBRs  into  a  single  SBR  and  improve  the  use  of \nadministrative data sources for their maintenance (second level); and those with reasonably \nwell-functioning SBRs, which could use assistance with developing the capacity to profile large \nbusiness enterprises (third level).7  \n  \n10.  For DMCs in the first level, the aim will be to assist in developing the necessary tools to \nestablish basic SBRs. The approach will be to focus initially on establishing a registry covering \nlarge businesses, using employment size or output contribution to the sector or economy as the \ncriterion. Such information can be obtained from the latest surveys and censuses conducted by \nNSOs and national statistical systems, and from entities mandated to register businesses. A \nmechanism will be developed where entities entrusted with registering businesses submit such \ninformation to the NSOs. On this aspect, ERDI will coordinate with regional departments of \nparticipating countries. The next step would be to expand the coverage progressively to all \nbusinesses within the scope of formal enterprises as nationally defined. For DMCs in the \nsecond level, the aim is to integrate existing SBRs that may be with various line ministries into a \nsingle  comprehensive  registry  (centralized  in  the  NSO),  and  expand  the  use  of  available \nadministrative  and  other  data  sources.  ERDI  will  coordinate  with  the  respective  regional \ndepartments  to  facilitate  this  process.  For  the  level  three  DMCs,  the  main  aim  will  be  to \n                                                \n7  Discussions with regional departments are ongoing for inclusion of selected countries in the TA. Prospective \ncountries  include:  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Malaysia,  Mongolia,  Sri  Lanka,  and \nTajikistan.  \n \n ", "4  \ninstitutionalize  profiling  of  large  businesses  and  complex  enterprises,  and  develop  the \nnecessary capacity to produce business population statistics. For countries in this group, it is \nenvisaged that a comprehensive SBR already exists and ERDI would work directly with the \nNSOs in creating greater value added to the data and information contained within the SBRs. \n \n11.  An assessment will be conducted to appraise the current statistical infrastructure and \ncapacity  within  participating  DMCs,  the  state  of  the  existing  SBRs,  key  stakeholders,  and \navailable data sources. Existing networks established through the various statistical capacity \nbuilding initiatives will be used to facilitate the assessment process. Following the assessment, \nnational workshops will be organized to bring together key stakeholders (national statistical \nsystems, business registration authorities, tax authorities, etc.) to formulate national proposals \nfor developing and improving SBRs to meet the needs of the NSOs and national statistical \nsystems  toward  the  production  of  economic  and  business  statistics  needed  for  informed \ndecision making.  \n \n12.  Implementation of the national proposals for developing and/or improving SBRs will be \nachieved through a range of capacity building activities including training programs, workshops, \nand seminars; and providing guidance and sharing of experiences through cooperation among \ndeveloping  countries  and  study  visits  to  NSOs  in  the  region  with  well-established  SBRs. \nInformation technology assistance would be provided to countries where this may be needed in \nrelation to the establishment and improvement of SBRs  and is found lacking. Access to tools \nused by other statistical systems in the region will also be facilitated. \n \n13.  In all instances, the conceptual basis will be examined and assistance provided with \ndefining the statistical unit in line with international frameworks and applying internationally \naccepted definitions of small, medium-sized, and large enterprises. Support will be provided, \nwhere necessary, with organizational agreements between the national statistical systems and \ndata providers to facilitate smooth cooperation among all parties. In addition, strategies for \ncontinuing maintenance and improvement of SBRs will be formulated with country consultation \nand participation to ensure that the SBRs are sustained after the end of the project. To this end, \nthe confirmation of no-objection to be obtained from participating countries will indicate that the \nresponsibility of sustaining the SBR rests with the country. \n \n14.  To share the knowledge gained during implementation of the TA with other national \nstatistical  systems  in  the  region,  a  standardized  guide  for  national  statistical  systems  on \ndeveloping and improving SBRs will be produced and disseminated. A regional workshop will \nalso be organized for staff of national statistical systems to be trained on developing and \nimproving SBRs. Furthermore, an Asia and the Pacific informal network for SBR experts will be \nestablished at ADB to facilitate future collaboration in this area among countries. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. The TA will be implemented by ERDI staff \nwith support from international and national consultants for 38 months, beginning in January \n2014 until its targeted completion in February 2017, in collaboration with participating DMCs. \n ", "  5\nERDI will closely coordinate with the regional departments and resident missions to ensure that \nthe  TA  builds  on  and  complements  any  ongoing  ADB  initiative  aimed  at  modernizing, \nstrengthening, and improving business registration within ADB DMCs. \n \n17.  The TA will be administered in collaboration with the NSOs of six selected DMCs. In \ninstances where the NSO is not responsible for the SBR, a lead government agency will be \nidentified as the national implementing agency (NIA). The NIA will coordinate country-level \nactivities. Where costs of country-level activities (such as country workshops and training) are to \nbe administered by the NIA, funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures and \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s advance payment facility. Confirmation of no-objection will be obtained \nfrom the government of each participating DMC prior to starting TA activities, in coordination \nwith ADB regional departments and resident missions. Participating DMCs will be expected to \nprovide complementary government inputs in the form of office space and staff resources.  \n \n18.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  coordination  with  other  agencies  involved  in  the \nimprovement of economic statistics. Reports on the key milestones will be provided to the \nSteering Group for the Regional Programme on Economic Statistics under the Committee on \nStatistics under UNESCAP. Where possible, the TA will be implemented in collaboration with \npartners of excellence such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics, United Nations agencies, and \nexpert groups that specialize in this area such as the Wiesbaden Group on Business Registers.  \n  \n19.  The TA is expected to finance up to 64 person-months of consulting services and will \nrequire  two  international  statisticians  (8  person-months  total);  one  international  manuscript \neditor (1 person-month); three national information technology experts (15 person-months total); \nthree national statisticians (15 person-months total); and one national consultant (25 person-\nmonths). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. All consultants will be \nselected and engaged individually by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). ERDI will designate a national staff for \ncontract administration on a regular basis to ensure smooth processing and implementation. \nProcurement  and  disbursement  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as \namended from  time  to time)  and  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). Proper turnover of equipment, where applicable, will also be \nensured at the project\u2019s completion date. Collaborations with other national statistical systems in \nthe region and selected international organizations will be established in the course of TA \nimplementation, and individual resource persons will be engaged from them to source expertise \nfor training, facilitating workshops, and providing need-based technical support. Assignment per \nresource person will not exceed 10 working days. \n \n20.  Good  practices  and  lessons  learned  will  be  disseminated  through  ADB\u2019s  website, \nworkshops,  seminars,  conferences,  and  various  publications.  To  ensure  timely  delivery  of \noutputs, regular meetings with NIAs and consultants will be held to monitor progress and \ndiscuss possible problems or constraints that may be encountered. Further progress will be \nmonitored through draft reports from consultants and NIAs in participating countries.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Statistical Business Registers for Improved Information on Small, Medium-Sized, and Large \nEnterprises, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved information  At least two  Publications and  Demand for evidence-based \non small, medium- participating DMCs  websites of  policy making exists \nsized, and large  produce reliable and  participating national   \nenterprises and  accurate statistics on  statistical systems  \nreduction in response  small, medium-sized, \nburden of enterprises  and large enterprises \nin participating DMCs  on a regular basis \n   \nReduction by 10% in \nthe response burden \non enterprises \nimposed by national \nstatistical systems by \n2017 (baseline: 2013) \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nIncreased number of  Six SBRs newly  TA, consultant, and  Governments are committed \nSBRs established or  established or  review mission reports  to improving their national \nimproved in  improved by national    statistical systems  \nparticipating DMCs   statistical systems in  Workshop materials   \nparticipating DMCs   from participating  Risk \n  countries  Changes in government \n    regulations and policies \n  affect coordination and data \n  sharing among agencies  in \n  national statistical systems \nand other government \nagencies  \nOutputs        Assumptions \n1.
