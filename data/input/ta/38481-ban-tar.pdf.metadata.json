In  October  2003,  on  the  request  of  the  Government  of  Bangladesh,  a  technical \nassistance (TA) project, tentatively entitled Strengthening National Accounts II, was included in \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for Bangladesh \n(2004-2006).  In June 2005, the Government, through the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics \n(BBS), sent a proposal outlining the main challenges in improving national accounts. In August \n2005, ADB reinforced its commitment to continue strengthening BBS\u2019 capacity in monitoring the \nnational poverty reduction strategy (NPRS) and CSP implementation, and included the TA \nproject in its CSP for Bangladesh (2006-2010).1 \n \n2.  In August 2005, the Fact-Finding Mission visited Dhaka to hold extensive discussions \nand consultations on the proposed TA with relevant officials of BBS for the TA project, other \ngovernment  agencies,  and  development  partners.  At  the  end  of  the  Mission,  a  general \nunderstanding on the  TA objective, scope, financing, and implementation arrangements was \nreached, including the change of the title of the TA project to improving National Accounts, \nPrice, and Wage Statistics.2 The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In  December  2004,  the  Government  produced  its  NPRS,  Unlocking  the  Potential: \nNational  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction,  giving  a  number  of  indicators  for \nmonitoring and evaluating the strategy, including some macroeconomic indicators produced by \nBBS, such as gross domestic product (GDP), inflation rate, public and private investment, \nexport earning, and wage rate. \n \n4.  However,  the  existing  GDP  estimates  still  require  improvement,  especially  due  to \nundercoverage  and  outdated  technical  coefficients.3  The  estimates  of  public  and  private \ninvestment also need to be updated. Realizing that there are problems with the existing GDP \nestimates,4 early this year the Government formed two committees \u2014 the advisory committee5 \nand the executive committee6 \u2014 to improve national accounts statistics and advise BBS on \nshort-term indicators.7  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 2 August 2005. \n2  The change was made because there is a pressing need to monitor implementation of the NPRS. \n3 The weakest areas of statistics are construction and private services. Their annual estimates are in most cases \nbased on outdated and low reliability coefficients or simply extrapolated figures with the rates of growth of the past. \nImprovement of the gross domestic product (GDP) estimates is very important as they are also used for other \nNPRS indicators, such as expenditure on poverty reducing sectors as percentage of GDP. \n4  Critics, for instance the Center of Policy Dialogue, have expressed concerns about the wide discrepancy between \npreliminary and final estimates of GDP. \n5  Led by Prof. Wahiduddin Mahmud, with the following members:  the Bangladesh Bank Governor; the Planning \nCommission\u2019s representative; Prof. K. Saleh Ahmed, the Jahangirnagar University; the Director General (DG), the \nBangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS); Dr. G. Rabbani, former Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics \n(BBS) DG; and the current BBS DG. \n6  Led by the BBS DG, with members from the Planning Commission, Bangladesh Bank, National Board of Revenue, \nBIDS, some universities\u2019 representatives, and the BBS Director of National Accounts Wing.  \n7  Since then the executive committee has met three times and recently four subcommittees (on prices, agriculture, \nindustry, and services) were formed. They were expected to provide recommendations by September 2005. ", "2 \n5.  A previous TA8 concentrated on quarterly national accounts (QNA). It produced the \nHandbook on Sources and Methods of Quarterly Series of the Bangladesh System of National \nAccounts and Pilot Compilation of Quarterly GDP of Bangladesh and trained the BBS key staff \non QNA. The present TA will deal with improving the GDP estimate primarily through additional \ndata collection to cover new economic activities.  \n \n6.  Another important NPRS indicator is the poverty estimate. BBS has been producing \npoverty statistics regularly since 1981/1982 using both household expenditure9 and poverty \nmonitoring surveys.10 However, monitoring poverty situation over time using household surveys \nis expensive and the survey can only be undertaken at most once a year. Thus, information \nabout the condition of the poor within the year is unavailable. Furthermore, the existing poverty \nstatistics  provide  a  medium-term  trend  of  changes  in  welfare  without  revealing  short-term \nintertemporal changes that have a profound impact on the ability of low-income households to \nimprove their well-being. Changes in real wages or income of the working poor,11 such as \nrickshaw drivers, barbers, and household maids, can be observed more regularly on a monthly \nor quarterly basis and these changes could be used as proxy indicators of poverty trends over \ntime.   \n \n7.  Although BBS has been collecting wage data in some economic sectors,12 the data have \nnot been systematically documented and fully utilized. They also need to be expanded to \ninclude various occupations of the working poor.  Price data also need to be examined. The \nexisting consumer and producer price indexes (CPI and PPI) have lost their relevance because \nthey have outdated base year and weights;13 thus they cannot accurately reflect actual recent \nprice increases. While BBS has been producing inflation rates, it has not explicitly computed a \nCPI for the poor. BBS reports wage and price statistics monthly or quarterly to the government; \nthe reports\u2019 content can be made poverty relevant. BBS does not have as yet the capacity to \nproduce a poverty proxy indicator to track short-term changes of the welfare of the poor. \n \n8.  In  addition to  quality  and  relevance,  the  timeliness  of  statistical  information  is very \nimportant. The 1997 financial crisis in some Asian countries and increased globalization have \nindicated the need to monitor the performance of an economy in more timely fashion. Annual \nfigures  are  no  longer  sufficient  to  the  policy  makers;  more  frequent  releases  of  some \nmacroeconomic  indicators  are  required.  However,  unlike  indicators  on  the  monetary  and \nfinancial  sector,  such  as  government  expenditures,  inflation  rates,  and  exchange  rates, \nindicators on the real sector are not yet available regularly within a year. These indicators, such \nas  GDP  estimates,  electricity  usage,  and  sales  volume  of  selected  large  manufacturing \nestablishments,  which  are  required  to  assess  the  performance  of  the  real  sector  of  the \neconomy, need to be constructed and presented more regularly (e.g., quarterly).  \n                                                 \n8  ADB, 2000, Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Strengthening the National Accounts \nand Poverty Monitoring System, Manila. However, this TA did not deal with a poverty monitoring system as BBS \nhas had capability in producing poverty statistics. \n9  It was carried out in 1981/1982, 1983/1984, 1985/1986, 1988/1989, 1991/1992, and 2000. The World Bank has \nbeen assisting BBS in the household survey activity. \n10 The poverty monitoring household survey started in 1994. It was carried out annually until 1999, but it stopped due \nto resource constraint. The most recent survey was in 2004. \n11  Indonesia\u2019s Central Board of Statistics, for instance, has collected such information for a number of years, and \nrecently it has been providing monthly high-level (cabinet) meetings with trends and highlights of this \u201dworking \npoor,\u201d as part of a poverty monitoring system. \n12 For instance, wage rate of agricultural day laborers, selected industries (e.g., textiles and engineering) workers, \nand construction workers. \n13 E.g., the CPI for industrial workers is based on the 1969/1970 base year while that for the rural population is based \non the 1973/1974 base year. ", "3 \n \n9.  The availability of the noted short-term economic indicators will allow policy makers to \nmonitor short-term changes and fluctuation in the economy and will enable them to act timely \nand appropriately.14 Supplying such indicators to policy makers will increase their appreciation \nof statistics as important for informed decision-making, which, in turn, will increase data demand \nand resources for statistical activities. \n \n10.  In short, while there is a need to monitor the implementation of NPRS and CSP, BBS \ndoes  not  yet  have  sufficient  capability  to  produce  timely,  quality,  and  relevant  NRPS \nmacroeconomic  indicators,  such  as  national  accounts,  and  price  and  wage  statistics.  This \nstatistical capacity building TA to BBS is part of ADB\u2019s commitment as stated in its CSP for \nBangladesh (2006-2010). It is also very timely as it can support the two committees on national \naccounts and short-term macroeconomic indicators (para. 4). BBS, as a major producer of \nNPRS indicators, needs to provide users with the indicators, either directly through its various \nprimary  data  collection  system  or  indirectly  through  secondary  information  from  other  line \nministries. To fulfill this task and to implement its role as a national statistics office, BBS needs \nto improve its statistical capability.15  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA aims at improving  the monitoring of the implementation of NPRS and CSP by \nproviding a regular flow of NPRS macroeconomic indicators. It will produce a number of outputs, \nmainly the following six items (i) short-term macroeconomic indicators, (ii) estimate of poverty \nproxy indicators for the working poor, (iii) improved estimates of national accounts, (iv) improved \nprice statistics, (v) improved wage statistics, and (vi) stronger BBS\u2019 statistical capability. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The outputs will be obtained through a combination of consulting services; training \ncourses and study visit; provision of computing equipment; and support for data collection, \nprocessing,  analysis,  and  dissemination.  Key  activities  will  be  (i)  production  of  short-term \neconomic  indicators,  (ii)  production  of  poverty  proxy  indicators,  (iii)  national  accounts \nimprovement, (iv) price statistics improvement, (v) wage statistics improvement, (vi) institutional \ncapacity strengthening. \n \n1.  Production of Short-Term Economic Indicators \n \n13.  This component will (i) select 10-15 short-term economic indicators, (ii) identify data \nsources, (iii) train BBS staff in deriving the indicators, (iv) design and implement new data \ncollection procedures, and (v) present the indicators. \n                                                 \n14 The Bangladesh Bank, one of the main users of BBS data, has indicated its high demand for such indicators and \nexpressed its willingness to cooperate with BBS. ADB and the World Bank also clearly stated the pressing need for \nshort-term real sector indicators. \n15 Including its statistical management and authority. Unlike other countries in the region, Bangladesh\u2019s National \nStatistical System still does not have a comprehensive statistics law, providing clear responsibilities through \ndesignated statistics. The existing acts, namely the 1972 Census Order, the 1942 Industrial Statistical Act, and the \nrules of business of the government are not sufficient to enable BBS to function as a national statistics office. This \ncondition makes it difficult for BBS to function and leads to both duplication of statistics (i.e., inefficient statistical \nsystem) and unavailability of certain statistics. \n ", "4 \n2.  Production of Poverty Proxy Indicator \n \n14.  This component will (i) identify the working poor to be monitored, (ii) review and then \nrecommend the wage and price data to be used for monitoring, (iii) design the data collection \nprocedures and instruments, (iv) do field activity, (v) process data and derive the indicators, and \n(vi) present the indicators. The activity will be carried out in two major cities, Dhaka and \nChittagong, and in some selected rural areas. \n \n3.  National Accounts Improvement \n \n15.  This component will (i) support the activities of the two committees on national accounts \nand short-term indicators, (ii) computerize the compilation of the system of national accounts, \n(iii) update some technical coefficients, (iv) apply the supply and use table, and (v) reduce some \ndata gaps. \n \n4.  Price Statistics Improvement  \n \n16.  This component will (i) review the existing price surveys and price indexes (such as CPI, \nthe quantum index of industrial production, and PPI); (ii) recommend some improvements, \nincluding updating of the base year; (iii) implement the recommendations; and (iv) produce and \npresent improved price statistics. \n \n  5.  Wage Statistics Improvement  \n \n17.  This  component  will  (i)  review  existing  wage  statistics,;  (ii)  recommend  some \nimprovements, (iii) implement the recommendations, and (iv) produce and present improved \nwage statistics. \n \n6.  Institutional Capacity Strengthening \n \n18.  This component will (i) train the BBS staff; (ii) conduct a study visit; (iii) strengthen \ncomputing capacity; and (iv) produce a statistics law, including a list of designated statistics and \nan advance-release calendar. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $500,000 equivalent, of which $168,000 is in \nforeign exchange and $332,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $232,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis through \nthe TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost \nequivalent of $100,000 as counterpart contribution in the form of counterpart staff, office, local \ntransport, survey cost, and administration and support (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years beginning in mid-January 2006 and ending by \nDecember 2008. BBS will be the Executing Agency. The Development Indicators and Policy \nResearch Division (ERDI) of ADB will administer the TA. ERDI will monitor and review TA \nprogress through regular (including e-mail) communication with BBS and the consultants, BBS \nprogress reports, consultants\u2019 reports, and review missions. The Government will appoint a TA ", "5 \nproject director who will be responsible for coordinating with ERDI, as well as for day-today \nproject implementation, supervision of consultants\u2019 work, review of the consultants\u2019 report, and \nthe preparation of the quarterly progress report to ADB. \n \n21.  The TA will finance consulting services of 19 person-months: 4 international and 15 \ndomestic. The consultants will be recruited individually, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nThe consultants will submit reports within 2 weeks after completing their assignment. The terms \nof reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA will finance a number of workshops, \na study visit, in-country training courses, and apprenticeship program. \n \n22.  The  Government  will  provide  the  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  administrative  and \ntechnical support, and local expenses, such as local transportation for counterpart staff and \ninternational  consultants.  BBS  will  arrange  all  the  surveys,  workshops,  and  training  in \nBangladesh.  The  participants  in  the  workshops/study  visit/in-country  training/apprenticeship \nprovided under the TA will be nominated by BBS and approved by both the Government and \nADB. ADB and BBS will arrange the study visit and apprenticeship program.16 The Government \nwill take the necessary steps to ensure that the staff who undergo the training/apprenticeship \ncontinue to work for BBS. BBS will submit written progress reports highlighting measurable \noutputs and recommendations for future action to ADB every quarter from TA inception, and a \ncompletion report within 3 months after completion of all TA activities. \n \n23.  Computers, training equipment, and other durable equipment will be purchased with the \nTA proceeds in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. All equipment will be turned \nover to BBS upon completion of the TA. The TA will also finance the pilot survey and actual \nsurvey  activities  (collecting  data  from  primary  sources),  including  training  supervisors  and \nenumerators, preparing and printing survey instruments, field operation, data validation, data \nprocessing  and  analysis,  and  publication.  Collecting  data  from  secondary  sources \n(administrative data) will also be supported to complement information obtained from primary \nsources. The TA outputs will be presented in some workshops and published by BBS. \n \n24.  The  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  to  and  liquidated  by  BBS  in  accordance  with  the \nprocedures and requirements of ADB\u2019s advance payment facility. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bangladesh for Improving National Accounts, Price, and Wage Statistics, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n16 The overseas study visit is required as the BBS and Ministry of Planning high-level management should learn \nabout the existing statistical laws and management of statistical activities in other statistical systems in the region. \nThe 1-month apprenticeship or on-the-job training for technical staff will be held in one or two national statistics \noffices in the region, as the technical staff have to really learn in practice how to produce the much-needed \nstatistics.  These  two  activities  were  planned  in  the  previous  TA,  but  they  were  not  implemented  due  to \nadministrative reasons and time constraints.  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nEffective monitoring  MOP submits  MOP\u2019s reports  Government uses \nof the implementation  monitoring reports on  NPRS macro-economic \nof NPRS and CSP  regular basis  indicators to monitor \nthe implementation of \nNPRS and CSP \nOutcome      Assumption \nRegular flow of  Timely and regular  BBS publications (such as  The Government is \nNPRS macro- availability of short- Monthly Statistical Bulletin,  committed to allocate \neconomic indicators  term macro- Statistical Year Book,  sufficient resources. \neconomic indicators  National Accounts \nand poverty proxy  Statistics, Wage Rates of \nindicators, and  Selected Industries \nimproved national  Workers, and Consumer \naccounts, and price  Price Index and Average \nand wage statistics  Retail Prices of Selected \nCommodities in Dhaka) \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
