INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will complement efforts of the \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to build the capacity \nof their cities to become more livable through innovative and integrated solutions. Specifically, the \nTA  will  help  cities  in  DMCs  with  project  identification  and  prioritization,  conceptualization, \ndevelopment, and the conducting of project preparatory studies (PPSs) to develop feasible, \ngender-responsive, inclusive, and economically viable investments. The TA will also support cities \nin securing downstream financing of PPSs by governments, development partners, commercial \nbanks, the private sector, and other potential financing organizations. \n \n2.  The TA builds on the experience of the implementation of the Cities Development Initiative \nfor Asia (CDIA), which was established by ADB and the Government of Germany in 2007 to \nimprove the lives of 1.6 billion people in Asia and the Pacific by working closely with cities in the \nregion to address infrastructure development and financing gaps.1 Since its inception, CDIA has \nhelped cities develop their project design and development capacity and facilitated downstream \nfinancing. As of December 2019, the program had initiated 103 PPSs in 111 cities in 20 countries \nin Asia, completed 94 PPSs, and mobilized $11.2 billion in financing for 78 PPSs.2 Although the \nCDIA program has proven its success over the past 13 years, there is still growing demand from \ncities for project preparatory support to develop new investments that can help them respond to \ngrowing urbanization and new challenges like  the  coronavirus disease (COVID-19). \n \n3.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and the Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for \nPriority 4: Making Cities More Livable, 2019\u20132024, which aims to improve the coverage, quality, \nefficiency, and reliability of services in urban areas; strengthen urban planning and financial \nsustainability of cities; and improve the urban environment, climate resilience, and disaster risk \nmanagement of cities.3 The TA is also aligned with CDIA Strategy 2018\u20132022,4 and is included \nin the 2020 Management-approved, results-based work plan of the Sustainable Development and \nClimate Change Department.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Continuing rapid urbanization in Asia and the Pacific. Urbanization, especially in \ndeveloping countries, is one of the most significant global trends that will define development \noutlooks. The urban population in Asia and the Pacific increased from about 20% of the region\u2019s \npopulation in the 1950s to about 48% in 2018, and is projected to reach about 55% or 2.5 billion \npeople in 2030.6 Rural\u2013urban migration has become a significant contributing factor to the region\u2019s \n \n1  Since 2007, CDIA\u2019s main areas of work have been (i) providing project preparatory support to cities to prepare \nsustainable and bankable infrastructure projects, (ii) linking proposed projects with funding sources, and (iii) building \ncapacity to develop and implement high-priority investments. ADB implemented CDIA activities through two previous \nTA projects: ADB. Regional: Managing the Cities in Asia; and ADB. Regional: Supporting the Cities Development \nInitiative for Asia. More details are available in CDIA. \n2  For example, in 2019, CDIA completed nine PPSs. More details are available in CDIA. \n3  ADB. 2018.

World Urbanization Prospects: \nThe 2018 Revision. New York. \n ", "2 \nurbanization, with an estimated 120,000 people migrating into cities each day in 2015.7 As of 2015 \ncities contribute to about 80% of the region\u2019s gross domestic product and have high potential to \nact  as  a  catalyst  for  economic  development.  Urbanization  is  often  linked  to  improved \nsocioeconomic opportunities and better living conditions.8 However, cities face various challenges \nsuch as growing infrastructure deficits, increasing social inequality, and rising environmental \nstress. \n \n5.  Insufficient and inefficient urban services and huge investment needs. Many cities \nin the region still grapple with deficient infrastructure and inadequate urban services to address \npresent and emerging demands. About 523 million people across Asia and the Pacific live in \ninformal urban settlements with poor services in 2015, and about 260 million people in urban and \nrural areas have no access to safe drinking water, and about 1.2 billion people in urban and rural \nareas lack basic sanitation in 2019.9 Further, 80% of the wastewater generated by cities is \ndischarged into water bodies without primary treatment as of 2016, and the region is expected to \ngenerate 1.8 billion tons of waste per year by 2025.10 To improve infrastructure and urban \nservices, cities need an integrated multisector approach that considers climate resilience and \nmitigation, disaster risk management, gender and social development, inclusive growth, balanced \ndevelopment of open spaces, and the preservation of cultural and heritage sites. The region \nrequired $750 billion in investments per year between 2010 and 2020 to bridge the infrastructure \ngap, but 2017 estimates more than doubled that requirement to $1.7 trillion per year until 2030.11 \n \n6.  Cities\u2019 weak capacity affecting service delivery. Cities in DMCs need to build adequate \ninstitutional capacity to plan, implement, and operate urban services to address their challenges. \nDMCs have well recognized and appreciated CDIA support for building capacity in their cities. \nCDIA has adopted a focused capacity development approach where capacity building support is \nfully integrated into its project preparatory support activities.12 Despite increasing decentralization, \ncities and urban regions frequently face governance challenges, including weak institutional \nstructures, overlapping legal and regulatory frameworks, lack of coordination and citizen-centric \napproaches  in  governance  processes  and  operations,  blurred  administrative  boundaries, \ncorruption, poor public services, inefficient infrastructure operation and maintenance programs, \nlack of own-source revenue, and capacity constraints. CDIA has supported capacity development \nfor cities through activities that include (i) knowledge generation and documentation, (ii) training \nprograms and knowledge sharing sessions on critical areas of sustainable urban development, \nand (iii) knowledge exchange sessions on key innovations and international best practices among \nproject cities. CDIA can help mobilize citizens (with an emphasis on marginalized groups), \npartners, and other stakeholders to plan, design, and implement inclusive governance systems \nfor people-centered and needs-based livable city solutions. CDIA supports partnerships with \nnational project development facilities for providing capacity development support on project \npreparation.13 \n \n7  International Organization for Migration. 2015.

Poor  project  designs  and  inadequate  financial  sustainability  of  services.  The \nmobilization of urban infrastructure finance is often challenged by the lack of properly designed \nand ready-to-implement viable projects. Moreover, disasters and pandemics, such as the COVID-\n19, divert cities\u2019 scarce resources from planned investments. Cities also need to provide more \nresources for health care, disaster management, and social protection measures during such \ncrises. While CDIA has made substantial contributions to the design and development of projects, \nthere is still substantial unmet demand for adequate urban infrastructure and services. Such \nchallenges  are  further  compounded  by  an  absence  of  creditworthy  entities,  opaque  credit \nstructures,  insufficient  own-source  revenues,  and  poor  cost-recovery  mechanisms  that  are \naggravated by the reluctance of governments and urban agencies to levy user charges. Key local \nrevenue sources, such as property taxes, publicly owned assets, and licenses, remain underused \nor undeveloped even as many DMCs face debt limits and other financial constraints. Robust \nfinancial management systems and fundamental tools, such as the cadastral systems, property \nregistry,  utility  metering  systems,  tariff  structures,  and  asset  management,  need  to  be \nstrengthened. \n \n8.  Alternative means of financing planned investments. Many local governments are still \nvery dependent on central government transfers, including funds from development partners, as \na source of revenue.14 CDIA\u2019s experience illustrates that cities often face challenges in accessing \nalternate sources of financing because they lack an enabling local environment and appropriate \npolicies.15  Addressing  these  constraints  would  enable  cities to  access alternative  financing \nsources and tools, such as public\u2013private partnerships, targeted levies, land value capture, pool \nfinancing, asset valuation, and climate financing. \n \n9.  Lessons. One important lesson from the CDIA experience is that downstream financing \nof PPSs entails early identification of and close coordination with potential financiers. Accordingly, \nthe TA will closely engage with potential financiers during the preparation and conduct of PPSs.16 \nCDIA has also incorporated in its implementation plans lessons on identifying and addressing \ntechnical, organizational, and human capacity gaps that diminish livability in cities. The TA will \nalso build systems for CDIA to continue to engage with selected cities over a longer period of \nabout two to three years to incorporate the lessons learned to build meaningful partnerships. \n \n10.  Cities  Development  Initiative  for  Asia  value  addition.  CDIA  introduced  several \ninnovative approaches, such as leveraging the expertise and technology of knowledge partners \nto inform PPSs and ADB investment projects. CDIA also covers a wide range of cross-sector and \nthematic  objectives,  such  as  poverty  alleviation,  gender  and  inclusion,  economic  growth, \nenvironmental sustainability, climate resilience and mitigation, and governance. Building on these \nexperiences, the TA\u2019s scope, outcome, and outputs reflect the lessons learned. CDIA will support \nSustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 on making cities and communities inclusive, safe, \nresilient, and sustainable; SDG 1.4 on ensuring equal access to basic services for all; and SDG \n \nproject preparation; and (iii) the Ministry of Public Works and Transport of Cambodia, which worked with CDIA on \nclimate vulnerability and adaptation assessment for three towns. \n14 Central government transfers account for 90% of the revenue of cities in India and Indonesia, about 70% of the \nrevenue of cities in the Philippines, and about 40% of the revenue of cities in advanced economies such as Japan \nand the Republic of Korea.

CDIA\u2019s approach is to work directly with cities to build their capacity and help them \nbecome more livable in keeping with ADB\u2019s and other development partners\u2019 goals and priorities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: livability in cities in DMCs improved.17 The TA \nwill have the following outcome: financing for inclusive and gender-responsive investments in \ncities in DMCs increased.18 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output  1:  Project  preparatory  studies  for  inclusive  and  gender-responsive \ndevelopment of cities completed. Given the growing interest from DMC cities, CDIA will \ncontinue to support the identification, prioritization, conceptualization, development, and conduct \nof PPSs for cities in close coordination with key national ministries to develop feasible, gender-\nresponsive, and economically viable investments. CDIA will also support cities on downstream \nfinancing  of  PPSs  by  cities,  central  and  provincial  governments,  development  partners, \ncommercial banks, and the private sector. CDIA will support PPSs that (i) provide integrated and \ninnovative solutions; (ii) include pro-poor, socially inclusive, and gender-responsive approaches; \n(iii)  support  green  development,  environmental  sustainability,  and  climate  resilience  and \nmitigation; (iv) help cities become competitive and investible; and (v) build cities\u2019 resilience to \ndisasters and public health risks, such as COVID-19. Support under each PPS includes (i) the \nvalidation of key investments based on the city\u2019s development priorities; (ii) project due diligence, \nincluding technical assessment; economic and financial analysis; social, poverty, and gender \nimpact  assessment;  climate  and  disaster  risk  assessment;  and  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards; and (iii) the preparation of conceptual engineering designs based on the preferred \ntechnical  options.  Where  appropriate,  the  proposed  investments  will  also  be  assessed  for \nbankability  in  terms  of their  potential  for  public\u2013private  partnership  as  a  means  of  project \nimplementation.  The  PPSs  will  be  implemented  in  close  coordination  with  governments, \ndevelopment  partners  (including  CDIA  financing  partners),  civil  society  (including  women\u2019s \norganizations and youth groups), and other relevant stakeholders. \n \n13.  Output 2: Opportunities for financing investments in cities improved. The TA will \nsupport cities in implementing good practices and innovative approaches for mobilizing financing \nfor investments. Specifically, this will include (i) supporting cities in preparing municipal financing \nframeworks based on their local context, strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, including \nidentifying tools to help strengthen cities\u2019 financial resource generation capacity using internal and \nexternal sources; (ii) providing mentorship and guidance on operationalizing the action plan to \nhelp cities mobilize commercial or blended financing options for their investments, including CDIA-\nsupported PPSs; and (iii) supporting cities in identifying and mobilizing alternative and innovative \nsources of financing, such as land value capture, municipal bonds, asset valuation, and public\u2013\nprivate partnerships. \n \n14.  Output  3:  Knowledge  and  capacity  of  select  cities  on  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment enhanced. The TA will support cities in developing knowledge solutions and \nbuilding capacity. To ensure effective implementation and alignment between local and national \n \n17 ADB. 2019. Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 4: Making Cities More Livable, 2019\u20132024. Manila. \n18 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "5 \ndevelopment priorities, CDIA will involve key national ministries through policy dialogue and \nknowledge generation and dissemination. Specifically, the scope will include support for cities to \n(i) prepare and implement capacity building plans to enhance their knowledge and capacity and \nimprove their governance; (ii) enhance operational and financial sustainability through improved \noperations and maintenance systems, benchmarking, asset management planning, and revenue \nrealization; (iii) undertake policy, regulatory, and legal reforms for making cities more livable; (iv) \nuse information and communication technology to improve services, enhance competitiveness, \nand  develop  human  capital;  and  (v)  enable  citizen  participation,  including  youths,  in  city \ngovernance processes. The TA will support cities in learning lessons and good practices from the \nimplementation  of  past  CDIA  PPSs  and  other  impactful  initiatives  of  various  development \npartners, including ADB; and sharing knowledge through various methods, such as city-to-city \nlearning  visits  and  events,  networking,  and  partnerships  with  national  and  international \norganizations. CDIA will also build the capacity of project preparation facilities.19 The TA will \nsupport the preparation of knowledge products in the form of videos, technical studies, briefs, \nbrochures, and blogs that will be disseminated in print, electronic, and online media.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $4.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nCDIA Trust Fund20 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.21 \nADB  has  regularly  consulted  the  financing  partners  of  the  CDIA  Trust  Fund  and  other \nstakeholders, and anticipates more funds to be made available during the TA\u2019s implementation to \nfulfill the agreed objectives. Additional financing for the TA will be processed to access additional \nfunds made available to the TA by ADB, various trust funds, and other financing partners, as \nappropriate. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. Eligible costs under the CDIA \nTrust Fund include operational expenses in the form of consulting services, equipment, training \nevents, workshops and conferences, and other TA-related activities. The TA will not use the funds \nfor civil works, procurement of large-scale equipment, and permanent staffing costs. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. The Urban Sector Group under the Sustainable Development \nand Climate Change Department will handle TA administration and supervision. ADB will engage \nfirms and individual consultants and carry out procurement, including advance contracting, \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nproject administration instructions and/or staff instructions. CDIA will work on a demand-driven \napproach  with  requests  for  support  coming  directly  from  cities  endorsed  by  national  and \nsubnational governments and downstream funding agencies.
