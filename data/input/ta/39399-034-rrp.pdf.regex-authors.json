I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Nepal for the additional financing of the South Asia Tourism Infrastructure Development \nProject.1 The report also describes proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nAsian Clean Energy Fund (ACEF) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility,2 for \nthe additional financing of the South Asia Tourism Infrastructure Development Project, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the administration of the grant for the additional financing.  \n \n2.  The additional financing will support restructuring of the Nepal portion of the project to \nmeet cost overrun as a result of price escalation and a change in scope of the Gautam Buddha \nAirport (GBA) from the originally designed regional international airport to a full international \nairport  and  safety  improvements  to  provide  unconstrained  air  connectivity  for  international \ntourists visiting the world heritage site at Lumbini. This is considered critical to achieving the \nobjective of the original project, which was to develop Lumbini, the birth place of Lord Buddha, \nas an attractive cultural tourism destination and to upgrade GBA to link it with international \ntourist  circuits  in  South  Asia.    Expanding  the project  scope\u2014from  an  upgrade  to regional \ninternational airport standard to a full international standard\u2014will also enable GBA to serve as \nan alternate and backup international air transport point for Nepal in the event that poor weather \nconditions or a natural calamity shuts down Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA). TIA currently \nis the only airport in the country that can accommodate full-size aircrafts. Restructuring and \ncompleting the delayed project is expected to provide benefits that will outweigh the costs, and \nis preferred over downsizing or cancelling it by ADB as the government has accorded it a high \npriority.    \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The South Asia Tourism Infrastructure Development Project was approved by the Board \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 16 November 2009 to develop and improve tourism-\nrelated infrastructure in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal.3 It aimed to support a future pattern of \ntourism in South Asia and envisioned the development of international circuits of interlinked \nnature and cultural tourism sites across the region. The project\u2019s intended impact was the \nestablishment of an integrated pattern for the future growth of tourism in South Asia that would \nenhance the sector\u2019s contribution to sustainable and inclusive economic growth.   \n \n4.  The intended outcome in Nepal was the further development of Lumbini as a tourism \ndestination, building on its natural attraction for the world\u2019s Buddhists and many other cultural \ntourists and on its inclusion on the World Heritage List of the United Nations Educational, \nScientific and Cultural Organization.4 The key output designed to achieve this outcome was the \nupgrading  of  GBA,  which  is  20  kilometers  east  of  Lumbini  and  could  accommodate  only \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Established by the Government of Japan. \n3  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans, Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant, and Administration of Loan to the People's Republic of Bangladesh, India, and Nepal: \nSouth Asia Tourism Infrastructure Development Project. Manila (ADF Loan 2580 $12 million to Bangladesh; OCR \nLoan 2578 $20 million to India; and ADF Loan 2579 $12.75 million and Grant 0179 $12.75 million to Nepal). \n4  The World Heritage List includes 981 sites that are considered to form part of humankind\u2019s cultural and natural \nheritage and to have outstanding universal value. ", "2 \ndomestic flights, so that it could provide direct air connectivity  to Lumbini for  international \ntourists currently travelling via TIA. Due to the project\u2019s delay, the lack of direct international air \nlink continues to keep tourism growth in the Lumbini area from reaching its full potential. The \nrunway and apron at GBA do not meet the standards for international flights by even medium-\nsized jet aircrafts, and the airport also lacks facilities for processing international passengers.5 In \n2012, most of the 795,800 recorded visitors to Lumbini traveled by road from points in Nepal \nand from India. International visitors who travel by air must be routed through TIA to connect \nfrom international flights to domestic flights to GBA.6 \n \n5.  Upgrading  GBA  for  access  by  full-size  international  aircraft  will  enable  airlines  to \nestablish direct air services from countries that generate the majority of visitors to Lumbini. \nCurrently, in order of visitor numbers, people from India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Myanmar \nhave visited Lumbini. The expansion could also increase tourism from more distant sources, \nsuch as the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.7 Direct international \nair routes to GBA could also attract foreign tourists who visit three other cultural sites in India on \nwhat is called Footsteps of Lord Buddha tourist circuits but who now must travel by road or a \nroundabout  air  route  through  TIA.8 With  the  GBA  upgrade,  annual  international  annual \npassenger traffic through GBA is forecast to reach 759,639 in 2030, including 281,806 visitors to \nLumbini.9 Although this was not considered in the original project design, the government now \nsees GBA upgrade as critically needed since it will provide Nepal with a second international air \naccess point in an emergency and prepare for the eventual overloading of capacity at TIA (para. \n 10\n2).  The original project also included steps to enhance Lumbini as a tourist destination by \nimproving the environment and services for visitors, fostering participation by local communities \nin livelihood opportunities tourism growth will offer, and strengthening the project management \ncapacity of related government agencies.11 These activities will be completed and augmented \nalongside the enhanced GBA upgrade under the proposed additional financing (para. 8).  \n \n6.  The original financing agreement for the Nepal portion of the project provided a loan and \na grant from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, each equivalent to $12.75 million. It was signed \non 25 May 2010 and declared effective on 3 September 2010. In addition, the OPEC Fund for \nInternational Development agreed to cofinance the project through a loan of $15.0 million that \nwas to be administered by ADB but has not yet been disbursed due to project delay.  \n \n7.  The  costs  of  upgrading  GBA  have  risen  38%  over  the  original  project  appraisal \nestimates in 2008 mainly due to price escalation during the project delay for key construction \nmaterials and equipment. Based on the detailed engineering design in 2013, the base cost for \n                                                \n5  The originally designed upgrade was to enable access to GBA by medium-size aircrafts such as Boeing 757 and \nAirbus 300 designated as Code 2 by the International Civil Aviation Organization.   \n6  Travelers from within Nepal make up 68% of visitors to Lumbini. The most numerous foreign visitors are from India \n(120,584 in 2012). Many visitors from India now travel by air to points near Nepal, such as Kushinagar, from which \nthey are then transported by tour buses the 150 kilometers to Lumbini.    \n7  International tourism is growing rapidly in Lumbini. The number of foreign tourists excluding those from India rose \nfrom 39,800 in 2005 to 136,000 in 2012, or at an annual growth rate of 19%. The main countries of origin in 2012 \nwere India (47.0%), Sri Lanka (20.5%), Thailand (11.1%), and Myanmar (6.9%). Others included the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (3.4%), the Republic of Korea (2.0%), Viet Nam (1.4%), the Netherlands (0.8%), and Japan \n(0.7%).    \n8  The Footsteps of Lord Buddha circuit consists of Lumbin in Nepal, and Bodhgaya, Sarnath, and Kushinagar in \nIndia. \n9  In 2012, the level of aircraft activity at GBA amounted to 4,172 annual aircraft movements, or an average of 5 \nflights per day, which carried a total of almost 122,000 annual domestic passengers. \n10 TIA is in a high-risk zone to a major earthquake and vulnerable to liquefaction. It has also reached runway capacity \nsaturation during daylight hours and is expected to be fully congested in 2021.   \n11 The related government agencies are the Lumbini Development Trust and the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. \n ", "3 \nthe originally planned GBA upgrade, excluding contingency, had increased from $32.4 million in \nmid-2008 prices to about $44.6 million in mid-2012. The expanded scope of the upgrade will \nimprove  safety  and  allow  the  use  of  larger  international  aircrafts  and  unconstrained  traffic \ngrowth at the airport. The scaling up of the original upgrade design will add 400 meter length to \nthe runway and 300 meter length to the taxiway, overlay the existing 1,500 meter runway for \nuse as a parallel taxiway, construct 15,169 square meter terminal building, improve drainage \nsystem, and install more advanced navigational aids, equipment and airport lighting for air \nsafety.12 These are estimated to require additional 74% of the updated cost for the original \nscope, or 140% of the original project estimate in 2008.13 \n   \n8.  The  additional  financing  will  restructure  the  project  and  improve  implementation  as \ndesign and supervision consultant has been recruited, and procurement of civil work to up-scale \nGBA upgrading from the original design has been commenced. Past performance and expected \nimprovements are summarized below: \n \n(i)  Results  against  expected  outputs. A bid document for the main output of \nupgrading GBA has been completed. The bidding process for the contract has \nbegun, with the award contingent upon ADB approval of the additional financing. \nA contractor has been selected to upgrade water supply and sanitation and build \na new visitor center and information displays, car parks, and bus stops for the \nsecond output\u2014improving the tourism destination environment and services in \nLumbini. A consultant has been mobilized for the third output\u2014enhance capacity, \nincrease community participation, and improve project management.  \n(ii)  Implementation progress. As of January 2014, with 55% of the financing period \nelapsed, the cumulative contract award was $3.95 million (15.5% of available \nloan and grant proceeds) and cumulative disbursement was $1.92 million (7.5%). \nProcurement of design, supervision and project management consultants and \nrelated disbursements, and contract award for construction of information center \nin Lumbini have contributed the progress. Upon award of the main contract for \nupgrading  GBA,  overall  progress  on  implementation  is  expected  to  improve \nsubstantially. \n(iii)  Safeguard  compliance.  Overall,  the  current  project  is  in  compliance  with \nspecific assurances and environmental and social covenants stipulated in the \nfinancing agreement. \n(iv)  Management  of  risks.  The  main  risk  associated  with  implementation \narrangement has been mitigated satisfactorily, because the project coordination \nunit and project management and implementation units are well established and \nhave adequate full-time staffing. The consultant for design and supervision has \nbeen mobilized and is performing satisfactorily.  \n(v)  Project performance rating. The current project performance is rated on track.14 \nThe restructuring of the project will expedite the award of the main contract for \nupgrading GBA, and the improved disbursement will help project performance \nstay on track. \n                                                \n12 GBA needs the increased capacity to handle full-size, wide-body passenger airlines currently serving TIA. These \ninclude Code E aircrafts designated by the International Civil Aviation Organization such as Boeing 777 and Airbus \nA330. The design under the original project to use an existing unfinished concrete frame for the international \nterminal was found to be technically unfeasible.  \n13  The base cost for upgrading of GBA, excluding contingency, was estimated $32.4 million at appraisal period (mid-\n2008 prices), and updated in mid-2012 prices to cost about $44.6 million.  \n14  A project with a total rating score of 0.90 is on track. The five indicators have equal weight and relate to technical, \nprocurement, disbursement, financial management, and safeguards performance. \n ", "4 \n9.  ADB\u2019s administration of a grant to be provided by ACEF for the additional financing will \nsupport the introduction of clean public transport services (CPTS) using electric vehicles for \ntourists and local residents in Lumbini area. This will help reduce noise and pollution from poorly \nmaintained diesel and gasoline engine buses and add value to tourism experience.15 \n \n10.  Restructuring  and  completing  the  South  Asia  Tourism  Infrastructure  Development \nProject  offers  more  benefits  than  scaling  it  down  or  cancelling  it.16 The  restructuring  is \nnecessary  to  achieve  original  project\u2019s  intended  impact  and  outcome.  The  ACEF-financed \nCPTS  will  complement  the  project\u2019s  other  elements  and  enhance  its  overall  tourism \ndevelopment  objectives.  The  project  remains  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and \nfinancially sound. It is accorded high priority by the government and, consistent with priorities in \nthe civil aviation and tourism sectors outlined in the country\u2019s new Three Year Plan (2014-\n2016).17 The  proposed  additional  financing  supports  the  strategic  objectives  of  improving \nconnectivity, which is established in ADB's Nepal country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 and \nis included in the country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.18 The project meets eligibility \ncriteria for additional financing.19  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be the enhanced contribution of tourism to sustainable and inclusive \ngrowth in Nepal. The outcome will be nature and culture-based tourism destinations improved. \nAn outcome indicator will be added on tourists\u2019 public transport service usage, as a result of the \nACEF-financed CPTS.   \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  As in the original project, the outputs will be (i) enhanced connectivity to and from \nLumbini; (ii) improved community services and tourism facilities; and (iii) improved capacity in \ntourism  development  and  project  management.  As  a  result  of  the  scaling  up  of  the  GBA \ncomponent and the additional financing, the performance indicators for the first two outputs \nhave been revised. To achieve enhanced connectivity, GBA will be upgraded to operate as an \ninternational airport by 2017, rather than regional international airport in 2015. To improve the \ndestination, the scaled-up project will aim to put electric vehicle-based CPTS for tourists and \nlocal people in Lumbini into operation by 2017, in addition to improved destination environment \nand infrastructure. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n13.  The project is estimated to cost $97.2 million with the additional financing (Table 1). \n \n14.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR19,487,000 ($30.0 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \n                                                \n15 The CPTS has been designed in line with the Lumbini Master Plan prepared by the United Nations Educational, \nSocial and Cultural Organization. \n16  Scaling the project down to compensate for the cost overrun would produce an incomplete investment that fails to \nprovide safety and capacity improvements necessary to achieve the original development objectives.  \n17 Government of Nepal. 2013.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  The  project  will  use  proven  technology  and  is  technically  viable  and  sound.  The \nengineering design is based on site condition surveys and field investigations. The improvement \nworks are designed for optimal economy and construction efficiency in accord with applicable \ninternational design standards. Proven technology and standard materials that are compatible \nwith local conditions will be used in the construction. To enhance resilience in severe climatic \nevents and threats, hydrological hazards have been given local consideration. This includes an \nelevated design for the new runway and taxiway and provision for adequate drainage.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The economic assessment was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.23 The overall project, including the revisions under the additional \nfinancing for cost escalation and the expanded GBA and destination upgrades was examined. \nThe  economic  costs  considered  included  all  investment  costs  and  airport  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M).  The  estimated  economic  benefits  from  the  project  included  airport \nrevenues from aircraft services, passenger fees, and commercial activities at GBA; as well as \nthe benefits from increased tourist spending in Lumbini. The economic rate of return for the \nentire project with the additional financing was estimated to be 16.3%, which is higher than the \nopportunity cost of capital at 12% and indicates sufficient return and economic viability. The \nresults of sensitivity analysis, which produced returns of 13.5% - 16.3%, showed the project\u2019s \neconomic viability to be robust against downside risks. These included a 10% cost overrun, a \n10% decline in expected benefits, 10% higher O&M costs, and a delay in benefits of 1 year. \n \n21.  The financial analysis assessed whether revenues from the GBA improvements would \ncover the capital and operating costs of the upgrade. The estimated financial rate of return of \nthe overall project, including the additional financing, was estimated at 12.9%. The analysis was \nrestricted to the viability of GBA expansion. It used the most likely traffic forecast. The estimated \nfinancial rate of return is higher than the 4.6% weighted average cost of capital, indicating an \nadequate financial return. The return remained satisfactory and in a range of 10.8% - 12.9% \nunder sensitivity analysis. The scenarios tested included a 10% capital cost overrun, a 10% \nO&M cost overrun, a 10% decline in projected revenue from international visitors, and a 1-year \nimplementation delay. The financial sustainability assessment indicates that the project will \ngenerate sufficient liquid cash resources to meet its O&M costs and debt service obligations.   \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  Policy, legal, and institutional capacity. The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), \nthe implementing agency for GBA upgrading, was established by the Civil Aviation of Nepal Act, \n1996 as an autonomous state authority. It is supervised by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and \nCivil  Aviation  and  responsible  for  administering  and  regulating  civil  aviation  in  Nepal,  for \noperating both domestic and international airports, air traffic, and air navigation systems. The \nLumbini Development Trust (LDT), the implementing agency for tourist destination improvement \n                                                \n23 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \nactivities, was formed by the Lumbini Development Trust Act, 1985 to restore the Lumbini \nSacred Garden under the Lumbini Master Plan. The CAAN and the LDT have sufficient capacity, \npast experience, and institutional strength to implement the overall project. Both are being \nsupported under the original project by consultant services for detailed engineering design, \npreparation of bidding documents, and identifying and monitoring safeguards requirements.  \n \n23.  Financial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  the  CAAN  was \nupdated in 2013. The update covered funds-flow arrangements, governance, staffing, budgeting, \naccounting and financial reporting systems, internal control procedures, financial information \nsystems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. The CAAN will prepare a business \nplan, and design, install, and operate a financial management reporting system that will link \nGBA with the CAAN corporate financial management information system in Kathmandu. The \nCAAN and the LDT will maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing \nresources received and expenditures made for the project, ensuring an adequate audit trail. \nThey will have the annual financial statements audited by an auditor acceptable to ADB in \naccordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. \n \n24.  Operation  and  maintenance.  The  CAAN\u2019s  Airport  Operation  Directorate  provides \nadequate  maintenance  services  for  TIA  and  46  domestic  airports,  including  GBA.  The \ndirectorate comprises an aerodrome engineering department, an electromechanical department, \nand fire and rescue department. With only 85 staff in the CAAN, it relies on external local \ncontractors for several maintenance functions including some major activities for maintaining \nrunways, taxiways, and aprons. The CAAN plans to establish a separate airport operations \ndivision for the upgraded GBA with aerodrome, electromechanical, and fire and rescue units \nthat will have 10 fulltime maintenance workers. Additional or more specialized maintenance staff \nwill be seconded from the CAAN when required.   \n \n25.  Procurement  and  anticorruption.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). All consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). The government\u2019s procurement environment is improving. \nThe  government  is  strengthening  its  effort  to  fight  corruption.  Nepal  has  legislation  with \nanticorruption provisions in force, including the Promoting Market Competition Act, 2006; Right \nto  Information  Act,  2007;  Special  Court  Act,  2002  (amended  in  2007);  and  Anti-Money \nLaundering Act, 2008. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  the  CAAN  and  the  LDT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 20). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The poverty and social analysis has been updated, and the overall project is classified \nas some gender elements. Women and men will benefit from the project through improved \nopportunities for income generation and employment, directly by participating in the tourism \nactivities and indirectly through increased employment to be generated by the economic growth \nspurred by increased tourist inflows. The improved international connectivity through the GBA \nupgrade and the better tourist infrastructure and amenities in Lumbini will also result in general \nbenefits to local communities, including women. An increase in tourist arrivals and spending will \nexpand the market for local handicrafts and community-based tourism, which will also benefit \n ", "9 \nwomen. The CAAN will give special attention to constructing infrastructure in the GBA terminal \nthat caters to the needs of women, children, the disabled, and the elderly. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n1.  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n \n28.  Land acquisition and resettlement. No additional land or asset acquisition will be \nrequired under the additional financing. The additional financing is classified as category B for \ninvoluntary resettlement safeguards, since compensation has already been completed for 95% \nof those affected by the upgrading of GBA. After due diligence, the original resettlement plan \nwas revised, agreed to by the CAAN and disclosed on 18 November 2013. It addresses the \noutstanding activities from the original plan and is in line with Nepal\u2019s laws and policies and \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The original project was classified as category A. \nThe construction of the 3,000 meter GBA runway was expected to affect 590 agricultural and \nresidential land plots (92.89 hectares) belonging to 312 households, as well as some public and \nprivate  infrastructure.  During  detailed  design,  the  acquisition  of  some  residential  and \ncommercial  structures  was  avoided,  but  a  few  additional  land  plots  (4.38  hectares)  were \nrequired. The number of land plots to be acquired rose to 869. They belong to 389 households. \nCompensation  for  5%  of  these  plots  has  yet  to  be  settled.  They  are  associated  with  33 \nhouseholds  of  which  23  households  cultivating  27  community-owned  plots  are  eligible  for \ncompensation through skills development training. The remaining 16 plots are owned by 14 \nabsentee landowners, who are in contact with the CAAN regarding compensation. The CAAN \nwill  organize  income  generation  training,  give  priority  to  the  affected  people  in  income \nopportunities during construction and operation of GBA, and restore an affected village road as \npart of the civil works contract package during construction.  \n \n29.  Impact on indigenous peoples. No impact on indigenous peoples is envisaged, and \nthe  overall  project  is  classified  as  category C.  If  adverse  impacts  are  identified  during \nimplementation, the CAAN and the LDT will ensure that  a plan for indigenous peoples is \nprepared for ADB approval in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement before award of \nthe related civil works contract and implemented before relevant civil works begin.  \n \n2.  Environment \n \n30.  The  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B,  and  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) and an environmental management plan were prepared in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Community  consultations  were  carried  out  during \npreparation of the IEE. The IEE concluded that no significant environmental impacts can be \nexpected from project implementation. The IEE was disclosed on 18 November 2013. However, \nit has listed potential risks\u2014change in land use, inundation of the project area by flooding,   \npossible occupational health and safety effects on workers during construction, and potential \nnoise nuisance, and pollution from unmanaged solid waste disposal. The CAAN will comply with \nand implement the environmental management plan in the IEE by adopting proper mitigation \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, or compensate for any adverse environmental impacts. It will \nestablish a mechanism to resolve grievances by affected people. The CAAN also prepared an \nenvironmental impact assessment report for extension of the runway to 3,000 meters, which the \nMinistry of Environment approved on 15 March 2011. Implementation arrangements provide for \ninputs by environmental specialists at the project coordination unit and project management and \nimplementation units to implement the environmental management plan effectively, undertake \nmonitoring, and submit reports periodically to ADB. \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The  overall  risk  assessment  is  low,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24   \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImplementation  may  be The PCU and PMIUs have been established with adequate staffing.
