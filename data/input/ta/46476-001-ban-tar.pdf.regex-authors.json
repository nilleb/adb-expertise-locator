INTRODUCTION \n1.  Technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  a  comprehensive  national  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) initiative of the Government of Bangladesh known as Digital \nBangladesh. It will facilitate the introduction of e-services across sectors and seek to broaden \nopportunities  to  significantly  strengthen  governance  in  line  with  the  government's  Digital \nBangladesh  strategy.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  effort  to  improve  transparency  and \naccountability initiated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through a tax and land record \nadministration project commenced in October 2011.1 \n \n2.  A  reconnaissance  mission  was  fielded  on  22\u201327  September  2012  to  explore \nopportunities  for  ADB  intervention  to  support  the  government's  national  ICT  initiative.  The \nmission met with line ministries and was requested to support the government\u2019s plan to expand \nand scale up e-services in rural areas by providing last mile connectivity2 components in union \nparishads.3 \n \n3.  A fact-finding mission on 4\u20138 November 2012 discussed and agreed on TA scope and \nimplementation  arrangements.  At  the  mission  wrap-up  meeting,  chaired  by  the  Economic \nRelations Division of the Ministry of Finance, all attending ministry officials concurred on the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Bangladesh is a developing nation recording annual growth rates of 5%\u20136% since 1996. \nWhile the government is achieving reasonable economic growth, infrastructure deficiencies, \ncorruption, and limited human resources constraint further growth. Strengthening governance \ncan help the country allocate limited resources more efficiently. While broad-reaching policy \nreforms are necessary to establish good governance, they must accommodate changes in \nservice delivery and be supported by technologies appropriate to the country. ICT has the \npotential to trigger and shape significant changes in the delivery of public services and how \ngovernments carry out their functions. The government has initiated a national ICT program \nunder the banner Digital Bangladesh since 20085 to foster growth and development and to \nenhance the quality of service delivery. \n \n5.  Despite the government\u2019s enthusiasm for attaining modernized government through e-\ngovernment  initiatives,  it  lacks  resources  and  expertise  to  make  much  headway.  The \ngovernment therefore requested support toward expanding broadband connectivity to the union \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Strengthening Governance Management Project. \nManila (Loan 2666-BAN and TA 7604-BAN, for $25 million, approved on 21 September 2010). The project seeks to \nimprove transparency and accountability in tax and land record administration in Bangladesh with the help of ICT. \nThree outputs of the project are (i) the online filing of tax returns, (ii) a digitized system of land records \nmanagement in selected districts, and (iii) improved access to tax and land information in specialized information \nand service centers. The executing agencies are the National Board of Revenue and the Directorate of Land \nRecords and Surveys in Bangladesh. \n2  The \"last mile\" in telecommunications refers to the final link of telecommunications networks with retail customers\u2014\nthe part that actually reaches customers. In this report, the last mile refers to the high-speed broadband internet \nconnection for end users at the union level. \n3  Union parishads are the smallest local government administrative unit in Bangladesh. There are about 4,500 \nunions in Bangladesh. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 November 2012. \n5   Building a Digital Bangladesh is an election pledge of the present Government. \n ", "2   \nlevel and developing an ICT master plan for a digital land management system (DLMS) guided \nby international experience. Building on ADB member countries\u2019 experience in e-government, \nADB can help the government achieve its objectives more effectively and innovatively. The TA \nwill be designed to fill implementation gaps in the government\u2019s national ICT initiative. \n \n6.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy6 and recommendations \nmade in ADB\u2019s 2009 country assistance program evaluation for Bangladesh, which found that \nthe lack of good governance is a binding constraint on growth and recommended support for \nfurther  governance  reforms.  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2012\u20132014  for \nBangladesh focuses on providing assistance in this area.7 The TA will build on previous ADB \ninterventions in ICT.8 Recognizing ICT as a tool for improving governance, ADB identified areas \nin which ICT can play a critical role in enhancing efficiency, transparency, and accountability in \npublic service delivery in Bangladesh. \n \n7.  The fact-finding mission confirmed the urgent need to support public management and \ndistrict development through e-solutions.9 The TA will (i) support extending e-services with last \nmile connectivity in a selected district, (ii) pilot several e-services in selected unions and public \ninstitutions, (iii) improve the grievance redress system (GRS), and (iv) develop an ICT master \nplan for a DLMS. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the project will be enhanced public trust through ICT service development \nand delivery in a selected district.10 The project outcome will be a complete e-governance \nimplementation plan for a selected district adopted by the relevant government agency.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA envisages a phased approach that can transform service delivery by building on \npilot and demonstrative initiatives in key e-governance areas in both the central government and \na pilot district, toward facilitating replication in other districts over time.  \n \n10.  The TA will have four outputs: (i) a feasibility study for e-services extension through last \nmile connectivity for a selected district, (ii) piloted e-services in selected unions and public \ninstitutions,  (iii)  Development  of  a  plan  to  redesign  GRS,  and  (iv)  development  of  a \ncomprehensive master plan for a DLMS. \n \n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n7  ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n8  Bangladesh is a member of the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program, which was initiated in \nrecognition of the importance of ICT to development and of the potential benefits from regional cooperation in ICT. \nADB has supported the program since 2001. In July 2005, ADB approved a grant for the project Empowering the \nRural  Areas  through  Community  e-Centers,  which  aimed  to  apply  ICT to  speed  the  development  of  rural \ncommunities in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal under the program. ADB provided TA in 2010 to study rural \nareas in Bangladesh with an eye to developing rural connectivity. \n9  These are information technology applications for public administration or online public services using the internet. \n10 Divisions in Bangladesh are divided into 64 districts. The districts are further subdivided into about 500 subdistricts, \nor upazilas, which are analogous to counties and are further divided into unions. \n ", "3 \n11.  The feasibility study for e-services extension through the last mile connectivity for a \nselected district will inform the pilot project targeting selected unions and public institutions and \nestablishing a model to be replicated across a selected district and, eventually, the entire nation.  \n \n12.  Piloted  e-services  in  selected  unions  and  public  institutions  will  undertake,  where \nnecessary, the physical extension of last mile connectivity to target areas and provide the \nmeans to estimate investment requirements for up-scaling to extend last mile connectivity to all \nunions of a district.  \n \n13.  The  development  of  a  plan  to  redesign  GRS  will  facilitate  the  introduction  of  an \nautomated GRS in the Government of Bangladesh, which will strengthen governance at the \ngrass  roots,  providing  a  systemic  way  of  addressing  citizens\u2019  grievance  through  a  direct \ncommunications channel with responsible government agencies. \n \n14.  The development of a comprehensive master plan for a DLMS will include financial and \nimplementation plans and entail the development of a methodology, investment needs, a project \ntimeline, and the technological requirements for a complete plot-by-plot survey of the country. \nThe  plan  will  determine  how  to  update  and  map  records  of  rights  and  detail  software \nrequirements and electronic interface schemes to facilitate the seamless flow of land data in the \nLand Ministry and Law Ministry. The study is expected to show how e-solutions can deliver \nservices from both ministries and from local governments directly to citizens, such as the timely \nelectronic  issuance  of  records  of  rights,  the  electronic  registration  of  deeds,  and  related \nservices. \n \n15.  Achieving TA outputs and outcome depend on strong ownership by implementation \nagencies. To mitigate risks associated with political changes after the 2014 elections, constant \ncoordination and engagement with the executing agency is required. Risks arising from a lack of \ncoordination among government agencies or a loss of implementing agency commitment to TA \ncomponents must be mitigated by continuous follow-up and monitoring. ADB\u2019s Bangladesh \nResident Mission will have an important monitoring role. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,320,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV) and $500,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund.  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of  counterpart staff, office and housing \naccommodation, office supplies, secretarial services, domestic transportation, and other in-kind \ncontributions. All disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Cabinet Division of the Government of Bangladesh will be the executing agency. \nThe implementing agencies will be the Ministry of Post and Telecommunication for last mile \nconnectivity (output 1), the Ministry of ICT for providing e-services (output 2), the Cabinet \nDivision for implementing the GRS (output 3), and the Ministry of Land for developing an ICT \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmaster  plan  for  a  DLMS  (output  4).

These contributions will not be financed using ADB-administered \nfunds but on their own. The TA will be jointly implemented by ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department and its South Asia Department, with interdepartmental coordination \nthrough  designated  focal  points.  The  project  team  will  include  experts  in  ADB\u2019s  Office  of \nInformation Systems and Technology. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2015. ADB will engage a \nconsulting firm or institution to work in association with international and national consultants. It \nwill be engaged using quality- and cost-based selection at a ratio of 80:20 and a simplified \ntechnical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). If no qualified firm can be found, individual consultants will be \nengaged.  The  TA  will  require  23  person-months  of  international  consultant  inputs  and  35 \nperson-months of national consultant inputs on an intermittent basis, responding to government \nrequirements and implementation progress. All procured assets will be transferred to beneficiary \nlocal governments after TA completion. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n19.  The progress of the TA will be evaluated against performance targets and indicators \ndefined in Appendix 1. A baseline will be established during the preliminary study to benchmark \npublic services in selected unions and public institutions and thus allow the impact of piloted e-\nservices to be evaluated after implementation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated to the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund; \nand (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Bangladesh  for  Improving  Public  Administration  and  Services  Delivery \nthrough E-Solutions, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n11 The National Information Society Agency (NIA) is being considered as a potential in-kind contributor to the TA \nbecause the Republic of Korea has been recognized for its best practices in ICT and e-government and the NIA is \na focal government agency for the national ICT and e-Government policy and strategy under the Ministry of Public \nAdministration and Security (MOPAS) of the Republic of Korea. \n ", "Appendix 1  5   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nEnhanced public  Citizen satisfaction with  Official reports published  Government \ntrust through ICT  public services improved  or announcements made  commitment to \nservice  through e-solutions by  by government agencies in  reengineering public \ndevelopment and  10% (from 2011 levels)  Bangladesh  administrative \ndelivery in a  by 2016 in a target district    procedures to introduce \nselected district  Indicator for measuring  e-solutions \ntransparency \n \nAccountability indicator \nOutcome      Assumption \nA complete e- Acceptance of the full e- Official published reports  Implementing agencies \ngovernance  governance  or announcements made  exhibiting strong \nimplementation  implementation plan for a  by the relevant  ownership of the TA \nplan for a selected  selected district adopted  government agency in   \ndistrict adopted by  by a government agency  Bangladesh  Risk \nthe relevant   by 2014  General e-government \ngovernment agency  absorptive capacity and \nspecialized government \ntechnical capacity \nlacking \nOutputs   A feasibility study for e- Proposed implementing  Assumption \n1.
