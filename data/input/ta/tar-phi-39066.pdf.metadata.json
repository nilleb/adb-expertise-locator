The Government of the Republic of the Philippines requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for assistance to support the implementation of the Health Sector Reform Agenda \n(HSRA) in April 2004.1 The ADB Fact-Finding Mission of May 2005 reached an understanding \nwith the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation \narrangements  of  the  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA).2  The  TA  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Overall, the health status of the population of the Philippines has improved in the past \ndecade. The infant mortality rate (IMR) declined from 57 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 50 per \n1,000 live births by 1998,3 and is comparable with that of other countries in East and Southeast \nAsia. Maternal mortality ratio was 180 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1998, down from 209 in \n1990, but still much above the regional average. Intracountry variations are evident: IMR is higher \nin Eastern Visayas (60), and IMR in rural areas is at least one third higher than in urban areas. \nThe demographic and epidemiological transition has resulted in a dual burden (communicable \nand noncommunicable) of disease: the top 10 causes of morbidity are still communicable in \nnature,  such  as  pneumonia,  measles,  and  diarrhea.  Other  preventable  diseases,  such  as \ntuberculosis, are on the rise. The top 10 causes of death among adults are, however, non-\ncommunicable,  such  as  cardiovascular  diseases  resulting  from  changing  lifestyles, \ndemographics, and diets. The challenges faced by the health sector\u2014devolution, public sector \nprograms not prioritizing the needs of the population, and the recent budget crisis\u2014are expected \nto result in a slower pace of improvement in health status, thereby threatening the country\u2019s \nchances of meeting the health-related Millennium Development Goals. \n \n3.  Expenditures for Health. Total health spending in the Philippines was estimated at 5% of \ngross national product in 2001, having increased from 3.5% in 1997. However, a large portion of \nhealth care cost compromises household out-of-pocket expenditures (43%), while the public \nsector\u2019s  share  of  total  health  expenditure  (of  37%:  17%  from  national  and  20%  from  local \ngovernments) has declined, and the national health insurance program coverage remains low \n(8% in 2001). Most public resources are allocated to curative health care, while only 13% of \nresources are spent for public health programs.4  \n \n4.  Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA). In view of these challenges, the Department of \nHealth (DOH) initiated HSRA in 1999. Devolution, following the Local Government Code of 1991, \nhad fragmented the health service delivery system, as administrative and financial responsibilities \nhave been shared since then among central, provincial, and local authorities, without effective \ncoordination and cooperation mechanisms in place. As a result, public health programs suffered \nmost from an apparent lack of attention. The budget deficit of the national Government and \ndeclining  public  sector  resources  aggravated  the  situation.  HSRA  was  introduced  to  help \nstreamline the health service delivery system with a comprehensive program covering five broad \nareas of reform:5 (i) providing fiscal autonomy to hospitals, (ii) securing funding for priority public \nhealth programs, (iii) promoting the development of local health systems and ensuring their \neffective  performance,  (iv)  strengthening  capacities  of  health  regulatory  agencies,  and  (v) \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004.

Manila.  \n5  The Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA) does not include two priority areas of human resource development, or \nimproving the health information systems. HSRA-plus will include these two cross-cutting areas. \n ", "2   \nexpanding coverage of the national health insurance program. In summary, HSRA was expected \nto  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  health  service  delivery  system  by  integrating  health  care \npromotion and prevention, improving referral links, reducing the need for hospitalization, and \nthereby improving the allocation and use of resources. \n \n5.  Hospital Reform. The HSRA objective is to rationalize health service delivery, prioritize \nprimary health care development over hospitalization, and introduce cost-efficient measures in \nhospital operation. Currently, at least 52% of hospital beds in the country are provided by the \npublic sector. Several provinces have a surplus of hospital beds, and many hospitals face a low \nbed occupancy rate. Many hospitals have only from 10 to 25 beds, and therefore cannot benefit \nfrom economies of scale. The quality of these hospitals has been questioned; many of them are \nnot accredited. Roles of core referral (district) hospitals and referral links wait to be defined, and \ntheir  service  mix  identified.  A  large  share  of  the  national  Government  budget  for  health  is \nallocated to hospital investment and operations; however, the share varies by province, and by \nlocal government. Hospitals do not have fiscal or managerial autonomy and lack incentives to \nimprove service quality, as they are unable to retain or use savings even for operations and \nmaintenance, or for staff performance incentives. \n \n6.  Public  Health  Reform.  The  HSRA  objective  promotes  cost-effective  public  health \ninterventions and their integration in the devolved health service delivery system. Public health \nprograms, such as family planning (as part of reproductive health), tuberculosis detection, and \nhealthy lifestyles, lack adequate financing despite the programs\u2019 many benefits for the poor and \nsignificant  positive  externalities  for  society.  Several  public  health  programs  of  DOH  are  not \nintegrated within the devolved health service delivery system. Budget preparation is on annual, \nrather than multiyear basis, thereby preventing long-term planning and the continuity of program \nimplementation. National Government subsidies allocated to local government units (LGUs) that \nare responsible for implementing public health programs are based on historical estimates and \nnot LGUs\u2019 actual needs. Community-based care is reasonably well-regulated with regard to \nselected services (such as child immunizations), but many health care providers are inadequately \ntrained or motivated. Few incentives are provided to encourage care providers to be aware of, \nand comply with, best practices. Despite progress in recent years, tremendous opportunities still \nexist to better involve the private and nonprofit health sector in public health programs.   \n \n7.  Local Health Systems Reform. The HSRA objective is to strengthen the capacity for \ndecentralized health service delivery. Many problems result from the complexities of devolution, \nwhich has created unfunded mandates for LGUs because the agreed-upon package of health \nservices transferred to LGUs does not match budget allocations; there is no integrated and \nsystematic health service referral network among LGUs; the national Government\u2019s package of \ntechnical assistance for devolved activities is insufficient; and quality assurance standards are not \napplied consistently. The concept of interlocal health zones (ILHZs) was therefore introduced to \ncreate an integrated referral network among a number of LGUs and to improve quality, efficiency, \nand effectiveness of health service provision. While some ILHZs have been piloted, integrated \nreferral networks (public and private), which will prevent patients from bypassing the lower health \nfacilities  and  consequently  running  up  the  costs  of  healthcare  are  yet  to  be  set  up.  With \ndevolution, DOH lost its budget to provide technical assistance for most devolved activities, and \ncurrently  supports  only  relatively  poor  municipalities  (fiscal  category  IV\u2013VI  out  of  6).  The \nGovernment is considering financing modality to assist LGUs in capital investment. \n \n8.  Health  Regulation  Reform.  The  HSRA  objective  is  to  streamline  the  regulatory \nframework  for  improved  health  service  delivery.  Regulatory  responsibilities  lie  with  DOH; \nhowever,  many  regulations  are  outdated  (predating  devolution)  and  implementation  remains \nweak. With devolution, drugs and medical devices are procured at LGU rather than at provincial \n ", "  3\nlevel. As a result, prices for drugs are higher, since economies of scale or standardization cannot \ncome into effect, and problems in quality control are created. Lack of guidance in coordinating \nwith  the  private  health  sector  has  also  resulted  in  missed  opportunities  for  better \ncomplementarities and minimum duplication of services. In addition, although quality assurance \nstandards exist to ensure good performance at rural health units (RHUs) and hospitals, standards \ndiffer  between  agencies\u2014such  as  DOH  for  certification  or  licensing  and  Philippines  Health \nInsurance Corporation (PhilHealth) for accreditation\u2014and require harmonization and improved \nmonitoring.  \n \n9.  Health Care Finance Reform. The HSRA objective is to shift the burden of health care \ncosts from household out-of-pocket expenditures to the public sector and to PhilHealth. The \ncoverage of the population is to be expanded, especially to reach the poor (indigents) and the \ninformal sector by providing packages of tailor-made benefits. PhilHealth coverage is still low \noverall, and very uneven among provinces. Nationwide, only 20% of indigents are covered. \nHowever, counting the enrolled poor is difficult as poverty data do not exist at municipal levels, \nand LGUs cannot appropriately map where the poor are. In addition, the current benefits package \nis limited, and does not provide preventive health care or basic curative care against catastrophic \nillnesses.  \n \n10.  Governance Reform. The HSRA gives little attention to reform in the area of human \nresources.  In  2003,  the  Government  endorsed  a  rationalization  policy  for  public  sector \nemployees.  Each  department  is  expected  to  justify  its  staff  requirements  and  prepare  a \nrationalization implementation plan in 2005. DOH has developed a health human resource master \nplan and is seeking assistance in implementing it. Among the issues highlighted in the master \nplan  are  (i)  an  inappropriate  staff  skills  mix,  (ii)  lack  of  incentives,  (iii)  lack  of  a  career \ndevelopment scheme, (iv) uneven distribution of medical and paramedical staff at local levels, \nand (v) the concentration of health professionals in urban areas, creating acute shortages in rural \nareas. \n \n11.  Development Partners. ADB, through the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP),6 \nis the first development partner to provide DOH with comprehensive support for implementing \nHSRA. The goal of the HSDP is to improve the health status of the poor by promoting cost-\neffective health interventions with an efficient, rationalized, and integrated health service delivery \nsystem. Several other development partners are supporting HSRA in specific areas: the World \nHealth Organization in developing of performance-oriented budgeting for priority public health \nprograms; the World Bank in hospital payment, performance-oriented budgeting for public health \nprograms, and drug management; the European Commission in regulatory reforms and public \nfinance; the German Technical Cooperation in health insurance; and the United States Agency \nfor International Development in public\u2013private partnership for public health programs. \n \n12.  Rationale. The primary challenge facing the health sector is identifying ways to improve \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of health service delivery. The country is confronted with low \npublic sector performance in the health sector, as it inadequately addresses (i) the health needs \nof the population at large; (ii) the financing or risk-sharing mechanisms and burden of health care \ncost; and (iii) the inefficiencies, and unnecessary cost burden of health care. Devolution has \nhighlighted the limited resources and weak capacity at the LGU level. HSRA provides the strategy \nto overcome these obstacles. A rationalized health service delivery system is expected to lead to \nefficiency gains. Improved coverage under social health insurance will reduce household health \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the \nRepublic of the Philippines for the Health Sector Development Program. Manila (Loans 2136/2137-PHI for $213 \nmillion) includes a 2-year program loan, and a 6-year investment loan. \n ", "4   \ncare cost. Improved capacity for planning and implementation will introduce appropriate programs \nand  budgets  to  address  the  dual-disease  burden,  and  partnerships  with  the  private  and \nnongovernment sectors are expected to enhance the effectiveness of health service delivery.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA will provide support to enhance the implementation of HSRA and increase the \nutilization of affordable and financially sustainable quality health services by the poor. The TA will \nhelp build DOH capacity to streamline policy and refine monitoring systems, and assist LGUs to \ninitiate and implement these reforms. The TA will help the Government give HSRA a head start in \nthe 15 selected convergence sites7 by streamlining policies; developing guidelines, concepts, and \nadministrative orders; and harmonizing the processes between involved public actors at the \ncentral level. The TA will particularly accelerate HSRA implementation in up to five convergence \nsites under the HSDP.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will consist of two components: (i) support for HSRA implementation, and (ii) \ninitiatives to enhance the capacity of the local health care system under HSRA. The TA team will \nwork closely with the Government and other stakeholders to help strengthen ongoing HSRA \nactivities, in a timely fashion, through a comprehensive methodological assessment, technical \nreview  building  on  international  experiences,  preparation  of  systems,  and  enhancing \nimplementation capacity. The TA will have the following outputs: \n(i)  Improved  efficiency  in  core  referral  hospitals.  Streamline  mechanisms  in core \nreferral hospitals for improved performance by providing adequate incentives, such as \nfiscal and managerial autonomy to retain earnings and savings, and to appropriately \nmonitor that autonomy through a strengthened hospital financial management system. \n(ii)  Improved quality of public health provision supported by adequate budgets. \nImprove the quality of care in health service delivery by introducing cost-effective \npublic health interventions, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in health facilities, and \npiloting multiyear programs and budgets for public health interventions in the LGUs. \n(iii)  Improved  quality  of  health  services  delivery  at  the  local  level.  Provide  an \nintegrated  framework  for  a  rationalized  health  system  at  LGU  level  that  includes \nprimary health care, first and second referral levels in the context of each ILHZ; \naddress priority needs related to the dual burden of disease; and explore measures to \nimprove  effectiveness  of  services  like  the  procurement  and  deployment  of \nequipments,  drugs,  and  supplies.  Develop  a  plan  for  health  professionals\u2019 \ndevelopment\u2014physicians, nurses, midwives, health administrators, and managers\u2014\nand  propose  streamlined  policies,  programs,  and  incentive  schemes,  as  well  as \nrefresher retraining program for health staff of LGUs.  \n(iv)  Harmonized regulatory procedures. Develop and experiment a pilot strategy for \nmore cost-efficient procurement of drugs, including standardizing quality and prices of \ndrugs.  \n                                                 \n7  In 2003, the Department of Health (DOH) identified 15 convergence sites, as the first set of 15 out of the 79 \nprovinces to achieve HSRA. The convergence site approach is a DOH strategy for phasing HSRA implementation in \nthe provinces over time. \n ", "  5\n(v)  Increased coverage of beneficiaries under PhilHealth. Propose new schemes to \nPhilHealth to increase enrollment of the poor and of informal sector beneficiaries, with \na  package  of  tailor-made  benefits,  including  one  for  primary  health  care  and  for \nprotecting these beneficiaries against the financial burden from catastrophic illnesses; \nand develop LGUs capacity for needs-based budgeting and for transparent fiduciary \narrangements. \n(vi)  Financing modality. Propose financing modality to the Department of Finance for \ncapital investment to LGUs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,430,000 equivalent, comprising $440,000 in the \nforeign exchange and $990,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB  to  finance  $1,000,000  (70%)  equivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of \n$440,000 and $560,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $430,000 (30%), through the provision of office space, furniture, \ncounterparts, and workshop facilities. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be attached to the undersecretary for external affairs of DOH, technically led \nby the director of the Bureau of Health Policy Development and Planning, and based at the HSRA \nresource center. A technical coordinating group will oversee the progress of the TA, ensure its \ncoherence with government policy and the efficient delivery of the outputs, and guide and review \nthe outputs of consultants.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented in 18 months (September 2005\u2013February 2007). A team of \ninternational and domestic consultants will implement the TA components. The consultants will be \nengaged either individually or through a firm under quality- and cost-based selection, using \nsimplified technical proposals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.  Procurement of \noffice  equipment,  computers,  and  printers  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  Specialists will provide 18 person-months of international and 96 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services. Consultants for the following areas will be recruited: district health \nplanning and management, health systems, hospital financial management, health finance/social \nhealth insurance, public health, drug procurement management, human resource planning, and \nfinance. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference and reporting schedules are in Appendix 3.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for Support for Health Sector Reform, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets/Indicators  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact       \n\u2022 Increased  \u2022 Reduced tuberculosis incidence among  \u2022 National demographic   \nutilization of  children under-5 years in the bottom  health survey \naffordable and  income (or expenditure) quartile of  \u2022 National health accounts \nfinancially  population by 2008  \u2022 Public expenditure reviews \nsustainable  \u2022 Reduced incidence of risk factors (e.g.,   \nquality health  iron deficiency anemia) among pregnant \nservices by the  women in the bottom income (or \npoor in the 15  expenditure) quartile of the population by \nHealth Sector  2008 \nReform Agenda  \u2022 Increased utilization of public sector health \n(HSRA)  facilities by the bottom income (or \nconvergence  expenditure) quartile of the population by \nsites  2008 \nOutcome      \u2022 Public expenditures for \n\u2022 Department of  \u2022 Increased proposed and endorsed budget  \u2022 National demographic  health sector financing \nHealth (DOH) to  (of 2007) for public health (as a proportion  health survey  stagnate or are even \nstreamline  of total public sector health spending, and  \u2022 National health accounts  reduced due to fiscal \nHSRA policy  a contribution through public-private mix)  \u2022 Public expenditure reviews  and financial problems \nand refine  in the Health Sector Development  of national government \nmonitoring  Program (HSDP) project sites by end of  and LGUs.
