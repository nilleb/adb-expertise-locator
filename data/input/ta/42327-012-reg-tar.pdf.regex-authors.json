INTRODUCTION \n1.  As a flagship publication of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Asian Development \nOutlook (ADO) has become an important vehicle for enhancing ADB\u2019s reputation as a credible \nand authoritative source of knowledge about Asia and the Pacific. The report\u2019s analysis provides \ninsights  into  the  economic  issues  faced  by  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  and  appropriate  policy \nresponses. Its content informs ADB Management opinion and guides institutional views about \nthe region\u2019s macroeconomic prospects and important development issues. The production of \nthe ADO has been regularly supported by technical assistance (TA) funding.1 The objectives, \nscope, and activities to be covered by the regional TA are in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The TA Strategic Forum 2008 recognized the important role that flagship publications \nsuch as the ADO play in monitoring the major economic issues and trends of ADB's developing \nmember  countries  (DMCs).  By  regularly  providing  comprehensive  analysis  on  evolving \ndevelopments in DMCs, the ADO provides a basis for understanding the key drivers of, and \nconstraints on, economic growth\u2014a critical element for inclusive economic growth, which is one \nof the priority research areas under Strategy 2020.3 Also, under the new streamlined business \nprocesses, the ADO has been established as the main reference for the economic assessment \nand outlook section of the country partnership strategy.  \n \n3.  In addition to the country-by-country and regional economic analyses, the ADO in its \nrecent issues has featured timely topics on rebalancing growth, macroeconomic management \nbeyond the global financial crisis, and South\u2013South economic links. These are all important \nissues that have been brought to the fore in the wake of the recent global financial crisis. \nDiscussion of these topics has important policy implications for developing Asia in sustaining \nlong-term growth in the face of global uncertainties.  \n \n4.  To address one of the development agendas of Asia and the Pacific as envisioned in \nStrategy 2020, the theme chapter of ADO 2012 will analyze issues relating to equality of \nopportunities and inclusive growth. This is of particular value since evidence suggests that \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s high economic growth rates in the past two decades have not been inclusive, \ni.e., the benefits of growth have not been widely shared, with the incomes of the rich rising much \nfaster than those of the poor.4 Bridging the gap between Asia\u2019s rich and poor, both in terms of \nincome and non-income opportunities, will be pivotal in sustaining Asia\u2019s growth. This research \nis in support of an initiative of the Economics and Research Department (ERD) to operationalize \ninclusive growth to inform policy making in DMCs. The preliminary results can also be an \nimportant input into the upcoming Asian Development Fund replenishment discussions. For the \nADO 2012 Update, the theme topic will focus on the services sector. It will examine if the sector \ncan provide an alternative source of employment in Asia\u2019s middle-income countries5 in the face \n                                                 \n1  ADO 2012 has been identified as a corporate priority TA in the January 2011 TA resource allocation meeting. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 July 2011. \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n4  An analysis in Key Indicators 2007 revealed that, in 14 DMCs, inequality as measured by Gini coefficient and the \nratio of the top 20% to bottom 20% expenditure or income shares has increased from a period in the 1990s to the \n2000s. (ADB. 2007. Key Indicators 2007. Manila.) \n5  Includes the People\u2019s Republic of China, Fiji, Georgia, India, Kazakhstan, Kiribati, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, Malaysia, Maldives, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Papua \nNew  Guinea,  the  Philippines,  Palau,  Samoa,  Solomon  Islands,  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand,  Timor-Leste,  Tonga, \nTurkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, and Viet Nam (World Bank classification). \n ", "2   \nof declining labor demand in the manufacturing sector. ERD will study how services can be \nmade more open and tradable to allow the sector to contribute to Asia\u2019s future growth. \n \n5.  ERD must work continuously to improve the analytical rigor and policy relevance of the \nreport if it is to remain a credible, independent source of knowledge and information about Asia \nand the Pacific. The rising profile of the ADO has also highlighted the need to strengthen the \nmethods used to derive the global baseline assumptions and country forecasts. Activities will \ninclude conducting  applied  and  policy research on  the  issues  of inclusive  growth  and  the \nservices sector in developing Asia, building and sustaining capacity in macroeconomic modeling, \nacquiring  new  sources  of  information,  and  strengthening  peer  review.  High-quality  editing \nservices are also crucial to ensure that the ADO\u2019s key messages are communicated clearly and \neffectively.  \n \n6.  To ensure that the messages and policy recommendations of the ADO reach the target \naudience, the launch and outreach activities must be carefully planned to make the ADO more \neffective.  There  is  a  huge  demand  for  an  Asian  voice,  and  disseminating  the  messages \nemanating from the ADO effectively can provide that.  \n \n7.  The ADO is one of the most frequently downloaded publications from ADB\u2019s website.6 It \nis directly or indirectly the source of much international and national news commentary that \nfeatures analysis, views, and opinions from ADB. Thus, a concerted effort to produce a high-\nquality publication is vital to elevate the publication\u2019s profile and to ensure its relevance and \nusefulness in policy dialogues and formulation in ADB DMCs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will support activities that influence the intellectual environment within which \nauthorities in developing Asia and the Pacific formulate economic policies. ADO 2012 and its \nupdate will provide in-depth, relevant, and timely assessments of the region\u2019s economy and, at \nthe same time, analyze the issue of inclusive growth in the context of equality of opportunities \nand the development of the services sector in developing Asia. Analyses from the publication \nwill provide important empirical facts and policy recommendations that can promote ADB as an \nindependent and authoritative source of knowledge about Asia and the Pacific. Appendix 2 \ncontains the draft contents pages of ADO 2012 and ADO 2012 Update.  \n \n9.  The TA will support the further development and refinement of analytical methods to \nsupplement ADB\u2019s short- and medium-term country economic monitoring and reporting. This will \nstrengthen the economic underpinnings of country programs and strategies for the DMCs, \nthereby creating better-informed and better-designed economic policies and enhancing ADB\u2019s \ncountry assistance. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The main outputs of the TA will be the two publications: ADO 2012 and ADO 2012 \nUpdate.  The  following  key  activities  will  be  supported  by  the  TA:  preparing  background \n                                                 \n6  From 2006 to 2011, the ADO and ADO Update have consistently ranked among the top ADB downloads from the \nmonth of launch until the following year. At the time of their launches, the ADO and ADO Update have continued to \ngenerate significant coverage from both global and regional top-tier media, such as the Financial Times, the Asian \nWall Street Journal, and the International Herald Tribune. \n ", "  3 \nanalytical  papers,  capacity  building  on  macroeconomic  modeling,  further  developing  and \nrefining analytical methods, drafting ADO content, economic and copyediting, preparing and \nlaying out materials for publication, and disseminating key results and policy messages. Some \nactivities to support initiatives to build capacity for macroeconomic modeling, generating growth \nprojections, and monitoring markets will be supported by the TA. This will be linked to a bigger \ninitiative within ERD that aims to build a \u2015modeling culture\u2016 within ADB, and would include \neconomists in the regional departments, especially those involved in the preparation of the \ncountry chapters, and possibly ADB\u2019s Office of Regional Economic Integration. Several activities \nfor the preparation of ADO 2013 will also be supported under the TA.  \n \n11.  Background research papers to provide a solid empirical and analytical foundation for \nADO content will be produced under the TA. These papers will supplement the research work of \nADB\u2019s Macroeconomics and Finance Research Division (ERMF) on the selected theme topics, \nanalyzing issues and policy implications for the DMCs covered. An advisory group consisting of \nabout four leading researchers will be formed to provide direction and guidance on the research \ntopics  for  both  ADO  2012  and  ADO  2012  Update.  The  advisory  group  will  meet  (via \nvideoconference)  thrice  in  the  course  of  preparing  the  background  papers  (inception  and \nbrainstorming, midterm, and finalization meetings).  \n  \n12.  Workshops and conferences will be organized as part of ADO preparation to strengthen \nthe content. The writers\u2019 workshop will focus on macroeconomic analysis of current issues, \ngrowth accounting, economic projections and macroeconomic modeling, and effective writing \nskills, which will target selected economists and national staff in regional departments and \nresident missions who are responsible for writing the country chapters. One of the objectives of \nthe workshop on effective writing is to equip writers with the skills needed to craft high-quality \ncountry chapters. This will also impart skills that are of broader relevance for economic and \nsector work, which underpins country strategies. The conferences will focus on the reports\u2019 \ntheme chapters. Distinguished economists from the region will be invited to discuss initial drafts \nof the background papers to improve the analytical rigor and policy relevance of the theme \nchapters. \n \n13.  To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency in approach across the different parts \nof the ADO, high-quality editing services are required. Economic and copyediting activities will \nbe  provided  by  international consultants  working  under the  direction  of the  assistant chief \neconomist of ERMF.  \n \n14.  In collaboration with Department of External Relations (DER), the reports will be widely \ndisseminated. The initial media launch will be followed by presentations co-hosted by ADB \ndevelopment partners within and outside Asia and the Pacific. Outreach will also include more \nanalytical discussions of the issues in partnership with academic institutions and think tanks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA. \nGiven the high institutional profile of the ADO, the chief economist will report to the vice-\n ", "4   \npresident for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development, and the President at \ncritical points in the publications\u2019 preparation. The TA is expected to start in September 2011 \nand be completed by March 2013. \n \n17.  The  production  of a  high-quality ADO  will  be a  joint  effort of  ERD (led  by ERMF) \neconomists, country economists of the regional departments and resident missions, national \nexperts, international consultants, and economics editors. As in previous years, ERMF will seek \nthe cooperation of the regional departments to coordinate with the resident missions on the \npreparation of the country chapters.   \n \n18.  The  ADO  will  require  20  person-months  of  international  consultancy  resources  for \neconomists who will prepare the background papers and analyses on the issue of equality of \nopportunity and inclusive growth, and provide support as part of the advisory group. In addition, \nthe  TA  will  require  an  estimated  20  person-months  of  international  consultants\u2019  time  for \neconomic and technical editing of ADO manuscripts before final publication of ADO 2012 and \nADO 2012 Update. Three person-months of national economic consultants\u2019 time will also be \nrequired to assist in conducting research on different macroeconomic topics, and another 13 \nperson-months will be needed for the desktop publishing and graphic design requirements of \nthe publication. Consultants will be hired as individuals7 or by partnering with a highly reputable \ninternational economic policy research institute. Resource persons will also be engaged to \nconduct  training  on  macroeconomics  and  economic  forecasting  and  may  also  serve  as \ndiscussants  during  the  workshops.  Consultants  and  resource  persons  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The outline terms of reference for the consultants and resource persons are in Appendix \n4.   \n \n19.  The TA will finance the procurement of information and knowledge services, such as \nsubscription to macroeconomic data providers (e.g., Bloomberg), as may be required to support \nrelevant and up-to-date content. Equipment, such as computers and software to support the \nmacroeconomic modeling work, will be purchased by ADB in accordance with its Procurement \nGuidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  in  coordination  with  the  Office  of \nInformation Systems and Technology and Office of Administrative Services, where applicable. \nUpon the completion of the TA, the equipment will remain with ADB as it will be used in \nimplementing subsequent ADO TA. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n20.  ADO workshops will be conducted to review and discuss the initial country chapters and \nbackground papers prepared for the ADO. These are tentatively scheduled for November and \nDecember 2011 and June 2012 at ADB headquarters. Annotated outlines and storylines of \ncountry  chapters  will  be  presented  during  the  November  workshop,  while  theme  chapter \nbackground papers for ADO 2012 will be discussed in the December workshop. The ADO 2012 \nUpdate background materials will be discussed during the June workshop. The TA will also \ncover the travel expenses of selected resident mission staff who will be participating in the \nworkshops as resource persons. \n \n21.  The TA will support the dissemination activities of ERD and DER. The major results and \nkey policy messages emerging from the ADO 2012 and ADO 2012 Update will be disseminated \n                                                 \n7  The consultants will be hired as individuals as the TA will require rapid mobilization of the editorial consultants and \nwill involve independent studies where the consultant\u2019s experience and qualification are the primary considerations.  \n ", "  5 \nto  the  media,  DMC  policy  makers,  and  academic  communities.  The  media  launch  and \nsubsequent  road  shows  will  be  undertaken  by  ERD  in  coordination  with  DER.  Separate \nlaunches will be undertaken by resident missions in selected DMCs in coordination with their \nregional departments and DER. Roundtable discussions and workshops in different academic \nand economic institutions will also be conducted to reach a wider audience. Both ADO 2012 and \nADO 2012 Update will be featured on the ADB website and copies, either in print or on CD-\nROMs, will be distributed worldwide. The TA may also support the translation of the ADO into \nother languages, as may be required, to support dissemination activities in selected DMCs. This \nwill be arranged by regional departments in coordination with the concerned resident missions \nand DER. \n \n22.  ERMF will closely monitor the work under the TA to ensure its effective implementation. \nERD researchers will review the work of consultants engaged to verify that tasks are completed \nin accordance with the terms of reference, and that draft reports are delivered on time. Peer \nreview of papers within ADB and, if possible, by other research and academic institutions will \nalso be used as a tool to evaluate the quality and depth of analysis of the research papers. The \nassistant chief economist at ERMF will set the production schedule, assure that adequate staff \nare assigned, and be responsible for meeting the deadlines for the timely printing and delivery \nof publications. The success of the dissemination activities will be monitored through web \ndownload statistics and media monitoring reports provided by DER. \n \n23.  Evaluation of outputs and outcomes will also be done to help measure the success of \nthe TA. ERMF postmortem evaluation of the overall ADO process will be conducted to identify \nstrengths and weaknesses as well as areas for improvement that will serve as inputs for the \nnext ADO. In fact, suggestions at the recent postmortem discussions among ERMF staff and \ncountry chapter authors will be utilized to improve the process for the preparation of country \nchapters. Reports and back-to-office reports on the conduct of the ADO and ADO Update \nlaunches will also be reviewed to gather feedback on the publications and learn lessons from \nthem. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION   \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Asian Development Outlook 2012, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nInfluence the  Regional and international  DER media monitoring  Key messages of the \nintellectual  reach of the ADO  report and web  ADO are communicated \nenvironment within    download statistics  effectively. \nwhich policy  Media coverage and     \nformulation occurs   readership  Publicly available  ADO reaches its target \n    citation data  audience in the policy \nPromote ADB\u2019s  Web downloads     and development \nreputation as an    ERMF and regional  community. \nauthoritative and  ADO citations in major  department   \nindependent source  newspapers and  consultations with  There is a significant \nof knowledge about  publications  stakeholders in DMCs  degree of interest in the \nAsia and the Pacific       DMCs\u2019 outlook. \n  External review and   \nBetter-informed and  feedback  \nRisk \nbetter-designed   \npolicies    Economic or other \nshocks may derail \n     \nbaseline assumptions, \n      analysis, and \nprojections, \nundermining their use in \npolicy dialogues.  \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nImproved content and  Stronger analytical content  ADB Management  Accurate and up-to- \nquality of ADO 2012  of the ADO and better  review and guidance  date information is \nand ADO 2012  analysis of economic    available for DMCs. \nUpdate that will  prospects  Regional department   \nprovide in-depth,    review and inputs \nRisk \nrelevant, and timely  High-quality ADO thematic   \nassessments of the  content  Peer review of content  Staff shortages or skill \nregional economy of    deficits \nAsia and the Pacific  Better cohesion and \n \nand individual DMC  balance among the \neconomies, which  different parts of the ADO \ncould strengthen the  and the ADO Update \neconomic   \nunderpinnings of  Use of the ADO content in \ncountry programs and  the preparation of country \nstrategies  partnership strategies and \neconomic sector work \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
