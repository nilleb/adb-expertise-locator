The Project is \ndirectly relevant to the human development needs of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  stated  in  the  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive \nDevelopment Framework and Education Strategy for 2010. It will \nalso contribute to the attainment of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) to reduce infant mortality rate (IMR) and under-five \nmortality rate (U5MR) and sustain universal primary education. \nThe Project will focus on the 12 poorest raions (districts), while \nensuring that the extended program of immunization will cover the \nneeds  of  all  eligible  children  in  the  country.  In  addition  to \ninterventions in health, nutrition, and education, the Project will \npay special attention to building the capacity of the ayil okmotus \n(AOs\u2013village authorities) and communities to plan, improve, and \nsustain child development. \n   \nRationale  Young  children  suffer  most  in  times  of  economic  contraction. \nInternational  research  shows  that  poverty  has  measurable \ndetrimental  effects  on  children\u2019s  physical  growth,  cognitive \ncapacity,  and  psychosocial  adjustment.  Long-term  impacts  are \nmost severe when children are unprotected in the years before \nthey enter school. Health, nutrition, and education directly impact \nthe lives of young children in poor families. Targeted programs \nthat  integrate  health,  nutrition,  and  education/care  for  young \nchildren offset the deleterious effects of poverty. Without targeted \ninterventions, the majority of children in poverty will not develop \nfully  in  their  early  years,  thus  permanently  diminishing  their \ncapacity  to  achieve  their  potential.  Recent  years  have  seen \ndeclines  in  budgets,  coverage,  and  quality  of  social  services, \nparticularly in rural and remote areas. Remote health posts and \nschools  are  the  last  to  benefit  from  supplies  or  training \nopportunities. Basic indicators on child development in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  show  substantial  scope  for  improvement.  Early \nchildhood  development  (ECD)  has  important  implications  for \nwomen as well since their lives are closely intertwined with their \nchildren\u2019s. ECD interventions will reduce women\u2019s time spent on \ncaring for sick children. Increased access to affordable preschool \nprograms  will  enable  women  to  avail  themselves  of  economic \nopportunities.   Reduction   of   iron   deficiency  anemia  (IDA) will  ", "iii \n  improve  women\u2019s  productivity,  and  reduce  pregnancy-related \nrisks, including maternal mortality. \n \nObjectives and Scope  The  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  health,  nutrition,  and \npsychosocial development of children between birth and 8 years \nof  age  in  the  12  poorest  raions.  Specific  objectives  are  to  (i) \nreduce IMR and U5MR, (ii) reduce iodine deficiency disorder, (iii) \nreduce IDA both among children and pregnant women, and (iv) \nimprove the psychosocial development of preschool children. By \nimproving  children\u2019s  health  and  nutrition  status  and  increasing \naccess to preschool programs, the Project can increase women\u2019s \neconomic  opportunities  outside  the  home.  The  Project  will \ncontribute  to  the  attainment  of  the  MDGs  to  reduce  IMR  and \nU5MR  and  to  achieve  universal  primary  education.  The \ncomponents and the strategies adopted under each follow: \n \nThe child health and nutrition component will (i) ensure universal \ncoverage  and  quality  of  immunization,  (ii)  improve  case \nmanagement  for  major  childhood  morbidities,  (iii)  improve \nfunctioning  of  primary  health  care  posts,  (iv)  universalize \nconsumption of iodized salt, and (v) introduce behavioral change \nto  prevent  IDA.  The  early  childhood  care  and  education \ncomponent will (i) improve access of poor children to preschool \nprograms,  including  state-run  preschools  and  community \npreschool programs; (ii) improve the quality of grade 1 education; \nand (iii) improve the quality of child care at home. The capacity \nbuilding  component  will  (i)  develop  the  capacity  of  local \ngovernments and communities to plan, implement, and monitor \nECD  activities,  and  (ii)  improve  collection  of  community  and \ncentral government data and monitoring of development indicators \nfor young children between birth and 8 years of age. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is $13.47 million equivalent. The \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of  $10.5 \nmillion equivalent from its Special Funds resources, representing \n78% of the total project cost. The Government will provide $2.57 \nmillion equivalent, and communities will contribute $0.40 million \nequivalent by sharing the cost of community projects.   \n   \n($\u2019000) \nFinancing Plan        Foreign  Local    Total  Percent \nSource     Exchange Currency   Cost    \n   Asian         \n   Development Bank       5,383       5,117  10,500      78\n   Government              0       2,570      2,570   19\n   Communities               0          400         400   3\n           \n    \n    Total       5,383       8,087  13,470    100\n   ", "iv \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  loan  of \nSDR7,545,000  equivalent from its Special Funds resources, with \na maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period, and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  To ensure strong leadership to coordinate the different ministries \nArrangements  involved,  the  President\u2019s  office  has  been  selected  as  the \nExecuting  Agency.  The  President\u2019s  office  will  have  overall \nresponsibility for project coordination and implementation, and will \nappoint a project coordinator from among its senior officials. The \nProject will establish a project management office in Bishkek. An \ninteragency steering committee will give advice and decide on \npolicy matters. Many project activities will be implemented by AOs \nand  communities.  To  support  decentralized  implementation,  a \nproject coordination office will be established in each of the three \nparticipating oblasts.   \n   \nExecuting Agency  The President\u2019s Office \n   \nProcurement  All ADB-financed goods and services will be procured following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment will be procured by \n(i)  international  competitive  bidding  for  contracts  valued  at \n$500,000 or more; (ii) international shopping for contracts below \n$500,000;  and  (iii)  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  or  direct \npurchase for items valued at less than $50,000. Due to the small \nand  scattered  nature  of  civil  works,  rehabilitation  of  physical \nfacilities  will  be  carried  out  through  LCB.  Furniture,  some \nequipment, and learning materials are produced locally. Domestic \nproduction  capacity,  quality,  and  prices  are  satisfactory.  Such \nitems will be procured through LCB. Vaccines will be procured \nthrough the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund under arrangements \nsatisfactory to the Ministry of Health and ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  ADB-financed consulting services by firms or individuals will be \nawarded  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. Consulting services financed under the loan will be \nfor  project  management  and  capacity  building  for  the  local \nadministration.  A  total  of  665  person-months  of  consulting \nservices (23 international and 642 domestic) will be required in \nmanagement,  finance,  procurement,  information  system,  early \nchildhood care and education, primary health care, community \nplanning  and  mobilization,  evaluation,  and  architecture/ \nengineering. \n   ", "v \nProject Benefits and  Direct  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  are  about  148,000  children \nBeneficiaries  between birth and 8 years of age in the 12 poorest raions. In \naddition, support for immunization will benefit all infants in the \ncountry.  The  Project  will  directly  enhance  the  development  of \nchildren and their future productivity.  \nThe Project will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of child \ndevelopment services. Some services in the health sector have \nbeen unable to achieve their full potential due to gaps in training \nand irregular supply of essential drugs. By bridging the gaps, the \nProject  will  improve  the  effectiveness  of  existing  services  at \nminimal additional cost. The Project will also improve the cost-\nefficiency of early education programs by introducing alternative \ncommunity-based models to complement formal preschools, and \nimproving child care at home.  \nThe Project will build the capacity of the AOs and communities. \nMany project activities will be implemented at the community level \nand managed by AOs. This focus on AOs and communities will \nimprove governance by bringing activities closer to the intended \nbeneficiaries, and facilitate the achievement of project objectives \nby providing\u2013through a village initiative fund\u2013opportunities for the \ncommunities to design and implement activities that meet their \nneeds.  \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  involves  almost  no  technical  risk.  The  selected \ninterventions have been tested and proven effective in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and internationally. The most significant challenge will be  \neffective implementation through multiple ministries and central \nand local government bodies. A steering committee consisting of \nexperienced representatives of concerned ministries and oblasts \n(provinces) has been established and will provide policy guidance \nto the Project. The Project provides for substantial training of AO \nrepresentatives and assistance of the child and family coordinator \nduring the first 2 years of project implementation. \n \nAnother  challenge  is  sustainability  of  the  services  after  the \ncompletion of the Project. Maintaining the quality of primary health \ncare and preschool programs will require predictable, timely, and \nadequate budget allocations. Recurrent costs will be about 1% of \nthe national health and education budget. The Project will ensure \nthat the Government develops sustainability plans for vaccines \nand essential drugs, which are the major needed supplies. \n   ", "vi \nTechnical Assistance  Technical  assistance  for  Institutional  Strengthening  for \nCommunity-Based Early Childhood Development aims to fill the \nmajor institutional and capacity gaps so that the Government can \npursue an effective ECD Program. The main objectives of the TA \nare  to  help  the  Government  (i)  develop  an  updated \ncomprehensive strategy for ECD; (ii) develop a monitoring and \nevaluation system for ECD; and (iii) introduce parent education \nmodels  to  improve  child  care  practice  at  home.  The  TA  will \nfinance consulting services for 13 person-months of international \nconsultants,  and  54  of  domestic  consultants  with  expertise  in \nECD;  preschool  standards;  information,  education,  and \ncommunication;  and  evaluation  and  monitoring.  The  total  TA \namount is estimated at $600,000 equivalent comprising $378,000 \nin foreign exchange and $222,000 equivalent in local currency \ncost. ADB will provide $500,000 as a grant from the Japan Special \nFund funded by the Government of Japan to finance the entire \nforeign exchange costs and $122,000 equivalent of local currency \nexpenditures.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining \n$100,000 equivalent in kind. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kyrgyz Republic for the Community-Based Early Childhood Development Project. The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening for \nCommunity-Based Early Childhood Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Young children suffer most in times of economic contraction. International research \nshows that poverty has measurable detrimental effects on children\u2019s physical growth, cognitive \ncapacity, and psychosocial adjustment. The long-term impacts of these effects are most severe \nwhen children are unprotected during the years before they enter school. Targeted programs \nthat integrate health, nutrition, and education/care for young children offset the deleterious \neffects  of  poverty.  Without  targeted  interventions,  the  majority  of  children  in  poverty  will \nexperience inadequate development in their early years, permanently diminishing their capacity \nto achieve their potential.   \n \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic has a population of 5 million, about 22% of whom are below 8 \nyears of age. The per capita income is about $300, the second lowest among Central Asian \ncountries, and poverty is prevalent. According to the National Statistical Committee, 40% and \n47% of the population live in poverty in urban and rural areas, respectively. The health, nutrition, \nand education sectors have direct impacts on the lives of young children in poor families. These \nsectors were funded centrally during the former Soviet Union (FSU) and, until its final years, \nwere relatively protected. The Kyrgyz Republic had achieved a high level of education and had \ndeveloped  extensive  education  and  health  care  networks  before  independence.  However, \nbudgets, coverage, and quality of services have declined in recent years. Rural and urban \ndisparities are widening. Scarce resources are concentrated in the major cities and towns; \ntraining and supplies reach remote, impoverished rural health posts and schools last.  \n \n4.  Social indicators of the Kyrgyz Republic show the effects of increased poverty and \ndeclining  public  investment  in  child  development.  Achieving  by  2015  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) to which both the Kyrgyz Republic and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) subscribe may be at risk. Major efforts will be required especially to meet the \ntargets  of  reducing  infant  mortality  rate  (IMR)  and  under-five  mortality  rate  (U5MR)  and \nsustaining universal primary education by arresting the problem of increasing dropouts. The \nProject seeks to help the Government improve health, nutrition, and psychosocial development \nof young children and attain the MDGs. The Project framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n5.  The IMR remains high in the Kyrgyz Republic despite almost universal literacy and high \nlevels of attended births (95% of deliveries take place at health facilities supervised by trained \nmedical staff). Government statistics in 2001, which use the Soviet definition of live birth, show \nthat IMR was 21.7 and U5MR was 29.7. According to the 1997 Demographic and Health Survey \n(DHS) that used World Health Organization (WHO) standard definitions, IMR was 61.3 and \nU5MR was 72.3. Both the Government and DHS figures on the IMR and U5MR were much ", "2 \nhigher than the European average.1 The DHS figures place the Kyrgyz Republic in the group of \nlower human development countries with weak health care systems and lower literacy. \n   \n6.  Children\u2019s nutrition status has deteriorated since independence. In addition to a general \nincrease in poverty, the reduced availability of food subsidies targeted at children and meals \nformally provided through preschools has eliminated key nutrition sources for young children. \nThe collapse of the production and distribution of fortified food has increased micronutrient \ndeficiency.  According  to  DHS,  the  prevalence  of  stunting,  which  is  highly  correlated  with \nreduced cognitive performance, reached 29% and 30% in Osh and Naryn oblasts (provinces), \nrespectively. The prevalence of iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) is increasing. The Government \nreports  that  the  number  of  IDD  cases  has  increased  by  8-10  times  in  the  last  10  years. \nInternational research has clearly and consistently demonstrated that an average of 13 IQ \npoints is lost in iodine-deficient children living in areas where goiter is endemic.2 Iron deficiency \nanemia (IDA) is also highly prevalent: 48.5% of children below 3 years of age and 38% of \nwomen  were  anemic  in  1997.  Women  with  IDA  face  a  higher  risk  of  pregnancy-related \ncomplications that contribute to higher maternal mortality ratio. Mothers with IDA give birth to \ninfants whose psychomotor and cognitive skills are diminished or developmentally delayed.  The \nschool performance of children with IDA, is also affected. Among adults, productivity losses due \nto IDA have been estimated at 5-17% depending on the kind of work. Overall, micronutrient \nmalnutrition in developing countries costs at least a 5% loss of gross domestic product.3 \n \n7.  Many young children have not benefited from psychosocial development opportunities \nand  primary  school  dropouts  are  increasing.  Prior  to  independence,  preschool  institutions \ncomprising full-day nurseries and kindergartens offered a package of child nutrition, health, and \neducation services free of charge to more than a third of preschool-age children. However, \nmany preschool institutions have been closed down. Rural areas are especially hard hit. Only \none third of operating preschools are located in rural areas. The surviving preschools have \nstarted  charging  small  fees  to  compensate  for  reduced  state  support  and  have  become \nunaffordable to poor children. In 2000, only 7.1%, 3.6%, and 2.3% of preschool-age children in \nJalal-abad, Osh, and Naryn, respectively, attended preschool. Parents have not been able to \nreplace  the  functions  of  preschools.  Parents  in  rural  areas  lack  knowledge  of  child  care \npractices to stimulate children\u2019s psychosocial development, and have little time or inclination to \ncommunicate or play with their children. A study conducted during Project preparation revealed \nthat many young children in the Kyrgyz Republic are left unattended for most of the day. Four- \nyear olds were with some caretaker only for 5 hours a day and spend the rest of the day alone.  \n \n8.  Before,  extensive  preschool  coverage  resulted  in  children  joining  the  formal  school \nsystem already able to read and write. In contrast, most children now enter grade 1 unprepared \neither academically or socially. The average age at school entry has declined: in 1991, 27,200 \n6-year-olds entered grade 1, and in 1999, 40,000 did. This suggests that grade 1 is increasingly \nserving as kindergarten and a school preparation class. The result is added pressure on grade 1 \nteaching. According to the Government\u2019s 2000 Education for All Report, the primary school \ncompletion rate is only 85%. This lower-than-expected completion rate is at least partly due to \nlack of preparation for school at entry. Children who attend preshool are more likely to complete \nprimary school and show higher school achievement. \n                                                 \n1  The average IMR of Europe is 12.8 in 1996 (WHO).  \n2 Bleichrodt, N. and M.

", "3 \n9.  The condition of poor young children and their families and deteriorating public services \nfor children require effective early childhood development (ECD) programs. Investment in ECD \nbenefits not only children and their families, but also society as a whole. Society benefits from \ngreater productivity in later life. Investment in ECD can reduce the needs for and cost of future \nsocial welfare programs, and public expenditures in the health care system. Children who \nbenefit from health and nutrition interventions and preschool experiences are more likely to \nenroll and persist in school, to be healthier, to need fewer social protection or criminal justice \nservices, and to earn higher incomes as adults. Research shows a positive correlation of ill \nhealth as a child, with physical impairments and health problems later in life, all of which are \nburdens on health services. ECD also addresses an important societal concern of equity. ECD \nhas larger impacts on deprived children than better-off children and contributes to narrowing the \ndifferences  in  development  at  the  beginning  of  life  among  children  of  various  economic \nbackgrounds. This is especially important for the Kyrgyz Republic and other FSU countries \nwhere economic inequality is widening.  \n \n10.  ECD also has positive impacts on women, especially mothers, since mothers and child \nhealth are closely intertwined. Improvements in child health results in less time needed to care \nfor sick children and reduced costs of health care. Aside from the obvious benefits of improved \nhealth for both mothers and children, ECD interventions, especially increased availability of \npreschools, enable women to access economic opportunities outside the home. Provision of \npreschools releases women from full-time child care, and gives them opportunities to participate \nin the labor market and earn incomes. Reduction of IDA among pregnant women reduces \npregnancy-related risks and contributes to overall improvement of women's health. \n \n11.  The Government has long recognized the importance of child development. The Law on \nProtection  of  the  Kyrgyz  People\u2019s  Health  clearly  stipulates  the  state\u2019s  responsibility  for \nprotecting  children\u2019s  right  to  living  conditions  required  for  sound  physical,  cognitive,  and \npsychosocial development, and the obligation of citizens to take care of children\u2019s health, \nphysical, cognitive, and psychosocial development. Investing in ECD is directly relevant to the \nbasic human development needs of the Kyrgyz Republic as stated in the Government\u2019s poverty \nreduction strategy and also the Education Strategy for 2010.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n12.  While the problems associated with ECD in the Kyrgyz Republic are challenging, most of \nthem  have  well-established  remedies.  The  Project  will  select  the  most  cost-effective \ninterventions in the areas of health, nutrition, and early childhood care and education consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Policy on Education (2002), and Policy for the Health Sector (1999). ECD is a \npriority subsector under the education policy. The health policy prioritizes support for primary \nhealth care that benefits the poor and identifies priority, cost-effective health interventions. The \nsector/subsector analysis is presented in Appendix 2.   \n \n13.    Child Health.  According to Government data, the major causes of infant deaths are \nacute respiratory infections and diarrhea\u2013diseases that were responsible for 38.2% and 12.4% \nof all infant deaths in 2001. Causes of under-five deaths follow the same pattern. Child deaths \ndue to these diseases can be prevented by quality primary health care. In the Kyrgyz Republic, \nprimary health care providers consist of FAPs (primary health care posts) and Family Group \nPractices (FGPs). FAPs have feldshers (primary health care workers) and midwives and are \noften the only health care providers located in remote villages. FGPs have medical doctors in \nplace. They provide primary health care services to people and supervise the FAPs. While \nFGPs  have  received  assistance  under  other  projects  in  recent  years,  FAPs  have  been ", "4 \nneglected. Therefore, to reduce child mortality in rural areas, improving the FAPs will be crucial. \nImmunization  is  arguably  the  most  important  means  to  prevent  infant  deaths.  The  Kyrgyz \nRepublic has maintained universal immunization for children, relying on vaccines funded by the \nGovernment of Japan and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization. However, this \nassistance is due to end in 2004. Given its fiscal constraints, the Government will need interim \nfinancial support to sustain universal immunization. The Integrated Management of Childhood \nIllnesses (IMCI) program was developed by WHO and UNICEF to efficiently reduce the severity \nof major childhood illnesses and deaths due to illnesses among children less than 5 years old. \nIMCI has been piloted in three raions, but not on a large scale for lack of resources. \n \n14.  Child Nutrition. The most effective means to prevent IDD and IDA is to promote use of \niodized salt and iron fortification of staple food.4 Since 2001, ADB has been administering a \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  project  for  improving  nutrition  of  women  and \nchildren.5 The Project has contributed to production of iodized salt and iron-fortified wheat flour \nof  good  quality,  enforcement  of  the  universal  salt  iodization  law,  and  increased  public \nawareness  of  the  importance  of  using  iodized  salt  and  fortified  food.  The  Government \nintroduced the National Program for Reduction of IDD for 2003-2007 (approved 9 December \n2002) to accelerate actions to prevent IDD. The main objectives of the program are to (i) \nachieve compulsory salt iodate fortification and refortification; (ii) increase the percentage of the \npopulation  consuming  iodized  salt  to  95%;  (iii)  prevent  industrial  salt  use  for  human \nconsumption; (iv) conduct social mobilization for IDD prevention; and (v) train primary health \ncare providers on IDD prevention, diagnosis and treatment. \n \n15.  Early  Childhood  Care  and  Education.  Expanding  early  childhood  education  is  a \npriority  of  the  Government  Strategy  on  Education  Development  to  2010.  The  number  of \npreschools will be increased and the curriculum will be reformed. The FSU model of full-day, \nfull-service nurseries and kindergartens is expensive and beyond the financial means of the \nGovernment and poor families. Pedagogy used at the conventional preschools also need to be \nupdated and made more child-centered. Several alternative preschool programs have been \npiloted  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic6  and  the  Project  will  support  systematic  development  of \nalternative preschools in the community or at home to extend the access of poor children to \npreschools,  and  improve  grade  1  teaching.  The  combination  of  increasing  preschool \nopportunities and better grade 1 teaching will contribute not only to children\u2019s psychosocial \ndevelopment  but  also  to  increasing  the  primary  school  completion  rate  and  learning \nachievement.  Even with increased availability of preschool programs, families will continue to \nbe the primary child care providers, and the quality of child care at home will have significant \nimpacts  on  child  development.  Therefore,  the  Project  will  also  aim  to  improve  child  care \npractices at home. \n \n16.  External  Assistance.  Several  international  organizations  are  supporting  different \naspects  of  ECD,  focusing  on  either  child  health  or  programs  (Appendix  3).  Major  partner \norganizations  including  the  World  Bank,  UNICEF,  WHO,  and  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency were regularly consulted during project preparation.   \n                                                 \n4 Dietary diversification through a broad-based food policy and supplementation for high-risk groups remain options in \nan integrated strategy for eliminating micronutrient malnutrition, but both have limitations. \n5 ADB. 2001.

Lessons  Learned  and  Special  Features.  The  Project  has  three  distinct  design \nfeatures:  integrated  ECD,  multisectoral  and  decentralized  implementation,  and  community-\nbased  interventions.  Health,  nutrition,  and  education  are  interactive  determinants  of  child \ndevelopment, and programs to optimize child development should integrate these features. The \nintegrated ECD interventions have been found to be more effective than isolated single sector \ninterventions. Most ECD interventions by the Government or international organizations remain \nisolated and narrowly focused pilots, small in scale, often covering only a few raions. The \nProject will consolidate successful pilot interventions as an integrated package of ECD services, \ntake  them  to  scale,  and  coordinate  multiple  agencies  to  achieve  tangible  effects.  The \nexperience of ADB-financed ECD projects in the Philippines shows that strong leadership at the \nnational  Government  level  is  crucial  in leading  a  multisectoral  ECD  project,  and  also  that \nactivities entrusted to local governments are more likely to progress than those handled by the \ncentral government. The President\u2019s office has been selected to be the Executing Agency to \nlead this multisectoral Project and to coordinate different ministries. A substantial part of project \nactivities  will  take  place  at  the  ayil  okmotu  (AO,  village  authority)  level.  The  AO  and  the \ncommunity will be entrusted with organizing community-based preschools. AO and community \ninitiatives will be supported by providing grants from a village initiative fund (VIF). This model is \nbased on a positive experience of the discretionary fund under the ADB-financed Social Service \nDelivery Project in the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n18.  The goal of the Community-Based Early Childhood Development Project is to improve \nhealth, nutrition, and psychosocial development of children between birth and 8 years of age in \nthe 12 poorest raions. Specific objectives are to (i) reduce IMR and U5MR, (ii) reduce IDD, (iii) \nreduce  IDA  both  among  children  and  pregnant  women,  and  (iv)  improve  psychosocial \ndevelopment of preschool children. The Project will contribute to attaining the MDGs to reduce \nIMR and U5MR and achieve universal primary education. The Project will also contribute to \nincreasing women\u2019s economic opportunities outside the home by improving children\u2019s health \nand nutrition status, and increasing access to preschool programs.  \n \n19.  The Project has three components. The child health and nutrition component will (i) \nensure universal coverage and quality of immunization, (ii) improve case management for major \nchildhood morbidities, (iii) improve functioning of primary health care posts, (iv) universalize \nconsumption of iodized salt, and (v) introduce behavioral change to prevent IDA. The early \nchildhood care and education component will (i) improve access of poor children to preschool \nprograms including state-run preschools and community preschool programs, (ii) improve the \nquality of grade 1 education, and (iii) improve the quality of child care at home. The capacity \nbuilding component will (i) develop the capacity of local governments and communities to plan, \nimplement,  and  monitor  ECD  activities;  and  (ii)  improve  data  collection  and  monitoring  of \ndevelopment indicators for young children between birth and 8 years of age from the community \nto the central Government levels. \n \n20.  The Project will target poor children between birth and 8 years of age. Using poverty \nstatistics, the Project will target the 12 poorest raions with poverty rate above 69% in 2001.7 \n                                                 \n7  Ak-Tala, At-Bashy, Jumgal, Kochkor, and Naryn raions in Naryn oblast; Chatkal, Toktokul and Toguz-Toro in Jalal-\nAbad oblast; and Alay, Kara-Khulja, Chon-Alay, and Nookat raions in Osh oblast. \n ", "6 \nAbout 148,000 children are expected to directly benefit from the integrated interventions in the \nproject raions, while about a million children will benefit from immunization in the entire country. \nThe profile of the project raions are in Appendix 4. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n1.  Child Health and Nutrition \n \n21.  Expected outputs of the component are (i) sustained universal immunization of children \nin the country, (ii) expanded use of IMCI, (iii) universal use of iodized salt by households, and \n(iv) rehabilitated primary health care facilities.  \n \n    a.  Sustaining Universal Immunization of Children \n \n22.  The Project will support the purchase of vaccines and procure equipment necessary for \nmaintaining an effective cold chain from participating raion centers (i.e., principal towns) to \nprimary health care facilities. The Government will be accountable for maintaining the cold chain \nfrom the vaccines' point of entry to the country to the raion centers, and for ensuring an \nadequate  supply  of  power  to  primary  health  care  facilities.  Considering  the  importance  of \nimmunization  in  containing  IMR  and  infant  morbidity,  the  Project  will  finance  the  national \nrequirements of vaccines for an extended program of immunization (EPI) from 2005 to 2008, \nand provide refrigerators at primary health care facilities and the Sanitary and Epidemiological \nServices.   \n \n    b.  Reducing Child Mortality \n \n23.  IMCI  reduces  the  mortality  of  children  between  6  months  and  5  years  of  age  by \naddressing the common causes of child mortality\u2013acute respiratory infections and diarrhea\u2013and \nmitigating malnutrition. The Project will support the training of primary health care workers \n(feldshers) on IMCI in the project raions. In addition to the main clinical and nutrition module, the \ncare module that will promote psychosocial development of children will be included as part of \nIMCI training. Piloting of the care module has started with support of UNICEF and WHO, and \nthe Government will adopt the IMCI care module by the end of 2003. While training the FGP \ndoctors on IMCI will be primarily the Government\u2019s responsibility, the Project will provide for \ntraining about 25 doctors in the targeted raions. The Project will also support essential drugs \nand medical supplies required by FAPs to implement IMCI. Essential drugs at FAPs have been \nin short supply, although the situation is gradually improving. The Government has introduced \ncorrective  measures  including  the  cofinancing  of  essential  drugs  by  the  Mandatory  Health \nInsurance Fund (MHIF). However, it will take the Government some time to allocate sufficient \nfunds for the MHIF, and to increase the availability of pharmacies in rural areas. Therefore, the \nProject\u2019s support is necessary as an interim measure.  \n \nc.  Reducing IDD and IDA \n \n24.  The Project will support the national program for reduction of IDD. It will finance social \nmobilization, especially monitoring of iodized salt by communities and retailers. The Project will \nprovide  salt  testing  kits,  and  information,  education,  and  communication  (IEC)  materials.  \nCommunity salt monitoring has been piloted in Naryn oblast by the Swiss Red Cross and the \nJFPR project. It has increased awareness of the importance of iodized salt and the availability of \niodized salt in the market. Support for IDA reduction consists of iron supplements\u2013iron tablets \nfor children and women and syrup for young children\u2013as part of the essential drug package, and ", "7 \nIEC activities. IEC will promote diets that would increase iron intake and absorption, discourage \nbehaviors that inhibit iron absorption, and advocate implementation of nutrition policies. IEC \nmaterials on IDD and IDA which were developed under the JFPR project and by other aid \nagencies will be utilized in this Project.  \n \nd.  Rehabilitation of Primary Health Care Facilities \n25.  Equipment  and  facilities  in  FAPs  are  in  serious  disrepair  and  affect  the  quality  of \nservices for children. The maintenance of the primary health care facilities is the responsibility of \noblast  governments,  which  often  lack  financial  resources.  This  subcomponent  will  aim  at \nrehabilitating the FAPs, which need major repair. It is estimated that 120 FAPs at most, need \nmajor repair. The Project will also finance the essential equipment in FAPs, which need to be \nreplaced in the project raions.  \n    \n  2.  Early Childhood Care and Education \n \n26.  Major outputs of this component are (i) new community or home based preschools, (ii) \nimproved grade 1 education, (iii) improved child care practices at home, (iv) revised standards \nfor preschool programs, and (v) rehabilitation of currently operating kindergartens and a limited \nnumber of grade 1 classrooms. Community or home-based preschool programs will serve not \nonly as instrument to impart psychosocial stimulation activities to children but also as efficient \nmeans to health and nutrition education.  \n \na.  Community and Home-Based Preschools \n27.  This subcomponent will help communities to develop cost-effective preschool programs.  \nThe  Project  will  support  (i)  child  and  family  coordinators (CFCs)  who  will  work  with  AOs, \nmobilize communities, and initiate preschool programs in the community; (ii) one resource \nkindergarten per raion as a resource center for community or home-based preschools; (iii) \nproviding  instructional  materials  and  supplies  necessary  for  children's  activities,  and  other \nnecessary supplies to AOs; and (iv) training for teachers of kindergarten preparatory courses, \nand community or home-based preschools, and monitoring their performance. The Ministry of \nEducation and Culture (MOEC) will select one resource kindergarten in each raion among \ncurrently operational kindergartens. The resource kindergartens will have complete lending \nlibraries  of  reference  materials  for  other  kindergartens  and  community  or  home-based \npreschools and will be used as training sites. Kindergartens that will serve as hub kindergartens \nto  advise  and  supervise  a  group  of  community  or  home-based  kindergartens  will  also  be \nprovided with learning materials and in-service teacher training.    \n \n    b.  Improving Grade 1 \n \n28.  This subcomponent will improve the quality of grade 1 in primary schools, and ensure \nuniversal enrollment and completion of grade 1. Textbooks and learning materials are in short \nsupply in many primary schools, and many grade 1 teachers have not received regular refresher \ntraining. The Project will provide (i) complete sets of textbooks and learning materials for grade \n1 pupils and (ii) in-service training for grade 1 teachers.  \n                         \n                        c.  Improving Child Care Practice \n \n29.  This subcomponent aims at improving child care practice especially parents\u2019 knowledge \nof and skills in child care. The Project will support development of an IEC strategy for better ", "8 \nchild care, production of IEC materials, and training. IEC will focus on building awareness of \nfamily impacts on ECD, feasible activities at home for psychosocial development (e.g., verbal \ninteraction, reading, and play), and nutrition education. This component, complementing the \nactivities for reducing IDD and IDA, will provide a comprehensive package of key nutrition \nmessages covering exclusive breastfeeding, complementary feeding, use of iodized salt, and \nintake of iron supplements. Parent education materials will be developed by a working group \ncomprising representatives of MOEC, Ministry of Health (MOH) and other experts, assisted by \nan international consultant.      \n \n    d.  Developing Standards for Preschool Programs \n \n30.  Standards  and  regulations  for  preschool  programs  have  not  been  updated  since \nindependence  and  need  major  updates.  MOEC  proposes  to  develop  new  standards  for \npreschool  programs  including  state  kindergartens  and  nurseries,  community/home  based \npreschools, preparatory courses, and preschools run by nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nor the private sector that meet world standards. The Project will support the development of \nstandards by providing an international consultant for the advisory TA to work with the working \ngroup appointed and led by MOEC. \n \ne.  Rehabilitating of Grade 1 Classrooms and Kindergartens \n \n31.  Some schools and kindergartens need repair to create a safe learning environment for \nchildren.  The  Project  will  support  rehabilitation  of  selected  grade  1  classrooms  and \nkindergartens. About 30 kindergartens and 50 grade 1 classrooms will need major repair.  \nMOEC will select the 50 schools based on geographic accessibility, quality of teachers, and \npossibility of offering preparatory courses for preschool children. The 30 kindergartens for major \nrehabilitation  work  will  be  selected  based  on  the  need  for  repair  and  capacity  to  support \ncommunity-based preschools. \n \n3.  Capacity Building \n32.  This component will develop the capacity of AOs and committees to improve ECD by \nplanning and managing ECD activities, and strengthen the Government capacity to monitor \nindicators  of  child  development.  The  outputs  of  the  component  are  (i)  community-based \nactivities  for  improving  ECD  financed  by  the  VIF,  (ii)  strengthened  capacity  of  AOs  and \ncommunities to plan and carry out activities for child development with the assistance of CFCs, \nand (iii) improved monitoring of child development indicators. \n \na.  Strengthening AO\u2019s Capacity \n \n33.  The AO\u2019s capacity to plan and implement project activities will be strengthened by \ntraining on management and by CFCs. CFCs will be selected on a competitive basis from the \nlocality and hired on a contractual basis for 2 years and supported by the Project. Their main \ntasks are to (i) assist the AO to develop work plans for project activities carried out at the AO \nand  community  levels,  (ii)  mobilize  and  help  communities  establish  a  child  development \ncommittee and identify needs of their children, (iii) initiate new preschool and child activities, (iv) \nmanage the IEC campaign, (v) review the project activities conducted at AO or community \nlevels, (vi) monitor performance indicators and prepare project progress reports. The outline \nterms of reference of CFCs is attached as Appendix 5. CFCs are meant to support the AOs and \ncommunities  during  the  initial  stage  of  the  Project,  which  requires  intensive  community \nmobilization and IEC activities. After 2 years, CFCs' work will be transferred to existing social ", "9 \nworkers or another category of workers, which the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection \n(MLSP) is piloting in a few raions and is planning to introduce more widely in the future. \nOtherwise, AOs will support the CFCs from their own budget. The Project will support training of \nCFCs and social workers on community mobilization, essential topics on child development, \nproject activities and administration. \n \nb.  Village Initiative Fund \n \n34.  The VIF subcomponent will provide the AO and communities with financial resources \nand opportunities to address their specific needs in ECD. Funds will be made available over 5 \nyears for the projects in the project raions that will have a direct, tangible, and positive impact on \nchildren between birth and 8 years of age. Communities will be eligible to apply for VIF financing \nthrough AOs; each application should not exceed $5,000. Project raions or  groups of AOs that \nwish to implement a project that will benefit children across different AOs can apply for VIF \nfinancing through the raion administrations. In this case, each application should not exceed \n$15,000 dollars. The community will share 20% of the project cost: 10% in cash and 10% in \nkind.  The  operational  framework  of  the  VIF  is  presented  in  Appendix  6.  VIF  will  become \noperational within 3 months of project effectiveness. \n \n    c.  Monitoring ECD Indicators \n \n35.  MLSP has been conducting the Social Passport Survey since 2000. It is an annual \nsurvey  to  update  the  database  on  the  economic  status  of  each  household  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic.  Social workers posted at AOs visit each household to collect data on household \nincome and other welfare indicators, which are used to facilitate targeting of social assistance \nprograms. A module on ECD indicators will be added to the standard Social Passport Survey \nquestionnaire under the Project, which will allow key project output indicators for ECD to be \nregularly monitored. The data from AOs will first be compiled at the raion Social Protection \nDepartment; sent on to the oblast administration, which will compile the data for the oblast; and \nthen submitted to the central Government. The results of analysis will be fed back to the \nconcerned ministries, oblast and raion administrations, and AOs. To ensure quality survey data, \nthe Project will support data management training for social workers in the targeted raions and \nMLSP staff in the raion, oblast, and central Government who are responsible for management of \nsurvey data. The Project will also assist the Government in computerizing such data. Once the \nquality of data enumeration is improved, each of the participating raions and oblasts will be \nprovided  a  computer,  if  the  respective  government  agencies  agree  to  bear  recurrent  and \nmaintenance costs for the computers and data management. \n \n36.  Apart from the regular social passport monitoring, surveys will be conducted at the \nbeginning and end of the Project to establish the baseline and end values of ECD indicators. \nThe survey will be designed with TA to allow rigorous evaluation of the outcome of project \ninterventions.  \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n \n37.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $13.470 million equivalent, including duties \nand taxes. Of the total, $5.383 million or 40% is the foreign exchange cost, including $0.226 \nmillion in interest charges; and $8.087 million equivalent (60%) represents the local currency \ncosts. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 7.

Financing Plan \n \n38.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of $10.5 million equivalent from \nits Special Funds resources. The amount will finance 100% of the foreign exchange cost and \n$5.117 million equivalent of the local currency cost or about 63% of the local currency cost. The \nloan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The remaining $2.970 \nmillion equivalent as counterpart financing or 22% of the total cost will be contributions of \nGovernment  ($2.570  million  for  all  taxes  and  local  recurrent  costs  for  maintenance  of \nrehabilitated facilities, equipment, and furniture) and of communities ($0.400 million for financing \nmaterials and labor for small civil works, taxes and duties, and operation and maintenance of \nproject facilities). The Borrower will be the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total Cost   Percent \nExchange   Currency    \n     \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)           5,383           5,117          10,500             78 \nGovernment                  0           2,570            2,570             19 \nCommunities                   0              400               400               3 \nTotal           5,383           8,087          13,470           100 \n \n39.  The provision of financing for the local currency cost of $5.117 million equivalent is \nconsidered justified under ADB\u2019s local currency financing policy.8 Despite progress made in \nfiscal consolidation, public finances have not reached a stage to generate budgetary savings to \nsupport  the  public  investment  program  (PIP).  Further,  the  underdeveloped  financial  sector \nprevents  the  Government  from  mobilizing  domestic  private  savings;  consequently,  the \nGovernment relies on external assistance to finance almost the entire PIP. A relatively large \nexternal support for local currency costs will be necessary until the Government overcomes \n                                                 \n8   ADB.1995.

The proposed budget is consistent with the Government's \nPIP disbursement limits. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n40.  The President\u2019s office will be the Executing Agency. The President\u2019s office will have \noverall responsibility for project coordination and implementation, and will appoint a project \ndirector among its senior officials.  An interagency steering committee will meet at least once in \n3 months, and more often as necessary, to provide overall policy guidance, monitor the project \nactivities and outputs, and advise and decide on policy-related matters. The steering committee \nwill consist of representatives of the President's office, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), MOH, \nMOEC, MLSP, and Ministry of Local and Self Government. A project management office (PMO) \nwill be established under the President\u2019s office but physically located outside the office to be \nmore accessible to stakeholders. An oblast project coordination office (PCO) in each of the \nthree participating oblasts will be established within 1 month of project effectiveness. The PMO \nwill  oversee  day-to-day  project  management  and  implementation  and  be  responsible  for \nprocurement. PCOs will be situated in the oblast governments and assist local governments \n(raion administrations and AOs) in planning and monitoring project activities. The PMO in \nBishkek will be (i) staffed by domestic consultants including a project manager, procurement \nspecialist,  and  a  financial  specialist  and  an  assistant;  and  (ii)  also  assisted  by  domestic \nconsultants  on  primary  health  care/IMCI,  early  childhood  care  and  education,  community \nplanning and mobilization, evaluation and information system. Each of the three PCOs will be \nstaffed with domestic consultants including a project coordinator, an assistant, and a part-time \narchitect or engineer. The Project will support the salary of the consultants, office equipment \nand operational costs. The PMO will be assisted by an international management specialist on a \ndeclining basis over the project implementation period. The structure of project management is \nin Appendix 8. \n \n41.  MOH will be responsible for implementing the child health and nutrition component. \nMOEC will be responsible for the early childhood care and education component while MOEC \nand MOH will be jointly responsible for the subcomponent on improving child care practice. \nMLSP will be responsible for collecting data and monitoring ECD indicators through the regular \nSocial Passport Survey, and will, in consultation with AOs, develop a plan for sustaining CFC\u2019s \nwork without the Project\u2019s support. AOs will be responsible for organizing community and home-\nbased  preschool  programs,  and  mobilizing  and  assisting  communities  in  developing  and \nimplementing projects to be financed by the VIF.   \n \n  2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n42.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years starting in January 2004 and ending in \nDecember  2008.  In  the  first  year,  priority  will  be  given  to  making  arrangements  with  the \nconcerned communities to start rehabilitation works in the spring of 2004 and be completed \nbefore  the  fall  of  2005.  Due  to  extreme  winter  weather  in  most  project  areas,  physical \nrehabilitation work will occur from April to November. Other first year activities will comprise \nfielding consultants; recruiting CFCs, and training AOs, CFCs, and social workers; reviewing \nbaseline data for monitoring and evaluation (M&E), detailed project planning; setting up imprest \naccounts for loan and counterpart funds; raion and community workshops for key implementing \nagents (AOs, teachers, health personnel, social workers); and developing preschool program \nstandards. The modest start will allow the PMO to develop and test project procedures, build ", "12 \ncapacity within local government units and enlist the cooperation of concerned communities in \nexecuting the works. The process of tendering for rehabilitation of structural components will be \nbased on surveys and detailed work plans. Monitoring of civil works and services to each \ncommunity will be done by each ministry through their affiliated departments in the oblast \nadministrations, assisted by AOs, CFCs, and communities. The implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 9. \n \n43.  An implementation plan for the first year covering all project activities will be submitted to \nADB before project inception. Subsequently, the PMO will prepare an annual implementation \nplan covering all project activities by September of each year that will allow the Government to \nallocate counterpart funding in the following year\u2019s budget. The required information will include \n(i) a time schedule for all tasks, the duration and linking of tasks, and their estimated cost; and \n(ii) a list of projected contract awards and disbursements.  \n   \n  3.  Procurement \n \n44.  Procurement for ADB-financed goods and services will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The PMO will be responsible for overall procurement and, in \nconsultation  with  MOH,  MOEC,  and  MLSP  for  procurement  relevant  to  each  ministry. \nEquipment will be procured by (i) international competitive bidding (ICB) for contracts valued at \n$500,000 or more; (ii) international shopping (IS) for contracts below $500,000; and (iii) local \ncompetitive bidding (LCB) or direct purchase for items valued at  less than $50,000. ICB will be \nused for civil works contracts over $1,000,000. Due to the small and scattered nature of the \nphysical facilities to be rehabilitated, civil works will be carried out through LCB. Major repairs \nwill be managed by the PMO through contractors, and minor rehabilitation will be handled by \ncommunities  under  the  VIF  with  20%  of  costs  shared  by  communities  in  kind  and  cash.  \nEssential drugs will be procured through ICB, and other health and education supplies through \nIS. Furniture and some equipment and learning materials (largely classroom/FAP furnishing, \ntextbooks and teaching support materials) are produced locally and will be procured through \nLCB. Domestic production capacity and quality are satisfactory and prices are reasonable. It is \nunlikely that foreign suppliers will be interested in these small contracts. MOH and MOEC will \ndevelop distribution systems for essential drugs and textbooks, respectively, acceptable to ADB, \nthat will ensure transparent distribution of these goods to project beneficiaries, before disbursing \nthe loan funds for them. Indicative procurement packages are reported in Appendix 10. \n \n45.  Vaccines  will  be  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member  countries  through  UNICEF  under \narrangements satisfactory to MOH and ADB. Each purchase of vaccines will be subject to \nADB\u2019s approval. The Kyrgyz Republic has been procuring EPI vaccines through UNICEF. Such \nprocurement is the safest and most economical method for developing member countries at \npresent. WHO controls the quality of vaccines procured through UNICEF. ADB\u2019s research \nshowed that procurement of vaccines through by UNICEF is cost-effective.9    \n   \n  4.  Training \n \n46.  The project will provide substantial in-country training, totaling about 300,000 person- \ndays. The training schedule has been designed to bring training as close as possible to actual \nproject activities. Training for health care personnel on IMCI, and in-service training for grade 1 \nand kindergarten teachers will take place in the oblasts; training for CFCs, social workers, \nfeldshers, and community or home-based preschool teachers will take place in the raions; and \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2001. Immunization Financing in Developing Countries and the International Vaccine Market. Manila. ", "13 \ntraining for parents will take place in the communities. The summary of training activities is \npresented in Appendix 11. Training on IMCI will be conducted by the State Medical Institute for \nContinuous Training, that has most of IMCI trainers as its staff and has been the main training \ninstitute for IMCI. Service providers for training the CFCs and social workers, and teachers of \nkindergartens, preparatory courses, and community or home-based preschools, and grade 1 \nteachers will be selected by the PMO in coordination with MLSP and MOEC, in accordance with \nprocedures acceptable to ADB and agreed-upon terms of reference (Appendix 12). MLSP will \ntrain its data management staff at the raion, oblast, and central levels on data management and \nanalysis, and social workers on Social Passport Survey data enumeration.  \n \n  5.  Consulting Services \n \n47.  Consulting  services  by  firms  or  individuals  financed  by  ADB  will  be  selected  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Consulting services financed \nunder the loan will be for project management and implementation support. A total of 665 \nperson-months of individual consulting services (23 international and 642 domestic) will be \nrequired in management, finance, procurement, early childhood care and education, primary \nhealth care/IMCI, community planning and mobilization, evaluation, information system, and \narchitecture/engineering. Approximately 300 person-months of domestic consultant inputs will \nbe allocated to PMO and PCO support services. International and domestic individual consulting \nservices will be engaged in accordance with the procedure satisfactory to ADB. The individual \ninternational  consultants  will  assist  PMO  staff  to  develop  appropriate  systems  for  project \nmanagement and train the PMO and PCO staff on project planning and management. The \ninternational consulting services will be provided on a declining basis over the project period. At \nthe end of each year, the PMO and ADB will review the performance of both domestic and \ninternational consultants. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 13.  \n \n6.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n48.  The President\u2019s office will set up the PMO. Before loan effectiveness, key consultants \nthat will staff PMO will be recruited: a project manager, financial specialist, and procurement \nspecialist.  The  Project  will  retroactively  finance  the  costs  incurred  after  the  conclusion  of \nappraisal (18 June 2003) and related to advertising  posts, shortlisting, and placing the staff in \nthe PMO, and purchasing necessary office equipment not exceeding $200,000. However, ADB \nconcurrence in advance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the \nrelated expenditure under the Project, or to finance the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n49.  An imprest account will be established after loan effectiveness to facilitate disbursing the \nloan  proceeds.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements between MOF and ADB. The PMO will \nopen the account in a commercial bank, selected by the Government and ADB. The initial \ndeposit in the imprest account will be 10% of the loan amount, or the estimated expenditures for \nthe next 6 months whichever is lower.  PCOs will assist oblast, raion, and AO administrations in \nformulating  project  activities  for  the  5-year  implementation  of  the  Project,  complete  with \nexpenditure estimates for each year of implementation. These budgets will be reviewed and \nupdated quarterly. All budgets will be reviewed and approved by MOF before implementation. \nApproved expenditures will be recorded at source by the PCOs and the PMO. The PMO will \napprove  and  supervise  all  disbursement  arrangements.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures ", "14 \nprocedures  will  be  followed  to  liquidate  the  imprest  account  and  to  reimburse  individual \npayments that do not exceed $3,000 equivalent. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n50.  The  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation.  The  PMO  will  consolidate  the  reports  and  will  particularly  address \nimprovements in ECD indicators and the institutional development aspects of the Project. The \nquarterly progress reports will have information on the physical progress of rehabilitation work, \nstatus of ECD, compliance with loan covenants, organizational and financial issues, and actions \ntaken  or  planned  to  remedy  them,  and  the  proposed  program  of  activities  and  expected \nprogress in the next 6 months. The PMO will also report annually, the results of M&E based on \nthe community survey conducted by social workers. Within 3 months of substantial physical \ncompletion of the Project, PCOs and the PMO will submit to ADB a project completion report \nthat  will  cover  the  details  of  implementation,  cost,  M&E  activities,  and  other  information \nrequested by ADB. \n \n51.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  recording  project  expenditures  based  on  its  own \nexpenditures and reports of expenditures carried out by PCOs. The PMO will report project \nexpenditures monthly to MOF, with copies to ADB, with quarterly and annual summaries. The \nimprest account, SOE records, statement of accounting policies; statement of income (cash \nreceipts), statement of expenses (cash payments), cash flow statement; and notes to financial \nstatements will be audited at the end of each calendar year in accordance with the Guidelines \nfor  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  and  the  Loan \nAgreement. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n52.  An  integrated  system  of  data  collection  and  analysis  will  be  developed  to  monitor \nprogress in achieving the project objectives. Specifically the system will provide the Government \nand ADB with the data and indicators to monitor project inputs, processes, and outputs as \nprovided  in  the  project  framework  and  in  key  performance  indicators  and  to  assess  the \ntechnical, social, and economic impacts of the Project. The system will be sufficiently specific to \naddress the evaluation needs of the Project. Additionally, the project management information \nsystem will monitor the implementation of specific components; furnish evidence of project fund \noutlays, including the entity that received the funds, and the completion status of the funded \nactivities. ECD indicators will be collected through the Social Passport Survey. The Project will \nalso conduct baseline and evaluation surveys. The surveys will be designed with the help of \ninternational  and  domestic  evaluation  specialists  for  the  advisory  TA,  to  enable  rigorous \nevaluation of the project outcome.  \n \n53.  The Project will conduct qualitative monitoring of project activities. MOH, MOE, and \nMLSP will be involved in monitoring the technical quality of activities in the component under \ntheir responsibility. Technical specialists of each ministry will visit project sites together with \nPMO or PCO staff and report the findings to each ministry, PMO, and PCO. There will be \nindependent monitoring and evaluation for the subprojects funded by VIF. At the end of years 2, \n3 and 4 of project implementation, at least 10% of randomly sampled subprojects will be \nreviewed and evaluated by a third party financed by the Project.   \n \n54.  Within 4 months of loan effectiveness, the PMO will develop and submit to ADB for \nreview and concurrence a detailed implementation plan for M&E and for preparing baseline ", "15 \ninformation. Annual reports will be submitted to ADB through the PMO throughout project \nimplementation;  these  reports  will  include  indicators  of  project  completion,  delivery,  and \nbenefits.   \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n55.  ADB and the Government will carry out project supervisory missions every 6 months. \nBefore each ADB visit, the President\u2019s office will prepare an updated progress report. ADB \nreviews will examine records of M&E activities and meet with central and local Government, \ncommunity leaders and Project beneficiaries. Within 2 years after project effectiveness, the \nGovernment and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review to (i) examine the scope, \ndesign, implementation arrangements, and other relevant issues in light of the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment of ECD strategies and policies; (ii) assess the Project's progress and achievement \nof  the  objectives;  (iii)  identify  problems  and  constraints; and  (iii)  recommend  any  required \nmodifications, restructuring, and reallocations.   \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n56.  The  TA  for  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Community-Based  Early  Childhood \nDevelopment aims to assist the Government in filling the major institutional and capacity gaps to \npursue  an  effective  ECD  program  in  the  long  run.  The  main  objectives  are  to  help  the \nGovernment (i) develop an updated, comprehensive strategy for ECD; (ii) develop an M&E \nsystem for ECD; and (iii) introduce parent education models. Activities planned under each \nobjective follow. (i) A task force will be constituted to develop an ECD strategy for the country, \nwith  the  help  of  international  specialists  that  have  expertise  in  global  and  domestic  ECD \npolicies. (ii) Data on ECD are scattered across different sector surveys and some indicators are \nsimply not available. To monitor the status of ECD and rigorously evaluate the effects of \nprojects/programs on ECD, proper information systems will be developed. An evaluation study \nframework will also be designed at the beginning of the Project to evaluate the effect of the \nproject interventions. (iii) Parents play the most important role in ECD, especially for children \nbelow 3 years of age. The TA will support developing a comprehensive package of messages, \ntraining, and materials for parents' education on ECD. \n \n57.  The TA will last for 18 months starting in January 2004. It will finance 13 person-months \nof international consultants, and 54 person-months of domestic consultants with expertise in \nECD, preschool standards, and project evaluation and monitoring. ADB will engage individual \nconsultants  for  the  ECD  team,  and  a  consulting  firm  for  monitoring  and  evaluation,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A consulting firm will be selected \nby quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) and simplified proposals will be invited from short \nlisted firms. The Executing Agency for the TA is the President's office. TA consultants will work \nclosely with the PMO, and their outputs will be submitted to both PMO and ADB. The total cost \nof the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent comprising $378,000 in foreign exchange cost \nand $222,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will provide $500,000 on a grant basis from \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, to cover the entire foreign \nexchange costs and $122,000 equivalent of the local currency expenditures. The Government \nwill provide the remaining $100,000 equivalent in kind. Outline terms of reference and cost \nestimates are in Appendix 14. \n ", "16 \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n1.  Poverty Reduction \n \n58.  Investment in ECD results in improved human capital in the long run and high future \nincomes of individuals. The investment is especially effective among children from economically \ndisadvantaged  families.  ECD  investments  targeting  poor  children  will  help  prevent \nintergenerational transfer of poverty. Large regional variations in the poverty rate and availability \nof poverty data at the raion level enabled the Project to adopt efficient geographic targeting of \nthe poor population. The 12 targeted raions are the poorest, with poverty rates above 69% as of \nJuly 2002. Activities under the Project are also pro-poor, focusing on primary health care and \ncommunity-based activities in rural areas. Except for support for immunization, which covers the \nentire child population in the Kyrgyz Republic, the activities concentrate at community-level \ninterventions, including support for the FAPs the first health care contact point for the rural poor \nand preschool activities in rural communities. The combination of efficient geographic targeting \nand selecting pro-poor interventions will ensure that more than 50% of the project beneficiaries \nare poor.   \n \n  2.  Strengthening Local Self-Governance \n \n59.  The AO is the lowest elected political body. At the level of the AO and the community, \nmany Project activities will be carried out and substantial training will be given. This focus on the \nAO and the community will help improve governance by bringing activities closer to the intended \nbeneficiaries, and improve efficiency by giving the communities opportunities to design and \nimplement through the VIF, projects catering to their specific needs. The experience with an \nADB-financed  ECD  project  in  the  Philippines  also  shows  that  activities  entrusted  to  local \ngovernments are more likely to progress than those handled by the central Government.    \n \n  3.  Improved Effectiveness and Efficiency of Services \n \n60.  Some services in the health sector, such as IMCI, have not achieved their full potential \ndue to remaining gaps in training and insufficient supply of essential drugs. The Government \nhas been able to mobilize resources for training FGP doctors on IMCI, but has not been able to \ntrain feldshers, who are the first health care contact for the rural population. Essential drugs \nnecessary for implementing IMCI have not reached all primary health care providers. Filling \nthese gaps, the Project is improving the effectiveness of existing services at minimal additional \ncosts. \n \n61.  The Project will also improve the cost-efficiency of preschools. Replicating existing state-\nrun  kindergartens  is  not  a  financially  viable  option  for  MOEC\u2019s  endeavor  to  increase  the \ncoverage of preschools. The annual expenditure per child in state-run kindergartens ranged \nfrom $60 to $100 equivalent in 2000. The Government budget that covers between 65% and \n90% of the expenditure, depending on the oblast, mostly pays for teachers\u2019 salary.  By contrast, \nthe Project expects that the annual recurrent expenditure per child of a community or home-\nbased  preschool  will  be  $30-40  following  an  initial  $1,500-2,000  investment  in  equipment, \nfurniture, and learning materials.   \n \n \n ", "17 \nB.  Analysis of Economic and Financial Sustainability \n \n62.  The Project is expected to directly benefit more than 148,000 children between birth and \n8 years of age in the 12 target raions. Over 20 years, the beneficiaries will total 484,000 children \nand 368,000 pregnant women. In addition, the immunization subcomponent will cover all infants \nin the Kyrgyz Republic. The economic benefits of the Project will come from (i) savings in health \nexpenditures due to fewer hospital visits, (ii) savings in education expenditures due to reduced \ngrade repetition, (iii) productivity gains from an increased life-span and reduced mortality, (iv) \nproductivity gains from improved education achievements especially through reduced dropout \nrates,  (v)  productivity  gains  from  reduced  IDA,  and  (vi)  social  protection  benefits  through \nimproved social behavior. The estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project \nis 63.6%.  Because of practical difficulties in estimating them, the calculation did not include the \nbenefits in (vi), or the benefits to children outside the project raions but who benefit through \nimmunization and improved national ECD policies. The actual return will be higher when the \nexcluded benefits are factored in. The EIRR is highly sensitive to assumptions made, especially \nexternal factors, such as the macroeconomic situation of the country, which will determine \neconomic opportunities for the population. Therefore, even if the Project succeeds its achieving \nobjectives, the high EIRR may not materialize due to external economic factors. The economic \nanalysis is presented in Appendix 15.   \n \n63.  The Project avoids introducing new functionaries in the Government payroll or facilities \nto  be  sustained  by  the  Government  budget.  The  Project\u2019s  recurrent  costs  that  cover \nmaintenance  of  facilities,  equipment,  supplies  (vaccines,  essential  drugs,  and  education \nmaterials), training, and monitoring will represent less than 1% of the national health and \neducation budget over the forecast period of 20 years.10 The Project encourages cost sharing \nby the AO and the community. If their contributions are considered, the percentage will further \ndecrease.  Major  recurrent  costs  are  vaccines  and  essential  drugs.  The  Government  has \ncommitted itself to financially sustainable procurement of vaccines. Essential drugs will be \nincreasingly  made  available  as  the  MHIF  improves  its  performance  and  more  pharmacies \nbecome available in rural areas. Therefore, sustaining the project activities beyond the project \nperiod is expected to be within the fiscal capacity of the Government.  \n \nC.  Environmental and Social Measures \n1.  Environment \n \n64.  The  Project  will  not  have  significant  adverse environmental  effects. Civil  works  are \nlimited to rehabilitating of existing health facilities, kindergartens or grade 1 classrooms in rural \nareas. The Project will not procure potentially hazardous medical supplies such as syringes and \nneedles. The Project will finance mostly preventive medical activities, which leave almost no \nmedical wastes. The Government also has a regulation on medical waste management. Project \nsupervision  will  closely  monitor  the  issue  of  medical  wastes  in  health  facilities  during \nimplementation and introduce corrective measures if a problem is found.   \n   \n2.  Social Analysis \n \n65.  The Project does not have any adverse social impacts. A social analysis undertaken \nduring project preparation involved various stakeholders. In addition to surveys, national, oblast, \n                                                 \n10 It is assumed that the share of the Government budget in the total gross domestic product (GDP) remains the \nsame and that the GDP grows on average 4%. ", "18 \nand raion task forces have identified problems, opportunities, and available resources through \nconsultation with stakeholders and workshops. The Project will need no land acquisition or \nresettlement. Current ECD indicators including preschool attendance or health-seeking behavior \ndo not demonstrate gender inequality. Vulnerability, ECD indicators, and access to basic social \nservices in the Kyrgyz Republic vary by region, residence (rural or urban), and economic status. \nThere is no evidence that ethnicity determines vulnerability or disadvantage in access to basic \nsocial services. The summary poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 16.     \n \nD.  Risks \n \n66.  The Project involves almost no technical risk. The selected interventions have been \ntested and proven effective in the Kyrgyz Republic and internationally. The most significant \nchallenge is the efficiency of implementation involving multiple ministries, both national and local \ngovernment  bodies,  and  the  AO.  The  AO  became  an  elected  body  only  recently,  and  its \ncapability  to  plan  and  manage  a  project  is  untested.  To  ensure  strong  leadership  and  to \neffectively coordinate policies and activities among different ministries, the President\u2019s office has \nbeen selected as the Executing Agency. The President\u2019s office has constituted the steering \ncommittee comprising representatives of concerned ministries and project oblasts to provide \npolicy  guidance.  The  Project  has  made  substantial  provisions  for  supporting  AOs  through \ntraining and CFCs during the first 2 years of project implementation.  \n \n67.  Another challenge is sustainability of the services after project completion. Maintaining \nquality  primary  health  care  and  preschool  programs  requires  Government  commitment  to \nallocate sufficient funds to carry out the ECD strategy and sector reforms. Supplies of essential \ndrugs  and  vaccines  will  be  the  major  items  of  recurrent  costs.  The  Project  will  help  the \nGovernment plan for these supplies.   \n   \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n68.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:   \n \n1.  Child Health \n69.  The Government will ensure that FGP doctors and feldshers will be trained on IMCI, \nbased on the IMCI training module including the care module, in accordance with the training \nplan to be agreed upon with ADB.   \n \n70.  By the end of year 3 of project implementation, MOH will develop a plan satisfactory to \nADB  for  sustaining  universal  immunization  coverage,  IMCI  training  for  relevant  health \npersonnel, and supplying of essential drugs after the Project.   \n \n2.  Early Childhood Care and Education \n \n71.  MOEC  will  ensure  that  training  of  grade  1  teachers,  kindergarten  teachers,  and \ncommunity-based  preschool  teachers  will  be  conducted  by  appropriate  institutions  in \naccordance with a set of training guidelines to be developed under the TA.   \n ", "19 \n72.  MOEC will ensure that it will adopt the standard for preschools acceptable to ADB within \na year after loan effectiveness.    \n \n3.  Capacity Building \n \n73.  Within 4 months after loan effectiveness, the President\u2019s office will adopt a project M&E \nplan acceptable to ADB. The key performance indicators agreed upon by the Government and \nADB will be used to evaluate the achievements and impact of the Project. \n \n74.  A baseline survey for the target raions will be carried out within 12 months after loan \neffectiveness, and its findings will be used to confirm or modify, in consultation with ADB, the \nbase values and target values for the Project's key indicators. A survey will be carried out not \nlater than 6 months before the end of the implementation period to evaluate the achievements \nand impacts of the Project. The Government and ADB will conduct a joint midterm review of the \nProject in year 3 of project implementation. \n \n75.  The  President\u2019s  office  will  ensure  that  the  AOs  will  select  the  CFCs  through  a \ncompetitive selection process and recruit CFCs on a contractual basis for the first 2 years of  \nproject implementation based on criteria agreed upon with ADB. \n \n76.  By the 18th month of the CFCs\u2019 recruitment, both MLSP and AO will jointly develop a \nplan on how to sustain the work of the CFCs without financial support from the Project and \nsubmit the plan for ADB\u2019s consideration. \n \n77.  MOF will promptly allocate and transfer to MHIF the budgetary resources needed for the \nhealth insurance scheme covering children below 16 years of age. \n \n78.  The President\u2019s office in coordination with MLSP, will ensure that CFCs and social \nworkers will be trained by appropriate institutions selected according to criteria agreed upon with \nADB. \n \n79.  MLSP will ensure that the computers provided to the raions and oblasts will be utilized in \ncompiling  and  analyzing  the  data  of  the  Social  Passport  Survey  and  information  on  ECD \ncollected as part of the survey in the project raions. The Government will ensure that computers \nare operated and maintained, and necessary allocations are made in a timely manner for the \nrecurrent costs. \n \n80.  The Government will enter into an agreement, acceptable to ADB, with the recipient \ncommunities before disbursing funds from the VIF to finance the subprojects. The Government \nwill  ensure  that  not  less  than  20%  of  each  subproject\u2019s  costs  are  borne  by  the  recipient \ncommunity:10% in cash, 10% in kind. \n \n81.  The final decision on award of funds from the VIF will be made by the PMO, with the \nassistance of the VIF evaluation subcommittee, and in accordance with criteria agreed upon by \nthe Government and ADB. \n   \n4.  Environment   \n \n82.  By year 2 of implementation, the Government in consultation with ADB will review the \nstatus of handling of medical wastes at FAPs, and introduce corrective measures if a problem is \nfound.   ", "20 \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n83.  The Government will ensure that the project director has been appointed and that key \ncontractual staff for the PMO have been selected. \n \n84.  The President\u2019s office will issue the order that will specify the responsibility of MOF, \nMOEC, MOH, MLSP, and project oblast administrations, with respect to project implementation. \n \n85.  MOF will issue an order with respect to the establishment of the VIF.   \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n86.

Introduction \n \n1.  Early childhood development (ECD) is inherently multisectoral because young children \nare holistic in their development. Their physical, emotional, social, and cognitive development \nare intertwined and cannot be addressed in isolation. Health, nutrition, and education have \ndirect impacts on the lives of young children in poor families. These services were funded \ncentrally  during  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU)  and,  until  its  final  years,  were  relatively \nprotected. However, recent years have seen declines in budgets, coverage, and quality of \nservices. Scarce resources are concentrated in major cities and towns.Training and supplies \nreach remote impoverished health posts and schools last, even though poverty rates are higher \nin rural areas than urban areas. \n \nB.   Health, Nutrition, and Early Childhood Development \n2.  The  officially  reported  infant  mortality  rate  (IMR)  fell  during  the  1980s  and  1990s. \nNevertheless, the IMR remains high for a country with almost universal literacy and health care \ncoverage and places the Kyrgyz Republic in the league with poor countries with a weak health \ncare system. According to government statistics for 1983-1996, the IMR declined from 40 to 26 \nper 1,000 births in 1996. However, the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 1997, which \nfollowed the definitions of the World Health Organization (WHO), reported an IMR of 61 per \n1000 live births based on the international standard definitions over the period 1992-1997 \n(Table A2.1). Official statistics reported IMR at 21.7 per 1,000 live births in 2001. \n \nTable A2.1: Infant and Child Mortality Rates by 5-Year Periods \n(per 1,000 live births) \n \nYears  Period  Neonatal  Post-  Infant Mortality  Under-5 \nPreceding   Mortality  Neonatal  Mortality \nDHS  Mortality \n0-4  1992-1997  31.6  29.7  61.3  72.3 \n5-9  1987-1992  34.6  36.2  70.8  79.2 \n10-14  1982-1987  26.8  55.2  82.0  99.0 \nDHS = Demographic and Health Survey. \nSource: 1997 DHS of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n3.  The 1997 DHS also found that 25% of children were severely or moderately stunted, \nreflecting chronic malnutrition; and 3% were severely or moderately wasted, indicating acute \nmalnutrition. Children aged 6-23 months were less well nourished, reflecting poor diets and \nillnesses during weaning.  Among schoolchildren 52% exhibited iodine deficiency in a 2000 \nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  study.  The  cognitive  deficits  caused  by  iodine \ndeficiency during pregnancy and early childhood are severe and permanent. Since the collapse \nof the FSU, regulatory frameworks for iodized salt have failed. The supply of iodized salt is \nlimited. Some salt marketed as iodized is not iodized, or does not meet minimum standards; \nconsequently, consumer confidence and demand have been weakened.   \n \n4.  The problem of child malnutrition and reduced food consumption is severe in rural and \nremote areas, especially in eastern and southern regions. In rural areas only tea, bread, and \npotato are available for ordinary meals. Rates of moderate and severe anemia among children \nand pregnant women have risen. Anemia among pregnant women was 16% and almost one ", "26  Appendix 2 \nquarter of children under the age of three suffered from moderate or severe anemia in 1997. A \n2001 UNICEF study in Naryn reported a rate above 40%. \n \n5.  Health sector investments have not grown sufficiently to meet these challenges. Health \ncare expenditures as a percentage gross domestic product (GDP) and as a percentage of \ngovernment  expenditures  have  declined  from  3.9%  to  2.1%  and  from  13.6%  to  11.5%, \nrespectively (Table A2.2). Expenditures on FAPs (primary health care posts), which service the \npoorest and most remote communities, have lagged slightly behind other categories of local \nexpenditure.  The  real  declines  in  community-based  health  services  seriously  threaten  the \ndevelopment of the most vulnerable children. Central Government expenditures have risen \nmore  than  local  expenditures  despite  reforms  that  are  explicitly  intended  to  decentralize \nresponsibilities for service delivery and financing. The Mandatory Health Insurance Fund (MHIF) \nwas set up in 1996 to improve helath care financing.  In 1997, the fund began to receive  \ninsurance  preimums  and  finance  health  care  services.    However,  MHIF  has  encoutered \ndifficulties. The revenue collecated was much lower, and received insufficient transfers from the \nGovernment.  \n \n \nTable A2.2: Health Care Expenditure Analysis, 1995-2000 \n \nItem  1995  1996  1997  1998  1999  2000 \nHealth Sector as % of GDP            3.9             3.1             3.2             2.8             2.3             2.1 \nTotal Government  Total     4,611      5,202      6,696      7,298      9,312    11,308 \nExpenditure (som million)  Central     3,270      3,746      5,657      6,128      7,950      9,697 \n Local     1,913      1,873      2,136      2,386      2,809      3,407 \nHealth Sector  Total        627         733         977         962      1,126      1,296 \nHealth Sector Share (%)  Total          13.6           14.1           13.7           13.2           12.1           11.5 \nPrimary health care (PHC)  Local          50.3           58.8           65.9           70.5           90.8           99.3 \n     Polyclinics, Dispensary,              40.2           47.9           55.1           58.9           75.8           83.5 \n     Ambulance Station\uf02a \n     Primary Health Care Posts          10.1           10.9           10.8           11.6           15.0          15.8 \nPHC/Health Sector (%)   Local          10.3           11.1           11.2           10.7           11.8          11.4 \nFAP/Health Sector (%)  Local            2.1             2.1             1.8             1.8             1.9            1.8 \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n \nC.  Education, Child Care, and Early Childhood Development \n6.  Following  independence,  many  kindergartens  were  closed  down  and  preschool \nenrollment declined overall from approximately 40% (for children 1-6 years old, with lower rates \nfor the youngest children and much higher rates for older children) to less than 10% nationwide \n(Table A2.3). Recent studies estimated a rate of approximately 16% in urban areas, 8% in raion \n(district) centers, and less than 5% in rural villages. Of the 468 kindergartens still in operation, \n63% serve cities and towns, 37% serve rural areas, generally raion centers rather than villages. \nThese  data  capture  only  state-supported  full-day  kindergartens  and  a  handful  of  private \nkindergartens.  Preschool  services  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  are  few  and \npreschool enrollments would not be materially altered if such schools were included.   \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nTable A2.3: Kindergartens and Enrollment, 1990-2000 \n \nItem  1990  1991  1920  1993  1994  2000 \nKindergarten Enrollment (\u2018000)        151.5       144.7     143.2       92.2   58.9  45.6 \nNumber of kindergartens (no.)     1,696    1,604     1,380  998     639    468 \n \n7.  With  the  earlier  extensive  provision  of  preschool  and  early  childhood  education  in \nkindergartens, the majority of the children joining the school system already knew how to read \nand write. In contrast, most children now enter grade 1 without the necessary preparation for \nschool. In addition, the reduced availability of meals in schools and closure of milk kitchens and \npreschools, especially in rural areas, aggravated the problems of poverty. Cost recovery for \nmeals and introduction of fees for enrollment in preschools have eliminated a key component of \nthe social safety net for young children and their family. \n \n8.  The lack of kindergarten facilities may result in overcrowding the early grades of primary \nschool, particularly in rural areas. Before independence, when kindergartens provided care for 1 \nto 6-year-olds, most children started grade 1 at 7 years of age. In 1991, 27,200 6-year-olds \nattended grade 1; in 1999, 40,000 6-year-olds were attending grade 1, suggesting that families \nare using grade 1 as kindergartens.   \n \n9.  Primary  school  enrollments  continue  to  rise  and  new  schools  are  being  built  to \naccommodate them (Table A2.4). UNICEF reports a 98% gross enrollment rate for primary \nschools (grades 1-4). For secondary schools, gross enrollment ratios are 75% for males and \n83% for females.  \n \n \nTable A2.4 :Primary School Enrollment, 1993\u20132002 \nItem  1993  1994  1995  1997  1998  2000  2002 \nChildren in Primary  378.6  385.9  470.7  470.9  469.5  457.2  469.5 \nEducation (\u2018000) \nPrimary and General  1,832  1,840  1,843  1,889  1,918  1,975  2,014 \nSchools (no.) \nSource:  Statistics Department of the MOEC. \n \n10.  Expenditures for primary education and preschool have not kept pace with GDP or \noverall budget growth (Table A2.5). Between 1995 and 2000, total government expenditures \nincreased by a factor of 2.45, while the education sector increased by a factor of 2.15, and its \nshare of the total budget decreased from 23.1% to 20.3%. Local primary school expenditures \ndropped  from  36.6%  of  the  sector  budget  to  32.4%.  The  proportion  of  the  sector  budget \ndedicated to kindergartens fluctuated, but did not drop substantially.   \n \n11.  The availability of textbooks, new or old, has become a chronic problem. Teachers are \noverworked, underpaid, and undertrained; less than 10% receive in-service training annually \ndespite a national target of 20%. Most remote rural teachers have had no training in a decade. \nMany  classrooms  and  schools  need  maintenance  and  new  equipment.  Playgrounds  are \ndangerous, with broken equipment and multiple hazards. Buildings, heating systems, electrical \nequipment,  toilets,  and  sewerage  systems  are  in  serious  disrepair.  These  conditions  are \ndisincentives to school attendance; only about 85% of enrolled children attend daily. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.5: Education Sector Expenditure Analysis, 1995-2000 \n \nItem    1995  1996  1997  1998  1999  2000 \nEducation as % of GDP             6.6           5.2            4.9           4.9           4.1            3.5 \nTotal Government  Som    4,611    5,202     6,696    7,298    9,312   11,308 \n  Expenditures  Million  \nEducation Sector  Total    1,065    1,223     1,514    1,682    1,991     2,203 \nEducation Sector   Total         23.1         23.5          22.6         23         21          19.5 \n   Share of Govt (%) \nExpenses  Central       216       346        518       581       638        740 \nLocal       849       877        996    1,100    1,353     1,563 \nKindergarten  Total         74.2         78.0          87.1       107.6       131.5        143.8 \nPrimary (grades 1-4)a  Local       311.3       312.1        344.1       363.5       437.9        506.0 \nPrimary   Education    Local         36.6         35.6          34.5         33.0         32.4          32.4 \n   Sector Share (%)a  \nKindergarten Sector Share (%)  Total           6.9           6.3            5.7           6.3           6.6            6.5 \na Estimates on local data.

The lack of preschools for poor children is detrimental to ECD, but the sustained support \nfor state-run kindergartens is not an effective or efficient public investment. It is a good private \ninvestment for the families that can afford the subsidized kindergarten fees, but those same fees \nmake the services inaccessible for the children who really need them. Average family costs for \nkindergarten are more than 5 times the cost of primary school, vary among the target oblasts, \nand are markedly higher in urban than in rural areas. Despite family payments, government \ncosts per child for kindergarten are extremely high and the effectiveness of the programs is low. \nMeasuring psychosocial development of young children is very difficult and there is a debate on \nthe most reliable indicators. Nevertheless, research has shown no improved performance on \nachievement tests for most children from kindergartens with the notable exception of those \nsupported  by  an  NGO,  Step  by  Step.  Returns  on  public  investment  in  present  state-run \nkindergartens are likely to be marginally positive over the long term. However, returns on \ninvestment for poor children would be between 1:3 and 1:7 according to international research.  \n \n \nTable A2.6: Costs for Kindergarten and Grade 1, 2000 \n  Government Costs   Family Cost   Family Cost \n  per Child per Year   per Child per Year   per Child per Year \n  in Kindergarten   in Kindergarten  in Grade 1-4 \nOblast  (Som)  (Som)   (Som)  \n  Total  City  Raion  Total  Total \nNational Average  3,530  4,296  2,579  1,070  206 \nJalal-Abad  2,088  3,331  1,255     585  126 \nOsh  3,079  3,068  2,735  1,554  209 \nNaryn  3,430  3,580  3,310     226  226 \nSource: Ministry of Finance.  \n \n13.  Less comprehensive, less expensive preschool models would likely produce similar \nbenefits and high returns if children from impoverished families participated. Communities and \nfamilies  have  different  needs;  in  some,  seasonal  child  care  is  an  urgent  need;  in  some, \nextended families still care for young children; in others, women are single parents and have ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nconstant need for child care. It is urgent that poor families and children obtain access to high- \nquality care and school preparation. \n \nD.  Summary \n \n14.   ECD services in the Kyrgyz Republic are in short supply, often of poor quality, and \ninaccessible to most poor families because of distance or fees.  Investments in these services \ndo not reliably reach areas where poor families predominate, and when they do, fees and costs \nare insurmountable barriers to families and children who need the services most and would \nbenefit most from them. Targeted investments to reach poor young children, including in remote \nrural communities, would yield significant long-term benefits. Improved capacities, which are \ndefined  in  the  early  years,  would  make  investments  in  the  education  system  much  more \nefficient.

The CFC will be supervised on site by the AO, but will report to the \nproject coordinator for the oblast.  \n \n4.  Training for CFCs will be conducted in the raion. Social workers will be included in the \ntraining. If in 2 years it is determined that the work has positive results and a dedicated staff \nperson is needed, then AOs may finance the position. Otherwise, the work of the CFC is \nexpected to be absorbed by the social worker, or another category of workers, whom MLSP is \npresently trying out in a few raions and planning to introduce more widely in the future. \n ", "  Appendix 6  35 \nVILLAGE INITIATIVE FUND \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n1.  The Village Initiative Fund (VIF) will be used to finance community projects that will have \ntangible positive impacts on child development in the communities, and to support minor repairs \nof FAPs (primary health care posts), preschools, or grade 1 classrooms. The goal of the VIF is \nto improve child development in the communities. The objectives are to (i) build local capacity to \nidentify the needs of children and opportunities for improving child development; (ii) promote \nparticipation of local communities in early childhood development activities; and (iii) support the \npolicy of decentralization to local administration. \n \n2.  Eligible applicants are the communities under the aiyl okmotus (AOs) in the 12 project \nraions, and the 12 raion administrations. The communities may choose to partner with any other \norganization, including a nongovernment organization (NGO), in preparing applications and \nimplementing a project. \n \nB.  Selection Criteria and Procedures \n \n3.  Grants will be provided to fund minor rehabilitation or maintenance of primary health \ncare facilities, preschools, and grade 1 classrooms. Major repair involving repair of roofs will be \ncontracted out by the project management office (PMO). \n \n4.  The VIF will also support projects that will have a positive impact on the development of \npoor children.  A few examples of such projects follow \n \n(i)  preparing facilities for community-based preschools, \n(ii)  creating a parent resource center, \n(iii)  developing  a  community  care  and  home  visitation  program  for  children  with \nspecial needs, \n(iv)  growing vegetables to improve children\u2019s diets, \n(v)  producing learning materials for children, \n(vi)  creating a library for children, \n(vii)  rehabilitating water supply systems to provide safe drinking water for children, \nand  \n(viii)  improving hygiene in the community to prevent waterborne diseases. \n \n5.  Communities will submit applications to the AO, which will ensure that the application is \nin order and will send it to the PMO via the oblast project coordination office (PCO). If the \nproposed project covers children across different AOs in a raion, the raion administration will \nconsult the concerned AOs before submitting an application to the PMO via the PCO. Specific \nsteps are involved in the procedure: \n \n(i)   The PCO will train the child and family coordinator (CFC) to assist the community \nin preparing proposals. \n            (ii)  The  community  or  group  of  communities  will  develop  a  proposal  with  the \nguidance or assistance of the CFC. In developing a proposal, the community \nmay choose to work with a school, FAP, women\u2019s group, or an NGO.   \n(iii)  The raion administration will develop a proposal in consultation with the relevant \ndepartments, AOs, and CFCs \n(iv)  Community proposals must be endorsed by the AO  ", "36  Appendix 6 \n(v)  A community proposal is submitted directly to the PCO by the AO, and a raion \nproposal by the raion administration. \n(vi)  The proposal is reviewed by the PCO who will consult with raions, education, \nhealth,  and  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Protection  (MLSP)  officials  for \nguidance, if necessary and \n(vii)  The PMO, assisted by a VIF evaluation committee to be formed under the project \nsteering committee, makes the final award of the funds.  \n \n6.  The PMO and PCOs will assist the AO, CFC, and community to organize information \ndissemination meetings, train them to write proposals, and provide consultation and necessary \ninformation.  \n \n7.  Applications will be reviewed once in 3 months by the evaluation subcommittee under \nthe steering committee. The subcommittee will comprise the PMO, PCO, and representatives of \nthe Ministry of Health, Education and Culture, Finance and MLSP. The evaluation will be based \non the criteria agreed upon in the Project, including expected impact of the project on targeted \nchildren and participation of the community in planning and implementation.  \n \n8.  For minor rehabilitation of facilities, the maximum amount of each grant will be $2,500. \nFor child development projects, the maximum amount will be $5,000 for a community project, \nand $15,000 for a project that covers children in more than one AO. The community will \ncontribute at least 10% of the total project cost in kind, and another 10% in cash.    \n \n9.  The PMO and the receiving community will make an agreement on a grant. After the \nreceiving community deposits its cash contributions to the project bank account, the PMO will \npay the grant in one or several tranches, depending on the requested amount.  \n \n10.  Concerned ministries, through their counterpart departments in oblast administrations, \nwill be responsible for supervising of the rehabilitation of facilities financed by the VIF. The \nsupervising  bodies  will  submit  quarterly  monitoring  reports  to  the  PMO.  The  AO  will  be \nresponsible for submitting progress and completion reports on the VIF funded projects in the \ncommunities to the PCO, which will compile the reports and then send the consolidated form to \nthe  PMO along with a quarterly report.  \n \n11.  When notified by the AO of the completion of the grant project, the supervising bodies \nwill check the state of the project, and submit final reports for each individual grant to the \nMinistry of Finance and the PMO.   \n \n12.  Independent monitoring and evaluation of at least 10% of randomly sampled projects will \nbe conducted at the end of years 2, 3 and 4 of project implementation.     \n \n13.  The PMO can stop payments for a grant project if violations or major differences from \nthe originally agreed upon plan are found.  \n \n14.  The PMO, the PCOs, the President\u2019s office, or oblast and raion administrations have the \nright to randomly inspect the use of VIF by visiting rehabilitated facilities or project sites.   \n \n \n \n \n ", " \n  A ppendix 7  37 \nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN BY SOURCE \n($ \u2018000) \n  Total  Government and Communities  ADB Financed \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total  %  Foreign  Local  Total  %  \nExchange  Currency  Cost  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Share  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Share \nInvestment Costs                       \n A.

Methodology and Approach \n \n1.  This economic analysis was undertaken in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. The analysis is based on the \nproject interventions outlined in the project framework (Appendix 1). It describes the economic \nrationale  and  target  beneficiaries,  provides  with-and  without  project  analysis,  establishes \neconomic benefits and economic costs, and compares the economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) with the economic opportunity cost of capital, which is assumed to be 10%.1 Sensitivity \nanalysis tests changes in the EIRR with modified assumptions about project costs and benefits. \nThe period of analysis covers 20 years period carried out in constant 2002 dollar prices.    \n \nB.  Project Objectives and Scope \n \n2.  The project objectives and components are described in the main text. The three project \noblasts of Jalal-Abad, Naryn, and Osh have a population of 2.9 million (69% of the country\u2019s \npopulation), of whom about 2 million live in rural areas. The Project will improve access to \nquality health and education services for the rural population, thereby directly or indirectly \nimproving the health and education status of some 484,440 children living in the 12 poorest \nraions of the target oblasts, including children born during the 20-year period. \n \n3.  Improvements in infant and child mortality in the target raions are based on targets \nconsistent with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for the Kyrgyz Republic by 2015. \nThe Project aims to contribute to the MDG targets of reducing by two thirds the infant mortality \nrate (IMR) from 61.3 (1997) to 20.8 (2015) and the under 5 mortality rate (U5MR), from 72.3 to \n24.6 in the same period.   \n \nC.  Rationale for Investment and Approach \n \n4.  The economic rationale for investing in early childhood development (ECD) is strong. \nInvestment in ECD will improve an individual\u2019s future prospect of earning. The improvement will \ncontribute to individual wealth and poverty reduction, increase future productivity of the labor \nforce, and lead to economic development. Numerous studies demonstrate that improved health, \neducation, and poverty that impact the first several years of children\u2019s development are directly \nrelated to improved adult and societal productivity. The early years of human life are a critical \nperiod  during  which  the  foundations  for  healthy  physical,  cognitive,  emotional,  and  social \ndevelopment are laid. Neuroscience has revealed the importance for brain development of a \nchild\u2019s health, activities, and experiences in the first few years of life. Children who are deprived \nof appropriate stimulation, care, and nutrition during their early years often develop poorly and \ncannot reach their full potential. Although not always impossible, it is very difficult and expensive \nto alter the outcomes of this critical period in later life. Some deficits, for example, iodine and \niron deficiency, cause irreversible damage. \n \n5.  Investment in ECD benefits not only children and their families, but also society as a \nwhole.  Society  benefits  from  ECD  through  greater  productivity  in  later  life.  The  child  care \nprograms  free  up  women  to  work  and  thus  increase  the  availability  of  the  labor  force. \nInvestment in ECD is also preventive and can reduce the need for and costs of social welfare \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. ", "52  Appendix 15 \nprograms, and public expenditures in the health care system. Children who benefit from health \nand nutrition interventions and preschool experiences are more likely to enroll and persist in \nschool, to be healthier, to need fewer social protection or criminal justice services, and to earn \nhigher incomes as adults. Research shows a positive correlation of ill health as a child, and \nphysical impairments and health problems later in life, all of which are burdens on health \nservices.  ECD also addresses the important societal concern of equity. ECD is known to have a \nlarger impact on deprived children than better-off children. Therefore, ECD will contribute to \nnarrow  differences  in  development  among  children  who  come  from  various  economic \nbackgrounds. This is especially important for the Kyrgyz Republic and other former Soviet Union \ncountries where economic inequality is widening.  \n \n6.  Integrated  Approach.  Health,  nutrition,  education,  and  home  care  are  interactive \ndeterminants of child outcomes, and therefore programs to optimize child development should \nintegrate these features. Experience shows that integrated ECD interventions are more effective \nthan isolated single sector intervention. Young children are very susceptible to infections and \ndiseases, and this vulnerability is greater when a child is malnourished. Malnutrition, illness, or \nneglect during childhood has immediate and long-term effects on cognitive development and \nlearning achievement through loss of concentration, apathy, and reduced activity. Children who \nare malnourished or neglected during early childhood are more likely to delay enrollment in \nprimary  school;  they  are  likely  to  perform  less  well  and  to  learn  less  than  well-nourished \nchildren.  \n \n7.  Community-Based Approach. The preschool system in the former Soviet Union was a \ndistinctly center-based approach that prevented the involvement of communities and parents in \nchild development, and imposed centrally planned standardized curriculum. The center-based \napproach was an expensive model. The existing state-run kindergartens are not a financially \nviable option for endeavor the Ministry of Education and Culture\u2019s (MOEC) to increase the \ncoverage of preschool. The annual expenditure per child in a kindergarten in Jalal-Abad was \n$60-100 equivalent in 2000. The Government budget covers between 65% and over 90% of the \nexpenditure, depending on the oblast, and pays mostly for teachers' salaries. By contrast, the \ncommunity-based  preschool  programs  introduced  under  the  Project  expects  the  per  child \nannual recurrent expenditure of a community/home-based preschool to be $30-40 in addition to \nthe initial $1,500-2,000 investment on equipment, furniture, and learning materials. With the \nProject, household expenditures on health care due to child morbidity will decline. Increased \naccess to preschool programs may increase total expenditures on preschool programs by both \nhousehold and government in the end, but will substantially reduce the expenditure per child \nwho benefits from preschool programs.   \n \nD.  Cost Benefit Analysis \n \n8.  The quantitative cost-benefit analysis for the Project follows the methodologies outlined \nin ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. The analysis uses domestic prices \nas the numeraire. The economic opportunity cost of capital was assumed to be 10% (footnote1). \nSensitivity analysis tested changes in the to EIRR with modified assumptions about project \ncosts and benefits. The period of analysis covered 20 years and was carried out in constant \n2002 dollar prices. To simplify the calculation, the analysis focused on benefits from the Project \nin  the  12  project  raions,  while  some  project  activities  including  immunization  and  policy \ndevelopment will benefit children across the country.  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 15  53 \n  1.  Economic Costs \n \n9.  Base investment costs are in constant 2002 dollar prices, with domestic prices used as \nnumeraire. Taxes and duties account for 19% of the project costs. Incremental recurrent costs \nare calculated for the 15 years following the 5-year project implementation period and are \nestimated at about 119% of project costs. These costs are high relative to many health projects \nbecause the loan will cover the purchase of vaccines, equipment, and supplies for universal \nimmunization of the country\u2019s entire child population. These costs for immunization are the main \nelement of recurrent costing. Cost items in foreign exchange are converted to domestic prices \nusing a shadow exchange rate factor of 0.9. \n \n  2.  Economic Benefits \n \n10.  Major benefits from the Project include cost savings to the health sector due to reduced \nchild morbidity and mortality, increased earnings contributed to society by the increased lives \nsaved, and the impacts on the education system and the increased earnings resulting from an \nadditional year of schooling. \n \n    a.  Cost Savings \n \n11.  Cost savings that accrue to the health sector from lower morbidity are estimated to be \napproximately  $79.15  per  child  (Table  A15.1).  The  analysis  assumes  the  following  (i) \nGovernment  expenditures  on  health  care  are  approximately  $10.50  per  person,  with  an \nestimated 30% increase for treating severe cases; (ii) out-of-pocket expenses are about $26.2 \n(iii) If children are severely ill, it is likely that 1-2 doctor\u2019s visits will occur before hospitalization. \nThe cost of a doctor\u2019s visit and transport from a rural area is about $12.50; and (iv) cost of \nmedication is $15.00.3 An estimated total net present value is $7,585,429 over 20 years   based \non saving 15,119 children and improving the health of 484,440 children benefited by the Project \nover a 20-year period.4 Given that the per capita income of the Kyrgyz Republic is only $300, \nthe health care cost of a sick child is a burden on households.  \n \nTable A15.1:  Cost of Health Care for Severe Illness/Death of Child ($) \n Government Expenditures                        13.15  \n Out-of Pocket Expenses                        26.00  \n Out-patient Visits                        25.00  \n Medication                        15.00  \n                      Total                        79.15  \n \n    b.  Benefits of Reduced Child Mortality \n \n12.  Improving infant and child mortality in the target raions is based on targets consistent \nwith the MDGs for the Kyrgyz Republic by 2015, which are to achieve a two-thirds decrease in \nIMR from 61.3 in 1997 to 20.8 in 2015, and a decrease in U5MR from 72.3 in 1997 to 24.6 in \n2015. The Project estimates a 30% reduction in U5MR from 2004 to 2009, followed by an \n                                                 \n2 Calculated from the hospital discharge survey. \n3 The Uzbekistan household survey showed that the average drug expenditure for respiratory and intestinal illness \nranged from $3.50 to $10.60 at the unofficial exchange rate and $14-43 at the official exchange rate.  The $15 \nmedication expense is based on an average. \n4 This figure represents the difference in the number of children in the target population in the with project scenario \nless the number of children in the without project scenario, or estimated children\u2019s lives saved by reducing under-5 \nchild mortality through project interventions. ", "54  Appendix 15 \nadditional 36% reduction between 2009 and 2015. The U5MR continues to decline after 2015, \nbut  at  a  slower  rate  beyond.  Immunization,  integrated  management  of  childhood  illness, \nimproved nutritional practices in homes, and  improved facilities, equipment and  training in \nhealth  centers  will  help  achieve  MDG  targets  provided  the  Government  sustains  these \ninterventions beyond the project period. The improvement in these health indicators is used to \ncalculate the income benefits of lives saved for the project target beneficiaries. The population \naged 0-4 years was selected as the base population for constructing cohort life tables that \nallowed age-specific mortality rates to be applied to the group of children benefiting from the \nProject. Life tables were constructed by partitioning time into intervals, and then counting for \neach time interval the number of subjects alive at the start of the interval, those who die during \nthe interval, and those who are lost to follow-up or withdrawn during the interval. The analysis \nassumes that those alive at the end of a time interval are at risk for the entire interval. \n \n13.  As a result of the Project, the 15,119 additional people in the 12 project raions will \neconomically contribute to society. The probability of finding employment affects how many \npeople in each age category are able to find work. It is assumed that children in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic begin to enter the workforce at age 15. This assumption is supported by statistics on \nthe  International  Labor  Organization  (ILO)  web  site.  The  age-specific  probability  of  work \nstatistics was taken from the ILO web site and is based on the projected probability of finding \nwork in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2010.5 The increased earnings accruing to society are calculated \nby multiplying the age- specific population by the probability of finding employment and the \nagricultural wage rate of $224. Table A15.2 shows the additional earnings that the 15,119 \npersons who are saved will contribute over their lifetimes. The wage rate represents 80% of the \ngross national income of $280/year. A 3% annual increase in wages is assumed throughout the \nlife of the population.  \n \nTable A15.2: Income Benefits to Society of Reduced Child Mortality ($) \n \n \nAgricultural Wage Rate  (per year)  Benefit (Net Present Value) \n224  4,323,380 \n230  4,439,122 \n \n14.  Note that the economic benefits accruing to society from reduced child mortality are \ntaken from just one project impact \u2013 a group of economically active children that would have \nperished without the Project.  \n \n    c.  Educational Benefits \n \n15.  Various  studies  conclude  that  increasing  educational  attainment  contributes  to  an \nincrease in wage levels. No relevant studies show the percentage increase in wages attributable \nto 1 year of additional education in the Kyrgyz Republic. The average length of schooling in the \nKyrgyz Republic is approximately 9 years. It is assumed that the Project will increase the \naverage years of education by 1 year. Using this information and studies from other countries, \nwe assume 1 one year of additional education contributes to a 2.6% increase in wage levels. \nApplying age-specific probability of work statistics and mortality rates to the 484,440 children \nbenefited by the Project, the increase in wages will lead to an additional lifetime earnings \ncontribution of about $5,971,759 by these children over 40 years.  \n                                                 \n5  ILO statistics are provided for the year 2000 and projected for 2010, based on current estimates.  Since the under 5 \npopulation will begin entering the workforce in 2010, the projections for 2010 were used to project lifetime earnings. ", "  Appendix 15  55 \n16.  Local educators acknowledge that enrollment and completion data in rural areas are \ninflated and that the official average 9 years of schooling is an overstatement for those areas. \nInternational research points to community mobilization, parent education, and preschool as \ninterventions  that  measurably  increase  school  enrollment  and  completion  rates.  Increased \nenrollment and completion in the early years of primary school results in higher benefits than a \ntenth  year  of  schooling.  Therefore  the  returns  in  Table  A15.3  likely  underestimate  the \neducational benefits of the Project in two ways: by the numbers of out-of-school children who \nwill enroll or complete additional years, and the value of the additional years completed. \n \nTable A15.3: Summary of Education Benefits ($) \n \nWage  Benefit (Net Present Value) \n224.00  224,765,737 \n228.48  230,737,496 \n \nE.

The \nbenefits of ECD investments accrue over the full lifetimes of beneficiaries and improved health \nand education of the next generation; these longer-term outcomes are not captured in the \nanalyses. Other benefits not fully captured or discussed here include improved efficiency in \nhealth and education systems; reinforcement of decentralization and local capacities; improved \nwomen\u2019s knowledge, skills, employment opportunities, and access to services (gender benefits); \nsavings due to reduced rates of child morbidity and malnutrition (which reduce the need for \ncurative  services)  and  improved  cognitive  development  and  school  performance;  expected \nreturns  on  schooling  in  terms  of  learning  about  new  technologies  and  markets  related  to \ninformation technology (a government priority); and improved quality of life for at least two \ngenerations.  Table  A15.4  shows  the  results  of  comparing  the  with-  and  -without  Project \nscenarios. Since research indicates that children that are healthier stay in school longer and are \nbetter prepared to learn, it is likely that in the future they will earn higher wages.  Therefore, it is \nassumed that the wage level without the Project is $224, and that with the Project is $230.  \n \nTable A15.4: Sensitivity Analysis \n \nCosts  Benefits  EIRR \n  ($)  ($)  (%) \nBase Case                  (15,284,820)              25,005,192      63.6 \nIncrease Costs 10%                   (16,813,302)              25,005,192     48.8 \nIncrease Costs 20%                   (18,341,784)              25,005,192     36.3 \nDecrease Benefits 10%                   (15,284,820)              22,504,673      47.2 \nDecrease Benefits 20%                   (15,284,820)              20,004,153      30.9 \nCosts Increase 10%  \nBenefits Decrease 10%                   (16,813,302)              22,004,153      33.9 \nCosts Increase 20%  \nBenefits Decrease 20%                   (18,341,784)              22,504,673        9.3 \n \n18.

The Project\u2019s recurrent costs that include maintenance of facilities, equipment, supplies \n(vaccines, essential drugs, and education materials), training, and monitoring will be a little over \n$1 million and represent less than 1% of the total health and education budget over the forecast \nperiod of 20 years (Table A15.5).

The Project encourages cost sharing by the ayil okmotu and the community. If their \ncontributions are considered, the percentage will further decrease. Major sources of recurrent \ncosts are vaccines and essential drugs. The Government has committed itself to be financially \nself-sustainable in procuring vaccines. Essential drugs will be increasingly made available as \nthe Mandatory Health Insurance Fund improves its function. Therefore, sustaining the activities \nplanned under the Project beyond the project period is expected to be within the fiscal capacity \nof the Government. Advance planning for procurement of vaccines and essential drugs has \nbeen included as a specific assurance to facilitate budget allocation upon project completion. \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n21.  The economic and social implications of not undertaking the ECD Project are serious \ngiven the recent trends in poverty, health, and education services in the Kyrgyz Republic. ECD \ninvestments are among the most effective means interrupting of the intergenerational transfer of \npoverty. The analysis shows a high EIRR of 63.6% can be expected from the Project. If \nimmunization and other benefits for children outside the 12 Project raions are factored in, the \nEIRR would be even higher. However, caution is needed in interpreting the EIRR. As the \neconomic returns of ECD interventions will largely materialize over a long term, estimation of \neconomic returns inevitably relies on a series of assumptions on costs and benefits of the \ninterventions, and external factors such as economic growth. Some economic benefits of ECD \nare hard to quantify, which leads to elimination or underestimation of certain benefits in the \nestimation.  Sensitivity  analyses  indicate  a  high  variability  of  the  EIRR  due  to  different \nassumptions.  The  EIRR  will  also  be  substantially  influenced  by  external  factors  affecting ", "  Appendix 15  57 \neconomic opportunities for the population, such as macroeconomic indicators. This means that \neven if the Project succeeds in achieving its intended objectives, the recurrent costs of the \nProject as the estimated financial sustainability analysis shows will be less than 1% of the total \nhealth and education budget. With advance planning, the Government should be able to absorb \nthe recurrent costs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "58  Appendix 16 \n               SUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY FORM \n  \nA.

Yes.  partnership agreement?  The poverty partnership \n  agreement (PPA) will be developed by the end of 2003. \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Krygyz Republic: \nThe quality of primary health care and early education, including diagnosis and treatment of chronic illnesses, disease \nand malnutrition, provides the basis for growth and development of children. Without adequate health services, the \nlifetime opportunities of children may be limited before the children enroll at school. Problems of children are \ncompounded in families living in poverty, especially in poor communities. Public investment in better health, nutrition, \nwater/sanitation, and  early  childhood development  offers long-term  human development benefits. Reduction  in \ndiseases due to iodine deficiencies offers immediate savings in public health expenditure. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: Core Poverty Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? In 2001,the poor comprised 40% of the population in urban areas, and 47% \nin rural areas, according to the Government national sample expenditure survey. The \"social passport\" data from the \nMinistry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) indicate higher poverty rate based on income data. Analysis of data \ncollected during project preparation reveals that larger families are concentrated in rural areas, and that the number of \nchildren aged 0-8 are greater in poor rural families. In addition to income poverty, analysis reveals higher rates of \niodine deficiency, anemia, and malnutrition in rural communities. Access to primary health care is reduced by lower \nlevel of services, lack of medicines and equipment, and the prohibitive cost of travel to the raion center for testing, \ndiagnosis, and treatment. Any preschool opportunities outside the raion center are the exception. Small/isolated rural \ncommunities lack both information about health, nutrition, and child development as well as the  resources to meet \nidentified needs. The Project targets the 12 poorest raions where poverty rate is above 69%, and most of the \ninterventions cover all eligible children. Therefore, more than 50% of the beneficiaries will be the poor. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis? National task forces and oblast task groups (raions vs oblasts) have identified services that no \nlonger meet standards achieved in former Soviet times. Solutions proposed tended to seek funding to meet the former \nSoviet Union\u2019s standards rather than reviewing needs and the most effective response to need. Participatory dialogue \nstakeholder opportunities and resources as well as problem analysis have been completed, and new solutions are \ndeveloping. \n \nParticipation strategy? The proposed project aims at community mobilization, including rapidly assessing needs, and \nidentifying potential responses, combined with a Village Initiative Fund giving communities some resources to \nprovide/improve children\u2019s services and an incentive to make those improvements. Project will also coordinate the  \ncommunity response to identified needs and improve the quality of basic health care, information about hygiene, \nnutrition, and child development, and thus, ensure a better preparation for children entering school. \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Krygyz Republic: Early Childhood Development (ECD) \ninterventions are key to interrupting intergenerational transfer of poverty by building opportunities for and capacities of \nindividuals born into poverty.  ECD interventions enable women to work and older girls to attend school. Project will be \nimplemented in the poorest raions, thus maximizing the effects of ECD interventions, which have the strongest \nimpacts, where participating children are from marginalized and low-income families. \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 16  59 \nD.         Gender and Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: No gender bias in primary health care or preschool education has been \nfound. The Project pays special attention to improved diagnosis of iodine and iron deficiencies in pregnant women. \nEarly childhood development has implications for women\u2019s life as well. Women\u2019s life is closely intertwined with their \nchildren\u2019s. ECD interventions will reduce women\u2019s time spent on caring for sick children. Increased access to \naffordable preschool programs will enable women to avail of economic opportunities. Reduction of iron deficiency \nanemia will improve women\u2019s productivity, and reduce pregnancy related risks including maternal mortality. \n \nE.
