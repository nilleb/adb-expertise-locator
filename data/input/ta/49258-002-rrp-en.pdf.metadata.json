THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed project \nreadiness financing (PRF) loan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Dhaka Mass Rapid \nTransit Development Project Readiness Financing (Line 5, Southern Route). \n \n2.   The proposed PRF will support the preparation and high project readiness of the ensuing \nloan. The Dhaka Mass Rapid Transit Line 5 (Southern Route) will be constructed between Gabtoli \nand Dasherkandi stations with a length of about 17.4 kilometers (km). The PRF will prepare the \ndetailed feasibility study, engineering design, and procurement document; and provide assistance \nin procurement-related processes. \n \nII.  PROJECT READINESS FINANCING \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The economy of Bangladesh has grown rapidly at an annual average rate of 6.5% since \n2005. With the transformation of the country\u2019s economic structure from agriculture oriented to \nmore value-adding manufacturing and service industries, the capital city of Dhaka plays a \nsignificant role as an industrial and commercial center. Dhaka contributes nearly 40% of the \nnational gross domestic product and attracts migrants from other regions who are looking for \nbetter business and employment opportunities. Dhaka\u2019s population was 15.9 million in 2011, and \nincreased at a rate of 3.9% from 2001 to 2011, well above the national growth rate of 1.4%.1 The \npopulation is projected to further increase to 26.3 million in 2035.2 \n \n4.  Traffic conditions and challenges in Dhaka. Despite its fast-growing population and \ncorresponding traffic demand, Dhaka lacks an alternative mass transit network and relies heavily \non road transport. Bangladesh Railway, the only railway system currently available in Dhaka, \nprovides  two  commuter  service  lines\u2014between  Dhaka  and  Narayagonj,  and  Dhaka  and \nJoydevpur\u2014which carry a total of about 25,000 passengers per day.3 Almost all of the 15 million \ndaily trips generated in the area are accommodated by road transport. An estimated 47% of \npassenger trips are made by buses and 14% by cars.4 The number of vehicles in Dhaka has been \nsteadily increasing. About 140,000 vehicles were newly registered in 2017, including about 20,000 \nprivate cars.5 Traffic volume in Dhaka already exceeds the road capacity by 20% on average \nduring peak hours, and by more than 100% on particular sections in the central areas, causing \nserious traffic congestion on major trunk roads.6 The average speed of travel by road is just 6.4 \nkm per hour during morning peak hours. The total economic loss caused by traffic congestion is \nestimated  at  about  7%  of  the  gross  domestic  product.7 Without  further  transport  sector \n \n1  The population referred to here is that of the area under the Rajdhani Unnnayan Kartripakkha (the Capital \nDevelopment Authority of Bangladesh), which includes Dhaka city and its peripheral areas of 1,429 square \nkilometers. \n2  Government of Bangladesh, Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority. 2016. Revised Strategic Transport Plan. \nDhaka. \n3  The current railway system remains a minor traffic modality in Dhaka because of the (i) limited number of lines and \nstations, (ii) low frequency and timeliness of the commuter train services, (iii) low quality of railway facilities, and (iv) \ninconvenience of ticketing and intermodal functions. \n4  Other major road traffic modes are rickshaw (32%), compressed natural gas (CNG) auto rickshaw/three wheelers \n(9%), and motorcycle (3%). \n5  Bangladesh Road Transport Authority. 2018. Number of Registered Motor Vehicles in Dhaka. Dhaka. \n6  The road pavement on major arterial roads in urban areas is in relatively good condition. However, traffic \nmanagement and traffic demand control, including signaling systems and intersection management, could be \nimproved, and currently contribute to the severe traffic congestion at several intersections. \n7  S. Chakraborty. 2016. Traffic Congestion in Dhaka City and its Economic Impact. Journal of Business Studies Special \nInternational Edition 2016. University of Dhaka. pp. 45\u201368. \n ", "2 \ninterventions in Dhaka, average peak hour travel speed is expected to further deteriorate to 4.5 \nkm per hour, with a traffic volume to road capacity ratio of 3.7 projected for 2035 (footnote 2). \n \n5.  Dhaka is the country\u2019s economic and commercial center, with high movement of people \nand goods. Higher incomes enable an increasing number of people to buy cars, while there is \nlimited potential to construct new or widen existing roads in the central areas of Dhaka without \nlarge-scale land acquisition and resettlement. Consequently, the government needs to provide \nefficient, high-quality public transport to reduce the traffic burden on the existing road network and \nshift traffic from private vehicles and low-capacity public buses.  \n \n6.  Government urban transport strategy. The transport sector strategic priority in the \ngovernment\u2019s Seventh Five-Year Plan is timely completion of critical transport links to improve \nconnectivity.8 A top priority in urban transport is to lower road network congestion through \nappropriate  investment  and  transport  management,  including  mass  rapid  transit  (MRT) \ndevelopment. In this context, the government formulated the Revised Strategic Transport Plan \n(RSTP) in 2016 as an urban transport master plan for Dhaka with a 20-year planning horizon \nthrough support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).9 The RSTP intends to \nensure mobility and access to vital urban services by providing a safe, equitable transport system \nthat uses efficient public transport modes. Special attention is given to the development of a \nsustainable public transport system that is integrated with land use and urban development.10 \n \n7.  The RSTP estimates that 1.0 million\u20132.6 million trips will be generated per day in 2035 \nbetween zones in central Dhaka.11 The generated traffic across the zones will concentrate on \nlimited trunk roads that mainly run north and south. Only new public transport modalities can be \nimplemented along those trunk roads. Given this constraint, the master plan identifies six distinct \npublic transport corridors with high passenger traffic demand that connect Dhaka\u2019s central \nbusiness  district  with  surrounding satellite regional  centers.  The  high  demand  along  these \ncorridors requires public transport capacity of 18,000\u201346,000 passengers per hour per direction \n(PPHPD), which will be effectively accommodated only by a high-capacity transit system.12 The \nRSTP  proposes five  MRT  lines  and two  bus rapid transit (BRT)  lines  along  the  identified \ncorridors.13 An efficient transit system will also help manage expanding urbanization through \ntransit-oriented development and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. These MRTs and BRTs \nare scheduled to be completed by 2035. The government has an action plan to advance the target \nof completion of three priority MRT lines (1, 5, and 6) to 2030 at the latest. \n \n8.  The first ever MRT network development in Bangladesh, including underground sections \nin congested areas, requires government intervention to ensure financial viability, allocate risks, \n \n8  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, General Economics Division. 2015. 7th Five-Year Plan, \nFY2016\u2013 FY2020: Accelerating Growth, Empowering Citizens. Dhaka. \n9  Government of Bangladesh, Dhaka Transport Coordination Board. 2005. Strategic Transport Plan for Dhaka. \nDhaka. The Strategic Transport Plan (STP) was prepared in 2005 in cooperation with the World Bank. The STP \nincludes the 20-year Urban Transportation Policy (2004\u20132024), which identifies priority issues such as improvement \nof mass transit systems (bus and rail transportation), development of urban expressways, and establishment of \ntransport institutions. \n10  The RSTP also proposed (i) a road network with three rings and eight radials to develop satellite regional centers \nand reduce through-traffic, and (ii) several short-term transport projects. \n11  The RSTP estimates the trips per day in 2035: 2.6 million between South Dhaka and West Dhaka, 1.1 million \nbetween West Dhaka and Gulshan, and 1.0 million between South Dhaka and Gulshan. Trips between central \nDhaka and surrounding areas of Gazipur will increase to 0.4 million\u20130.6 million. \n12  Among several public transport options, buses accommodate up to 3,000\u20134,000 PPHPD; light rail transit, 4,000\u2013\n15,000 PPHPD; automated guideway transit, 8,000\u201320,000 PPHPD; BRT 10,000\u201325,000 PPHPD; and MRT \n25,000\u201350,000 PPHPD. Given traffic volume and growth forecasts, the MRT and BRT are considered the best \noptions. \n13  The proposal comprises MRT Line 1 (52 km), MRT Line 2 (40 km), MRT Line 4 (16 km), MRT Line 5 (35 km), and \nMRT Line 6 (41 km); and BRT Line 3 (42 km) and BRT Line 7 (36 km). The STP proposed three MRTs and three \nBRTs. However, the RSTP reviewed the STP in terms of traffic demand and integration of urban development. \n ", "3 \nand develop implementation and operations standards.14 The Dhaka Mass Transit Company \nLimited (DMTCL) was established in 2013 as a state-owned company to construct, operate, and \nmaintain the MRT system in Dhaka and surrounding areas, and has begun preparing and \nimplementing the priority MRT lines. However, establishing a high-capacity and quality public \ntransport  system  requires  huge  financial  resources  and  operational  management  capacity. \nDevelopment partners have responded to government requests for assistance in preparing and \noperationalizing the system. In particular, JICA is supporting the construction of MRT Line 6 with \nhands-on technical cooperation and project preparation for MRT Line 1 and Line 5 (Northern \nRoute). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is providing assistance for the construction of BRT \nLine 3 (North), and a request has been received to finance MRT Line 5 (Southern Route).15 \nCurrently, the World Bank is assisting only BRT Line 3 (South). \n \n9.  The planned MRT Line 5, with its north and south sections, will have daily boarding \npassengers of 1,478,600 and PPHPD of 28,340 in 2035 (footnote 2). Though demand is less \ncompared to MRT Line 1 and Line 6 (which also runs north\u2013south), the government places a high \nvalue on Line 5 as an essential and priority MRT line to create an effective public transport network \nin Dhaka, serving one of the few east\u2013west corridors and providing intermodal stations with other \nMRT and BRT lines in the north\u2013south direction. The DMTCL\u2019s limited experience in implementing \na  complicated  mass  transit  system,  the  technical  and  traffic  management  challenges  of \nunderground construction in congested areas, and anticipated soft-ground conditions at a depot \nlocation require preparation of a complete, high-quality engineering design for Line 5 (Southern \nRoute) by leveraging international expertise with the assistance of ADB\u2019s PRF. \n \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. In line with the government\u2019s strategy, ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020  aims  to  ease  infrastructure  constraints  by  undertaking \ntransformational investments in key sectors, including transport.16 ADB places a high value on \nassistance for urban transport capacity expansion and efficiency improvements. In addition to the \nongoing BRT Line 3 (North) project, ADB has supported a prefeasibility study of the proposed \nMRT Line 5 (Southern Route) under project preparation technical assistance.17 The prefeasibility \nstudy examined the traffic demand forecast, operational plan, preliminary alignment, locations of \nthe stations and a depot, preliminary equipment specifications, preliminary safeguard surveys, \ncost estimates, and economic and financial analyses. The results confirmed the project\u2019s high \npriority and economic viability.18 The proposed PRF will ensure high project readiness of the \nlarge-scale ensuing MRT Line 5 (Southern Route) project and mobilize financing resources \nrequired for the project\u2019s engineering design. The proposed PRF is listed in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2020\u20132022 for Bangladesh.19 \n \n11.  The ensuing project will align with ADB\u2019s operational priorities under Strategy 2030 by \nproviding (i) sustainable and climate-resilient urban transport with low levels of greenhouse gas \nemissions; (ii) an integrated approach for sustainable urban development through transit-oriented \n \n14  The first MRT of Line 6 is all elevated. Line 1 and Line 5 will be the first MRT lines that include underground sections. \n15  ADB. 2012.

Private sector involvement. While DMTCL has the overall mandate for constructing, \noperating, and maintaining the MRT system, the PRF will also examine various options for private \nsector participation to leverage its efficiencies to yield better value for money. These include \ndiscrete unbundled elements such as automatic fare collection, maintenance contracts for rolling \nstock, and station maintenance. Non-farebox revenues from in-carriage and station advertising \nand commercial spaces will also be an area for private sector to yield value for the ensuing project. \n \nB.  Output and Activities \n \n13.  The PRF will ensure high readiness of the ensuing Dhaka Mass Rapid Transit Line 5 \n(Southern Route) project by delivering the following output.  \n \n14.  Output: Feasibility study, engineering design, and procurement support completed. \nThe PRF will support the preparation of a full-fledged feasibility study and engineering design for \ncivil works and equipment components of MRT Line 5 (Southern Route).22 It will also provide \nsupport for carrying out topographical, geological, and hydrological investigations; traffic surveys; \nsafeguard studies; economic and financial analyses; and other technical assessments needed for \npreparing the engineering design. Measures for climate and natural disaster resilience and \nfeatures for the elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities will be integrated into the \nengineering design. Technical compatibility with other metro lines, where relevant, will be secured \nin the design specifications. The design will also include advanced technology, such as an \nautomated  ticketing  and  fare  collection  system  with  an  integrated  database  for  operations \nmanagement. The PRF will help prepare procurement documents and activities in line with the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The PRF will also support the executing \nagency by engaging individual consultants to review the consultant\u2019s engineering design proposal \nbecause an underground metro is a relatively new concept for the agency and Bangladesh. \n \nC.  Ensuing Project \n \n15.  The PRF will support the preparation of a large-scale project for MRT Line 5 (Southern \nRoute). The ensuing project is anticipated to be financed through a multitranche financing facility, \nusing the time-slice financing approach. The base cost of the ensuing project is preliminarily \nestimated at $2.5 billion, and the indicative overall MFF amount will be determined over the course \nof project preparation, based on completed engineering design and identification of contingencies \nand potential cofinanciers. MRT Line 5 (Southern Route) will comprise a total length of about 17.4 \nkm between Gabtoli and Dasherkandi stations.23 The congested central area of Dhaka requires \n12.8 km of underground section with 12 stations, while the remaining section will be elevated with \nfour stations.24 The project will be connected to Line 5 (North) at Gabtoli station. A depot will be \n \n20 Transit-oriented design involves integrated urban and public transport development that maximizes residential and \ncommercial space within walking distance of public transport.

The basic design \nwill be prepared for the equipment components, including the rolling stocks, signaling communication system, power \nsupply system, and electrical and mechanical equipment. \n23 The scope of the ensuing project may be changed subject to the engineering design under the proposed PRF. \n24 Of the 12 underground stations, Gabtoli station will be constructed under MRT Line 5 (North). Two stations located \nat the east end of the elevated section will not be in service at the outset because of low traffic demand. \n ", "5 \nconstructed at the east end of the line near Dasherkandi station. The ensuing project will also \ninclude equipment components such as rolling stocks, signaling communication system, power \nsupply system, escalators and elevators, screen doors, and maintenance equipment.

The consultant recruitment \nstrategy shown in Table 3 considered maximizing value for money. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements for Project Readiness Financing \nAspects  Arrangements \nPRF implementation period  December 2019\u2013December 2023 \nEstimated PRF completion date  31 December 2023 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight bodies  Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges  \n(ii)  Executing agency  Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited \n(iii)  Implementing unit  Project implementation unit in Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited with 1 project \ndirector, 5 additional project directors, and project management and supporting \nstaff \nConsulting services  Engineering design consultants  566 person-months of international  $38.36 \n(QCBS 90:10) with full technical  services and 998 person-months of  million \nproposal  national services \nInternal audit (QCBS 80:20) with  National firm(s) of chartered  $0.14 \nsimplified technical proposal  accountants to provide the service  million \nIndividual consultants  6 person-months of international  $0.26 \nservices and 18 person-months of  million \nnational services \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting will be used for consulting services under the PRF. \nDisbursement  Disbursements under the PRF will follow ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between \nthe government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PRF = project readiness financing, QCBS = quality-and-cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  Consulting services under the PRF will use the prefeasibility study prepared under the \nproject preparatory technical assistance as the basis for the design work. The terms of reference \nprepared for the consulting services cover the necessary surveys and investigations, engineering \ndesign, poverty and social assessment, climate risk and vulnerability assessment, preparation of \nsafeguard documents, economic and financial analyses, and bid document preparation. Details \nof the terms of reference are described in the PAM. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n22.  The  executing  agency  is  the  Dhaka  Mass  Transit  Company  Limited,  which  was \nestablished in 2013 as a state-owned company under the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges ", "7 \nin accordance with Company Act 1994.26 The DMTCL\u2019s governance structure includes a board of \ndirectors,  with  most members  representing relevant  government ministries.  The  DMTCL  is \nmandated to establish, operate, and maintain the MRT system (including planning, survey, design, \ndevelopment, construction, and financing) in and around Dhaka city to meet the urban transport \nneeds of Dhaka and neighboring areas. \n \n23.  The proposed PRF will finance consulting services only and will not involve pilot-testing \nactivities; therefore, procurement risk is considered low. A financial management assessment \nwas conducted in May 2019. The financial management risk is considered moderate. The \nassessment showed that, despite some staffing and internal audit challenges, the executing \nagency has acceptable financial management arrangements in place including procedures for \nmaking payments, financial reporting, and auditing financial statements. Although this is DMTCL\u2019s \nfirst project with ADB, the agency has had experience in working with JICA and is familiar with \nsimilar procurement and financial management processes and standards. \n \nC.  Safeguards \n \n24.  Since the proposed activities consist of consulting services only, activities have not been \ncategorized per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).27 Safeguard classifications for the \nensuing project are expected to be category A for both environment and involuntary resettlement. \nNo adverse impacts from the ensuing project are expected for tribes, minor races, ethnic sects \nand communities.28 The PRF will finance preparation of the necessary safeguard documents \nbased on the surveys and engineering design. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n25.  The government and the DMTCL have assured ADB that PRF implementation shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n26.  I am satisfied that the proposed project readiness financing loan would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the loan of $33,260,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Dhaka Mass \nRapid Transit Development Project Readiness Financing (Line 5, Southern Route), from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 2.0% per \nyear during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n6 November 2019 \n \n26 Integrity due diligence conducted in May 2019 found no negative information on the DMTCL and its personnel. \n27 ADB. 2009.
