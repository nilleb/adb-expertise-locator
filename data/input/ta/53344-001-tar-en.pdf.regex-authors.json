INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Since 1969 the Asian Development Bank (ADB), through the Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department (ERCD), has been producing its annual flagship statistical \npublication\u2014Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific\u2014with the 2019 edition released in September \nbeing the 50th edition. Throughout these 50 years, the publication has compiled and presented \nofficial statistics for ADB regional members. The featured indicators have continued to evolve to \ntake  into  account  developments  over  time,  e.g.,  in  terms  of  development  goals,  from  the \nMillennium Development Goals that started in 2000 up to the current Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs). The coverage of statistics presented in Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific has \nalso expanded over time, from the very basic key indicators in its first edition in 1969 to a more \ncomprehensive set of statistics now. This has allowed it to maintain its relevance to data users, \nwhich include ADB Management and staff. Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific has been one \nof the most downloaded knowledge products of ADB.1 The proposed knowledge and support \ntechnical assistance (TA) will support the preparation of Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific \nthrough research and development in ADB, enabling the continuous provision of the latest \ncomprehensive  compendium  and  analysis  of  trends  in  economic,  social,  financial,  and \nenvironmental indicators (including the SDG indicators) of ADB\u2019s regional members. Aside from \nproviding  the  latest  comprehensive  compendium  and  analysis  of  trends  for  ADB  regional \nmembers, it is intended that Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific will provide a unique set of \nindicators on global value chains (GVCs) that capture trade links across countries and industries \nwhile accounting for the complex input\u2013output relationships involved in producing goods and \nservices.  Annual  special  supplements  that  provide  analysis  on  an  important  data-  and \nmethodology-related issue, including those resulting from ADB\u2019s statistical capacity building \n(SCB) initiatives, will also be prepared. In addition to the main publication, Key Indicators for Asia \nand the Pacific will continue to be accessible in a digital format through the new Key Indicators \nfor Asia and the Pacific database (KIDB),2 and will continue to evolve as a data product that \nprovides users easy access and interaction with data. \n \n2.  The knowledge and support TA cluster is included in the approved 2019 work plan of \nERCD and is an endorsed corporate priority TA project. The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030,3 which envisages ADB\u2019s role as a knowledge institution in Asia and the Pacific, expanding \nknowledge partnerships and knowledge dissemination.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Statistics are used by governments for designing policies and for making decisions \nconcerning the economy and society, as well as by private individuals for evaluating business \nprospects, e.g., by looking at some sets of statistics, or by researchers like think tanks and \nacademia in the analysis of the development issues impacting an economy and factors affecting \ndevelopment. The need to uphold the classic data quality standards of accuracy, reliability, and \ntimeliness is always a priority concern for producers and users of statistics. This implies that, for \n \n1  Download statistics of ADB\u2019s Department of Communications for January\u2013June 2019 show 13,234 downloads for \nKey Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2018 from the entire ADB catalogue. The total number of downloads is a proxy \nindicator that can provide a picture on how useful Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific data are to users. Ideally, \nthe total number of downloads is complemented by the count of downloads from developing member economies as \nwell as the count of KI data being cited or used in policy papers, research, and news articles. Coming up on more \ngranular download statistics will be coordinated with DOC.   \n2  https://kidb.adb.org/kidb/ \n3  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n4  The TA cluster first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 October 2019. \n ", "2 \npolicymakers  and  development  planners to  be  able  to make sound decisions,  high-quality \nstatistics\u2014i.e., accurate, reliable, and timely\u2014are desired. \n \n4.  Among the data standards, dissemination is also considered an important aspect because \ngood statistics, if not effectively disseminated, defeat the purpose for which they are generated \nand, therefore, are rendered not useful to the intended audience or users. Current expectations \nare that accurate, reliable, and timely statistics are made available and are accessible in different \nmedia, going beyond the printed form. Experience with past Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific \neditions indicate the need to strengthen collaboration with the Department of Communications \n(DOC) on disseminating Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific through DOC channels. \n \n5.  While Asia and the Pacific has attained significant economic growth, the recognition that \ngrowth could be more inclusive persists, which is consistent with the aim of the SDGs of leaving \nno one behind. High-quality data with greater granularization are desirable for the design of \npolicies that promote the welfare of the disadvantaged sectors of society. Evidence-based policies \nrely on access to high-quality statistics for informing inter- and intra-country analyses on a wide \nvariety of topics, including the SDGs and GVCs. The statistical capacity of ADB developing \nmember countries (DMCs) also needs to be strengthened and updated for the production of high-\nquality statistics, a continuous process that will help create awareness among members as \nproducers of data as well as among users of data. In this sense, the cluster TA will build on the \nachievements and lessons learned from the Key Indicators 2018-2020 cluster TA5 and previous \nKey Indicators TAs, where standards followed in compiling critical macroeconomic data (e.g., \nnational accounts, balance of payments, government finance statistics) for policymaking were \nrevisited and revised toward adopting latest international standards. By doing this and subject to \ncapacity of DMCs, the TA will enable a harmonized data set for the DMCs that meet international \nstandards, thereby fostering regional cooperation and integration. ADB has also implemented \nvarious SCB TA grants that have resulted in improvements in DMCs\u2019 statistical capacity, e.g., TAs \nthat aimed to develop the capacity of national statistical systems that benefited countries such as \nBhutan, Cambodia, and Myanmar; TAs that explored ways of improving data collection; and \nprojects that improved the quality of statistics collected. \n  \n6.  Moreover, as an international organization, ADB needs to have a strong information \nbase\u2014a  one-stop  database  that  is  of  high  quality  and  attuned  to  the  latest  international \ncompilation standards\u2014on its members\u2019 socioeconomic, financial, and environmental status for \ntracking progress in Asia and the Pacific and to support its operations in implementing Strategy \n2030. \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n7.  As Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific involves recurring data and research work that \nare often closely linked across editions, the TA cluster modality will be used. The TA also needs \na multiyear implementation period with broadly defined scope, allowing advanced preparation and \nflexibility for refining each subproject as needed. \n \n \n5 ADB. Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2018-2020. https://www.adb.org/projects/50160-007/main.  \n ", "3 \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n8.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impacts: evidence-based policy-making, \ninvestment decisions, and project design influenced in ADB DMCs.6 The TA cluster will have the \nfollowing outcome: use of Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific data and analysis for evidence-\nbased policy-making by DMC officials and economic researchers sustained.7 \n \n9.  Output 1: Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific and other statistical publications \nprepared and published. The TA will support the production of the 2021, 2022, and 2023 editions \nof Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific that will entail annual data collection activities from \nnational, international, and ADB sources to compile updated statistical tables and the KIDB on \nregional member countries. With the emergence of new development issues and the changing \nneeds of Asia and the Pacific, data provided by Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific on ADB \nregional members become crucial to evidence-based policymaking. As such, the publication is \nintended to serve as a resource for information related to the development issues confronting \nADB  regional  members.  It  presents  a  comprehensive  set  of  economic,  financial,  social, \nenvironmental, and selected statistical indicators of the SDGs through its country tables, regional \ntables  in  eight  broad  themes  (people;  economy  and  output;  money,  finance,  and  prices; \nglobalization; transport and communication; energy and electricity; environment; and government \nand governance), and the SDG tables by goal. It also covers the GVC statistics that have been \nincluded in Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific since the 2015 edition. GVC statistics show \nhow the economies in Asia and the Pacific continue to strengthen, broaden, and diversify their \nparticipation in global production networks. Other innovative work will include improvements in \nstatistical databases and data collection from ADB\u2019s DMCs, such as the use of the Structured \nData and Metadata eXchange.8 The Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific publication and the \ndata in it will be disseminated digitally in coordination with the DOC via the ADB website and the \nnew KIDB (footnote 2). Its impact will be monitored through new parameters, aside from the usual \ndownload metrics, that consider the new ways of disseminating information, e.g., through social \nmedia platforms. As it is also intended as a reference for ADB Management and operations, \ndissemination of Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific will also cater to internal clients to create \nawareness on available statistical information on ADB DMCs by holding knowledge-sharing \nevents. Moreover, while digital publication will be the main form of dissemination, a limited number \nof printed copies (around 400) will be produced for promotional or awareness-raising purposes \nand to meet requests of some specific groups for Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific data. \n \n10.  The TA will also support the production of another data product with high demand among \ndata users\u2014the annual Basic Statistics brochure\u2014specifically the 2021, 2022, and 2023 editions. \nLike Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific, Basic Statistics has been a long-existing data product \nof ADB, having first been published in 1998. Basic Statistics presents current data for ADB DMCs \non core and selected economic, environmental, and social indicators used globally to track \nprogress toward the SDGs. It is intended to serve as a handy and comprehensive source of \nsnapshot information on ADB\u2019s DMCs. As in the past editions, Basic Statistics for 2021, 2022, \nand 2023 will be available digitally on the ADB website and will also be accessible using mobile \ntechnology.  A  limited  number  of  printed  copies  will  be  produced  for  internal  use  of  ADB \n \n6  Defined by the TA. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n8  Structured Data and Metadata eXchange refers to an international standard of data and metadata exchange. Data \nreported according to this standard allows multipurpose sharing for national data exchange as well as sharing with \ninternational organizations. \n ", "4 \nManagement and staff and for consumption of the general public. Basic Statistics is also used by \nADB for awareness-raising events, which help promote the profile of ADB as a knowledge center \nin Asia and the Pacific. \n \n11.  Output 2: Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific special supplements prepared and \npublished. The TA will support the preparation of the Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific \nspecial supplements for 2021, 2022, and 2023. Candidate topics for the special supplement will \ngenerally draw from the experiences and results of ADB SCB projects, or topics on statistical \nmeasurement, methodology, and applications of statistical standards. It has been noted that, \nthrough the data collection activities of Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific from official \nstatistical partners in the ADB DMCs, the statistical capacity of DMCs can be indirectly gauged. \nData collected provide information on the concepts used for the compilation, the degree of \ncompliance with international standards, data collection practices, data limitations, dissemination \navenues, and areas for improvement. For national accounts, for example, some DMCs are still \nnot completely adherent to the recommendations of the 2008 System of National Accounts9 and \nneed technical support to improve the compilation of their national accounts. Enhancing the \ncapacity of national statistical offices in compiling national accounts is one of the outputs identified \nin ongoing SCB projects, along with ways of using innovative data sources, e.g., satellite images, \nmobile data, or social media data to produce disaggregated data for official statistics, or on \ndeveloping  a  suite  of  innovative  socioeconomic  data  compilation  and  analysis  frameworks \ncomprising extended supply and use tables, extended input\u2013output tables, and social accounting \nmatrixes. All these examples provide information on what areas SCB projects can focus on in \nfuture and can be candidate topics for the special supplement. \n \n12.  Output 3: Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific database updated regularly and \nADB Statistics Portal and AsiaData application upgraded. With the release of the new user-\nfriendly KIDB in September 2019, accessing information on ADB\u2019s regional members is more \nconvenient and interactive. The database\u2019s advanced functionality allows users to experience \nimproved data searching, flexibility in downloading data, and customized data visualization. The \nchallenge is sustaining the continuous modernization and innovation of the database for it to \ncontinue to be a reliable one-stop source of information on ADB\u2019s regional members. The TA will \nsupport the continuous improvement of the database to keep up with the demands of users and \nwith changes in technology. \n \n13.  The TA will support the maintenance and regular updating of the Portal for Statistics \nResources, or the Statistics Portal.10 The portal offers a systematic structure for organizing and \ndisseminating the in-house statistics resources in ADB, e.g., databases and survey data sets. It \nprovides data support and information regarding data availability and resources that are useful \nfor research activities of ADB or for formulating policy recommendations. It provides information \non how to access or procure statistics resources that are not available within ADB or that cannot \nbe obtained through the internet. The portal is available internally within ADB. \n \n14.  Upgrading the AsiaData application\u2014a visualization tool for mobile devices that presents \nthe  latest  macroeconomic  and  social  indicators  for  ADB's  regional  members\u2014will  also  be \nsupported by the TA. The application allows users free access to the data and allows them to \neasily construct their own graphs and tables using any of the over 200 featured indicators for ADB \nregional members. Users can readily compare countries for one indicator or compare trends of \none indicator for a country. Similar to ready-made graphs, user-defined graphs can be saved or \n \n9  The United Nations. 2010. System of National Accounts 2008.

The application is available for Android \nand Apple operating systems. Upgrading the application will require information technology (IT) \nexpertise. \n \n15.  Output 4: Workshops for knowledge sharing and dissemination conducted. Among \nthe data standards, dissemination is also considered an important aspect. Current expectations \nare that accurate, reliable, and timely statistics are made available and are accessible in different \nmedia, going beyond the printed form. Under the TA, the Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific \npublication and data will be disseminated via web launch and/or launch events.11 It will include \nkey results and data stories about Asia and the Pacific that are based on the data included in Key \nIndicators for Asia and the Pacific. Knowledge-sharing sessions within ADB will also be conducted \nfor the special supplement and the GVCs, on Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific as a data \nproduct to increase awareness about the publication and the KIDB, on the Statistics Portal, and \non AsiaData. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $2,400,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6 and TASF Others). Detailed cost estimates \nand financing arrangements will be presented in each TA subproject proposal submitted for \napproval. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA cluster through the Statistics and Data Innovation Unit of the \nOffice of the Chief Economist and Director General (EROD-SDI) (Table 1). EROD-SDI will \ncoordinate with other ADB units (regional and other departments, resident missions, and sector \nand thematic groups) and statistical partners in ADB regional members in undertaking the TA \nactivities.  The  cluster  TA  will  be  implemented  over  52  months\u2014from  September  2020  to \nDecember  2024.  Each  TA  subproject  proposal  will  be  submitted  for  approval  to  the  chief \neconomist and director general of ERCD, in accordance with the business process for knowledge \nand support TA cluster processing. Subproject activities will start only after approval. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  September 2020\u2013December 2024 \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  ADB (ERCD/EROD-SDI) \nConsultantsa  Package title  Selection method  Engaged by \nConsulting firm:  Quality- and cost- ADB.
