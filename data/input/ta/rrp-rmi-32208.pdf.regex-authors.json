An initial environmental examination was undertaken. \nAssessment  Its summary is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will reduce poverty by improving the safety, reliability, \nand efficiency of transport services to the outer atolls and islands \nthrough construction of navigation aids, small wharves and jetties, \nairstrip  extensions,  warehouses,  and  track  improvements. \nComplementary nonlending assistance will strengthen institutional \ncapacity to manage shipping and air services to the outer islands.  \n   \nRationale  Thirty percent of the population live in the 18 outer islands in the \nproject area. Communities in the outer islands suffer from physical \nisolation  leading  to  low  incomes,  lack  of  basic  services,  and \npoverty of opportunity. The people who live in these outer islands \nhave significantly lower incomes than the national average, and it \nis estimated that almost two thirds of the population in the project \narea have an income level below the United Nations Development \nProgramme poverty line threshold of $1 a day. \n \nTransport  services  provide  the  lifeline  to  these  outer  islands. \nShipping brings in essential goods and services, and takes out \nisland produce from which the people earn a substantial portion of \ntheir incomes. Shipping also brings in government services and \nsupplies,  particularly  to  schools  and  health  clinics.  Shipping \nprovides an essential service to families in transporting children to \nand  from  secondary  schools  and  colleges  elsewhere  in  the \nRepublic  of  the  Marshall  Islands,  and  in  providing  links  for \neveryone to the urban centers and the outside world. Air services \nprovide passenger and freight transport, as well as emergency \nevacuation services for sick and vulnerable people. \n \nTransport  operations  are  at  present  complicated  by  poor \ninfrastructure and facilities in the outer islands. In particular, the \nsea approaches and landings on coral atolls are often constrained \nby narrow reef passages, navigation obstructions, and shallow \nreef  flats,  making  landing  difficult.  Weather,  sea,  and  light \nconditions restrict the time available for anchoring and lightering \ngoods and passengers ashore; passengers are subject to greater \nrisk  and  discomfort;  and  there  is  frequent  damage  to  cargo. \nNavigation aids are almost entirely absent and there are few ship \ndocks  or small  boat jetties.  Where  beach landings are required, ", " \nii \n  channels need to be cleared to allow small boats to reach the \nshore. On land, warehousing for storing goods and local produce \nfor export is required at a central location to improve the efficiency \nof shipping operations. Most atolls have airstrips, but they are \nunsealed and often poorly maintained. In some cases, restricted \nrunway length reduces aircraft capacity and range. \n \nTogether,  these  constraints  lead  to  infrequent  and  unreliable \nschedules, increased safety risks to passengers and cargo, and \nadded costs to outer island transport. These, in turn, limit the \nopportunity for social interaction; access to education, health, and \nbusiness development services; and the ability of public agencies \nto deliver programs and develop social infrastructure in the outer \nislands.  It  also  increases  the  prices  of  essential  goods  and \ndiscourages production and marketing of local produce, such as \ncopra, fruits and vegetables, fish, and handicrafts. \n   \nObjective and Scope  The objective of the Project is to reduce poverty through safer, \nmore frequent, and reliable shipping and transport services in the \nouter  islands  that  will  (i)  improve  access  to  basic  goods  and \nservices, and (ii) assist in increasing incomes from the sale of \nproduce and handicrafts from the outer islands in the main centers \nof Majuro and Ebeye. \n \nThe scope of the Project includes the construction, installation, \nand/or improvement/renovation of: \n \n(i)  outer island port infrastructure, comprising docks, jetties, and \nbeach channels; \n(ii)  navigation  aids,  comprising  lit  beacons,  buoys,  and  land \nlights; \n(iii)  improvements to tracks for goods movement; \n(iv)  storage warehouses for concentration of cargo; and \n(v)  airstrip extensions and remedial maintenance. \n   \nCost Estimates  The Project is estimated to cost $10.0 million equivalent, of which \n$6.84 million equivalent (68.4%) is the foreign exchange cost and \n$3.16 million equivalent (31.6%) is the local currency cost. \n   \n \nFinancing Plan  Foreign  Local \nCurrency  Currency  Total Cost  Financing \nSource  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  (%) \n  ADB  6.84  0.16  7.00  70.0 \nGovernment  0.00  3.00  3.00  30.0 \nTotal  6.84  3.16       10.00       100.0 \n   \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \n   ", " \niii\nLoan Amount and Terms  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of Special \nDrawing  Rights  5.304  million  (equivalent  to  $7.0 million)  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will be repayable in 32 \nyears with a grace period of 8 years and interest charges of 1% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2007 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2006 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A project coordination committee will be established to monitor \nArrangements  project  implementation.  Consulting  services  will  support \npreconstruction and implementation activities. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) \n   \nProcurement  Due to limited competition within the local construction industry, \nmarine civil works and other procurement will be tendered using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Qualified  local  construction \ncompanies will be permitted to tender for the work in their own \nright or in association with an international partner, either for the \nmain contract or as nominated subcontractors. \n   \nConsulting Services  International consulting services will be required for: \n \n(i)  management of preconstruction site investigation, \n(ii)  environmental investigation and reporting to the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands and ADB, \n(iii)  engineering design and construction supervision, and \n(iv)  strengthening  of  MOTC  capacity  for  management  of  the \nshipping  service  franchise  scheme  and  the  government \nshipping service. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  benefits  accrue  to  three  main  parties:  (i) outer  island \nBeneficiaries  residents, who will be able to: (a) access basic services (e.g., \nbasic health and education) and commodities (e.g., staple food, \nfuels, and other household goods) on a more regular and reliable \nbasis and with more choice and greater competition; (b) more \neasily and regularly ship handicrafts, fish, and agricultural produce \nto  main  centers;  (c)  increase  family  incomes,  enabling  easier \npayment of school fees and increasing levels of consumption of \ngoods from island stores; (d) have additional income to invest in \nbetter  housing,  household  assets,  water  tanks,  and  domestic \nsanitation  facilities;  (e)  reduce  their  travel  times,  making  the \nshipping  service  more  attractive  and  thereby  increasing \npatronage;  (ii) the  whole  population  of  the  Republic  of  the \nMarshall  Islands,  who  will  benefit  from  the  reduced  budgetary \ncosts  of  providing  public  services  to  the  outer  islands  and  in ", " \niv \nrunning the shipping service as a result of reduced voyage times, \nincreased safety, and less damage to ships and cargo during \nloading/unloading; these savings will enable more resources to be \nallocated to priority sectors, including health and education, and to \nother poverty reduction activities; and (iii) private sector shipping \nand island traders, who will benefit from a safer, more regular, and \nmore  reliable  shipping  service;  competitive  pressures  between \ngovernment shipping and private operators will help lower or at \nleast maintain freight costs; and increased reliability and shorter \ntrip times will allow lower stock levels to be maintained and will \nincrease overall profitability of enterprises. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Nonlending technical assistance (TA) in the amount of $250,000 \nwill be attached to the loan. The quality and cost-based selection \nmethod  and  simplified  technical  proposals  will  be  used  in  the \nconsultant selection. The TA will provide assistance to MOTC and \nAir Marshall Islands for (i) performance monitoring of the private \nsector  shipping  services  vis-\u00e0-vis  their  contracts  and  of  the \ngovernment shipping service, (ii) improvement of business and \ninformation systems for the government shipping and air services, \nand (iii) long-term fleet planning. \n ", " \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) for the Outer Island Transport Infrastructure \nProject. The Project provides for the construction of island docks, jetties, beach channels, \nnavigation aids, runway extensions and onshore supporting infrastructure on 18 outer islands, \nnationwide. The project framework is in Appendix 1. The report also describes complementary \nnonlending technical assistance (TA) for improving the delivery of sea and air transport services \nto help ensure that the full economic benefits of the Project are realized; and if the proposed \nloan is approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Overview \n2.  The RMI comprises 29 coral atolls and five true islands scattered over 1.9 million square \nkilometers (km2) of the central Pacific Ocean. The atolls are distributed over 900 km from north \nto south and 1,200 km from east to west in two roughly parallel chains running northwest to \nsoutheast\u2014the eastern Ralik Chain and the western Ratak Chain. The total land area of about \n180  km2  constitutes  only  0.01%  of  the  total  geographic  area  within  the  RMI\u2019s  exclusive \neconomic  zone.  The  population  of  the  RMI  from  the  1999  population  census  was  50,840 \nconcentrated in the two main atolls of Majuro (23,676) and Kwajalein (Ebeye) (10,902). The \nouter  islands  support  populations  of  between  95  and  2,000  spread  over  numerous  islets, \ntypically with population concentrations of up to 200 per km2. In some cases, individual islets are \nconnected by dry reef at low tide and in a few cases have been connected by engineered \ncauseways. \n \n3.  The outer island population subsists on a diet of fish, coconut, breadfruit, pandanus, and \nother produce, supplemented with imported rice, flour, and sugar. The main cash crop is copra. \nOther outer island production includes handicrafts, small quantities of fruits and vegetables, and \nfish for sale in Majuro and Ebeye. Vessels also carry passengers and general cargo to and from \nthe outer islands.  \n \n4.  The Ministry of Resources and Development is presently investigating opportunities for: \ndiversification of crops and other economic activities, including fruit and vegetable production to \nenhance atoll diets and to sell in the urban centers of Majuro and Ebeye; increasing fish catches \nfor sale in the urban markets; aquaculture, especially seaweed and pearls; noni fruit production; \nand ecotourism.  It is also investigating the possibility of improving local value added from copra \nthrough the production of additional by-products (charcoal, brooms, and coir) for the local \nmarket, and through trialing of cold-pressed virgin oil for cooking and cosmetic use. Other \nresearch includes intercropping coconuts with corn for animal feed. \n \n2.  Poverty \n5.  The islands of the project area have household incomes well below the national average \nand reflect the largely subsistence nature of livelihood in the outer islands. Forty percent of \nhouseholds in the project area has incomes of less than $1,000 per annum, and 70% had ", "2 \nincomes of less than $3,000. These figures compare with the national averages of 13.6% and \n27.5%, respectively. In six of the 18 project islands, the proportion of households with incomes \nless than $3,000 exceeds 75%. In one island, Lib, it reaches 100%. Only in Jaluit, Utirik, and \nWotje do more than 50% of the households have incomes greater than $3,000. \n \n6.  The median per capita annual income shows that half of the outer island population was \nactually earning only $0.62/day. Both measures of per capita income indicate that almost two \nthirds  of  the  population  of  the  project  area  had  incomes  well  below  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) standard threshold of $1 per day, the level that is considered \nnecessary to purchase an individual\u2019s minimum daily nutritional requirements. Within the project \narea, the islands with the lowest per capita incomes were Lib and Ailuk, at $0.22 and $0.59 per \ncapita per day, respectively. Those with the highest incomes were Jaluit ($1.96 per capita per \nday), Likiep ($1.81), Maloelap ($1.54), and Utirik ($1.53). On average, there was no significant \ndifference in the per capita incomes between the closer and the more distant islands. \n \n7.  In health indicators, fewer than 1% of the households in the project area have piped \nwater, compared to a quarter of those in the other parts of the country. In the project area, wells \nor  rain  catchments  are  the  principal  sources  of  water;  these  are  both  susceptible  to \ncontamination. In respect of sanitation facilities, 58% of households in the project area either \nhave no toilet facilities or use pit latrines. This compares to only 18% in the rest of the country. \nThe poor sanitation and lack of safe water is a primary cause of the high level of diarrheal \ndiseases reported in the outer islands. Diabetes, measles, hypertension, and most recently \ntuberculosis, are among the other more prevalent diseases reported in the project area. \n \n3.  Interisland Transport \n8.  The islands of the project area are also isolated by distance and by infrequent and \nunreliable sea transport. While air transport is available, it is at high cost and of limited capacity, \nparticularly for air cargo. This isolation discourages cash production and engagement in the \nwider national economy. It is difficult to maintain social contacts with other islands, and the \ndelivery of government social and economic development services is costly and constrained.  \n \n9.  Historically, shipping services have been provided directly by the Government through \nthe Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) at heavily subsidized freight rates \nand passenger fares, in recognition of the fact that for many of the outer islands a shipping \nservice is not commercially viable. The Government accepts some subsidy as unavoidable if it \nis to meet its social and economic objectives of reducing poverty, countering population drift to \nthe main centers, and expanding development opportunities for the outer island population.  \n \n10.  In 1999, with ADB assistance, in an effort to reduce the public subsidy requirement and \nto provide opportunities for the private sector to compete in the market, MOTC invited tenders \nfrom the private sector to operate shipping services (Appendix 2). A contract was awarded to a \nprivate operator and currently MOTC and the private franchisee both operate on the same route \non a rotational basis. This competition provides both a check on the private operator and a basis \nfor comparison of the efficiencies of government and private operations. \n \n11.  However, the service could be substantially improved at a number of locations that are \ndifficult to service because of tidal restrictions. Often, up to six hours\u2014or half of the tidal cycle\u2014\nare lost because the water depths are too shallow for small boats to carry cargo or passengers \nbetween ship and shore. Another factor is weather, and locations facing the easterly quarter and \nthat are unprotected by land can be difficult to access because of wave action. In many ", "3 \ninstances,  creation  or  deepening  of  beach  channels,  navigation  aids1  and  marks,  new  or \nextended boat jetties, and ship docks would significantly improve ship turnaround times.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Problems and Constraints \n12.   An analysis of problems and constraints is given in Appendix 3. There are physical \nconstraints of sea approaches and berthing at outer island points of call, coupled with the \ndifficulties of sustaining a reliable shipping service where distances are long and transport \nvolumes are low.  The institutional capacity for administering shipping service franchises and for \noperating government-owned vessels is limited, and the need to subsidize the shipping service \nhas been a long-term drain on the government budget. \n13.  The physical constraints of navigation and landing in the outer islands can be eased by \nselective provision of marine transport infrastructure, which is the main focus of the Project.  Of \nprime importance is the provision of navigation aids, which will allow ships to safely enter \nlagoons  and  approach  the  landing  places  under  poor  daylight  conditions  and  at  night.  \nImprovements  to  landings  through  ship  docks,  boat  jetties,  and  beach  channels  will  allow \nworking over a wider range of the tide cycle, ease the manual work involved, allow safer transfer \nof passengers between ship and shore, and reduce cargo spoilage. Outer island airstrips are \ngenerally poorly maintained and, in some cases, short runway length limits take-off weight and \naircraft carrying capacity. Runway extensions and surface improvements will both increase \ntransport  capacity  and  reduce  aircraft  damage,  lowering  costs.  In  case  of  emergency,  air \ntransport is the only practical option and for this reason, adequate, well-maintained airstrips are \na strategic and lifeline necessity. \n14.  In several locations, transferring passengers and goods between ship and shore can be \ninconvenient, time consuming, and even hazardous. While sheltered anchorages exist in some \nlocations so that small boat lighterage is straightforward, in other places onshore prevailing \nwinds and long fetches either across the ocean or wide lagoons, combined with wide and \nshallow reef shelves, make discharge and embarkation difficult. It is in these locations that the \nbenefits of an improved landing will be the greatest. \n15.  Experience in the past has been that government-provided shipping has imposed a high \ncost  on  the  MOTC  budget,  for  several  reasons:  (i) higher  wage  rates  for  public  sector \nemployees  and  little  incentive  for  improved  labor  productivity;  (ii) ships  of  a  size  and \nconfiguration that are not well suited to the service and that are expensive to run; (iii) diversion \nof ships from their service schedule by government direction; and (iv) difficulty in mobilizing \ncash for payment of operating expenses and for periodic maintenance. \n16.  Experience  with  the  shipping  franchise  scheme  demonstrates  that  a  competitive \ntendering system to minimize subsidy payments and to remove shipping operations from direct \ngovernment operation is feasible, but requires some modification. It is important that other \ngovernment agencies do not operate subsidized shipping services in the franchise area, if the \nscheme is to succeed. However, there should be freedom for unsubsidized private or local \ngovernment operators to provide services, as is currently done for atolls close to Majuro. \n                                                 \n1   Apart from some existing navigation marks for the main reef passages into Majuro and Kwajalein atolls, there are \nvery few navigation aids for inter- and intra-atoll shipping. A lack of navigation aids limits navigation in many \nplaces to daylight hours and favorable tide and weather conditions. ", "4 \n17.  Air Marshall Islands (AMI) is a small airline, operating only two Dornier 228 aircraft, \nwhich are used primarily on outer island services, and one flight a week from Majuro to Tarawa \nin Kiribati. Historically, AMI has operated international services to Fiji and to Honolulu and has \nhad longer-range passenger and freight capacity. Freight and longer-range passenger capacity \nto the furthest islands of Bikini and Enewetak is limited, and the airline has been endeavoring to \nlease a Dash-8 to supplement its service. The airline is short of capital, and the two Dornier \naircraft  are  aging  and  experience  considerable  downtime,  and  will  eventually  require \nreplacement. The sector analysis is in Appendix 4. \n \n2.  Opportunities \n18.  These  infrastructure  deficiencies  add  considerable  time  to  voyages  of  the  field  trip \nvessels  as  well  as  exposing  vessels  and  cargo  to  damage  and  passengers  to  risk  and \ndiscomfort. Poverty reduction will be fostered by improvements to the regularity and reliability of \nship  visits  to  each  island.  This  will  have  the  following  poverty  reduction  benefits  and \nopportunities for the communities: \n(i)  improved availability of services from government agencies, including health and \neducation, will help reduce problems of access to basic services, information, \nsupplies of schoolbooks, and materials and supplies for island clinics, and will \nassist in the implementation of other outer island projects through better transport \nof labor, materials, and equipment; \n(ii)  improved supply and availability of goods from the on-board merchants at more \ncompetitive prices with fewer opportunities for island stores to overcharge for \ngoods between irregular ship calls will assist poor families to get better value for \ntheir low incomes; \n(iii)  improved shipping for export of produce from the islands to the markets in Majuro \nand Ebeye will enable outer island families to increase their incomes and will \nhelp create more employment opportunities; \n(iv)  improved commercial systems for shipping\u2014including recording of cargoes and \ngoods liability regimes and less loss or damage to perishable and other cargoes \nfrom poor handling facilities at island wharves\u2014will help address problems with \nsecurity of cargoes and late payment and will thus assist the poor to maximize \nthe  returns  from  their  production;  they  will  also  assist  in  creating  a  better \nenvironment in which private enterprises can be established; \n(v)  improved  safety  on  board  ships  from  better  navigation  aids  and  passenger \nfacilities  at  the  embarkation/disembarkation  points  at  the  island  wharves, \nespecially for children and the elderly (fatal accidents have occurred at some \ndifficult locations in the past); and \n(vi)  runway  extensions  and  improved  runway  maintenance  will  provide \ndisadvantaged outer island families with (a) safer, more regular, and reliable \nflights to the main centers; (b) allow higher payloads and increased space for \nhigh-value  and  perishable  goods;  and  (c)  provide  improved  emergency \nevacuation services as required. ", "5 \n19.  Specifically, in relation to increasing outer island incomes, the following key benefits will \naccrue: \n(i)  more frequent and regular shipping will enable farmers to (i) achieve a more \nstable income flow from more regular sales; and (ii) stockpile their own product \nand to sell direct to the agent on the ship rather than to the island buyer, thereby \nreceiving a better \u201cfarmgate\u201d price. In the past, irregular shipping has given the \nisland buyer and the island store operators opportunities for paying lower prices \nto the farmers when cash has been short and credit has been needed; this has \npenalized the poorest parts of the community who have had no access to other \nincome sources; \n(ii)  a better farmgate price will increase producer income which, together with better \ncash flows, will reduce the pressure for higher prices; \n(iii)  a regular supply of fresh, better quality copra to the oil mill will enable the copra \nprocessing and marketing company, Tobolar, to: (a) obtain a higher oil yield per \nton of copra; (b) produce a higher quality oil, thereby achieving a price bonus for \nbetter color and lower free-fatty-acids in the product; and (c) achieve a lower unit \nprocessing cost per ton of throughput (the mill is presently operating at less than \n50% of design capacity); and \n(iv)  a higher tonnage of product will generate higher freight for the ship operators \nboth directly and indirectly as the outer island people will have higher incomes \nand will therefore purchase more goods from the on-board merchants who, in \nturn, will pay more freight. \n20.  The accompanying TA will assist MOTC and AMI in the development and streamlining of \noperational and management information systems and processes. This will include strategic \nplanning of shipping and aircraft fleet maintenance, retirements, redeployment, and acquisitions. \n \n3.  Strategy \n21.  The ADB country strategy is focused on its overarching goal of poverty reduction. This is \nbeing pursued through the following three-pronged strategy of ADB assistance to the RMI. The \nfirst prong is to support poverty reduction and the creation of new economic opportunities and \nimprove access to basic social services in the outer islands. The second is to enhance the \nenvironment for private sector investment, job creation, and growth.2 The third is to continue to \nstrengthen  public  sector  governance  and  to  enhance  public  sector  productivity  aimed  at \nimproved delivery of public services. \n22.  The Outer Islands Transport Infrastructure Project is consistent with the three prongs, \nfocusing  on  improved  public  service  delivery,  poverty  reduction  in  the  outer  islands,  and \nenhancing the environment for private sector activities. Furthermore, by targeting the marine \ntransport  sector  and  related  infrastructure  needs,  the  Project  is  complementary  to  other \nexternally financed activities supporting the improvement of education and health infrastructure \nand the development of solar power facilities in the outer islands. It is also directly linked to \nADB\u2019s previous TA to the coconut and fisheries sectors. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002 Country Strategy and Program Update for RMI. Manila. ", "6 \n23.  The Government emphasizes the creation of economic opportunities for the outer island \ncommunities as part of the overall National Economic and Social Strategy (NESS I), thereby \nreducing the pressures for migration to the already overpopulated centers of Majuro and Ebeye. \nThe Government also emphasizes the need to improve transport to and from the outer islands \nwhile  at  the  same  time  reducing  the  costs  of  transport  subsidies.  However,  given  the \nremoteness of some of the islands, the Government recognizes that some subsidy element may \nneed to be retained for social purposes. To this end, the Government wishes to increase \nopportunities  for  private  sector  involvement  in  transport  services,  while  at  the  same  time \nensuring long-term sustainability and continuity of the shipping services. It is also a specific \ngovernment objective that the benefits of infrastructure investment in the outer islands should \naccrue directly to the outer island communities. \n24.  Specifically, the Government\u2019s transport sector strategy aims at (i) developing regular \nand reliable domestic air and sea transport services with minimum government subsidy and \nusing  a  private/public  sector  partnership;  (ii) strengthening  government  maintenance  of \ntransport  infrastructure  and  regulation  of  transport  safety,  and  promoting  reliability  of  sea \ntransport schedules; and (iii) encouraging centralization of cargo at outer island points of call \nwhere this improves transport efficiency and service reliability. The external assistance to the \nsector is reported in Appendix 5. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n25.  The objective of the Project is to contribute to poverty reduction in the outer islands. This \nwill be achieved by (i) improving transport services to and from the outer islands for the people \nand their produce, (ii) increasing accessibility to goods and basic services, and (iii) creating \nopportunities for more diversified economic activities and employment. The Project will help \nreduce the cost of imported goods to outer island communities, increase the opportunity to earn \nincome, create new employment opportunities, and improve access to basic services, such as \nhealth and education. The Project will also reduce the amount of subsidy required to provide \nouter island transport services, freeing budget resources for further poverty reduction activities \nand priority sector development, including health and education services. \n \n26.  Specifically, the Project will fund selected transport infrastructure, primarily of a marine \ncivil engineering nature, but also including complementary engineering and building works on \nland, that will yield savings in transport costs and provide safer and more reliable services. In \nturn, these will encourage increased economic production in the outer islands, will help limit \nmigration to Majuro and Ebeye, and will assist in the delivery of social programs. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n27.  The Project will comprise the following components: \n(i)  landing facilities (ship docks, small jetties, and boat channels) to expedite loading \nand unloading, and to reduce cargo spoilage and passenger discomfort and \ninjury; \n(ii)  warehousing,  mainly  for  copra,  but  also  for  general  inward  cargo  and  with \nancillary areas for radio communications, office, and community workroom; and ", "7 \nimprovement  to  tracks  to  facilitate  concentration  of  copra  collections  and \ndistribution of inward cargo at selected loading points; \n(iii)  navigation aids to enable access to landing points under low light conditions and \nat night, improving safety and eliminating overnight delays; and \n(iv)  extensions  and  general  improvements  to  selected  airstrips  where  there  are \nrunway length constraints. \nC.  Technical Justification \n1.  Landings \n28.  In a few places it would be possible to bring inter-atoll ships alongside for direct cargo \nand passenger transfer between ship and shore if a dock was constructed or an existing dock \nextended or repaired. This saves the time required to lighter goods between the ship and shore \non small boats, and runs less risk of cargo damage through rough handling, or contact with \nseawater  or  rain.  It  also  provides  easier  embarkation  and  disembarkation  for  passengers. \nHowever, there are only a few places where there is deep water sufficiently close inshore in a \nprotected situation where docks can be economically built. \n29.  In a larger number of situations, transfer of cargo has to be by small boat, with the ship \nat anchor or drifting offshore, either in the lagoon or on the ocean side of the land, depending on \naccess to the lagoon, the width of the reef shelf, and weather exposure. Often, cargo transfer is \nrestricted at low tide, with 4 to 6 hours of potential working time being lost in each tide cycle \nbecause of insufficient water depth for the lighters to reach the beach or to navigate shallows \nbetween the beach and reef edge. In some circumstances this situation can be improved \nthrough clearing of a beach channel, in some cases combined with construction of a protective \nbreakwater with the excavated material, and/or with a causeway extending from the beach and \na jetty for small boat use. \n2.  Warehouses and Tracks \n30.  Centralization of produce collection to a single location at each island stopping place can \nbe more efficient than the ship\u2019s boats working along the beach, collecting small amounts of \nproduce from individual growers. Successful centralization relies on a number of conditions, \nincluding (i) a good landing point that is central to the produce sources on each side, (ii) a \ncentral storage facility such as a warehouse, and (iii) a supportive commercial arrangement that \nmakes the centralization effort worthwhile to the grower. In most cases, the natural coral surface \nis  suitable  for  small  pickups  and  handcarts  with  only  clearing  of  vegetation  required. \nOccasionally, there will be a need to remove unsuitable material and locally import fill where \nthere is an organic soil cover or where the surface is soft sand. Otherwise, formation and \ncompaction of the surface is all that is required. \n \n3.  Navigation Aids \n31.  Lit beacons are needed to enable nighttime navigation through main reef passages and \nalong inner lagoon routes. Beacons, indicating the position of the main reef passage into the \nlagoon, are needed for daytime navigation at locations where there are insufficient physical \npoints  of  reference  from  the  surrounding  land  above  the  high  water  mark  and  where  the \npassage is either narrow, branching, or bending. The unmarked reef passages can only be ", "8 \nnavigated safely in daylight and, even then, shoals may not be clearly visible if the weather is \novercast or the surface is rough. The primary purpose of lit beacons is, however to provide for \nsafe passage and to save ship\u2019s time by enabling nighttime navigation. These lit beacons would \nbe solar powered to minimize operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. \n \n4.  Airstrip Extensions \n32.  Most atolls and islands have airstrips with weekly services, the traffic confined mainly to \nofficial or government passengers and higher-income residents or visitors. Cargo space is \nlimited and, economically, only mail and small high-value and light goods can be transported. \nWhile complementing rather than competing with the main seaborne services, the airstrips \nnevertheless play an important part in the transport system. The work involves clearing or \ntrimming vegetation along the runway and approaches, leveling and compaction of the runway \nstrip, supply of coral material from land-based sources for the runway running surface, edge \ndelineation, installation of wind sock, and construction of small ancillary buildings. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n33.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $10.0 million  equivalent.  The  foreign \nexchange cost, totaling $6.84 million equivalent, constitutes 68.4% of the total cost, and the \nlocal currency cost for expenditures on locally procured items accounts for the remaining 31.6%. \nThe cost estimates include provision for price escalation and physical contingencies and interest \non the ADB loan during construction. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1. The \ndescription and cost estimates for individual projects are in Appendix 6. \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency \nA.

Financing Plan \n34.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $7.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources to finance 100% of foreign exchange cost and 5.06% of the local currency cost; the \nGovernment will fund 94.94% of the local currency cost.3 The proposed loan is envisaged to \nhave a maturity period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and will carry interest at \nthe rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The Borrower will be the \nRMI. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total \nADB  6.84  0.16  7.00 \nGovernment  0.00  3.00  3.00 \n  Total     6.84     3.16  10.00 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Execution \n35.  MOTC will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. The secretary, MOTC, will \nassume overall responsibility for the implementation of the Project and for liaising with ADB. To \nmanage day-to-day implementation, MOTC will establish a project office to be headed by a full-\ntime project manager with qualifications and experience satisfactory to ADB. The office will be \nadequately staffed at all times with a competent project manager, project accountant, and \nsupporting personnel to undertake day-to-day activities such as recruitment and supervision of \nconsulting services, procurement of goods and services, contract management, accounting and \ndisbursement,  records,  and  reports.  The  project  office  will  be  in  operation  before  loan \nnegotiation and until December 2006, which is a few months after the Project\u2019s expected \nphysical  completion  date.  MOTC  will  be  assisted  by  consultants  in  preparing  engineering \ndesigns, supervising construction, and technical review. The consultants will be selected and \nappointed by February 2003. A contract under a single contract arrangement for the civil works \nis expected to be awarded by October 2003. \n36.  International  consultants,  who  will  be  engaged  by  MOTC,  will  manage  the  site \ninvestigation  contract,  undertake  conceptual  design  and  tender  preparation  for  the  main \ncontract, evaluate bids and make recommendations to MOTC and ADB on contractor selection, \nand supervise construction. \n \n37.  It is proposed that a project coordination committee be formed to facilitate exchange of \ninformation on the progress of the Project. The committee would include representatives of \nMOTC, as well as the ministries of Finance, Public Works, Internal Affairs/ Historic Preservation \nOffice,  Research  and  Development,  the  Marshall  Islands  Airport  Authority  (MIAA),  the \nEnvironmental Protection Authority (EPA), the mayors and local government councils of the \n                                                 \n3   The RMI uses the US dollar as its currency. \u201cLocal currency costs\u201d in this context mean costs of goods and \nservices that are procured locally. Because of the structure of the RMI economy, such costs have a substantial \nimport component, and therefore a high indirect foreign exchange cost. ", "10 \nislands concerned, and other government and nongovernment organization (NGO) personnel as \ndesirable. The committee would meet quarterly and on an ad hoc basis. \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n38.  The Project is expected to start in January 2003 and to be completed by 31 December \n2006. The implementation schedule, showing the various stages of the Project, is provided in \nAppendix 7. The length of the construction period is partly determined by weather conditions as \nwell as by the widely dispersed sites. The planned commencement of construction is during the \nfourth quarter of 2003 with completion by the end of 2006. \n \n3.  Procurement \n39.  All procurement under the Project will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  In  view  of  the  small  number  of  domestic  civil  engineering  contractors,  it  is \nanticipated  that  the  Project  will  be  let  as  a  single  major  construction  contract  of  about \n$7.2 million using international competitive bidding (ICB), a two-stage bidding procedure, to \nprovide  a  contract  of  sufficient  size  to  encourage  competitive  tendering  from  overseas \ncontractors, preferably in association with local contractors. This single contract would cover \ndocks, navigation aids, warehouses, channels, and airstrips.  \n40.  There  will  be  an  opportunity  for  suitably  qualified  local  construction  firms  to  either \npropose a joint venture with international firms, act as subcontractors, or bid for the main \ncontract. Subpackages of the main contract will include the design and construction of some of \nthe navigation markers, clearing and maintenance of airstrips, and supply of some of the \nhardware to be fitted to the upgraded and new structures. \n4.  Consulting Services \n41.  An international engineering firm will be engaged to act as engineer to the contract and \nto carry out design, preparation of tender documents and advertising of tenders, bid evaluation \nand  monitoring  of  the  site  investigation  works,  and  the  main  construction  contract.  A  site \ninvestigation contract will be let in advance of the main contract and prior to the engineering \ndesign. Submarine archaeological surveys will be conducted during this period in areas where \nthere is expectation of submarine artifacts of historic value. \n42.  A full technical proposal will be used. The consultants will be selected through the quality \nand cost-based selection method. It is estimated that about 75 person-months of consulting \nservices (43 for international and 32 for domestic consultants) will be required over the project \nperiod. The consulting firm is expected to provide secretarial and project accounting services on \nan intermittent basis over the construction period, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. \n43.  ADB  has  approved  advance  action  to  expedite  the  recruitment  of  the  international \nconsultants. Contracts with the consultants will be entered into as soon as the loan becomes \neffective. ADB has informed the Government that advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinance the Project or any part of it. \n ", "11 \n5.  Disbursement \n44.  The loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \ndated January 2001, as amended from time to time. For the international consulting services, \ndirect payment procedures will be used. \n \n6.  Land Acquisition \n45.  The Project involves modification to areas below the high water mark within the outer \nreef  of  each  island  or  atoll.  These  areas  are  seaward  extensions  of  the  land  ownership \nboundaries or weto. Land is also required for construction of warehouses and, in a few cases, \nfor development of tracks. Warehouses would be located on land that is currently clear of \nbuildings and none of the proposed works would involve resettlement. Furthermore, the Project \nhas a dozen reserve subprojects (Appendix 6) to replace subprojects if land issues emerge. \n7.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit \n46.  The  Government  has  undertaken  to  make  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nmonitoring  the  progress  of  project  implementation.  MOTC  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly \nreports covering physical progress, project accounts, and performance indicators. To facilitate \npostevaluation of the Project, MOTC will provide ADB with a completion report, within 3 months \nof the physical completion of the Project, on the execution and initial operation of the project \nfacilities, including the costs and compliance with the loan covenants. \n47.  MOTC  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records,  and  will  provide  ADB \nannually with audited accounts and financial statements related to the Project. The statements \nwill  be  audited  by  independent  auditors,  presented  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB,  and \nsubmitted to ADB within 9 months of the end of each fiscal year. The terms of reference for the \nindependent  auditor  will  be  subject  to  review  and  approval  by  ADB.  A  midterm  review  is \nenvisaged after 2 years to verify the status of the Project, its achievements against the program, \nand its costs against the budget. \n \n8.  Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation \n48.  The Government has agreed to undertake, with assistance from the consultants, benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation activities to ensure that the facilities to be improved under the Project \nare managed efficiently and that their benefits are maximized. The Government and ADB have \nagreed on the nature of the data to be collected, the methodology for analysis, and the reporting \nrequirements; these are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System \n(Operations Manual 22, August 2002). \n \n9.  Operation and Maintenance \n49.  The responsibility for management and O&M of the project components will be assigned \nunder the pertinent line agencies immediately after completion of the Project. These agencies \nare MIAA (airstrips), MOTC, the Ministry of Public Works, and the Marshall Islands Ports \nAuthority (MIPA) (wharves). It is envisaged that an outer island infrastructure levy applied to \ninter-atoll  shipping  on  ships  docking  at  Majuro  and  Ebeye,  collected  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment by MIPA, will be used to fund maintenance of marine infrastructure and product \ncentralization  facilities  such  as  warehouses  and  tracks,  while  a  surcharge  on  domestic ", "12 \npassenger fares would be levied for airstrip maintenance. The Government has adopted a \npolicy of engaging the private sector for maintenance of government assets. \n \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n50.  A TA grant of $250,000 is attached to the loan. The TA will assist MOTC and AMI in \nimproving  the  delivery  of  sea  and  air  transport  services  by  developing  their  business, \noperational, and management information systems and practice, and in the long-term planning \nof their fleet maintenance, disposals, and acquisitions. The TA will also assist MOTC in its \nadministration  of  private  sector  contracts  for  shipping  services,  and  in  the  operation  of \ngovernment shipping. Consultants for the nonlending assistance will be selected through the \nquality and cost-based selection method. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $315,000 \nequivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $235,000. ADB will provide the TA as a grant \nfinanced by the ADB-funded TA program to cover the foreign exchange costs and $15,000 of \nthe local cost component. The Government will provide the remaining $65,000. The details of \nthe TA are in Appendix 8. \n \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Technical Aspects \n51.  Technical  risks  relate  to  (i) constructability,  (ii) maintenance  requirements,  and \n(iii) extraordinary damage from cyclone or tsunami events. The technology for onshore works \n(warehouses,  track  improvements,  airstrip  extensions)  is  straightforward  and  within  the \ncapability  of  small  contractors  or  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  assuming  appropriate \nengineering specifications and levels of supervision. Marine works carry more risk with regard to \nfounding conditions for docks and jetties (investigation has been restricted to visual observation \nand simple soundings in the project preparatory TA), and littoral transport of sediment (although \nthis is mitigated by specifying open structure).4 \n52.  Where  isolated  cargo  transfer  platforms  on  the  ocean-side  reef  edge  have  been \nproposed, there is a greater risk in construction, maintenance, and operation of the facility. \nThere may be a need to substitute another project should the design stage site investigation \nreveal problems that render the proposal technically or economically infeasible. Provision has \nbeen made for a number of fully appraised back-up subprojects should this eventuality occur. \n53.  All ocean-side structures and all navigation aids will be susceptible to damage or loss in \nthe event of a major cyclone event or, for shore structures, a large tsunami. The RMI has a \nrelatively low, but not negligible, risk of cyclone events. \n \nB.  Policy and Institutional Aspects \n54.  The financial and economic benefits of the project rely partly upon the savings that are \ngenerated  by  improved  scheduling  and  fewer  delays  due  to  tide,  weather,  and  daylight \nconditions,  being  translated  into  improved  ship  utilization,  lower  shipping  costs,  and  more \nregular and reliable ship calls. To the extent that these occur, the benefits of the Project will be \n                                                 \n4  Littoral drift is the movement of sediments caused by wave action along the coastline. On an open coast, a jetty\u2019s \nstructure extends into a body of water, and is designed to prevent such build-up of littoral materials in a channel. ", "13 \ncaptured by the outer island population. This flow of benefits to the outer island people will also \nrely  upon  the  responsiveness  of  freight  rates  and  fares  to  these  lower  costs,  and  the \nGovernment passing on part of its cost savings to the users of the service. \n55.  The competitive franchise system for shipping operators and the performance reporting \nregime proposed for the government shipping service together should reduce the risks of project \nbenefits not being achieved; the proposed nonlending assistance is designed to reinforce the \ninstitutional capacity to perform these tasks. \n56.  There have been past experiences of warehouses remaining unused due to uncertain \nownership status and management responsibility. The Project will address this problem by \nestablishing clear ownership of the warehouses (MOTC is the proposed owner), with the ability \nto contract management to local government or the private sector as circumstances permit. \n \nC.  Poverty Intervention and Social Impact \n1.  Poverty Intervention \n57.  The outer island communities are the people whose incomes, livelihood, quality of life, \nand access to services and to greater economic opportunities stand to be most affected by the \nProject. Where docks, jetties, and beach channels are contemplated, the sites of these facilities \nare either already in customary use for a similar purpose or are in new locations that are \nexpected to find agreement with the customary owners of land and the coastal zone. \n58.  At the national level, while the RMI has a relatively high per capita income owing mainly \nto the historically high levels of financial assistance from the US, outer island populations have \nsignificantly  lower  incomes  than  either  the  urban  centers  or  the  islands  in  receipt  of \ncompensation payments. Outer islands also have relatively few cash income opportunities, are \nvulnerable to natural disasters, and are disadvantaged through their isolation. One of the main \ncriteria for project selection has been the destination islands\u2019 relative lower income. The islands \nselected by the Project have a weighted average share of households with an annual cash \nincome lower than $1,000 ($0.38 per capita per day) of 37.8%, and a weighted average share of \nhouseholds with an annual income lower than $3,000 of 44.3%, against 13.6% and 27.5%, \nrespectively, for the whole of the RMI.5 For the nonproject islands, the respective figures are \nonly 3% below $1,000 and 10% below $3,000. This clearly demonstrates the relative poverty \nexperienced in the islands of the project area. \n59.  The Project will assist in reducing isolation and lowering transport costs, which are \namong  the  necessary  conditions  for  increased  economic  participation  of  relatively  poor \nhouseholds. The cash income activities of the poor that will benefit from the Project include \ncopra  production,  fresh  fish  marketing,  surplus  island  produce  marketing  (e.g.,  pumpkins, \nbreadfruit, melons, bananas), and sale of handicrafts. Through reductions in ship operating \ncosts,  the  Project  will  help  lower  passenger  fares  and  freight  rates,  which  will  increase \ndisposable incomes for poor outer island residents as well as induce additional economic \nproduction. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9, and more \ndetails are available in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n60.  It has been clearly established that regular and reliable transport services for all forms of \nproduce,  general  import  cargo,  and  passengers  is  a  key  need  to  support  the  social  and \n                                                 \n5  1999 Population and Housing Census. ", "14 \neconomic welfare of remote and poverty-stricken island populations. On the more productive \natolls supporting larger populations, a four to six-week frequency of service is desirable whereas \nthe service over the recent past has been 4 months or longer and erratic. From analysis of past \ncopra production, cargo volumes, and passenger records, it is clear that there is a latent \ndemand for an improved level of service. \n61.  More frequent and reliable transport services will assist in: \n(i)  improving  access  for  the  remote  households  to  all  potential  pro-poor  basic \nservices  through  (a)  easier  travel  and  transport  to  and  from  the  islands  by \nMinistry of Internal Affairs mobile teams, health and education personnel, and \nother officials for training, performance monitoring, and public awareness; (b) \neasier access for supplies of materials and drugs to schools and clinics; and (c) \nreliable transport for schoolchildren traveling back and forth for the holidays; \n(ii)  enhancing the opportunity for new ventures to be developed by poor households \nin the knowledge that transport will be available to ship produce, goods, and/or \npeople in and out on a more regular basis; \n(iii)  reducing the middleperson\u2019s rent and allow higher assigns for the farm producers \nand lower prices for the poor consumers in the outer islands; \n(iv)  implementing other pro-poor development projects, e.g., outer island education, \nhealth,  and  energy  sector  projects,  through  improved  shipping  services  for \ntransporting materials and skilled staff; \n(v)  providing  a  greater  selection  of  store  goods  at  more  competitive  prices  for \npeople; \n(vi)  providing a lifeline service to outer islands, since the poor households cannot \nafford airfares, and  any delay or interruption to shipping services places lives \nand livelihoods at risk; \n(vii)  slowing the decline in atoll populations, many of them marginally viable even \nnow, and with increasing levels of dependency; and \n(viii)  increasing opportunities, especially for the poor, vulnerable youth for which the \nlack of opportunities would otherwise drive poor younger people away from the \nouter islands in search of jobs. \n2.  Social Impact \n62.  Social Services. The proposed Project addresses some important concerns of those \nministries responsible for essential, pro-poor social services and outer island development, \nparticularly the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Health. \nThese ministries require regular contact with, and travel of staff to, the outer islands for the \ndelivery  and  monitoring  of  social  services.  The  implementation  of  these  projects  will  be \nfacilitated by better transport services for the shipment of materials and personnel. \n63.  Gender Issues. Men of working age tend to look for job opportunities in Majuro and \noverseas. Women tend to remain in the outer islands to look after the elderly and the younger \npopulation,  thus  increasing  the  women\u2019s  workload  in  the  household  as  well  as  in  cash-", "15 \ngenerating activities. There is a division of labor between men and women in island subsistence \nand  income-generating  activities  of  the  poor.  Women  and  men  both  participate  in  copra \nproduction and the cultivation of produce for sale in Majuro and Ebeye.6 Women produce \nhandicrafts, and men are responsible for fishing. The Project will facilitate supply of goods \n(mostly food) and provision of better basic services for women and the vulnerable groups in the \nouter islands. There are no sociocultural groups in a vulnerable position in the context of the \nProject, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples will not be triggered by the Project. \n64.  Cash-Earning Activities. Construction and maintenance of project infrastructure will \ncreate  some  cash-earning  activities  for  the  poor  in  the  outer  islands.  The  transport \nimprovements will provide increased opportunities for participation in cash income production \nthat will benefit the poor in the outer islands. \n65.  Education Issues. The subdistrict centers of Jaluit and Wotje support high schools and \ndraw  their  students  from  within  the  subdistricts,  including  neighboring  atolls,  setting  up  a \ndemand for passenger transport at the start and end of each semester. Schools require inputs \nof educational materials on a regular basis and, occasionally, building materials. Improved \ntransport will allow greater contact with the isolated schools, thereby helping raise standards \nthrough more frequent teacher training and performance monitoring. \n66.  Health Issues. There are 54 health centers spread through the islands of the project \narea, each staffed with a health assistant. At present, none of these centers has cold chain \nfacilities. The health assistant provides only basic health care services and none of the centers \nis equipped to handle surgery or inpatient treatment. The lack of refrigeration and problems with \nshipping and transport generally often mean that clinics run out of pharmacy medicines and \neven primary health care is not available or is unsatisfactory. At present, the difficulties in \ntransport mean that only the most serious cases are taken to Majuro or Ebeye for emergency \ntreatment. This means that the treatment is often too late, causing additional suffering and, \nsometimes,  unnecessary  deaths  to  outer  island  patients.  Transport  requirements  of \ndispensaries  include  airfreight  of  pharmaceuticals  and  fragile  medical  equipment,  and  sea \nfreight of bulky, lower-value and more robust supplies and building materials. More regular and \nreliable transport will improve lifeline services for the outer islands and will reduce the risk of \nunnecessary  deaths  in  cases  where  urgent  treatment  is  required.  Infections  with  human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are increasing \nrapidly in the Pacific. The construction workers associated with the Project are a potential \nsource of transmission for HIV/AIDS to the RMI. To reduce the risk of spreading HIV/AIDS, the \ncontractor will be required to provide HIV/AIDS education and condoms to the construction \nworkers. \n67.  Resettlement Issues. The Project will have no direct resettlement effects. In the longer \nterm, successful implementation of the Project will assist in reducing the drift of population to \nMajuro and Ebeye through improvement of the opportunities in the outer islands for cash-\nincome employment and reduction in the sense of isolation and unreliability of transport links. \nBefore the final list of subprojects is prepared for tendering, on-site investigations will be carried \nout for each subproject to ascertain that no involuntary resettlement will be involved. In the \nevent  that  a  proposed  subproject  is  found,  during  site  investigation,  to  involve  involuntary \nresettlement, it may be replaced with a subproject that will be subject likewise to the same on-\n                                                 \n6  The men collect coconuts, while both men and women are involved in husking, shelling, and drying. Men dig the \nland while women are involved in planting and harvesting the produce. ", "16 \nsite screening process that will not involve involuntary resettlement. MOTC will be responsible \nfor screening the subproject and for obtaining clearance from appropriate agencies and parties. \n \n3.  Financial Assessment \n68.  Full recovery of the capital costs of the Project from user fees is probably unrealistic in \nview of the limited financial resources of outer island communities. The Government has offered \nto  budget  $50,000  per  year  for  the  Project\u2019s  O&M  and  to  finance  any  shortfall  of  funds. \nFurthermore, the new financial provision of the Compact Agreement with the United States will \nprovide for a trust fund specifically earmarked for infrastructure O&M. However, there should be \nprovision to at least provide a revenue stream that covers the ongoing O&M costs of the Project. \nIt  is  envisaged  that  the  project  infrastructure  will  be  owned  by  MOTC  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment, and that MOTC will be responsible for allocating funds to maintain the facilities in \noperational condition. \n \n69.  It seems impractical to collect revenue from cargo interests or passengers at the outer \nisland ports but, as most inter-atoll shipping originates at Majuro or Ebeye, a levy at these ports \nof origin is proposed as a means of funding maintenance requirements. It is further proposed \nthat MIPA act as a collection agent for MOTC in return for an administration fee. The levy would \nprobably be on a ship call and/or cargo and passenger throughput basis with the aim of being \nrevenue neutral (i.e., the levy adjusted annually to reflect the medium-term maintenance funding \nneeds). \n \n4.  Economic Assessment \n70.  The economic evaluation of the proposed Project is based on a comparison of the \u201cwith\u201d \nand \u201cwithout\u201d project scenarios. The components of the Project are integrated and mutually \ncomplementary. Providing better navigation aids and marks is insufficient on its own since the \nbenefits of easier access to lagoons provided by the navigation aids can only be realized in full if \nthe vessels can approach closer to shore through cleared passages or come alongside to the \nisland wharves. \n71.  Without  the  Project,  the  inter-atoll  shipping  services  will  continue  to  be  subject  to \nnighttime navigation and tidal restrictions that delay or interrupt vessel passage between ports \nof call, and which cause delay or damage to cargo transfer at ports of call. Incomes for outer \nisland families, being largely dependent on selling produce when the ship calls, will continue to \nbe  irregular  and  uncertain  making  household  budgeting  difficult,  especially  in  respect  of \npayments of large items such as school fees. Opportunities for increasing production will be \nseverely constrained. Store good prices will continue to be high as there will be no competition, \nand choice and availability of goods will be limited. Access to basic services will continue to be \nrestricted, families will not be able to improve their living standards, poverty will get worse, and \nthe poorest families in the country will be further disadvantaged. \n72.  With the Project, most of these constraints will be overcome. Delays and interruptions to \nservices will be reduced, such that savings can be made in ship operating costs and services \nprovided with fewer vessels. In this case, it has been assumed that redundant vessels would be \nsold or deployed elsewhere. A case may also be made for savings from the reduced risk of \nvessels going aground and suffering damage or loss. Where the Project allows ships to lie \nalongside, there are savings in cargo damage from rough handling and water damage. Finally, \nthe reliability will induce increased economic activity and incremental transport demand. It will \nenable families to increase their production and generate regular and increased incomes with ", "17 \nwhich they will be able to improve their conditions and standards of living and to meet vital \nperiodic payments such as school fees. \n73.  The evaluation has been carried out over a 20-year investment period which generally \ncorresponds to the design life of the navigation marks (25 years for civil works and five to 10 \nyears for lights), the jetties (25 years for good maintenance, 15 years for poor maintenance). \nThe Project achieves a 14.5% economic internal rate of return. The sensitivity analysis, given in \nTable  3,  demonstrates  that  the  Project  is  robust  and  remains  financially  viable  even  with \nadverse movements in some parameters such as lower project benefits, increase in capital cost, \nand delay in project implementation. \nTable 3: Sensitivity Test \nSensitivity Test  EIRR  Sensitivity  NPV  Sensitivity \n(%)  Indicator  ($ million)  Indicator \nBase Case  14.5    1.33   \n  10% increase in costs  13.0  -1.02  0.58  -5.61 \n  10% decrease in benefits  13.0  -1.02  0.53  -6.01 \n  1 year delay in construction  14.2    1.12   \n  All tests combined  11.3    (0.40)   \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n74.  The Project will contribute both directly and indirectly to poverty reduction in the project \nareas. The discounted cash-flow analysis indicates that a total of around one third of the \naverage annual benefits will accrue directly to the people of the outer islands through (i) better \nmarket  access  and  increased  incomes  from  local  produce  sales  (10%  of  total  benefits); \n(ii) passenger time savings, increased safety, and less cargo damage (25% of total benefits); \nand (iii) income earned from employment during project implementation. Less cargo damage \nwill also benefit merchants, the public, and ship operators. Reduced operating costs, accounting \nfor around half of the total benefits, will accrue directly to ship operators and to government \nthrough reduced operating subsidies. Outer island communities will benefit indirectly through (i) \nlower real fares and cargo charges; (ii) lower prices for store goods from on-board merchants \nresulting from increased competition; and (iii) less risk of stock loss and damage through poor \nhandling. \n75.  Many unquantifiable benefits accruing to the outer island communities have not been \nincorporated into the cash-flow analysis. In particular, these are the social and welfare benefits \nto be derived from (i) improved access to medical, education, public awareness, and other \ngovernment service teams; (ii) easier and more frequent interaction with other parts of the \ncountry; and (iii) better outer island project implementation, as supplies and technical support \ncan more easily be sent to project sites. The economic analysis is given in Appendix 10. More \ndetails are available in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n5.  Environmental Assessment \n76.  The  EPA  is  the  agency  charged  with  environmental  reporting  and  clearance  of \nengineering works. The Project is classified Category B, and an initial environmental impact \nexamination  was  completed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Impact  Assessment \nGuidelines  for  Infrastructure  Projects  and  the  requirements  of  government  legislation  and \nregulations,  specifically  the  National  Environmental  Protection  Act  1984;  the  Coastal ", "18 \nConservation Act 188 (Section 27); and the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, \n1994, issued by the EPA.  \n77.  The nature and scale of the works proposed are generally judged to be of relatively low  \nenvironmental impact, for the following reasons: \n(i)  works that have the potential to set up high water velocities through constriction \nof flow, or connection of water bodies with significant hydraulic gradients, have \nbeen avoided; \n(ii)  projects  are  mainly  sited  at  locations  already  used  as  landings  for \npassenger/cargo vessels, and therefore are already subject to minor levels of \npollution (pristine locations have been avoided in most cases); and \n(iii)  the extent of coastline modification is very small in comparison with the coastline \nlength,  and  works  are  situated  either  where  there  are  high  rates  of  water \nexchange  and  flushing  within  lagoons  or  on  the  ocean-side  where  the  reef \nshelves quickly to deep water. \n78.  Effects on coral reef systems will be minimized by designing minimal footprint structures \nwhere possible (e.g., cantilever piles instead of mass gravity structures for reef pass navigation \naids), utilizing existing channel locations where possible, limiting excavation and deposition \nwork on the seabed to a minimum (breakwaters have not been pursued for this reason), and \nrequiring contractors to implement a construction and environmental management plan. The \nsummary initial environmental examination is given in Appendix 11. \n \nD.  Overall Assessment \n79.  Transport services serve as the lifeline to the outer islands. Shipping brings in essential \ngoods and services and takes out island produce from which the people earn a substantial \nportion of their incomes. Shipping also brings in government services and supplies, particularly \nto  the  schools  and  health  clinics.  Shipping  provides  an  essential  service  to  families  by \ntransporting children to and from secondary schools and colleges elsewhere in the RMI, and in \nproviding links for everyone to the urban centers and the outside world. Air services provide \npassenger and freight transport as well emergency evacuation services for sick and vulnerable \npeople. \n80.  The major risks associated with project implementation and subsequent realization of \nproject  objectives  include  failure  of  the  Government  to  implement  an  efficient  system  of \ncontracted shipping services or to optimize the size and number of vessels in service. Other \nrisks include failure to implement a satisfactory system for funding maintenance of the Project \nand prudent and timely allocation of the revenue for maintenance operations when required. \nThere are some risks that elements of the infrastructure, in particular the proposed warehouses, \nwill be unused due to lack of satisfactory local management and commercial arrangements. \nThere are also risks of vandalism, neglect, or diversion for other purposes of detachable and \nmobile  equipment  provided  for  the  project  (e.g.,  navigation  lights).  The  project  design \nincorporates safeguards to minimize these risks. Furthermore, lending (of which the project \nimplementation  consulting  services  terms  of  reference  are  found  in  Appendix  12)  and \nnonlending technical assistance will assist the implementation of the Project. ", "19 \n81.  The civil works under the Project for the most part involve improvement to outer island \nlandings  that  are  already  utilized  by  inter-atoll  shipping  and  in  most  cases  have  already \nintroduced some physical modification to the natural environment. Where beach channels are \nprovided, in several cases, this involves the widening and deepening of an existing channel. \nSimilarly, most of the jetty facilities comprise repair or extension to existing structures. For those \ncases  where  physical  modification  is  proposed  at  new  sites,  the  initial  environmental \nexamination has concluded that none of the project components will involve major adverse \nenvironmental effects. \n82.  Notwithstanding ADB\u2019s internal requirements for environmental assessment, many of the \nsubprojects will require environmental permits from the EPA under the RMI\u2019s environmental \nlegislation. By law, this environmental analysis must be undertaken by specialists independent \nof the project designers and constructors. Provision has been made in the project costs for the \nengagement of a specialist consultant to undertake this work. \n \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n83.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents: \n(i)  The Government will finance any shortfall of funds, after the collection of user \nlevies, to ensure effective and efficient O&M of the Project over its economic life \nof 25 years. \n(ii)  The Project will be implemented in accordance with existing environmental laws, \nregulations, and standards of the RMI, and ADB's guidelines, in particular, ADB's \nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the subprojects do not result in any losses that \nwould trigger ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Before tendering of the \ncivil work contract, on-site investigations will be carried out for each subproject in \norder to ascertain that no involuntary resettlement will be involved. In the event \nthat  a  proposed  subproject  is  found,  during  site  investigation,  to  involve \ninvoluntary resettlement, it will be replaced with a subproject that will be subject \nlikewise to the same on-site screening process and that will not involve any \ninvoluntary resettlement. MOTC will be responsible for the subproject screening \nand for obtaining clearance from appropriate agencies and/or parties. \n(iv)  The Government will maintain a dialogue with ADB on the status of relevant \ntransport  issues,  including  maritime  safety,  tariffs,  and  user  charges,  sector \nfunding, institutional organization, and external assistance. \n(v)  The  Government  will  budget  adequate  counterpart  funding  for  project \nimplementation in accordance with the financing plan, as well as an annual \nappropriation of $50,000 for the O&M of the Project\u2019s infrastructure. \n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  construction  workers  associated  with  the \nProject are provided with HIV/AIDS education and protection. ", "20 \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that at least one private operator will participate in \nthe shipping franchise service. \n(viii)  The  Government  will  maintain,  during  project  implementation,  an  adequately \nstaffed  project  office  headed  by  an  appropriate  project  manager  with \nqualifications and experience acceptable to ADB. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n86.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB, and acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 5,304,000 to the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands  for  the  Outer  Island  Transport  Infrastructure  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest \ncharge at the rate

report submitted in August 1995 gave recommendations for investment in \nmarine, road and air transport infrastructure, mainly for main port and airport works. \nIncluded  were  outline  recommendations  for  outer  island  transport  infrastructure \nimprovements. A project loan was not proceeded with at that time as the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands (RMI) was undergoing a period of economic transition as a result of the \nimminent  cessation  of  United  States  government  Compact  Agreement  financial \nassistance and Asian Development Bank (ADB) efforts at that time were directed toward \nimproving fiscal management capacity. \n \nSeptember 1995  TA 2756-RMI, Institutional Strengthening of the Transport Sector, for $575,000 approved \n  on 8 September 1995, oversaw the formation in 1997 of two self-funding government \n  authorities, the Marshall Islands Port Authority (MIPA) and the Marshall Islands Airport \nAuthority (MIAA), and a road trust fund for road maintenance cost recovery. \n \nJanuary 1997  Loan 1513-RMI, Public Sector Reform Program, for $12.0 million, was approved on 30 \nJanuary 1997. \n \nMarch 1998  TA 2994-RMI, Coconut Sector Development Strategy, for $70,000, was approved on 10 \nMarch 1998, copra being the main export product from the outer islands.

Sector Description \n1.  Transport Planning and Coordination \n1.  Several government agencies and special purpose authorities share responsibility for \nthe transport sector. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) is formally at \nthe apex of transport administration but does not have any responsibilities with regard to roads \nand road traffic. Its planning role is limited to ports and shipping and, to a lesser extent, civil \naviation. Its policy formulation role is relatively small. Essentially, MOTC is responsible for the \nregulation of domestic and overseas shipping, organization of the operation of the government \nshipping fleet, and regulation of air safety through the Department of Civil Aviation. Road traffic \nregulation  and  fire  services  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Commissioner  for  Public  Safety. \nKwajalein Atoll, although subject to the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) government \nadministration,  in  practice  maintains  a  high  degree  of  autonomy,  with  Kwajalein  Atoll \nDevelopment Authority and the Ebeye Port Commission having significant roles in the transport \nsector. \n2.  Transport  infrastructure  is  provided  and  maintained  by  the  Marshall  Islands  Port \nAuthority (MIPA) and the Marshall Islands Airport Authority (MIAA) in respect of main ports \n(Majuro,  Ebeye,  and  Jaluit)  and  Amata  Kabua  International  Airport  (Majuro).  Outer  island \nairstrips and roads are built and maintained by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) while outer \nisland marine infrastructure construction is undertaken by the private sector, under written or \nunwritten  contracts,  directly  to  government  agencies  such  as  the  Marshall  Islands  Marine \nResources Authority (MIMRA) or the local government. \n \n2.  Transport Infrastructure \na.  Ports \n3.  Operation of the main ports is now the responsibility of MIPA, the result of restructuring \ninitiatives recommended and assisted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). MIPA controls \nthe operation of Delap and Uliga ports on Majuro, Jabwor port on Jaluit Atoll and, nominally, of \nthe port of Ebeye. Apart from the MIMRA fishing jetties, outer island jetties and landings are not \nunder  any  formal  control  with  regard  to  their  operation  or  maintenance,  although  local \ngovernment councils have a natural interest in the adequacy of the facilities provided. \n4.  MIMRA  operates  fish  bases,  some  with  jetties  or  pontoons,  funded  by  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency over a 10-year period at Arno Atoll (Ine and Arno), Likiep, \nAilinglaplap  Atoll  (Buoj),  Namu  Atoll,  and  Aur  Atoll  (Tabal).  A  new  facility  is  soon  to  be \nconstructed at Maloelap Atoll (Taroa). The facilities provided vary but can include a building with \nchiller room, office, and equipment store. At Arno, Ine, Buoj, and Likiep there is a jetty for small \nboats to carry local fish catch to Majuro or Ebeye and, in some cases, a smaller jetty for use by \nlocal fishermen has been provided but apparently never used. Namu has a pontoon, while Tabal \nhas no jetty and the facility planned for Tabal is similar. \n5.  Apart from the MIMRA jetties and the dock at Jabwor, the outer atolls generally have no \nother jetties or beach ramps to support passenger and cargo movements. Exceptions are Bikini, \nEnewetak, and Rongelap where there has been substantial new construction as part of the \nrehabilitation of these atolls and preparation for rehabilitation by the displaced former residents ", "28  Appendix 4 \nand their descendants. There are a few locations where wartime jetties and seaplane ramps are \nusable or could be made usable. \n \nb.  Shipping \n6.  Shipping is the dominant mode of transport between the main centers and the outer \natolls. Historically, MOTC operated three Micro class passenger cargo vessels of 56 meters \nlength that were part of a larger fleet distributed among the United States former trust territories \nat the time of independence. These vessels were phased out of operation between 1995 and \n1998. The service was supplemented by a new vessel in 1996, the Juk Ae, which operated until \nit was lost in 1998, and by a larger sister ship the Ribuuk Ae in 1996 which is still in service, but \nwhich was under repair between 1998 and January 2001. \n7.  Following recommendations of an ADB-funded TA project,1 MOTC contracted Pacific \nInternational Inc. to operate a cargo/passenger service to a group of atolls for a three-year term, \nusing  the  Mercy  K,  a  42  meter  dredger  converted  to  carry  cargo  and  passengers,  which \ncommenced service in October 1999. This was supplemented by the Ministry of Resources and \nDevelopment\u2019s landing craft Jeljelet Ae chartered by MOTC from June 2000 to January 2001. \n8.  In early 2001, under Taipei,China funding, MOTC acquired three vessels to provide a \ngovernment  shipping  service.  These  are  the  Landrik  and  Litakbouki,  both  general \npassenger/cargo vessels and the Jobake, a small tanker vessel. The first two vessels, together \nwith the Ribuuk Ae, since returned to service, are intended for deployment on contracted \nservices to private operators, which together with the service provided by the Mercy K, will \nprovide a comprehensive service to most atolls and islands. The operators have all been \nselected and are Marshall Islands trading companies. A smaller passenger cargo vessel, the \nBokenieb, is intended to be run as a government-operated service to the more outlying and \nsmaller population atolls in the Western region. This vessel was transferred to MOTC by the \nMarshall  Islands  Development  Bank.  Some  minor  modifications  have  been  made  under \nTaipei,China funding. \n \nc.  Civil Aviation \n9.  AMI is the only domestic carrier and has a fleet of two Dornier 228 twin engine turboprop \naircraft (approximately 10 years old), together with a BN Islander which it acquired in 2000 but \nwhich has yet to be brought into service. The Dorniers are at a stage where they require heavy \nmaintenance so that they can continue in service, and the company expects that this will give an \nexpected further economic life of 10 years. The Dorniers fly domestic sectors mainly at a weekly \nfrequency, apart from Kwajalein (5 days a week) and Jaluit (twice a week), together with a \nweekly service to Tarawa (Kiribati). The Director of Civil Aviation reports to the secretary of \nMOTC and is responsible for aviation regulation and safety. \n \nB.  Government Policies and Plans \n10.  There  is  no  current  formal  statement  of  government  policy  in  the  transport  sector. \nHowever, the following general policy principles for national development, for the transport \nsector and in relation to the outer islands appear to be accepted. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Marshall Islands for Institutional Strengthening of the \nTransport Sector. Manila. ", "  Appendix 4  29 \n11.  General  policies\u2014improved  self-reliance,  stabilization  of  government  finances  and \nimproved financial management; efficiency within the Government and freedom of the public \nservice  from  undue  political  interference;  encouragement  of  the  private  sector;  and \nestablishment of an intergenerational trust fund. \n12.  Outer islands\u2014capacity building for outer island local governments to be better able to \nmanage their affairs and to be accountable for expenditure; devolution of responsibility to local \ngovernments for public asset maintenance once capacity and accountability are assured; and \nestablishment of outer island trust funds to provide a more secure financial base for social \nprograms. \n13.  Transport sector\u2014development of reliable domestic air and sea transport services with \nminimum government subsidy and using private/public sector partnerships; strengthening of \ngovernment  maintenance  of  transport  infrastructure  and  regulation  of  transport  safety; \npromotion of reliability of sea transport service schedules; and encouragement for centralization \nof cargo at outer island points of call where this improves transport efficiency and service \nreliability. \n \nC.  Lessons Learned \n14.  Experience  with  the  shipping  franchise  scheme  demonstrates  that  a  competitive \ntendering system to minimize subsidy payments and to remove shipping operations from direct \ngovernment operation is feasible but that financial capacity may be a barrier to entry. In such a \nsituation the Government\u2019s move to acquire new vessels and lease these to the private sector is \na rational one, in that it allows smaller companies to enter the market without having to face the \nlarge  capital  outlay  of  vessel  purchase.  However,  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  such \narrangements do not advantage operators who lease back a government vessel over those who \nsupply their own. It is likewise important that other agencies of government do not operate \nsubsidized shipping services in the franchise area, if the scheme is to succeed. \n15.  Another aspect of the shipping franchise service that requires review is the creation of \nlocal monopolies where a single operator is contracted to service an island group over a full \nthree-year contract period and the monopoly position this can create in the supply of imported \nmerchandise.  This  is  particularly  so  when  the  shipping  operator  is  also  a  local  merchant \ncompany. Rotation of service areas is a way of avoiding this tendency, and the tendering should \nbe broadened to include overseas operators. \n \nD.  Asian Development Bank Sector Strategy and Policy Dialogue \n16.  With Japanese assistance in the road sector and proposed assistance from Taipei,China \nfor improving airport and aviation related infrastructure, ADB is focusing its attention on the port \nsector in the outer islands and related infrastructure needs of the outer islands. Such a strategy \navoids duplication and is directly linked to ADB\u2019s support to the coconut and fisheries sectors. \nThis is consistent with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy by improving infrastructure in the more \nvulnerable outer islands. \n17.  ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government has covered (i) investment priorities and \npoverty focus, (ii) creation of opportunities for the private sector to participate in the domestic \nshipping service, (iii) institutional strengthening within MOTC for shipping service operational \nand financial management, and (iv) cost-recovery principles and mechanisms. An action plan \nwas agreed for implementation prior to loan approval. ", "30  Appendix 4 \n1.  Investment Priorities and Poverty Focus \n18.  The  priorities  of  the  Government  are  to  return  the  benefits  of  the  infrastructure \ninvestment to the outer islands. Project benefits will accrue directly to the users of the transport \nservices in the form of time savings, improved regularity and reliability, safety in embarkation/ \ndisembarkation, and reduced cargo damage. However, the larger portion of benefits arise as \nsavings in ship delay that must be allowed to flow through into a smaller shipping fleet and/or \nincreased services if these benefits are to be captured. There is a risk that the operating \nefficiencies  will  be  wasted  on  additional  slack  time  in  port,  particularly  if  there  is  limited \ncommercial discipline in the operation of the service. \n19.  Policy dialogue with the Government has focused on ensuring, first, that project benefits \nare captured and, second, that the benefits are passed on to the inhabitants of the outer islands. \nEnsuring the efficiency of the shipping operation and flexibility to adapt to changing market \nconditions  is  recognized  as  being  essential  to  the  former  objective,  and  a  system  of \nperformance monitoring and target setting is to be introduced for the government shipping \noperation. This will include a start-of-year \u201cstatement of intent\u201d prepared by the shipping unit \nwithin MOTC in which the performance indicators and targets for the year will be agreed with \nthe Minister, and an end-of-year \u201cstatement of service performance\u201d that reports on the degree \nof achievement of the targets and corrective actions where problems have been encountered.  \n20.  Navigation Aids. Apart from some existing navigation marks for the main reef passages \ninto Majuro and Kwajalein Atolls, there are very few navigation aids for inter- and intra-atoll \nshipping. A lack of navigation aids limits ship passage in many places to favorable tide, weather, \nand daylight conditions. Construction of solar-powered lit beacons at the main reef passes, \nwithin the lagoons, and at landing points will enable substantial savings in ship operating time \nand either a reduction in the fleet size required to service the islands or an increase in the \nservice frequency, or both. \n21.  Docks, Jetties, and Boat Channels. These facilities will be improved at a number of \nlocations where large volumes of produce and passengers are loaded, or where there are \nsubstantial concentrations of population that are difficult to service because of tidal restrictions. \nOften up to six hours, or half of the tidal cycle, is lost because the water depths are too shallow \nfor small boats to carry cargo or passengers between ship and shore. Another factor is weather, \nand locations facing the easterly quarter and unprotected by land can be difficult to access \nbecause of wave action. The solutions to these problems are to excavate small boat channels \nacross reef flats, to build ship docks or boat jetties, or combinations of these according to the \nnature of the site.  \n22.  The largest time savings can be achieved by building a ship dock at which the larger \ninter-atoll  vessels  can  berth  and  transfer  passengers  and  cargo  directly  to  land,  thereby \navoiding the need to use small boats. There are a few locations where existing jetties that have \nbeen damaged, become silted, or were constructed originally for shallow draught boats, could \nbe repaired and/or extended to enable the jetty to be returned to use, or to allow larger vessels \nto lie alongside. \n23.  Warehousing. Concentration of cargo to a single point, where a dock, jetty and/or boat \nchannel is provided, allows copra and other produce to be accumulated prior to ship arrival, \nrather than putting ashore for small quantities at many locations which is costly on ship time. \nThis requires warehouse storage, which can also be used for essential goods, and can house ", "  Appendix 4  31 \nother community facilities, such as communications equipment and workrooms. A supportive \nsystem for ownership, management, and upkeep of each warehouse is also required. \n24.  Tracks.  Unpaved  roadways  are  useful  in  some  locations  to  enable  small  pickup \nmovement of passengers, produce, and other goods to the centralization point. In most cases, \nsome form of track already exists and all that is needed is some clearing and building up of the \nrunning surface with naturally occurring coral from sources on land. \n25.  Airstrip Extensions. The Project includes a small number of airstrip extensions where \naircraft currently have to operate at reduced payload, where there is traffic and development \npotential, and where the extensions can be made at modest cost and without adverse social or \nenvironmental effects. \n \n2.  Private Sector Participation in Domestic Shipping \n26.  Experience in the past has been that government-provided shipping has imposed a high \ncost  on  the  MOTC  budget,  for  several  reasons:  (i) higher  wage  rates  for  public  sector \nemployees  and  little  incentive  for  improved  labor  productivity,  (ii) ships  of  a  size  and \nconfiguration that are not well suited to the service and that are expensive to run, (iii) diversion \nof ships from their service schedule by government direction, and (iv) difficulty in mobilizing \ncash for payment of operating expenses or for periodic maintenance. \n27.  The thrust of advice from ADB technical assistance over a 6-year period has been that \nthe Government should exit from shipping operations altogether and, where necessary, provide \nfor noncommercial services to the outer islands through a competitively bid private sector \nfranchise scheme. Practical experience with such a system has shown that it does work in \npractice but that the tender conditions may be in need of refinement and there may be a \nshortage of interested private sector bidders, although this may be more due to the private \nsector\u2019s distrust that government will not unfairly compete than a true absence of interest. \n \n3.  Institutional Strengthening within MOTC \n28.  MOTC is in the process of reorganizing its internal structure and capacity for shipping \nservice operational management. It has established the shipping operation as an individual unit \nwithin the Ministry with all functions carried out internally. It has been agreed with MOTC that \nthe possibilities for efficiently outsourcing shipping operational functions such as the booking \nsystem and financial accounting should be reviewed, prior to loan approval. \n29.  Systems for recording ship movements, cargo and passenger volumes, and associated \npayments  are  still  under  development.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  has \nrecommended the form of operational data collection and monitoring that is required, both for \nmanagement information and for benefit monitoring and evaluation, and the required systems \nwill be progressively developed to a tested operational condition before loan approval. \n \n4.  Cost-Recovery Principles and Mechanisms \n30.  ADB has discussed, with the Government, the establishment of a trust account from \nwhich, as a minimum objective, the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the maritime \nand associated onshore infrastructure would be met. A more desirable objective would be full \nrecovery of capital and O&M costs over the economic lifetime of the assets. The trust account ", "32  Appendix 4 \nwould receive revenue from transport user levies, supplemented if necessary from government \nfunds. \n31.  It is anticipated that the account would be held by the Ministry of Finance, and the \nrevenue collected by an agent, such as the Bank of Marshall Islands or MIPA, with funds \ndisbursement  authorized  against  a  program  of  maintenance  needs  and  tendered  rates \nsubmitted by the responsible government agency. Ownership of the maritime assets would be \nvested in a government agency, such as MIPA, which would be responsible for drawing up an \nannual maintenance program. Ownership of the copra warehouses could be vested in MOTC, \nwhich would assume similar responsibilities. ", "  Appendix 5  33 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Asian Development Bank Country Lending and Technical Assistance \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided 11 loans totaling $71.125 million to \nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) since it joined ADB in April 1990. Of these, seven are \ncomplete, and the remaining loans are under implementation; Ebeye Health and Infrastructure \nis due for completion in 2002. Technical assistance (TA) grants totaling $19.585 million for 40 \nTAs have been provided as of December 2001. ADB has provided two sectorwide advisory \ntechnical assistance projects to the transport sector, the Transport Infrastructure Development \nProject (TIDP) and Institutional Strengthening of the Transport Sector (ISTS). \n \nTable A5: List of Asian Development Bank Loans to the Republic of the Marshall Islands \n \nLoan  Date of Board  Loan Amount \nNumber  Project Name  Approval  ($ million) \n       \n1102  Fisheries Development  26 Sep 1991  6.950 \n1218  Emergency Typhoon Rehabilitation Assistance Program  28 Jan 1993  0.500 \n1249  Basic Education Development  9 Sep 1993  8.000 \n1250  Majuro Water Supply  9 Sep 1993  0.700 \n1316  Health and Population  22 Sep 1994  5.700 \n1389  Majuro Water Supply and Sanitation  29 Sep 1995  9.200 \n1513  Public Sector Reform Program  30 Jan 1997  12.000 \n1694  Ebeye Health and Infrastructure  12 Aug 1999  9.250 \n1791  Skills Training and Vocational Education Project  29 Nov 2000  6.825 \n1828  Fiscal and Financial Management Program  7 Jun 2001  4.000 \n1829  Fiscal and Financial Management Program  7 Jun 2001  8.000 \n  Total    71.125 \n Source: Loan, TA, and Equity Approvals Database, ADB. \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Transport Sector Lending and Technical Assistance \n \n  1.  Transport Infrastructure Development Project \n \n2.  The TIDP1 TA proposed a 10-year infrastructure development program for road, sea, \nand air transport, together with proposals for policy and institutional change in the sector. The \ninfrastructure investment projects were focused on the main ports of Majuro and Ebeye and the \ninternational airport at Majuro, and were aimed at rehabilitation, repairs, and limited upgrading. \nA small program of investment in outer islands infrastructure was also recommended. The \nproposed loan project did not proceed due to the fiscal crisis experienced by the RMI in \n1996/97, to which the ADB responded by forming a policy advisory team and a public sector \nreform program loan.2 \n \n3.  The policy and institutional review under the TIDP recommended the establishment in \npractice of the Marshall Islands Port Authority (MIPA), a new Marshall Islands Airport Authority \n(MIAA), each of which was to be a self-financing, government-owned, commercial enterprise. A \ndedicated road maintenance fund was also recommended. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1994.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands for the Public Sector Reform Program. Manila. ", "34  Appendix 5 \n4.  The TA recommended that the Government introduce a shipping franchise system, \nwhereby private sector operators would tender for fixed-term service contracts in return for \npayment from Government, with the bidder requiring the lowest payment being awarded the \ncontract. This was proposed as a method of reducing the cost burden of the domestic shipping \nservice on the public sector budget, while at the same time opening up new opportunities for the \nprivate sector to engage in the domestic shipping market. \n \n  2.  Institutional Strengthening of the Transport Sector \n \n5.   The ISTS provided TA for the establishment of MIPA, the legal basis for which was \nalready in existence but had not been implemented. Assistance was given in establishing a \nconstitution and board of directors, drafting a corporate plan, transferring assets and liabilities \nfrom MOTC, and developing port management systems and a staff training program. Formation \nof MIPA removed the commercial functions of port ownership and operation from the policy and \nplanning  role  of  MOTC.  MIPA  was  expected  to  finance  its  operations  from  user  charges, \nremoving this cost from the public sector. \n \n6.   Establishment of MIAA was on similar principles but required new legislation, which was \nduly enacted. MIAA was encouraged to be self-funding, although this was likely to be more \ndifficult than for MIPA, in view of the heavy asset reinvestment program required in future years. \nThe third element of the TA was a road trust fund to collect road user revenues and apply these \nto road maintenance and traffic enforcement, again with the objective of removing costs from \nthe public budget. All three of these project components were successfully completed. \n \n7.   An extension to the ISTS provided assistance to MOTC in setting up the shipping \nfranchise scheme in 1998, with tenders invited within the RMI. Two bids were received, one \nbidder providing its own vessel and the second bidder offering to use one of the government \nvessels. The second offer was not taken up as the government vessel became unserviceable at \nthe time. A mixed system of the private sector franchise operator on one service route and the \ngovernment shipping service on other routes has operated since 1999. \n \nC.  Other External Assistance to the Transport Sector \n \n8.   The RMI has received recent external assistance from Japan and Taipei,China for road \nand  airport  development.  Repaving  of  Majuro  main  road  was  funded  under  Japan  grant \nassistance, while Taipei,China funded the paving of Majuro secondary urban roads, completed \nin 2001. Taipei,China has also provided grant assistance to the Marshall Islands Development \nBank  used in part to purchase three new interisland ships, two passenger/cargo vessels, and a \nsmall  fuel  tanker.  Taipei,China  has  also  provided  grants  of  $100,000  to  each  island  local \ngovernment  council  which,  in  some  cases,  has  also  been  used  for  vessel  purchase. \nTaipei,China is also expected to be a source of grant funding for airport extensions and paving \nat the subdistrict centers of Jaluit and Wotje. Finally, a United States Department of Agriculture \ncommunity facilities grant has funded the purchase of small pickup trucks for the outer islands \nand two school buses for Majuro and Ebeye, at $140,000 in FY2001. \n ", "  Appendix 6  35 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \n1.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $10.0 million  equivalent.

Introduction \n \n1.  During the 2002 Asian Development Bank (ADB) country programming mission to the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), the Government, through the Minister of Transportation \nand Communications (MOTC), requested technical assistance (TA) to improve the operational \nand  commercial  systems  of  MOTC  and  Air  Marshall  Islands  (AMI) to  enable  improved \neffectiveness and efficiency of outer island for sea and air transport services delivery. \n \n2.  In a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Government and ADB signed in \nMajuro on 23 April 2002, the Minister concurred with the content, financing, and timing of the \nTA. A concept paper for the TA was attached to the MOU. \n \n3.  The TA is included in the project framework in Appendix 1. The proposed assistance is \nincluded in the 2003\u20132004 pipeline and would be implemented in parallel with the Outer Island \nTransport Infrastructure Project. \n \nB.  Issues \n \n4.  The RMI's many small and widely dispersed outer island communities are served by \nsubsidized shipping services operated partly by the Government and partly under private sector \ncontracts. AMI, which is government owned, operates small aircraft to outer island airstrips. \nThese remote communities have limited resources and experience poverty of opportunity and \nrelative  income  poverty  from  their  isolation.  The  transport  services  are  critically  important \nlifelines but impose a large burden on public finances, which the Government is willing to \nsupport, but which needs to be contained. \n \n5.  In 1999, following advice and assistance from ADB, the Government issued tenders for \nprivate  sector  operation  of  shipping  services  under  a  subsidized  competitive  franchise \narrangement. One contract was entered into with a private operator who supplied his own \nvessel, while a second contract was not taken up due to unavailability of the government vessel \nthat was to have been made available under lease. Subsequently, the RMI was gifted three \nvessels by Taipei,China, which it has operated in parallel with the private sector contracts. \n \n6.  While  greatly  improved  from  before  1999,  there  are  problems  with  the  current \narrangement, both with aspects of the private operator\u2019s contract conditions and performance, \nand with the Government's own shipping operations. On the private sector side these include \noverly high prices for goods sold from the ship at outer islands, the standard of passenger \nfacilities,  and  the  maximum  freight  rates  charged,  which  are  viewed  as  too  high.  On  the \nGovernment's side there are concerns about the cost of the service stemming partly from a fleet \nthat is probably too large, slow turnaround and slack time in port, insecure provision for ship \nmaintenance, and no long-term fleet planning. The Government also needs to develop its \nshipping, commercial, operating, and management information systems to efficiently perform its \nown functions and to monitor the private sector contracts. \n \n7.  AMI is a small, undercapitalized, government-owned airline, and provides the only air \nservices  to  the  outer  islands  using  two  aging  Dornier  228  turboprop  aircraft,  which  have \nexperienced considerable downtime and which are due for major overhaul. The air links to the \nouter islands are important lifelines for government administration, and for social and economic ", "40  Appendix 8 \ndevelopment. The airline faces strategic decisions on its future fleet and operational planning, \nand its business systems and management need to be streamlined. \n \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n \n  1.  Purpose and Output \n \n    a.  Purpose \n \n8.  The Project will complement the accompanying loan, the purpose of which is to improve \nthe efficiency and reliability of outer island transport through selected physical infrastructure \nimprovements\u2014navigation aids, wharves and jetties, warehouses, track improvements, and \nairstrip extensions. \n \n9.  The Project will assist the Government in the financial and operational management of \ninterisland shipping and air transport, including private sector participation, to achieve more \nfinancially sustainable and cost-effective services at lower levels of subsidy, releasing funds for \nother social and economic programs. It will assist the loan project achieve its economic rate of \nreturn objectives by encouraging better fleet configuration and utilization and in taking maximum \nadvantage of the efficiency gains provided by the infrastructure improvements. \n \n    b.  Expected Results \n \n10.  Government shipping service and private sector shipping contracts: \n \n(i)  further development of the management information systems needed to enable \nthe  MOTC  shipping  operation  to  function  as  an  efficient  government-owned \nenterprise; \n(ii)  implementation of systems for operational monitoring of shipping contracts and \nMOTC's shipping operation; and \n(iii)  improved long-term fleet management. \n11.  AMI: \n \n(i)  an assessment of the market position and strategic outlook for the airline; and \n(ii)  review and improvement of the airline's operational management, and financial \naccounting and commercial systems. \n    c.  Deliverables \n \n12.  These include: \n \n(i)  reports on project performance and baseline report on benefit monitoring for the \nOuter Island Transport Infrastructure Project; \n(ii)  annual statements of intent and statements of service performance for the MOTC \nshipping operation, and improved annual reports for AMI; \n(iii)  new and improved business and information systems for the MOTC shipping \noperation and AMI; \n(iv)  long-term plan for utilization, maintenance, disposal, and replacement of the \ngovernment shipping fleet; and \n(v)  a strategic plan for the future direction of AMI. ", "  Appendix 8  41 \n  2.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  A budget of $250,000 is proposed from ADB resources. The financing plan for the TA is \nshown in Table A8. \n \n  3.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  MOTC will be the executing agency for the shipping component of the TA and AMI for \nthe aviation component. The secretary, MOTC and the board of AMI will each appoint a project \nmanager for their respective components of the technical assistance. \n \n15.  It is estimated that around 15 person-months consulting (7 person-months international \nand 8 person-months domestic) will be required. The consultants will be selected through the \nquality and cost-based selection method and the simplified TA submission in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and by other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n \n16.  International consultant inputs will be required intermittently over an 18-month period in \nthe areas of (i) shipping commercial operations, ship maintenance/survey, and management \ninformation  systems;  and  (ii) aviation  commercial  operations,  aircraft  engineering,  and \nmanagement information systems. Domestic consultants will be recruited to support the Project \nin  the  areas  of  accounting,  management  information  systems  and  information  technology. \nTerms of reference for consultant inputs are in Appendix 12. The consultants are expected to \nbegin work on the Project within 30 working days of the signing of the contract. \n \n17.  TA outputs will be directly applied in business activities of MOTC and AMI. Reports will \nbe available as examples for similar conditions elsewhere in the region. \n \nTable A8: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($'000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

", "42  Appendix 9  \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Target Groups and Beneficiaries \n \n1.  The project area consists of 19 islands, 16 of which are atolls with lagoons and three \n(Jabat, Mejit, and Lib) are single reef islands. There are six other inhabited islands not included \nin the project area as these are either in receipt of special compensation funds (Kili, Bikini, \nRongelap, and Enewetok) or are the major urban centers (Majuro and Kwajalein). The islands in \nthe project area itself have also been analyzed in relation to their proximity to Majuro since this \nprovides a focal point for transport and markets. The six closest islands are Arno, Mili, Jaluit, \nAur, Jabat, and Ailinglaplap; these are referred to as the \u201ccloser islands.\u201d The remaining 13 \nislands in the project area are the \u201cdistant islands.\u201d \n \n2.  The primary target group is the population of the 19 outer islands of the project area. \nThese account for 30% of the total population. The people of the outer islands have the lowest \nincomes in the country (two thirds of the population in the project area, the beneficiaries, have \nan  income  level  below  $1  per  day)  and  least  access  to  basic  services  and  economic \nopportunities. Nearly all households on these islands are semi-subsistence and low income, and \nare considered poor. The few households not considered poor are those with a wage-earning \nmember,  almost  all  of  whom  are  government  employees.  Improvements  to  the  transport \ninfrastructure, and thus to transport services, will benefit the poor outer island people directly. \nThe improvements will also bring indirect benefits to all the people in the country, as transport \nservices cover all islands and general efficiency gains will be enjoyed by all transport users. \nFurthermore, improved transport will bring benefits to all the people of the country by increasing \nbudget  resources,  through  lower  transport  costs  and  subsidies  as  well  as  allowing \nimprovements  to  service  delivery,  which  could  be  used  to  further  poverty  reduction  and \ndevelopment programs. \n \n3.  The target group comprises all relatively poor households, all of whom are current and \npotential  users  of  transport  services,  and  are  reliant  on  essential,  pro-poor  social  and \ndevelopment services provided by others who are the direct users of transport services, and \nhouseholds and businesses that could benefit or be adversely impacted by changes in access \nto, from, and around the outer islands. Subgroups among the target population are: \n \n(i)  social and community services and private households in respect of building \nmaterials, fuel, and other supplies; \n(ii)  the population of the outer islands as consumers of imported staple foods such \nas rice, flour, and sugar; \n(iii)  passengers to, from, and between the outer islands, including school children; \nand \n(iv)  consignees of fish, island produce, and handicrafts for sale in Majuro and Ebeye; \nand copra growers and traders. \n \nB.  Poverty Status of the Outer Islands \n \n4.  Health. All outer islands have a dispensary (health clinic); on the atolls, this is usually \nlocated at the main center of the atoll group. Although it was noted during the consultation visits \nthat some dispensaries have not been completed (Jabat, Buoj on Ailinglaplap, and Bikirij on \nArno). There are 54 health centers spread through the islands of the project area, each staffed \nwith a health assistant. At present, none of these centers has cold chain facilities, although a \nUnited Nations project is about to provide solar power for lighting, refrigeration, water pump, and ", "  Appendix 9  43 \nradio to 11 of the centers. The health assistant provides only basic health care services and \nnone  of  the  centers  is  equipped  to  handle  surgery  or  inpatient  treatment.  The  lack  of \nrefrigeration and problems with shipping and transport generally often mean that clinics run out \nof pharmacy medicine and even basic treatment is unavailable or unsatisfactory. At present, \nwith the difficulties in transport, only the most serious cases are taken to Majuro or Ebeye for \nemergency treatment; consequently treatment is often too late causing additional suffering and, \nsometimes, unnecessary deaths to outer island patients. \n \n5.  Relative poverty is indicated by the fact that less than 1% of the households in the \nproject area have piped water compared to a quarter of those in other parts of the country. In \nthe project area, wells or rain catchments are the principal sources of water, and these are both \nsusceptible to contamination. In respect of sanitation facilities, 58% of households in the project \narea either have no toilet facilities or use pit latrines. This compares to only 18% in the rest of \nthe country. The poor sanitation and lack of guaranteed safe water are a primary cause of the \nhigh level of diarrheal diseases reported in the outer islands. Diabetes, measles, hypertension \nand, most recently, tuberculosis are among the other most prevalent diseases reported in the \nproject area. \n \n6.  Infrequent and unreliable transport means that even when medical teams go to the outer \nislands they are often unable to undertake all the treatment required in the time available \nbetween island stops and individual voyages. The Ministry of Health is hoping to overcome \nsome of these problems by supporting a proposal for a medical mission-sponsored mobile \n\u201chospital ship\u201d which will tour the outer islands providing regular medical and surgical services \nand specialist dental and eye care. The operation and safety of this vessel, which is expected to \nbe  staffed  by  volunteers  and  funded  by  US  charities,  will  be  greatly  facilitated  by  the \nimprovements to island transport infrastructure under the Project. \n \n7.  Education. All outer islands have primary/elementary schools. Only three of the outer \nislands  have  secondary  schools\u2014Ailinglaplap  (private),  Jaluit  (public),  and  Wotje  (public). \nSecondary education is organized on a regional basis, with students traveling to and from the \nhigh schools where they board for the school year. This sets up a peak in the demand for sea \ntransport between the home island and the islands with high schools. Irregular and unreliable \nshipping therefore causes inconvenience and family disruption when children are stranded at \nholiday times. \n \n8.  The literacy rate for the outer islands as a group was reported as 95% in the 1999 \ncensus compared with 97% in the RMI. Ailuk and Lib have much lower literacy rates with 85% \nand 89%, respectively. Aur, Lae, Likiep, and Mejit on the other hand recorded the highest \nliteracy rates at 99%, a higher rate than that for the RMI as a whole. \n \n9.  Three percent of the outer island population have not received any education. Mejit and \nUtirik have twice this rate with 6% of their populations not completing education at any level. \nAbout  a  quarter  of  the  population  had  attained  a  Grade  8  education,  the  equivalent  of \ncompletion of primary or elementary school. This figure is higher in Lib and Moloelap, with a \nthird of the population of each island attaining education to Grade 8 level. \n \n10.  Fifteen percent of the population completed Grades 9 through 11 (secondary or high \nschool) with a range across the outer islands from 9% (Jabat and Lae) to 17\u201319% (Ailinglaplap, \nEbon, Jaluit, and Wotje). The higher figures recorded in Jaluit and Wotje are unsurprising \nconsidering the location of public high schools at these two subregional centers. Mejit is the only \nisland in the project area that records more than 10% graduating from high school (Grade 12). ", "44  Appendix 9  \nFor all other of the outer islands between 3% (Ailuk and Namdrik) and 8% (Ebon, Jabat, and \nJaluit) had graduated from Grade 12. Ujae was the only island that did not record anyone \ngraduating from high school. Less than 1% of the population had attained a tertiary degree or \nqualification. \n \n11.  Household Facilities. There is a general pattern of relative poverty or disadvantage for \nhouseholds in the islands of the project area in relation both to those in the nonproject islands \nand the overall national averages. Within the project area itself there is also a pattern of relative \ndisadvantage between the six islands closest to Majuro (Arno, Ailinglaplap, Aur, Mili, Jabat, and \nJaluit) and the 13 more distant islands. This is primarily a reflection of their proximity to Majuro \nand the more frequent transport services provided by small private vessels. \n \n12.  Less than 1% of households in the project area own any form of motorized vehicle \nalthough  handcarts  are  more  common.  Not  surprisingly,  ownership  of  canoes  is  more \nwidespread with 28.7% of households reporting ownership. This compares with a national \naverage of 16.3% ownership. Within the project area, 30% of the households in the \u201cclose six\u201d \nowned canoes compared to 27.5% of those in the \u201cdistant 13.\u201d While none of the households on \nLib and only 10.2% of those on Wotje reported canoe ownership, some 59% of households on \nLae had canoes. \n \n13.  With 41% of households in the project area not owning a radio, compared to 28% \nnationally, considerable importance is attached to the visits of the Ministry of Internal Affairs \nmobile teams and their awareness and public education programs. In the distant islands, almost \n45% of households are without radios compared to 37% of those closer to Majuro. Lib, followed \nby Ailuk, are the most disadvantaged islands with 86.7% and 70.5% of households respectively \nnot having a radio. In contrast on Namdrik only 20.3% are without radios. \n \n14.  Water and Sanitation. Water and sanitation facilities are also areas of poverty and \ndisadvantage  for  the  outer  islands  and  this  is  reflected  in  the  high  incidence  of  diarrheal \ndiseases. In the project area, 58% of households are without proper toilet facilities. In Lib, no \nhousehold has a proper toilet, however only 13% are without such facilities on Jabat. Only a few \nhouseholds on Jaluit, representing less than 0.5% of all households in the project area, have \npiped water compared to a national average of 14.3%. Well water is used by 9% of households \nin the project area. In the distant islands the proportion is 14.2% compared to only 4.1% in the \nclose islands and to a national average of 3.4%. Household rainwater catchment is the primary \nsource of drinking water for households in the project area. On Wotho, Lib, and Jabat all \nhouseholds rely on rainwater as do more than 90% of the households on eight other project \narea islands. Well water supplies are fragile sources and are easily contaminated, while reliance \non rainfall becomes a problem in many of the outer islands during periods of drought. \n \n15.  The household characteristics described indicate the relative disadvantages and poverty \nexperienced by households in the project area. Ownership of household assets, access to safe \nwater and proper toilet facilities, and the availability and use of electricity for cooking and lighting \nare all much worse in the project area than in the country as a whole. This suggests that living \nconditions are generally poor and that the lack of incomes constrains families from acquiring \nhousehold assets and improving their living conditions. The data also suggest that households \nin the islands most distant from Majuro experience the greatest level of poverty in the country. \nThe most distant islands will be the islands to benefit most from the Project since they are the \nones that have the least regular and least reliable transport services at present. \n ", "  Appendix 9  45 \nC.  Project's Impact on Poverty \n \n16.  The  impact  of  the  project  on  outer  island  communities  will  be  primarily  through \nimprovements to the regularity and reliability of ship visits to each island which will have the \nfollowing poverty reduction benefits to the outer island communities: \n \n(i)  improved supply and availability of goods from the on-board merchants at more \ncompetitive prices with less opportunities for island stores to over-charge for \ngoods between irregular ships calls\u2014this will assist the majority of households in \nthe targeted islands who are poor to get better value for their low incomes; \n(ii)  improved availability of services from government agencies, including health and \neducation, Ministry of Internal Affairs and other departments and agencies that \ntravel on field trips\u2014this will help reduce problems of access to basic services, \ninformation, supplies of school books and materials and supplies for island clinics \nand will assist in the implementation of other outer island projects through better \ntransport of labor, materials and equipment; \n(iii)  improved shipping for export of produce from the islands to the markets in Majuro \nand Ebeye\u2014this will enable poor outer island families to increase their incomes; \nit  is  estimated  that  incomes  could  increase  by  20%  from  increased  copra \nproduction alone (again, the majority of poor households depend on minimal \ncash incomes from the production of copra); \n(iv)  improved commercial systems for shipping, including recording of cargoes and \ngoods liability regimes and less loss or damage to perishable and other cargoes \nfrom poor handling facilities at island wharves\u2014this will help address problems \nwith  security  of  cargoes  and  late  payment  and  will  thus  assist  the  poor  to \nmaximize the returns from their production; it will also assist in creating a better \nenvironment in which private enterprises can be established; \n(v)  improved safety on board ships from the better navigation aids (navaids) and \npassenger  facilities  at  the  embarkation/disembarkation  points  at  the  island \nwharves, especially for children and the elderly (fatal accidents have occurred at \nsome difficult locations in the past); \n(vi)  runway  extensions  and  improved  runway  maintenance  will,  for  the  poor, \ndisadvantaged outer island families, (a) provide safer, more regular and reliable \nflights to the main centers; (b) allow higher payloads and increase space for high \nvalue  and  perishable  goods;  (c)  provide  improved  emergency  evacuation \nservices  as  required;  and  for  Air  Marshall  Islands  (AMI),  they  will  enable \noperation and maintenance costs to be contained. \n16.  For the whole population of the RMI the benefits of the project will include: \n \n(i)  reduced costs and greater efficiency in providing services to the outer islands, \nespecially in relation to the field trips and the supply of staff, materials and \nequipment to health clinics, schools, and island projects; \n(ii)  reduced budget costs for outer island shipping and air services and in subsidies \nto copra producers; these savings will make available more resources for priority \nsectors, including health and education, which will help further reduce the poverty \nof opportunity of the people in the project area; \n(iii)  less, or at least a slowing in the rate of migration from the outer islands to the \nurban areas and a consequent minimizing of the likely costs of additional urban \ninfrastructure and services. ", "46  Appendix 9  \n17.  The impact on government and NGO services will be to relieve the costs, staff time, and \nuncertainty associated with trying to deliver essential, pro-poor, public services to the outer \nislands. This will allow saved time and money to be put to productive use and raise the reliability \nand productivity of social programs. Problems currently experienced are: \n \n(i)  The Ministry of Internal Affairs\u2014staff cannot visit regularly due to the irregular \nshipping service; lengths of stay are indeterminate and staff time is wasted; \nhence trips are made less frequently than they should. The Ministry of Internal \nAffair's mobile community development team tries to visit 7 islands a year in \nresponse to requests from local governments but cannot achieve its targets; \nexpensive special charters or air travel can be required. \n(ii)  The Women's Development Office (WDO) works closely with two NGO groups, \nWomen United Together in Marshall Islands (WUTMI) and the Marshall Islands \nHandicraft  Association  (MIHA)  in  the  support  of  women's  development, \nparticularly in the development of the handicraft industry. Lack of transport is a \nmajor impediment to marketing. \n(iii)  The Ministry of Education (MoE) requires regular contact with the outer islands in \norder to complete annual monitoring and training programs; the cost of flights \nprecludes regular monitoring and the field trip schedule is not frequent enough to \nbe used for this purpose. Irregularity of the field trip vessel and security of \nsupplies on board are significant problems. The schedule, even when adhered \nto, is not synchronized with the school terms and often teachers, students, and \nmaterials arrive after the school year has commenced. MoE avoids the theft of \neducational  materials  by  sending  staff  members  along  with  the  materials  to \nensure their safe arrival at the outer island schools. This takes staff away from \ntheir regular duties for several weeks. Transport of secondary school students is \na difficult exercise and often MoE needs to recruit other vessels such as PWD's \nYFUs to assist. MoE also needs to transport food to the secondary boarding \nschools on a regular basis. Often schools run out and MoE has to charter a \nvessel to transport additional or top-up food supplies. A more regular field trip \nschedule would be beneficial as MoE could send food supplies on a regular basis \nand secondly would not have the large up-front costs of providing food for 3 or 4 \nmonths at a time. \n(iv)  Proposed Women's & Youth Training Center\u2014ADB has funded the development \nof  a  Women's  &  Youth  Skills  Training  Center  based  in  Majuro.  The  project \nfocuses on upgrading existing skills training into a comprehensive and integrated \ntraining system. The target beneficiaries of the project are the women and youth \nof the outer islands and will seek to provide skills training that will improve \nincome-generating capabilities. Initially the project will train 800 women, 600 \nyouths, and 150 people who have dropped out of high school. For women to be \nable to fully utilize the opportunities provided by the Center, affordable, regular, \nand reliable transport services between the outer islands and Majuro will be \nessential. First, women cannot be away from their homes and families for too \nlong and this requires a service that can bring women from the outer islands to \nMajuro and return within about a week. Second, women will require regular \nsupport visits from Center, WUTMI, and WDO staff when first establishing small \nbusinesses. \n(v)  Health Services Delivery\u2014the Department of Health (DoH) is an office within the \nMinistry of Health & Environment (MoH&E), which operates two hospitals, one in \nMajuro and the other in Ebeye, as well as 60 health clinics/dispensaries in the \nouter islands. The dispensaries are only capable of handling basic health care as ", "  Appendix 9  47 \nthey often do not have electricity and are only equipped with rudimentary plant. \nDoH also provides a traveling clinic, which services the more remote islands. In \nemergencies the outer island dispensary will arrange a medi-vac\u2014by either an \nAMI flight or chartered boat depending on the seriousness of the condition\u2014and \nthis is charged to the MoH&E budget. For regular transport of medical supplies \nDoH will reserve space on scheduled flights and use shipping services for the \ntransport of larger items. It should be noted that the shipment of larger items is \nonly required for the construction (or refit) of dispensaries and thus DoH is not a \nregular user of the field trip service. \n(vi)  WUTMI is an NGO, first established in 1987, but has only been able to meet and \norganize  on  an  irregular  basis  due  to  lack  of  funding  and  difficulties  with \ncommunication between Majuro and the outer islands. Under the umbrella of \nWDO, WUTMI and its local chapters look after family, church, community groups, \nhealth  awareness,  sports  activities,  microcredit  schemes  and  women's \ndevelopment projects in the outer islands. The constitution of WUTMI requires \nmeetings  every  2  years  to  undertake  general  business  and  to  elect  new \nexecutive board members. The meetings have not occurred every 2 years due to \ndifficulties with getting all women involved to one place on time; some women \nhave  to  fly  to  reduce  the  amount  of  time  involved  and  this  becomes  very \nexpensive  and  ultimately  impractical  for  WUTMI  under  its  current  funding \narrangements. WUTMI organizes the transport of handicraft and other goods \n(salted clams, preserved breadfruit, and banana bread) from the outer islands to \neither Majuro or Ebeye. AMI often does not have enough room for the goods; \nsome goods get left behind and other goods have to in effect purchase a seat on \nthe aircraft in order to get them to the main centers. WUTMI has also had its \nfreight  bumped  off  the  scheduled  flights  if  the  flights  are  too  full  and  has \nexperienced goods going missing. The field trip schedule is neither regular nor \nreliable enough for WUTMI to use this method of handicraft transportation. \nD.  Social Impacts of Construction \n \n18.  All outer island construction projects will employ local labor, which will be derived from \npoor households. \n \n19.  Many of the subprojects involve improvements, extensions, or rehabilitation to existing \ninfrastructure and do not require the clearance or occupation of new land or water area. There \nare projects that involve new dock/jetty sites, new warehouses, and clearance of tracks and \nrunway extensions. In no case is resettlement of population expected to be required. Clearance \nof vegetation will in some cases involve removal or trimming of trees although only on a very \nsmall scale. \n \n20.  During consultations between and among the Government, local communities, and ADB \nconsultants, the social effects of the projects were discussed with the local communities on site. \nIn many cases the subprojects being proposed had been identified and discussed in the past. It \nwas clear that the communities placed a much higher value on securing the new infrastructure \nand more reliable transport services than the possible short-term inconveniences and use of \nland and coastal zone for the new infrastructure. None of the sites for new buildings was \nconsidered  to  be  a  problem,  although  this  does  not  preclude  the  later  possibility  of \ncompensation. \n ", "48  Appendix 9  \n21.  Impacts from increased transport activity are very low, as ship calls are only at 6- to 8-\nweek intervals and aircraft normally only once per week. Arrivals are more a cause of interest \nthan an imposition. In all cases, the locations of boat landing points and airstrip runways are \nunchanged. On none of the atolls and islands visited was the increase in noise and traffic \n(mostly pedestrian, push carts, and a few vehicles) considered to be a significant effect. Instead \nan increase in social and economic activity at a centralized point (dock and warehouse) was \nwelcomed by the Government and local communities. \n \nE.  Poverty Reduction Strategy \n \n  1.  Government Strategy for the Outer Islands \n \n22.  Meto  2000  and  the  subsequent  Second  National  Economic  and  Social  Summit \n(NESS II) held in 2001 set direction and strategy for the next 15 years. Elements of the strategy \nthat impact on poverty reduction in the outer islands and provide the setting for this Project are: \n \n  (i)  Goal  2:  Renewed  Economic  Growth,  Strategy  2,  Improve  Infrastructure: \nensure regular and reliable outer island shipping and air services, solar or diesel \npower, potable water and telecommunications all at regionally competitive costs \nto  users  (including  where  necessary  transparent  and  monitored  subsidy  to \nnoncommercial services); and \n  (ii)  Goal 3: Equitable Distribution, Eliminate Deprivation and Poverty in RMI, \nStrategy 3, Outer Island Development Program: maintain reliable shipping \nservices through monitored contracts with private operators, bring under review \nthe per-head distribution of, and access to, land, marine resources, economic \nand  social  services  and  infrastructure  in  the  atolls  other  than  Majuro  and \nKwajalein, identify areas of significantly below-average access and inventory, \nand develop a practical program for progressively reducing the deficiencies as \nrevenue and aid resources permit. \n \n23.  Other general goals that have a bearing are promotion of private enterprise, facilitating \nland leasing, provision of development credit, and strengthening privatization and outsourcing. \n \n  2.  Outer Island Development Priorities \n \n24.  During project feasibility consultation, the local government and community members \nwere asked to discuss issues related to island development generally and to the development \npriorities of their islands in particular. Improved access and transport ranked as a high priority \nfor  all  of  the  22  islands  visited.  In  the  most  general  terms  development  of  infrastructure \n(transport and energy supply/electricity) and assistance and support for agriculture and farming \nwere seen as critical to the socioeconomic development of the outer islands. \n \n25.  Local  government  members,  acting  mayors,  and  the  communities  interviewed  also \nconsidered that improving transport links and access is a spearhead for economic growth and \ndevelopment.  This  is  demonstrated  in  the  following  comments  that  consider  transport \nimprovements could create a range of benefits including: \n \n(i)  improved access to the urban markets and key social services as well as cultural \nand economic exchange will be more convenient; \n(ii)  travel able can be planned according to a regular and reliable trip schedule, and \ntravel time reduced; and ", "  Appendix 9  49 \n(iii)  fish and agricultural products can be sold more regularly to Majuro and Ebeye. \n \n  3.  Bilateral and Multilateral Aid Programs \n \n26.  Assistance from bilateral and multilateral agencies is targeted at the outer islands in \nother development sectors, as described in Appendix 5. \n \n  4.  Project Positioning \n \n27.  The Project has a high degree of support within the Government and from the outer \nisland communities, and is fully consistent with the national development goals and strategies \nestablished by Meto 2000 and NESS II 2001. \n \n28.  For  the  effects  of  the  project  on  poverty  reduction  to  be  fully  realized,  both  the \ninfrastructure improvements and the complementary efficiencies in transport services will need \nto be mobilized together. This is the rationale for the actions to be taken during loan processing \nand in parallel with implementation. \n \n29.  The transport infrastructure project is related closely to other development strategies and \nprojects in the outer islands and, in particular, to the future of the production of local produce \nand to the development of other economic activities, including tourism. \n \n  5.  Complementary and Supporting Activities \n \n30.  It is clear that more than physical infrastructure alone will be required to assist the outer \nislands in their socioeconomic development. Overall, an integrated approach to development is \nrequired. Such an approach needs to be rooted in progressing investments in human and social \ndevelopment (including human resource development and outer island services enhancement) \nand physical infrastructure in tandem. The Project is in a good position to encourage investment \nin areas that also support outer island development and poverty reduction; in some cases, \nproject components could be advanced as part of a multisector island development project. \n \n31.  The types of integrated programs and complementary activities that could be targeted \nfor investment include: \n \n(i)  resource management projects, particularly aimed at diversifying and increasing \nagricultural productivity in the outer islands, community-based fisheries projects, \nand active participation in environmental protection; \n(ii)  paid  participation  in  transport  infrastructure,  maintenance,  and  development \nprojects,  such  as  regular  airstrip  clearing,  community  or  cooperative \nmanagement of warehouses, self-policing island based groups aimed at reducing \nvandalism to navigation aids, maintenance of tracks and roads, development of \npotable water sources, irrigation systems, and small island energy systems; \n(iii)  institutional  capacity  building  within  agencies  that  have  the  mandate  for \nresources development, outer islands development and poverty reduction; and \n(iv)  development  of  sustainable  microcredit  and  microfinancing  schemes,  outer \nisland enterprise development and community-based participatory planning. \n ", "50  Appendix 9  \nTable A9: Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \nA.

Shipping brings in essential goods and services and takes \nout island produce from which the poor earn a substantial portion of their incomes. Shipping also brings in \ngovernment services and supplies, particularly to the schools and health clinics. Shipping provides an essential \nservice to families in transporting children to and from secondary schools and colleges elsewhere in the Republic \nof the Marshall Islands (RMI), and in providing links for everyone to the urban centers and the outside world. Air \nservices provide passenger and freight transport, as well as emergency evacuation services for sick and vulnerable \npeople. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nAnalysis: \n \nThirty percent of the population lives in the 19 outer islands which makes up the project area. Communities in the \nouter islands suffer from physical isolation leading to low incomes, lack of basic services, and poverty of \nopportunity. The people who live in these outer islands have significantly lower incomes than the national average, \nand it is estimated that around two thirds of the population in the project area has an income level below the United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP) poverty line threshold of $1 a day. \n \nC.

Approach \n \n  1.  Project Costs \n \n1.  The  costs  included  in  the  economic  analysis  are  those  for  civil  works,  equipment, \nconsulting  services,  and  physical  contingencies.  The  financial  costs  were  converted  into \neconomic costs by eliminating price escalation and interest during construction as well as taxes \nand duties from the financial costs. All costs are mid-2001 prices. \n \n  2.  Project Benefits \n \n2.  Project benefits for marine components are derived primarily from savings in ship and \nboat operating costs, comprising fuel, crew costs, other direct operating expenses, and savings \nin fleet size. Other contributions to project benefits are (i) savings in ship and boat operating \ncosts, (ii) reduced cargo-handling and weather damage, (iii) reduced loss in cargo value from \nincreased service reliability, (iv) reductions in passenger travel time, and (v) reduced risk of \nvessel grounding and damage or loss. \n \n3.  Benefits for airstrip extensions and remedial maintenance arise from (i) user benefits of \nreopening closed airstrips (two of the projects); (ii) reduced damage to aircraft from loose \nmaterial on the runway; (iii) reduced risk to aircraft by improved obstruction clearances, longer \nand  better  surfaced  runway  with  markings,  and  wind  indicator;  and  (iv) increased  payload \ncapacity arising from runway improvement.1 \n \n  3.  Induced Travel Demand \n \n4.  Improved service frequency and reliability consequent on the reduced voyage times, and \ncorresponding freight and passenger cost reductions translating into lower tariffs, will have \ndemand-side effects. The response of copra growers to changes in the copra buying price \nindicates that higher prices do not necessarily lead to increased production, so lower freight \ncosts may similarly not always have that effect. However, responses from the consultations \nindicate that increased service frequency, to a maximum of between 8 and 12 ship calls per \nyear, would result in some increased copra production. In turn, the increased cash income can \nbe expected to lead to increased consumption of imported goods and, possibly, to a higher \npropensity for personal travel. \n \n5.  There are two methods that are generally used for calculating the benefits of induced \ntravel demand. The easiest to apply, provided the elasticity of demand with respect to transport \ncosts is known, is a transport user surplus approach, the benefits being assessed as the implied \nvalue of the additional travel, measured as the product of the increase in transport demand and \nthe reduction in travel cost multiplied by a half (the demand curve being assumed straight over \nthe marginal change). \n \n6.  A more complete approach and one that can be applied where there are a limited \nnumber of commodities being transported and where producer responses can be anticipated, is \nto measure the difference in producer surplus. In either case, an adjustment is required to the \n                                                 \n1  The expected financial return of this last benefit is relatively limited and difficult to quantify, thus, it is not \nconsidered in the analysis\u2019 conservative assumption. ", "52  Appendix 10 \nanalysis of induced demand to take account of differences between resource costs and market \nprices. This is particularly important in this case where passenger fares, freight rates, and copra \nprices are all heavily subsidized. \n \n7.  The net benefits attributable to induced transport demand can be either positive or \nnegative depending on various factors such as comparative supply and demand elasticities and \nthe amount of difference between market prices and resource costs. It is quite feasible, and may \nbe the case here, that the economic value of induced demand is negative. \n \n8.  In this case, a lagged model of copra volumes against the subsidized grower price \nshowed a weak but significant relationship, calibrated to a price elasticity of demand of 0.26. \nThere is also some evidence of a demand relationship against regularity of shipping services, \nbut insufficient data for calibration. \n \n9.  Overall, induced demand effects are estimated to yield an increase of 30% in both copra \nvolumes  and  import  cargo  demand,  which  have  been  treated  as  generated  traffic  in  the \neconomic appraisal. \n \n  4.  Interrelationship between Subprojects \n \n10.  The subprojects cannot each be evaluated in isolation as their effects are interactive. \nThe components of the Project are integrated and mutually complementary. Providing better \nnavigation aids and marks is not sufficient on its own since the benefits of easier access to \nlagoons provided by the navaids can only be realized in full if the vessels can then approach \ncloser  to  shore  through  cleared  passages  or  come  alongside  to  the  island  wharves. \nConsultations with ship operators and government indicate that night working is acceptable on \nthe islands and that the expected time savings will be realized. \n \nB.  Project Costs \n \n11.  Total economic cost of the selected project components is $9.54 million. Maintenance \ncosts have been estimated as a percentage of capital value per annum according to the \nfollowing assumptions: \n \n(i)  Docks and jetties\u20141% for deck furniture, fendering, etc. plus an allowance of 1% \nper year for periodic concrete repairs every 10 years. \n(ii)  Channels are assumed to fill in over a period of between 10 and 20 years. An \nannual maintenance allowance of 5% per annum is estimated from year 5. \n(iii)  Breakwaters are designed on a 5% damage criterion for the design storm. For a \n100-year design return period storm, and a 20-year design life, this gives a 20% \nencounter probability over the design life, giving 1% in any year from year 1; also \nallow 1% of capital value for topping up rocks from year 5, giving 2% per annum \noverall. \n(iv)  Warehouses\u2014allow 1% year 3, 2% year 4, and 4% per annum from year 5. \n(v)  Navaids\u2014no maintenance for the steel pile structure for 20 years, excluding \nmajor typhoon damage. Light fittings will cost about $1,000 to replace, including \nthe light itself. Allow replacement of 5% of light fittings in year 3, 10% in year 4, \nand 20% from year 5. \n(vi)  Transport equipment\u20145% of capital value in year 3, 10% in year 4, and 20% \nfrom year 5. \n ", "  Appendix 10  53 \nC.  Project Benefits \n \n12.  The Project will contribute both directly and indirectly to poverty reduction in the project \narea. The revised discounted cash-flow analysis indicates that a total of around one third of the \naverage annual benefits will accrue directly to the people of the outer islands through (i) better \nmarket  access  and  increased  incomes  from  local  produce  sales  (10%  of  total  benefits); \n(ii) passenger time savings, increased safety, and less cargo damage (25% of total benefits); \nand (iii) income earned from employment during project implementation. Less cargo damage \nwill also benefit merchants, the public, and ship operators. Reduced operating costs, comprising \naround half of the total benefits, will accrue directly to ship operators and to the Government \nthrough reduced operating subsidies. Outer island communities will benefit indirectly through \n(i) lower real fares and cargo charges; (ii) lower prices for store goods from on-board merchants \nresulting from increased competition; and (iii) less risk of stock loss and damage through poor \nhandling. \n \n13.  The largest source of benefits is ship time savings. The analysis shows that almost 20% \nof ship days could be saved, with a value of $0.4 million annually, provided that the opportunity \nis taken to do this (rather than the ships spending longer in port) and that the shipping fleet is \ndownsized, either by sale or lease of one or more vessels. \n \n14.  Other sources of benefits are: \n \n(i)  reduced risk of rain or seawater water spoilage and handling damage where \ncargo transfer is from a vessel alongside rather than via lightering; valued at 1% \nof the free on board value of the cargo assuming values of $100 per ton for copra \nand $1,000 per ton for imported merchandise; \n(ii)  savings in passenger travel time\u2014valued at $3.50 per day weighted mean based \nupon 10% of passengers traveling during paid employment, and nonworking time \nvalued at 40% of work time; the work time value has been estimated from gross \ndomestic product and working population; \n(iii)  reduced risk of passenger injury, scaled according to the type of landing facility \nand difficulty of embarkation/disembarkation and passage through the surf zone \nfor small craft; \n(iv)  savings in risk of grounding and damage to ships and ship's boats through \nimproved navaids and beach channels; valued at 1.25% of the replacement \nvalue of the interisland fleet per year estimated at $4 million; \n(v)  shore  labor  cost  savings\u2014valued  at  the  implied  value  of  time  for  copra \nharvesting of 20 cents per hour; and \n(vi)  trade-offs between reduced costs of ships boats, increased costs of lagoon boat \ntransport and road transport are almost self-canceling so have been omitted. \n \n15.  Many unquantifiable benefits accruing to the outer island communities have not been \ntaken into the cash-flow analysis. In particular there will be social and welfare benefits to be \nderived  from  (i) improved  access  to  outer  island  communities  for  the  field  trip  medical, \neducation, public awareness, and other government service teams; (ii) easier and more frequent \ninteraction with other parts of the country; and (iii) better outer island project implementation as \nsupplies and technical support can more easily be sent to project sites. \n ", "54  Appendix 10 \nD.  Internal Rate of Return \n \n16.  The evaluation has been carried out over a 20-year investment period which generally \ncorresponds to the design life of the navigation marks (25 years for civil works and 5 to 10 years \nfor lights), and the jetties (25 years for good maintenance, 15 years for poor maintenance). The \nProject achieves a 14.5% economic internal rate of return. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates \nthat the Project is robust and remains financially viable even with adverse movements in some \nparameters  such  as  lower  project  benefits,  increase  in  capital  cost,  and  delay  in  project \nimplementation. The results of sensitivity analyses, given in the table below, testing project \nviability for primary parameters also demonstrates robust economic viability of the Project. \n \nTable A10.1: Sensitivity Test \n \n  EIRR  Sensitivity  NPV  Sensitivity \n(%)  Indicator  ($ million)  Indicator \nBase Case  14.5    1.33   \n1.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  completed  as  part  of  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Infrastructure Projects \nand the consulting firm\u2019s report is included in the feasibility study report. This summary IEE is \nprovided for evaluation purposes on the environmental impacts and mitigating measures of a \ntypical subproject. The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) was also consulted in the \nenvironmental assessment. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  A detailed description of the Project is given in paragraphs 25 to 49 of the main report \nand recommendation of the President. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  Physical Environment. The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) has a total land \narea of only 110 square kilometers (km2) spread over 1,225 individual islets, the largest no more \nthan  0.8 km2.  The  atolls  and  islands  of  the  RMI  are  made  up  of  coral  reef  material  and \nsediments that have formed over submarine volcanoes. The islands and atolls vary in shape \nand size from small isolated islands with no central lagoon (Mejit, Jabat, Kili, and Lib), to small \natolls with totally enclosed lagoons (Namorik), and to larger atolls with one or many breaks in \nthe reef, the largest being Kwajalein Atoll with a lagoon area of 839 km2. The width of the land \narea on the atolls is frequently only 100 meters (m) to 300 m, and exceptionally up to 2 km. The \nislets are low and flat, generally higher on the ocean side, but usually no more than 3 m. Most \nlagoons have one or more deep passes through the surrounding reef with high tidal flows and \noften strong currents. Approaches to beaches on the lagoon side are frequently obstructed by \nwide reef flats, in some places up to 2 kms width. These reef flats are generally up to 2 m depth \nbelow mean sea level with large areas exposed at low tide. \n \n4.  Terrestrial Flora and Fauna. According to the National Environmental Management \nStrategy, there is no record of the original vegetation and fauna of the Marshall Islands, and no \nendemic terrestrial species are known today. Disturbance by human habitation of over 3,000 \nyears has probably altered the vegetation through the introduction of plants as sources of food \nand craft material, and also exotic mammals\u2014pigs, chickens, cats, dogs, and rats. There are 70 \nrecognized avian species, mostly migratory seabirds. One, the Ratak Micronesian Pigeon, is \nlisted as an endangered species. Reptiles consist of seven lizard species and one blind snake, \nall introduced. Insects and spiders are abundant. Coconut crabs (birgos latro and coenobita \nrugosa)  are  found  on  coconut  plantations  and  are  highly  valued  for  their  flesh  but  are \nendangered. \n \n5.  Marine Flora and Fauna. There is a diverse array of coral and invertebrate species \ninhabiting the reefs and the inter-tidal zone, including sponges, whelks, clams, oysters, mussels, \ngastropods, tunicates, worms, crabs, shrimps, sea cucumbers, and starfish. All five of the \nworld's species of marine turtle inhabit the islands. At least two of these species, the green turtle \n(chelonia mydas) and hawksbill turtle, are endangered. A number of other marine mammals, \nmainly dolphin and whale species, are also endangered. \n ", "  Appendix 11  57 \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n  1.  Navigation Aids \n \n6.  The construction technique for placing navigation marks involves percussion drilling into \ncoral, often below high water mark and sometimes below low water mark. Depending on the \nconstruction method adopted, it may be necessary to place a working platform mounted on \njacks temporarily on the reef. In either case there will be some disturbance to the reef at the \npoints chosen, although the area of effect will be very small and permanent modification will be \nnegligible. The magnitude of effects from placement of navigation aids (navaids) will be minor. \n \n  2.  Beach Channels \n \n7.  Creation of beach channels is likely to be the most environmentally sensitive aspect of \nthe Project. However, the scale of the effect in relation to the length of shoreline is minor, and in \nalmost all cases the sites chosen have previously been modified by past efforts at channel \ncreation. The construction activity will involve excavation of coralline rock and soft sediments to \ncreate beach channels. This work will generally be carried out at low tide by mechanical \nequipment that works out slowly from the shore, using the excavated material to provide a \nworking platform that may be removed at the completion of the work or left in place to form a \nbreakwater where this is desirable (in which case rock armor would be applied on completion). \nMitigation  measures  that  can  be  considered  include  maximizing  the  amount  of  excavation \ncarried out in the dry at low tide, and the creation of a silt fence around the works. A silt fence \nwould require temporary steel piles into the lagoon bed to which filter cloth would be attached \nand  consideration  is  required,  for  each  site,  of  whether  the  disturbance  and  cost  of  this \nmitigation work is warranted. Fill areas will be selected to minimize effects on living coral \ncolonies. \n \n  3.  Docks and Reef Platforms \n \n8.  There are three locations (Malel on Arno, Jittoen on Ebon, and Jeh on Ailinglaplap) \nwhere new dock construction at the beach is proposed and one location where the proposal is \nfor a transfer dock at the reef edge (reef platform) (Mejit). Repairs to, or extensions of, existing \nstructures are planned at Buoj on Ailinglaplap, Likiep, Taroa on Maloelap, and Wotje on Wotje. \nIn all cases the docks are at locations where ships already anchor, so the environmental effects \nof ship calls are not significantly altered (pollution effects such as leakages, discharges, and \nrefuse).  Land-based  impacts  will  include  some  temporary  disruption  from  the  location  of \nconstruction plant and materials close to the site, which will involve some temporary occupation \nof land, construction noise, dust, and hazards from the use of heavy machinery. Mitigation \nmeasures will include fencing off the working area for safety purposes and a requirement on the \ncontractor to restore the working area as closely as possible to its initial condition. \n \n9.  In three cases (Imiej, Taroa, and Wotje) the docks to be extended are World War II \n(WWII) docks. There are three existing docks at Wotje, any of which could be selected as the \ndock to be extended. There is a need for a pragmatic approach to the conservation of WWII \nstructures that are still in use, as conservation requirements must be balanced with the social \nand economic development of current and future generations. \n ", "58  Appendix 11 \n  4.  Warehouses \n \n10.  Construction of warehouses will involve land acquisition and temporary disruption of a \nminor  nature  during  construction.  Materials  will  generally  be  prefabricated,  imported  and \nassembled  on  site,  with  the  exception  of  the  building  platform  and  foundation  slab.  No \nsignificant environmental effects are anticipated. \n \n  5.  Track Improvements \n \n11.  In most cases, for existing vehicle tracks and walking paths, the scale of this work is very \nminor and will involve localized clearance of vegetation, widening and placement of small \namounts of coral surfacing won from the adjacent ocean side beach ridge. For a few locations, \nconstruction of new track is envisaged. In this case the physical effects will be more significant \nand will involve location of a 3 m wide route (4 m clearance strip), removal of vegetation and \norganic soils, import, placement and rolling of small volumes of coral material won from selected \nquarry locations on ocean or lagoon side beaches above the high tide mark. Construction \nequipment will comprise a small bulldozer, truck, excavator, and roller imported by landing craft. \nMitigation measures to be considered will include route selection that minimizes removal of \nbearing coconut palms and other food trees, as well as avoidance of houses, funeral plots, and \nfood gardens. Extraction of coral material for road base will be from preselected locations to a \nmaximum volume and with quarry site restoration plan to avoid the creation of foreshore erosion \nproblems or ponding of rainwater that could constitute a health hazard. \n \n  6.  Airstrip Rehabilitation \n \n12.  The work will include clearing of all vegetation (some up to 3 m in height) back to the \nlines of coconut trees that are parallel to the existing airstrips. The surface of the runway section \nof the airstrips will be regraded and all obstacles (such as rocks and tree stumps) removed. The \nrunway areas will then be rolled and compacted and topped up with coral gravel and sand if \nrequired. It is considered that only small amounts of fill will be required and its excavation will be \na minor activity if material is won from several different areas around the atoll rather than from \none location. \n \n  7.  Extraction of Quarry Material \n \n13.  A small quantity of armor rock for breakwaters will be obtained through drilling, blasting, \nand extraction by rock grab and bucket excavator from selected locations on the ocean side reef \nflat. Where this excavation is necessary, the EPA has developed criteria for minimizing the \nadverse environmental effects by requiring the rock cuts to be more than 30 m in from the reef \nedge and more than 30 m out from the shoreline. Cuts are square sided to promote later \nregrowth of coral on the vertical faces. Other excavation will generally be of beach sand and \ncoral rubble from lagoon or ocean sides at preselected locations. In some cases, where material \nis not available on land, dragline recovery from the lagoon may be required. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n14.  The responsibility for future environmental management of the proposed wharf and \nfacilities at these subproject areas will lie with the project proponent, which would be the \nMinistry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC). This entity represents the government \ninterest in the facilities. All the measures that have been specified in this document will be \nincorporated  in  the  construction  documents,  plans  and  specifications  to  ensure  its ", "  Appendix 11  59 \nimplementation.  The  EPA  and  MOTC  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  mitigating \nmeasures. \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n15.  The adverse environmental effects of the Project will be generally confined to the inter-\ntidal zone within atoll lagoons and land areas in the vicinity of tracks and warehouses. These \nimpacts will be highly localized in terms of significance range from minor impact, particularly \nwhen the zone of effect on marine ecology is compared with the overall length of shoreline in \nthe area with similar environmental values. \n \nG.   Conclusion \n \n16.  The Project does not warrant a detailed environmental impact assessment study, and \nwill not have any significant impacts on the environment. \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION CONSULTING SERVICES \n \nA.  Terms of Reference \n \n  1.  Introduction \n \n1.  These terms of reference (TOR) are for the provision of engineering services by an \ninternational consulting firm (the Consultant) for the procurement of the Outer Islands Transport \nInfrastructure Project. The TOR set out the scope of the Project, the scope of work of the \nConsultant, general design specifications, and deliverable schedules. \n \n2.  The Consultant will be responsible for (i) obtaining all necessary site data; (ii) overseeing \nall  investigations;  (iii) undertaking  detailed  design;  (iv) preparation  of  tender  documents; \n(v) calling and evaluating tenders; and (vi) construction monitoring and management. \n \n3.  The Consultant will be appointed under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. Procurement of the main construction contract will be undertaken by \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) under ADB's Guidelines for Procurement under Asian \nDevelopment Bank Loans. \n \n4.  The site investigation, detailed design, contractor prequalification, and tendering stages \nare expected to occupy 6 months, commencing in January 2003, and the construction a period \nof 2.5 years. \n \n  2.  Site Investigation \n \n5.  The Consultant will: \n \n(i)  visit the site of each subproject and confirm the locations for all proposed works \nusing a reliable means of global positioning, such as the Global Positioning \nSystem, plus means of identification relative to local fixed features. This will \ninvolve discussions with local communities on the precise location of proposed \nbuildings and track improvements; \n(ii)  identify any issues regarding the use of land, resettlement requirements (if any), \nleasing, and compensation. These issues are to be conveyed to the executing \nagency for resolution. The consultant will assist the Government in obtaining \nresolution prior to the award of contracts for construction; and \n(iii)  prepare TOR and bid documents for comprehensive site investigation. \n \n6.  The scope of the site investigation will be assessed based on the investigations carried \nout during the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA).1 The Consultant will review the \nscope of the proposed investigation and list of project locations and confirm the suitability of the \nlocations  or  adjust  them  as  required,  before  commissioning  the  site  investigation.  The \nconsultant will then prepare TOR for the site investigation to enable this to be determined in as \nmuch detail as possible and competitively bid. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Marshall Islands for Preparing the Outer Islands Transport \nInfrastructure Project. Manila. ", "  Appendix 12  61 \n7.  The site investigation will include, as a minimum: \n \n(i)  Hydrographic surveys to appropriate accuracy of all marine sites, including the \ndetermination of tidal parameters for each site including: (a) highest astronomical \ntide, (b) mean high water springs, (c) mean high water neaps, (d) mean sea \nlevel, (e) mean low water neaps, (f) mean low water springs, and (g) lowest \nastronomical tide. \n(ii)  Topographical surveys of all land sites. Topographic surveys must be related to \nthe tidal datum. A permanent survey mark or marks must be built at each site, \nsurveyed  and  position  and  heights  recorded  in  terms  of  the  datum.  A  local \ncoordinate datum may be established, however this datum must be coordinated \nin  terms  of  longitude  and  latitude.  Location  plans  for  each  mark  are  to  be \nprepared. \n(iii)  Geotechnical investigations of proposed dock and channel sites and at least one \nrepresentative reef pass site. \n(iv)  Collection, collation, and analysis of wind and wave data for the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands (RMI), using available data. This is to include data from tropical \nstorms, sufficient to allow suitable design criteria to be established. \n(v)  Environmental  investigations  required  to  complete  an  environmental  impact \nassessment  in  accordance  with  the  RMI  Environmental  Regulations  for  all \nsubprojects in discussion with and in accordance with the requirements of the \nRMI\u2019s Environmental Protection Authority. \n(vi)  Investigations required to complete a cultural assessment in accordance with the \nHistoric Preservation Office Regulations for all subprojects in discussion with and \nin accordance with the requirements of the RMI Historic Preservation Office, with \nparticular reference to any site that is noted by the Historic Preservation Office as \npotentially sensitive. \n(vii)  Such other information that the Consultant deems necessary to complete the \nProject. \n \n8.  The Consultant will specify the outputs and standards required of those carrying out the \ninvestigations. \n \n  3.  Detailed Design Parameters \n \n9.  Indicative design criteria, established during the PPTA, are given below. The Consultant \nshould  satisfy  himself  that  these  design  criteria  are  an  optimum  economic  design  and \nappropriate  to  the  conditions,  in  addition  to  any  other  criteria  established  as  part  of  the \nConsultant's work. \n \n(i)  Design life for marine navigation aids (navaids) and warehouses of 20 years, and \nfor marine structures and airstrip extensions 50 years. \n(ii)  All structures designed to withstand a 100-year return period storm event. For \nreef pass navaids, damage to (including loss of) the top mark and light during \nsuch an event is acceptable. The support system should withstand the design \nevent. \n(iii)  All structures designed to an accepted design standard, such as those of the \nStandards Australia/New Zealand, Japanese Standards Association, American \nConcrete  Institute,  and  International  Association  of  Lighthouses  Authorities \n(IALA). ", "62  Appendix 12 \n(iv)  All  materials  used  and  structures  designed  to  minimize  the  amount  of \nmaintenance that will be required; this applies in particular to the reef pass lights. \n(v)  Superimposed live loads, to cater for loading of copra and unloading of general \ncargo such as food and building materials. Some of the incoming goods may be \npalletized but most cargo is break-bulk. None of the present vessels handle \ncontainers. There are generally only light vehicles in the outer islands, such as \n1.5-ton  pickup  trucks,  which  would  be  used  to  unload  and  transport  cargo. \nDesign superimposed spread load capacity of 15 kiloPascal, and design axle \nload of 5 tons have been assumed. \n(vi)  Berthing loads\u2014in most cases, berthing will take place with an offshore wind \n(docks on east side of atoll, inside lagoon, prevailing wind east-northeast). The \ncurrent vessels do not have bow thrusters. A design allowance for berthing \nspeed  of  0.5  meters  (m)  per  second  and  approach  angle  of  15  degrees  is \nrecommended. \n(vii)  Mooring loads should allow for the possibility of ships being moored beam onto \nprevailing  winds.  A  minimum  bollard  capacity  of  10  tons  is  recommended. \nBollards  should  be  located  to  facilitate  mooring  of  the  vessels  in  the  most \npracticable manner, given the constraints of the narrow access structures and \nrelatively small dock tee heads. \n(viii)  Ship data\u2014the vessels being used at present are all small coastal freighters, \ntypically using deck gear to transfer cargo into and from one or a pair of forward \nholds. The ships have some passenger capability. The following ship design \nparameters have been chosen as an envelope of the present ship sizes as it is \nlikely these vessels will be in service well after the new structures are complete: \n(a) draft less than 3.7 m, (b) molded depth less than 5.1 m, (c) length overall less \nthan  53.0 m,  (d)  beam  less  than  9.0 m,  (e) displaced  tonnage  less  than \n1,500 tons,  and  (f)  under-keel  clearance  a  minimum  of  1 m,  at  the  lowest \npredicted astronomical tide is required. This value should be increased where \nlarger waves can be expected. \n \n  4.  Outline Specification of the Works \n \n10.
