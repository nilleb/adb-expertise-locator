INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  International  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards  Board  (IPSAS  Board)  is  a \nstandards-setting body designated by and operating under the auspices of the International \nFederation of Accountants (IFAC).1 One of the main functions of the IPSAS Board is to develop \nfinancial  reporting  standards  for  public  sector  entities.  From  1997  to  2008,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  provided  three  phases  of  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  to \nsupport the IPSAS Board's standards-setting program.2  \n \n2.  During the third phase, the IPSAS Board set standards for employee benefits, changes \nin foreign exchange rates, impairment of cash-generating assets, and disclosure by recipients of \nexternal assistance.  \n \n3.  Additionally, the IPSAS Board issued five new standards3 and revised 12 more. Several \nstudies on accounting issues were undertaken.4 The IPSAS Board also initiated a conceptual \nframework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements in the public sector. \n \n4.  Standards set by the IPSAS Board provide the foundation for achieving the long-term \nobjectives of (i) moving toward cash-based or full-fledged accrual accounting for both developed \nand developing countries, and (ii) improving the quality and reliability of accounting and financial \nreporting for the public sector. Following successful completion5 of the first three phases of the \nTA, the proposed fourth phase is to support the IPSAS Board's 2009\u20132011 work program \n(Appendix 2) which focuses on producing a series of accounting guidelines and standards to \nimprove and strengthen accountability and transparency in public sector financial reporting. The \nIPSAS Board\u2019s work program is consistent with the ADB Strategy 20206 and its development \nagenda on good governance, anticorruption, and an enhanced government fiscal management \nsystem. \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  At the completion of the third phase of the TA, the IPSAS Board identified and prioritized \nseveral projects related to the convergence of International Public Sector Accounting Standards \nwith the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These included the following:  \n                                                 \n1  IFAC was established in 1973 and was formally approved by the International Congress of Accountants in 1977. \nIFAC  is  the  global  organization  for  accountancy  profession  dedicated  to  serving  the  public  interests  by \nstrengthening the profession and contributing to the development of strong international economies. The IFAC \nBoard established the public sector committee in 1986 to issue pronouncements on accounting, auditing, and \nreporting in the public sector on IFAC\u2019s behalf. Effective 10 November 2004, IPSAS Board replaced the public \nsector committee. \n2  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance for Government Accounting Standards.

Exposure drafts8 were developed in 2008 and approved in 2009. \nThe IPSAS Board anticipates approving these standards in late 2009. \n(ii)  Equity  combinations\u2014convergence  with  IFRS  3:  Business  Combinations  as  well  as \nseparate related public sector specific projects.9 The exposure draft was approved in \n2009, while the public-sector-specific part is targeted to be completed in 2011. \n(iii)  Intangible assets\u2014convergence with IAS 38: Intangible Assets. \n(iv)  Agriculture\u2014convergence with IAS 41: Agriculture. \n \n6.  The IPSAS Board continues to make significant progress on projects that are specific to \nthe public sector. \n(i)  Conceptual  framework  for  public  sector  financial  reporting.  A  very  significant \nmilestone  for  the  project  was  the  issuance  of  the  phase  1  consultation  paper \n(Conceptual  Framework  for  General  Purpose  Financial  Reporting  by  Public  Sector \nEntities:  The  Objectives  and  the  Scope  of  Financial  Reporting,  The  Qualitative \nCharacteristics of Information included in General Purpose Financial Reporting, The \nReporting Entity).   \n(ii)  Long-term fiscal sustainability. A project brief paper was issued in 2008 and a task \nforce  was  formed  to  develop  a  framework  for  governments  to  develop  fiscal \nsustainability reports. \n(iii)  Service concession arrangements and public\u2013private partnerships. A consultation \npaper was issued in 2008 (Accounting and Financial Reporting for Service Concession \nArrangements), and, after additional analysis and consultations, an exposure draft was \ndeveloped. The estimated project completion is 2010\u20132011.  \n(iv)  Review  of  the  cash-basis  standards.  The  review  is  ongoing  and  scheduled  for \ncompletion in 2010\u20132011. \n(v)  Social  benefits.  An  exposure  draft  (ED  34;  Social  Benefits:  Disclosure  of  Cash \nTransfers to Individuals and Households) was issued in March 2008. During further \nconsultations in October 2008 it was agreed to defer development of the standards until \nthe conceptual framework project is completed. \n(vi)  Financial instruments. At its October 2008 meeting, the IPSAS Board considered the \nfinancial  instruments  project  in  the  context  of  the  global  financial  crisis  and  three \nexposure drafts were approved in March 2009. The exposure drafts for non-contractual \nitems, such as taxes, will be developed during 2009\u20132011. \n \n7.  These projects will be further developed during the fourth phase of the TA, which will \nsupport the IPSAS Board standard's development program in 2009\u20132011. During consultations \nwith representatives of the member countries of the IPSAS Board, developing member country \n(DMC) governments, accounting bodies, the accounting profession, and multilateral financial \ninstitutions, the IPSAS Board recognized the complexity of establishing accounting standards \nfor the public sector and strengthened the work program for the next phase to address the \nconcerns and issues that had been raised. \n \n                                                 \n7 IAS 32: Financial Instruments Presentation, IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and \nIFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures. \n8 \"Exposure drafts\" are issued by IPSAS Board and posted on the IFAC website for comment.   \n9  The IPSAS Board is also working on a project that addresses entity combinations where the combining entities are \nunder common control and the combination is a non-exchange transaction. \n ", "  3 \n8.  While the IPSAS Board has developed and produced a series of accounting guidelines, \nstandards, and studies under the previous phases of the TA, many important tasks remain to be \ncompleted. Given the global financial crisis, the development of a new set of standards for \nrecognition and  measurement  of  financial  instruments,  and  the  updating  of  disclosure  and \npresentation requirements, is important if the public sector is to have a robust set of accrual \nbased accounting standards.  \n \n9.  The IFAC Group of Twenty (G20) accounting summit10 called attention to the urgency of \nthe standards convergence program for the public sector, which has proceeded more slowly \nthan convergence in the private sector. Faster progress is critical to enhance sound regulations, \nstrengthen transparency and the financial reporting infrastructure, and improve the financial \nmanagement capabilities of countries. Because the IPSAS Board has lacked resources in the \npast, a significant gap in accounting standards has opened up between IPSAS and IFRS. \nCurrently, the IPSAS Board is trying hard to close this gap.   \n \n10.  At  the  G20  IFAC  summit,  it  was  acknowledged  that  IPSAS  can  only  be  properly \nimplemented if public sector bodies have professionally qualified accountants with appropriate \ntechnical  skills.  To  achieve  financial  stability  and  develop  the  capacity  of  the  accounting \nprofession  in  developing  and  emerging  economies,  a  number  of  initiatives,  including  a \nframework for building sustainable capacity for the accounting profession, are being undertaken \nthrough the member body development group at IFAC in coordination with the IPSAS Board \nand other standards-setting boards.  \n \n11.  The IPSAS Board, under IFAC's lead,6 has undertaken a number of initiatives, including \nupdating  the  Study  on  Transition  to  the  Accrual  Basis  of  Accounting  \u2013  Guidance  for \nGovernments and Government Entities11 to reflect the 2009 IPSAS Board handbook. A second \nstage of updating will be undertaken in 2010. Additionally, the IPSAS Board held round table \nmeetings to review the problems in implementing the cash-basis IPSAS and an exposure draft \nwas posted. The IPSAS Board work program for 2009\u20132011 includes continuing to work on \ncapacity development initiatives and ADB, through its involvement in phase four of the TA, will \ndeepen its cooperation with the IPSAS Board in this area and will develop a professional \ntraining scheme to strengthen the capacity of accounting professionals. \n \n12  Improving accounting and financial reporting in the public sector is a long-term process. \nThe IFAC has asked ADB and its other development partners to continue financing its ongoing \ndevelopment program. A number of developing partners and bilateral donors have agreed to \nsupport the IPSAS Board's work program for 2009\u20132011 and to contribute to its budget. The \nWorld Bank has agreed to support the IPSAS program and has increased its contribution from \n$130,000 in 2007 to $250,000 a year from 2009.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  By supporting the IPSAS Board's work program for 2009\u20132011, this TA will enhance \naccountability and transparency in government financial reporting and accounting systems by  \n                                                 \n10 The IFAC G20 accounting summit was held in London on 23\u201324July 2009 to achieve consensus by the profession \non a series of recommendations to be made to G20 leaders on issues related to the financial crisis.  \n11 IFAC. 2004.

The expected impact of the TA will be improved public financial management. The \nexpected outcome will be enhanced accountability and transparency in government financial \nreporting and accounting systems. To date, 28 Asian and Pacific countries12 and 10 nonregional \nADB member countries13 either have adopted or are in the process of adopting IPSASs. In \n2009, Indonesia and the Kyrgyz Republic, among others, were in the process of adopting \nIPSAS or converging their national standards with IPSAS. Further progress in the adoption of \nIPSAS during 2009\u20132011 will help to strengthen financial governance in ADB's DMCs.  \n \n15.  The outcome will be achieved through the following outputs: (i) completion of agreed \npublic sector specific projects, (ii) approval of an IPSAS and IFRS convergence program; and  \n(iii) implementation of a communication strategy (Appendix 1). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The key activities of the fourth phase of the TA are to (i) complete the development of \npublic sector specific IPSAS (cash- and accrual-based); (ii) finalize IPSAS for the exposure \ndrafts under review; (iii) continue an extensive program  so IPSAS  converge with IFRS or \nnational standards; (iv) implement communication strategies to promote IPSAS; (v) continue to \ndevelop  public  sector  specific  projects,  including  a  conceptual  framework,  long-term \nsustainability, and service concession arrangements and public\u2013private partnerships projects; \nand (vi) work with IFAC on a capacity development program to strengthen the accounting \nprofession.  \n \n17.  With this continuing TA support, ADB will maintain its \u201cobserver\u201d status, along with other \nfunding agencies, and attend the IPSAS Board\u2019s conferences and meetings to ensure that the \nbest interests of ADB DMCs are taken into consideration in the different outputs of the IPSAS \nBoard's work program. \n \n18.  Copies of all IPSAS exposure drafts and studies can be downloaded free of charge at \nthe IFAC website (http://ifac.org). In addition, the information on the availability of translated \nversions of the IFAC's Handbook of International Public Sector Accounting Pronouncements,14 \nwill be disseminated to ADB DMCs through ADB resident missions.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The  total  cost  for  the  fourth  phase  work  program  for  2009\u20132011  is  estimated  at \n$5,197,000 equivalent ($1,732,333 per annum). ADB will provide $300,000 equivalent on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). Other multilateral aid \n                                                 \n12 The following countries in the Asia and Pacific region have adopted or are in the process of adopting IPSAS: \nArmenia, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, People's Republic of China, Timor-\nLeste, Fiji Islands, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Maldives, Malaysia, \nMongolia,  Nepal,  New  Zealand,  Pakistan,  Philippines,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Singapore,  Sri  Lanka,  Uzbekistan, \nVanuatu, and Viet Nam. \n13 The following nonregional member countries of ADB have adopted or are in the process of adopting or converging \nto IPSAS: Austria, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherland, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and \nUnited States. \n14 IFAC. 2009.

IFAC  will  provide  the  remaining  $2,627,000.  Details  of  the  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The IFAC will be the executing agency for the fourth phase of the TA. As ADB is only \ncontributing 5.8% to the IPSA Board's 2009-2011 work program budget, together with the World \nBank  and  other  organizations,  it  would  be  practical  and  efficient  for  IFAC  to  use  its  own \norganizational and administrative procedures, similarly to the arrangements in the previous \nthree phases of the TA. The IFAC will implement the TA through the IPSAS Board. ADB funds \nwill be used to cover part of the technical inputs of 6.5 full-time staff of the IPSAS Board, \ninternational  travel,  meetings,  conferences,  seminars,  workshops,  and  miscellaneous \nadministrative and support costs. No consulting services or equipment will be procured and \nfinanced from ADB funds. \n \n21.  TA implementation will commence in December 2009 and is expected to be completed \nin October 2012. The ADB funds will be released in three installments each amounting to \n$100,000. The first installment will be released upon receipt by ADB of the TA letter agreement \ncountersigned by IFAC. Two subsequent installments will be released based on the submission \nof (i) a financial statement of account showing the use of grant funds from various funding \nagencies, (ii) a copy of the audited financial statements of IFAC with supplementary information \non the IPSAS Board projects, and (iii) a brief annual progress report on the project activities \nsupported by the TA, as will be specified in the TA letter agreement to be executed between \nADB and IFAC. The IFAC will maintain separate records with respect to ADB's portion of the \nfinancing and provide to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year in which \nADB funds are utilized, a copy of the audited financial statements of IFAC with supplementary \ninformation on the IPSAS Board projects. \n \n22.  As an observer of the IPSAS Board, ADB will monitor and oversee TA activities. ADB \nwill also provide direct input to the work of the IPSAS Board by reviewing its exposure drafts, \nconsultation papers and ensuring that ADB member countries comments are addressed before \nIFAC issues any guidelines and directives.15 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis for \nPublic Sector Accounting Standards (Fourth Phase), and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.\n                                                 \n15 The Financial Management Practice Community Group within ADB will be utilized to seek consolidated institutional \ncomments on the exposure drafts, consultation papers, draft IPSAS, and other related papers.
