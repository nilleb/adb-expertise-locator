The  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  during  the  2008  country  programming  mission  for  technical \nassistance (TA) for Rural Pension Reform and Development. A fact-finding mission for this TA \nvisited Beijing on 5\u20138 May 2009. Following the discussions, an understanding was reached on \nthe objectives, scope, terms of reference, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation \narrangements of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n2.  The pension system in the PRC traditionally falls into two almost entirely unrelated parts: \n(i) a system for urban enterprise workers, and (ii) a system for civil servants. Reforms of the \nurban enterprise pension system started in the mid-1980s as part of the overall reform of state-\nowned enterprises. As a result of this reform initiative, a multi-pillared system with social pooling \nat  the  provincial  level  is  being  established.  The  urban  pension  system  is  currently  being \nexpanded to integrate part of the pension systems for civil servants and migrant workers. \n \n3.  Despite the need for urgent reform in the pension system for the rural population, reform \nhas been lagging behind that of the pension system for urban residents. This has been partly \ndue to the urgency for the pension system for urban residents, and partly due to lack of a clear \nconsensus on the direction, strategies, and modalities needed for rural pension reform. The \ntraditional argument that family support and land use rights are the best form of old age \nlivelihood protection for rural residents has gradually been losing ground because of dramatic \nand dynamic shifts in demography. The number of children per family is declining and the \nageing of the population in rural areas has been increasing. Moreover, over the last 20 years, a \nsilent socioeconomic revolution has been taking place. Almost one-third of the rural workforce \nhas ceased to be farmers and these workers have become wage laborers in local industries. \nThe marked increase in migration to towns and cities has also further blurred the rural\u2013urban \ndistinction. In addition, the trend of opening up of land ownership to private enterprise will also \nshake the foundation of rural areas' informal social protection mechanism that relied on land. \n \n4.  Factors making the reform of rural pensions more urgent are (i) the current priorities of \nthe Government, and (ii) the significant negative impact of the ongoing global financial crisis on \nthe  country's  economy.  The  Government  has  focused  its  efforts  on  the  reduction  of  the \ntraditional rural\u2013urban divide, and thus a rural pension system is seen as an important part of \nthe national social security system that will help unite the country and bridge the division \nbetween the urban and rural areas. Meanwhile, the global financial crisis has led to the loss of \nmillions of jobs, especially among migrant workers from the rural areas. The rural pension \nsystem has become particularly important to provide basic welfare safeguards for these workers. \nPolicy makers also believe that the pension system, particularly for the rural population, is a \ngood area of focus for the Government's stimulus package that was created in response to the \nfinancial crisis. The Government's long-term strategy until 2020 calls for 100% participation in \nurban and rural pension systems nationwide. \n \n5.  Since the 1990s, a number of rural pension pilot schemes have been tested in rural \nareas, including those mirroring multi-pillared urban pension schemes and those based on fully \nfunded individual accounts. However, due to the lack of fiscal support from the Government and \nfunding support from township and village enterprises, most pilots could only offer low-level \nbenefits. This made the pilot schemes less attractive for farmers to participate in, and thus, \nunsustainable. Since 2003, some local governments have started to support rural pensions with \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 July 2009. ", "2    \nfiscal  subsidies,  resulting  in  a  new  scheme  of  rural  pension  that  combines  \"subsistence \npension,\" which is government-funded, and individual account. This scheme is seen as more \nbeneficial  than  the  schemes  which  comprise  social  pooling  plus  individual  account  or  the \nindividual-account-only schemes.2 International experience also indicates that the Government's \nfiscal resources have to play a bigger role in rural pension systems. \n \n6.  The Government has decided to pilot test the rural pension scheme that is based on a \ncombination of subsistence pension supported by government funding and individual account. \nThe pilot testing will be conducted in 2009 in 200 counties nationwide before the scheme is \nreplicated in the rest of the counties. The Government hopes that many issues will be further \nstudied and discussed during the pilot test. These issues include (i) the sustainability of the \nsystem's  funding  mechanism,  (ii)  eligibility  criteria  and  benefit  levels  for  both  subsistence \npensions and individual accounts, (iii) a benefit adjustment mechanism to allow transferability \nfrom other pension schemes and portability across regions, (iv) the relationship with other social \nwelfare programs, and (v) fiscal responsibilities at each level of government.3  \n \n7.  There  are  challenges  in  the  administrative  aspect  of  the  pension  system's \nimplementation. The Social Insurance Administration4 has completed a survey of administrative \nsystems at various levels of government, and the survey showed mixed results. Some counties \ndo  not  yet  have  adequately  staffed  and  budgeted  rural  Social  Insurance  Administration \nbranches. The information system for rural pension operations is almost nonexistent. A possible \nstrategy to tackle the issue of weak institutional capability is to expand the mandates of urban \nand township social insurance administrations and the information system to cover rural pension \noperations. This requires substantial updates on operational procedures and investments in \ncapacity building and basic administrative and information technology infrastructure.  \n \n8.  It is important that the rural pension system is consistent with the PRC's overall social \nsecurity reform objectives. It also needs to be an integral part of the overall pension system to \nensure portability and transferability. In addition, policy analysis work must address the lack of \nan adequate policy, legal, and regulatory framework; the lack of an adequate administrative \nstructure; and the poor capacity to implement an appropriate rural pension system. The demand \nfor pension support resulting from the dynamic shifts in the demographic structure in the PRC \nshould also be determined. Furthermore, it is necessary to establish a database to monitor the \noperation of the rural pension scheme nationwide, and strengthen the Government's capability \nto monitor and guide the development of the rural pension system. \n \n9.  One of the key thrusts of ADB assistance under the 2008 country partnership strategy is \nto  support  inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development  by  focusing  operations  on  poorer \nprovinces  and  by  promoting  integrated  rural  and  urban  development.5 The  corresponding \nfinance sector operation under this thrust is the building of an inclusive, market-oriented rural \nfinance system and the provision of support to social safety nets and pension systems in \nresponse to the demographic shift in the PRC and the need to build a harmonious society. ADB \nhas been a key partner of the Government since the 1990s in supporting social security reforms \nand in building an enabling policy and regulatory environment. It has worked with government \nministries, social security administrations both at central and local government level, financial \n                                                 \n2  Theoretically, it is more effective since rural residents generally have no employer and their low incomes make \nthem less able to pay contributions to a social pool. \n3  The preliminary design of the scheme has the following features: (i) rural pensions are managed at the county level; \n(ii) central, provincial, and local governments will share the burden of fiscal support; (iii) the benefit level will be set \nat CNY50\u2013CNY60 per month; (iv) eligibility criteria for pensions include that a person is over 60 years old and that, \nif he or she has children, the children should also participate in the rural pension system.  \n4  The Social Insurance Administration is the operational arm of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security \nand oversees the operations of pensions, medical insurance, and three other social security schemes nationwide. \n5  ADB. 2008.

", "    3  \nmarket regulators, legislators, as well as social security funds on a wide array of different issues \nconcerning urban and rural pension and medical insurance reforms. In addition, it has been \nactively working with the Ministry of Civil Affairs on social assistance, in particular rural dibao \n(also known as the subsistence-level social welfare system, which helped catalyze the decision \nin 2007 to establish rural dibao nationwide).6 ADB is also currently working with government \nagencies  on  medical  financial  assistance.  It has  also  worked  extensively  with  government \nagencies and financial market participants on rural finance market development issues.  \n \n10.  Rural pension reform is a challenging area and it presents a unique opportunity for ADB \nto assist in building the rural pension system, not only as an important link for the social safety \nnets but also as a vital element in the rural financial infrastructure.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the TA will be the establishment of a well-functioning rural pension system \nto provide basic old-age income protection for the rural population. Its outcome will be an \nimproved policy and regulatory framework and strengthened financing mechanisms for the rural \npension system. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The key activities of the TA are (i) the provision of support to the implementation of the \n200 county pilots by providing guidance at the policy, operational, management, as well as \ntechnical levels; and (ii) the extraction of lessons in the areas of policy reform and in the \nformulation of operational procedures and technical parameters. The preliminary design and \nmonitoring framework of the TA is presented in Appendix 2.7 \n \n13.  Extensive field surveys of existing rural pension pilot programs will be conducted.8 The \ndata from these surveys will need to cover the demographic features and income levels of local \npopulations, and the economic development level of each locality. An assessment of the quality \nof the data will be needed for monitoring purposes. Moreover, targeted workshops and seminars \nwill be organized for different stakeholders at various stages of project implementation. In the \ninitial stage, workshops will be held with the executing agency (EA) to discuss the feasibility and \npracticability of the TA implementation plan. When field studies of typical regions and areas \nhave been completed, workshops will be organized to discuss lessons and to identify directions \nfor the next steps. Seminars will also be held for government officials and specialists to gather \ntheir  comments  on  draft  reports.  Knowledge  products  from  main  and  sub-reports  geared \ntowards higher-level policy and decision makers are envisaged under the TA.9  \n \n14.  The TA outputs will include one main report and three sub-reports. \n \n(i)  Main report: Sustainability analysis of the rural pension system nationwide. \nThe  topics  of  the  main  report  will  include  (a)  an  overview  of  the  historical \n                                                 \n6  ADB TA helped catalyze the decision in 2007 to establish rural dibao nationwide. ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Facility for Reform Support and Capacity Building. Manila (TA 4790-PRC). \n7  The TA will also assess all relevant lessons from earlier pension reform programs, including many assisted by ADB \nin its developing member countries.  \n8  Past experience shows surveys based on questionnaires are not effective.  \n9  The potential topics to be covered by knowledge products include (i) how to provide adequate incentives to \nenhance willingness of rural residents to participate in the rural pension system; and (ii) how to share the financial \nburden among central, provincial, and local governments to ensure efficiency and minimize moral hazard, etc.  \n ", "4    \ndevelopment and current situation of, and problems concerning, the rural pension \nsystem in the PRC; (b) a description of the current policy, legal, regulatory, and \nadministrative frameworks of the PRC's pension system; (c) a discussion of the \nelements that will affect the revenue and expenditure of a rural pension fund; and \n(d) a discussion of the policy conditions that are needed for the development of a \nsustainable and effective rural pension system. The main report will also need to \nprovide recommendations leading to policy, legal, regulatory, and administrative \nreforms. It will also provide an outlook for rural pension development in the \ncoming two decades, based on which it will project the sustainability of the \nsystem, the financial obligations at each level of the government, and potential \nimpacts of the rural pension system on the urban pension system. \n \n(ii)  Sub-report 1: Projection of, and quantitative analysis on, the sustainability \nof  the  rural  pension  system  nationwide.  The  sub-report  presents  the \nquantitative analysis for the rural pension system nationwide. It will have two \nparts. Part 1 will develop a projection model for the aggregated revenue and \nexpenditure of the rural pension system nationwide based on relevant policy \nassumptions and parameters. It will also project rural pension demand and the \nrequired funding support from fiscal resources for the next 20 years, and assess \nthe sustainability of the rural pension system. Part 2 will use actuarial tools to \nlook at a typical rural pension participant in detail, and project if his or her \nindividual account could be self-balanced. \n \n(iii)  Sub-report 2: Projection of, and quantitative analysis on, the sustainability \nof the pension system in typical rural areas in western and central PRC. \nThe sub-report will conduct case studies of the rural pension schemes in sample \nareas (one in central and one in western PRC), and build a projection model for \neach of these areas using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methodologies. It \nwill then project funds demand and the financial supportability of the system over \nthe next 20 years. The quantitative model will need to identify key bottlenecks \nwith regard to the operation of rural pension funds in the central and western \nareas of the PRC. Based on the analysis of these bottlenecks, the report will offer \nrecommendations to overcome identified difficulties to ensure the balanced and \nsustainable growth of the rural pension system. \n \n(iv)  Sub-report  3:  Database  design  for  monitoring  the  operation  of  rural \npensions. The sub-report will lead to the establishment of a set of indicators for \nthe rural pension information system, reflecting, among other factors, coverage, \nindividual  accounts  revenue  and  expenditure  flows  and  outstanding  amount, \ninvestment portfolio, and investment returns. It will also help design the database \nfor monitoring the operation of the rural pension system, including the structure of \nthe database, recommended software, and recommended data collection and \nreporting procedures.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB \nto finance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \n \n ", "    5  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The  proposed  EA  is  the  Ministry  of  Human  Resources  and  Social  Security.  An \ninterdepartmental working group will be set up within the ministry, comprising the International \nCooperation  Department,  Rural  Pension  Department,  Social  Insurance  Administration,  and \nInformation Center. Other ministries and agencies that will be regularly consulted during project \nimplementation include the Ministry of Finance and the National Development and Reform \nCommission. The EA will provide the necessary office space, counterpart staff, transportation, \nand other services to the consultants and will arrange meeting appointments for the consultants \nwith relevant agencies and organizations.  \n \n17.  The TA will engage one international consultant and four national consultants for a total \nof 25 person-months, with the national rural pension policy specialist acting as the team leader. \nOutline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  consultants  will  be \nselected and engaged by ADB on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed  in  line  with the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook.10 For  equipment, \ntraining seminars, and conferences, an advance payment facility could be used. \n \n18.  The TA is expected to begin in October 2009 and end in December 2010. The first \nphase, which will involve implementation planning and the identification of pilot locations in the \ncentral and western regions, will be completed in 3 months. The second phase will involve the \nconduct of field studies, surveys, and workshops for reviewing preliminary findings. It will be \ncompleted in another 3 months. The third phase, which will be the preparation of draft final \nreports, will take a further 3 months. The fourth and final phase, during which the final workshop \nwill be conducted and the TA final reports completed, will take another 3 months. The remaining \n3 months is allocated for consulting services contract completion. \n \n19.  In addition to the main outputs, the consultants will submit to both ADB and the EA (i) an \ninception report 2 weeks after the commencement of their services, (ii) interim progress reports \nat appropriate stages during TA implementation, (iii) a draft final report before the conclusion of \nthe contract, and (iv) a final report 2 weeks after receiving comments from the EA and ADB. All \nreports will be submitted in English and Chinese. Workshops will be organized periodically for \ndissemination of consultants\u2019 findings and discussion of policy recommendations. \n \n20.  Major project activities will be regularly monitored and reported on by the EA and ADB \nadministration missions. Consultants\u2019 reports will be presented at workshops and seminars \norganized for the validation of findings. Reports will be made available on ADB websites in \nEnglish and Chinese, if appropriate, and published whenever warranted. The findings of this TA \nwill also be presented at a regional workshop sponsored by ADB in November 2009.11 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.
