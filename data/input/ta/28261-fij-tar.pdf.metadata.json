INTRODUCTION\n1. In January 1994, the Government of Fiji requested Bank technical assistance (TA)\nfor the preparation of the Third Road Upgrading Project. A Bank Fact-Finding Mission visited\nFiji between 19 and 24 September 1994 and reached understandings with the Government on\nthe rationale, objective, scope, cost estimate, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and\nterms of reference for consultants. This TA paper was prepared on the basis of the Mission's\ndiscussions with the Government; observations in the field; and a review of data, studies, and\nreports.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Fiji is composed of 330 islands scattered over 150,000 square kilometers (sq km)\nin the South Pacific Ocean. About 100 of the islands are inhabited. About 75 per cent of the\npopulation live on Viti Levu and 20 per cent on Vanua Levu (see Maps). Fiji is experiencing\ncontinued economic growth and prospects for sustaining this are good. There is a need,\ntherefore, to ensure that the transport sector does not become a constraint to this economic\ngrowth, that the transport sector is efficient, and that future investments are directed to where\nthey can be most effective.\n3. The economic objectives of the Government, embodied in Parliamentary Paper\n1993/2 \"Opportunities for Growth - Policies and Strategies for Fiji in the Medium Term\" was\nendorsed by Parliament in April 1993. This Paper provides a comprehensive statement of\neconomic policy and, to a lesser extent, social policy. The main thrusts of economic policy are\nto (i) remove barriers to market competition, (ii) improve education and training opportunities for\nall citizens, and (iii) lessen Government involvement in activities that can be undertaken more\nefficiently by the private sector. These thrusts, as they are translated into policies for the transport\nsector, are (i) transport services and, increasingly, transport infrastructure to be provided by the\nprivate sector, (ii) economic return to be the main criterion in selecting transport infrastructure\ninvestment, (iii) promotion of competition through transport deregulation while maintaining safety\nstandards, (iv) putting transport facilities managed by statutory authorities on a commercial basis\nwith a minimum of cross-subsidy between activities, and (v) transport planning to be integrated\nwith other economic sector planning.\n4. Fiji has substantial infrastructure facilities, the majority of which were built between\nthe mid-i 960s and mid-i 980s. Because of the earlier thrust to expand the stock of facilities, the\nquality of infrastructure, particularly roads, deteriorated. In response, the Government initiated\na major rehabilitation and upgrading program starting in the mid-i 980s. Implementation of this\nprogram is continuing.2\n5. Fiji is well-served by international and regional shipping. lnterisland shipping is\nprovided by two competing roll on/roll off shipping services, but these do not extend to the outer\nislands where small passenger/cargo vessels provide infrequent and irregular services. The Port\nAuthority of Fiji has a Master Plan for the period 1994-i 998, the main components of which\ninvolve the development of the reclamation area at Suva port for use as a future container port\nwith associated related industries, and the repair and upgrading of Kings Wharf at Suva.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in September 1994.\nSince the mid-1980s, almost 1000 kilometers (km) of the road network have been upgraded or rehabilitated\nwith assistance from the Bank, World Bank and European Union. Of this total, over 680 km was rehabilitated\nunder the Bank-financed (Loan No. 912-FIJ) Road Maintenance Sector Project in the amount of US$13\nmillion approved on 20 October 1988. The Bank is also co-financing (Loan No. 1 164-EU) the Second Road\nUpgrading Project (147 km) in the amount of US$18 million approved on 18 June 1992.", "2\n6. Fiji has an international airport at Nadi while Nausori (near Suva) handles some\nregional traffic. In addition, there are some 20 other smaller airports and a few privately operated\nairstrips at tourist resorts. The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji has a Master Plan for Nadi extending\nto 2020 and involving runway and taxiway works, development of the terminal, and upgrading\nof air navigation facilities.\n7. The Fiji Sugar Corporation has permanent rail tracks totalling 595 kilometers (km)\nlong associated with its four mills. It also has about 100 km of portable track used for hauling\ncane from the fields to the main line. The permanent rail network appears to have reached its\nmaximum potential extent as further expansion would need to be in the foothills surrounding the\ncane growing areas. This terrain is unsuitable for rail because of the high costs associated with\nconstruction. The cane harvest is usually between 3.5-4.0 million tons annually and about half\nof this is transported by rail. Rail transport provided by the Fiji Sugar Corporation for the main\nline haul is free of charge, whereas growers bear the full cost of hauling the cane by road. The\ncost of transporting the rail trucks to the fields, laying of the portable line, loading of the trucks\nand the transfer of the trucks back to the main line is the responsibility of the grower. The use\nof more portable line and main line haul of cane would reduce the damaging effect on the road\nnetwork and lead to less costly road upgrading options and road maintenance.\n8. There are about 7,000 km of roads in the country of which about 5,000 km are\nunder the control of the Public Works Department (PWD), 200 km are under municipal\nauthorities, and the remaining 1,800 km are under the responsibility of various Ministries. PWD's\ncurrent expenditure plan, including the Second Road Upgrading Project, extends to the end of\n1997. There is a need, therefore, to prepare the next phase of the Government's investment\nprogram to continue upgrading the road network so that feasibility studies and detailed designs\ncan be completed by the end of 1997 to enable construction to commence in early 1998.\n9. There are an estimated 50,000 road vehicles in use in Fiji, of which half are private\ncars. Vehicle ownership is still low at one vehicle per 15 people. Bus transport provides\nextensive services and is entirely commercially operated. There is also an adequate fleet of taxis.\nHeavy road vehicles are limited by law to 30.8 tons gross weight and 8-ton axle loads, which is\nlow by international standards. Vehicle length limits of 10 meters (m) in conjunction with gross\nvehicle weights preclude the use of long articulated vehicles. There is an abundance of trucks,\nfrequently overloaded to some extent, hauling sugarcane during the harvesting season that lasts\nfor almost half the year. The greatest damaging effect, however, arises from overloaded trucks\nhauling gravel for construction purposes. Enforcement of loading restrictions and vehicle\ncondition is limited and many poorly maintained vehicles use the roads. This contributes to the\nhigh accident and fatality rates on the roads in Fiji.\n10. Government price controls in the transport sector have precluded appropriate\nincreases in both Government and private sector charges. Thus, prices have fallen far behind\ncosts in a number of areas which, for land transport, includes charges for road users. At\npresent, the costs of constructing and maintaining the road network are not passed on equitably\nas costs to the road users. Also, the levels of fines do not deter traffic offenders.\n11. Road transport is administered through three statutory authorities established\nunder the Traffic Act and is serviced by the Department of Transport within the Ministry of Public\nWorks, Infrastructure and Transport (MPWIT). These statutory authorities are the Central Traffic\nAuthority, which is concerned with the orderly and safe movement of traffic on the roads through\npowers, functions, and duties embodied in the Traffic Act; the Principal Licensing Authority,\nwhich licenses vehicles and drivers; and the Transport Control Board, which advises the\nGovernment on the operation of public service vehicles. Traffic safety is inherently a function of", "3\nthe Central Traffic Authority, but there is also a Road Safety Council that has acted as an\nadvisory body.\n12. PWD within MPWIT is the largest provider of land transport infrastructure in Fiji.\nIts role is principally road construction, maintenance, and upgrading of both public roads and\nroads controlled by other Ministries. PWD has three administrative divisions (Western, Northern,\nand Central/Eastern), each controlling about 1,650 km of the road network and employing\npermanent and temporary staff. PWD employs about 2,000 people to manage, maintain, and\nupgrade about 5,000 km of road at an average of 1 person per 2.5 km, a number far in excess\nof that used in developed countries where 1 person per 10 km has been found sufficient, utilizing\nless plant and equipment.\n13. Several of these policy issues are being tackled under the Second Road\nUpgrading Project1 and through Advisory Technical Assistance (ADTA)2. The issues being\naddressed under Loan No. 11 64-FIJ, ADTA 171 5-FIJ, and ADTA 171 6-FIJ include overloading\nof vehicles, road maintenance, use of the local contracting industry for construction and\nmaintenance work, road safety, and transport planning.\n14. A component of the Second Road Upgrading Project is addressing the issue of\noverloading. As a starting point, a consultative document circulated to Government departments\nand transport providers and users quantifies the damage caused to the road network by\noverloaded vehicles, and seeks their views on ways to address the present unsatisfactory\nsituation. The final document will be used as a basis for inputs into a revised Traffic Act and\nthe road expenditure and user charges study that will form part of the ADTA for Institutional\n7)3 \nStrengthening of the Transport Sector proposed for 1994 (see para. 1  Revision of the Traffic\nAct is presently being drafted in accordance with undertakings of Loan No. 11 64-FIJ and\nintroduces the Land Transport Authority, which would be a statutory authority combining the\nfunctions of the Transport Control Board, the Central Traffic Authority, and the Principal Licensing\nAuthority. The revised Traffic Act will provide enabling legislation to, inter atia, increase\ndimensions and axte loads of vehicles to come to internationally accepted standards, increase\nuser charges and traffic fines, and empower transport officers, in addition to the police to control\nroad vehicles and road traffic. Also, as a component of Loan No. 11 64-FIJ, road maintenance\nand equipment management specialists have been attached to each of PWD's divisions. These\nspecialists are building on earlier assistance to ensure that routine and periodic maintenance\nworks are institutionalized and cover programming, scheduling, costing, budgeting, implementing\nand monitoring of maintenance activities.\n15. Under TA No. 171 5-FIJ, the TA was, inter alia, expected to train Government\nofficials in planning the needs for future transport infrastructure in a rational rather than ad hoc\nmanner. This was to be achieved through the establishment and staffing of a Transport Planning\nUnit within PWD. Because of the reorganization of the Ministries concerned with transport and\nthe lack of suitable staff within PWD, the training did not materialize but a National Transport\nLoan No. 1 164-FIJ: Second Road Upgrading Project approved 18 June 1992 in the amount of US$18\nmillion.\nTA No. 1716-FIJ: Road Safety and Traffic Management in the amount of US$150,000 approved on 18 June\n1992; and TA No. 1715-FIJ: National Transport Sector Plan in the amount of US$400000 approved in 18\nJune 1992.\nThe proposed ADTA for Institutional Strengthening of the Transport Sector will be implemented in parallel\nwith the PPTA for the Third Road Upgrading Project to ensure that the private sector is fully involved in an\nensuing project and that satisfactory cost recovery policies are pursued.", "4\nSector Plan (NTSP) covering the short-term (1997-2001), medium-term (2002-2006), and long-\nterm (2007 onwards) was prepared.\n16. TA No. 171 6-FIJ has prepared, and is helping to implement, a road safety and\ntraffic management program. Components of the TA include the establishment and operation\nof a National Road Safety Council, funding of traffic safety programs initiated by the Council\nthrough a levy on the motor insurance industry, establishing and operating a revised traffic\naccident reporting and analysis system, speed zoning on roads, improving hazardous locations\nand training the police in accident reporting and analysis, and patrolling, as well as use of\nsoftware, hardware, and vehicles. To date, progress in implementing the TA is very satisfactory.\n17. The ADTA for Institutional Strengthening of the Transport Sector proposed for\n1994 will address institutional aspects of Government policy in the transport sector. The\nobjectives of the ADTA are (i) to support Government initiatives to promote private sector\ninvolvement in the transport sector, and (ii) to implement selected recommendations of the\nNTSP, drawn up in accordance with Government policy objectives for transport. Activities\nidentified for inclusion in the ADTA are (i) restructuring of PWD to facilitate private sector\ninvolvement in constructing and maintaining roadworks, (ii) the creation of a Transport Planning\nUnit under MPWIT and a study of funding and cost recovery mechanisms in the road subsector,\nand (iii) the introduction of a franchising scheme for outer island shipping services.\n18. The Bank's operational strategy for Fiji is consistent with the Government's\nobjectives embodied in Parliamentary Paper 1993/2. The Bank's strategic objectives include\nassistance to carry out policy reform based on greater market orientation and to support\nendeavors to provide vital services for the private sector. Adequate and efficient infrastructure\nis a key requirement for facilitating private sector development and overall economic growth.\nThe Bank's operational strategy identified improvement of physical infrastructure as a priority\narea to support the strategic objectives. Over the medium term, the Bank will also emphasize\nimprovement of the policy environment and, given the shortage of skills associated with recent\nemigration, will place priority on human resource development and institutional strengthening\nof key government agencies through the proposed ADTA for Institutional Strengthening of the\nTransport Sector.\n19. In line with the Bank's operational strategy and the Government's need to\nimplement transport infrastructure to support private sector endeavors, continuing the road\nupgrading program has been identified as a key component under NTSP. Road upgrading will\nbe complemented by Bank-assisted ongoing and proposed reforms in the transport sector.\nIll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n20. The TA aims to ensure that future investment in the road subsector is where it will\nbe most effective and contribute to the efficiency of the transport sector as a whole by taking\naccount of intermodal considerations and private sector initiatives.\nB.\t Scope\n21. The TA will help the Government to update feasibility studies where available, and\nto carry out new feasibility studies where needed, for upgrading 18 sections of roads totalling\n276 km on the islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni on recommendations of the NTSP. The\nlist of roads to be studied is attached as Appendix 1. The feasibility studies will be carried out\nin accordance with internationally accepted criteria for assessing economic, technical,", "5\ninstitutional, environmental, and social aspects. The terms of reference for consulting services\nare detailed in Appendix 2.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n22. The TA is estimated to cost US$640,000 equivalent, comprising US$523,000 in\nforeign exchange and US$117,000 equivalent in local currency (see Appendix 3). The Bank will\nfinance, on a grant basIs, a total amount of US$600,000 to meet the entire foreign exchange cost\n(US$523,000) and US$77,000 equivalent in local currency. The foreign exchange cost of the TA\nincludes consultants' remuneration, per diem, international travel, report production,\ncommunications, office supplies and equipment, technical equipment, travel costs of a\nGovernment official to attend contract negotiations between the Bank and the consultants at the\nBank's Headquarters, and contingencies. The local currency cost of the TA to be financed by\nthe Bank includes local transport, surveying for preliminary designs, and contingencies. The\nGovernment will provide the remaining US$40,000 equivalent in local currency through the\nprovision of counterpart staff, office facilities, support services and local transport costs of its\ncounterpart staff related to the TA. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA\ndoes not commit the Bank to finance any ensuing project.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n23. The TA will be carried out by a team of consultants to be engaged by the Bank\nfrom a firm, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA will\nrequire about 20 person-months of international consultants' services in the fields of transport\neconomics and planning, highway engineering and construction costing, bridge engineering and\nhydraulics, surveying, and environmental and social analysis.\n24. MPWIT will be the Executing Agency for the TA and PWD will be the Implementing\nAgency. MPWIT and PWD will coordinate closely with the Ministry of Finance and Economic\nDevelopment and the Central Planning Office to ensure effective liaison, data gathering, and\ndiscussion during implementation of the TA. MPWIT will appoint the Director, Roads and Airfields\nof PWD as Counterpart Project Manager to work with the consultants' Team Leader and to\nprovide coordination between the Government, its agencies, NGOs and the consultants.\n25. The TA will be carried out over a six-month period beginning in April 1995. The\nconsultants will submit a brief inception report within six weeks of the start of their services. A\ndraft final report will be submitted after completion of the feasibility studies, including an initial\nenvironmental examination and an initial social assessment, together with a summary\nenvironmental impact assessment and an environmental impact assessment as appropriate.\nAfter Government and Bank review of the draft final report, a tripartite meeting will be held in Fiji\nwith the consultants to review the consultants' findings and recommendations. The consultants\nwill submit the final report, taking into account comments of the Government and the Bank,\nwithin one month of receipt of the comments.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n26. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Fiji in an\namount not exceeding the equivalent of US$600,000 for the purpose of the Third Road\nUpgrading Project, and hereby reports his action to the Board.", "\t\n6 Appendix 1\nROADS TO BE STUDIED\n\t\n.p.

The main objectives of the consultants' services are to assist the Public Works\nDepartment (PWD) within the Ministry of Public Works, Infrastructure and Transport (MPWIT) in\ncarrying out feasibility studies for upgrading 18 sections of roads, totalling  276 km, on the\nislands of VW Levu, Vanua Levu and Taveuni and to formulate a project suitable for external\nfinancing.\nB.\t SCOPE\n2. The scope of the consultants' services will be to analyze the costs and benefits\nof upgrading the selected sections of roads. The roads will be divided into suitable homogenous\nlinks, where necessary, taking into account traffic volumes and proposed improvement levels for\nthe purposes of costing and economic evaluation. Under the Study, future traffic will be forecast\nand alternative improvement levels identified. For each of these improvement levels, construction\ncosts will be estimated to an accuracy acceptable for such feasibility studies, benefits assessed\nto normal, diverted and generated traffic and producers' surplus, as appropriate, maintenance\ncost savings analyzed and economic evaluations carried out. In addition, the consultants will\ncarry out environmental and social impact assessments of the recommended upgrading options.\nBased on the above analysis, the consultants will recommend upgrading of road sections\nsuitable for financing by external agencies.\nC. THE CONSULTANTS\n3. The TA will require about 20 person-months of international consulting services\nengaged from a firm in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. It is\nenvisaged that the experience of the consultants' team, one of whom would be nominated Team\nLeader, would encompass transport economics/planning, highway engineering and construction\ncosting, bridge engineering, surveying, and environmental and social assessment. The TA will\nbe carried out over a six-month period starting April 1995. The detailed scope of the work will\ninclude, but not necessarily be limited to, the following tasks:\n(i) review the current transport investment proposals in the light of available\nstudies, with particular emphasis on the road subsector and its intermodal\ndependencies;\n(ii) describe the administrative organizations involved with road development,\nand arrangements for funding their activities;\n(iii) review available traffic counts and origin-destination surveys and obtain\nany additional necessary information on the present pattern of traffic by\nvehicle type and mode in the
