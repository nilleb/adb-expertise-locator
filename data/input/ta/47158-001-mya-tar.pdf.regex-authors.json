INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to Myanmar will support the Ministry \nof Communications and Information Technology and the Ministry of Science and Technology in \ndeveloping comprehensive plans to enhance capacity for and to deliver effective and efficient e-\ngovernance  services.  In  a  reconnaissance  mission  and  fact-finding  mission  to  Naypyitaw, \nMyanmar during 11\u201317 March 2013 and 6\u201316 May 2013, respectively, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) discussed with government officials the design of an e-governance master plan and \nreview  of  capacity  for  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  in  a  context \nencompassing  academic  institutions.  Agreements  were  reached  on  the  impact,  outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of \nthe TA. Details are in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).1 \n \n2.  The TA has been included in the loans, grants, and TA pipeline propositions to the \nGovernment of Myanmar ensuing from ADB\u2019s country programming mission of 26 February\u201315 \nMarch 2013. The country programming mission determined the demand and priorities of the \nGovernment of Myanmar for ADB support based on the interim country partnership strategy, \n2012\u20132014 for Myanmar.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The outlook for Myanmar\u2019s economy is positive, bolstered by expected strong export \nearnings from resource-based commodities and an increase in foreign direct investment. ADB \nforecasts the country\u2019s gross domestic product to grow from about 6.3% in 2012, to about 6.5% \nin 2013, and 6.7% in 2014. Myanmar has recently opened its engagement with the rest of the \nworld. Therefore, many sectors of the economy need to be revived and upgraded to global \nstandards in order to bring inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. This requires \nenhancing  e-governance  delivery  and  capacity  for  supporting  systemic  institution-building \nactivities in core economic sectors. \n \n4.  In  its  efforts  to  improve  efficiency,  transparency  and  wider  reach  of  public  service \ndelivery,  the  Government  is  focusing  on  streamlining  its  processes  by  undertaking \nadministrative reforms initiatives. e-governance is expected to play a significant role in this effort. \nToward this end, the Government has established an interministerial task force for appraising \npublic services performance that is headed by a senior minister in the President\u2019s office and \nincludes  representation  at  deputy  minister  level  from  a range  of key  ministries. While the \ninitiative will eventually encompass all of government, it focuses initially on such key areas \nimpacting the economy as trade, investment, electricity, and telecommunications (see table). \n \n5.  One of the key issues facing the Government as it seeks to introduce ICT systems to \nhelp  strengthen  performance  of  public  services  is  the  lack  of  a  coherent  and  systematic \napproach to the design, evaluation, and adoption of such systems. This presents a real risk of \ngovernment agencies adopting systems on an ad hoc basis, and that such systems may prove \ninappropriate from a needs as well as cost-perspective basis. In such case, systems could \nprove incompatible in effectively sharing information between systems in the various agencies.  \nThis issue is particularly acute just now, since many development partners are offering support \nfor ICT systems.  \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 April 2013. \n2  ADB. 2012. Interim Country Partnership Strategy: Myanmar, 2012-2014. Manila \n ", "2   \n \n6.  A common framework is therefore needed to guide the design, evaluation, and adoption \nof  these  systems  in  order  to  ensure  their  cost-effectiveness,  interoperability,  and \nappropriateness while allowing them to effectively support the government\u2019s reform efforts. \nTherefore, such ICT solutions must be undertaken comprehensively by way of developing an e-\ngovernance  master  plan  that  identifies  and  satisfies  the  various  demands  in  a  systematic \nmanner.  \n \n7.  Essential in parallel with this, is to review ICT capacity in the country\u2019s ICT academic \ninstitutions in order to provide a supply of skilled human resources to nurture and support \ne-governance initiatives. The maturity of the country\u2019s ICT academic institutions in ICT discipline \nis  an  indicator  for  the  extent  of  the  supporting  environment  for  sustaining  e-governance \ninitiatives. Typically, this requires the use of ICT educational assets, research in ICT, and the \nfostering of innovation in implementing an e-governance program.  \n \n8.  In order to develop the skills of ICT graduates and academia, it is essential to bring new \ntechnology solutions by way of demonstration projects such as TV White Spaces, e-learning, e-\nlibrary  with content generation, tracking and search solutions. Such an approach will help \ngaining  practical  knowledge  in  emerging  technologies  which  will  foster  entrepreneurial \ncapabilities in the country. Hence, the e-governance approach must encompass big-picture \ndevelopment of an e-governance program for the country, including strengthening the supply \nside by reviewing ICT capacity in the ICT academic institutions. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced service delivery capacity and efficient public \nmanagement of public services in the country. Its outcome will be the adoption of an integrated \napproach to implementing government applications and online services to achieve enhanced \ncapacity for delivering public services. \n \nB.  Outputs \n10.  The deliverables of the TA include (i) design of an e-governance master plan and action \nitems, (ii) development of a sustainability action plan for ICT capacity enhancements in the \nidentified  ICT  academic  institutions,  and  (iii)  development  of  demonstration  initiatives  and \nknowledge transfer in academic institutions. Development of the e-governance master plan and \nreview of ICT capacities in academic institutions will include analysis of existing ICT capacity for \ne-government and build upon that analysis and existing capacity. \n \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will help the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology to design \nan e-governance master plan. The activities are (i) collecting e-governance demands from \nselected  ministries;  (ii)  developing  high-level  functional  and  technical  requirements;  (iii) \nevaluating and proposing resource requirements, organizational structure, e-governance project \nexecution methods, and performance baselines and targets; (iv) developing an e-governance \nICT architectural blueprint, including technical standards to which government agencies must \nadhere; and (v) identifying changes in policy and in business processes and procedures that are \nneeded for implementing e-governance in the identified functional areas. \n ", "3   \n \n12.  The national e-governance master plan will be developed using a sampling approach of \ncollecting e-governance information system requirements from selected functional areas. The \nrequirements will be used to extrapolate the e-governance architectural blueprint for the country. \nThe selected functions identified for the e-governance master plan, as suggested by the Ministry \nof Communications and Information Technology, are shown in the table below. \n \nFunctional Areas under the e-Governance Master Plan \n \nClassification \nService  Functional Area  System  of Area  Lead Agency \nGovernment-to-  Information and  Strengthening of  ICT  Ministry of \ncitizens  communication  government  infrastructure  Communications \nstructure  departments\u2019 portals  and Information \nand web information  Technology  \nmanagement \nImproving statewide \nconnectivity of public \ninstitutions \nStreamline access to \ninformation through \ntelecenter-based \nservices \nEstablishing cross \ninfrastructure \nleveraging for \ntelecommunications \nbroadband (using \noptical fiber \ninfrastructure) \nGovernment-to-  Information  Strengthening end-to- ICT application  Ministry of Finance \nbusiness  technology for  end trade facilitation by  and e- and Commerce \nbusiness  developing efficient  Governance \nenvironment  interface for single \nimprovement  window clearance \nGovernment-to-  Information  Introducing document  ICT systems  Ministry of \ngovernment  technology for  and/or file management  Communications \nefficient public  system  and Information \nadministration  Technology \nImplementing civil  Ministry of \nservice personnel  Personnel/ Public \nmanagement system  Service \nCommission \nStrengthening data  Ministry of National \ncollection capabilities  Planning and \nand statistical analytical  Economic \ncapabilities; census  Development \nmanagement and \nnational identification \nexercise \n \n13.    The TA will help the Ministry of Science and Technology in reviewing the ICT capacity of \nthe  identified  ICT  academic  institutions  and  implementing  demonstration  projects  in  new \ntechnologies. The activities include (i) reviewing the ICT curriculum by benchmarking against \n ", "4   \nidentified institutions, including assessment of lab facilities, then drawing up an action plan; (ii)  \nstudying ICT certifications offered in the country and identifying additional certification needs; \n(iii) identifying accreditation possibilities; and (iv) studying and recommending action plans with \na view to leveraging those institutions to carry out such innovative activities as creating an \nincubator facility and deploying innovative technologies by implementing demonstration projects \nin academic institutions. \n \n14.   The  academic  institutions  that  will  be  included  in  this  initiative  are (i)  University  of \nComputer  Studies,  Mandalay;  (ii)  Department  of  Information  Technology,  Mandalay \nTechnological  University;  (iii)  University  of  Technology  (Yatanarpon  Cyber  City);  and  (iv) \nDepartment of Information Technology, Yangon Technological University. During the course of \nthe implementation of this TA, steps will be taken to discuss with the regional centers of \nexcellence3 in e-governance and ICT academia to explore collaboration for supporting the e-\ngovernance program.  \n \n15.  The TA will implement demonstration projects in new and emerging technologies in the \nidentified ICT academic institutions. The activities include deployment and transfer of knowledge \nabout how to maintain the technology.  \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n16.   The TA is estimated to cost $1,575,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V); (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund;  and  (iii) \n$500,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  Regional \nCooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office space, office supplies, venues for conferences \nand seminars, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. Disbursements under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.   This TA will proceed on the assumptions, and has mechanisms built in to ensure, that \nthere will be (i) strong ownership by the government agencies, (ii) government commitment to \nre-engineer and adopt simplified business processes, and (iii) adequate project coordination \nactivities by the government. \n \n18.  No adverse social or environmental concerns are foreseen. Since there is no financial \ntransaction  with  government  agencies,  no  issues  related  to  public  financial  management, \nprocurement, and corruption are contemplated. \n \n19.  However, there are a few potential risks anticipated in the areas of (i) possible delays \ndue  to  the  government\u2019s  capacity  to  absorb  e-governance  changes;  (ii)  external  changes, \nincluding political, economic, social, and technological factors; and (iii) possible shortfall in the \ntechnical capacity of the government workforce.  \n                                                \n3 Indicative list of centers of excellence includes institutions such as Seoul National University, National University of \nSingapore, Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, and leading international players in ICT including \nprivate entities. \n ", "5   \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The  Ministry  of  Communications  and  Information  Technology  will  be  the  executing \nagency and implementing agency for the e-governance master plan part of this TA. The Ministry \nof Science and Technology will be the executing and implementing agency for the review of ICT \ncapacity in academic institutions part of the TA. The Ministry of Science and Technology and \nthe Ministry of Communications and Information Technology will provide necessary coordination \nsupport in relation to executing their respective components in the review of ICT capacity in \nacademic institutions and design of the e-governance master plan. ADB will be responsible for \nrecruiting consultants and managing their contracts. In developing the master plan, coordination \nwith development partners in Myanmar will be maintained \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from September 2013 to August 2014. It will \ninclude consultancy services to be provided by an e-governance and ICT education services \nfirm or one with similar qualifications. International consultants and national consultants will be \nengaged on a full-time or intermittent basis to work with staff of the executing and implementing \nagencies assigned to the TA. The program requires employment of varied ICT skills and hence \nADB will expect the prospective consulting firms to propose solution by leveraging its alliances, \nand partnerships. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n22.  Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). In case of difficulties in finding a qualified \nfirm,  individual  selection  will  apply  for  consulting  services.  Procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will use the quality- and \ncost-based selection method while employing an 80:20 quality\u2014cost ratio in order to address the \nneed  for  quality  consultants.  Consultants  will  manage  workshops,  training,  seminars,  and \nconferences under the TA budget. The outputs will be handed over to the executing and/or \nimplementing agency when the TA is completed.  \n \n23.  Implementation  of  the  TA  will  be  monitored  through  monthly  progress  reports  and \nstandard reporting requirements for (i) an inception report (at the end of October 2013), (ii) an \ninterim report (at the end of February 2014), (iii) a draft final report (at the end of June 2014), \nand (iv) a final report (during August 2014). In addition to the reports, a project management unit \nbased in-country and utilizing national consultancy on a continuous or intermittent basis will be \nestablished for the TA\u2019s duration. That unit will help in coordinating with the consultants and \ngovernment agencies. Additionally, status review meetings will be conducted to discuss issues \nand solutions. The facilitation support for such meetings will be coursed through the Foreign \nEconomic Relations Department. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, (ii) \nADB administering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to \nbe financed on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and \nPoverty Reduction Fund, and (iii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of \n$500,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Myanmar for the Design of e-Governance \nMaster Plan and Review of Information and Communication Technology Capacity in Academic \nInstitutions, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n1  DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nEnhanced service  Systematic planning of  Official reports published  Government\u2019s \ndelivery capacity and  information and  or announcements made  commitment to \nefficient public  communication technology  by government agencies  re-engineer and adopt \nmanagement of   (ICT) for provision of  in Myanmar  simplified business \npublic services in the  information and public    processes \ncountry  services to people     \n    Risk \nImproved e-Government  United Nations\u2019  Delays due to \nDevelopment Index.  e-Government  government\u2019s capacity \nBaseline (Year 2012):  Development Database  to absorb e-governance \n0.2703     changes \nTarget year: 2016     \n  \nOutcome      Assumption \nAdoption of an  At least two compliance  Official reports published  Strong ownership by \nintegrated approach  reviews by targeted  or announcements made  government agencies \nin implementing  beneficiary departments by  by government agencies   \ngovernment  2014  in Myanmar \nRisk \napplications and     \nExternal changes, \nonline services to  Measure: Usability,   \nincluding political, \nachieve enhanced  functionality, and   \neconomic, social, and \ncapacity for public  appropriateness of the \ntechnology factors \nservice delivery   design and deployment of \nthe system   \nOutputs      Assumption \n1. e-Governance  At least 10 e-governance  Official reports published  Adequate project \nmaster plan and  action items identified by  or announcements made  coordination activities \naction items  Q2 2014  by government agencies  by the government \ndesigned    in Myanmar \n \n  Prioritization of action   \nRisk \n  items   \nPossible shortfall in the \n     \ngovernment workforce\u2019s \n2.
