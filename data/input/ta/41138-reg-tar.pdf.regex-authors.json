", "I.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  In  2005,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  initiated  the  Clean  Energy  and \nEnvironment Program to foster clean energy development in Asia and the Pacific and to help \naddress climate change and energy security. One of the program\u2019s key components is the \nCarbon Market Initiative (CMI), which provides technical support and up-front financing to clean \nenergy projects with greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation benefits. ADB proposed the CMI in its \n39th Annual Governors\u2019 Meeting in Hyderabad, India, and it was approved by the Board on 20 \nNovember 2006.1\n2.  The CMI is a value-added service extended to clean energy and energy efficiency \nprojects in Asia and the Pacific that are suitable for ADB financing. Through the CMI, ADB can \nutilize the carbon market as a tool and offer technical and financial services to developing \nmember countries (DMCs) in conjunction with regular financing operations. The CMI boosts \nADB\u2019s efforts in promoting energy efficiency, renewable energy, and urban sanitation sector \nprojects where carbon credit revenues can enhance project viability. \n3.  The CMI has three components:  \n(i)  an upfront carbon cofinancing vehicle through the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund \n(APCF);2\n(ii)  technical assistance (TA) for project preparation and implementation through the \ntechnical support facility (TSF); and \n(iii)  marketing support for carbon credits through the credit marketing facility. \n4.  This proposed regional technical assistance (RETA) aims to operationalize the CMI\u2019s \nTSF. The concept paper for this RETA was approved by the vice-president of Knowledge \nManagement and Sustainable Development on 8 June(cid:3) 20073 for $10 million.4(cid:3)In December \n2006, as immediate capacity-building assistance for CMI as part of the TSF, a RETA5 for \nPreparing Clean Energy Projects Eligible for the Clean Development Mechanism, financed by \nthe Japan Special Fund, was(cid:3)approved for $840,000. As of end October 2007, regarding the \nongoing work in preparing clean energy projects, there are already 25 projects (with over \n40 subprojects) and additional 20\u201330 projects requiring support during the coming year. Many \ndonors supporting climate change initiatives in Asia have expressed immediate support and \ncontributions to the TSF. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Access  to  energy  is  essential  to  ensure  sustained  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction. In response to expected high rates of economic growth, the demand for energy in \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006. Carbon Market Initiative: The Asia Pacific Carbon Fund. Manila. \n2\nAPCF became fully operational on 1 May 2007 and now has commitments from Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg, \nPortugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. \n3 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 July 2007. \n4  This TA\u2019s total amount is $4 million due to early contributions expressed by some donors. It is expected that there \nwill be a follow-up RETA in late 2008 or 2009 for another $6 million, with the same design, to be supported by more \ndonors for the remaining years under Kyoto Protocol\u2019s first commitment period (2008\u20132012). \n5  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Preparing Clean Energy Projects Eligible for the Clean Development \nMechanism. Manila. ", "2\nAsia  and  the  Pacific  is  projected  to  increase  significantly  in  the  next  30  years.  However, \ncontinued reliance on fossil fuels as dominant sources of energy will have adverse impacts on \nthe environment. The resultant increasing GHG level in the atmosphere, global warming, and \nclimate change have necessitated a shift toward cleaner energy sources and a low-carbon \nglobal economy to ensure environmental integrity and sustainable growth. In this regard, ADB's \nenergy operations must continue to focus on accelerating the use of clean energy in DMCs. As \nearly as 2000, an energy policy review6 stated that ADB would help DMCs to formulate and \nimplement viable clean energy projects, preferably with private sector involvement, to provide \nelectricity in remote areas and improve the quality of life of the rural poor. In recent years, ADB \nhas further recognized the paramount importance of broadening the application of clean energy \nin DMCs and using existing mechanisms, including the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) \nunder the Kyoto Protocol, which generates extra revenue for DMCs through projects that reduce \nGHG emissions and contribute to climate change mitigation.  \n6.  The  CDM  can  accelerate  clean  energy  projects\u2019  impact  and  natural  resource \nconservation in DMCs while helping them to meet their Kyoto Protocol commitments. Such \nactivities yield both local and global environmental benefits, and the CDM ensures additional \nbenefits to those project developers who opt for cleaner projects and activities. Substantial \nsynergies exist between ADB\u2019s objectives of promoting sustainable growth and clean energy \nprojects and the CDM\u2019s objectives. However, the CDM is a complex process, and most DMCs \nare not equipped to harness CDM\u2019s benefits in a competitive way. Given these circumstances, \nADB can play a critical role in helping DMCs to realize the CDM\u2019s potential.   \n7.  The  proposed  RETA  will  maximize  the  synergy  between  CMI  and  other  ongoing \ninitiatives  and  programs  that  promote  clean  energy  projects,  e.g.,  the  Energy  Efficiency \nInitiative;7 Renewable  Energy,  Energy  Efficiency  and  Climate  Change  Program  (REACH);8\nInnovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative; 9  and  Global  Environment  Facility,  to  enhance  the \ndevelopment effectiveness of ADB\u2019s Clean Energy and Environment Program.(cid:3) For projects \nsupported by operations departments as well as the previously-mentioned schemes, this RETA \nis specifically designed to assist DMCs in completing the necessary Kyoto Protocol procedures \nin order to benefit from the global carbon market. \n8.  ADB has a portfolio of projects that could be designed or retrofitted to become cleaner, \nyielding a significant quantity of carbon credits. A preliminary review of ADB\u2019s project pipeline \nfor the next 3 years reveals that more than 80 projects across various operations departments \nhave or could incorporate components eligible for the CDM. Use of the CDM can translate into \nmultiple benefits for DMCs through an enhanced revenue stream and a greater number of clean \nenergy projects. Operations departments\u2019 staff need support for screening projects for CDM \npotential and in providing assistance to DMCs for further actions in this regard.  \n9.  The proposed RETA operationalizes the TSF to help ADB\u2019s operations departments \nassess the eligibility of ADB-supported projects for receiving carbon revenues. Further, the TSF \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2000. Energy 2000\u2014Review of the Energy Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila.\n7  On 29 July 2005, ADB launched the Energy Efficiency Initiative to expand its investments in clean energy projects \nto at least $1 billion per year starting in 2008. The initiative will assist the technical preparation of energy efficiency \nand renewable energy projects, which may also qualify under the CDM to generate carbon credits. \n8  REACH is an umbrella scheme that combines bilateral funds provided by the governments of Canada, Denmark, \nFinland, and the Netherlands. It began in 2001 and has supported numerous advisory TAs and project preparatory \nTAs across operations departments to promote clean energy projects.   \n9  The multitranche financing facility approved on 25 August 2005 under the Innovation and Efficiency Initiative \nenhances ADB\u2019s assistance to DMCs in the area of clean energy by streamlining subproject financing over multiple \nyears. ", "3\nwill support on going project monitoring during their financing and operational phases to ensure \nthat DMC project developers and sponsors execute projects in accordance with the carbon \nmarket and receive benefits from it. Adequate training and country consultations must also \noccur to ensure a continuous pipeline of candidate projects. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the RETA will be to contribute to low-carbon economic growth in Asia and \nthe Pacific. The outcome of the RETA will be to increase the number of clean energy projects \nwith GHG abatement benefits across Asia and the Pacific. The RETA will (i) enhance the \ntechnical knowledge of project developers and sponsors in DMCs to conceptualize clean energy \nprojects for possible ADB financing, (ii) build the pipeline of clean energy projects suitable for \nADB financing and eligible for the CDM, with special focus on expanding the geographical and \nsectoral coverage of such projects, (iii) oversee the implementation of CDM components during \nthe project execution and operational phases, and (iv) assist with the issuance and transfer of \ncertified emissions reductions (CERs), or \u201ccarbon credits\u201d, including credits contracted with \nCMI\u2019s APCF.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  ADB will carry out the work under the RETA in close coordination with the operations \ndepartments. The RETA activities will include those outlined in the following. \n(i) Capacity development and project identification. The RETA will: \n(a)  Help assess the capacities of DMC governments, agencies, and other \nproject developers to identify and implement CDM-eligible clean energy \nprojects, and conduct targeted CDM technical workshops for countries \nand  regions  with  project  opportunities  in  the  near-  to  mid-term.  The \ntraining  will  focus  on  those  directly  involved  in  the  development  of \nidentified  projects(cid:3) and  staff  from  projects\u2019  executing  agencies.  On  a \nlimited and targeted basis, the TA will assist the capacity building of \ndesignated  national  authorities  (DNAs)10 within  DMCs  with  concrete \nproject proposals. Also, ADB staff knowledge will be enhanced through \nbriefings  provided  by  experts  under  this  TA  and  by  participation  in \ncountry-specific workshops. \n(b)  Help the operations departments undertake a preliminary assessment of \nprojects, and identify projects with GHG abatement potential. The TA will \nalso provide technical inputs into country consultation missions, i.e., in the \ncase of public sector projects, to identify clean energy projects potentially \neligible for the CDM and their inclusion in the country operations business \nplans (COBPs). In addition to hands-on support, the TA team will also \nprovide useful screening tools and briefing notes on lessons learned to \noperations staff and consultants. \n                                                \n10DNAs are responsible for evaluating  whether a proposed CDM project activity contributes to the country\u2019s \nsustainable development. Host country approval by the DNA is required before a project can be validated by \ndesignated operations entities (DOEs, see footnote 11). ", "4\n(ii) Project development and CDM processing support. The RETA will: \n(a)  Assist  in  conducting  preliminary  screening  of  projects\u2019  CDM  eligibility \nunder CDM international rules; performing CDM-related due diligence in \ntandem with the loan preparation process, i.e., most commonly through \nproject preparatory TA for public sector projects; and supporting project \ndevelopers and sponsors in writing project design documents (PDDs) and \nwhen  required,  new  CDM  baseline  and  monitoring  methodologies. \nProjects with financing needs beyond debt and equity support by ADB \noperations departments will be introduced at this stage to CMI\u2019s APCF for \npotential upfront financing against future delivery of CERs. \n(b)   Help project developers obtain host country approval from DNAs and \nsuccessful validation from the designated operational entities11 (DOEs), \nand register them with the CDM Executive Board. \n(iii)  Project implementation and monitoring support. The RETA will: \n(a) Monitor the implementation of project milestones during financing and \nconstruction as specified in the PDD and the specific CDM methodology \nused, as agreed with ADB. \n(b)   Monitor  CDM  data  as  specified  in  the  PDD  and  as  described  in  the \nmonitoring methodology used. \n(c)   Assist the project participants in meeting requirements for verification and \ncertification by the DOEs. Provide technical guidance to meet the DOE \nand the CDM Executive Board requirements. \n(d)   Assist the project participants in meeting requirements for CER issuance \nand transfer.  \nC.  Total Amount and Financing \n12.  The total amount of the TA is estimated at $4.04 million.12 It will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  governments  of  Austria  ($1  million),  Finland  (\u20ac700,000),  and  Luxembourg \n(\u20ac500,000), the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance ($1 million), and the Swiss \nCooperation  Fund  for  Consulting  Services  ($300,000),  and  administered  by  ADB.13 It  will \nsupport equipment,14 training, seminars and workshops, publications and information services, \nCDM validation costs, fees and remuneration for international and national consultants and \ntechnical experts, miscellaneous administration and support costs, and TA consultants and ADB \nresource staff members who participate in country programming and project missions. The \ndetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.\n                                                \n11DOEs  are  third-party  certification  organizations  accredited  by  the  CDM  Executive  Board  to  review  project \ndocuments and validate the project against CDM international rules.  \n12 The exact total amount of the TA will be determined upon transfer and conversion of funds from the governments \nof Finland and Luxembourg.  \n13 Disbursements from the donors will be prorated. \n14The equipment will be procured and disposed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time).  ", "5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB,  as  the  Executing  Agency,  is  expected  to  implement  the  RETA  through  the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department\u2019s Energy, Transport, and Water Division \n(RSID) in close collaboration with the operations departments(cid:3)using the same channels and \ncommunication lines established throughout the implementation of initiatives stated in para. 7. \nADB will also coordinate closely with other project sponsors.(cid:3)To date, no specific DMC has been \nidentified in whose territory any specific activity of the RETA will be undertaken; however, any \nactivity funded by this RETA will only commence in a particular DMC after ADB has received a \nno-objection in writing from the government of the DMC.  \n14.  The RETA will begin in(cid:3)December 2007 and will be carried out over a 36-month period, \nconcluding in December 2010.  \n15.  Two individual international experts (senior carbon market expert and CDM expert) and \ntwo individual national experts (program coordinator and CDM expert) will be engaged for \n24 person-months each over the 36-month period under the direct supervision of RSID. Detailed \nterms of reference are in Appendix 3. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n16.  In addition, the amount of $1.55 million has been budgeted to recruit international and \nnational technical experts on an as-and-when-required basis. These experts will be recruited as \nindividual consultants/consulting firms depending on the requirements of specific assignments \nidentified  during  the  implementation  period.  It  is  envisaged  that  these  experts  will  include \nenvironmental  specialists,  energy  engineers,  CDM  experts,  CDM  technical  advisors,  legal \nexperts, CDM validation experts, and capacity-building experts.15 Detailed terms of reference \nwill be determined once specific projects are identified during the implementation. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n17.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of \u20ac700,000 for the Implementation of the \nTechnical Support Facility under the Carbon Market Initiative, to be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Government of Finland.
