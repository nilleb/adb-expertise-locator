INTRODUCTION \n1.  Public enterprises that provide basic urban services to the populace in Indonesia\u2019s rapidly \nexpanding urban centers are in crisis, failing to keep up with the pace of development in the \ncountry. This is particularly acute in the water supply and sanitation sector where less than 40% of \nthe urban population is connected to piped water systems, and less than 20% countrywide when \nrural water supply is included. Government efforts to improve the situation have produced some \nrelief, but progress has been slower than expected and much remains to be done if the 2015 \ntargets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are to be achieved. \n \n 2.  Discussions  with  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  in  2010 \nresulted in the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor the provision of technical assistance (TA) to develop the capacity of BAPPENAS in the planning \nand development of the water supply and sanitation sector in Indonesia. Through consultation with \nthe major stakeholders in the sector and supported by expert consultants, BAPPENAS would \nprepare a realistic and harmonized road map and project pipeline for rural and urban water supply \nand sanitation in Indonesia. The design and monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Indonesia is urbanizing rapidly, but most urban public enterprises, tasked to provide basic \nservices to urban dwellers, are in crisis. Government-owned water supply enterprises (PDAMs) \nhave connected only about 39% of the urban population to piped water supply, and less than 20% \nof the population is connected countrywide. Investment in new piped water infrastructure has come \nto a standstill, and many PDAMs and local governments have loan arrears with the central Ministry \nof Finance. In 2006, the ministry issued new regulation to restructure the loan arrears of PDAMs. \nThe program called for writing off 70% of PDAM debt, while 30% was restructured. To qualify, \nPDAMs needed to put in place a valid business plan, including a plan to raise tariffs to full-cost \nrecovery, and appoint a qualified professional to run their operations. Of more than 300 PDAMs, \nonly 90 submitted business plans, of which only 30 were of acceptable standard and are awaiting \napproval.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  has  been  assisting \n16 PDAMs (of the 30 with acceptable proposals) in preparing their business plans. \n \n4.  In  2009,  the  central  government  announced  that  it  would  prioritize  a  program  for \naccelerating the connection of 10 million households to piped water supply. The government is \nalso actively promoting improvement of sanitation countrywide, and a number of related donor-\nsupported programs have been completed or are ongoing, including the completed ADB-financed \nTA for Preparing the Metropolitan Sanitation Management and Health Project2 and the recently \napproved loan;3 the Environmental Services Program (phases 1 and 2) financed by the United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID); and the Water and Sanitation Program4-\nmanaged Indonesia Sanitation Sector Development Program. In addition, new initiatives\u2014such as \nthe capacity development TA to support water operators\u2019 partnerships in Indonesia,5 funded by \n                                                \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 April 2011. \n2   ADB. 2006.

Development of capacity through the sharing of knowledge and experience is essential for \nthe PDAMs and PDPALs to make progress and work toward meeting MDG 7, target 10, which calls \nfor halving, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and \nsanitation. The adoption of best practices from around the region based on recent experience will \nbe key to the development of water supply and sanitation in Indonesia. Improving the capacity of \nBAPPENAS for water supply and sanitation will provide the basis for better national planning in the \nsector, and for the development of a road map and pipeline of priority interventions and projects \nthat will contribute to achieving tangible results toward meeting the MDGs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  that  planning  and  implementation  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation services in Indonesia are improved. Coverage of urban and rural water supply and \nsanitation is increased in line with national and MDG targets. Baselines will be established for 2011 \nand MDGs are the target for 2015 and onward.  \n \n7.  The outcome will be stronger technical and planning capacity of BAPPENAS in water \nsupply  and  sanitation.  The  preparation  of  a  high-quality  sector  strategy  and  road  map,  the \ndevelopment of an agreed project pipeline and improved portfolio, and endorsement of these \nproducts by the Government of Indonesia and major stakeholders may help to ensure performance \nin the sector against MDG targets. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will support BAPPENAS in reviewing and assessing the water supply and sanitation \nsector; defining key issues and bottlenecks and how to overcome these; developing a sector road \nmap; and contributing to the development of a stronger project pipeline for urban and rural water \nsupply and sanitation projects, all of which will help achieve MDG targets. The sector road map will \nalso  discuss  potential  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  along  with  gender  strategy  and \neducation, especially given the important role that women can play in ensuring household hygiene \nonce water and sanitation are provided. \n  \n9.  BAPPENAS, as the executing agency, will establish stronger coordination and collaboration \nin water supply and sanitation with the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the \nNational Water Supply Association, PDAMs and PDPALs and local governments. As the major \ngovernment entities in the sector responsible for implementation and service delivery, their input \nand cooperation will be vital for the preparation of a realistic and sustainable road map and project \npipeline. In addition, collaboration with other development partners involved in the sector\u2014such as \nAusAID, Japan International Cooperation Agency, USAID, and the World Bank\u2014is essential in \nensuring that a harmonized approach to water supply and sanitation initiatives is maintained and \nthe  results  of  their  ongoing  projects  or  programs  are  incorporated  into  the  overall  strategy \nproposed. \n \n10.  The operational and financial performance of PDAMs, PDPALs, and local governments is \ncrucial for the long-term sustainability of the water supply and sanitation sector. Therefore, an \n ", "3 \n \noutline assessment will be undertaken to illustrate the financial and economic benefits that can be \nachieved through greater autonomy, the setting of appropriate tariff levels, and more efficient billing \nand revenue collection; and how better financial control relates to and can complement operational \nimprovements. This will bolster the government in setting economic criteria for the development, \nselection, and sequencing of the water supply and sanitation project pipeline.  \n \n11.  To aid the much-needed development of the PDAMs and PDPALs, the TA will include \nworkshops and seminars to introduce best practices from around the region, including case studies \non how similar situations have been overcome in neighboring countries and the lessons that could \nbe successfully applied to Indonesia. Such events will also provide an opportunity to consult and \nliaise  with  national  and  local  government  agencies,  with  development  partners,  and \nrepresentatives of civil society to ensure that experiences and knowledge are shared effectively \namong the main stakeholders. The workshops will be scheduled to coincide with the completion of \nmajor project achievements, i.e., (i) the sector strategy and road map, and (ii) the proposed project \npipeline. Feedback from the workshops will be incorporated into succeeding documents, up to the \nfinal report and knowledge products. \n \n12.  The  project  team  will  prepare  a  knowledge  and  communications  plan  as  well  as  two \nknowledge products (one rural, one urban) with peer review by the ADB Institute and/or Korea \nWater Resources Corporation and ADB units such as the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment.  The  subject  matter  for  the  knowledge  products  will  be  determined  during \nimplementation,  based  on  actual  need  and  after  discussions  with  BAPPENAS,  PDAMs,  and \nPDPALs, the National Water Supply Association, and other major stakeholders. The TA will also \nprepare an ADB publication, based on the findings of the TA and the sector road map for Indonesia. \n \n13.  The TA will help promote long-term knowledge partnerships, particularly between utilities, \nthat will continue after TA completion, such as those developed under the AusAID-funded program \n(para.  14).  To  assist  in  the  knowledge  development  activities  and  in  the  dissemination  of \nknowledge and experience, the project team will collaborate with ADB\u2019s Water Community of \nPractice and the ADB Institute to develop the workshops to be implemented by ADB. Opportunities \nfor synergies with ADB's proposed TA for Promoting an Asia-Pacific Wastewater Management \nRevolution6 will also be investigated, as will opportunities to contribute to and gain from ongoing \nADB-supported water supply and sanitation initiatives in Indonesia and the region. \n \n14.  Since January 2011, ADB has been implementing the TA Supporting Water Operators\u2019 \nPartnerships in Indonesia where twinning partnerships are established between an international \nexpert  utility  and  a  recipient  PDAM.  The  TA  uses  AusAID  funding  to  provide  peer-to-peer \nknowledge exchange based on the successful model established under the regional TA Supporting \nWater Operators\u2019 Partnerships in Asia,7 under which 19 partnerships have been established since \n2007. Under the WOPs program in Indonesia, seven international twinning partnerships will be \nestablished, five in water supply and two in sanitation. A domestic twinning program will also be \npiloted with at least two partnerships. Feedback from the partnerships in Indonesia will inform this \nTA and the establishment of the road map. USAID's ECO-Asia program is implementing a similar \nWOPs program, including twinning in Indonesia, and has, together with ADB and the International \nWater Association, established the WaterLinks8 network to coordinate WOPs in Asia. This will be \nanother source of information for the project team. \n                                                \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n6m  Reemgbioenrasl,  cBaopaacrdity o df eDvierleocptmoresn,t  MTAa neaxpgeecmteedn tto,  ober  satpapffr,o vaendd  inm 2a0y1 b1.e  preliminary in nature.  \n7  ADB. 2007.

A second \nforum was held at ADB headquarters in May 2010, and the third forum will be held in Kuala Lumpur in November \n2011. The WaterLinks secretariat is currently being registered as a non-profit organization in Metro Manila.  \n ", "4 \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The \nTA  will  be  used  to  pay  for  consultants,  travel  costs,  training,  and  workshops,  as  well  as \ndevelopment and dissemination of knowledge products. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, administrative services as needed, \nand other in-kind contributions. See Appendix 2 for details of the cost estimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Directorate General of Housing and Settlements of BAPPENAS will be the executing \nagency and the TA will be implemented over 12 months, starting in November 2011. Consultants \nwill assist the executing agency in preparing (i) sector studies and road map reports, (ii) relevant \nsections of project preparation documentation, (iii) brief monthly progress reports, and (iv) other \nreports as required. To best assist the executing agency, the consultants will be based at the \noffices of BAPPENAS in Jakarta, but will spend approximately 40% of their input time at the \nIndonesia Resident Mission in Jakarta to liaise with ADB's project officer and keep ADB updated \non developments. \n \n17.  The TA will require about 25 person-months of consulting services (14 international person-\nmonths  and  11  national).  Given  the  limited  budget,  intermittent  inputs,  and  the  need  to  be \nseconded to BAPPENAS, it is important to have a flexible TA team that can be responsive to the \ndemands  of the TA.  Consultants  will  therefore  be  recruited  individually. The  outline terms  of \nreference are in Appendix 3. ADB will recruit consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n18.  The executing agency will provide the consultants with suitable office space; a sufficient \nnumber of standard desks, chairs, shelves, and closets; lighting; electricity; air conditioning; and \naccess to phone lines. The consultants will cover the cost of phone services and internet access, \nand the executing agency will cover electricity costs. The consultants will be given free access to \nrelevant government information, studies, reports, and data as applicable. \n \n19.  Formal  reporting  will  be  semiannual  to  the  Southeast  Asia  Department.  Wider \ncommunication  will  be  provided  through  ADB's  Water  Community  of  Practice  and  the \ndissemination of information through the ADB website.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government of \nIndonesia to  be financed  on  a grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge \nPartnership Fund for the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Development Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1           5 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets \nData Sources and  Assumptions and \nand Indicators with \nReporting Mechanisms  Risks \nDesign Summary  Baselines \nImpact      Assumptions \nPlanning and  Coverage of urban and  Government demographic,  The government adopts \nimplementation of water  rural water supply and  economic, and water  and implements road map \nsupply and sanitation  sanitation is increased in  supply and sanitation  and project pipeline in a \nservices in Indonesia are  line with national and MDG  statistics  timely manner \nimproved  targets.

Introduction \n \n1.  Consultant support is required to assist Indonesia's National Development Planning Agency \n(BAPPENAS) in the development of a program for urban and rural water supply and sanitation, \nincluding sector policy dialogue with the government, the donor community, and other stakeholders, \nand processing of loan and technical assistance (TA) projects. There should be an emphasis on \nbest  practices from  around  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region,  and  stakeholder  participation  will  be \nensured through workshops and seminars, where knowledge and experience will be shared. \n \n2.  The Directorate General of Housing and Settlements of BAPPENAS will be the executing \nagency for this TA, which is administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). To ensure \neffective assistance to the executing agency, the international and local consultants will be based \nat  the  offices  of  BAPPENAS  in  Jakarta.  However,  the  consultants  will  be  required  to spend \napproximately 40% of their input time (2 days per week on average) at the Indonesia Resident \nMission in Jakarta to (i) work and liaise directly with the ADB project officer, (ii) ensure good \ncoordination with other ADB initiatives, and (iii) keep ADB informed of all developments in a timely \nmanner. \n \n3.  During  implementation  of  the  TA  the  consultants  shall  take  into  consideration  ADB\u2019s \nongoing initiatives in Indonesia and coordinate with the team that is undertaking the country sector \nassessment, strategy, and road map, which will be ongoing when the TA commences. Account \nmust be taken of other existing sector road maps and initiatives. \n \n4.  The consultants should also consider the content of the sector assistance performance \nevaluation for Indonesia (and perhaps that of other countries), which was undertaken by ADB\u2019s \nIndependent Evaluation Department. This may identify issues and/or lessons that could enrich the \nformulation of the sector road map. Should the sector road map proceed to the level of spatial \nplanning, sociocultural aspects and environmental sensitivity will be important considerations to \ntake into account, so as to minimize the \"NIMBY\u201d (not in my backyard) syndrome commonly \nencountered in this sector. \n \nB.  Team  Leader  and  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Specialist  (international, \n10 person-months, intermittent) \n \n5.
