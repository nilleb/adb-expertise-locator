INTRODUCTION\n1. At the turn of the 21st century, world financial markets witnessed major transformation\nand turbulence. In response, the banking industry, stock exchanges, and corporate sectors\nacross the world are consolidating, and seeking mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures. 1 This\ntrend has gained momentum to exploit the advantages of globalization and the new international\neconomy  emerging  from  technological  innovation  and  financial  engineering.  These\ndevelopments  are  expected  to  enhance  the  competitive  edge  of  developed  markets  as\nconsolidation generates cost efficiency, and revenue enhancements in cross-border business\nand alliances. Asian financial markets now need to regain their strength and position lost during\nthe 1997 financial crisis and launch efforts to compete effectively in a changing environment.\nThis regional technical assistance (TA)2 aims to encourage development of a robust and well-\ndiversified Asian financial system based on strong regulatory frameworks, adoption of financial\nand  technological  innovations,  and  sound  business  practices.  The  TA  will  examine  Asian\nfinancial markets and their structural transformation in the postcrisis period, and the growing\ninternal and external challenges they face. Based on this analysis, the TA will develop a\nstrategy  and  action  plan  to  promote  regional  integration  and  cooperation,  and  help  Asian\nfinancial  markets  strengthen  their  financial  regulation  in  accordance  with  principles  and\nguidelines stipulated by the standard setting bodies (SSBs).3 The Asian Development Bank\n(ADB), given its regional mandate, is uniquely positioned to (i) facilitate strategic thinking on\ndeveloping Asia\u2019s financial markets, and (ii) promote strengthening of their financial market\nregulation and supervision. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The financial markets have faced unprecedented turmoil with the rising frequency and\nseverity of crisis episodes including the European monetary crisis of 1992-1993, the Mexican\ncrisis of 1994, the 1997 East Asian crisis, and the 1998 Russian Federation and Brazilian crises.\nThese crises (which have been extensively studied) endangered global financial stability and\nexacted high economic, financial, and social tolls. Within the region, although the People's\nRepublic of China (PRC) was to an extent less affected by the regional crisis due its strict\ncapital  account  controls,  its  restrictive  domestic  policies  magnified  banking  distress  and\nrevealed the inherent vulnerability of the financial sector in a liberalizing environment. PRC\ncarried out a major recapitalization of state commercial banks and transferred nonperforming\nportfolios to the newly created asset management companies for debt resolution. In terms of\nfinancial sector adjustment needed to overcome the crises, five Asian economies4 were among\nthe most affected. Meanwhile, PRC problems emanate from its own domestic macroeconomic\nand financial policies. Overall, in these six economies nonperforming bank portfolios ranged\nfrom 30 to 80 percent, requiring an aggregate recapitalization of about $290.0 billion (16 percent\nof their combined gross domestic products). Stock prices (except in the PRC) remain below\nprecrisis levels. The potency, virulence, and negative effects of the crises went beyond regional\nboundaries, altered investor perceptions, and forced a reexamination of financial and corporate\nbusiness structures and markets.\n3. Responding to the internal challenges during the postcrisis period, Asia has taken steps,\nalbeit at a slower pace, to restructure and transform financial markets. For instance, in the five\ncrisis-affected  Asian  economies,  consolidation  occurred  as  364  banks  and  other  financial\ninstitutions closed, and 111 banks and financial institutions merged. With the easing of entry\n                                                          \n1  Group of Ten. 2001. Report on Consolidation of the Financial Sector. http://www.bis.org/publ/gteno5.htm\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in March 2001.\n3 Refers primarily to the Bank of International Settlements, International Organization of Securities Commissions,\nInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors, and International Accounting Association.\n4  Refers to Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand.", "2\nrestrictions,  foreign  financial  institutions  have acquired all, or part, of 18 commercial banks in\nthe Republic of Korea, Philippines, and Thailand. The PRC is also changing its regulatory\nframework to allow foreign joint ventures and strategic partners in the insurance industry and\nfunds management. Another response during the postcrisis period has been the positioning of\nsecurities regulators across Asia to better enforce market regulations and surveillance, while\nencouraging  market  participants  to  strengthen  information  disclosure,  and  accounting  and\nauditing standards.\n4. The Asian crisis underscored the dangers of (i) a high dependence on bank-based\nfinancing  and  family-based  conglomerates,  (ii)  undercapitalized  financial  institutions,  and\n(iii) weak transparency and enforcement of regulations. These distortions prevented the markets\nfrom properly pricing risks. As a result, firms and banks took excessive risk without adequate\nhedging or safeguards. The public issue of equity securities and corporate bonds to help risk\nmitigation and diversification remains low. Regulatory and tax constraints, weaknesses of the\nsettlement systems, and the absence of liquidity support systems prohibit issuance and trading\nof debt to yield market-determined benchmarks. ADB, through its operational programs, is\naddressing  these  structural  constraints  with  a  view  to  reduce  the  fragility  and  systemic\nvulnerability of Asian markets.\n5. Besides the internal challenges, Asian financial markets face a number of external\nchallenges. These include growing globalization and integration, rapid proliferation of the new\ninternational  economy,  information  technology  (IT),  financial  innovations  including\nreengineering,  and  trade  and  financial  linkages,  and  growing  interdependence.  Taking\nadvantage of these, the developed financial markets are consolidating and altering their ways of\ndoing business through mergers and acquisitions. This is helping them realize economies of\nscale,  operating  efficiencies,  revenue  enhancements,  sophisticated  risk  management,\ndiversification and new technology. During the 1990s, there was a strong wave of financial\nrestructuring in 13 developed markets. Bank acquisitions alone accounted for 70 percent of the\nvalue of merger transactions, and the United States accounted for 55 percent of these. As a\nconsequence, the emerging financial industry is more concentrated in terms of deposit base,\nraising concerns about systemic risk and the possibility of large financial conglomerates stifling\ncompetition. Although most of the financial sector consolidation in developed markets is industry\ndriven, it has been facilitated by the removal of important legal and regulatory barriers to\nindustry consolidation.\n6. Parallel to these trends, in Europe the introduction of the euro and expectations for\neventual harmonization of regulations, supervision, and market surveillance has accelerated\nfinancial market integration and encouraged cross-border activity. Responding to the pressures\ncreated by electronic communications networks, alternate trading systems, and the need to\nreduce  transaction  costs,  international  capital  markets  are  also  beginning  to  consolidate.\nBesides the establishment of Euronext involving merger of the stock exchanges of Amsterdam,\nBrussels, Madrid, Paris, and Zurich, a number of other exchanges are exploring options for\nalliances with other partners. In Asia, Hong Kong, China and Singapore have created holding\ncompanies  to  combine  clearing,  settlement,  and  depository  functions,  while  seeking  to\ndemutualize  their  exchanges  and  form  possible  alliances  with  the  Nasdaq.  Other  smaller\nexchanges are also examining how best to transform their stock markets into more competitive,\nliquid, and efficient operations.\n7. To benefit from the globalization, integration, and linkages, the Group of 7 (G7)5 leaders\nand finance ministers have mandated international financial institutions and other forums to\nstrengthen the international financial system. In October 1998, G7-sponsored working groups\n                                                          \n5 The G7 countries include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States.", "3\nadvocated enhancement of transparency and accountability,  strengthening  of  financial\nsystems,  and  resolution  of  international  financial  crises.  Adopting  these  recommendations,\nnotable progress has been made by\n(i)  the International Monetary Fund to strengthen economic surveillance and launch\nfinancial sector assessment programs;\n(ii)  SSBs that have revised the 1988 capital accord for internationally active banks,\nand  developed  guidelines  and  principles  for  securities  markets,  accounting,\ninsurance,  settlement  and  payments,  corporate  governance,  and  insolvency,\namong other areas;\n(iii)  the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), established by the G7 in February 2000 to\npromote principles and guidelines for capital flows, offshore financial centers,\ndeposit insurance, and highly leveraged institutions; and\n(iv)  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which developed the guiding principles\nfor promoting freer and stable capital flows, corporate governance, and credit\nratings,  and  is  building  the  capacity  of  financial  regulators  and  supervisors\nthrough ADB-financed training programs.\n8. The international community has enhanced understanding of the causes and lessons\nlearned from the Asian crisis, and developed economic surveillance and international financial\nstandards. Simultaneously, Asian economies have launched reforms to restore macroeconomic\nstability  and  restructure  the  financial  sector.  However,  Asia\u2019s  financial  markets  remain\nfragmented and vulnerable, lack diversification, continue to maintain a high dependence on\nbank-based  financing,  and  have  yet  to  effectively  exploit  their  high  saving  rate  to  meet\ninvestment needs and adopt new technology and innovations. Progress is slow in enforcing\ninternational financial standards and developing crisis prevention and mitigation capacities.\nMoreover,  coordination  within  the  region  to  explore  benefits  of  regional  consolidation,\nintegration, and alliances among stock exchanges to improve their competitive position has\nbeen limited, even as expansion in electronic communication networks, alternative training\nsystems, and capital market integration proceeds. Asian financial markets need to critically\ndefine their market and niche, open the financial services industry in the next 5-10 years in line\nwith World Trade Organization requirements, and meet the competition and risks associated\nwith financial consolidation and integration in developed financial markets.\n9. ADB, given its mandate and unique position in the region, has the potential to help\nDMCs  address  these  concerns  and  challenges,  by  developing  appropriate  strategies  and\napproaches to modernize and diversify the financial services industry. This TA will draw on the\nfindings and recommendations of past regional TAs in the financial sector. These TAs have (i)\nassessed pre-1997 profiles of financial markets and the causes and effects of the currency and\nfinancial crises from a macroeconomic perspective;6 (ii) launched regional studies of domestic\nbond markets, corporate governance, and pension systems;7 (iii) provided policy support to\n                                                          \n6 TA 5776-REG: Financial Markets in Asia: An Engine of Growth or a Source of Instability?, for $150,000, approved\non 20 February 1998, and TA 5770-REG: Study of Financial Markets in Selected Member Countries, for $973,000,\napproved on 6 January 1998.\n7  TA  5809-REG: Study on the Development of Government Bond Markets in Selected Developing Member\nCountries, for $740,000, approved on 8 October 1998; TA 5847-REG: APEC Growth Recovery Initiatives, for\n$2,150,000, approved on 2 June 1999, and TA 5763-REG: Collaborative Initiatives for Financial and Capital Market\nDevelopment, for $400,000, approved on 22 December 1997.", "4\ndevelop  a  regulatory  framework  for  selected crisis-affected  economies;8  (iv)  conducted  a\ndiagnostic review of existing accounting and auditing support and standards in the region;9 and\n(v) sponsored seminars to enhance understanding in financial restructuring including debt-\nequity swaps.10 Drawing on the findings of these and other international studies, the current TA\nwill examine the financial markets as they have evolved in the postcrisis period. The TA will also\nanalyze the internal and external policy challenges facing the region, and determine what steps\nare needed to position the financial markets to better serve the region's requirements.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n10. The TA aims to encourage development of robust and well-diversified financial systems\nin Asia, based on strong regulatory frameworks, and adoption of financial and technological\ninnovations and sound business practices. The TA will examine Asian financial markets, their\nstructural transformation in the postcrisis period, the growing internal and external challenges\nthey face, and how these impact on poverty. Based on this analysis, the TA will develop a\nstrategy and action plan to promote regional integration and cooperation, with the objective of\nstrengthening and consolidating these financial markets to benefit from recent developments in\nthe new international economy outlined in para. 5. In addition, the TA will help Asian financial\nmarkets  strengthen  financial  regulation  in  line  with  international  standards.  The  study  will\nexamine the broad trends in developed and Asian financial markets at large, and will include\nmore in-depth analysis of the five crisis-affected East Asian countries and PRC where financial\nmarkets have recently witnessed significant structural transformation and where the challenges\nto be met from globalization of the financial sector are imminent.\nB. Scope\n11. The TA will conduct an Asian financial markets study to\n(i)   assess the structural transformation of Asian markets with focus on (a) structural\nchanges in the financial services industry and developments in financing mix,\nand  business  practices  in  the  postcrisis  period;  (b) size  and  health  of  main\nsegments  of  the  financial  industry;  (c)  extent,  level,  and  pros  and  cons  of\nconsolidation  versus  specialization  and/or  universal  banking;  (d)  changes  in\nownership and conglomerate structures in different segments of the financial\nservices industry; (e) transformation and consolidation in the nonbank industry\nwith emphasis on developments in the securities market; and (f) developments to\nstrengthen regulations and supervisory oversight of financial markets;\n(ii)   examine  the  internal  and  external  challenges  facing  Asian  financial  markets\nincluding growing competition and integration prompted by consolidation and\ntechnological advancements in developed financial markets;\n(iii)   examine  the  state  of  prudential  regulations,  and  the  complexities  that  the\nbanking, insurance, and securities markets face in meeting the standards set by\n                                                          \n8  TA 5765-REG: Banking, Capital Market, and International Competitiveness Reforms in Response to Currency\nTurmoil, for $2,625,150, approved on 22 December 1997.\n9  TA 5877-REG: Strengthening Financial Management and Governance in Selected Developing Member Countries,\nfor $400,000, approved on 14 December 1999.\n10TA 5845-REG: Regional Seminar on Options for Financial Restructuring, for $50,000, approved on 25 May 1999.", "5\nthe  SSBs,  and  the  pros  and cons  of  different  regulatory  structures  (i.e.,\nsingle versus integrated regulatory structures); and\n(iv)   based on the diagnostic review, develop a strategy and an action plan for Asian\nfinancial  markets  to  provide  broader  policy  and  regulatory  direction  at  the\nregional level; recommend areas for regional integration and cooperation; and\n(a) propose improvements for coordination at the regulators' level; (b) assess\nprospects for regional harmonization of rules, regulations, and capital market\nintegration; and (c) suggest steps to be taken nationally and regionally to benefit\nfrom  financial  innovations,  reengineering,  and  growing  globalization  and\ninterdependence.\n12. As part of this effort, the TA will support in collaboration with FSF, SSBs, and the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation, the promotion of international financial standards11 and their\nassessment and enforcement. In particular, ADB and FSF will provide a forum, Implementation\nof International Financial Standards in Asia, at ADB's 34th Annual Meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii,\nand other forums in the region. These forums will involve FSF, SSBs, and national regulators to\nenhance implementation of standards and explore ways to encourage the public and private\nsectors to adopt standards in their risk assessments, and reflect this in product pricing, and\nallocation of credit and investment. The forum discussions will help prioritize the key areas of\nfinancial sector reform and restructuring in the region, under the proposed study.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 consisting entirely of foreign exchange. The\nTA will be funded on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program. The TA will finance the\nservices of international (20 person-months) and domestic (16 person-months) consulting. The\nconsultants will include financial sector, banking, and capital market specialists. The TA budget\nincludes $80,000 to finance the costs of international forums organized in collaboration with FSF\nand other international agencies, and workshops to discuss the outline and findings of the Asian\nfinancial markets study. Detailed cost estimates are presented in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n14. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA implementation arrangements and\nallocation of total person-months to the various areas of expertise will be kept flexible depending\non the coverage of countries and topics. All of the consultants will be recruited on an individual\nbasis  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other\narrangements acceptable to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of\nreference for the consultants are provided in Appendix 3. The TA will commence in May 2001\nwith the launching of the FSF-ADB forum to promote the international financial standards (para.\n12) followed by initiation of the work for the study in August 2001. The TA will be completed by\nDecember 2002. The Financial Sector and Industry Division (East) will administer and supervise\nthe TA.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n15.
