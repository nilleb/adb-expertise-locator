INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  strongly  committed  to  supporting  progress \ntoward  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  which  are  an  important  platform  for \nrenewed development cooperation during 2016\u20132030 adopted by member states at the United \nNations  Sustainable  Development  Summit  in  September  2015.1 The  Addis  Ababa  Action \nAgenda, Paris climate agreement, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, \n2015\u20132030 reinforce support for the SDGs.2 Together, they will influence national policies and \nbudgets, partnerships with the private sector and civil society, and development cooperation \nover a 15-year span. \n \n2.  The SDGs build on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), with a broader focus \nthat includes economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental responsibility in developing \nand developed countries. For the first time, the global aim has extended to ending poverty in all \nforms  everywhere,  instead  of  just  reducing  it  by  half  in  developing  countries.  Tackling \ninequalities in realizing opportunities and safeguarding the environment while promoting growth \nis now fully embedded in the SDGs. Higher SDG ambitions offer both new opportunities and \ndifficult trade-offs that have to be negotiated through new approaches to development. However, \nas noted in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, financing for development (FFD) has lagged \nbehind the SDG aspirations. ADB, together with the other multilateral development banks, has \ncommitted to the provision of increased financial resources as well as technical assistance (TA) \nand policy advice in support of the new global development agenda.3 \n \n3.  Existing ADB TA support for the MDGs has been active since 2004, and will end on 31 \nDecember 2016. It is implemented through a three-phased allocation of $2.825 million,4 and its \nfocus has shifted to the SDGs during 2015\u20132016. ADB and its developing member countries \n(DMCs) would benefit from new TA with a strengthened focus on the SDGs, which builds on \nexperience with the MDGs and lessons from the MDG TA.5 This TA aims to support SDG \nprogress in Asia and the Pacific, complement the efforts of other development partners, and \nhelp ADB prepare engagements in support of the SDGs. \n \n4.  A proposal for this TA, with initial budget of $1,000,000 from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF-V), was presented to Heads of Departments on 12 November 2015 as part \nof the 2016 corporate priority TA program. The budget was increased to $1,400,000 to fund \nexpanded TA activities.6 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n                                                \n1  United  Nations  (UN)  General  Assembly.  2015.  Transforming  our  world:  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable \nDevelopment. New York (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld). \n2  2015 saw three major interlinked global events for development cooperation: (i) the Third International Conference \non Financing for Development, held 13\u201316 July in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; (ii) the UN Sustainable Development \nSummit 2015, held 25\u201327 September in New York; and (iii) the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held  30 November\u221211 December 2015 in Paris, \nFrance. In addition, 2015 started with the adoption of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, 2015\u2013\n2030 at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction on 18 March in Sendai, Japan. \n3  African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nEuropean Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank \nGroup. 2015.

Regional: Supporting the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in the Asia and Pacific Region, \nPhase III. http://www.adb.org/projects/39359-012/main#project-pds \n5  Key  lessons include  (i)  incorporating the  significantly different  nature  of the  SDGs (which  integrate social, \neconomic, and environmental dimensions) from the MDGs, which were primarily oriented at poverty; and (ii) \nstrengthening the dissemination of knowledge outputs, both internally and externally. \n6  The concept paper\u2019s title, Support for Post 2015 International Development Goals, has been updated to Agenda \n2030:  Supporting  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  through  Strategic  Partnerships  and  Preparedness  to \nincorporate the final name of the new goals. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on 3 June 2016. \n ", " 2 \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  With the conclusion of the MDG TA, it is necessary to budget resources for ADB\u2019s \nstrategic external engagements and internal measures to (i) enhance ADB collaboration with \npartners  on  SDG  tracking, contribute  to  assessing  implementation  challenges,  and  identify \nopportunities presented by the SDGs; and (ii) develop a cohesive ADB response to the SDGs, \nincluding identifying potential directions and business prospects to better support ADB DMCs. \n \n6.  The proposed TA responds to two types of issues: (i) challenges critical to sustainable \ndevelopment, with a diagnosis of strategic bottlenecks to SDG progress; and (ii) complexities in \ntracking and reporting on SDG progress (the SDGs include new areas and interlinking goals). \nShared perspectives on the challenges faced by DMCs, especially those that cut across several \nSDGs, and regular updates on progress will be critical for future development cooperation. \n \n7.  The TA will support Agenda 2030 overall, complementing a more detailed focus on \nindividual goals that can be better provided by relevant thematic and sector groups. Externally, \nthis TA will (i) support shared tracking (in combination with development partners) of overall \nSDG progress in the region; (ii) facilitate collaboration on SDG-related reports, technical papers, \nand studies relevant to varied country contexts; and (iii) support policy dialogues, consultations, \nand advocacy through multi-stakeholder platforms. This will systematically provide ADB insights \ninto the changing development context of the SDGs, and contribute to monitoring the ongoing \nrelevance of ADB operations. Internally, the TA will assist in building ADB\u2019s corporate response \nto the SDGs. It will help to better reflect the SDGs in ADB\u2019s strategic directions, operations, and \nresults reporting, and respond to new business opportunities that are tailored to meet the \nspecific circumstances of different DMCs. Thus, the TA will support the overall ADB response to \nAgenda 2030 through strategic partnerships and strengthened preparedness. \n \n8.  Three  megatrends  in  Asia  require  consideration:  (i)  exponential  urbanization; \n(ii) demographic change, both from changing birth and death rates and from enormous human \nmobility;  and  (iii)  a  huge  rise  in  connectedness  resulting  from  increased  cross-border \nmovements of money, goods, services, ideas, and people. These trends present challenges and \nopportunities. The region has a large proportion of the world\u2019s population that faces deprivation \non a number of income and non-income measures, with the largest numbers found in middle-\nincome countries. Climate change is a global concern that has the potential to reverse hard-won \ngains. ADB recognizes that while robust growth remains important for the SDGs, countries and \npartners must increase their focus on inclusion and the environment, leverage new opportunities, \nand ease the trade-offs that these actions may present. \n \n9.  There are critical bottlenecks (such as gaps in infrastructure services and FFD) that \nconstrain overall SDG progress. Infrastructure investments are inherently long-term and not \neasily reversed, and thus require a well-considered approach. Access to quality infrastructure \nservices affects both overall growth and the ability of the poor to realize opportunities, while \nshaping a society\u2019s potential to enjoy a cleaner environment and a fair sharing of benefits \nacross generations. Durability and resilience are important factors, as these public assets are \nexpected to have long life spans. \n \n10.  The increased ambition of Agenda 2030 in combination with changes in aid architecture \nrequires  new  approaches  to  the  mobilization  of  funds  from  all  sources,  as  the  share  of \n ", "3  \nnontraditional  sources  is  expanding.7 While  the  fragmentation  of  aid  sources  will  require \nmanagement, it increases the choices available to DMCs, and may enable better alignment with \nnational priorities. The ability of many DMCs to benefit from the changing finance landscape has \nbeen restricted by limited financial markets and the capacity of DMCs to access, manage, and \nabsorb  funds  for  strategic  applications.  Official  development  assistance  will  be  far  from \nadequate, although it has particular value in terms of its direct contribution to development. \nClimate funds will be a growing source of funding. A shift from development finance to wider \nFFD will provide cofinancing openings for ADB to support country-specific opportunities to \naccess and use domestic and international finance options from both public and private sources. \n \n11.  There is a growing need to support (i) progressive improvements on SDG indicators, \nagreed definitions, and disaggregation; (ii) shared tracking of SDG challenges and progress; \nand  (iii)  improved  communication. The  United  Nations  (UN)  Statistical  Commission\u2019s  Inter-\nagency Expert Group on SDG Indicators has finalized a global set of 230 indicators to monitor \nthe  169  targets  under  the  17  SDGs.8 Discussions  are  underway  to  harmonize  the  SDG \nindicators with those for monitoring the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, while consensus needs to \nbe  reached  regarding  indicators  for  private  sector  contributions.  New  indicators  to  track \nadditional  dimensions  of  economic,  social,  and  environmental  conditions  in  a  globally \ncomparable  way  have  increased  demands  on  official  statistical  systems,  straining  national \ncapacities.  A  long-term  view  requires  covering  all  targets  meaningfully  rather  than  limiting \nmonitoring to those indicators with sound current methodologies and broad country coverage. \nThe global aim is to improve data in stages, with contributions by regional partners. \n \n12.  UN member states have pledged to leave no one behind (i.e., the SDGs must reach and \nbenefit everyone regardless of ethnicity, gender, geography, disability, race or other status), \nwhich will require serious attention to data disaggregation to counter disparities. Information on \nsystemically disadvantaged population groups and/or locations and better disaggregation of \ndata by gender are important. For countries in Asia and the Pacific, it will be crucial that \nmonitoring  processes  be  customized  to  country  contexts.  There  are  data  implications  for \nreporting of corporate results by ADB and its development partners. Joint SDG tracking in \ncollaboration with relevant UN agencies will help assess the relevance of ADB operations, \ninform partnerships, and strengthen results. ADB expects to continue collaborating with key \npartners on data and indicators to support shared tracking of development progress.  \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact will be contribution to SDG progress in Asia and the Pacific.9 The outcomes \nwill be: (ii) enhanced ADB collaboration on joint SDG tracking and shared assessment of \nimplementation challenges and opportunities for DMCs; and (ii) a cohesive ADB response to \nSDGs, including potential business prospects and future strategic directions. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n14.  The TA will have four major outputs: \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2015.

ODI \nWorking Paper Series. No. 364. London: Overseas Development Institute. \n8  Following the 11 March agreement on the 230 global SDG indicators, further work includes establishing a tier \nsystem, methodological review and revisions, and reporting mechanisms. \n9  This is consistent with aims and motivations outlined in Agenda 2030 and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. \n ", " 4 \n(i)  Regional  tracking  and  reporting  of  progress  on  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Goals  supported.  This  output  will  include  data  updates, \ndisaggregation,  measurement  methodology,  gap  identification  and  support  to \nimprovements  over  time.  SDG  indicators  will  be  harmonized  with  FFD \nindicators.10 Collaboration on data will aim to progressively improve tracking of \nSDG progress in the region.  Externally, this will involve working with the UN \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the UN Development \nProgramme, and other development partners and experts. Such collaboration will \nhelp establish a shared understanding of changes within and across countries, \nand support customization and an evidence-based assessment of disparities in \nachievement  and  opportunities.  Within  ADB,  data  outputs  will  contribute  to \nresults reporting that reflects SDG progress, and improves the assessment of the \nongoing relevance of ADB strategies and operations. \n(ii)  Strategic regional reports, technical papers, and studies relevant to the \nSustainable  Development Goals  produced. Knowledge outputs include the \nregional SDG report produced jointly with the UN Development Programme and \nthe UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific11. An ADB \nstrategic report supporting Agenda 2030; relevant technical background papers, \npolicy  and  issues  briefs;  and  country  studies  on  locally  relevant  means  of \nimplementation,  including  finance;  are  other  outputs,  recognizing  the  high \naspirations  of  the  SDGs.  Thus  the  TA  will  develop  issue-based  strategic \nknowledge products for policy advocacy on SDG-related development priorities \nand implementation challenges in DMCs. They will draw upon inputs from ADB\u2019s \nknowledge departments. \n(iii)  Structured  policy  dialogues  and  advocacy  on  Sustainable  Development \nGoals conducted. The TA will support regional and/or subregional and global \nforums,  workshops,  and  multi-stakeholder  consultations  on  SDG-related \ndevelopment priorities, implementation challenges, and opportunities. At least 6 \nevents will be held. A communications plan will be developed to strengthen \nadvocacy  internally  and  externally,  with  guidance  from  the  Department  of \nExternal Relations. The TA will support platforms within and outside ADB to \nshare  policy-relevant  ideas  through  strategic  multi-stakeholder  knowledge \nexchange (including blogs, webspace, and other opportunities such as online \ndiscussions)  to  reach  wider  audiences.  The  dialogue  will  contribute  to  build \ncountry capacities on SDG implementation in the region as well as in ADB. \n(iv)  Strategic  and  operational  framework  scoping  ADB\u2019s  response  to  the \nSustainable Development Goals prepared. A scoping paper will be produced \nidentifying potential directions to help build ADB\u2019s response to the SDGs in a \nmanner that is relevant and customized to fit the circumstances of various DMCs, \nand will thereby help ADB respond to new investment opportunities. Gender \nperspectives and sex-disaggregated data will be integrated, as will a stronger \nresponsiveness to inclusion overall. The TA will help to better reflect the SDGs in \nADB\u2019s  strategic  directions,  operations,  and  results  reporting.  The  project \nclassification system will be updated to reflect how ADB operations, including \ncofinancing, impact the SDGs, and identify contributions to achievement of the \n                                                \n10 The UN has initiated follow-up on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. The first forum (held in New York on 18\u201320 \nApril 2016) will feed into the implementation review of Agenda 2030. Monitoring progress on financing is to be \nharmonized with SDG progress monitoring as the latter includes financing under the means of implementation. \n11 ADB, UN Development Programme, and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific will be \njoint copyright owners in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the ADB and the UN \nrepresented  by  the  Secretariat  of  the  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  on  joint \npublications concluded on 25 April 2013. \n ", "5  \nSDGs  through  ADB-financed  and  cofinanced  projects.  The  TA  will  support \nAgenda 2030 overall rather than focus on individual goals, which are better \naddressed by relevant thematic and sector groups. \n \n15.  Key assumptions include (i) DMC commitment to the SDGs; (ii) significance of evidence-\nbased  policies  to  support  SDG  progress;  and  (iii)  the  strategic  importance  of  ADB  as  a \ncontributor of funds, knowledge, and policy dialogue in the region. A potential risk is a change in \norganizational mandate or approach of probable partners, which will be minimized through \npotential  issue-specific  engagement  with  various  partners  (e.g.,  multilateral  and  bilateral). \nAnother risk is the possible interruption of work due to economic, environmental, and/or security \nshocks, which could have global and/or regional implications requiring more immediate attention. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,400,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. The Strategy and Policy Department will \nadminister  and  implement  the  TA  from  June  2016  to  December  2019.  The  Sustainable \nDevelopment  and  Climate  Change  Department,  the  Economic  Research  and  Regional \nCooperation  Department,  and  relevant  sector  and  thematic  groups  will  be  consulted  for \ntechnical inputs in respect of selected outputs. Inputs will also be sought from the ADB Institute. \nA cross-departmental advisory team will be constituted for specific outputs as needed. The \nDepartment of External Relations will provide guidance on communications and strengthen \ndissemination. \n \n18.  The TA will support regional and global collaboration, including through partnerships with \nUN agencies, coordination with other multilateral development banks, and work undertaken with \nother development partners. Subregional organizations will be included when useful to TA \nactivities. Collaboration with national institutions may be considered (e.g., for country-specific \nstudies  with  wider  subregional  and/or  regional  or  global  application),  as  well  as  through \nparticipation in workshops and meetings. \n \n19.  The TA will support hiring of individual and institutional expertise, and inputs from think \ntanks and universities will also be sought. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network, a \nglobal initiative for the UN to build scientific and technological expertise on SDG implementation, \nwill help attract SDG know-how. Consultant terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  Consultants will be recruited in accordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). For organizational partners, the respective \nadministrative arrangements agreed by ADB with these potential partners will apply. Funds will \nbe disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,400,000 on a grant basis \nfor  Agenda  2030:  Supporting  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  through  Strategic \nPartnerships and Preparedness, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact(s) the TA is Aligned with:  \nSDG progress in Asia and the Pacific supporteda \n  Performance Indicators with Targets and  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcomes       \n1.
