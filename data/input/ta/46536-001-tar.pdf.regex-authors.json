In  2012,  during  a  fact-finding  mission  to  prepare  Azerbaijan\u2019s  financial  sector \nassessment, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor policy advice to develop the microfinance sector and support financial inclusion in Azerbaijan. \nThe proposed technical assistance (TA) was included in the country operations business plan, \n2014\u20132016.1 Through a video conference in May 2013, the CBA confirmed its interest in the \nproposed scope of this TA. A fact-finding mission took place from 23 to 31 July 2013 where the \nCBA, the government\u2019s executing agency, agreed on the proposed impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.2 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bolstered by strong hydrocarbon export revenues, the Government of Azerbaijan has \nbeen able to increase budget expenditure substantially since 2001, boosting economic growth. \nAnnual gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged close to 14% from 2001 to 2011, and \nallowed  substantial  poverty  reduction.3 However,  growth  has  not  diversified  regionally  and \nacross economic sectors, leading to large income disparities and higher poverty levels in rural \nareas and secondary cities. Economic activity is concentrated in Azerbaijan\u2019s capital, Baku; and \nin the Sumqayit region, which is the center of the oil and gas, chemicals and metallurgy, and \nfood processing industries. The Baku area accounts for only 29% of the population. Azerbaijan\u2019s \neconomy is dominated by large enterprises, with micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises \ncontributing less than 10% to GDP. Spurring economic activity outside Baku and addressing \ndevelopment constraints facing micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises is essential to make \ngrowth more inclusive and to reduce poverty. It will also help support new sources of economic \ngrowth outside the traditional oil and gas sector. The government prioritizes development of the \nnon-oil sector and economic diversification to achieve more balanced and sustainable economic \ndevelopment\u2014including  increasing  access  to  financial  services  and  a  more  balanced \ndevelopment of financial service providers, such as nonbank credit institutions (NBCIs).4  \n \n3.  Inclusive financial systems in which all working age adults have effective access to credit, \nsavings, payments and insurance from formal service providers, are crucial to broad-based \ngrowth. 5  Access to finance is a key development constraint for micro, small, and medium-sized \nenterprises, especially in rural areas of Azerbaijan. Despite recent progress, Azerbaijan\u2019s bank-\ndominated financial sector is still small, with private credit equivalent to only 18% of GDP. This \nlevel is well behind other transition countries in the region and countries of similar GDP per \ncapita. Banks mainly provide services in Baku and Sumqayit, which receive close to 90% of \nbank loans. Less than 15% of the adult population has a bank account, and only 2% save in a \nformal financial institution\u2014a very low level of household savings.6 \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 August 2013. \n3  According to the State Statistical Committee, the percentage of the population living under the national poverty \nline declined from 49% in 2001 to just below 8% in 2011. However, significant concerns exist regarding the \ndefinition of that poverty line. The minimum wage and the cut-off point to receive social aid are below subsistence \nminimum levels. Vulnerability of people just above the poverty line is also an issue. Progress has relied heavily on \nemployment-generating programs of the government and social protection measures.  \n4  Government of Azerbaijan. 2013. Azerbaijan Strategy 2020.

Microfinance is a powerful tool to deliver financial services for low-income people and \nmicroenterprises,  especially  in  rural  areas.  The  microfinance  sector  in  Azerbaijan  started \ndeveloping  in  the  mid-1990s,  led  by  foreign  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  Sector \ndevelopment was constrained by legal limits to the ownership structure, making it difficult to \ncommercialize  and  tap  international  wholesale  funding.  As  a  result,  the  total  number  of \nmicrofinance organizations increased slowly from 14 in 2004 to 18 in 2007\u20132010. The policy \nand regulatory regime for microfinance organizations changed in 2010, through the enactment \nof a new law on NBCIs. The law allowed new legal forms, including transformation into for-profit \ncompanies, thus facilitating the entry of new equity investment. Regulatory responsibility for \nnonbank lenders was transferred to the CBA from the Cabinet of Minister\u2019s Department for \nProblems of Refugees. The CBA introduced prudential regulation for NBCIs that take collateral \nin the form of deposits. Resource mobilization by NBCIs through deposit taking, however, is not \nyet legal. The new framework seems to have sparked an increased interest in the sector, with \nnine additional NBCIs entering the market in 2011. Most of the new entrants are domestic \ninvestors, who regard microfinance as a profitable business.  \n   \n5.  At the end of 2012, Azerbaijan had 28 microfinance organizations and 104 credit unions, \ncollectively  called  NBCIs.  An  increasing  number  of  banks  also  provide  microloans.7 The \nmicrocredit portfolio amounted to $1.4 billion for banks and $0.6 billion for NBCIs, with over \n600,000 borrowers (one-third of them with banks and the remainder with NBCIs).8 However, \ntheir combined assets still represent less than 2% of GDP, which is small from an international \nperspective. Only nine out of 28 microfinance providers have over $10 million in microfinance \nassets. Portfolios have been growing rapidly in recent years, but institutions still report a large \nun-serviced demand that they cannot meet, partly because of funding limitations.9 NBCIs obtain \nmost of their funding from international investors and development agencies, mainly in foreign \ncurrency.10 The two largest providers of microfinance, Access Bank and the Foundation for \nInternational Community Assistance (FINCA), account for close to 40% of the microcredit clients. \nThe 33 leading providers of microloans are members of the Azerbaijan Microfinance Association \n(AMFA), an NGO.11 At the end of April 2013, AMFA members had an outstanding microfinance \ncredit portfolio of $0.9 billion equivalent and almost 490,000 active borrowers, up from 100,000 \nin 2006. Their average portfolio at risk was less than 2%. \n \n6.  NBCIs  in  Azerbaijan  have  a  very  limited  product  range  (mainly  short-term  credit), \nconstrained by regulations and low investment in product development. The average loan size \nof AMFA members is $1,800. NBCI loans are usually smaller than that, while bank loans are \nlarger. Individual loans dominate, but some institutions make intensive use of group lending. \nFemale borrowers represent less than 30% of the clients. Loan interest rates are 20%\u201350% per \nannum. While small, NBCIs play a crucial role in facilitating access to financial services in rural \nareas,  since  banks  and  ATMs  remain  heavily  concentrated  around  Baku.  Some  larger \nmicrofinance organizations, such as FINCA, are interested in becoming banks to offer their \n                                                                                                                                                       \naverages for the region (45% for accounts and 7% for savings) or for upper-middle-income countries (57% for \naccounts and 24% for savings).  \n7  No definition of microfinance or of microloans exists in law or in regulations. A commonly shared definition refers \nto loan sizes from $100 to $20,000, and other product features (e.g., frequency of repayments).   \n8  Microfinance Information Exchange. Microfinance database. www.mixmarket.org (accessed July 2013).  \n9  AMFA estimates that more than 400,000 small and micro-enterprises have no access to financial services.  \n10  FINCA issued a AZN10 million bond in the local market in July 2013. Pasha Bank in June 2013 created an apex \nfund of AZN10 million to lend to NBCIs for onlending to micro, small, and medium enterprises, but many NBCIs \nsee this as small in size and in noncompetitive terms (14%). \n11  AMFA was created in 2001 and registered as an NGO in 2004. It groups the 33 leading providers of microfinance \nin Azerbaijan and is responsible for industry data collection and dissemination, capacity building, industry self-\nregulation, and advocacy for sector development. ", "3 \ncustomers a broader range of services, but attempts have failed in the past. No tiered licensing \nframework exists.  \n \n7.  With the recent stronger growth of microfinance portfolios, concerns about consumer \nprotection have been rising. This is important as financial literacy is very low.12 Cases of multiple \nborrowing and risks of over-indebtedness are becoming apparent in some regions.13 In 2013 \nNBCIs were granted full access to the public credit registry, which should help mitigate the risks. \nIn early 2013, the CBA reduced the costs of accessing the registry to encourage more frequent \nuse in the loan underwriting process. AMFA has initiated the development of industry consumer \nprotection standards and has signed on to the SMART Client Protection principles, which it is \ndisseminating to its members. 14  An ongoing project, supported by the World Bank and funded \nthrough the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, is looking at financial consumer \nprotection  and financial  literacy  issues.  Recent  CBA guidelines to  enforce transparency of \neffective  interest  rates  (applicable  to  all  credit  institutions)  have  been  a  first  step  toward \nimproved consumer protection. Regulation in this area is still weak.  \n \n8.  Sustainable finance growth and outreach to rural low-income households requires better \nstrategy,  policy,  and  market  understanding.  The  government  does  not  yet  have  a  policy \nstatement or national strategy for financial inclusion, or consensus about the needs\u2014and types \nof acceptable delivery mechanisms\u2014for different financial products and services for households, \nmicroenterprises, and smaller businesses. CBA has limited reliable and comparable data to \nunderstand the state of financial inclusion.  \n \n9.  A strategic approach for financial inclusion is needed, which considers the introduction of \nnew services such as microinsurance, remittances and payment services, and micro leasing \nthrough NBCIs. As deposit mobilization is limited for NBCIs, strategic partnerships between \nNBCIs and other forms of financial institutions should be explored. Some agreements to provide \npayments  services  are  in  place.  These  partnerships  may  be  combined  with  branchless \nbanking.15 As agents, NBCIs could provide a wider array of services, including deposit and \npayment services.  \n \n10.  The issues to be addressed under the TA include (i) government understanding of the \nmarket and the need for a strategy for growth; and (ii) regulatory practices that will facilitate \nresponsible market growth and better outreach, with more services. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of this TA will be improved access to a wider range of financial services by \nlow-income individuals and microenterprises outside Baku.  \n \n12.  The outcome will be an improved policy, regulatory, and supervisory framework for \nmicrofinance service provision.  \n                                                \n12  AMFA. 2009.

Under  this  output, a  household  survey;  individual  product  assessment  reports \n(credit and savings, microinsurance, payments); and a compilation diagnostic study will be \ncompleted. This study will examine (i) market demand for and use of financial services such as \nsavings, micro-insurance, and payment services in rural areas and secondary cities (including a \nhousehold  survey);  (ii)  supply  of  financial  services;  and  (iii)  regulatory  and  supervisory \nframework and gaps. The consultants will propose a methodology for conducting the diagnosis \nand  will  assess  (i)  the  current  institutional  structure,  policies,  and  financial  infrastructure \naffecting financial inclusion; (ii) the legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework; (iii) supply, use, \nand demand for financial products and services for low-income households (including a variety \nof products like credit, savings, payment services and remittances, microinsurance, and new \ndelivery mechanisms like mobile and branchless banking), including any gender bias in terms of \naccess and affordability; and (iv) consumer protection. This will involve close collaboration with \nrelevant government agencies and extensive consultation with key stakeholders.   \n \n14.  Output 2: Financial inclusion strategy and related implementation road map on \nregulatory  and  supervision  reforms  presented  to  CBA  and  other  stakeholders,  and \nimplementation initiated. Under output 2, the consultants will assist the CBA in developing a \nfinancial inclusion strategy and a related implementation road map focusing on regulatory and \nsupervision reforms and market improvements. The consultants will hold a series of government \nand stakeholder meetings and workshops to develop and discuss a draft strategy and action \nplan. Once consensus for the strategy is achieved, a national stakeholder workshop will be held \nto present the strategy to relevant financial institutions, development partners, NGOs, and other \nkey stakeholders. At the workshop, participants will indicate the top three priorities for action \nplan implementation. The financial inclusion strategy and action plan will be submitted for \nconsideration and approval by the CBA and the government. Two priority steps of the action \nplan related to microfinance regulation and supervision will be implemented. \n \n15.  Output  3:  CBA  staff  capacity  to  regulate  and  supervise  microfinance  sector \noperations,  institutions,  development,  and  deepening  of  service  provision  improved. \nOutput 3 will increase CBA capacity to regulate and supervise microfinance sector operations, \ninstitutions, and deepening of service provision. A training needs assessment will be followed by \na  series  of  capacity-building  workshops  to  address  needs.  Possible  areas  of training  may \ninclude risk-based supervision for NBCIs, international best practices on legal and regulatory \noptions  to  allow  the  development  of  new  products  and  services,  and  mobile  banking  and \nbranchless banking. The TA could also support participation in regional knowledge events and \npeer-to-peer exchanges. The consultants will assist CBA staff in improving the standards for \nreporting and data collection and analysis methods.   \n \n16.  Key  assumptions  include  that  (i)  the  government  remains  committed  to  continued \nmicrofinance reforms; (ii) the government and the CBA devote time and staff for the participatory \ndiscussions  to  develop,  approve,  and  implement  the  strategy  and  road  map;  (iii)  public \nregulators, financial institutions, and other private companies and key stakeholders interact \nregularly to discuss market development; and (iv) collaboration with development partners is \nstrong to avoid duplication and create synergies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which $300,000 equivalent will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $300,000 ", "5 \nequivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership \nFund16 to be administered by ADB. The latter will be disbursed on a front loading basis. The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff time, office space \nand workshop venues, and in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 2.5 years, from March 2014 to October 2016. The \nexecuting  agency  will  be  CBA.  ADB  will  be  the  implementing  agency,  with  the  Public \nManagement, Financial Sector and Trade Division of the Central and West Asia Department \nacting  as  the focal  point  and  coordinator  of consultants\u2019  inputs. The TA  will  require three \ninternational  consultants  (for  10.5 person-months)  and  two  national  consultants  (for  11.0 \nperson-months) to be recruited as individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Individual recruitment is \njustified  by  (i) the  small  number  of  consultants  involved,  which  does  not  require  collective \nresponsibility; (ii) individual experience and qualifications being the main requirements; and (iii) \nsimplicity of recruitment requirements to expedite the engagement process. The consultants will \nhave expertise in microfinance, microinsurance, and payments services. AMFA will conduct the \nhousehold survey under output 1.17 The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \nDisbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n19.  The TA activities will be monitored through regular consultations, including inception and \nregular review missions, and tripartite meetings with relevant stakeholders. Activities will also be \nmonitored through  periodic  reporting from  consultants,  which  will  incorporate monitoring  of \noutputs, activities, and indicators listed in the design and monitoring framework. Consultants\u2019 \nreports will be presented in workshops and seminars organized for the validation of findings. \nReports will be made available on the ADB website and published if warranted. Knowledge \nproducts on the process and results will be developed. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund, and (ii) ADB \nproviding  the  balance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $300,000  on  a  grant  basis,  to  the \nGovernment of Azerbaijan for Microfinance Sector Development, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board.  \n \n \n                                                \n16  Contributor: Government of Luxembourg. \n17  The rationale for the proposed single-source selection of the AMFA is based on (i) AMFA\u2019s track record in \nconducting  work  of  this  nature  in  the  microfinance  sector  and  its  far-reaching  understanding  of  sector \ndevelopment issues and clients\u2019 needs (noting that this is a demand survey); (ii) the small size of the assignment \n(less than $100,000); and (iii) AMFA\u2019s engagement with the CBA and other key stakeholders to support policy, \nregulatory, and operational reforms.
