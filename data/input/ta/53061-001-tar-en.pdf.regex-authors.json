INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia has requested support to strengthen the policy environment \nfor noncommunicable disease (NCD) control and pharmaceutical regulation through evidence-\nbased research. The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the Ministry of \nHealth improve the population's health by (i) strengthening capacity for pharmaceutical regulation, \n(ii) providing guidance for policies on NCDs, and (iii) expanding awareness for NCDs and \nmedicine safety. \n \n2.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2017\u20132020  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for Mongolia. It is also consistent with three operational priorities of \nADB's Strategy 2030\u2014(i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality, and (iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.1 The \nTA is included in ADB's country operations business plan, 2020\u20132021 for Mongolia,2 and is \naligned with Mongolia's State Policy on Health, 2017\u20132026,3 which reaffirms the government's \nsustained commitment to improving health services for the population. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Mongolia has made significant progress in improving its health outcomes. Life expectancy \nat birth increased to 70.19 years in 2018, compared with 69.00 years in 2016. Mongolia achieved \nits Millennium Development Goal targets in 2015 for maternal and child mortality. It reduced the \ninfant mortality rate from 16 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015 to 14 deaths per 1,000 live births \nin 2018, and in the same period also reduced the under-5 mortality rate from 19 to 16 deaths per \n1,000 live births. Maternal mortality decreased from 51 (in 2013) to 45 (in 2017) per 100,000 live \nbirths. While health outcomes have improved, the country still struggles with systemic issues such \nas unregulated and substandard medicines, which lead to poor treatment of noncommunicable \nand communicable diseases and impact the overall efficacy of curative medical care. \n \n4.  Noncommunicable diseases leading cause of death and disability. Mongolia has \nexperienced a demographic shift from communicable diseases to NCDs, and the burden of NCDs \ncontinues to grow. Dietary risk factors, high blood pressure, alcohol abuse, and tobacco use are \nthe leading drivers of death and disability, and directly related to the prevalence of NCDs.4 \nPhysical inactivity, high stress, and unhealthy diets compound this. Preventing NCDs through \nbehavior change and effective case management remains the most effective way to reduce the \ndisease burden. Mongolia has had an NCD program in place since 2005 for early detection, \nprevention, and control. The Third National Program on NCD Prevention and Control, 2017\u20132021 \naims to reduce the prevalence of primary and intermediate risk factors, and the morbidity and \nmortality rates of NCDs.5 Although the third national program is ongoing, studies suggest that \nprimary health care (PHC) facilities do not have the capacity to provide basic services at minimum \n \n1  ADB. 2017.

It is estimated that they are only able to provide 51.7% of the required NCD services.6 \nThis is quite low and can impair the quality of services, especially since NCD treatment requires \ncurative care with a robust PHC system to manage cases cost-effectively. Underutilization and \nlack of gatekeeping of PHC also contribute to poor NCD outcomes. Insufficient provision of NCD \nservices, especially in primary care settings, is a notable quality gap that requires strategic \ninvestment, better prevention strategies, and management of caseloads. To bridge this gap, the \nState Policy on Health (footnote 3) proposes to establish public health centers that will deliver \nNCD  prevention  services  and  outreach  to  communities.  However,  NCD  treatment  is  also \nweakened by the poor quality of drugs on the market because proper regulation is lacking.  \n \n5.  Substandard  drugs  and  high  rates  of  antibiotic  resistance.  The  prevalence  of \nsubstandard (10.1%), unregistered (4.3%), and falsified medicines (0.8%) in Mongolia is one of \nthe highest in the world.7 Low quality, high cost, and irrational use of medicines are some of the \nleading issues in the health sector. Pharmaceutical regulation is also highly fragmented; functions \nsuch as licensing and registration, pricing, quality, market surveillance and control, inspection and \nenforcement, integrated regulatory information system, and rational use are implemented by \ndifferent agencies, rather than by one single drug regulation authority, which leads to poor \ncoordination and increases inefficiencies. Moreover, noncompliance by local drug manufacturers \nwith good manufacturing practices and the absence of an independent national drug regulation \nauthority compromise the safety of medicines in the country.  \n \n6.  Given the shortcomings of local drug manufacturers, the pharmaceutical market relies \nprimarily on imported medicines. Drug procurement in the public sector is decentralized, however, \nand every public hospital is required to purchase its medicines directly from private suppliers. This \nand the absence of price regulation drive up the prices of medicines and also affects the \navailability of essential medicines in public health facilities. The harmful consequences of unsafe \ndrugs and the incidence of adverse drug events erode public trust in the health system and \nundermine the use of health services.8  \n \n7.  ADB has already assisted earlier efforts to improve drug safety in Mongolia,9 and this TA \nwill support the fundamental reforms of the pharmaceutical industry set out in the revised draft \nLaw on Medicines and Medical Devices. They include setting up a single regulatory body \nresponsible for all aspects of pharmaceutical regulation, introducing medicines regulation, and \npromoting the rational use of medicines. It is imperative to boost capacity and strengthen policies \naround drug safety in Mongolia to reduce access to expensive and often substandard medicines.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: quality and accessibility of health services \nincreased (footnote 3).10 The TA will have the following outcome: regulations for NCDs and \nmedicine safety improved.  \n \n6  A.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Capacity for pharmaceutical regulation enhanced. The TA team will provide \ncapacity building to policymakers and parliamentarians to keep them abreast of the key reform \nareas set out in the revised draft Law on Medicines and Medical Devices, and conduct additional \nanalytical work on the expected impact of the law on the pharmaceutical market. The team will \n(i) organize an international study tour11 for parliamentarians and policymakers to gain knowledge \nfrom other countries on the best practices and key characteristics of an independent drug \nregulation agency; (ii) carry out extensive domestic training, workshops, and webinars on the \nchanges in the revised draft law, with sufficient female representation; (iii) undertake a financial \nanalysis of the proposed changes to the revised draft law to be used as evidence-based research \nfor policymakers; and (iv) develop draft regulations to facilitate the implementation of the revised \nlaw, once passed, in close coordination with multisector stakeholders.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Policy guidance for noncommunicable diseases provided. This output \nsupports the development of key policy documents on NCDs and a set of policy recommendations. \nThe TA team will (i) review and analyze the implementation of the current national program on \nNCD prevention and control; (ii) identify gaps and generate key recommendations for the next \nsteps; (iii) develop the fourth national program on NCD prevention and control through extensive \nstakeholder consultations, and identify specific gender needs; (iv) support the establishment of \npublic health centers by defining their organizational structure, job descriptions, and training on \nNCD screening and detection; and (v)  build the capacity of staff in the new public health centers. \n \n11.  Output 3: Awareness of noncommunicable diseases and medicine safety improved. \nThe TA team will organize two workshops and a final conference for government officials, \nrepresentatives from professional associations, and international and other research partners to \ndiscuss and disseminate the TA findings and policy recommendations. The team will provide \npolicymakers with advocacy material for the revised draft Law on Medicines and Medical Devices, \nand  produce  brochures  on  NCDs; this  will  be  the most  effective method  of  disseminating \ninformation.12 Information on NCD awareness and behavior change will also be disseminated. An \neconomic analysis of the costs and benefits of the revised draft law and the NCD program will be \ndeveloped. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $987,000, of which $937,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, \nvenue for meetings, counterpart staff, miscellaneous administration expenses, and other in-kind \ncontributions.  \n   \n \n11 Study tours will be in ADB developing member countries. If international travel is still restricted because of the global \npandemic, virtual tours or a series of webinars will be explored instead. \n12 ADB may print the advocacy materials for policymakers.
