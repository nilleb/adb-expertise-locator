This technical assistance (TA) seeks to address the recommendations of the meeting of \nthe South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) energy working group (EWG) held \nin  November  2012  in  Thimphu,  Bhutan,  in  which  representatives  of  the  governments  of \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka participated. These recommendations were \nbased on the proposals of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to take forward regional energy \ncooperation activities on the basis of recent ADB-financed studies such as the South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Regional Energy Trade Study (SRETS) and the \nSouth Asia Regional Power Exchange Study (SARPES).1 The outline of the TA, with emphasis \non its impact, outcome, outputs, implementing arrangements, cost and financing, and terms of \nreference for consultants, was discussed briefly during the inaugural meeting on 1 October 2013 \nin Sri Lanka of the SASEC Electricity Transmission Utility Forum (SETUF), which represents all \nthe countries participating in the SASEC energy sector. The activities relating to the TA were \nnoted, and some were included in the SETUF work plan for the year 2013/14.2 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Population growth over the next 4 decades will be concentrated in South Asia. The \nshare in Asia of South Asia\u2019s population is also expected to grow. Fulfilment of basic energy \nneeds for the growing population and the accompanying economic growth are major challenges, \nparticularly because energy resources are not always concentrated in areas where demand is \ngrowing. In most cases, such concentrations go beyond country boundaries. At present, there is \nno  systematic  approach  to  address  the  long-term  energy  needs  of  these  populations, \nconsidering the opportunities beyond national boundaries, or to harness the geographically \ndistributed resources for the benefit of communities across the region. \n \n3.  Power systems in South Asia offer significant diversity in terms of availability of primary \nenergy resources for electricity generation and demand for power.3 However, efforts to exploit \nthis diversity for the benefit of the region\u2019s economies have been very limited. Many countries in \nthe region continue to have peak electric power supply shortages because generation capacity \nadditions do not match demand growth. Power system planning in each jurisdiction is also \nheavily focused at the national level, with limited recognition of the availability of cleaner and \ncheaper  resources  across  national  borders. This  includes  limited  attention to technological \nadvances,  particularly  in  renewable  energy  development,  and  increasing  emphasis  on \ndecentralized sources of power generation. \n \n4.  Any  effort  within  the  region  to  reduce  electricity  shortages  would  have  significant \neconomic benefits because of the high economic cost of unserved electricity.4 One feasible \noption is to allow cross-border electricity trade in any surplus that the countries may have\u2014over \na day, over seasons, or at any other time. Power-exporting countries will benefit from increased \nexport revenue, which can be used to enhance budgets for efficient delivery of infrastructure \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2012.

Findings  of  the  ADB-financed  SRETS  and  SARPES  highlighted  and \nquantified  the  large  potential  of  such  cross-border  power  trading  through  regional  power \ninterconnections.  This  potential  should  be  recognized  in  power  system  planning  so  that \ngeneration and transmission developments within each country can be aligned over time to \nconsider large-scale, cross-border power trading. \n \n5.  One of the major issues associated with development of the regional power market\u2014\nbased on large-scale, cross-border power trading\u2014is the absence or unavailability of adequate \ncross-border interconnection capacity. Currently, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal have a limited \nnumber of cross-border power interconnections with India. There are proposals to enhance \nthese interconnection capacities, as well as to establish interconnections between India and \nSri Lanka, and between India and Pakistan. Given the untapped hydropower potential in the \nregion, it is envisaged that cross-border interconnection capacity would exhibit a significant \nincrease beyond the existing and planned interconnectors over the next 20 years. Rationalized \nregional power sector planning to identify and prioritize new power interconnectors will give a \nfirm implementation basis to the vision enshrined in the SRETS and SARPES. \n \n6.  Development of adequate cross-border transmission capacity needs to be carried out on \na regional basis to reap maximum economic benefits. This  requires the development of a \nregional transmission plan for cross-border power trade, which was unanimously requested by \nthe member countries at the SASEC EWG meeting in November 2012 and at the SETUF \ninaugural meeting. Progressing toward cross-border power trade among member countries of \nSASEC would require close dialogue and networking among all stakeholders concerned, which \ncan be largely handled through the SASEC EWG and SETUF. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact of the TA will be the cross-border regional electricity transmission plan \nimplemented. The outcome of the TA will be improved planning capacity of SASEC to foster cross-\nborder power trading. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The key output of the TA will be regional electricity transmission plan for cross-border trade \namong  SASEC  countries  completed.  The  second  output  would  be  improved  networking  among \nSASEC countries and knowledge on cross-border power trading. \n   \n9.  The TA will first develop a 400 kilovolt (kV) and above transmission network database \nfor long-term regional transmission planning using a transmission planning software. It will \nexamine the power generation options for the region, with optimal use of renewable energy \nsources; and estimate the intermittency of their energy outputs together with nonrenewable \nenergy  sources,  capturing  their  availability  and  transport  constraints.  A  regional  electricity \ngeneration plan will then be developed, taking into account available national generation plans \nand expanding them considering both renewable and nonrenewable resource availability. Based \non these inputs, a regional transmission master plan will be developed with a focus area to \nidentify economic opportunities for cross-border power exchanges. Particular emphases will be \non the major interconnection points along the India\u2013Nepal and India\u2013Bhutan borders; and the \nbackbone power transmission system within Nepal and Bhutan at 400 kV level for transfer of \nlarge quantities of hydropower.  \n ", "  3 \n \n10.  During  the  analysis,  a  limited  number  of  scenarios  relevant  to  a  regional  power \nexchange operation will be developed, including some combinations of (i) deep emissions cuts \nin the region, (ii) high cost of demand growth, (iii) limited coal availability and high coal and gas \nprices, and (iv) high renewable energy development. The economic analyses of different power \ntrade options will be carried out from the perspective of (i) optimizing regional resources, (ii) \nimproving the overall reliability of electric supply in the region, and (iii) environmental benefits. \n \n11.  The activities under the  proposed subproject on Power Trading in Bangladesh and \nNepal  under  regional  technical  assistance  on  South  Asia  Regional  Economic  Integration \nPartnership will supplement the activities of the TA.  Both the subproject and the TA will be \nexecuted and all the activities will be coordinated by the South Asia Energy Division of ADB.   \n \n12.  The  TA  will  also  use  consultants  to  assist  in  arranging  the  capacity  development \nprograms and intergovernmental meetings associated with operation of SETUF.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Fund.5 The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. The activities of the TA will be carried out in \nconsultation with the SASEC member states and the members of SETUF in particular, on a \nregular basis. The activities of the TA are expected to commence by 1 February 2014, and \nestimated completion will be 31 March 2016. 6 \n \n15.  The  TA  will  require  the  services  of  three  international  consultants  for  a  total  of \n15 person-months and one national consultant for 12 person-months. The consulting team will \nconsist  of  an  international  power  system  economist  (team  leader),  an  international  power \nsystem planning specialist, an international senior advisor, and a national senior programs \nanalyst.  ADB  will  recruit  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All four consultants will be recruited as \nindividual consultants. The outline of the terms of reference of the consultants are given in \nAppendix 3.  Procurement of goods will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n16.  The findings of the study will be disseminated through stakeholder seminars to be held \nafter completion of the study report, and through internal as well as external seminars and \nconferences. The report and the outcome evaluation will be made available on the ADB website \n                                                \n5  Established by ADB. \n6  Any activity in a SASEC member state will commence after ADB has received a no-objection in writing to its \ninclusion in the TA. \n ", "4   \nand the SASEC website.7 The interim findings will be presented and discussed during several \nintergovernmental meetings held with the participation of the SASEC member countries.   \n   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Cross-Border Power Trade Development, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n7  As agreed at the inception meeting of SETUF, a SETUF web portal will be established within the SASEC website \n(www.sasec.asia) to enable exchange of knowledge among SETUF members and serve as repository of relevant \nknowledge on regional energy cooperation. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2018:    Assumption \n       \nCross-border regional  Construction of at least  Annual reports of the  Continuous commitment \nelectricity transmission  two electricity  respective  of participating countries \nplan implemented.  interconnection projects  transmission utilities  to implement agreed \n  identified in the    plans to strengthen \n  transmission plan  cross-border electricity \ninfrastructure in a timely \nmanner \n \nRisk \n \nPolitical considerations \noverride all other \nconsiderations in \nregional energy \ncooperation \n \nOutcome  By 2016:    Assumption \n       \nImproved planning  At least four member  Minutes of the SASEC  Consistent and active \ncapacity of SASEC  countries of the SASEC  EWG meeting  participation of member \nfoster cross-border  EWG (consisting of    countries in EWG and \npower trading    Bangladesh, Bhutan,  Letters to ADB stating  SETUF meetings, and \nIndia, Nepal, and  endorsement of the  preparatory activities \nSri Lanka) approved the  SASEC electricity  carried out in between \nSASEC electricity  transmission plan  meetings  \ntransmission plan   \n  Risks \n \nSASEC EWG not being \nable to agree on the \nspecific \nrecommendations \nOutputs   By 2016:    Assumption \n       \n1.
