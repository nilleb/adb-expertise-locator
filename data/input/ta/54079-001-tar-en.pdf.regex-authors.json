INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the developing member \ncountries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) respond to the ongoing outbreak of \ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and potential outbreaks of other communicable diseases, \nwith the aim of mitigating long-term damage to economies and adverse effects on population \nhealth.  \n \n2.  The TA will support the implementation of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030,1 particularly operational \npriority 1, to address remaining poverty and reduce inequalities and enhance human capital and \nsocial protection for all; and operational priority 7, to foster regional cooperation and integration \nand support investment in regional public goods.2 The TA is included in the 2020 Management-\napproved  results-based  work  plan  of  the  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change \nDepartment (SDCC).3,4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The COVID-19 outbreak is escalating in severity. Since January 2020, the disease has \nspread from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) across five continents, prompting the World \nHealth Organization (WHO) to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International \nConcern. The COVID-19 outbreak is on the verge of becoming a major global crisis, and requires \ncountry,  regional,  and  global  intervention  and  collaboration  to  mitigate  further  damage  to \neconomies and population health. As a major development partner in Asia and the Pacific, ADB \nis well-positioned to support these response efforts.  \n \n4.  ADB has been collaborating with development partners and is scaling up financing for the \nCOVID-19  response.5  Key  activities  include  investigating  the  outbreak,  implementing  an \nemergency response plan, and taking immediate actions to prevent or minimize the spread of the \ndisease. Because the nature and massive scope of the outbreak is evolving rapidly, additional \nflexible resources are necessary.   \n \n5.  Based on official numbers, the COVID-19 outbreak infected three times as many people \nin 1 month as were infected in the entire severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of \n2003. These figures are likely underestimated; as diagnostic tests improve and more potential \ncases are investigated, it is possible that the virus has already spread further than is currently \nbelieved. Scientists have yet to discover how the disease first spread from animals to humans, \nthe exact transmission route between humans, and whether the disease is likely to mutate and \nbecome more deadly and/or harder to contain.  \n \n6.  Disease outbreaks have demonstrated their potential to have catastrophic impacts on \nsocial and economic development, and the COVID-19 outbreak could have similar long-lasting \neffects. Countries where tourism is responsible for 15% of gross domestic product, such as \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n3  This TA is one of a suite of response activities that ADB is undertaking to address the COVID-19 outbreak which will \nbe coordinated with departments and partners. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 February 2020. \n5  ADB. 2018. Strengthening Regional Health Cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila. ADB. 2014. \nGreater Mekong Subregion Health Security Project. Manila. \n ", "2 \nThailand and Cambodia, have expressed grave concern about the potential impact on their \neconomies. During outbreaks, airlines and the tourism industry are the first to suffer from \nquarantine and border restrictions, and general fear in society. Households and labor markets are \nquick to follow, as public anxiety over an outbreak reduces participation in the economy. Trade \nalso suffers as a result of quarantine and border control measures, which restrict the movement \nof goods. The PRC and other countries in Asia have taken rapid action to respond to the outbreak. \nDespite the quick action taken, there are several gaps in the overall response efforts, as identified \nby WHO and other development partners. These gaps are described in paras. 7\u20139. \n \n7.  Inadequate resources to strengthen services for outbreak response. WHO is taking \nthe lead in supporting response efforts in the area of human health, and has requested ADB \nsupport in strengthening the varying health security needs of countries, including (i) ensuring \nsufficient supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical goods; (ii) bolstering \ndiagnostic capabilities; (iii) establishing or strengthening emergency operations centers; (iv) \ntraining health workers on case detection and management; (v) enhancing risk communication; \n(vi) expanding disease surveillance in communities and points of entry; (vii) sharing information \nacross DMCs and development partners; (viii) improving clinical management and health care \nservices; (ix) strengthening infection management and control; and (x) developing multisector, \nmultihazard pandemic preparedness  and response  plans.  DMCs  require  access  to flexible \nfinancial and technical resources to expand their capacities in a timely manner to prevent the \nfurther spread of disease. \n  \n8.  Paucity of robust economic analysis and other evidence to support decision-\nmaking. Epidemic impacts can extend to all aspects of a country\u2019s economy, triggering short-\nterm fiscal shocks and with long-term negative consequences that threaten stability and economic \ngrowth. In past outbreaks, economic analyses have not been conducted until long after the \ndisease has stopped spreading. DMCs need support to generate evidence required to enact \neffective policy decisions that can mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and strengthen \nsystems to be more resilient to such shocks. Comprehensive economic analysis is needed to \ninform and evaluate decisions that may disrupt economic activities and business continuity. Such \nanalysis is needed in order to make immediate and long-term investments in both the health and \nnon-health sectors. \n \n9.  Weak  regional  multisector  coordination  mechanisms.  National  health  systems, \nregional coordination, and global arrangements remain deficient in two keyways. First, most \ndisease prevention and response strategies adopt a country-by-country approach, under the \nassumption that strengthening national capacity is sufficient for protecting local health. The ease \nwith which COVID-19 has spread across the globe demonstrates flaws in this logic and highlights \nthe need for a multinational approach. Second, health security is a multisector issue. While WHO \nhas strengthened the capacity to address diseases in terms of human health, such efforts must \nbe supported by contributions from other sectors. The One Health approach,6 which recognizes \nthe interface between human, animal, and environmental health in preventing, detecting, and \nresponding to disease outbreaks, is essential for effective pandemic preparedness and response. \nAs an example, the COVID-19 outbreak spread from animals to humans, and collaboration \nbetween animal and human disease experts is necessary to determine the mechanism by which \n \n6  One Health is an approach to designing and implementing programs, policies, legislation, and research in which \nentities from multiple sectors communicate and work together to achieve better public health outcomes. The areas \nof work in which a One Health approach is particularly relevant include the control of zoonoses (diseases that can \nspread between animals and humans (such as COVID-19, rabies, and Rift Valley fever), food safety, and combatting \nantibiotic resistance (when bacteria change after being exposed to antibiotics and become more difficult to treat). \nWHO. 2017. One Health. Geneva. \n ", "3 \n \nthis spread occurs and so prevent future outbreaks. Despite the multisector nature of pandemics, \nnot enough has been done to include sectors beyond human health in pandemic preparedness \nand response. Existing regional and international disease response coordination mechanisms \nand frameworks, such as the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health \nEmergencies (APSED), the Global Health Security Agenda, and International Health Regulations \nrequire increased support, especially in multinational and multisector efforts to prevent, detect, \nand respond to future outbreaks. Such efforts will contribute to resilient, sustainable systems that \ncan help prevent and rapidly respond to disease outbreaks.   \n \n10.  The  TA  will  incorporate  lessons  learned  from  (i)  the  Regional  Malaria  and  Other \nCommunicable Disease Threats Trust Fund and Health Trust Funds, (ii) the TA on Regional \nSupport to Address the Outbreak of SARS, (iii) the Grant Assistance for Prevention and Control \nof Avian Influenza in Asia and the Pacific, and (iv) the Greater Mekong Subregion\u2019s  (GMS\u2019s) \nStrengthening Regional Health Cooperation TA and Health Security Project.7 A major lesson is \nthat  flexible  implementation  arrangements  and  focus  on  the  actual  needs  of  DMCs  for \ncommunicable disease control (i.e., hospital equipment, training, and communication programs), \ntogether with multisector and cross-departmental collaboration in ADB and between ADB and \npartner organizations such as WHO, all contributed to the success of the projects. These projects \nand TAs also highlighted the importance of providing not only country assistance but also of \ncoordinating regional interventions and establishing regional coordination mechanisms similar to \nthe working group spearheading the implementation of the GMS Regional Health Cooperation \nStrategy.8  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) health outcomes in Asia and the Pacific \nimproved (footnote 1); (ii) access to improved health services increased (Operational Plan 1);9 \nand (iii) regional public-goods initiatives successfully reducing cross-border health risks increased \n(Operational Plan 7).10 The TA will have the following outcome: DMCs\u2019 capacities to prevent and \ncontain the outbreak of COVID-19 and other communicable diseases strengthened.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Support to developing member countries affected and potentially affected \nby coronavirus disease 2019 and other communicable diseases provided. Using the One \nHealth approach, this component will help DMCs bolster key health systems and multisector \ncapacities  to  prevent,  detect,  and  respond  to  the  ongoing  COVID-19  outbreak  and  future \ncommunicable  disease  outbreaks.  The  component  will  provide  resources  for  adapting  and \nenhancing existing country and regional outbreak and pandemic response plans, supporting the \n \n7  ADB. 2013.

All these activities and support will be \ndone  in  collaboration  with  concerned  regional  offices  and  country  offices  of  WHO12 using \ncoordination mechanisms such as APSED III, other development partners, universities, and other \ntechnical agencies.  \n \n13.   Output 2: Economic and health system assessments on the potential effect of  \ncoronavirus disease 2019 conducted. These assessments will generate evidence on potential \nhealth system impacts and economic risks posed by the COVID-19 outbreak. This activity will \nsupport country and regional epidemiological modeling and projections of COVID-19 spread, \nwhich will determine health system impacts. In coordination with the ADB Economic Research \nand Regional Cooperation Department and the regional departments, the TA will support country \nestimation of economic impacts in selected DMCs, and the conduct of impact evaluation of the \neffectiveness of selected interventions used by DMCs to address the outbreak. It will also support \nassessments on the impact on health service delivery, health financing, and other health system \nfunctions in selected DMCs. This component will support DMCs in conducting other assessments \nthat will help leverage existing ADB investments to address COVID-19 in the short term. It will \nalso facilitate the development of investment projects to meet long-term needs for building \nresilient systems and addressing future health security threats posed by communicable disease \noutbreaks. \n \n14.  Output  3:  Regional  multisector  coordination  mechanisms  strengthened.  This \ncomponent will support the establishment of an expert advisory group, which will guide the \nresponse of DMCs and ADB to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and recommend future measures \nto increase resilience to disease outbreaks. Collaboration with international organizations such \nas the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Organization for Animal \nHealth to strengthen DMCs\u2019 capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to animal and human \ndisease outbreaks under the One Health approach will be expanded. The component will also \nsupport a review of (i) the needs of existing regional mechanisms such as the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, APSED III, GMS \nRegional Health Cooperation working group, and Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network; and \n(ii)  the  options  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  improved  multisector  health  security \ncoordination mechanisms in Asia and the Pacific. All these activities will be carried out in close \ncoordination  with  operations  departments  and  across  sectors  at  ADB.  To  ensure  that  the \nknowledge generated from the TA is shared widely, a seminar will be held to share key lessons \nlearned from the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF)\u2014$1  million  from  TASF-6  and  $1  million  from                   \nTASF-other  sources.  ADB  will  also  actively  seek  additional  grant  cofinancing.  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n16.  The estimate covers the costs of (i) consultant services; (ii) procurement of necessary \nmedical supplies and reagents, medicines and vaccines, PPE for health care staffs, and digital \n \n \n12 WHO European Regional Office and Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office for ADB Central and West Asia \nDepartment DMCs, WHO Southeast Asia Regional Office for DMCs of ADB South Asia Department and parts of \nSoutheast Asia Department, and WHO Western Pacific Regional Office for DMCs of ADB East Asia Department, \nPacific Department, and parts of Southeast Asia Department. \n ", "5 \n \nhealth software and hardware needed for rapidly building DMCs\u2019 capacities; (iii) direct costs of TA \nimplementation, including international and local travel, monitoring and evaluation, reporting, and \nsupport for knowledge product development; (iv) assessments and topic-related studies, as may \nbe required by operations departments; (v) workshops, seminars, training sessions, technical \nmeetings, and conferences; (vi) staff missions for secretarial and administrative support services; \nand (vii) miscellaneous. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA and will be the executing agency. In close coordination with \nthe operations departments, the Health Sector Group Secretariat in SDCC will implement the TA \nand be accountable for the outputs. The Health Sector Group Secretariat will carry out TA \nadministration, supervision, implementation oversight, coordination with concerned government \nagencies, and communication with consultants and stakeholders, in close collaboration with the \noperations departments and other sector and thematic groups. ADB staff involved with the TA \nmay participate as resource persons in knowledge-sharing events, which will also include eliciting \nfeedback and suggestions on improving the activities being implemented under the TA. \n \n18.  The priority DMCs are those countries that (i) are currently not included in other ADB \nTA support for COVID-19 outbreak response, (ii) share a border with the PRC, (iii) have local \ntransmission of COVID-19, or (iv) have vulnerable health systems. Prioritization will be done in \nconsultation with the ADB operations departments. ADB will determine the specific assistance to \nthe prioritized DMCs based on guidance from the ADB operations departments and consultations \nwith WHO and other development partners, and assistance will be conditional on DMCs\u2019 request \nfor ADB support. \n \n19.
