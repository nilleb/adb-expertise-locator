In 2004,1 the governments of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), \nand Viet Nam requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for regional technical assistance \n(RETA)  for  the  preparation  of  investment  projects  to  strengthen  flood  management  in  their \ncountries.  A  fact-finding  mission  visited  all  four  countries  of  the  Lower  Mekong  Basin  (LMB) \nincluding Thailand2 in April\u2013May 2007 to consult with their key line agencies and national disaster \nmanagement  committees,  National  Mekong  Committees  (NMCs),  and  the  Mekong  River \nCommission Secretariat. The Mission formulated the RETA after reaching understandings with the \ngovernments  on  its  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.3 The  project  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  Mekong  River  is  a  major  influence  on  the  economies  and  lives  of  the  people  in \nCambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Annual floods, which can last for up to 6 months, \nare normally seen as a source of livelihood and sustenance, but droughts, which may persist for \nseveral years, can cause widespread hardship. Flooding rejuvenates wetlands, breeding grounds \nfor aquatic plants, fish, and animals (vital sources of income and food, especially for the poor); \nenriches soil with river-borne sediments and nutrients beneficial to agriculture; and replenishes \nreservoirs and groundwater tables as reserves against water shortages in the dry season. The rise \nand fall of water in the Mekong River determines the cropping cycle, and has given rise to various \nagricultural  systems.  Floods  become  disasters  only  when  they  are  deeper  than  average, \nunexpectedly fast in onset, or unusually prolonged. Droughts, which occur as a result of periods of \nvery low river flow accompanied by poor rainfall, cause severe food shortages. Serious floods in \n2000, 2001, and 2002 caused significant hardship and loss of life, and in high economic costs. The \ndroughts that followed from 2003 to 2005 compounded these impacts. \n \n3.  The four riparian countries of the LMB experience different types of floods. In Cambodia \nand Viet Nam, mainstream floods occur when the Mekong River overflows its banks due to a \ncombination of high river flows from snowmelt in the Himalayas and heavy rainfall produced by the \nsouthwest monsoon  and  by  typhoons  making  landfall  on  the coasts  of central  Viet  Nam  and \nsouthern  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  Mainstream  flooding  takes  place  yearly,  and  inundates \nbetween 26,000 and 45,000 square kilometers of the Cambodian lowlands and Cuu Long Delta for \n3 months or longer.4 Sporadic tributary floods5 occur when the tributaries of the Mekong River \noverflow their banks following intense rainfall during typhoons and tropical storms. A third type of \nflooding that may have increasing significance in the LMB is when water is suddenly released from \na dam, typically in anticipation of an incoming flood (dam-release flooding).  \n                                               \n1  ADB. 2004. Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (RCSP) for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS 2004\u2013\n2008). Manila. The concept paper for the proposed regional technical assistance and investment projects is included in \nthis RCSP. \n2  Thailand was included in the RETA road map studies at the suggestion of the national Mekong committees of all four \nLMB countries. Its participation will ensure that planning and benchmarking for flood and drought mitigation, through \nthe regional roadmap exercise, will be a regionally integrated approach, with the development of common goals, \nstandards, milestones, understandings and programs. Also, Thailand's experience and expertise in flood and drought \nmanagement in recent years will provide many valuable lessons learned. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 June 2007. \n4  Mekong River Commission. 2005. Overview of the Hydrology of the Mekong Basin: Meeting the Needs, Keeping the \nBalance. Vientiane (ISSN: 1728 3248). \n5  Tributary floods are sometimes called \u201cflash floods\u201d because of their sudden and unexpected onset. The intense \nrainfall that causes tributary flooding often also causes \u201clandslips,\u201d which can be significantly more hazardous than \ntributary floods. The term \u201ctributary flood\u201d is taken to include both river flooding and landslips because emergency \nagencies typically have to deal with both disasters at the same time. \n ", "2   \n4.  The annual floods of 2000\u20132002 resulted in 1,300 deaths in Cambodia and Viet Nam (80% \nof them children), caused damage estimated at about $600 million, and disrupted the lives of 10\u2013\n12 million people.6 Although tributary flooding takes place in all four countries, it is most significant \nin Lao PDR7 and Thailand. Tributary floods in 2000\u20132002 in Lao PDR and Thailand took the lives \nof 60\u201380 people and otherwise affected 1\u20132 million others, and caused damage estimated at $30 \nmillion\u2013$50  million.  Badly  regulated  dam  releases  can  also  set  off  floods  downstream  of \nhydropower reservoirs that disrupt lives along the riverbanks and, in extreme cases, cause deaths \nof  people  and  animals.8 Appropriate  rules  should  therefore  be  drawn  up  to  control  reservoir \noperations in the LMB countries, given the anticipated increase in their hydropower use. Current \nresearch predicts that climate change could also lead to more frequent and more severe flooding, \nand raise sea levels at the mouth of the Mekong River. \n5.  Droughts can have just as devastating socioeconomic impact as floods in the LMB.9 The \n2003\u20132005 droughts had a major socioeconomic impact on three of the four riparian countries.10 In \nViet Nam, the yields from more than 10,000 hectares of winter rice in the Cuu Long Delta were \naffected by saltwater intrusion up the Mekong (at a cost of about $60 million); coffee yields in the \nhighlands  dropped;  and  vegetable  gardens  failed,  reducing  the  availability  of  cheap  food.  In \nThailand,  drought  affected  rice  production  on  about  650,000  hectares,  farm  production  costs \nincreased by 40% because of higher water charges and fuel bills, and the water level in the Khorat \nPlateau reservoirs remained critically low. Forecasts of gross domestic product growth in both \nThailand and Viet Nam had to be revised downward as a result of the droughts. In Cambodia, the \ndroughts affected some 500,000 hectares of rice paddy and led to food shortages that affected up \nto 2 million people. On the other hand, in Lao PDR, where almost the entire rural population \ndepends on rainfed rice, the wet seasons began as expected and the impact of the droughts was \nlocal and relatively small. \n6.  The impacts of floods and droughts in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam are \nmagnified because the affected communities are generally poor and vulnerable, and the recurring \ncycles  of  floods  and  droughts  to  some  extent  keep  them that  way.  Helping  these  people  to \nwithstand the negative environmental impact of floods and droughts will improve their standard of \nliving and enable them to climb out of poverty.11  \n7.  Many regional, national, and local initiatives, past and present, in the LMB have been \ncarried  out  to  reduce  the  risk  of  and  vulnerability  to  flood  and  drought.  The  Mekong  River \nCommission (MRC) has begun a major regional flood management and mitigation program (FMMP) \nto improve flood risk management in the four countries of the LMB.12 The World Bank has recently \n                                               \n6  The 2000 flood event was classified as a \u201clarge flood.\u201d It inundated about 45,000 square kilometers of the Cambodian \nlowlands and the Cuu Long Delta in Viet Nam. \n7  Of most concern in the northern areas of Lao PDR is tributary flooding; in the central and southern areas, it is the \ncombination of mainstream and tributary flooding at the confluence of rivers. \n8  In 2000, releases from Yali dam in Viet Nam led to deaths of people in Cambodia. The operating rules have since \nbeen changed and other remedial works are being undertaken.  \n9  Droughts are of three types: meteorological (less than average rainfall over some prescribed period), hydrological (less \nthan average streamflow over some prescribed period), or agricultural (less than average soil water content over some \nprescribed period). Each type has a different socioeconomic impact in the LMB: a meteorological drought can be \ndevastating for annual rainfed crops; a hydrological drought in the Mekong River enables ocean salinity to penetrate \nfurther upstream into the Cuu Long Delta, thereby reducing the amount of land that can be irrigated from the river; and \nan agricultural drought can kill perennial crops. \n10  Mekong  River  Commission.  2005.  Lower  Mekong  Basin  Drought  Study:  Analysis,  Forecasting,  Planning  and \nManagement. Draft Report. \n11  Although originally a flood risk management (FRM) project, the scope was expanded during formulation to include \ndrought risk management (DRM) to recognize the significant negative impact of drought on flood-affected peoples and \non poverty.  DRM interventions will be incorporated where they are consistent with and can be supported alongside \nFRM interventions. \n12  The MRC\u2019s FMMP is a multi-donor-funded program designed to investigate issues, promote best practice, and identify \npotential investment projects for flood management and mitigation in the Lower Mekong Basin. Budgeted at $21.38 \nmillion, the program consists of five components: (i) establishment of a regional FMM center, (ii) planning for the \n ", "  3\nbegun  a  nationwide  program  of  natural  disaster  risk  management  in  Viet Nam.  The  program \nsupports flood risk management (FRM) improvements in the Cuu Long Delta, particularly in the \nforecasting  of  natural  disasters  by  the  Southern  Region  Hydrometeorological  Service,  the \ncollection of hydrometeorological data, and sea-dike construction and reinforcement. A number of \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  all  four  countries  are  training  local  communities  in \nemergency preparedness and response.13 Many activities in water resources management with an \nimpact on flood and drought risks are also ongoing.14 \n8.  There is increasing recognition of the need for both a regional and a national perspective \non FRM, together with appropriate drought risk management (DRM) interventions, to reduce the \nvulnerability of the affected communities. With common benchmarks and targets, all countries in \nthe LMB could define road maps to improve FRM and DRM. The road maps would help align \nprograms and provide a framework for future funding by development partners by identifying gaps \nin current and proposed programs and prioritizing interventions to avoid duplication. This approach \nis consistent with ADB\u2019s disaster and emergency assistance policy,15 which supports activities that \nanticipate  and  mitigate  the  impact  of  disasters,  and  recognizes  the  importance  of  protective \nstrategies that help save lives and safeguard property and resources. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The RETA will improve the ability of communities in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and \nViet Nam to prepare for, respond to, and recover from the negative impact of floods and droughts. \nIt  will  design  separate  investment  projects  for  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.16 Each \ninvestment project will comprise a balanced program of structural and nonstructural measures \nidentified  by  the  country  concerned  to  manage  its  risks  of  flood  and  drought.  Priorities  for \ninvestments will  be  set  through the  preparation  of  one  regional  and  four  national  road maps \n(including Thailand). The RETA will be implemented in close collaboration with the MRC\u2019s FMMP, \nand will use the outputs of that program. The initial poverty and social impact assessment is in \nAppendix 2. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The key activities of the RETA will be to (i) identify and prioritize flood and drought issues \nregionally within the LMB and within in each country through regional and national road maps \ndeveloped to improve flood and drought risk management, (ii) develop a prioritized program of \n                                                                                                                                                          \nimplementation  of  structural  measures  and  flood-proofing,  (iii)  mediation  of  trans-boundary  flood  issues,  (iv) \nstrengthening of flood emergency management, and (v) land management. ADB is contributing $1 million to cofinance \ncomponent  (ii)  under  ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  for  Support  for  the  Mekong  River  Commission  Flood \nManagement and Mitigation Program. Manila (TA 6149-REG, approved December). Component (ii) focuses on \ndeveloping guidelines, tools and techniques for identifying structural and non-structural measures for mitigating the \nimpact of floods, and also developing the capacity to apply these tools, etc. within the MRC and NMCs.  \n13  To learn from NGO experiences in Cambodia ADB recently funded a technical assistance project to formulate a \nmethodology for mobilizing communities in the country to plan, design, and implement flood risk preparedness, \nprevention, and mitigation measures, and to train government staff, NGOs, and leaders to implement the strategy. \n(ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Community Self-Reliance and Flood Risk \nReduction. Manila [TA 4574-CAM, for $500,000, approved in April]) \n14  See, for example, the ADB/World Bank review and assessment of the Mekong region, aimed at developing a Mekong \nwater resources assistance strategy.  \n15  ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila (R71-04). \n16 Indicative investments include $25 million for Cambodia (ADB $20 million, government $5 million) and $80 million for \nViet Nam (ADB $30 million, cofinancing $30 million, and government $20 million) [ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program Update (RCSP) for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS 2007\u20132009)]. A fully cofinanced \ninvestment of $22 million is proposed for Lao PDR ($20 million cofinancing, and $2 million government), [ADB 2007. \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Country Operational Business Plan (2008\u20132010)]. \n ", "4   \nstructural  and  nonstructural  FRM  and  DRM  interventions  in  each  country,  and  (iii)  prepare \nfeasibility studies for proposed investment projects in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam on the \nbasis of the national roadmaps. The RETA will identify target beneficiaries, address regional policy \nand cooperation issues, analyze costs and benefits, and establish implementation arrangements \nfor investment projects for possible funding by ADB or other financiers.  \n11.  Flood and drought risk management is a national responsibility, and each country will have \ndifferent problems and priorities. The RETA will need to coordinate and harmonize with ongoing \nand  proposed  risk  management  initiatives  being  undertaken  by  national  governments  and \ninternational donors. In particular, the RETA will assess the outputs and recommendations from \nthe five components of MRC\u2019s FMMP (footnote 12) and other national and regional initiatives for \nflood and drought risk management, to guide the preparation of the investment projects.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The  total  cost  of  the  RETA  is  estimated  at  $2.5  million  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide \n$2 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The recipient governments will finance a total of $500,000 equivalent by \nproviding  counterpart  staff  and  per  diem  payments,  office  space  for  the  consultants,  data, \nadministration and clerical services, and communications (Appendix 3).17 The governments have \nbeen informed that approval of the RETA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The RETA will be carried out by ADB and implemented by the NMCs in the three countries \n(the Implementing Agencies, or IAs). A no objection letter from each of the governments will be \nobtained before the RETA is implemented in their respective country.  After the RETA feasibility \nstudies, the principal line agency for water resources management in each country is expected to \nassume the role of Executing Agency for the country\u2019s investment projects. The RETA will be \nundertaken over about 24 months, from March 2008 to March 2010. \n14.  Four committees\u2014a regional coordination committee (RCC) and three national steering \ncommittees (NSCs)18\u2014will be created.  \n(i)  The  RCC  will  include  representatives  from  the  NMCs  and  national  disaster \nmanagement committees of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam, as well \nas from MRC (FMMP) and ADB. The regional and national team leaders of the \nRETA consultants will also be members of this committee, which will provide overall \ncoordination and serve as a forum for the discussion of common technical issues19 \nand those of a regional and trans-boundary nature. This committee will meet at least \nfour  times  over  the  RETA  period\u2014once  in  each  country  (including  Thailand), \nchaired by the host country\u2019s IA. 20 \n(ii)  Each  national  steering  committee  (NSC)  will  comprise  representatives  of \nappropriate  line  agencies  and  key  stakeholders,  such  as  the  country\u2019s  NMC, \nnational  disaster  management  committee,  and  river  basin  organizations  (where \nthese exist). The NSC will be chaired by the IA, and will meet at least three times \nduring the RETA, or more often if needed. \n                                               \n17 The governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam will each contribute $150,000 equivalent, and Thailand, \n$50,000 equivalent.  \n18 Activities in Thailand will be coordinated through existing MRC FMMP implementation arrangements. \n19 These include a wide range of basic technical parameters involved in the prediction, management and mitigation of \nfloods and droughts, from sharing and dissemination of flood/drought warnings and climate and hydrological data, \nthrough digital terrain mapping and remote sensing, to socioeconomic and damage-related data collection. \n20 Where possible, the RCC meetings will be held in conjunction with the MRC FMMP Steering Committee Meetings. \n ", "  5\n15.  A technical working group (TWG) will also be formed by  each country. The TWG will \ninclude technical representatives of the line agencies and other key stakeholders and will provide \ntechnical guidance to the consulting teams and assist the NSC in reviewing the outputs of the \nRETA and directing implementation.  \n16.  ADB will recruit an international consulting firm for the RETA studies, and an international \nspecialist  in  flood  and  drought  management  to  assist  ADB  to  implement  the  RETA.  The \ninternational consulting firm will provide four teams of consultants: (i) a regional technical team for \noverall  conceptual  design,  technical  and  capacity  needs  assessment, training  and  awareness \nbuilding  in FRM  and  DRM,  formulation  of  a  regional  road  map  consistent  with  MRC\u2019s  basin \ninitiatives, and overall RETA monitoring and coordination; and (ii) three national project preparation \nteams to prepare national roadmaps and the detailed RETA feasibility studies for Cambodia, Lao \nPDR, and Viet Nam. Before the start of the RETA, the IAs will each appoint a project director, and \nCambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam will appoint a full-time project manager and at least one full-\ntime counterpart member of staff to work with the national project preparation team throughout the \nperiod of assignment.  \n17.  The international consulting firm, together with national consultants, will be hired through \nquality- and cost-based selection (90:10) on the basis of a full technical proposal. About 40 person-\nmonths of international and 56 person-months of national consulting services will be needed in the \nfollowing areas: water resources, flood, drought, and disaster risk management; economics; social \nassessment;  institutional  strengthening;  community  education  and  empowerment;  poverty \nreduction; resettlement; environment; participatory rural appraisal; monitoring and evaluation; and \ngeographic information systems. ADB will also hire an individual international specialist in flood \nand drought management to assist ADB staff in reviewing and managing the RETA for 4 person-\nmonths. Key members of the consulting team will assist ADB during loan fact-finding in each \ncountry. The hiring of consultants will conform to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. All equipment \nto be procured under the RETA will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time) and transferred to the national IA after the Project. \n18.  The regional and national technical teams will each prepare progress reports, a draft final \nreport, and a final report in the ADB format, as well as occasional working papers on specific \nsubjects  as  required.  The  regional  team  reports  will  identify  and  prioritize  regional  flood  and \ndrought issues and present a regional road map. Each national team will identify and prioritize the \ncountry\u2019s flood and drought issues, present a national road map, and prepare feasibility studies for \nthe national investment program. ADB and the governments will review the progress of the RETA \nduring its implementation. Tripartite meetings between the government, ADB, and the national \nproject preparation team will be held in each country at key stages during the RETA, after the \nsubmission of the inception, midterm, and draft final reports. The individual international FRM/DRM \nspecialist will undertake technical reviews of the RETA reports and participate in review missions. \nThe products of the RETA will be posted on ADB\u2019s website and progress will be reported in the \nproject information document on the website. National workshops will be held at key decision \npoints during the RETA, particularly during the preparation of the investment projects, to seek \nfeedback from and disseminate information to key stakeholders.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis for preparing the Greater Mekong \nSubregion Flood and Drought Risk Management and Mitigation Project. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n    Data Sources/   \nDesign  Performance  Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nImproved ability of  \u2022  Preparation and  \u2022  National  \u2022  Support from \ncommunities and  implementation of  statistics on  national, provincial, \ngovernments to prepare  national, district, and  casualties and  and district authorities \nfor, respond to, and  provincial  cost of \nrecover from flood and  preparedness plans  disasters   \u2022  Support from \ndrought events  (by 2014)  nongovernment \n  \u2022  National,  agencies \n\u2022  Improved awareness  provincial, and \nand preparedness in  district budgets  \u2022  Adequate budget \nthe communities   appropriations and \n       (by 2014)  staff resources made \navailable for flood and \n\u2022  Improved ability of  drought risk \ncommunities to cope  management and \nwith floods and  mitigation by national, \ndroughts  provincial, and district \n       (by 2014)  authorities \n\u2022  Integrated and  Risk \nsustainable approach  \u2022  Differences in country \nof government  perspectives on \nagencies to flood and  regional cooperation \ndrought risk  and investment \nmanagement  priorities \n      (by 2014)   \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nAgreed design of the  \u2022  Preparation of draft  \u2022  RETA review  \u2022  Acceptance of \nresulting investment  final reports   missions and  regional road map \nprojects for Cambodia,        (by September 2009)  project \nLao PDR, and    progress  \u2022  Adoption of national \nViet Nam    reports  road maps \n   \n\u2022  Agreement on \nprioritized list of \ninterventions \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how \nthe project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction \nstrategy of the partner country. \n \n  ADB\u2019s GMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (2004\u20132008) supports pro-poor, sustainable growth \nthrough, among other things, capability-building measures to address human resource development needs, and \nshared management of the environment and natural resources\u2014especially the watershed systems of the Mekong \nRiver\u2014to help ensure sustainable development and conservation. ADB\u2019s GMS strategy is intended to accelerate the \nachievement of the MDGs through support for economic growth objectives to reduce income poverty, and through \ninvestments and technical assistance to promote efficient policy choices that will reduce non-income poverty. One of \nthe  11  \u201cGMS  flagship  programs\u201d  specifically  addresses  flood  control  and  water  management.  It  involves \nstrengthening land-use planning in the GMS countries to reduce risk to people living in hazardous floodplain areas, \nstrengthening structural measures to reduce damage from floods, strengthening institutional capacity for flood \npreparedness and emergency management, and financing works and other measures to minimize the damage \ncaused by floods in the region. \n \n  The negative impact of floods in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam is magnified by the limited economic \ncapacity of those affected to deal with such events. The affected communities are generally poor and vulnerable, and \nto some extent are kept that way by recurring flood and drought. Reducing the vulnerability of these people to the \nnegative economic impact of floods and droughts will improve their standard of living and help them climb out of \npoverty. \n \n \nB.    Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1,  \n                           M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n The Project is classified as a general intervention as it will have a regional focus, albeit directed at the areas of \nthe Lower Mekong Basin that are most affected by flood and drought. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1. If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2. What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \n A social specialist/sociologist will be part of the consulting team and will address social, poverty, indigenous \npeoples, and gender issues.  \n3. If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n  As noted, the affected communities are generally poor and vulnerable, and to some extent are kept that way by \nthe cycles of flood and drought. Pro-poor design will be a key feature of this PPTA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA. Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? \n  The rural poor are the primary beneficiaries of this project since the negative impact of floods in Cambodia, Lao \nPDR, and Viet Nam is magnified by the limited economic capacity of the affected peoples to deal with such events. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n          In addition to assisting national, regional, and local authorities in managing floods, the RETA will identify \ncommunity-based flood and drought risk management (CBFDRM) activities to mitigate the impact of these natural \ndisasters.  Typical  CBFDRM  activities  are surveys  of  key  flood  and  drought  risk issues  in  the  villages;  risk \nmanagement planning for villages; implementation of local structural measures in villages (e.g., embankments, safe \nrefuges, water tanks); improvement of access to education, health/medical facilities, shops, veterinary supplies, etc., \nduring floods; and conduct of educational activities such as hazard reduction programs for children. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \n  Institutional, capacity, and financial constraints, as well as lack of access to information about floods and \ndroughts, are key constraints on flood and drought risk management. The Project will identify the national, regional, \nand local constraints, as well as key initiatives to deal with these issues. \nB. Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \nThe rural poor are the primary beneficiary stakeholders of the Project, as indicated in Section A.1. Other \nstakeholders  are  national  disaster  management  organizations,  local  government  units,  NGOs,  civil  society \norganizations and relief agencies, the Mekong River Commission, and development partners. \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \n  Stakeholder analysis and participation in the preparation of regional and national road maps for flood and \ndrought risk management and mitigation are key features of the project design. The consultations with national, \nprovincial, district, and community stakeholders will continue throughout the design phase of the country investment \nprojects to ensure that the proposed investments are appropriately targeted and address the needs of the vulnerable \ncommunities. \n \n3. What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n Empowerment is a key to the success of CBFDRM activities in mitigating these natural disasters, as described \nin Section A.2. \n \n4. Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n The planning of workshops to be conducted during the RETA will be a key activity in the inception phase. \n \nC. Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n  The concerns and needs of women and children are central to the development of CBFDRM strategies, and will \nbe specifically addressed during the design of the country activities in these areas. The key gender issues are related \nto how families (men, women, and children) cope with natural disasters such as floods and droughts.  \n2.Does  the  proposed  project/program  have  the  potential  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?      Yes          No    Please explain.  \nThe Project is intended to address disaster mitigation, and, while addressing gender issues (as described in \nitem 1 above), is unlikely to promote gender equality. \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No    Please explain.  \nFor the reasons given in item 2 above, the Project is unlikely to have an adverse impact on women and girls or to \nwiden gender inequality. \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \nIII.
