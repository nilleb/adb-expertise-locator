The government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has requested the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  to  provide  support  by  lending  for  the  proposed  Integrated  Information \nCommunications and Technology Development Project.1  \n \n2.  Firstly, the integrated development of information and communications technology (ICT) \nsector is crucial for Pakistan to attain overall inclusive and sustainable development goals as \nenvisaged in Pakistan Vision 2025.2 By 2025, 63% of Pakistan\u2019s population will be below the age \nof 30. To maximize the demographic dividend, investments in human development in growth \nsectors of economy is crucial. Further, to channelize the younger generation towards increasing \nproductivity, Pakistan needs to create required number of jobs by adopting high gross domestic \nproduct growth strategies. This requires robust development of ICT sector. Also, in the United \nNations (UN) 2016 e-Government Development Index, Pakistan ranks 159 amongst 193 countries. \nThis index reflects the measure of e-government development in UN member states. Pakistan \nalso ranks 114 in UN e-Participation index for 2016, which measures the extent of electronic \nengagement of the government with its citizens and other stakeholders. To improve access and \nefficient reach of public service delivery, Pakistan should develop agile ICT capabilities.  \n \n3.  Secondly, the ICT industry is rapidly changing. Automation of ICT-enabled services are \nbeing adopted across economies. Machine to machine communications and automated decision \nmaking capabilities are increasingly being used. These changes are enabled by improvements in \nICT\u2019s  artificial  intelligence,  internet-of-things,  augmented  reality,  big  data  analytics,  cloud \ncomputing, and micro-electronics disciplines. A systematic program to incorporate these new \nadvancements in higher education stream in Pakistan is urgently needed to prepare the future \nworkforce employment ready and relevant. This is also needed for Pakistan to be competitively \nrelevant and remain a serious player in ICT sector in the region. Pakistan did not realize the \nbenefits of IT revolutions of 90\u2019s and 2000\u2019s due to lack of focus in adoption of high technology \nskills development programs. It is important for Pakistan to develop capabilities required for the \nfourth industrial revolution that is taking roots now. The fourth industrial revolution is predicted to \nbe dominated by new age ICTs mentioned above. \n \n4.  Thirdly, to energize the less dominant private players of ICT sector, Pakistan should \nfinetune its policy environments, facilities, and capacity development programs. Currently, the \nprivate sector is facing problems such as inadequate space, secured environment, and access to \naffordable high speed internet connections. Because of absence of an enabling environment, the \nICT sector in Pakistan largely rest in the realms of small and medium enterprise sections. To \nrealize higher export potential, along with small and medium enterprises, Pakistan must strive to \nattract heavy weight ICT companies across the globe. The present status of ICT industry in \nPakistan can largely be attributed to the classic market failure bracket which warrants massive \ninfusion of public sector intervention during these initial stages. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n1 The project is listed in the draft country operations business plan, 2018-2020, for Pakistan dated 11 September 2017. \n2 Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission. 2014.

The proposed project will support the government to adopt a long-term strategy and \nimplementation framework for the reinvigoration of ICT sector and smart city solutions to allow \nholistic development of IT ecosystem, through the establishment of a benchmark model IT park \nin Pakistan. The investment is also in line with the government\u2019s mid-term IT development policy, \nthe Digital Pakistan Policy 2017.3 The project will contribute to higher and more inclusive growth \nthrough integrated adoption of ICT solutions in Pakistan. The expected outcome of the project is \nstrengthened holistic development of ICT sector in Pakistan. The outcome will be achieved \nthrough the following outputs: (i) an IT park set up as a benchmark model in Karachi; (ii) National \nIT Parks strategy developed; (iii) smart city strategy developed and piloted; and (iv) ICT skills in \nhigher  education  stream  with  technological  readiness  for  knowledge-based  economy \nstrengthened. The project will be aligned with the following impact: ICT industry contribution to \ninclusive growth increased, as outlined in Pillar VI of Pakistan Vision 2025.4 \n \nC.  Proposed Financing Plans and Modality  \n6.  The total cost of the project is estimated at $250 million, of which $200 million will be \nfinanced by ADB through a loan from its regular ordinary capital resources, as outlined in Table \n1. The federal government of Islamic Republic of Pakistan will finance the cost of land, taxes, and \nduties. The project modality is a project loan. \n \nTable 1: Indicative Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total  \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  200.00  80 \nGovernment  50.00  20 \n  Total    250.00  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nD.

A transaction technical assistance (TRTA) is required to complete due diligence for the \nensuing project. Ministry of Information and Technology & Telecom (MOIT) is in possession of \nland in Karachi to construct the benchmark model IT Park. Necessary policy impetus for such \nparks and smart governance solutions in Pakistan are already outlined in the updated IT Policy \nof 2017. The Government has requested ADB to support its efforts to rejuvenate the ICT sector \nof the country. The Ministry has initiated institutional arrangements such as establishment of \nResearch and Development fund for ICT. The government is engaging in a bilateral manner with \nthe government of People\u2019s Republic of China and is strengthening high speed infrastructure \ncapacity by undertaking development of landing gateways in the north and laying of fiber optic \ncable linkage systems. The TRTA will leverage the governmental commitment and ownership, \nand feasibility-level designs will be prepared for the three components. In addition, financial and \neconomic analysis, poverty and social impact assessments, assessments of financial and/or \nprocurement management capacity, and project\u2019s safeguard arrangements in terms of both \nenvironment and social, in line with ADB requirements, will be prepared.5 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n9.  Output 1: An IT park set up as a benchmark model in Karachi. The output will support \nthe establishment of an IT park along with ancillary facilities such as incubators and accelerators. \nThis  will  enable  end-to-end  activities  between  the  industry,  academia,  and  government  in \nincreasing high value added jobs and economic activities. \n \n10.
