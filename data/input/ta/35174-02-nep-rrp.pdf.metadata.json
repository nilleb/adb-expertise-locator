Three subprograms were envisioned in accordance \nwith the time frame and progress of SSR from 2007 onward. The \nESP subprogram I, approved on 1 December 2006, supports the \nNepal Education for All (EFA) program (2004\u20132009) for basic and \nprimary  education  (grades  1\u20135)  with  a  program  loan  for  $30 \nmillion from FY2007 to FY2009. A capacity development grant of \n$2  million  complements  the  ESP  subprogram  I  to  develop \ngovernment stakeholders\u2019 capacity in policy analysis, formulation, \nand coordination. It also supports the preparation of an SSR core \ndocument.  The  ESP  subprogram  II,  approved  on  24  January \n2008,  supports  the  preparation  and  transition  to  SSR  from \nFY2008 to FY2011, in particular a model-building exercise of the \nbasic education extension to grades 1\u20138 in a few districts, as well \nas broad capacity development for system readiness. \nThe ESP subprogram III is proposed to support the Government \nin the implementation of the SSR program from 2009 onward. \nSubprogram III will cover the period from FY2010 to FY2012, \nduring which the Government will focus on the implementation of \nbasic education restructuring, while model building activities will \nbe initiated for secondary education and technical education and \nvocational training (TEVT). \n   \nRationale  Overall, Nepal has been successful in steadily improving access \nto  education  at  all  levels  while  narrowing  gender  and  social \ndisparities  in  enrollment.  However,  further  effort  is  needed  to \nimprove the quality of education. High repetition and dropout rates \nindicate low internal efficiency of the education system. The needs \n ", "ii \n \nof the most disadvantaged groups also need to be addressed \nfurther. The education divide persists between urban, rural, and \nremote areas as well as between children from well-off and less \nwell-off families. \nThe Government of Nepal has a high commitment to education. A \nkey national priority is to increase equity in access to education, \nwhile social inclusion is a central approach to reduce disparities in \neducation  in  terms  of  gender,  caste,  and  ethnicity.  The \ndecentralization of school management responsibilities to school \nmanagement  committees,  and  community  participation  in \neducation  are  at  the  center  of  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to \nimprove the quality and efficiency of education. To achieve the \nEFA goals, the Government launched the Nepal EFA Program \n(2004\u20132009),  a  high-priority  program  for  basic  and  primary \neducation supported by 14 development partners, including the \nADB.  The  EFA  program  has  substantially  contributed  to \nimprovements in education sector outcomes. In addition, it has \nmade  progress  in  implementation  strategies  such  as \ndecentralization,  capacity  development,  financial  management, \nand institutional harmonization. \nTo  build  on  the  achievements  of  EFA,  and  address  some  of \nremaining  shortcomings  and  constraints,  the  Government  has \ndeveloped  the  SSR  program.  The  SSR  program  envisions  a \ntransition  from  the  current  subsector  approach,  with  education \nfinanced by programs such as EFA and the Secondary Education \nSupport Program (SESP), to an integrated SSR program. It aims \nto restructure the primary and secondary school system into an \nintegrated  grade  1\u201312  system  in  a  phased  manner.  The \nGovernment recognizes that 5 years of basic education is not \nsufficient  and  intends  to  extend  basic  education  coverage  to \ngrades 1\u20138 and integrate secondary education into grades 9\u201312. \nThe Government also intends to improve synergies between basic \neducation and secondary education to achieve a more holistic \napproach  to  school  education.  The  SSR  program  is  partly  a \ncontinuation of earlier programs such as EFA and the SESP, and \npartly the beginning of new reforms characterized by strategic \ninterventions  such  as  restructuring  of  school  education,  and \nimprovement of the quality and efficiency of education. Through \nthe  implementation  of  these  reform  agendas  and  specific \ninterventions, the Government aims to address the 8% of children \n(aged  5\u20139)  currently  out  of  school,  and  the  high  dropout  and \nrepetition  rates  at  primary  level.  Achieving  sustainable \nimprovements in learning achievement levels and improving the \ncost-efficiency and effectiveness of its services also constitute a \nmajor focus in the SSR program. The expected outcome of the \nSSR program is a more equitable, inclusive, effective, and holistic \neducation system. The SSR program spans 7 years, from FY2010 \nto FY2016.  \n   \n ", "iii \nImpact and Outcome  The expected overall impact of the ESP cluster program, including \nthe ESP subprogram III, is enhanced educational attainment and \nlivelihood  for  all  children,  particularly  girls  and  disadvantaged \ngroups.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  ESP  subprogram  III  is \nincreased access to and quality of school education, particularly \nbasic  education  (grades  1\u20138),  especially  for  girls  and  children \nfrom marginalized groups. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The SSR program cost is estimated at $2.62 billion for the first 5 \nyears of the SSR program period. The SSR program cost includes \nall  regular  recurrent  and  investment  costs  for  operating  the \nsubsectors  covered  under  the  SSR  program,  as  well  as  the \nadditional costs associated with the SSR reform. The currently \nprojected available funding over the same period is estimated at \n$2.26 billion, excluding ADB's proposed assistance.  \nIt is proposed that under subprogram III, a grant of $70 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and a loan equivalent to \n$25 million in special drawing rights from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources be provided. The loan will have an amortization period \nof 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of \n1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n   \nProgram Period and  The  ESP  subprogram  III  will  support  the  SSR  program  from \nTranching  FY2010 to FY2012. The program period will be from August 2009 \nto July 2012. It is expected that program completion will be in \nJuly 2012 and the closing date will be December 2012. The grant \nand loan will be released in two tranches of $45 million (tranche 1) \nand $50 million (tranche 2). The first tranche will be released upon \nfulfilling all first tranche release conditions. The second tranche is \nexpected to be released within 18 months of the release of the \nfirst,  subject  to  compliance  with  second  tranche  release \nconditions. The first tranche will be disbursed fully from the grant \nresources.  The  second  tranche  will  be  a  combination  of  the \nbalance  of  the  grant  resources  ($25  million)  and  the  loan \n($25 million). \n   \nImplementation  The  ESP  subprogram  III  will  follow  the  program  management \nArrangements  arrangements specified in the revised joint financing arrangement \n(JFA) for SSR. The JFA details the goals of the SSR program; the \nresponsibilities of the Government and the development partners; \nthe  funding  mechanism;  and  fiduciary  requirements,  including \nprocurement,  reporting,  monitoring  and  auditing,  and  other \nadministrative requirements. The JFA development partners meet \nregularly  to  review  the  financial  and  operational  status  and \nprogress of SSR and to commit and disburse funds. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Education (MOE) is the Executing Agency and the \nDepartment of Education (DOE) is the Implementing Agency.  \n   \n ", "iv \n \nProcurement and  The  grant  and  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full \nDisbursement  foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. No supporting import documentation will be \nrequired if, during each year that grant and loan proceeds are \nexpected to be disbursed, the value of total imports minus imports \nfrom  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance, is equal to \nor greater than the amount of the grant and loan expected to be \ndisbursed  during  such  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its \ncompliance  with  this  formula  with  its  withdrawal  request.  ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of grant and loan proceeds and \nverify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. Procurement \nof eligible items and recruitment of consultants will be on the basis \nof standard government procurement and recruitment practices \nacceptable  to  ADB  for  procurement  and  recruitment  by  the \nGovernment or its representatives. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  local  currency  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the \nprogram  grant  and  loan  will  be  used  by  the  Government  to \nsupplement the cost associated with implementation of the SSR \nprogram. \n   \nProgram Benefits and  The  Program  is  expected  to  generate  substantial  economic \nBeneficiaries  benefits. Three distinct economic benefits can be identified as a \npotential  result  of  the  SSR  program:  (i)  increased  access  to \neducation, resulting in more workers in the future with at least \n8 years  of  schooling  and  with  higher  earnings  as  a  result; \n(ii) enhanced education quality and relevance, resulting in higher \nproductivity  and  earnings  on  the  part  of  everyone  who  has \ncompleted basic education; and (iii) improvement in the education \nsystem\u2019s internal efficiency. The Program will benefit the children \nand  youth  of  Nepal,  in  particular  girls  and  children  from \ndisadvantaged communities. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  SSR  program  is  a  comprehensive  program  for  the \nGovernment. It requires the commitment of substantial financial \nresources.  Macroeconomic  stability  and  sustained  economic \ngrowth  are  crucial  for  the  Government  to  be  able  to  allocate \nsufficient recurrent budget to education. Particularly in the current \nmacroeconomic environment, funding for education should not be \ncompromised. The Government has accorded high priority to the \neducation  sector  and  has  committed  to  ensure  that  adequate \nfunding will continue to be allocated to the SSR program.  \nPolitical stability is important for the success of the SSR program. \nWhile the scope for a more conducive political environment has \nimproved  since  the  end  of  the  conflict,  peace  building  and \nreconstruction continue to be a fragile process that entails political \nrisks. The achievements of the school system and the successful \n ", "v \nimplementation  of  the  previous  education  programs  have \ndemonstrated  the  resilience  of  the  education  system  in \nchallenging political circumstances in the past. \nContinuous efforts are required to ensure that program funds are \nused  appropriately.  Nepal\u2019s  overall  fiduciary  risk  level  remains \nhigh. In this respect, the SSR program has adopted the additional \ncontrol  mechanisms  introduced  under  the  JFA  to  reduce  the \noverall risk to an acceptable level. Governance measures have \nbeen further strengthened with the adoption of the Governance \nAccountability and Action Plan, agreed to by the Government and \ndevelopment partners pooling funds through the JFA.  \nAs  the  SSR  is  a  major  reform  program,  some  resistance  to \nchange from within the system, as well as outside the system, \ncould be expected. This risk has been mitigated throughout the \ndesign process by seeking wide stakeholder feedback and inputs, \nand the process is supported at a high political level with cabinet \napproval of the SSR core document.  \n   \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nincrease in the program cluster amount, (ii) a proposed grant, and (iii) a proposed loan, all to \nNepal for subprogram III of the Education Sector Program (ESP).  \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONTEXT \n2.  Nepal, with per capita income of about $447 (FY2009), is the poorest country in South \nAsia. Key development challenges include widespread poverty (31% in 2004) and high income \ninequality (Gini coefficient of 41.1% in 2004).  \n3.  Nepal\u2019s  recent  economic  development  has  been  modest.  The  difficult  political \nenvironment for reforms and development activities resulted in annual average gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth of 4.1% during FY2004\u2013FY2009. This growth was underpinned by a \ngenerally stable macroeconomic situation. The improved security situation after 2006 mainly \nbenefited the growth of services, which surpassed the relatively slow growth in agriculture and \nindustries. The fiscal deficit was contained, at an average of 1.5% of GDP over FY2004\u2013\nFY2009, while strong remittances inflow and tourism receipts helped maintain a surplus current \naccount  throughout  the  period,  except  in  FY2007.  Overall  average  inflation  over  FY2004\u2013\nFY2009 was at about 7%.  \n4.  Aided by the improved security situation, overall GDP growth increased from 3.3% in \nFY2007 to 5.3% in FY2008, but slowed down to 4.7% in FY2009. Given its limited exposure to \nthe global financial system, the global economic slowdown is expected to have limited impact on \nNepal. However, some impact may be inevitable on exports, remittances, tourism receipts, and \nexternal assistance, especially if the global recession is prolonged. In view of this, GDP growth \nis forecast to slow further to 3.5% in FY2010. Average consumer inflation jumped up to 13% in \nFY2009 from 7.7% a year earlier.  \n5.  Improved revenue mobilization helped contain the budget deficit at 1.9% of GDP in \nFY2009 despite a surge in expenditure. Total spending swelled by 15%, mainly because of the \npeace process, resulting in an improved project implementation environment. Total revenue \ngrew robustly by 18% in FY2009 supported by stronger tax administration. It increased to 18% \nof GDP, a  gain of about 2.7 percentage points from a year earlier. Continued successful \nimprovements in revenue collection and sustained support from development partners will be \nthe key to maintaining macroeconomic stability.  \n6.  On the political front, the end of the conflict in 2006 and the improved security situation \nhave opened up the \u201cdevelopment space,\u201d facilitating revival of development activities. The \npeace process has since progressed, with orderly conduct of the historic Constituent Assembly \nelection  in  April  2008  and  the  installation  of  an  elected  coalition  government  led  by  the \nCommunist Party of Nepal (Maoist) in August 2008. However, the fragility of the democratic \nprocess was proven by the quickly deteriorating situation following a political standoff with \nrespect to the integration of soldiers. Following the withdrawal of key coalition partners, the \nPrime Minister resigned on 4 May 2009. A new coalition government led by the Communist \nParty of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) was subsequently formed. Without the support of the \nCommunist Party of Nepal (Maoist), the inclusiveness of the political process remains limited.  \n7.  A key mandate of the new government is to facilitate drafting a new and more inclusive \nconstitution that will also define the structure and substance of a new federal republic state, the \ndecision on which was taken by the first session of the 601-member Constituent Assembly in \nMay 2008, abolishing the centuries-old monarchy. The process has begun but progress has \nbeen impeded by some major political hitches. The constitution drafting process involves the \ndaunting task of addressing deep-rooted and divisive issues of ethnicity, regionalism, caste, and \n ", "2 \n \ngender.  The  Constituent  Assembly  is  determined  to  finalize  drafting  the  constitution  by \nMay 2010, but a delay is expected because of the recent change in government. After approval \nof  the  new  constitution,  national  political  elections  will  be  held,  followed  by  local  political \nelections.  \n8.  Pending finalization of the state restructuring process, further reform measures in the \ndecentralization process are unlikely. There are currently no elected local government bodies \nbut they may be formed as an interim measure after some understanding between major \npolitical parties is reached.  \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  \n9.  The  current  education  system  of  Nepal  consists  of  preschool  and  early  childhood \neducation and development (ECED), 5 years of primary education (grades 1\u20135), 3 years of \nlower  secondary  education  (grades  6\u20138),  2  years  of  secondary  education  (grades  9\u201310), \n2 years of higher secondary education (grades 11\u201312), technical education and vocational \ntraining (TEVT), tertiary education, and adult literacy (Appendix 2). A school leaving certificate \n(SLC) is awarded by a national examination at the end of grade 10, and a high school leaving \ncertificate (HSLC) is awarded at the end of grade 12.  \n10.  Broadly, schools are categorized into four types: (i) community-aided (public schools that \nare fully supported by the Government for teachers\u2019 salaries and other operational costs), \n(ii) community-managed  (public  schools  that  are  fully  supported  by  the  Government  for \nteachers\u2019 salaries and operational costs but whose management responsibility is undertaken by \nthe community), (iii) community-unaided (public schools that are either receiving partial support \nor no support from the Government), and (iv) institutional schools (private schools supported \nentirely by parents and trustees). In addition to these categories, religious schools such as \nMadarsa (Islamic), Gumba (Buddhist), and Gurukul (Hindu), offer mostly primary education.  \n11.  At  central  level,  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  is  responsible  for  overall  policy \ndevelopment, planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the education sector. Under MOE, school \neducation is administered by the Department of Education (DOE), through District Education \nOffices (DEOs) in the 75 districts. DEOs are responsible for ensuring the flow of funds to \nschools for salaries as well as distribution of provisions such as textbooks and teacher training \nactivities.  At  the  community  level,  school  management  committees  (SMCs)\u2014composed  of \nrepresentatives from parents, community members, and school administrators\u2014play significant \nroles in the management of the school. In the case of community-managed schools, SMCs also \ntake  responsibility  for  the  recruitment  and  management  of  teachers  as  well  as  resource \nmobilization. Higher secondary education is managed separately under the Higher Secondary \nEducation Board, while administration of TEVT is under the responsibility of the Council for \nTechnical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT). \n12.  Participation in education has expanded at all levels, resulting in substantial growth of \nthe education system. In 2008, the gross enrollment rate (GER) for ECED reached 63.4%. \nThe percentage of grade 1 students with ECED experience was up to 36.2% in 2008 from \n8.0% in 2001. As primary education enrollment has reached 91.9% and primary completion has \nreached about 76%, demand for postprimary education has increased. From 2001 to 2008, the \nnet enrollment rate (NER) for primary education rose from 81.0% to 91.9%. The NER for lower \nsecondary education grew from 42.9% to 52.3%, while the NER for secondary education grew \nfrom 29.5% to 34.7% from 2001 to 2008. The NER for higher secondary education was 11% in \n2008.  \n ", "  3 \n13.  Nepal  has  managed  to  achieve  overall  enrollment  increases,  accompanied  by  a \nreduction in gender, caste and ethnic disparity. The Gender Parity Index for the primary NER \nshows a steady improvement from 0.60 in 2001 to 0.97 in 2008. Girls represent 49.5% of \nprimary enrollment, 48.2% of lower secondary enrollment, and 47.2% of secondary enrollment \nin 2008. Data indicate that the enrollment of Dalits1 and Janajatis2 has increased substantially \nover the past 5 years\u2014the enrollment of Dalits has increased from 600,000 in 2003 to \nalmost 1 million in 2008, while the enrollment of Janajatis has increased from less than 1 \nmillion in 2003 to almost 2 million in 2008, both with near gender parity. Incentive payments, \nin addition to the provision of free primary education to overcome the opportunity costs of \neducation, have been perceived as having made an impact on the access of girls, Dalits, and \ndisadvantaged Janajatis. \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n14.  Overall, Nepal has been successful in steadily improving access to education at all \nlevels while narrowing gender and social disparities in enrollment. However, indications of poor \nlearning outcomes suggest that considerable effort is needed to improve the quality of education. \nHigh repetition and dropout rates indicate low internal efficiency of the education system. The \nneeds of the most disadvantaged groups also need to be addressed further. The education \ndivide persists between urban, rural, and remote areas as well as between children from well-off \nand less well-off families. \n15.  Quality.  Student  achievement  in  primary  and  lower  secondary  education  is  weak.  \nComparison between a national assessment conducted in 2008 and a previous assessment in \n1999 shows continued weakness in mathematics and English, relative strength in social studies, \nand a decline in Nepali mean scores. The 2008 national assessment showed that grade 5 \nstudents  master  less  than  half  the  material  specified  in  the  curriculum  framework\u2019s \nspecifications  grid  for  each  grade  and  subject  area\u201416%  of  the  sampled  schools  had \nachievement levels below 30%. It further found significant variations between students from \ndifferent  socioeconomic  and  ethnic  groups,  indicating  that  the  education  system  did  not \ncompensate for differences in geographical, social, and economic backgrounds.  \n16.  Key constraints to better quality education include the following: \n(i)  Lack  of  teachers.  Teacher  numbers  have  been  increasing  but  student \nenrollments have more than kept pace, so the overall primary student\u2013teacher \nratio  is  higher  in  2008  (44:1)  than  in  2003  (40:1).  This  has  resulted  in \novercrowded  classrooms  in  some  areas.  It  is  estimated  that  about \n19,300 additional teachers are needed to achieve the desired student\u2013teacher \nratio in primary education. \n(ii)  Lack of teacher training. Only 66% of primary teachers and 77% of secondary \nteachers possess the required qualifications and training.  \n(iii)  Lack of grasp of new teaching methodologies. While there are more teachers \nand more trained teachers, the effort required to change classroom processes \nhas seemingly been underestimated and these remain unsatisfactory in many \nschools.  The  potential  of  an  inclusive,  child-friendly  approach  to  enable  any \nschool to include the vast majority of children in its catchment area has been \nrecognized by some stakeholders. \n(iv)  Lack of teacher supervision. Supervision is one of the weaker links in the \nschool management system in Nepal. The Technical Review of School Education \n                                                 \n1  Historically disadvantaged occupational caste group. \n2  Ethnic minority group.  \n ", "4 \n \n20053 reported minimal supervision and monitoring visits by resource persons \nand school supervisors. The average visit of resource persons to the schools \nsampled  by  the  review  was  less  than  once  in  a  6-month  period,  although \nresource persons are supposed to visit the schools once a month. \n17.  Efficiency. Improving the internal efficiency of the public school system, especially in \nthe early grades of primary education, remains a challenge. The grade 1 gross intake rate (GIR) \nwas  148%  in  2008,  reflecting  substantial  underage  and  overage  enrollment.  This  creates \novercrowding of classrooms and impedes the pedagogical process. In turn, it becomes a factor \nfor high repetition and dropout rates. Repetition rates have decreased by 9 percentage points \nover the past decade but by only 3\u20134 percentage points since 2005. Rates overall do not vary \nsignificantly for girls and boys. Repetition in grade 1 continues to be higher compared to higher \ngrades, although the repetition rate in grade 1 has fallen from 39% in 2001 to 28% in 2008. The \nsurvival rate to grade 5 was 73%, and the transition rate to lower secondary was 77% in 2008. \nHigh GIRs, and repetition and dropout rates contribute to overall low efficiency of education \ndelivery. In basic education, it currently takes on average 11.5 student-years to complete the 8-\nyear education course. SLC pass rates for students from community schools have ranged from \n25% to 60% over the past decade. However, only 51% of public school students in 2007 passed \nSLC examinations as opposed to 90% of private school students \n18.  Equity of access. There have been improvements in equity of access but gender, \ncaste, and ethnic disparities in enrollment increase with the level of education. Poverty remains \na  major  barrier  in  access  to  education  for  the  most  disadvantaged  groups.  Performance, \nparticularly of the Dalits, needs attention as their pass and promotion rates are below average. \nGender and socioeconomic gaps widen markedly in the transition from grade 5 to lower \nsecondary.  In  addition,  geographic  inequalities  in  provision  remain\u2014schools  serving  the \npoorest and most marginalized communities are the least well staffed, resourced, or supported. \nTo address these issues, a recently conducted evaluation study4 of the primary Education for All \n(EFA) program recommended to simplify further and sharpen scholarship schemes and criteria, \nwhile  continuing  to  keep  all  types  of  basic  education  free  of  direct  fees  and  costs.  The \nevaluation study also recommended that additional funding should be targeted to disadvantaged \nschools for locally relevant strategies to address the opportunity costs of education. \n19.  Teacher  management.  Uneven  deployment  of  government  teachers,  the  need  for \nquality enhancement of teachers, a shortfall in resources whereby government resources do not \nfully cover teachers' salaries, and teacher absenteeism are key challenges related to teacher \nmanagement. Teachers play an important role in improving the quality of education and quality \nimprovements can only be sought with an adequately sized teacher-force, with teachers who \nare  well-trained,  and  committed  to  improving  the  learning  outcomes  of  children  in  their \nclassrooms.  \n20.  Subsector-specific  constraints.  In  ECED,  investments  have  not  yet  resulted  in \nincreased efficiency by reducing underage enrollments in grade 1 and lowering repetition rates \nin early grades. Moreover, ECED services fail to cater to the most excluded groups because \nECED centers are concentrated in relatively developed areas. In secondary education, financing \nconstitutes a major challenge. The Interim Constitution of 2007 states that free secondary \neducation will be provided by the state. However, secondary schools collect tuition at present \nand budgetary space does not allow fulfilling the aspirations of the constitution. Furthermore, \nteacher shortages negatively affect the quality of secondary education and create a barrier to \n                                                 \n3  MOE. 2005.

Oslo. \n ", "  5 \nexpansion of access to secondary education. Higher secondary education suffers from poor \ncoordination with secondary education, and integration of higher secondary education with the \nschool system has been slow for institutional reasons and because of limited government \ninvolvement.  \nC.  The Government\u2019s Strategy \n1.  Education for All Program \n21.  The Government has a high commitment to education, as reflected in successive Five-\nyear plans5 and the Three-Year Interim Plan (FY2008\u2013FY2010).6 A key national priority is to \nincrease  equity  in  access  to  education.  Social  inclusion  is  a  central  approach  to  reduce \ndisparities in education in terms of gender, caste, and ethnicity. The decentralization of school \nmanagement responsibilities to SMCs, and community participation in education are at the \ncenter of the Government\u2019s strategy to improve the quality and efficiency of education. In 2000, \nNepal joined the global EFA movement.7 The national plan of action for EFA 2015 was drawn \nup with the vision of achieving quality basic and primary education for all by 2015. To achieve \nthe EFA goals, the Government launched the Nepal EFA Program (2004\u20132009),8 a high-priority \nprogram for basic and primary education supported by 14 development partners, including the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). Three objectives were identified: (i) ensuring access and \nequity in primary education; (ii) enhancing the quality and relevance of primary education; and \n(iii) improving  efficiency  and  institutional  capacity.  The  EFA  program  has  substantially \ncontributed to sector outcomes in primary education. Appendix 3 reports progress on key EFA \noutcome  indicators.  It  has  also  made  progress  in  implementation  strategies  such  as \ndecentralization, capacity development, financial management, and institutional harmonization. \n22.  Decentralization. The most significant progress has been in revitalizing SMCs and \nhanding schools back to be managed by communities. Implementation of the program has \nsteadily passed to the districts, and schools, for implementation. The program has made good \nprogress toward the target of having 8,000 schools managed by communities. However, many \nschools remain under DEO management since their resource base and local leadership does \nnot provide the conditions for self-management. SMCs need to be made more functional to \nensure successful handover. Moving forward, it is necessary to enhance the capacity of SMCs \nand resources, corresponding with their responsibilities, and to explore ways of ensuring that \nthe composition of the SMC is representative and that individual members serve students\u2019 best \ninterests. \n23.  Capacity development. Efforts to develop capacity have largely focused on the central \nlevel  and  have  resulted  in  improved  capacity  to  implement  the  program.  Planning  and \nownership  have  improved  during  implementation  of  the  program.  Central  planning  and \nmanagement, reporting, the education management information system and Flash Reports,9 \nand  decentralized  planning  have  all  improved\u2014as  has  the  quality  of  the  annual  strategic \nimplementation plan (ASIP), annual work plan and budget (AWPB), and the semiannual EFA \nprogress reports.

Flash Reports cover enrollment, pass rates of students, repetition \nand survival rates, training status of teachers, supply of textbooks and learning materials. \n ", "6 \n \nthe Government. However, linkages with lower governance levels remain weak. EFA expanded \nthe concept of school improvement plans (SIPs), introduced under the government's Basic and \nPrimary Education Program II. SIPs intended to introduce a bottom\u2013up approach in education \nplanning and were envisioned as tools for \u201cimproving access, quality and management of \neducational processes at the school and community levels\u201d (footnote 4). The SIP process was \nalso \u201ca planning mechanism to prioritize schools\u2019 human, material and financial resources to \nachieve the optimum possible outcomes\u201d (footnote 4). It was envisaged that the SIP would be \nthe basic building material for village, municipal and district education plans. While SIPs are \nbeing widely prepared by schools, the mechanism where SIPs feed into village education plans, \ndistrict  education  plans,  and  the  ASIP  has  scope  for  improvement.  As  a  result,  planning \ncontinues  to  be  largely  a  top\u2013down  process  with  incremental  budgeting  and  no  clear \nprioritization for districts or activities in need of more resources. \n24.  Financial management. Over 2004\u20132009, the planning and budgeting and measures of \nperformance have also improved. The measures of physical and financial performance are both \napproaching 100%. The main problem occurs in the distribution of funds from central to school \nlevel. Delays in fund release affect scholarship distribution, appointment of teachers, textbook \navailability, and construction activities at schools. Delays in the release of funds occur at the \ncentral level (because of delays in approval of the AWPB and delayed issuance of spending \nauthorization) and the district level (resulting from limited capacity to deal with peaks of work). In \n2008, just over half of the students received their books (either a full or partial set) within the first \n2 weeks of the school year. At the time of the EFA midterm review, DOE presented a short-term \naction plan to improve financial management in order to address the following concerns raised \nby the joint financing arrangement (JFA) partners based on the financial monitoring report \n(FMR): (i) delays in funds release to district offices, (ii) delays in submission of FMRs, (iii) the \nquality of school audits, and (iv) compliance with social audits. Subsequently, a committee was \nset  up  to monitor  implementation  of  the  action  plan.  A  recent  financial  assessment  noted \nsatisfactory progress on the action plan. \n25.  Program-based  approach  and  program  design.  At  the  process  level,  EFA  has \ndemonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of development partner harmonization. The JFA \nhas helped harmonize resources and develop a culture of partnership, and has contributed to \nreducing the transaction cost of program management for the Government and development \npartners. The JFA has also contributed to strengthening in-country capacity through greater \nreliance  on  country  systems.  Further,  the  development  partner  harmonization  process \ndeveloped by MOE in education has been a model for progress in the country. The Government \nhas started a dialogue with development partners to extend program-based approaches (PBAs) \nto other sectors. \n2.  School Sector Reform Program \n26.  To build on the achievements of EFA, and address some of the shortcomings and \nconstraints, the Government has developed the school sector reform (SSR) program. The SSR \nprogram envisions a transition from the current subsector approach, with education financed by \nprograms  such  as  EFA  and  the  Secondary  Education  Support  Program  (SESP),10 to  an \nintegrated  program  approach.  SSR  aims  to  restructure  the  primary  and  secondary  school \nsystem into an integrated grade 1\u201312 system in a phased manner. The Government recognizes \nthat 5 years of basic education is not sufficient and intends to extend basic education coverage \nto grades 1\u20138 and integrate secondary education into grades 9\u201312. It also intends to improve \nsynergies  between  basic  education  and  secondary  education  to  achieve  a  more  holistic \napproach to school education. The SSR program is partly a continuation of earlier programs \n                                                 \n10 MOE. 2002. Secondary Education Support Programme Core Document. Kathmandu. \n ", "  7 \nsuch as EFA and the SESP, and partly the beginning of new reforms characterized by strategic \ninterventions  such  as  restructuring  school  education,  and  improvement  of  the  quality  and \nefficiency  of  education.  Through  implementation  of  these  reform  agendas  and  specific \ninterventions, the Government aims to address the 8% of children (age 5\u20139) and about 25% of \nchildren (age 5\u201312) currently out-of-school, and high dropout and repetition rates at the primary \nand lower secondary level. Achieving sustainable improvements in learning achievement levels \nand improving the cost-efficiency and effectiveness of its services also constitute a major focus \nin SSR. The expected outcome of the SSR program is a more equitable, inclusive, effective, \nand holistic education system. The SSR program implementation period spans 7 years, from \nFY2010 to FY2016. \na.  SSR Key Features \n27.  In accordance with the Interim Constitution, SSR guarantees free basic education to all \nchildren and encourages local governments to make basic education compulsory. A range of \naffirmative actions to support education for girls and disadvantaged groups has been defined. \nSSR intends to provide multiple educational choices to schools and communities with regard to \nlearning content, medium of instruction, learning materials, and delivery methods. Strategies to \nimprove  the  relevance  of  education  to  local  needs  include  multigrade  teaching  and  the \ndevelopment and teaching of local content curriculum.  \n28.  Strategies to improve the quality and relevance of education have been strengthened. A \nprerequisite is the setting of norms and standards for quality improvement and assurance at all \nlevels. Quality control is to be assured by an independent monitoring body accountable to the \ninterministerial Education Policy Committee (EPC). Quality is also to be measured by learning \noutcomes.  The  curriculum  will  be  revised  to  make  it  more  competency-based.  Teachers\u2019 \nminimum qualifications will be redefined according to the restructuring of grades 1\u20138 and grades \n9\u201312. Guidelines for teacher development have been developed.  \n29.  SSR ultimately envisions a contractual model between central and local government \nbodies and the schools, wherein government bodies will be responsible for providing minimum \nenabling conditions for learning; in exchange, schools will be responsible for achieving an \nagreed standard for service delivery, learning achievements, and outcomes.  \n30.  The SSR program is backed by several key legal and policy documents in Nepal: The \nInterim Constitution of 2007; the Education Act of 1971, and Education Regulation of 2002; the \nEducation for All National Plan of Action 2001\u20132015 of 2001; the Three-Year Interim Plan 2007\u2013\n2010 of 2007; the School Sector Reform core document of 2008; and the Higher Secondary \nEducation Act of 1989. The Interim Constitution entitles each citizen to receive free education \nfrom the state up to secondary level, and each community has the right to provide basic \neducation in its mother tongue to preserve and promote its script and cultural heritage. The \nEducation Act and Education Regulation serve as a basic legal framework for the overall \nmanagement and administration of school education for grades 1\u201310. The Higher Secondary \nEducation Act was amended in 2006 to integrate higher secondary education with the school \nsystem. The Education for All National Plan of Action is a core policy document in the education \nsector, with the main focus on primary education. The Three-Year Interim Plan was prepared by \nthe National Planning Commission and approved by the Government. Under the reformed \nsystem of 8-year basic education (grades 1\u20138) followed by 4-year secondary education (grades \n9\u201312), it states that general, technical, and vocational courses will be further developed and \nintroduced at the secondary level. It also spells out the need for a revised policy to expand \naccess to secondary education, especially among people below the poverty line. The SSR core \ndocument restructures the fragmented school system into two tiers\u2014basic and secondary.  \n ", "8 \n \nb.  SSR Development Process \n31.  SSR  initiation. The Government has long envisioned extending basic education to \ncover grades 1\u20138 and integrating secondary education to cover grades 9\u201312 to restructure \nschool education into an integrated grade 1\u201312 school system, with the objective of improving \nsynergies between the basic and secondary subsectors. As early as 2004, the Government \nrequested technical assistance from ADB11 to develop a holistic, programmatic approach for \ngrades 1\u201312.  \n32.  Education  Policy  Committee.  At  MOE\u2019s  initiative,  an  interministerial  EPC  was \nestablished by the cabinet in June 2006. The EPC is a permanent education policy formulation \nand  coordination  structure  at  leadership  level.  It  was  established  to  provide  broad \ninterministerial policy guidance for the education sector, in recognition of the key role of other \nstakeholders in the provision of education, in addition to MOE. To coordinate efforts in the \neducation  sector,  the  EPC  was  established  to  harmonize  approaches  among  the  different \nministries  involved.  One  of  the  EPC\u2019s  first  tasks  was  to  develop  a  concept  paper  that \nrecommends a policy direction for the grade 1\u201312 school system, then to provide guidance on \nthe preparation of the new grade 1\u201312 core document. The EPC has advised the Government \non adjustments to education governance and on the management and financing structures \nneeded to support an equitable and effective grade 1\u201312 school system. \n33.  SSR core document. The Government subsequently embarked on the preparation of \nthe SSR core document to guide the preparation and transition from the subsector approach, \nwith education financed by programs such as the EFA and the SESP, to an integrated SSR \nprogram. The core document guides the implementation of SSR. It serves as a policy guide for \ngradual introduction of the grade 1\u201312 integrated system. It also clarifies the Government\u2019s \nlong-term vision and commitments with respect to the provision, promotion, and appraisal of \neducational services within the framework of the grade 1\u201312 system. The SSR core document \nwas approved by the Council of Ministers in June 2008. \n34.  SSR  plan.  After  approval  of  the  SSR  core  document,  the  Government  initiated \npreparation  of  the  SSR  plan,  a  long-term  strategic  plan  that  translates  the  broad  policy \ndirections of the SSR core document into implementable strategic interventions. The SSR plan \ndescribes the goals and objectives that will be pursued by the Government from FY2010 to \nFY2016.  The  plan  comprises  the  key  strategic  interventions  and  the  estimated  financial \nresources required to implement these strategies. It plans to focus on the extension of basic \neducation  to  grades  1\u20138  during  its  initial  phase  (FY2010\u2013FY2012)  and  gradually  extend \nsecondary education to grades 9\u201312 (FY2013\u2013FY2016). The SSR plan was presented to the \ndevelopment partners during the pre-appraisal mission in December 2008.  \n35.  SSR 5-year implementation plan. The SSR core document and the SSR plan have \nbeen developed for a 7-year time frame (FY2010\u2013FY2016) in view of working toward achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for education by 2015. However, a 7-year time \nhorizon presents multiple challenges in terms of planning and detailing implementation plans. In \nterms of financing, 7 years extends beyond the planning horizon of both the Government and \ndevelopment partners. Moreover, the current uncertain macroeconomic environment dictates a \ncautious approach with respect to funding availability. The Government correspondingly phased \nthe implementation of SSR and reduced the overall budget requirement from $5.1 billion to $4.1 \nbillion  over  the  7-year  period.  It  further  developed  a  5-year  implementation  plan  within  a \ncorresponding budget envelope of $2.6 billion and has adjusted output targets accordingly. This \n5-year plan was submitted to the development partners in June 2009 and has formed the basis \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2004.

Development  partners\u2019  contributions  are \nexpected to be allocated to this plan. The broader vision expressed in the core document \nremains valid and serves as a guide for expansion of the program in case additional sources are \nidentified. \n36.  SSR model building. The Government recognized that preparation of a comprehensive \nreform program such as SSR is a complex and lengthy process that requires several important \nsteps. Given the many strategic options and alternatives being considered for introduction under \nSSR,  the  Government  felt  that  testing  alternatives  and  further  developing  capacity  for \nimplementing the SSR program was necessary. It prepared an initial SSR transitional plan, \nwhich includes a model building of the extension of basic education from grades 1\u20135 to grades \n1\u20138  in  selected  districts.  Furthermore,  stakeholders\u2019  capacity  development  requirements  at \nvarious  levels  were  identified,  and  capacity  development  initiated.  Lessons  learned  and \nexperiences gained from implementation of grade 1\u20138 basic education in selected districts and \nschools will feed into the preparation process for full implementation of the SSR program.  \n37.  Stakeholder consultation. Stakeholder involvement in the development of SSR was \nensured within the ministry, as well as at the central and local level. SSR development was led \nby a group of senior MOE officials under the guidance of the interministerial EPC\u2014involving the \nNational Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Women and Social \nAffairs, and the Ministry of Local Development. SSR was developed by MOE and experts from \nthe line agencies. The work was supported by a number of thematic local experts. A series of \nstakeholder consultations was held, involving political parties, teacher unions, Dalit associations, \ndistrict  offices,  and  school  management  committees.  Stakeholder  consultation  entailed  a \nlengthy process of consensus building among stakeholders with differing backgrounds and \ninterests. \nc.  SSR Strengths and Challenges \n38.  Over 2008 and 2009, development partners have jointly conducted a series of technical, \npre-appraisal, and appraisal meetings to engage in policy dialogue with the Government on the \nSSR program and to appraise the program. This process was fruitful in developing a common \nunderstanding  of  the  program,  and  strengthening  the  program  design  through  discussions \namong technical experts and sharing of international best practices.  \n39.  Government  and  stakeholder  ownership.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \nimplement SSR is high. It has shown strong ownership in the development of SSR and has \nconsistently taken the lead in the process, largely drawing on internal resources and expertise. \nExternal expertise was selectively used in an advisory way on a demand basis. Broad in-country \nstakeholder consultation also provided useful feedback during SSR development. \n40.  Articulate  vision.  The  SSR  key  documents  present  a  clear  indication  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s key reform plans. Besides the structural integration of basic 1\u20138 and secondary \n9\u201312, SSR correctly identifies and intends to address key systemic issues that affect the overall \neffectiveness of the system. SSR puts strong emphasis on improvement of quality and internal \nefficiency.  \n41.  Comprehensive sector plan. SSR expands the PBA to secondary education. It allows \nfor an integrated and holistic approach to sector issues; and stimulates comprehensive sector \ndialogue  among  the  Government,  development  partners,  and  other  stakeholders  around  a \nsingle vision and plan. \n42.  Prioritization and sequencing of reforms. The SSR core document, as a reflection of \nthe Government\u2019s vision of the education sector by 2015, entails a vast number of changes and \nreforms. Subsequent versions of the SSR plan brought about the realization that the reform \n ", "10 \n \nagenda needed to be phased to meet the financial and resource capacity of the system. This \nexercise resulted in the 5-year phased SSR implementation plan (para. 35). From FY2010 \nonward, SSR will be implemented throughout the country, focusing on the integration and \nconsolidation of basic education (grades 1\u20138), completing the process by 2012. At the same \ntime, model building for secondary education (grades 9\u201312) and vocational education will start \nfrom  FY2010  and  continue  through  FY2013  and  beyond.  The  restructuring  of  secondary \neducation, including integration of grades 9\u201312 and the introduction of a vocational stream, will \nbe initiated across the country from FY2013  in a phased manner,  and is expected to be \ncompleted by 2016. This implementation plan is consistent with and works toward the goals of \nthe broader vision as described in the SSR core document. The Government and development \npartners agreed that the SSR core document serves as a useful framework to identify additional \nstrategies and actions, in case additional resources become available for SSR implementation. \nFigure 1 summarizes the time frame and phasing of the SSR program. \nFigure 1: Time Frame and Phasing of the SSR Program\nCY2009 CY2010 CY2011 CY2012 CY2013 CY2014 CY2015 CY2016\nFY2010 FY2011 FY2012 FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 FY2016\nSSR Implementation Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nSSR Phase I: Basic Education  SSR Phase II: Secondary Education \nSSR Phasing\nRestructuring (1\u20138) Restructuring (9\u201312)\nSSR Plan SSR Plan\nCY = calendar year, FY = fiscal year, SSR = school sector reform.\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n \n43.  Sector financing plan. Multiple stakeholders contribute to financing education. While \nthe main financiers include MOE and development partners, a substantial part of the cost is \nborne  by  local  communities,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  other  ministries  (in \nparticular the Ministry of Local Development), and parents. About 12% of basic education \nstudents and 30% of secondary students in Nepal attend private schools, also referred to as \ninstitutional schools, to which the Government does not provide support. At this stage, the SSR \nfinancing plan encompasses the costs and available funds of MOE and development partners. \nA comprehensive sector financing strategy incorporating all stakeholders and contributors would \nfacilitate  the  development  of  strategic  partnerships  and  cost-sharing  strategies.  The \nGovernment intends to develop this strategy in the first phase of the SSR implementation period. \n44.  Institutional arrangements and governance reform. One of the main policy thrusts of \nthe EFA program has been decentralization. This involved decentralizing to SMCs management \nauthorities such as hiring of community teachers, fixing their terms of employment, mobilizing \nresources,  and  approving  and  executing  school  budgets.  This  has  created  an  enabling \nenvironment for MOE, DOE, and DEO to focus more on policy making, financing, standard \nsetting, monitoring, and provision of technical support. During the EFA period, steps were also \ntaken to enhance support of local bodies to the school education sector by strengthening of \ndistrict  education  committees  and  village  education  committees,  and  assigning  significant \nresponsibilities to district education committees, including the authority to establish and manage \npre-primary and adult education, set priority for establishing schools in the district development \ncommittee, and make recommendations for the approval and dissolution of schools in the \ndistricts. \n45.  SSR,  while  continuing  community  management  of  schools,  envisions  devolving  a \nnumber  of  governance  and  management  functions  of  MOE,  DOE  and  DEO  to  local \n ", "  11 \ngovernments  and  communities.  Governance  functions  relate  to  planning  and  allocation  of \nresources, location of schools, providing choice over formal and alternative schooling, setting up \nquality standards, and ensuring access to quality basic education for all children of school going \nage.  Management  functions  translate  policy  decisions  into  program  and  implementation \nstrategies. The goal is to develop a devolved education governance and management system.  \n46.  However, at present there are no elected representatives in the local bodies, and they \nare unlikely to be in place for a few years. Local bodies are currently being administered by civil \nservants. Moreover, it is expected that the transition process from a unitary state to a federal \nstate will involve the restructuring of local bodies, possibly changing the number of tiers, and \ntheir  geographical  jurisdiction  and  mandate.  As  a  result,  the  education  governance  and \naccountability mechanism envisaged in SSR can be redefined only at the later stage of program \nimplementation. Until then, the system will continue to operate under the prevailing governance \narrangements. \n47.  Free secondary education. The Interim Constitution stipulates that education should be \nprovided free of charge up to secondary level. In accordance with this provision, SSR intends to \nmake  secondary  education  gradually  free.  However,  it  is  unclear  under  current  budget \nconstraints how this goal can be achieved. Government intervention, in particular in higher \nsecondary education, is limited, and free provision up to grade 12 would have significant cost \nimplications.  A  transition  plan  for  secondary  education  restructuring  and  financing  will  be \ndeveloped  in  the  early  phase  of  SSR.  Careful  consideration  will  need  to  be  given  to  the \ndevelopment of partnerships with other financiers in view of their funding predictability.  \nD.  ADB Assistance and Lessons Learned \n1.  Past and Ongoing ADB Assistance \n48.  ADB\u2019s earlier assistance to Nepal consisted of a number of projects. At the primary \nschool level, ADB supported EFA through the Teacher Education Project,12 which provides pre-\nservice and in-service primary teacher training. At the secondary school level, the SESP,13 \nalthough designed as a project, was the result of extensive sector analysis and policy dialogue, \nand  is built  on  a shared  long-term  vision  for  secondary  education reform  and  institutional \ndevelopment. The SESP core document is guided by the Tenth Plan. The complexity of the \ndisbursement  modalities  and  differences  in  accounting  procedures  used  by  ADB,  the \nGovernment of Denmark, and the Government of Nepal strengthened the rationale for ADB to \njoin the PBA arrangement through the ESP cluster. The Skills for Employment Project14 is \nassisting the delivery of short-term training, particularly to women, Dalits, and the disadvantaged; \nstrengthening the capacity to facilitate and deliver short-term training; and helping articulate a \nnew TEVT policy. Assistance provided by other development partners to the education sector \ncan be found in the development coordination matrix (Appendix 4). \n2.  The Education Sector Program Cluster \n49.  ADB launched the ESP cluster in 2006 to support the preparation and implementation of \nSSR.  The  ESP  adopted  a  program  cluster  approach  to  phase  ADB  assistance.  Three \nsubprograms were envisioned in accordance with the time frame and progress of the SSR \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2001.

The ESP subprogram I,15 approved on 1 December 2006, supports \nthe Nepal EFA program (2004\u20132009) for basic and primary education (grades 1\u20135) with a \nprogram  loan  for  $30  million  from  FY2007  to  FY2009.  A  capacity  development  grant  of \n$2 million complements the ESP subprogram I to develop government stakeholders\u2019 capacity in \npolicy analysis, formulation, and coordination. It also supported the preparation of the SSR core \ndocument. The ESP subprogram II,16 approved on 24 January 2008, supports the preparation \nand transition to SSR from FY2008 to FY2011, in particular a model-building exercise of the \nbasic  education  extension  to  grades  1\u20138  in  a  few  districts,  as  well  as  broad  capacity \ndevelopment for system readiness.  \n50.  Progress of subprogram I (program loan). The ESP subprogram I provides budget \nsupport  to  the  EFA  program,  which  is  pooled  with  funds  from  other  pooling  development \npartners, as well as from the Government. As such, the progress of subprogram I coincides with \nthe  progress  of  the  primary  education  subsector  and  of  the  EFA  program.  Outcome  and \nimplementation strategy progress are described in paras. 9-25. Subprogram I was released into \ntwo equal tranches of $15 million. The first tranche was released upon loan effectiveness. First \ntranche release conditions pertained to the endorsement of the EFA core document, preparation \nof the FY2007 ASIP and AWPB, and achievement of FY2006 performance targets. The second \ntranche of EFA subprogram I had three conditions, relating to (i) the performance of program \nimplementation in FY2007 in relation to the ASIP FY2007; (ii) the preparation of ASIP FY2009 \nby MOE and its endorsement by the JFA partners, including ADB; and (iii) the preparation by \nMOE of an action plan with resource allocation on the implementation of the recommendations \nof the EFA midterm review. As these conditions were met, the second tranche was released on \n3 January 2009.  \n51.  Progress of subprogram I (capacity development grant). The capacity development \ngrant associated with ESP subprogram I has been supporting the core document thematic \ngroup works, consultation workshops, teacher workshops, school and teacher mapping, and \ncapacity development of MOE policy functions. The grant enabled support and preparatory \nworks for SSR at the central, regional, and district levels. Consultation workshops, capacity \ndevelopment programs and exposure visits, development of a policy compendium, and regular \ntechnical support were made available to the MOE core document team. The support resulted in \nthe successful preparation of the SSR core document, which was approved by the Council of \nMinisters in June 2008. The grant also facilitated decentralization of the examination system at \nthe regional and district level. Support to the examination system is currently ongoing, with \nserver, computers, line printer, and examination software already in place in all five regions. The \nteacher and school mapping exercise is currently ongoing. MOE has recently approved a list of \n30 districts to be covered under the grant and a team within MOE has been constituted to \noversee  school  and  teacher  mapping  activities.  The  mapping  exercise  will  provide  the \nnecessary inputs to the school restructuring exercise to be undertaken under SSR.  \n52.  Progress of subprogram II. The model building and capacity development exercise, \npreparing for implementation of the SSR program, is being supported by ADB through the ESP \nsubprogram II, approved on 24 January 2008. Activities in the three model-building districts \n(Rasuwa, Kapilvastu, and Dadeldhura) include stakeholder consultations on SSR strategies and \nimplementation  modalities,  workshops,  and  pilot  interventions.  A  series  of  workshops  was \norganized among central, district, local, and school level stakeholders in each of the districts. \nThe participants of the workshops prepared an action plan of activities being implemented to \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2006.

Subprogram II was released in a single tranche of $8 million upon grant effectiveness. \nThe tranche release conditions pertained to the endorsement of the draft SSR core document; \nthe approval of an SSR transitional plan, including model building activities and a broad capacity \ndevelopment plan; and the development of a satisfactory financial control mechanism. The \ntranche release conditions were met by the time of consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n54.  Proposed subprogram III. As the EFA program (grades 1\u20135) and the SESP program \n(grades 6\u201310) end by FY2009, the SSR program covering grades 1\u201312 starts from FY2010 \nonward. The ESP subprogram III is therefore proposed to start in FY2010 to initiate support to \nthe  SSR  program.  In  particular,  subprogram  III,  which  will  run  from  FY2010\u2013FY2012,  is \nproposed to support the first phase of SSR, which will focus on the implementation of basic \neducation restructuring, while model building activities will be initiated for secondary education \nand TEVT. The proposed ESP subprogram III integrates the ongoing assistance provided by \nADB  to  the  EFA  program  and  SESP  program,  and  extends  the  policy-oriented  program \napproach adopted under ESP subprograms I and II to the secondary education subsector. It will \nassist the Government in moving toward a holistic approach to school education. The evolution \nin ADB\u2019s assistance from a project approach to a policy-oriented program approach is in line \nwith the ADB\u2019s education sector policy,18 which emphasizes the changing role of ADB from a \nproject financier to a development partner assisting in formulation of sector policies and capacity \ndevelopment. The proposed ESP subprogram III is also consistent with ADB\u2019s recent strategic \nstudy in education,19 which stresses the need to focus increasingly on subsectors beyond basic \neducation. The proposed subprogram is in line with the current Nepal country strategy and \nprogram, 2005\u20132009,20 which emphasizes the role of ADB in supporting inclusive development \nas spelled out in the country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper embodied in the Tenth Plan. It is \nalso consistent with the draft Nepal country partnership strategy 2010\u20132014, which proposes a \ncontinuation of supporting inclusive social development by enhancing access to education.  \n55.  To continue support for the SSR program, which will continue until FY2016, further ADB \nassistance may be considered to initiate support for the restructuring of secondary education. \nFigure 2 describes the sequencing of ADB assistance and the subprograms in relation to the \nGovernment\u2019s education programs. \n                                                 \n17 A field visit to one of the model building districts was undertaken during the Appraisal Mission. \n18 ADB. 2002.

Lessons Learned \n56.  A recent country assistance program evaluation21 of ADB\u2019s support to the education \nsector in Nepal found that ADB assistance to the EFA program in primary education using the \nPBA has so far been successful. ADB\u2019s adoption of the PBA significantly improved portfolio \nmanagement  and  fund  disbursements  in  the  education  sector  while  the  program  cluster \napproach provided continuity and timeliness of ADB support. The Government benefited from \nthe EFA pooled funding arrangement, which substantially reduced the Government\u2019s workload \nin managing multiple development partner project systems and different reporting requirements, \nand resulted in strengthening the core functions of MOE. Cost-efficiency was likewise achieved \nthrough the use of the government system and through greater community participation in \neducation service delivery. \n57.  Areas for improvement identified by the country assistance program evaluation include \nthe need to improve the internal efficiency of the education system by addressing the high \nprimary education repetition rate and high dropout rate, as well as improving quality. An area \nthat will also require attention is the need to strengthen the planning and predictability of capital \nbudgeting  to  address  the  growing  demand  for  classrooms  caused  by  the  rapid  growth  in \nenrollment  during  the  last  few  years.  The  unevenness  in  the  capacity  of  local  education \nauthorities and schools also remains a concern. Further, there is a need for greater functional \nclarity  and  an  accountability  mechanism  between  districts  and  schools  to  ensure  effective \neducation service provision in the new decentralized context. Establishment of the EPC and \nMOE\u2019s commitment to implement its decentralization policy contributed to the effectiveness of \nthe  education  sector.  The  country  assistance  program  evaluation  recommended  that  ADB \ncontinue using the PBA and continue to assist the Government in developing and expanding \nhigher quality, more accessible primary and secondary education. \n58.  Lessons learned from the implementation of EFA include (i) the importance of feasible \nimplementation  plans  for  the  implementation  of  legislative  and  policy  directives;  (ii)  the \nperceived significant impact of incentive schemes; (iii) the importance of the teaching\u2013learning \nprocess, and the fact that teacher training alone is not sufficient to enhance the process; (iv) the \nimportance of credibly monitoring quality; (v) the importance of ECED, nonformal education, and \nliteracy programs for improving access to schooling; (vi) the importance of bottom-up planning \nto improve conditions at the school level; (vii) the effectiveness of developing specific action \nplans  to  address  fiduciary  matters;  and  (viii)  the  importance  of continuous  monitoring  and \n                                                 \n21 ADB.  2009.

These lessons have been addressed in the following ways \nin the SSR program design through (i) the development of implementation plans and action \nplans for timely implementation of policy directions, and their inclusion in the policy matrix; \n(ii) the continuation and improvement of scholarship schemes; (iii) the inclusion of teacher \nperformance management, deployment, and qualification upgrading aspects; (iv) the adoption of \nlearning assessments for grades 3, 5, and 8 of international standard; (v) the continuation and \nexpansion of ECED, nonformal education, and literacy programs under SSR; (vi) strengthening \nof the SIP process and focusing capacity development at the local level; (vii) the development \nand  inclusion  in  the  JFA  of  the  Governance  and  Accountability  Action  Plan  (GAAP);  and \n(viii) periodic monitoring and evaluation as key SSR activities. Further lessons from SESP \nimplementation include the importance of government ownership and leadership for timely and \nsmooth  implementation,  and  the  effectiveness  of  scholarship  programs.  These  have  been \naddressed in SSR through support for government leadership in the development of SSR, with \nonly limited external inputs; and the continuation of scholarship programs at secondary level.  \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n59.  The  expected  overall  impact  of  the  ESP  cluster  program,  including  the  ESP \nsubprogram  III, is enhanced educational attainment and livelihood for all children, particularly \ngirls and disadvantaged groups. The expected outcome of the ESP subprogram III is increased \naccess to and quality of school education, particularly basic education (grades 1\u20138), especially \nfor children from marginalized groups.  \nB.  Policy Actions and Outputs for Subprogram III \n60.  The SSR program is composed of several components encompassing the following \nsubsectors and crosscutting areas: (i) basic education; (ii) secondary education; (iii) ECED; \n(iv) literacy  and  lifelong  learning;  (v)  TEVT;  (vi)  teacher  professional  development;  and \n(vii) capacity  development,  management,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Across  program \ncomponents, social inclusion and quality improvement are key objectives.  \n61.  The program design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) was developed by the \nGovernment in close collaboration with the development partners. It describes the impact, \noutcome, and outputs of the 5-year SSR implementation plan developed by the Government \n(para. 35). As such, the design and monitoring framework spans a period that extends beyond \nthe duration of the ESP subprogram III. In view of the pool funding, in which ADB\u2019s resources \nare aggregated with government funding and funding from other development partners, no \ndistinction can be made between the SSR design and monitoring framework and the framework \nfor the ESP subprogram III. However, each of the sections below will focus on the policy and \nstrategic implementation actions the Government intends to take over the ESP subprogram III \nperiod (FY2010\u2013FY2012) toward achieving the intended longer-term outputs and outcome. In \naddition, the sections will highlight the expected mid-period (FY2012) target values for the \nmonitoring indicators, which coincides with the end of the ESP subprogram III period. The ESP \nsubprogram III development policy letter and program policy matrix are in Appendix 5. \n1.  Basic Education  \n62.  Basic education will continue to be the main focus of the education sector in Nepal and \nthe SSR program. Reforms will be initiated in basic education, and gradually spread to other \nareas of SSR, in particular secondary education and TEVT. Basic education comprises about \n75% of the 5-year SSR budget. \n ", "16 \n \n63.  Recognizing that 5 years of basic education is insufficient, one key policy change is the \nextension of basic education up to grade 8. Changes in the legislative provisions will be made to \nextend basic education formally up to grade 8. In conjunction with this, basic education schools \nwill be encouraged to restructure into three substructures to rationalize the school structure: \nfoundation  schools  with  grades  1\u20133,  primary  schools  with  grades  1\u20135,  and  upper  primary \nschools with grades 1\u20138. Norms and procedures for school restructuring have been developed. \nLocal governments will develop their own norms and criteria to restructure existing schools in \nline with the national norms.  \n64.  To reach the 8% of the current school age population in primary education (age 5\u20139) \nand about 25% in basic education (age 5\u201312) that are still out of school, SSR will extend free22 \nbasic education to all children of corresponding age up to grade 8. The Government will develop \na phased plan to make free basic education compulsory. With the extension of benefits from the \ncurrent  grade  1\u20135  system  to  grade  1\u20138  coverage,  and  the  introduction  of  an  integrated \ncurriculum up to grade 8, more students are expected to complete a cycle of 8 years of \neducation, whereas they might leave school after grade 5 in the current system. This will result \nin a higher average number of schooling years for children in Nepal, leading to higher average \nqualifications and better future earning potential. \n65.  In line with the key objective of social inclusion, SSR emphasizes the need to improve \naccess  to  education  for  girls  and  disadvantaged  groups  such  as  Dalit,  Madhesis,23 and \nmountain  communities.  Despite  substantial  achievements  made  under  EFA,  children  from \nvulnerable groups are overrepresented in the out-of-school population and remain a hard-to-\nreach group for reasons related to social distance as well as physical distance to the schools. \nPolicies and strategies for enhanced social inclusion and a range of actions, including inclusive \neducation and affirmative action, have been adopted in the program. These include financial \nand pedagogical support and incentive schemes targeted to schools as well as financial and in-\nkind support to families and children. Free alternative programs will be provided for students \nwho cannot attend formal schools. Special provisions will be made to cater to the needs of \npublic school students in Karnali Zone, one of the poorest areas in the country. SSR also \nprovides for the recognition and support of caste and cultural education sources like Gumbas, \nVihar, Madarsas, and Gurukul, which will contribute to the education of children not attending \nmainstream  education.  Norms  and  guidelines  that  define  the  various  types  of  formal  and \nnonformal basic education services have been developed.  \n66.  To enhance the quality of education, SSR has defined minimum enabling conditions \n(MECs) that all basic education schools should attain. MECs encompass an adequate physical \nand educational environment, curriculum and textbooks, and the instructional provision. The \nrationale is that until schools have the minimum physical environment, educational environment, \ninstructional provisions, and curriculum and textbooks, it is not realistic to expect measurable \nimprovements in learning outcomes and quality. The primary mechanism for meeting MECs \nover time is the SIP. Schools will be responsible for developing the SIP with the objective of \nreaching the MECs. Earmarked grants and direct provision of inputs by the central Government \nwill contribute the necessary resources for schools to achieve the MECs. This mechanism is \nexpected  to  strengthen  the  link  between  local  and  central  level  planning.  Implementation \nguidelines for MECs will be developed prior to program effectiveness. Support and sanctioning \nmechanisms will be developed, depending on the reason for schools not meeting MECs. If \nexternal circumstances cause the failure to reach MECs, school may receive extra funds. If it is \n                                                 \n22  Free basic education provisions include cost-free services for admission, textbooks, tuition, and examinations. In \naddition, the Government will continue to rely on community contributions for various aspects of schooling, such as \nschool construction. \n23  Traditional inhabitants of the lowlands (Terai). \n ", "  17 \nthe school\u2019s failure to provide adequate services, the school personnel may be given adequate \nguidance or be sanctioned. The system of MECs recognizes the shared responsibility among \ngovernment, communities, and schools toward a common goal of providing quality education \nand achieving desired outcomes.  \n67.  SSR further intends to (i) develop competency-based curricula for grades 1\u201312, local \ncontent curricula, mother tongue materials and instruction for early grades, learner-focused \nteacher development programs, textbook provision for all subjects and grades, and multigrade \nteaching for basic levels where appropriate; and (ii) link teacher career development to teacher \nperformance through an accountability structure that includes community monitoring.  \n68.  Teachers  will  be  trained  in  new  student-centered  learning  methods  and  continuous \nassessment will be introduced. Minimum teacher qualifications for basic education will be raised \nfrom secondary education to higher secondary education, and separate head-teacher positions \nwill be created. Sample-based, national assessments at grades 3, 5, and 8 as well as end-of-\nlevel standardized high stakes examinations at grade 8 will be introduced to monitor quality \nimprovements. To implement the examinations, the establishment of a National Examination \nBoard (NEB) will be prepared.  \n69.  National  standards  for  education  service  delivery  will  be  developed.  An  Education \nReview Office will be established at central level for conducting external audits of agencies at \ndifferent levels based on these norms and standards. Once approved, the national standards \nbecome  the  basis  for  curriculum  development,  teacher  training,  teacher  management, \nexaminations, school operations management, and school finance. \n70.  The reforms in basic education are expected to enhance equitable access to quality \nbasic education. Improved quality education is expected to contribute to lower dropout and \nrepetition rates, which will enhance the efficiency of the education system. By 2012, the reforms \nin basic education are expected to achieve the following key results: \n(i)  The net intake rate (excluding repeaters) in grade 1 will improve from 81% in \n2008 to 88% in 2012. \n(ii)  The net enrollment rate for basic education (grades 1\u20138) will improve from 73% \nin 2008 to 80% in 2012. \n(iii)  The survival rate up to grade 8 will improve from 41% in 2008 to 54% in 2012. \n(iv)  The Gender Parity Index will improve from 0.97 in 2008 to 0.98 in 2012. \n(v)  The repetition rate in grade 1 will be reduced from 28% in 2008 to 5% in 2014. \n2.  Secondary Education \n71.  Building on the lessons identified from the SESP, the Government has expanded the \nprogrammatic and holistic subsector approach adopted under EFA to secondary education. \nSSR aims to improve the access, equity, quality, and relevance of secondary education. The \ntargets include an increased NER from 21% in 2008 to 24% in 2012 alongside improvements in \ngender equity and access for marginalized groups. The grade 12 HSLC pass rate is targeted to \nimprove from 25% in 2008 to 34% in 2012 as a fraction of student entrants. Key interventions to \nenhance access and equity include the continuation of SESP scholarship schemes to ensure \naccess to and completion of secondary education for girls, Dalits, marginalized groups, the \ndisabled, and children from poor households. Access will also be enhanced through expansion \nof physical facilities, including classroom construction and rehabilitation, library and laboratory \nconstruction,  and  the  construction of  schools for  children  with  special  needs.  To  enhance \naccess to secondary education further, the policy intent under SSR is to make secondary \n ", "18 \n \neducation gradually free24 by 2015. In view of budget constraints, the Government will explore \npartnerships with private providers and will initiate the development of a comprehensive sector \nfinancing plan.  \n72.  Norms and guidelines to enhance quality for secondary education provision are yet to be \ndeveloped. During the early years of SSR implementation, the program will focus on standard \nsetting for secondary education provision, including teacher standards, curriculum standards, \nand  standards  for  educational  environment.  The  SESP  identified  a  relevant  curriculum, \neducation materials and equipment, and linking teachers\u2019 skills to curriculum needs, as crucial \nfactors for quality secondary education\u2014underscoring the importance of setting norms and \nstandards.  \n73.  Recognizing the current fragmented structure of secondary education, pilot testing for \nthe structural integration of secondary (grades 9\u201310) and higher secondary (grades 11\u201312) \neducation will be conducted between the start of the program and 2012, prior to the full-fledged \nintegration of secondary education. A quality improvement system based on MECs will be \ndeveloped for implementation from 2013 onward.  \n74.  Subsequent to the examination reform in grade 8, examination reform is envisioned from \n2013  onward  for  secondary  education.  Examinations  will  be  held  at  three  levels:  district, \nregional, and national. District level examinations will be conducted at the end of grade eight, \nand will be administered by the DEO under NEB guidelines. Regional level examinations will be \nconducted  at  the  end  of  grade  10  and  will  be  administered  by  the  Regional  Education \nDirectorate under the NEB. National level examination for HSLC will be conducted at the end of \ngrade 12 and will be administered by the NEB. Two kinds of certificates will be provided at \nsecondary level: (i) SLC after grade 10, and (ii) HSLC after grade 12.  \n3.  Early Childhood Education and Development  \n75.  SSR is expanding the ECED system on the basis that grade 1 children with ECED \nexperience  have  lower  dropout  rates,  higher  completion  rates,  and  are  better  prepared \ncognitively and socially for school. The expected output for ECED is an expanded network of \nECED services both in coverage and quality, providing access to at least 1 year of basic ECED \nservices. The target under the SSR is to increase the percentage of new entrants at grade 1 \nwith ECED experience from 36% in 2008 to 51% in 2012.   \n76.  The main challenges the ECED system currently faces include (i) expanding ECED to \nrural areas, as the expansion has so far largely been limited to well-off areas and urban centers; \n(ii) recruiting and retaining qualified, competent facilitators given that inadequate budgets are \nleading  to  high  staff  turnover;  (iii)  focusing  ECED  on  holistic  child  development,  including \nlinkages with health and nutrition, since creative aspects of child development tend to be \ncrowded  out  by  academic  and  school-preparatory  curricula;  and  (iv)  coordination  and \nmanagement of different ECED modalities, as some ECED centers are school-based, others \nare community-based centers, and those in the urban centers are largely privately run. \n77.  To facilitate this expansion and enhancement of ECED services, the Government will \nfollow  a  partnership  modality,  whereby  it  will  develop  norms,  standards,  and  operational \nguidelines and will provide technical backstopping services through resource persons in the \nDEOs. An ECED focal point will be appointed in each district to carry out ECED coordination, \nplanning,  and  development  functions.  The  main  responsibility  for  creating  demand, \nimplementing and ensuring quality standards, and managing ECED centers will lie with the local \n                                                 \n24 Free secondary education will include at least free services of admission and tuition fees. Textbooks and curricular \nmaterials will be made available at a subsidized rate. \n ", "  19 \ngovernment  where  civil  society  organizations  will  play  a  critical  role  in  engaging  the  local \ncommunity. \n78.  To enhance access in underserved areas, emphasis will be placed on expanding ECED \nservices in disadvantaged and underserved areas. Funds will be provided for the establishment, \noperation, and sustenance of ECED centers in the marginalized areas and poverty pockets. In \nview of budget constraints, partnership arrangements with NGOs, cooperatives, national and \nlocal level institutes, and civil society organizations will be established for the financing of ECED.  \n79.  To  focus  on  the  holistic  development  of  children,  and  streamline  the  operational \nmodalities,  the  community-based  ECED  approach  will  be  promoted.  A  child-friendly \nenvironment in ECED centers will be developed. Children\u2019s mother tongues will be employed as \nthe  medium  of  instruction.  ECED  facilitators  will  be  recruited  locally,  ensuring  that  they \nrepresent the cultures and languages of children\u2019s family and community. The ECED curriculum \nwill draw on local content and knowledge systems. \n4.  Literacy and Lifelong Learning \n80.  Literacy  activities  under  SSR  are  complementary  to  the  recently  launched  National \nLiteracy Campaign aimed at attaining the EFA goals and MDGs. The need is evident since only \n72% of Nepal\u2019s population of 19 million people above 6 years of age is literate. The average \n15+ literacy level is 63%. The Gender Parity Index for the 15+ age group is only 0.84. SSR \nseeks to increase these figures to 83% (6+ literacy), 67% (15+ literacy), and 0.95 (Gender \nParity Index) by 2012.  \n81.  Literacy and post-literacy programs are expected to be a part of all Village Development \nPlans  by  the  end  of  the  program,  contributing  to  comprehensive  literacy  and  basic \ncompetencies that impart skills to improve the quality of life. They will target specific groups and \nareas including women, marginalized populations, Dalits, endangered communities, internally \ndisplaced  people,  people  with  disability,  and  people  living  with  HIV/AIDS.  As  with  ECED, \nemphasis will be placed on decentralization and partnerships with the private sector and NGOs \nto achieve goals of adult literacy and continuing education. Lifelong learning or continuing \neducation interventions will be provided by linking to the formal education system and through \nlocally managed arrangements at community learning centers. \n5.  Technical Education and Vocational Training \n82.  As in many other countries, Nepal has many dropouts and school-leavers who are \nunequipped  with  the  necessary  skills  to  enter  the  labor  market.  SSR  proposes  to  equip \nschoolchildren  with  skills  for  future  employment.  Integrating  skill  development  into  general \neducation  is,  however,  not  without  risk.  International  and  regional  experience  shows  that \ndeveloping technical streams in general education generally results in supply-driven, inflexible \nsystems in which schools are unable to provide and maintain the relevant equipment and where \nteachers with practical skills prove hard to recruit and retain.  \n83.  In view of these experiences, the core of TEVT activities, which aim to secure immediate \nemployment for school-leavers, will remain with the specialized technical institutes outside of \nthe  SSR  program.  The  school-based  TEVT  program  proposed  under  SSR  will  focus  on \ndeveloping generic skills to prepare schoolchildren for future employability. TEVT activities \nunder SSR will focus on piloting several options in the initial years. These may include (i) crafts \nand skills in school classes for grade 7 and 8 students using skilled crafters and tradespeople \nfrom the community; (ii) nonformal apprenticeship in grades 9 and 10 using private sector \ntraining  managers;  and  (iii)  three  learning  tracks  (Science  and  Technology,  Business  and \nCommerce, and Liberal Arts) in grades 11 and 12 leading to the same university accepted \n ", "20 \n \ncredits on graduation. Soft employability skills required by enterprise for employment will be part \nof all three curricula.  \n84.  TEVT activities under SSR will complement ongoing interventions in TEVT, such as \nADB\u2019s Skills for Employment Project and CTEVT\u2019s various technical and vocational training \nprograms. While the Skills for Employment Project and CTEVT focus on the provision of market-\noriented short-term skills training, SSR aims at strengthening the role of school education in the \nprovision of soft skills for future employability. TEVT activities are expected to result in an \nincreased understanding of the role of general education in skills development and will result in \nconcrete models for implementation. A phased implementation plan is expected to be approved, \nincorporating the experiences of pilot initiatives in participating schools. \n6.  Teacher Professional Development \n85.  SSR lays particular emphasis on teacher development at basic and secondary levels of \neducation. Only 66% of primary teachers and 77% of secondary teachers possess the basic \nrequired levels of qualification and training, and 9% do not have the required certification. These \nfigures would have been considerably lower had it not been for the ADB-supported Teacher \nEducation Project, which closed in July 2009. The teacher development component under SSR \nexpands teacher development to basic and secondary education. Recognizing that training \nteachers is a necessary but not sufficient condition to improve learning outcomes, it provides an \nintegrated approach to teacher development, addressing the related issues of qualification and \ncareer development\u2014thereby addressing teacher motivational issues. The aim of the teacher \ndevelopment component is to enhance qualifications and professional competencies of teachers \nin basic and secondary education to facilitate student learning processes effectively. It further \naims  at  improving  teacher  competency  and  performance  to  enhance  students\u2019  learning \nprocesses.  The  existing  teacher  training  policy  will  be  revised  to  include  provisions  on \nqualification upgrading, career development, and in-service professional support. Revisions will \nnot only address inadequacies in terms of qualifications and competency, but also motivational \nand career aspects of the teaching profession. \n86.  To  enhance  the  quality  of  teachers,  teacher  licensing  practices  will  be  enhanced. \nTeachers will be recruited at the local level from among the licensees in accordance with the \nguidelines provided by the central level. MOE will conduct a needs assessment and costing, \nand will develop a time-bound action plan on upgrading the minimum qualifications for teachers. \nHigher  secondary  education  will be  required  for  teaching  basic  education,  and  a  master\u2019s \ndegree in education or other disciplines with a relevant teacher preparation course for teaching \nsecondary level. Serving teachers with a qualification of SLC or below will have the following \noptions: (i) teaching lower grades such as 1\u20133 grades until retirement, (ii) upgrading their \nqualification to the minimum level in 5 years, for which the National Center for Educational \nDevelopment will work with the academic institutions to offer courses to upgrade the teacher\u2019s \nminimum qualification, or (iii) opt for voluntary retirement, in which case DOE will develop a \nvoluntary retirement package. For option (ii), it is expected that the cost of the training will be \nborne by the teacher, to be offset against higher anticipated earnings. Tailor-made courses will \nbe developed so that teachers can continue to teach while upgrading their qualifications. An \narrangement has already been reached with the Higher Secondary Education Board and DOE \nto accredit pre-service and in-service teacher training and link with their regular education \ncourses. \n87.  To enhance career prospects and motivation, two separate professional career paths will \nbe offered to basic and secondary teachers. There will be four stages (beginner, experienced, \nmaster, and expert) for both basic and secondary level teachers. Provisions will be made to \n ", "  21 \nupgrade teachers based on indicators such as time on task, seniority, qualification, training, and \nstudents\u2019 achievement in their respective career paths. \n88.  SSR will also address certain aspects of teacher recruitment and deployment. Additional \nteachers will be recruited through per capita funding25 to reduce pupil\u2013teacher ratios gradually in \nan effort to reduce class sizes and overcrowding. Furthermore, teacher positions in overstaffed \nschools  will  not  be  refilled  and  will  be  reallocated  to  overcrowded  schools.  SSR  will  also \ncontinue the recruitment of relief teachers (Rahat Darvandhi). \n89.  Social  inclusion  within  the  teacher  profession  is  also  a  key  priority.  Policies  and \nprograms have been developed promoting the recruitment of female teachers at different levels \nsuch  as  ECED  centers,  basic  education,  and  secondary  education.  These  include  special \nprovisions for females entering the teaching profession such as provisions for maternity and \npaternity leave, infant feeding breaks, and provision for substitute teachers. At secondary level, \nthe plan seeks to increase the proportion of female teachers to 25% (from the current 13%) and \nthe proportion of female head-teachers to 10%. The number of teachers from disadvantaged \ngroups will be increased by such measures as weighting criteria for teacher and management \nselection in favor of candidates from these groups. This will require a particular effort and policy \nchanges under SSR. \n90.  Teacher development activities are expected to achieve the following results by 2012: \n(i)  the percentage of certified teachers will increase from 91% (2008) to 95% for \nbasic and secondary education; and \n(ii)  the percentage of teachers with the required qualification will rise from 66% \n(2008) to 79% for basic education and from 77% (2008) to 86% for secondary \neducation.  \n7.  Capacity Development, Management, and Monitoring and Evaluation \n91.  To deliver the education services as envisioned under SSR, capacity development both \nat the institutional level and organizational level are required. The Government is finalizing a \ncomprehensive  capacity  development  plan  and  aligning  it  with  SSR  activities  and \nresponsibilities.  Capacity  development  efforts  under  SSR  will  focus  more  on  local  level \ndevelopment of capacity than under EFA. This is in line with increased decentralized planning \nand management. Capacity development of schools will be linked to achieving the minimum \nenabling conditions. Low performing schools will be identified and assisted in the preparation \nand implementation of quality improvement plans. Capacity development will be supported by \nmore than 1,000 cluster resource centers that have been established throughout the country. \n92.  System-level capacity to deliver education services will be enhanced through increased \ninvolvement of communities in the management of schools. This presents a continuation of \nactivities initiated under EFA. The number of schools transferred to local communities will be \nincreased  under  SSR.  Capacity  development  will  also  be  focused  on  enhancing  the \nmanagement  capacity  of  SMCs.  The  EFA  evaluation  study  (footnote  4)  found  that  not  all \ncommunities are ready to take on management of schools.  \n93.  The SIP is another tool that has been introduced under EFA to develop capacity at the \nlocal level to plan and manage school operations. All schools are expected to prepare a SIP \nannually as a mandatory requirement for release of the funds that will provide textbooks and \nother resources. The EFA evaluation study found that, while SIPs are prepared by almost all the \n                                                 \n25 Per capita funding of salaries is a student enrollment-based funding (as opposed to teacher-based funding). Per \ncapita funding was introduced in Nepal in 2007 in an effort to enhance quality and efficiency through increased \nschool choice (for children), competition among schools, and efficient teacher deployment. \n ", "22 \n \nschools, their use for planning and budgeting is very limited. Under SSR, the Government \nintends to strengthen the use of SIPs; and linkages between the SIPs, village education plans, \ndistrict education plans, and the ASIP will be strengthened. The allocation of funds to schools \nwill be based on the SIP. In addition, social audits will be made compulsory for all schools to \nreceive funds in the next fiscal year. \n94.  Program management aims to ensure timely and inclusive delivery of education services \nand products. It aims at improving a number of areas that have been identified as crucial for \nsmooth and timely operation of the school system and achievement of SSR goals. These \ninclude the timely delivery of textbooks, and the timely disbursement of scholarships to students \nand salaries to teachers. These form part of the GAAP within the JFA. Key targets include (i) an \nincrease in the percentage of students receiving textbooks within 2 weeks of the school session, \n(ii) an increase in those receiving scholarships of different categories within these 2 weeks, and \n(iii) a reduction in the number of weeks delay in providing salary payment to teachers. \n95.  In  view  of  the  multiple  changes  being  introduced  under  SSR,  careful  monitoring, \nevaluation, and appropriate feedback mechanisms are important to identify what works, and \ncorrect what does not work. In addition to the regular reports that have been produced under \nEFA (including status reports, flash reports, FMRs), the Government is introducing periodic \nstudents\u2019 assessments to monitor progress in quality of education, client satisfaction surveys, \nand  regular  program  evaluations.  During  the  program  period,  two  rigorous  sample-based \nlearning assessments at grades 3, 5, and 8\u2014undertaken in partnership with a specialized \ninternational testing agency or firm\u2014and two comprehensive impact evaluation studies will be \ncarried out. The Education Review Office will be tasked with conducting external audits of \nagencies at different levels and will report to the EPC.  \nC.  Important Features \n96.  Development partner harmonization through program-based approach. SSR builds \non  and strengthens  the  PBA  initiated  under  EFA,  which  involves  full  development  partner \nharmonization. The majority of development partners pool their funding for the single sector \npolicy and expenditure program through a JFA. Over time, the number of development partners \ncontributing through the pooled funding arrangement has increased from 5 in 2004 to 9 in \n2008.26 In addition, a number of other development partners provide parallel cofinancing to the \nsame program outside the pool arrangement.27 Development partners largely rely on\u2014and \nhence provide the mechanism for strengthening of\u2014country systems and in-country regular \nmechanisms  for  program  reporting,  budgeting,  financial  management,  and  procurement. \nReporting requirements are fully harmonized among development partners. The PBA was also \nfully applied in the preparation process for SSR. Development partners only conducted joint \npreparation and appraisal missions. Based on ADB\u2019s concept of the program policy matrix, \ndevelopment partners developed a joint broad policy matrix to track progress on key policy and \nstrategic actions necessary for program implementation. Development partners providing policy-\nbased support\u2014including ADB, the Department for International Development (DFID) of the \nUnited Kingdom, and the European Commission\u2014committed to select only policy actions from \nthis broader policy matrix as tranche release conditions. The PBA consortium in Nepal is also \nunique in the sense that no single development partner takes a lead role. The function of donor \nfocal  point,  which  coordinates  in  communication  with  the  Government  and  serves  as  a \nspokesperson for the development partners, rotates among pooling partners on an annual basis. \n                                                 \n26 As of FY2008, JFA pooling partners are ADB, Australia, Denmark, the European Commission, Finland, Norway, \nthe United Kingdom, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Bank.  \n27 The non-JFA partners who are part of the PBA through parallel financing are the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency;  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization;  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development; and the World Food Programme. \n ", "  23 \nThis system has helped to strengthen government leadership and has established a collegial \nrelationship among the partners. \n97.  ADB support through program cluster approach. The ESP uses the program cluster \napproach to support the SSR program. The program cluster approach provides a flexible way of \nsupporting the Government\u2019s complex phased reform plan. Recognizing that reform is a phased \nand  cumulative  process,  the  program  cluster  allows  for  timed  and  gradual  support  to  the \nmultiple phases of the SSR program. It also provides a certain level of predictability to the \nGovernment of ADB\u2019s intended support. \n98.  Allocated budget support. The ESP uses the program lending modality adjusted to the \nprogram-based approach features specific to the SSR program. ADB\u2019s contributions to the SSR \nprogram are released in two stages. In the first stage, ADB program tranches are released to \nthe government foreign currency account upon fulfillment of tranche release conditions. In the \nsecond stage, funds are committed and disbursed to the actual SSR program. Funds are \ncommitted by development partners on an annual basis before the beginning of each fiscal year, \nthrough the review of an annual rolling plan, the ASIP, and the AWPB. Funds are then released \non a trimester basis upon submission by the Government of a trimester FMR. As such, release \nof the funds by the development partners for the next year\u2019s activities is contingent upon \nsatisfactory progress on outcome and process performance indicators during the previous year.  \nD.  Financing Plan \n99.  The SSR program cost is estimated at $2.6 billion for the first 5 years of the SSR \nprogram period.28 The SSR program cost includes all regular recurrent and investment costs for \noperating the subsectors covered under the SSR program, as well as the additional costs \nassociated with the SSR reform. The currently projected available funding over the same period \nis estimated at $2.3 billion, excluding ADB\u2019s proposed assistance. This amount is based on a \nprojection of macroeconomic growth, the government budget and revenue generation, the share \nof the education budget in the total budget, and tentative development partners\u2019 contributions. \nThe projection has accounted for current macroeconomic conditions and is based on projections \nof historic trends of government financing of the education sector.  \n100.  It is proposed that under subprogram III, a grant of $70 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources and a loan equivalent to $25 million in special drawing rights from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources will be provided. The loan will have an amortization period of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% per year during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter. The terms and conditions for the grant and the loan will be as set forth in the \nFinancing Agreement. The program support amounts are determined by factors including (i) the \nimportance of SSR in the education sector in Nepal; (ii) ADB\u2019s overall lending program to Nepal; \n(iii) the availability of alternative sources of financing; and (iv) the financing gap, which impedes \nachievement of the SSR goals. The grant and loan amounts meet part of the financing gap. The \nproposed increase in program cluster amount would accommodate the increased amount for \nsubprogram III from $25 million to $95 million. Table 2 presents the SSR financing plan.  \n101.  The Government has assured that education remains a priority sector and that sufficient \nbudget will continue to flow to the education sector during the macroeconomic downturn. In the \nevent  that  additional  resources  cannot  be  identified  to  bridge  the  financing  gap,  further \nprioritization of the SSR implementation plan in light of the existing funding gap may be required \nat  the  annual  programming  stage.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  committed  to  the \ndevelopment of a comprehensive and strategic sector financing plan. Appendix 6 contains more \ndetails of the financial analysis.  \n                                                 \n28 The corresponding cost over the 7-year program period is $4.1 billion. \n ", "24 \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan, FY2010\u2013FY2014 \n($ million) \nExpenditures and Financing  Amount  \nSSR Expenditures  2,626.0   \nFinancing Sources    \nGovernment Budget Allocation  1,864.0  \nAsian Development Bank   95.0  \nOther Development Partners\u2019 Assistance   393.4  \nTotala  2,352.4   \nFinancing Gap  273.6  \nFY = fiscal year, SSR = school sector reform. \na Contributions  from  non-pooling  partners  and  tentative   \n further  ADB  support  to  the  SSR  program  would \n contribute to further narrowing the financing gap.  \nSource: ADB estimates.   \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n102.  Program management. MOE is the Executing Agency and the DOE is the Implementing \nAgency. The ESP subprogram III will follow the program management arrangements specified in \nthe revised JFA for SSR. The JFA details the goals of the SSR program; the responsibilities of the \nGovernment and the development partners; the funding mechanism; and fiduciary requirements, \nincluding procurement, reporting, monitoring and auditing, and other administrative requirements. \nThe JFA development partners meet regularly to review the financial and operational status and \nprogress of SSR, and to commit and disburse funds. The SSR JFA has adopted the provisions of \nthe EFA JFA, while the following areas have been strengthened: (i) an enhanced monitoring and \nevaluation function with the development of regular evaluations; (ii) a biannual fiduciary review of \nthe program, covering financial management and procurement, conducted by the World Bank on \nbehalf of the pooling partners; (iii) a biannual performance audit performed by the Office of the \nAuditor General (OAG); and (iv) inclusion of a GAAP.  \n103.  Implementation period. The ESP subprogram III will support the SSR program from \nFY2010 to FY2012. The program period will be from August 2009 to July 2012. It is expected \nthat program completion will be in July 2012 and the closing date will be December 2012.  \n104.  Disbursement, procurement, and recruitment. The proceeds of the grant and loan will \nbe disbursed to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) as the recipient in accordance with the provisions \nof ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans.29 The grant and loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding ineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral \nsources. No supporting import documentation will be required if, during each year that grant and \nloan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of total imports minus imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of the grant and loan expected to be \ndisbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with its \nwithdrawal request.  \n105.  The pooled foreign currency account (FCA) in the name of the Government of Nepal \nestablished at the Nepal Rastra Bank under the SSR JFA will function as the deposit account \ninto which all withdrawals from the grant and loan account will be deposited. The deposit \naccount will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with terms and conditions \n                                                 \n29 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "  25 \nsatisfactory to ADB. Under the SSR JFA, the JFA development partners have agreed to use the \nexisting  government  system  for  disbursement  and  accounting  of  pooled  government  and \ndevelopment partner funds. MOE will use the Government\u2019s reporting system to submit the \nFMR to the pooled development partners each trimester. Replenishment of the funds from the \nFCA will be based on the timely and accurate submission of the FMR. Program funds will be \nmade available in two steps. Firstly, grant and loan proceeds will be deposited in the FCA in \naccordance  with  the  respective  provisions  of  the  financing  agreements  between  the \nGovernment and the respective pooled development partners. While the funds will be pooled, \neach pooling partners\u2019 accounts will be recorded, reconciled, and reflected separately in the \nFMR. Under government procedures, no direct payments can be made from the FCA. Secondly, \nfunds  will  be  transferred  from  the  FCA  to  the  Government\u2019s  consolidated  fund  based  on \nsubmission of actual expenditures by MOE. However, MOE will transfer the funds from the FCA \nto the Government\u2019s consolidated fund only upon receipt of the approval of the FMR from the \npooled development partners. \n106.  Procurement of eligible items and recruitment of consultants will be based on standard \ngovernment procurement and recruitment practices acceptable to ADB for procurement and \nrecruitment by the Government or its representatives. \n107.  Counterpart  funds.  The  local  currency  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the \nprogram grant and loan will be used by the Government to supplement the cost associated with \nimplementation of the SSR program. \n108.  Anticorruption policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProgram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in the grant and loan regulations. As detailed in the SSR JFA, a performance-related \naudit of SSR will be carried out by the OAG every 2 years.  \n109.  At the time of the EFA program preparation, a collective risk assessment was conducted \nby the World Bank in collaboration with the other JFA development partners. Overall program \nrisk  was  rated  medium  in  terms  of  financial  management  and  program  implementation.  A \nfinancial management review was conducted by the World Bank in conjunction with the EFA \nmidterm  review.  It  concluded  that  the  budgeting,  accounting,  and  reporting  procedures \nelaborated  in  the  FMR  provide  assurance  that  EFA  complies  with  financial  management \nrequirements  in  an  acceptable  manner.  However,  there  are  financing  issues  in  that \ndisbursements to districts and schools (i) are often late, (ii) are sometimes in inappropriate \namounts,  (iii)  sometimes  lack  clarification  on  how  the  amount  has  been  determined,  and \n(iv) may lack clear guidelines on how the money should be spent. \n110.  To mitigate the risks of corruption and ensure good governance in implementation of the \nSSR, the Government and pooling partners agreed to a set of actions referred to as the GAAP, \nwhich  will  address  governance  and  accountability  issues  related  to  management  of  SSR, \nfinancial  management,  procurement  management,  and  social  accountability  tools.  Activities \nrelate to identified areas that require improvement in performance, including (i) improvement in \ntextbook distribution; (ii) timely distribution of grants; (iii) timely distribution of scholarships; \n(iv) financial management at central, district, and school levels; (v) procurement at central and \ndistrict  level;  (vi)  enhancing  social  audits;  (vii)  enhancing  school  audits;  (viii)  carrying  out \nperformance  audits;  (ix)  implementation  of  transparency  and  disclosure  measures;  and \n(x) human  resource  management.  The  SSR  JFA  with  the  GAAP  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. The financial management assessment of the SSR JFA is in Appendix 8. \n ", "26 \n \n111.  Tranching  and  monitoring. The grant and loan will be released in two tranches of \n$45 million and $50 million. The first tranche will be released to the Government upon fulfilling all \nfirst tranche release conditions and upon the effective date of the Financing Agreement, and will \nbe disbursed fully from the grant resources. The second tranche is expected to be released within \n18  months  of  the  release  of  the  first,  subject  to  compliance  with  second  tranche  release \nconditions. The second tranche will be a combination of the balance of the grant resources \n($25 million) and the loan ($25 million). Funds will be released from the FCA to the government \nconsolidated fund based on submission of actual expenditures by MOE.  \n112.  Accounting, auditing, and reporting. MOF and the Financial Comptroller General Office \n(FCGO) will be responsible for the financial management of pooled government and development \npartner funds for the EFA program. The FCGO is providing access to its financial management \ninformation system to the DOE to ensure timely production of financial reports. This will enable the \nDOE staff to prepare reports on SSR accounts, which are identified by specific budget codes in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s cash-based accounting system. These reports will be verified \nby the FCGO before submission to the pooling partners for their review. To strengthen the \nfinancial  management  arrangements  further,  the  Government  has  committed  to  the \nimplementation  of  a  financial  management  improvement  plan,  as  provided  in  the  GAAP,  to \nstrengthen capacity in the DOE, MOE, and other program cost centers. Financial and audit \nprovisions are also included at the school level. \n113.  The  ESP  subprogram  III  will  be  audited  by  the  OAG  in  accordance  with  auditing \nstandards. The audited statements will be provided to the partners within 9 months of the end of \neach fiscal year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of grant and loan proceeds and verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n114.  Key reports that the Government has agreed to provide include (i) financial statements \non a trimester and annual basis; (ii) annual performance reports; (iii) interim financial monitoring \nreports for the first fiscal trimester; (iv) consolidated reports of the previous fiscal year showing \nprogram outcomes; (v) Flash reports on outcomes and processes twice during each academic \nyear; (vi) annual audit reports of the SSR program as certified by the OAG; and (vii) the ASIP \nand AWPB.  \n115.  Program  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  Government  and  the \ndevelopment  partners  have  agreed  to  a  set  of  indicators  to  monitor  implementation  and \noutcomes in accordance with the SSR implementation plan, covering the key aspects of the \nprogram.  A  comprehensive  monitoring  matrix  with  annual  targets  for  outcome  and  output \nindicators  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  The  monitoring  of  SSR  will  largely  rely  on \ninformation collected through the education management information system, which is used to \nprepare the Flash I and Flash II reports, the annual status report, and an annual consolidated \nreport. This will be supplemented by available data from nationally representative household \nsurveys. In addition, MOE and DOE will partner with other agencies and firms to carry out a \nnumber of quantitative and qualitative studies on specific topics. In addition to these regular \nreports,  SSR  proposes  to  carry  out  sample-based  nationally  representative  student  tests, \nadministered  by  an  independent  agency,  at  grades  3,  5,  and  8\u2014in  partnership  with  an \ninternational testing agency or firm and the national Curriculum Development Center. These \nlearning  assessments  will  be  carried  out  early  during  program  implementation  (2010)  and \ntoward the end of the program implementation period (2013). SSR will also further develop the \nsystem of decentralized monitoring, including social audit, and the provisioning of external \nevaluation of outcomes and impact of SSR. The impact of the program will be evaluated at \nmidterm and during the last year of the SSR program.  \n ", "  27 \n116.  Program review. Review arrangements for SSR will be very similar to the modality used \nunder EFA. One joint annual review will be held annually in April. The review will assess \nimplementation progress with respect to outcomes and expenditures. The ASIP for the next \nyear will be presented by MOE at this review. Development partners will commit to funding \nlevels for the next year based on the previous fiscal year\u2019s progress, and subject to subscribing \nto the ASIP. A joint consultative meeting will be held in December of each year, during which \nthe signatories to the JFA will review the preliminary consolidated financial statements for the \nprevious fiscal year as well as financial and output reports for the first trimester of the current \nyear. MOE and DOE and the development partners have also agreed to hold quarterly meetings \nto address key issues that may arise during implementation and/or on specific issues, such as \nthose identified in the policy matrix and GAAP. \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Program Benefits and Impacts \n117.  Economic benefits. Three distinct economic benefits can be identified as a potential \nresult of the SSR program: (i) increased access to education, resulting in more workers in the \nfuture with at least 8 years of schooling and with higher earnings as a result; (ii) enhanced \neducation quality and relevance, resulting in higher productivity and earnings on the part of \neveryone  who  has  completed  basic  education;  and  (iii)  improved  internal  efficiency  in  the \neducation system.  \n118.  For  basic  education,  item  (i)  will  result  in  a  total  of  300,484  additional  students \ncompleting basic school education in Nepal\u2019s public schools over the 5 years of the program \nbeing appraised. As for item (ii), regression analysis suggests that increased quality may result \nin a 5% increase of the average annual earnings of those with basic education.  \n119.  To measure a change in item (iii), education\u2019s internal efficiency, the analysis required \nan estimation of the number of student-years needed to produce a student who completes basic \neducation. In a perfectly efficient 8-year system, with no repetition and no dropout, all children \nentering grade 1 would finish the course 8 years later. However, it currently takes an average of \n11.5 student-years for a student to complete the 8-year basic education course, so 3.5 years of \nthe 11.5 years (the costs of which must be covered from the budget) are in a sense wasted \nyears. Given the assumed reductions in repetition and dropout rates as a result of the SSR \nprogram, by the end of the full 7 years of reform, it is anticipated that it will take only 9.73 years \non average for a student to complete basic education. Appendix 6 contains the summary \neconomic and financial analysis, while Supplementary Appendix C contains the economic and \nfinancial analysis. \n120.  Social benefits and poverty impact. The ESP subprogram III will also generate social \nbenefits among the socially and economically disadvantaged. Better access to an affordable \nand quality education, and better learning achievements will ensure that these groups are able \nto  generate  the  necessary  human  and  social  capital  to  build  economically  and  socially \nresponsible lives. A shift to an egalitarian and inclusive education system will help to relieve the \nroot causes of conflict and social tension, build social cohesion, and contribute to social stability. \nImproved access to postprimary and basic education for girls and women will enhance women\u2019s \nroles in the political, economic, and social spheres. Successful implementation of SSR is closely \nlinked to the process of peace building in the country. Investment in education in Nepal, in the \nwake of signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, is considered a key measure of \nconflict prevention.  \n \n \n ", "28 \n \nB.  Program Risks \n121.  Macroeconomic risks. Macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth are \ncrucial for the Government to be able to allocate sufficient recurrent budget to education. In the \ncurrent macroeconomic environment, funding for education should not be compromised. The \nGovernment has accorded high priority to the education sector and has committed to ensure \nthat adequate funding will continue to be allocated to the SSR program. Similarly, continued \ncommitment and cooperation from development partners will be crucial for the sustainability of \nSSR. However, this risk is considered minimal, as existing development partners have a long \nhistory  of  assisting  education  in  Nepal,  and  new  development  partners  have  tentatively \nexpressed interest in providing support to the SSR program. If budget cuts are necessary, the \nGovernment  intends  to  phase  the  pace  of  reform  in  line  with  the  budget  availability.  Key \npriorities (such as the provision of free basic education) will continue to be the focus of the \nprogram, while other components (such as secondary education reform, construction activities, \nteacher qualification upgrading, and other activities that can be implemented independently) will \nbe phased or scaled down in line with the available funding. Development partners will have the \nopportunity to review the SSR implementation plan on an annual basis with the submission of \nthe ASIP and AWPB. \n122.  Fiduciary  risks.  A  recently  updated  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability \nassessment30 assessed that Nepal\u2019s overall fiduciary risk level remains high. It concluded that \n(i)  the  quality  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  public  financial  management  and \nprocurement in Nepal ranks among the best in Asia, (ii) implementation of that framework is \nproblematic,  and  (iii)  development  partner  practices  tend  to  reinforce  rather  than  tackle \nimplementation weaknesses. However, the financial management arrangements outlined in the \nJFA  assist  the  Government  in  addressing  public  financial  management  weaknesses  while \nreducing the overall risk level to an acceptable level. The JFA and GAAP adopted under SSR \nfurther strengthen fiduciary oversight mechanisms and reduce the risk of corruption.  \n123.  Political  risks.  While  the  scope  for  a  more  conducive  political  environment  has \nimproved since the end of the conflict in 2006, peace building and reconstruction continue to \nconstitute  a  fragile  process  that  entails  political  risks.  Delay  in  development  of  the  new \nconstitution could slow down the decentralization plans for the education sector and the transfer \nof authority to the local level. As a risk mitigation measure, the system will continue to operate \nunder current implementation arrangements. Moreover, the education sector and the envisioned \nreforms have broad political support. The security situation in some parts in the country remains \na difficulty in the delivery of education services, and the democratic process remains fragile. \nDelivery of education services in the Terai (lowlands) is particularly affected. Nevertheless, \nsuccessful implementation of the ongoing programs has demonstrated the resilience of the \neducation system under adverse circumstances. \n124.  Program risks. As SSR is a major reform program, resistance to change from within the \nsystem, as well as outside the system, could be expected. Vested interests and dissenting \nopinions may slow down or divert the reform process. This risk has been mitigated throughout \nthe design process by seeking wide stakeholder feedback and inputs, and the process is \nsupported at a high political level through cabinet approval of the SSR core document. As such, \nstrong opposition to the required changes in the education act is not expected. \n125.  Another internal program risk emanates from the wide scope of the SSR program. The \nGovernment will have to be careful to withstand pressures to spread resources over a wide \n                                                 \n30  DFID. 2008. Fiduciary Risk Assessment: Nepal. Kathmandu. Footnote 8 of this report states that the 2008 DFID \nfiduciary risk assessment requires a four-option opinion as to whether fiduciary risk is low, moderate, substantial, or \nhigh. The previous scoring was based on a three-option opinion (low, medium, or high). \n ", "  29 \nrange of activities, especially by expanding certain programs that divert resources from the core \nmandate of MOE. Continued focus on the key guiding principles that have been set out during \nthe development of the SSR program will mitigate this risk.  \n126.  Compliance  with  social  safeguard  policies.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 9. An environmental assessment is in Supplementary Appendix D \nand a poverty assessment of the policy actions is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n127.  Environment.  The  proposed  program  falls  into  environmental  category  C.  An \nenvironmental assessment of the policy interventions (Supplementary Appendix D) shows that \nmost of the proposed policy actions will not impact the environment, while the policy action \naiming to make access to education more equitable might have some very minor impacts \nrelated to school and classroom construction. Insignificant environmental impacts that might \narise  during  implementation  of  the  program  include  dust  and  noise  pollution  from  building \nconstruction activities, and contaminated water extraction from school wells\u2014both of which can \nbe mitigated easily. The Government follows a National Environmental Guideline for School \nImprovement and Facility Management for site selection, and for designing and monitoring \nconstruction of school buildings and facilities such as sanitation for girls. This will prevent \nnegative impacts such as arsenic and fluoride contamination in drinking water, construction in \nsensitive ecological regions, air quality, and waste management. The ESP subprogram III is \nexpected to contribute positively to the environment by providing school latrines, and improving \nhygiene practices among children and youth. \n128.  Involuntary  resettlement. The proposed program falls into involuntary resettlement \ncategory C. There will be no involuntary land acquisition or resettlement. Two activities under \nSSR may give rise to voluntary land acquisition: (i) the financing of classrooms, libraries, and \nlaboratories in schools; and (ii) activities that help construct administrative buildings, such as \nDEO  offices.  Land  for  school  construction,  if  required,  will  be  acquired  through  voluntary \ndonation  by  the  beneficiary  community.  It  is  likely  that  the  land  that  will  be  needed  for \nadministration buildings is already registered in the name of MOE or the Government. However, \nif private land needs to be acquired, this will be done only through a willing buyer\u2013willing seller \napproach. A framework for land acquisition through voluntary donations or willing buyer\u2013willing \nseller processes (Supplementary Appendix F) was formulated (i) to establish voluntary donation \nand  willing  buyer\u2013willing  seller  procedures,  including  recording  the  process  and  disclosing \ninformation regarding the voluntary donation and willing buyer\u2013willing seller approach; and (ii) to \nensure that the Government will acquire land for the DEO and other buildings by following only \nthe willing buyer\u2013willing seller approach. \n129.  Indigenous peoples. The proposed program falls into indigenous peoples category B \nas it will have positive impacts on indigenous peoples. The Program will consider them as \ndisadvantaged groups together with other disadvantaged groups. A vulnerable communities \ndevelopment  framework  has  been  formulated  to  ensure  that  specific  actions  are  taken  to \nengage these groups in program planning through meaningful consultations at each stage of \nprogram implementation, and to enable them to share the benefit of the proposed program with \nother project beneficiaries. Appropriate specific actions will be formulated and implemented \nduring project implementation. The summary vulnerable communities development framework is \nin Appendix 10, while the complete framework is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n \n \n ", "30 \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n130.  In addition to the continued compliance and implementation of the actions specified in \nthe Program\u2019s policy matrix and standard assurances, the Government has given the following \nspecific assurances, which will be incorporated in the Financing Agreement: \n(i)  The Government will ensure the satisfactory implementation of the Program and \nwill fully comply with the actions set out in the policy matrix that need to be \ncomplied  prior  to  the  second  tranche  (Tranche  2)  to  enable  the  release  of \nTranche 2. The Government will submit documents, in a form satisfactory to ADB, \nas evidence to demonstrate compliance with each of the actions set out in the \npolicy matrix. \n(ii)  The Government will (a) carry out the policies and actions in accordance with the \nschedule of policy reforms contained in the policy matrix and ensure sustainability \nof the reforms beyond the program period, (b) carry out all of its obligations as \nstipulated under the Financing Agreement in a timely manner, and (c) ensure that \nthe agreed actions are taken with respect to each policy achievement. \n(iii)  The Government, through MOE and DOE, will implement, manage, coordinate, \nand monitor the Program in accordance with its goals, responsibilities, funding \nmechanism,  fiduciary  requirements,  and  other  program  management \narrangements as set forth in the SSR core document, SSR plan and agreed in the \nSSR JFA. \n(iv)  The Government will carry out the actions agreed between the Government and \nthe Pooling DPs, as set out in the GAAP and attached to the SSR JFA, to address \ngovernance  and  accountability  issues  relating  to  the  management,  financial \nmanagement,  procurement  management  and  social  accountability  tools  of  the \nSSR. \n(v)  Within 1 month of the Effective Date, MOE will have recruited consultancy services \nand commissioned a study to analyze constraints in implementing the local content \ncurriculum. The study shall make recommendations to effectively implement the \ncurriculum. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that the Counterpart Funds will be used to support the \neducation  sector  reform  and  to  supplement  the  cost  associated  with \nimplementation of the SSR Program. \n(vii)  Throughout the program period, the budget allocations for education will remain at \nleast at the level of FY2008, while all efforts will be made to increase the budget \nallocation. \n(viii)  The Government will endeavor that (a) critical program staff shall remain in their \nposition on a full-time basis for a reasonable duration to ensure continuity in the \nimplementation  of  the  Program;  and  (b)  all  implementing  agencies  shall  be \nadequately staffed and provided with the necessary financial, technical, and other \nresources to perform their functions under the Program. \n(ix)  The Program will make all possible efforts to avoid land acquisition. In the event \nthat land acquisition becomes necessary for the implementation of the Program, \nthe Executing Agency will ensure that such land is acquired only on a voluntary \nbasis in accordance with the procedures outlined in the approved Framework for \nLand  Acquisition  through  Voluntary  Donations  or  Willing  Buyer\u2013Willing  Seller \nProcesses (Supplementary Appendix F). \n(x)  MOE and DOE will implement, manage, coordinate, and monitor the Program in \naccordance with the Vulnerable Communities Development Framework agreed \n ", "  31 \nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB  (and  the  derived  Gender  and  Vulnerable \nCommunities Action Plan) to enable the program-affected vulnerable groups\u2014\nparticularly girls, indigenous peoples, and ethnic minorities\u2014to benefit equally from \nthe Program. \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that the activities carried out under the Program will \nbe in full compliance with current environmental laws and regulations of Nepal and \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). If any unexpected significant environmental \nimpact of the Program is identified during the program period, MOE and the DOE \nwill  prepare  satisfactory  environment  review  documents  such  as  initial \nenvironmental  examination  or  environmental  impact  assessment  and \nenvironmental  management  plan,  and  obtain  ADB\u2019s  endorsement  of  the \ndocuments. The Government will consult ADB for the public disclosure of the \ndocuments. \n(xii)  In line with the SSR JFA, the Government, through MOE and DOE, will provide \nADB with all relevant data and information in such detail as ADB may reasonably \nrequest to facilitate review by ADB and the development partners, who are parties \nto the SSR JFA, of the progress in the implementation of the Program. \nB.  Condition for Grant and Loan Effectiveness \n131.  The following is the condition for program grant and loan effectiveness:  \n(i)  All conditions for the release of the first tranche, as specified in the policy matrix, \nhave been complied with to the satisfaction of ADB.  \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n132.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  grant  and  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n(i)  the increase in the program cluster amount from $65,000,000 to $135,000,000; \n(ii)  the  grant  not  exceeding  $70,000,000  to  Nepal,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, for subprogram III of the Education Sector Program, on terms and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nFinancing Agreement presented to the Board; and \n(iii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 16,092,000 to \nNepal for subprogram III of the Education Sector Program from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially

Appendix 2  35 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \nA.  Nepal Education System and its Outcomes   \n  1.  The Education System  \n1.  The  current  education  system  of  Nepal  consists  of  preschool  and  early  childhood \neducation  and  development  (ECED);  5  years  (grades  1\u20135)  of  primary  education;  3  years \n(grades 6\u20138) of lower secondary education; 2 years (grades 9\u201310) of secondary education; and \n2 years (grades 11\u201312) of higher secondary education, technical education and vocational \ntraining (TEVT), tertiary education, and adult literacy. A school leaving certificate (SLC) is \nawarded by a national examination at the end of grade 10, and a high school leaving certificate \nis awarded at the end of grade 12. Schools are categorized into four types: (i) community-aided \n(public schools that are fully supported by the Government for teachers\u2019 salaries and other \noperational costs), (ii) community managed (public schools that are fully supported by the \nGovernment for teachers\u2019 salaries and operational costs but whose management responsibility \nis undertaken by the community), (iii) community unaided (public schools that receive partial \nsupport from the Government), and (iv) institutional schools (private schools supported entirely \nby parents and trustees). In addition to these categories, religious schools such as Madarsa \n(Islamic), Gumba (Buddhist), and Gurukul (Hindu) offer mostly primary education. Alternative \nschooling is provided through the School Outreach Program for ages 6-8, Flexible Schooling \nProgram for ages 8-14 and Urban Out-of-School Program covering children aged 6 to 14.   \n2.  At  central  level,  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  is  responsible  for  overall  policy \ndevelopment, planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the education sector. Under MOE, \nschool  education  is  administered  by  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE),  through  District \nEducation Offices (DEOs) in the 75 districts. DEOs are responsible for ensuring the flow of \nfunds to schools for salaries as well as distribution of provisions such as textbooks and teacher \ntraining activities. DEOs work through resource persons in resource centers, which provide \nmonitoring and professional support to a cluster of 10\u201325 primary schools. At the community \nlevel, school management committees (SMCs)\u2014composed of parents, community members, \nand school administrators\u2014play significant roles in the management of schools. In the case \nof  community  managed  schools,  SMCs  take  responsibility  for  the  recruitment  and \nmanagement of teachers as well as resource mobilization. Higher secondary education is \nmanaged separately under the Higher Secondary Education Board, while administration of \nTEVT  is  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Council  for  Technical  Education  and  Vocational \nTraining (CTEVT).  \n3.  Successive governments have given high priority to education, particularly to meet the \nlearning  needs  of  the  most  disadvantaged  children.  The  Education  Act  of  1971  and  the \nEducation Regulation of 2002 state that primary education is to be provided free of charge for \nall children enrolled in community schools. In lower secondary and secondary education, free \neducation is provided for girls as well as for Dalit and Janajati children whose family income \nfalls below the poverty line. Moreover, the Interim Constitution of 2007 entitles each citizen to \nreceive free education up to the secondary level, and each community has the right to provide \nbasic education in its mother tongue to preserve its script and cultural heritage. Extensive \nscholarship programs and other incentive schemes have been provided to support schooling of \ndisadvantaged children at primary and secondary level. Mother tongue instruction in five major \nlanguages has been introduced in primary education. Decentralization of education is also a key \npolicy  of  the  Government.  The  7th  amendment  of  the  Education  Act  of  2001  provides \ncommunities, through the SMCs, with formal rights to manage primary schools to improve \nequitable access and quality. The Government has introduced several schemes to promote \ndecentralization at community level, which include decentralized selection and appointment of \nteachers based on a credible teaching licensing system, and direct channeling of non-salary \nrecurrent costs to the SMCs. \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \n \n  2.  Overall Sector Outcomes  \n4.  Consistent efforts to support education, social inclusion policies, and decentralization \nstrategies have contributed significantly to expand participation in education at all levels. As \nprimary education enrollment has reached more than 90%, and primary completion has reached \nabout 76%, demand for postprimary education has increased. From 2001 to 2008, the net \nenrollment  rate  (NER)  for  primary  education  rose  from  81%  to  92%.  The  NER  for  lower \nsecondary education rose from 42.9% to 52.3%, while the NER for secondary education grew \nfrom 29.5% to 34.7%. The NER for higher secondary education was 11% in 2008. The average \nannual growth rate was about 3.5% for primary enrollment, 2.4% for lower secondary, and 7.4% \nfor secondary from 2001 to 2006. Gender parity has improved, with girls representing 49.5% of \nprimary enrollment, 48.2% of lower secondary enrollment, and 47.2% of secondary enrollment \nin 2008 according to the 2008 Flash I Report.1 Although enrollment rates of Dalits and Janajatis \nhave not been systematically tracked until very recently, available data indicate that the \nenrollment of these groups has increased substantially over the past 5 years. Nevertheless, \ngender, caste, and ethnic disparities in enrollment increase with the level of education. Poverty \nremains a major barrier in access to education of the most disadvantaged groups.  \n5.  Improving internal efficiency of the public school system, especially in the early grades \nof primary education, remains a challenge. The grade 1 gross intake rate was 148% in 2008, \nreflecting  substantial  underage  and  overage  enrollment.  This  creates  overcrowding  of \nclassrooms  and  impedes  the  pedagogical  process.  In  turn,  it  becomes  a  factor  for  high \nrepetition and dropout rates. Repetition rates have slightly improved since 2001, but 28% of \ngrade 1 children repeated the year in 2008. The survival rate to grade 5 was 73% in 2008, and \nthe transition rate to lower secondary was 77%. The SLC pass rate for students from community \nschools has ranged from 25% to 35% over the past decade. In 2006, SLC pass rates recorded \na net improvement of 62% over the previous year. However, 90% of private school students \npass SLC examinations as opposed to 51% of public school students in 2007. \n6.  Students\u2019 learning outcomes are difficult to assess in the absence of a reliable learning \nachievement test. However, student achievement in primary and lower secondary education is \nfound to be weak.  Comparison between a national assessment conducted in 2008 and a \nprevious assessment in 1999 show continued weakness in Mathematics and English, relative \nstrength in Social Studies, and a decline in Nepali mean scores. The 2008 national assessment \nshowed that grade 5 students master less than half of the material specified in the curriculum \nframework specifications grid for each grade and subject area, and 16% of the sampled schools \nhad achievement levels below 30%. There were also significant variations between students \nfrom different socioeconomic and ethnic groups\u2014indicating that the education system did not \ncompensate for differences in geographical, social, and economic backgrounds. \n7.  Overall, Nepal has been successful in steadily improving access to education at all \nlevels  while  narrowing  gender  and  social  disparities  in  enrollment.  However,  low  internal \nefficiency and indication of poor learning outcomes suggest that further effort is needed to \nimprove the quality of education, and to address the needs of the most disadvantaged groups. \nThe education divide persists between urban, rural, and remote areas as well as between \nchildren from well-off and less well-off families. \nB.  Trends and Challenges \n1.  Basic Education and Early Child Development  \n8.  One  of  the  major  thrusts  of  the  School  Sector  Reform  (SSR)  is  to  expand  basic \neducation from grades 1 to 8 and to make it gradually free and compulsory. This entails multiple \nchallenges: (i) sustain gains in participation in and provision of primary education; (ii) continue \n                                                 \n1 Department of Education, Government of Nepal. 2008. Flash I Report 2065 (2008\u20132009). Kathmandu. \n ", "  Appendix 2  37 \nprogress in improving the quality of primary education and reach the 8% of children who are out \nof school, and (iii) meet the increasing demand for affordable postprimary education of good \nquality.  \n9.  Early  childhood  education  and  development. In 2008, the gross enrollment rate \n(GER) for ECED reached 63.4%. The percentage of grade 1 students with ECED experience \nwas up to 36.2% in 2008 from 8.0% in 2001. However, investments in ECED have not yet \nreturned value in terms of increased efficiency by reducing underage enrollments in grade 1 and \nlowering repetition rates in early grades. This could be attributed to the persistent enrollment of \nunderage and overage children in grade 1 diluting the impact of ECED investments on lowering \ngrade 1 repetition rates, or the poor quality of ECED curriculum and services. International \nresearch indicates that ECED is particularly effective in preparing marginalized children for \nsuccess in school. The failure to cater to the most excluded groups because the ECED centers \nare concentrated in relatively developed areas could also be undermining ECED\u2019s effect on \nimproved efficiency.  \n10.  Effective  targeting. Targeted interventions, such as scholarships for girls and Dalit \nchildren,  contributed  to  increased  enrollment  among  these  groups.  However,  performance, \nparticularly of the Dalits, needs attention as their pass rates and promotion rates are low. \nGender and socioeconomic gaps widen markedly in the transition from grade 5 to lower \nsecondary. These trends suggest that more assertive targeting and a comprehensive support \nprogram are needed to improve the retention, progress, and academic achievement of children \nfrom disadvantaged groups. This would, in turn, help improve the internal efficiency of the \nsystem. Factors typically affecting schooling of marginalized children are a combination of \npoverty, gender, and caste-related social barriers; and academic support that is not sufficiently \nadjusted  to  their  language  and  culture.  Therefore,  a  combination  of  various  strategic \ninterventions is needed, most of which have been already introduced under the system: (i) \nscholarships and other incentive schemes, (ii) deployment of female teachers and teachers from \ndisadvantaged groups, and (iii) mother tongue instruction in the early grades. Special support \nfor early grades teaching and systematic academic support to disadvantaged students would \nhelp sustain enrollment and average learning outcomes. This would include special remedial \nprograms for overage grade 1 children to join the age-appropriate classroom. Strict enforcement \nof the policy of non-enrollment of underage children at grade 1 would also help improve grade 1 \nefficiency. \n11.  Quality. Key factors affecting school quality are (i) poor learning environment, including \novercrowded classrooms in some areas; (ii) lack of sufficient number of qualified teachers; \n(iii) late delivery of textbooks; (iv) insufficient teacher support and supervision, which lead to \npoor pedagogical process and low teacher motivation; (v) rigid instructional provision that does \nnot  take  into  account  the  needs  of  a  socioculturally  diverse  population;  and  (vi)  weak \nmanagement and monitoring capacity at school and district level. A comprehensive Technical \nReview of School Education2 conducted in 2006 indicated that on average 54% of students \nreceived a full set of textbooks and 3% a partial set within the first week of the school session. \nIn terms of physical facilities, 76% of the schools had drinking water and 78% had toilet facilities; \n36% of the schools had separate toilets for girls.  \n12.  The increase in the number of teachers has not kept pace with the increase in student \nenrollments. Many schools have insufficient teachers, both in terms of reaching a minimum \nteacher per school ratio and reaching subject teacher norms set by the Government. Of greater \nconcern  is  the  regional  imbalance  in  the  distribution  of  teachers.  While  about  half  of  the \nmountain and hill districts suffer from severe teacher shortages, the rest have vacancy levels of \n10% or less, or even surpluses. While many valley districts have surpluses, almost all districts in \n                                                 \n2  MOE. 2006. Technical Review of School Education. Kathmandu.  \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \n \nTerai have vacancies. Overall, the unequal distribution of teachers and low motivation level of \nteachers indicate the absence of an effective teacher deployment and management system.  \n13.  Under SSR, the aspiration and pressure of achieving the goal of free and compulsory \nbasic education might drive access to grades 1\u20138 faster than the internal mechanisms for policy \nformulation and strategic planning for improving quality can absorb. As access to grades 6\u20138 \nwill increase faster than access to grades 1\u20135, the tradeoff between mass access and average \nquality at upper primary education has serious potential. Evaluations of past primary education \nprojects  and  programs  also  acknowledged  the  slow  progress  in  the  quality  of  education \ncompared to the rapid expansion in access. Key steps needed to pursue the quality agenda \nwould be to (i) develop a clear framework of norms and standards for quality, including technical \nstandards  for  school  inputs,  instructional  processes,  and  outcomes;  (ii) identify  reliable \ninstruments  to  measure  cognitive  learning  outcomes;  (iii)  further  analyze  and  develop  a \ncomprehensive plan for qualification upgrade, selection, recruitment, and management of basic \neducation teachers; and (iv) develop implementation strategies for quality improvement that \nwould rely on incentives and an accountability mechanism, particularly at the local level.   \n2.  Secondary Education and Technical Education and Vocational Training  \n14.  For  decades,  apart  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  a  few  bilateral \nagencies,  the  Government  and  most  education  development  partners  have  considered \nsecondary education as a subsector to be addressed only after achieving universal primary \neducation.  When  SSR  shifted  the  strategic  focus  from  primary  to  basic  education  and \nintroduced the concept of an integrated grade 1\u201312 system, secondary education began to be \nviewed as a necessary extension and upgrading of basic education. However, policy choices \nfor secondary education are more complex than for basic education. Thus, careful analysis of \nthe implication of such policy choices would be required before implementation of secondary \neducation restructuring will begin under SSR. \n15.  Secondary education financing. The Interim Constitution, enacted in 2007, states that \nfree secondary education will be provided by the state. However, at present, secondary schools \ncollect tuition. In the case of community schools, students pay NRs500 or more per year \nwhereas institutional lower secondary and secondary schools collect NRs4,000\u2013NRs12,000 or \nNRs6,000\u2013NRs12,000 per year per student depending on the institution. In addition, each \nschool collects various kinds of fees for extracurricular activities such as sports and special \ntraining, as well as for maintenance of facilities such as libraries and laboratories. Moreover, \ncommunity unaided schools currently receive only partial support from the Government, so \ncommunities contribute to teacher salaries and operational costs. Although recent data on the \nshare of household and community contribution to secondary education are not available, it is \nanticipated that such a cost-sharing mechanism for secondary education may need to continue \nto maintain the current system. It also means that the plan for further expanding secondary \neducation will require a more careful and comprehensive sector financing plan.  \n16.  Quality. Expansion of secondary education has significant cost implications in terms of \nquality.  Implementation  planning  must  therefore  take  quality  issues  explicitly  into  account. \nMinimum  service  standards  for  secondary  education  are  to  be  more  specific  in  terms  of \ncurriculum and textbooks, number of subject teachers with appropriate qualifications, education \nfacilities such as libraries and laboratories, equipment, instructional materials, and processes. \nThe Secondary Education Support Project3 also showed the importance of hostel facilities in \nschools in remote areas. Therefore, a national framework of norms and standards will need to \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Secondary \nEducation Support Project in the Kingdom of Nepal. Manila.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  39 \nbe  developed  for  secondary  education  that  includes  textbooks,  curriculum,  instructional \nprocesses, and teacher development. \n17.  Since the National Curriculum Framework (grades 1\u201312) was approved in 2006, lower \nsecondary and secondary curricula and textbooks have been revised. The new curricula are \nmore  functional  and  accentuate  problem-solving  approaches  based  on  practical  needs. \nHowever,  in  terms  of  teacher  skills,  there  is  a  mismatch  between  learning  needs, \ncompetencies, and skills demanded from students in the modern economy and the teaching \nskills  of  Nepal\u2019s  secondary  teachers.  Teacher  shortages  negatively  affect  the  quality  of \nsecondary education and create a barrier to expansion of access to secondary education. \nComprehensive policies to attract and retain high-quality secondary education teachers should \nbe devised. Such policies should factor in remuneration, professional development issues, \nteacher deployment and class size policies, and accountability systems. \n18.  Higher  secondary  education.  Currently,  there  are  community  higher  secondary \nschools, private higher secondary schools, and public higher secondary programs affiliated with \nuniversities. In 2006, the Government amended the Education Act and the Higher Secondary \nEducation Act with the intention of integrating higher secondary education with the school \nsystem. Implementation of this policy has been slow, and secondary education and higher \nsecondary education are still managed by two separate agencies\u2014the DOE and the Higher \nSecondary Education Board. This split has contributed to poor coordination between the two \nlevels. The phasing out of the public higher secondary programs from the universities, when \nhigher secondary education merges with the school system, will add complexity in secondary \neducation restructuring. As higher secondary schools have been traditionally established and \nfunded by nongovernment funds, the status and financing of higher secondary education will be \nsubject to much debate in SSR. To date, the Government has not established any higher \nsecondary schools, and has not supplied teachers to higher secondary schools, but it has been \nproviding a limited amount of grants for teachers\u2019 salaries to community higher secondary \nschools.  \n19.  Technical education and vocational training. Nepal has a long history of TEVT\u2014\nboth school-based and as an independent stream. Higher technical education is provided by the \nuniversities. More sector-specific training programs are offered by different sector departments \nsuch  as  cottage  and  small  industries  and  tourism.  Excluding  the  universities,  there  is  an \nestimated national training capacity of about 50,000 trainees annually. The school-based TEVT \nbegan in 1971, with the expectation to develop students\u2019 marketable skills upon completion of \nschool education. However, this program could not be sustained and the concept of trade \nschools under CTEVT was developed. Some schools are developed as annex schools affiliated \nwith CTEVT. Currently, such annexes have 798 students in total.  \n20.  The parallel provision of vocational subjects in schools is not yielding the desired results \nfor several reasons: (i) inadequate and outdated skills of graduates; (ii) limited and restrictive \nchoices of vocational subjects; (iii) inadequate preparedness and limited workshop facilities in \nthe schools, with inadequate maintenance and replacement of teaching equipment; (iv) very \nlimited interaction with the private sector; (v) inadequate number of teachers with hands-on \nskills; and (vi) inadequate funding for recurrent expenditures. The cost of providing TEVT in \nschools is quite prohibitive\u2014annual learning costs could be less than NRs10,000 for general \nschool education but as high as NRs100,000 per student for TEVT. This suggests that school-\nbased TEVT that involves extensive investment in physical infrastructure, equipment, and highly \nspecialized technical teachers is not an adequate option in Nepal. A more limited but relevant \nrole of TEVT in school education will be explored under SSR\u2014i.e., the development of soft \nemployability skills to prepare for and orient schoolchildren toward future employment. \n \n ", "   \nSTATUS OF EDUCATION FOR ALL IMPLEMENTATION  4\n0\n    Benchmark  Status  Status  Status  Status  Status  Target   \n Goals and Performance Targets  2001  2003  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009 \n1.

This appendix provides an economic rationale for investing in the school sector reform \n(SSR) program. It analyzes the financial and budgetary affordability of the program, and projects \nthe sustainability of the education system beyond the SSR program period. 1 \nA.   Economic Analysis of SSR \n2.  The economic analysis of the initial 5 years of the SSR program compares the benefits \nand costs of the SSR program as opposed to the counterfactual or \"without-program\" scenario \nin which the Government of Nepal\u2019s program for the school sector is an extrapolation of the \nspending and activities of the recent period during which Education for All (EFA) was being \nimplemented. The SSR investment being appraised is the estimated addition to sector spending \n(both development and recurrent spending) caused by implementation of the SSR program. The \nbenefits are taken to be those changes in the quantity and quality of education produced over \nthe period of the program as a result of SSR, as well as any savings attributable to reductions in \n\u201cwastage\u201d (repetition and dropout) of students in the system. Underlying all of the analysis are \nprojections of (i) Nepal\u2019s 5-year-old age cohorts2, (ii) gross intake ratios of children into grade 1, \nand (iii) repetition and dropout rates in all grades (1\u201312).   \n1.  Benefits of School Sector Reform Program \n3.  Three distinct benefits as a result of SSR can be identified and will, to the extent \npossible,  be  quantified:  (i) increased  education  quantity  (increased  access  to  education, \nresulting in more workers in the future with at least 8 years of schooling and with higher \nearnings as a result); (ii) enhanced education quality and relevance (more learning, resulting in \nhigher productivity and earnings on the part of everyone who has completed basic education); \nand (iii) enhanced education\u2019s internal efficiency (less \u201cwastage,\u201d i.e., fewer school dropouts and \nrepeaters, and lower unit costs as a result).   \n4.  Increased education quantity. SSR will result in more children entering the education \nsystem, who will repeat and drop out less. As a result, more students will complete basic and \nsecondary education. Based on higher intake rates and lower repetition and dropout rates, over \nthe 5-year period, SSR will result in 300,397 more students completing basic education (grade 8) \nin Nepal\u2019s public schools, and 47,387 more secondary education graduates.  \n5.  Regression results based on household survey data3 show that a Nepali wage worker \nwho  has  completed  basic  education  earns  about  2.5  times  more  than  a  worker  who  has \ncompleted less than basic education. The first cohort of additional graduates (those finishing \ngrade 8 in FY2010 will be eligible to enter the labor market in FY2011. In FY2011 prices, the \n250% earnings differential amounts to about NRs25,300 per year. This differential was then \nassumed to grow by 5% in every future year, in line with anticipated inflation. Aggregating the \nwage differentials of all five cohorts yields a discounted present value (DPV)4 of $771.7 million.5 \n6.  Enhanced education quality and relevance. This benefit applies not only to additional \ngraduates but to almost 2.3 million students who will complete basic education from FY2010 to \nFY2014. The 2003/04 Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS, footnote 3) included no direct \n                                                 \n1  The economic and financial analysis is a collaborative exercise conducted by staff and consultants of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank. \n2  An age cohort is defined as a group of people having the same age in a given year. \n3  Government of Nepal, Central Bureau of Statistics. Nepal Living Standards Survey 2003/04 (NLSS). Kathmandu. \n4  Taking 12% to be the opportunity cost of capital and discounting the stream of benefits by this rate. \n5  Applying the same methodology to the benefits expected to accrue to additional secondary school graduates would \nyield a DPV of $919 million, which is even larger owing to the sizable earnings differential seen in the NLSS \nbetween secondary school graduates and those with less education.  \n ", "  Appendix 6  53 \nmeasure of the quality of schooling received in the past by adults wage earners, nor did it \nspecify whether an individual attended a public or private school. It was therefore assumed that \nan individual\u2019s place of birth, which in most cases indicates where an individual went to school, \ncould be used as a rough proxy for education quality\u2014on the assumption that those living in \nurban areas are, on average, more likely to attend a good quality school than those living in \nrural areas. While far-from-perfect as a measure of school quality, the location variable was the \nbest indicator available in this case. Studies of unit costs in a large number of developing \ncountries have shown conclusively that average spending per student is strongly correlated with \nthe urban\u2013rural divide.  \n7.  Regression analysis indicates that, if holding years of schooling and experience are \nconstant, a person who comes from an urban area earns about 10% more than a person from a \nrural area. Of course, someone who was born in an urban area is more likely to live and work in \nan urban area today, and some of the difference in earnings must be attributed to differences in \nthe demand for skills in urban and rural areas, but it was decided that half of the difference \ncould be attributed to differences in the quality of education received. From this assumption, 5% \nof the average annual earnings of those with basic education (as observed in the 2003/04 NLSS \nand allowed to grow at the rate of inflation) was taken to be a measure of the \u201ceducation quality \npremium\u201d and was used to assess the impact of overall improvements in system quality as a \nresult of SSR.   \n8.  As with the quantity benefit, the earnings of the student beneficiaries (those who will \ncomplete basic education from FY2010 to FY2014) were tracked for 20 years into the future. \nThe DPV of the benefit stream amounts to $428.8 million.6 \n9.  Enhanced internal efficiency. To measure a change in education\u2019s internal efficiency, \nthe analysis estimated the number of student-years needed to produce 1 (or 1,000) basic \neducation completer(s). In a perfectly efficient 8-year system, with no repetition and no dropout, \nfor every 1,000 children entering grade 1, 1,000 would finish the course 8 years later. Currently \nin Nepal, it is necessary to use 11.5 student-years to produce one graduate of the 8-year basic \neducation course\u2014so 3.5 years of the 11.5 years (the costs of which must be covered from the \nbudget) are in a sense wasted years. \n10.  Given the assumed reductions in repetition and dropout rates as a result of the SSR \nprogram, at the end, only 9.73 student-years will be needed to produce 1 basic education \ngraduate, generating savings of 1.77 fewer student-years. To assign a monetary value to the \nsavings,  unit  costs  were  computed  for  each  year  of  the  5-year  program,  by  dividing  the \nprojected number of students by the projected basic education costs in that year. The DPV of \nthis benefit stream amounts to $78.3 million.  \n2.   Discounted Present Value of Program Costs \n11.  To compute the additional expenditures required to generate the benefits described \nabove, the costs of the education sector in the without-program scenario are estimated, and \ncompared to the SSR program costs. Figure A6.1 shows two versions of the public costs of the \nschool sector during the 5 years being appraised: (i) those according to a without-program \nscenario, and (ii) the higher costs needed to implement the SSR program. The first is an \nextrapolation of Ministry of Education (MOE) spending on school sector activities over the last 5 \nyears.  The  year-by-year  differences  between  the  two  expenditure  profiles  comprise  the \n\u201cinvestment\u201d  being  appraised  here.  The  annual  amounts  are  shown  in  Figure  A6.2.  The \nadditional expenditure, over and above the without-program scenario, by the Government and \nthe development partners for the SSR program over the next 5 years amounts to $446.3 million. \n                                                 \n6  The DPV of the comparable (quality) benefit stream for secondary school graduates is $563 million. \n ", "54  Appendix 6 \nFFiigguurree  AA66..11::  CCoossttss  ooff  SScchhooooll  SSuubbsseeccttoorr  ((EECCEEDD,,  PPrriimmaarryy   FFiigguurree  AA66..22::  IInnvveessttmmeenntt  CCoossttss  bbyy  YYeeaarr\naanndd  SSeeccoonnddaarryy))  WWiitthh  aanndd  WWiitthhoouutt  SSSSRR 114400..00\n880000\n111199..88\n112200..00\n770000 662277..22 110055..22\n557777..88\nAmount ($ million)Amount ($ million)234562345600000000000000000000 334466338811....3366 444400773344....1155 445533227744....8844 447722..66 550077..44 Amount ($ millions)Amount ($ millions)110046846800000000........00000000 6633..33 7711..44 8866..66\n110000\n2200..00\n00\nFFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY\n22000055 22000066 22000077 22000088 22000099 22001100 22001111 22001122 22001133 22001144 22001155 22001166 00..00\nCCoossttss  wwiitthh  SSSSRR CCoossttss  wwiitthhoouutt  SSSSRR FFYY  22001100 FFYY  22001111 FFYY  22001122 FFYY  22001133 FFYY  22001144\nEECCEEDD  ==  eeaarrllyy  cchhiillddhhoooodd  eedduuccaattiioonn  aanndd  ddeevveellooppmmeenntt,,  FFYY  ==  ffiissccaall  yyeeaarr,,  SSSSRR  ==  SScchhooooll  SSeeccttoorr  RReeffoorrmm..\nSSoouurrccee::  AADDBB  eessttiimmaatteess..

From NLSS data, it is possible to quantify both \nthe direct and indirect private (household) costs of education. Adding the private cost to the \npublic cost increases the additional expenditure, by the Government, development partners, and \nhouseholds for SSR to $576 million over the next 5 years. The DPV of the 5-year basic \neducation cost stream is $347.9 million.  \n3.  Net Present Value and Economic Internal Rate of Return of SSR \n13.  Based on a discount rate of 12%, Table A6.1 suggests that the DPV of the benefits \nexceeds the DPV of the costs, hence investment in SSR is profitable from a social perspective.  \nTable A6.1: Net Present Values at Different Discount Rates  \n($ million) \nDiscount rate \nDPV of Benefits and  12%  39.2% \nCosts    (EIRR) \nQuantity  771.7  102.4 \nQuality and relevance  428.8  45.1 \nInternal efficiency  78.3  35.7 \nCosts  347.9  183.2 \nNPV (Benefits\u2013Costs)  930.9  0 \n                                                  DPV = discounted present value, EIRR = economic        \n               internal rate of return, NPV = net present value \n                                                  Source: ADB estimates. \n14.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the investment amounts to 39.2%\u2014a \nrobust figure that almost certainly equals or exceeds the rate of return on most alternative \ninvestments that the Government could be considering at this time.  \n4.  Sensitivity Analysis \n15.  The key assumptions underlying the estimated EIRR in Table A6.1 are related to (i) the \nspeed of progress in achieving the internal efficiency targets (repetition and dropout rates both \nfalling nearly to zero), and (ii) the additional earnings associated with the completion of basic \neducation and with having attended school in an urban (higher school quality) rather than rural \n(lower school quality) area. The first alternative estimate (Table A6.2) assumes that progress \ntoward the internal efficiency targets is one-half of the original assumption. This results in an \nEIRR of 26.2%. The second alternative assumes that the earnings premiums associated with \ncompletion and quality are two-thirds of those assumed for the main EIRR estimate. This results \nin an EIRR of 32.3%. The last alternative estimate combines both sets of lower assumptions \n ", "  Appendix 6  55 \nand results in an EIRR of 22.8%. While the EIRR estimates under the more conservative \nassumptions are lower than the main EIRR estimate, even these reduced rates exceed the \nopportunity cost of capital at 12%. The results of the sensitivity analysis reinforce the conclusion \nthat the SSR program is a sound investment for Nepal. \nTable A6.2: Sensitivity Analysis \u2013 Alternative EIRR Estimates \nInvestment Scenario \u2013 Assumptions about benefits and costs  EIRR (%) \nA.

The economic analysis thus far has taken into account only those benefits associated \nwith the changes in quantity, quality, and internal efficiency expected in basic education (grades \n1\u20138). The benefits associated with secondary education (grades 9\u201312) have not been counted. \nAn estimate of the EIRR that takes into account all of the benefits associated with secondary \neducation, as well as the private costs (household outlays and opportunity costs) of secondary \neducation, is 62.5%, which is 23 percentage points higher even than the EIRR based on basic \neducation alone. The key explanation for the difference in the A and C estimates is the very high \nearnings  premium  currently  enjoyed  by  those  in  Nepal  who  have  completed  12 years  of \nsecondary education compared to those with just basic education or incomplete secondary.  \nB.  Financial Analysis \n17.  The estimation of the available budget for SSR in any year requires an estimate of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in the latest available year plus annual values for four parameters that \nmake up the simulation model: (i) the nominal (measured in current prices) GDP growth rate, \nwhich equals the real (measured in constant prices) growth rate times the rate of price inflation; \n(ii) government expenditure as a share of GDP; (iii) education\u2019s share of the government budget; \nand (iv) the school sector\u2019s (or SSR's) share of the education budget. \n18.  Budget  envelope  scenarios.  Three  estimates  of  the  simulation  model,  based  on \ndifferent parameter values, are presented here: scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (a \u201chigh case,\u201d a \u201cmedium \ncase\u201d and a \u201clow case\u201d). Scenarios 1 and 2 are based on a GDP estimate of NRs1,045.5 billion \nin FY2010 and a nominal growth rate of 10.8% thereafter.7 These were the values projected at \nthe end of 2008 by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the International Monetary Fund.  \n19.  The assumptions about other parameters of the model were based on an extrapolation \nof recent trends and on government policy statements. Figure A6.3 shows the recent trends and \nprojections of the Government\u2019s share of GDP and education\u2019s share of the government budget. \nThe Government\u2019s share of GDP has been increasing each year since FY2003. In view of \nNepal\u2019s recent success in increasing government revenue through better tax collection, MOF \nand the National Planning Commission project even higher government shares over the period \nfrom FY2008 to FY2016\u2014perhaps reaching 25% or higher. However, conservative financial \n                                                 \n7  Equal to 5.5% real growth times 5.0% inflation. \n ", "56  Appendix 6 \nanalysis for the SSR program assumes that government spending will reach 21% of GDP in \nFY2009 and remain at that level for the 7 years that follow.  \n20.  The Government has set a target of 20% for education\u2019s share of government spending \nbut MOE\u2019s share of the government budget has not exceeded 17% to date (Figure A6.3). This \nanalysis assumes that education\u2019s share of the budget will gradually approach 20% and reach \nthis target in FY2016. \nFFiigguurree  AA66..33::  GGoovveerrnnmmeenntt  SSppeennddiinngg  aass  SShhaarree  ooff  GGDDPP  aanndd  EEdduuccaattiioonn\u2019\u2019ss  SShhaarree  ooff  \nGGoovveerrnnmmeenntt  SSppeennddiinngg::  RReecceenntt  TTrreennddss  aanndd  PPrroojjeeccttiioonnss  ffoorr  SSSSRR\n2222\n2211..00 2211..00\n2211 2200..66\n1199..88 2200..00\n2200 1199..44 1199..55\n%)%) 1188..99 1199..00\ne\u00a0(e\u00a0(1199 1188..55\nagag 1188..00\nntnt1188 1177..44 1177..55\nPercePerce1177 1166..33 11117575....1818 11117575....2828 1166..22 1166..77 1166..00 1166..88 1166..66 1177..00\n1166\n1155\nFFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY FFYY\n22000022 22000033 22000044 22000055 22000066 22000077 22000088 22000099 22001100 22001111 22001122 22001133 22001144 22001155 22001166\nAAccttuuaallss BBuuddggeett PPllaannnneedd\u00a0\u00a0((SSSSRR))\nAAllllooccaattiioonnss\nGGoovveerrnnmmeenntt\u00a0\u00a0eexxppeennddiittuurree\u00a0\u00a0aass\u00a0\u00a0sshhaarree\u00a0\u00a0ooff\u00a0\u00a0GGDDPP\u00a0\u00a0((GGoovvtt%%GGDDPP))\nEEdduuccaattiioonn''ss\u00a0\u00a0sshhaarree\u00a0\u00a0ooff\u00a0\u00a0ggoovveerrnnmmeenntt\u00a0\u00a0bbuuddggeett\u00a0\u00a0((EEdduucc%%GGoovvtt))\nGGDDPP  ==  ggrroossss  ddoommeessttiicc  pprroodduucctt,,  SSSSRRPP  ==  SScchhooooll  SSeeccttoorr  RReeffoorrmm..\nSSoouurrccee::  AADDBB  eessttiimmaatteess..\n \n21.  The simulation model also estimates the school sector\u2019s share of the education budget \n(the share going to preschool education and grades 1\u201312). This share has remained quite \nconstant (86%\u201389%). The remaining 11%\u201314% of MOE\u2019s budget is spent on tertiary education, \ntechnical education and vocational training (TEVT), and libraries and for MOE operations. This \nanalysis assumes that the school sector\u2019s share will remain at 87.4%, the approximate level \nrecently, for all years of the program. \n22.  High case scenario. Using the parameter estimates discussed thus far yields the first of \nthe three financial envelope estimates\u2014the high case scenario (scenario 1), a 5-year envelope \nof $2.693 billion (Table A6.3). While this would be slightly more than enough to finance an SSR \nprogram of $2.626 billion, scenario 1 also assumes that the development partners will finance \n30% of the total cost of the SSR program, which would be an extrapolation of the average \ndevelopment partner\u2019s share to the EFA program. However, given the larger size of the SSR \nprogram compared to EFA, this requires development partner contributions of $808.0 million \nover the 5 years. At the time of the program\u2019s appraisal, the development partners that currently \nsupport Nepal\u2019s education system made tentative pledges amounting to about $488 million to \ncover the first 5 years of the SSR program.   \n23.  Medium case. Subtracting the difference between 30% of total funding according to \nscenario 1 and $110 million in each year of the program reduces the total financial envelope \nfrom $2.693 billion to $2.374 billion\u2014the basis for scenario 2 or the medium case scenario. If \nwe assume the medium case to be a realistic estimate of the budget envelope, this leaves us \nwith a financing gap of $253 million ($2.374 billion minus $2.626 billion). \n24.  Low  case.  Since  MOF  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  released  the  GDP \nprojections used in scenarios 1 and 2 at the end of 2008, the global economic situation has \n ", "  Appendix 6  57 \ncontinued to deteriorate. MOF lowered its estimates of Nepal\u2019s economic growth in the short to \nmedium term to real growth of 3.8%, which translates into nominal growth of 9.0% using the \nsame projected inflation rate of 5.0%. Scenario 3 or the low case scenario in Table A6.3, which \nreflects the lower GDP figures, shows a 5-year financial envelope of $2.353 billion. If this \nscenario is thought to be the most likely, it increases the 5-year budget gap by $21 million, \nmaking it $274 million. \n25.  Summary of financing gap. Table A6.3 summarizes the results of the affordability \nanalysis.   \nTable A6.3: Estimates of Financing Gap  \n($ million) \nFinancing  Financial Envelope  SSR Costs  Budget Gap \nScenario  7-year  5-year  3-year  7-year  5-year  3-year  7-year  5-year  3-year \n1.

The assessment is that, while a funding gap remains at this stage in the case of the low \nand medium case scenarios, this would be a manageable gap for the following reasons: \n(i)  MOF and the National Planning Commission have committed to consult with the \nMinistry  of  Local  Development  on  the  funding  of  education  through  local \ngovernments\u2019 grants. The Ministry of Local Development has already agreed to \nimprove its tracking of local development grants. Inclusion of Ministry of Local \nDevelopment contributions to education will help the Government to satisfy the \n20%  budgetary  guideline  for  education.  It  will  improve  the  manner  in  which \nallocations  are  made  to  schooling  activities  and  result  in  greater  budgetary \npredictability.  Estimates  of  local  development  spending  to  date  suggest  that \nrecent totals nationwide have been about $25 million per year.  \n(ii)  The Government has been quite successful during FY2009 in increasing revenue \ncollection. Even in the face of the economic downturn, this success could provide \nthe Government with more comfortable fiscal space in the future than in previous \nyears. \n(iii)  The Government has also signaled that it will focus on resource mobilization in \nthe  early  years  of  the  SSR  program,  and  hope  to  attract  new  development \npartners to education. In particular, it was agreed that an application will be made \nto the EFA Fast Track Initiative for a grant to help bridge the funding gap. The \nFast Track Initiative Secretariat has indicated that perhaps as much as $100 \nmillion could be secured from the Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund.  \n(iv)  The Government is keen to develop a comprehensive sector financing strategy in \nthe medium to long term, with more innovative partnerships with the private \nsector, including local and international nongovernment organizations. This is in \nrecognition of the fact that government alone cannot adequately finance Nepal\u2019s \neducation sector. \nC.  Sustainability of Education System after SSR \n27.  This section assesses the program\u2019s sustainability in the years that follow the SSR \nprogram period. For this exercise, SSR program costs are re-categorized along three levels of \nitem regularity: (i) recurrent costs, such as teachers\u2019 salaries and scholarships; (ii) costs that \nproduce capital assets with a short (2-5-year) working life, such as the development of curricula; \nand (iii) costs producing assets with a long working life, such as construction. \n ", "58  Appendix 6 \n28.  For the years after SSR, beginning with FY2017, it is assumed that activities in category \n1 will occur annually, whereas those in category 2 will occur only every 3.5 years, and those in \ncategory 3 every 10 years. As during the SSR program period, a 5% inflation rate is assumed. \nBecause development activities that occurred in a compressed fashion during SSR will occur \nless often after the program ends, the growth in the cost of the school sector will be slower after \nSSR (as shown by the flatter slope of the graph showing costs in Figure A6.4 from FY2017 to \nFY2025 compared with FY2010 to FY2016). \n29.  As for financing to cover the costs of the school sector after SSR, it is assumed that the \nfinancing from government and NGOs will grow at 9%\u2014the rate at which GDP is assumed to \ngrow  according  to  scenario  3.  By  FY2017  the  global  economic  situation  is  likely  to  have \nimproved, and Nepal\u2019s economic growth could be higher than this. In addition, the growth of \neducation spending could remain higher than (or could fall below) economic growth. The graph \nshowing financing in Figure A6.4 also assumes that development partner flows will end abruptly \nat the end of the SSR program, which is not likely to happen.   \nFFiigguurree  AA66..44::  CCoossttss  aanndd  FFiinnaanncciinngg  ooff  SScchhooooll  SSeeccttoorr  \nDDuurriinngg  aanndd  AAfftteerr  SSSSRR  ((NNRRss  mmiilllliioonn))\n112200,,000000\n110000,,336633\nn)n) 110000,,000000 9922,,007777\noo 8844,,447744\nmillimilli 7711,,1100007777,,449999\nRs Rs  8800,,000000 6622,,7766116655,,889999 7766,,2288668800,,110000 8844,,110055\nmount (Nmount (N 46460000,,,,000000000000 3344,,5522443377,,9955664411,,9955664466,,2222775500,,11776644559944,,,,33553344553355554488,,,,22771199004455550066,,,,33996622996655554499,,,,9977007722225599,,8844336655,,2222996699,,1199337722,,665533\n4444,,994499\nAA 4411,,000066\n3377,,446633\n3344,,227799\n3311,,442211\n2200,,000000 CCoossttss FFiinnaanncciinngg\n00\n00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 00 11 22 33 44 55\n11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 22 22 22 22 22 22\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22\nY Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y  Y Y \nFF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF\nSSSSRR PPoosstt--SSSSRR\nSSSSRRPP  ==  sscchhooooll  sseeccttoorr  rreeffoorrmm..\nSSoouurrccee::  AADDBB  eessttiimmaatteess..\n \n30.  Figure A6.4 suggests that the financing gap that exists on paper (at least for now, until \nthe gap is closed, as it must be from an ex-post perspective, by means of further cost-cutting or \nresource mobilization) could possibly continue for 3\u20134 years after SSR, but that this gap is likely \nto close and become a surplus by 2020. The excess financing in the outer years could be used \nto make further improvements in the quality of education, and gains in education access on the \npart of remaining disadvantaged groups.

Fiduciary Risk at the Country Level \n1.  Nepal\u2019s legal and regulatory framework for public financial management (PFM) ranks \nhigh among developing countries, but a gap exists between the framework and its practical \nimplementation.  The  resulting  fiduciary  risk  environment  is  assessed  as  high.  A  public \nexpenditure and financial accountability assessment (PEFA),1 carried out in September 2008 by \nthe  World  Bank  and  the  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United \nKingdom, concluded that Nepal\u2019s overall fiduciary risk level remains high; this was similar to a \n2007 assessment carried out by DFID.2 The risks are associated with inadequate monitoring, \npoor  capital  budgeting,  spending  outside  mainstream  reporting  systems,  bunching  of \nexpenditures in the last trimester, collusion of the contractors and intimidation at the time of \nsubmitting bidding documents, and the absence of local government bodies. However, the \nassessment also noted the existence of a number of credible reform programs in the areas of \ngovernment ownership and the institutional mechanism of a PEFA steering committee under the \nchair of the finance minister. As suggested in the 2008 fiduciary risk assessment, on the request \nof the Government, a joint World Bank and DFID public financial management mission was \nfielded in February 2009. The objective of the mission was to discuss the PEFA action plan, and \nprioritize and sequence actions in a platform approach around a set of mutually supportive \nmeasures  that  are  feasible,  realistic,  and  sustainable,  and  can  generate  results  in  PFM \nperformance. The mission, in coordination with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), reached an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  its  immediate  priorities  for  PFM  reforms,  including \ncapacity  building  requirements.  Reflecting  the  above  priorities  and  capacity  building \nrequirements, the Government is preparing a PFM strategy document. \nB.  Fiduciary Risk at the Sector Level \n2.  A fiduciary risk assessment in the education sector conducted by DFID in September \n20073 concluded that overall risk in the sector was high, mainly because of the absence of \neffective social and financial audits at the school level. Although these measures have been \nprovided for, some weaknesses remain because of limited monitoring of the schools, poor \nrecord keeping at the schools, and financial and time constraints on resource persons and \nschool supervisors. On the positive side, the assessment noted that the budget had shown a \nlarge  increase  in  expenditure  and  significant  improvements  in  budget  utilization  (100%  in \nFY2007). It also acknowledged that there was a credible program to improve the PFM system in \nthe Ministry of Education (MOE) through a Financial Management Improvement Action Plan, \nwhich is being monitored by several development partners. The 2008 DFID and World Bank \njoint  fiduciary  risk  assessment  (footnote  1)  noted  satisfactory  progress  on  the  Financial \nManagement Improvement Action Plan in the areas of preparation of a draft audit guide and \nstandards for the schools, formation of a social audit committee to ensure social audits in all the \nschools, revision of social audit guidelines and notification to the schools that the third trimester \nbudget would only be released upon the submission of the social audit report of the previous \nyear, the preparation of a plan for computerizing all district education offices (DEOs), and a \ncapacity development plan for DEO staff including accountants. However, it pointed out that \n                                                 \n1  DFID. 2008. Fiduciary Risk Assessment: Nepal. Kathmandu. Footnote 8 of this report states that the 2008 DFID \nfiduciary risk assessment requires a four-option opinion as to whether fiduciary risk is low, moderate, substantial, or \nhigh.

Fiduciary Risk at the Program Level \n1.  Education for All Program and Financial Management Progress \n3.  At  the  time  of  the  Education  for  All  (EFA)  program  preparation,  a  collective  risk \nassessment was conducted by the World Bank in collaboration with the other joint financing \narrangement (JFA) development partners. The overall program risk for education was rated \nmedium in terms of financial management and program implementation. During the approval of \nits additional financing for EFA in 2007, the World Bank conducted a fiduciary risk assessment \nand concluded that the risk was moderate. ADB conducted an assessment for approval of the \nESP subprogram II in 2007 and confirmed the moderate rating.4 \n4.  A financial management review was conducted by the World Bank in conjunction with \nthe EFA midterm review. It concluded that the budgeting, accounting, and reporting procedures \nin the financial monitoring report (FMR) provide assurance that EFA complies with financial \nmanagement requirements in an acceptable manner. Substantial progress was also noted in \nfinancial and social auditing at the school level. In coordination with the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants of Nepal, an audit guide and standards for school audit were prepared, and the \nDepartment of Education (DOE) is implementing school audits in accordance with the guide. \nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal is providing the necessary training to auditors \nat the regional level. At present, a school accounting manual is being prepared. DOE has also \nallocated budget for school audits in FY2009. Similarly, the social audit guide has been revised \nand a dissemination program to various districts is ongoing. The constitution of a social audit \ncommittee in each school is being ensured, and social audits are being carried out. However, \nthere are financing issues, as disbursements to districts and schools (i) are often late, (ii) are \nsometimes in inappropriate amounts, (iii) sometimes lack clarification on how the amount has \nbeen determined, and (iv) may lack clear guidelines on how the money should be spent. \n2.  School Sector Reform Program \n5.  SSR joint financing arrangement. SSR\u2019s JFA continues EFA\u2019s system of earmarked \nbudgetary  support  that  is  controlled  by  an  agreed  reporting  mechanism.  Except  for  some \nchanges, the JFA of the School Sector Reform program includes all the provisions of the EFA \nJFA. The following areas have been strengthened in the JFA: (i) an enhanced monitoring and \nevaluation function, with the development of regular evaluations; (ii) a biannual fiduciary review \nof the program, covering financial management and procurement conducted by the World Bank \non behalf of the pooling partners; (iii) a biannual performance audit performed by the Office of \nthe Auditor General; and (iv) the inclusion of a Governance and Accountability Action Plan \n(GAAP). The new clause on the GAAP (para. 8) will contribute toward good governance in the \nimplementation of SSR. The GAAP further strengthens fiduciary oversight mechanisms. In view \nof the additional control mechanisms adopted under the SSR JFA, fiduciary requirements are \ncomplied with in an acceptable manner.  \n6.  In  general,  SSR  implementation  follows  government  accounting  systems.  The \ngovernment  reporting  mechanisms  and  formats  were  assessed  and  considered  adequate. \nGovernment financial and procurement reports will therefore be used for financial monitoring \nand reporting, and semiannual reports will be used to measure outputs. The accounting and \nauditing standards are gradually being made compatible with international standards, and The \nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal has helped in developing auditing and accounting \n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2007.

The computerization of DEOs, by using newly developed accounting \nsoftware and newly introduced electronic data transfer mechanism, will largely help in timely \ncompletion and submission of FMRs. However, the JFA also requires accounting, reporting, and \nauditing requirements that are acceptable to ADB. It requires annual and semiannual progress \nreports detailing expenditures, outputs, outcomes, and processes for the period to be produced \nand submitted to the funding partners. The funding partners, including ADB, will review these \nreports  during  regular  meetings  and  joint  review  missions.  The  JFA  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. The main reports are as follows:    \n(i)  The  annual  strategic  implementation  plan  (ASIP)  and  annual  work  plan  and \nbudget (AWPB) are prepared annually and submitted to the JFA development \npartners at the beginning of each fiscal year. After reviewing and subscribing to \nthese reports, the partners commit to their annual contributions. \n(ii)  The  FMRs  are  a  set  of  financial  reports  detailing  actual  expenditures,  cash \nbalances,  and  cash  requirements  prepared  and  submitted  to  the  JFA \ndevelopment  partners  within  45  days  of  the  end  of  each  trimester  (every \n4 months). After reviewing this report, the funding agencies disburse funds based \non actual expenditures and forecasted cash requirements. \n(iii)  An unaudited annual financial statement is prepared and certified by the financial \ncomptroller general and submitted to the JFA development partners no later than \n6 months after the end of the fiscal year. \n(iv)  An annual audit of the annual FMR is performed by the Office of the Auditor \nGeneral and submitted to the JFA development partners no later than 9 months \nafter the end of the fiscal year. \n7.  Disbursement  arrangements.  Disbursements  are  made  in  two  steps.  First,  JFA \ndevelopment partners advance funds based on expected cash requirements into the foreign \ncurrency account in the name of the Government of Nepal established at the Nepal Rastra \nBank.5 While the funds are pooled, each pooling development partner\u2019s amounts are recorded \nand reconciled separately by MOE. Balances and reconciliations are reported in the FMR. No \ndirect payments for any transaction can be made from this fund. In the second step, funds are \nreleased from the foreign currency account to the Government\u2019s consolidated fund based on \nsubmission and approval of actual expenditures by MOE (as reported in the FMR). Funds are \nnot released until approval of the FMR is received from the pooling development partners. \n8.  Governance  Accountability  and  Action  Plan.  To  further  mitigate  the  risks  of \ncorruption and ensure good governance in the implementation of SSR, the Government and \npooling partners have agreed to a set of actions called the GAAP. The GAAP includes a number \nof actions, which will address governance and accountability issues related to management of \nSSR, financial management, procurement management, and social accountability tools. The \nGAAP Framework in Table A8 summarizes the agreed actions. The GAAP aims at (i) ensuring \nminimum enabling conditions in school education; (ii) improving financial management and \nprocurement procedures and their timeliness; (iii) strengthening the role of communities and \nconcretizing  the  decentralization  agenda  in  this  sector;  (iv)  institutional  and  capacity \ndevelopment,  and  human  resource  management;  (v)  performance  audits;  (vi)  disclosure \narrangements and a communication strategy; and (vii) guidelines for dealing with emergencies, \nconflicts, and crisis.  \n                                                 \n5  In addition to initial advance of the first two trimesters' expenditure estimates, there is also a provision in the new \nJFA for depositing a larger amount of funds for developing partners adopting a programmatic support modality. \n ", " \nTable A8: Governance and Accountability Action Plan Framework \nReporting   \nObjectives  Key  Activities  Key indicators  Frequency  Key Actions   Expected Results  \nIssue 1: Ensuring Minimum Enabling Conditions For School Education \n1.1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nEducation plays a vital role in human development and hence contributes to poverty reduction. In Nepal, education is \nconsidered a major means for poor households to escape from poverty. With external assistance, Nepal has made significant \nefforts in the education sector, and this has contributed to improvements in human development indicators. The Government\u2019s \ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has also stimulated more effort in improving the primary education \nsector, with the goal of achieving basic and primary education for all by 2015. Participation in education has improved \nconsiderably over the last 5 decades, especially at primary level. In 2008, the primary net enrollment rate reached 91.9%, \ncompared with 81% in 2001. However, high repetition and dropout rates and poor learning outcomes, especially among girls \nand socioeconomically disadvantaged groups (including indigenous and ethnic minority groups), are major concerns.  \nBuilding on the poverty reduction strategy of the Tenth Plan (2002\u20132007),a the Government's Three-Year Interim Plan \n(FY2008-FY2010)b  aims  to  build  self-sustaining  societies  free  from  absolute  poverty  through  economic  and  social \ntransformation based on social justice. Education is a key priority sector of the Government for overall development and \npoverty reduction. The long-term vision of the plan on education is to ensure access of all citizens to inclusive, equitable, and \nquality basic education. The plan emphasizes social inclusion in terms of gender, caste, and ethnicity in education to reduce \nsocioeconomic disparities. The Interim Constitution of Nepal of 2007 also recognizes basic education as a fundamental right \nand has made provisions for free education up to the secondary level.  \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program 2005\u20132009 for Nepalc is based on the Government\u2019s \nstrategic priorities as set out in the Tenth Plan, and focuses on promoting broad-based economic growth, inclusive social \ndevelopment, and good governance. The midterm review of the Country Partnership Strategyd in 2008 recognized the need \nfor more strategic interventions in the sectors of ADB assistance to respond to the changing context of the country and the \npost-conflict environment. Education is the priority sector of ADB assistance to the Government.  \nIn line with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and ADB\u2019s assistance strategy, the Program will support government \nefforts in poverty reduction. It will directly support progress toward Nepal\u2019s MDG targets in education. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                       Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention, Non-Income MDGs \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Interim Constitution of 2007 provides the right to free education for each citizen up to secondary level. The constitution \nalso establishes equity measures with the right to receive basic education in the mother tongue. The Tenth Plan (which \nembodies its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper) also identified social development, including improvement in education, as \none of the four pillars of Nepal\u2019s poverty reduction strategy; and aimed at improving access to, and quality of, education. The \nThree Year Interim Plan further emphasizes inclusive education and the right to education for women, disadvantaged groups, \nindigenous ethnic groups (Janajati), and disabled groups, by increasing their access from primary to higher education. \nThe Education Sector Program subprogram III will support the Government\u2019s school sector reform (SSR) program for effective \nand quality education during FY2010\u2013FY2012. The Program contains targeted intervention programs for inclusive education \nfocusing on girls, Dalits, disabled, and disadvantaged groups. It will especially benefit girls and socially discriminated and \ndisadvantaged  groups  by  providing  better  access  to  affordable  quality  basic  education\u2014enabling  better  educational \nattainment and social capital needed for better livelihoods.  \nAccording to the Nepal Living Standard Surveye the poverty incidence of Nepal reduced from 42% in 1996 to 31% in 2004. \nHowever, this decrease has been distributed unequally across development regions and different population sections of the \ncountry, resulting in increasing income inequality (Gini coefficient increased from 34.2% in 1996 to 41.4% in 2004). Poverty is \nclosely related to issues of geographic location, caste, and gender,; and there are high levels of socioeconomic disparities. \nEconomic and social outcomes are worse in rural areas, particularly in remote areas. Poverty levels are highest and access to \nservices lowest in the remote Mid-west and Far-west, with poverty incidence of 27% in the Western Region, 45% in the Mid-\nwestern, and 41% in the Far-western regions. Among the people living in extreme poverty, agricultural wage laborers remain \nthe poorest in Nepal (poverty incidence of 55%).  \nThe 11% drop in poverty is also distributed unevenly across different caste, ethnic, and minority groups. In the last decade, \npoverty declined most significantly in upper caste groups. While poverty declined by 46% in the upper caste Brahmin and \nChhetri group, it declined by only 21% among the lower caste Dalits, 10% among the hill indigenous ethnic groups, and 6% \namong the Muslims. The NLSS II data show that the poverty incidence of historically marginalized and socially excluded \ngroups\u2014Dalits, indigenous ethnic groups, and Muslims, who altogether constitute above 50% of the total population\u2014are \n ", "68  Appendix 9 \nhigher than that of Brahmins, Chhetris, and Newars and are above the national average. The incidence of poverty is 19% \namong Brahmins and Chhetris and 14% among Newars, compared with 46% among Dalits, 44% among hill indigenous ethnic \ngroups, and 41% among Muslims. Average household per capita consumption amongst Dalits, indigenous ethnic groups, and \nMuslims is also considerably lower than that of households of the upper caste and privileged groups. Literacy rates are lowest \namong the Dalits\u2014about 30% lower than literacy rates of high-caste Brahmins and 35% lower than Newar rates. At primary \nlevel, the share of Dalits\u2019 enrollment is only 18% and indigenous ethnic groups 38%.  \nThe SSR program will address poverty through inclusive provision of better quality education. As described in the economic \nand financial analysis, SSR will result in (i) increased education quantity (increased access to education, resulting in more \nworkers in the future with at least 8 years of schooling and with higher earnings as a result); and (ii) enhanced education \nquality and relevance (more learning, resulting in higher productivity and earnings on the part of everyone who has completed \nbasic education). In combination with the targeted strategies to mainstream children from disadvantaged communities into the \neducation system, SSR is expected to contribute to poverty reduction.  \n2. Design Features.  \nMajor policy strategies for inclusion in the SSR plan consist of multilingual education, targeted interventions for extremely \nmarginalized groups and communities, flexible as well as decentralized approaches, and differentiated treatment to facilitate \nand integrate the populations with diversity needs. \nThe SSR plan includes coherent implementation strategies, particularly in terms of reaching vulnerable communities. These \ninclude primarily the expansion of early childhood education and development (ECED) programs in poverty pockets, targeting \nthe children of vulnerable groups; promotion of education based on mother tongues; and enforcement of protection of the \nintegrity of all children, with special focus on Dalits, girls, and marginalized populations.   \nFree alternative programs such as nonformal education courses and traditional modes of education (Madarsa, Gumba, Vihar) \nwill also be supported to be better equipped and capable to provide education to those not able to attend formal schools for \ndifferent reasons. Apart from the above, incentives such as scholarships will be provided for children from economically and \nsocially marginalized families. The reform will focus on girls and women, and children from educationally deprived groups so \nthat they will participate equally and attain equitable results. \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nThe following policy actions will directly or indirectly contribute to more inclusive education, and will contribute to poverty \nreduction (more details are in Supplementary Appendix E): \n(i)  Ministry of Education (MOE) to prepare a phased implementation plan for free and compulsory basic education, including \na list of needed legislative changes and proposed timing for such changes; this will lower the financial threshold for basic \neducation to children from poor households.  \n(ii)  Cabinet to amend Teacher Service Commission Regulations and other relevant legislation to reserve an appropriate \nnumber of vacant positions for recruitment of female teachers and teachers from disadvantaged social groups; this will \nmake the teaching profession more accessible for women and for licensed teachers from disadvantaged backgrounds. \nCurrently, 35% of teachers in the primary level are female; 13% of teachers in the secondary level are female and 1.5% \nof teachers are Dalit. By 2014, it is envisioned that 50% of the teaching force will be women in the primary level, and 25% \nin the secondary level, with 10% female head teachers; and 5% will be Dalit teachers. \n(iii)  MOE to approve guidelines to ensure the policy on local content curriculum is enforced; this will lower the threshold to \neducation for children from remote areas who do not speak Nepali. \n(iv)  MOE to approve a time-bound action plan on upgrading the academic qualifications of teachers in basic education; this \nwill enhance the quality of education, enhancing the earning potential for graduates in the labor market. \n(v)  MOE to approve a liberal promotion policy with no holdback of students up to grade 3; this will enhance the retention of \nstudents in the education system. \n(vi)  MOE to approve school operational guidelines for grades 1\u20138, as well as provisions for alternative schooling, modalities, \nand multigrade schools; this will provide educational opportunities for children from different backgrounds, and for \nchildren in remote areas. \n ", "  Appendix 9  69 \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nSocial exclusion in Nepal takes form through various discriminatory practices based on caste, gender, ethnicity, and social \nand economic status, including other parameters of vulnerability. These constitute traditionally deep-rooted values and \nconvictions that affect vulnerable groups\u2014especially women and girls, Dalits, and ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities \nthrough various discriminatory practices. Exclusion of children with disabilities is also traditionally embedded.  \nIt is estimated that 8.1% of primary age children remain out of school\u2014including disadvantaged children, children with \ndisability, children facing extreme poverty, working children, conflict affected and displaced children, children affected by \nHIV/AIDS, etc. Despite substantial achievements made under the Education for All (EFA) program (2004\u20132009), children from \nvulnerable groups are overrepresented in the out-of-school population and remain a hard-to-reach group for reasons related \nto social distance rather than physical distance to the schools. \nSocial exclusion also affects the teaching profession. The composition of teachers by major ethnic groups is disproportionate \nto the corresponding population figures\u2014about 37.2% Janajatis and 15% Dalits. The percentage distribution of teachers is \n3.7% Dalits, 23.7% Janajatis, 8.4% Madhesis, and 1.5% disabled.  \nThe SSR program envisages a set of coherent implementation strategies, particularly in terms of reaching the vulnerable \ncommunities. Policies and strategies for enhanced social inclusion and a range of actions, including inclusive education and \naffirmative action, have been adopted in the Program. These include financial and pedagogical support and incentive \nschemes targeted to the schools as well as financial and in-kind support to families and children. Free alternative programs \nwill be provided for students who cannot attend formal schools. Special provisions will be made to cater to the needs of public \nschool students in Karnali Zone, one of the poorest areas in the country. SSR also provides for the recognition and support of \ncaste and cultural education sources like Gumbas, Vihar, Madarsas, and Gurukul, which will contribute to the education of \nchildren not attending mainstream education. SSR further intends to develop local content curricula, mother tongue materials, \nand instruction for early grades. Affirmative actions to increase the number of teachers from disadvantaged groups includes \nthe equitable allocation of positions for the recruitment of teachers and personnel in management positions from these \ngroups, and criteria for teacher selection weighted in favor of candidates from these groups. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nStakeholder involvement in the development of SSR was ensured within MOE, as well as at the central and local level. SSR \ndevelopment was led by a group of senior officials of MOE under the guidance of the interministerial education policy \ncommittee (EPC) involving the National Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Women and Social \nAffairs, and the Ministry of Local Development. SSR was developed by MOE and experts from the line agencies. The work \nwas supported by a number of thematic local experts. Consultations were carried out through coordination committees \nconstituted at central, regional, and district levels. Workshops were conducted at central and regional levels, inviting all \nstakeholders\u2014including  education  professionals,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  lawmakers,  organizations \nrepresenting child welfare, indigenous peoples, and gender and inclusion specialists. Intensive consultations were carried out \nat the district level and school level, involving political parties, school management committees (SMCs), village development \ncommittees (VDCs), NGOs, teacher unions, parent-teacher associations, etc. Stakeholder consultation entailed a lengthy \nprocess of consensus building among stakeholders with differing backgrounds and interests. \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \nCommunities, through the SMCs, are key actors in school governance. In community managed schools, management \nresponsibility for school operations is undertaken by the community. Currently, about 8,000 schools have been turned over to \ncommunities. School-based management is planned to be strengthened through empowerment of SMCs, which will report to \nparents on school performance and to the local government on compliance with regulatory requirements, including social \ninclusion, and financial and social audit. Local communities also play an active role in the provision of ECED education and \nliteracy programs. During implementation, DOE will also disclose to and consult with the relevant stakeholders at central level \nfor finalizing the annual strategic implementation plan (ASIP). Consultations will be organized at the district level for finalizing \nthe district education plans. At village level, the VDC will conduct consultations to finalize village education plans. \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nRoles and responsibilities of various stakeholders have been defined throughout the SSR plan. In line with increased \nresponsibilities for management at the school level, organizational capacity development activities under SSR heavily focus \non the development of capacity of local stakeholders.  \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nNepal has achieved visible progress on a number of key education indicators during the period of EFA implementation, which \nemphasized the education of marginalized groups. The net enrollment rate at primary level increased from 81% in 2001 to \n ", "70  Appendix 9 \n91.9% in 2008 while the Gender Parity Index increased from 0.60 to 0.97 over the same period. The ratio of female teachers \nincreased from 1.2 per school in 2003 to 1.8 per school in 2008. However, despite an increase in primary enrollment, girls' \nparticipation in higher education levels is less than boys because of sociocultural factors including restricted mobility, early \nmarriage, household work burden, and less importance given to girls\u2019 education. \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n  Gender plan          Other actions/measures  (Gender actions have been incorporated in the gender and vulnerable \ncommunities development framework)       No action/measure \nThe SSR plan emphasizes gender inclusiveness. Guided by the legal and policy framework, the plan spells out the policies \nand programs to enhance the participation of girl students and female teachers at different levels, such as ECED centers, \nbasic education, and secondary education. A vulnerable community development framework is adopted by the Program to \nprovide an enabling environment for girls to receive basic education. The framework includes a scholarship program for girls, \nespecially from marginalized caste and ethnic groups and regions, and improvements in basic facilities in schools to address \nthe needs of girls, such as separate toilets for girls and boys. Other policy provisions are made to increase female \nparticipation in the teaching profession, including provisions for maternity and paternity leave, infant feeding breaks, and \nprovision for substitute teachers. Affirmative action in governance and management will include proportional representation of \nwomen and people from disadvantaged groups on governance and management committees at all levels. Progress in gender \ninclusiveness will be monitored through the disaggregation of key performance indicators by gender. Specific gender-focused \nindicators have been included in the program design and monitoring framework.  \nIII.

In its efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for education, the \nGovernment has been emphasizing inclusiveness of education. The Education for All (EFA) \nprogram  (2004\u20132009)  has  achieved  good  progress  in  this  respect.  Building  on  the \nachievements of the EFA program, inclusiveness of education has been an integral part of the \nschool  sector  reform  (SSR)  design  process.  Important  lessons  were  learned  from  the \nimplementation and evaluation of the EFA program. Some 8% of the current school-going \npopulation in primary (age 5\u20139) and about 25% in basic education (age 5\u201312) remain out of \nschool. Children from vulnerable groups1 are overrepresented in the out-of-school population \nand remain a hard-to-reach group. Similarly, children from vulnerable groups tend to repeat \nmore and drop out faster than average. Regional differences in education outcomes are also \nrecognized. Social inclusion issues are not limited to students, but also affect teachers and \nschool management committees. Vulnerable groups are underrepresented in both categories. \nRecognizing these key issues, the Government has incorporated policies and strategies to \naddress these issues in the design of SSR from the outset. \n2.  The  vulnerable  communities  development  framework  (VCDF)  is  prepared  as  a \nsafeguard document to ensure that the SSR program is implemented with sufficient attention to \nissue  related  with  access,  equity,  quality  and  sustainability  of  education  services  for  the \nvulnerable groups and that these groups are in no way affected adversely due to program \ninterventions. The main objective of the framework is to facilitate and reinforce the use and \napplication  of  the  SSR  strategies  and  interventions  aiming  to  increase  inclusion  of  the \nvulnerable groups in education. \n3.  The  SSR  program  is  composed  of  seven  components  encompassing  the  following \nsubsectors  and  crosscutting  areas:  (i)  basic  education;  (ii)  secondary  education;  (iii)  early \nchildhood education and development (ECED); (iv) literacy and lifelong learning; (v) technical \neducation and vocational training; (vi) teacher professional development; and (vii) capacity \ndevelopment;  management  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Social  inclusion  policies  and \nstrategies to ensure that vulnerable communities are reached are included in several of these \ncomponents. Priority interventions, targets and key results are summarized in the outline gender \nand vulnerable communities action plan in Table A10. \n4.  Basic education and secondary education. SSR emphasizes the need to improve \naccess to education for girls and disadvantaged groups. A key policy to minimize the threshold \nof access to education is the provision of free basic education, including cost-free services for \nadmission,  textbooks,  tuition,  and  examinations.  The  policy  intent  under  SSR  is  to  make \nsecondary  education  gradually  free2 by  2015.  To  address  financial  constraints  for  poor, \nmarginalized,  and  needy  children,  scholarships  and  other  support  are  provided  for  Dalits, \nmarginalized  groups,  disabled,  girls,  and  children  from  poor  households.  SSR  envisions \nproviding 13.5 million scholarships over 2010\u20132014 ranging from NRs350 for basic education to \nNRs1,700 for secondary education. A total budget of $72 million has been allocated for this \npurpose. Girls\u2019 scholarships will target 6.6 million scholarships for an amount of $29 million in \nbasic education, and 0.7 million scholarships for girls in secondary education, amounting to \n$14 million. Free alternative programs will be provided for students who cannot attend formal \n                                                 \n1  Vulnerable  groups  are  defined  as  Dalits,  girl  children,  ethnic  minorities,  linguistic  minorities,  children  from \nindigenous groups, children with disabilities, working children, street children, conflict-affected children, calamity-\naffected children, children from remote regions, poor children, children with parents in prison, children rescued from \ntrafficking, and children of migrant parents. \n2  Free secondary education will include at least free services of admission and tuition fees. Textbooks and curricular \nmaterials will be made available at a subsidized rate. \n ", "72  Appendix 10 \nschools. Special provisions will be made to cater to the needs of public school students in \nKarnali Zone, one of the poorest areas in the country. These include the provision of free \neducation up to grade 10, and additional school feeding programs. SSR also provides for the \nrecognition and support of caste and cultural education sources like Gumbas, Vihar, Madarsas, \nand  Gurukul,  which  will  contribute  to  the  education  of  children  not  attending  mainstream \neducation  institutions.  Norms  and  guidelines  that  define  the  various  types  of  formal  and \nnonformal  basic  education  services  have  been  developed.  Access  will  also  be  enhanced \nthrough  expansion  of  physical  facilities,  including  construction  of  19,500  classrooms; \nrehabilitation of 13,000 schools; construction of 300 libraries and laboratories; construction and \ntransformation of 100 schools for children with special needs; and upgrading of the external \nenvironment (including separate toilets for girls and boys) of 7,000 schools.   \n5.  Early childhood education and development. To increase children\u2019s access to and \nparticipation in ECED programs, emphasis will be placed on expanding ECED services in \ndisadvantaged  and  underserved  areas.  Locations  of  disadvantaged  populations\u2014including \nethnic minorities, women, Madhesis, endangered groups, and Dalits\u2014will be identified and they \nwill be given priority to ensure their access to the ECED program. Funding arrangements will be \nadjusted to the needs and financial capacity of communities.  \n6.  Literacy  and  lifelong  learning. The SSR plan intends to augment the neo-literacy \nprogram as a complementary intervention to the National Literacy Campaign, aimed at attaining \nthe EFA goal and MDGs on Universal Primary Education and literacy, with special emphasis on \ntargeted groups and areas\u2014including women, marginalized populations, Dalits, endangered \ncommunities, internally displaced people, people with disability, and people living with HIV/AIDS. \nIncome-generation programs targeting women, Dalits, ethnic minorities, and other marginalized \ngroups will be introduced along with neo-literacy and lifelong learning programs through an \nintegrated approach. \n7.  Teacher  professional  development.  Affirmative  action  to  increase  the  number  of \nteachers  from  disadvantaged  groups  include  the  equitable  allocation  of  positions,  while \nrecruiting teachers and personnel in management positions from these groups, criteria for \nteacher  selection  weighted  in  favor  of  candidates  from  these  groups,  and  mandatory \nrequirements for gender-separated toilets in schools. To increase female participation further, \nspecial  provisions  for  females  for  entry  into  the  teaching  profession  will  be  made.  These \nprovisions  include  promotion  criteria  weighted  in  favor  of  qualified  female,  Dalit,  and \ndisadvantaged teachers; and provisions for maternity and paternity leave, infant feeding breaks, \nand provision for substitute teachers. \n8.  Monitoring and evaluation. Monitoring of progress will be regularly conducted by the \nGovernment and development partners, as part of the regular program review process. A broad \nset  of  indicators  is  tracked  by  the  Government  through  the  biannual  Flash  reports.  Key \nindicators related to social inclusion have been included in the program design and monitoring \nframework.  Progress  will  be  monitored  through  the  collection  and  analysis  of  gender-\ndisaggregated data as appropriate. Policy provisions related to the introduction of free education, \nprovisions for alternative schooling, and the allocation of teacher positions to female teachers \nand  teachers  from  disadvantaged  social  groups  have  been  included  as  tranche  release \nconditions. The SSR program will be evaluated at midterm and at the end of the program. \n \n \n ", " \nTable A10: Outline Gender and Vulnerable Communities Action Plan \nPriority Interventions  Targets and Key Results  Implementing Agencies \nBasic Education and Secondary Education \n1.
