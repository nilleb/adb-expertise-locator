The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  broad-based  assistance  to  the \nGovernment of Nepal for the education sector, covering primary and secondary education, and \nvocational training. An Education Sector Program (ESP) cluster was approved in December \n2006, together with its first subprogram (ESP I),1 with the aim of supporting the Government\u2019s \nreform of the school system in a phased manner. The second subprogram (ESP II) is being \nconsidered for approval in 2007. The third subprogram (ESP III) is included in the Nepal country \noperations business plan (2008\u20132010) as a firm grant in 2009. The Government has requested \nADB for a program preparatory technical assistance (TA) to prepare the ESP III. The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s 2007 technical assistance program for Nepal.2 The TA Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited Nepal during 10\u201319 September 2007, and reached an understanding on the TA\u2019s impact, \noutcome, methodology, implementation arrangements, costs and financing plan, and consulting \nservices. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The school system of Nepal consists of 5 years of primary education (grades 1\u20135),         \n3  years  of  lower  secondary  education  (grades  6\u20138),  and  2  years  of  secondary  education \n(grades 9\u201310). A school leaving certificate is awarded by a centrally administered national \nexamination at the end of grade 10. Higher secondary education (grades 11\u201312) is administered \nseparately  under  the  Higher  Secondary  Education  Board.  Participation  in  education  has \nimproved considerably over the last five decades, especially at primary level. In 2007, the \nprimary education net enrollment rate reached 87.4%, compared with 81% in 2001. However, \nhigh repetition and drop-out rates and poor learning outcomes, especially among girls and \nsocioeconomically disadvantaged groups are the major concerns. Despite the Government\u2019s \nefforts to meet the increasing demand for education, especially at post-primary level, financing \ngaps, a poorly qualified teaching force, and institutional weaknesses hamper the improvement \nof efficiency and performance of school education.   \n3.  Government commitment to education is high, as reflected in the successive 5-year \nplans3 and the 3-year interim plan (FY2008\u2013FY2010).4 A key national priority is to increase \nequity in access to education, while social inclusion is a central approach to reduce disparities in \neducation in terms of gender, caste, and ethnicity. The decentralization of school management \nresponsibilities to school management committees, and community participation in education, \nare also at the center of the Government\u2019s strategy to improve the quality and efficiency of \neducation. In 2000, Nepal joined the global Education for All (EFA) movement.5 The national \nplan of action for EFA 2015 was drawn up with the vision of achieving quality basic and primary \neducation for all by 2015. To achieve the EFA goals, the Government launched the Nepal EFA \nProgram (2004\u20132009), a high-priority program for basic and primary education supported by \nmore than 11 development partners, including ADB. Similarly, the Secondary Education Support \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

The Government recognizes that 5 years of basic education are not enough to meet \nNepal\u2019s long-term human resources needs and is determined to extend basic education to cover \ngrades 1\u20138. Similarly, it envisages extending secondary education to cover grades 9\u201312. The \nGovernment  also  intends  to  improve  synergies  between  basic  education  and  secondary \neducation to achieve a more holistic approach to school education. For that purpose, the \nGovernment has initiated the preparation of a school sector reform (SSR) program, which aims \nat restructuring the school system into an integrated grade 1\u201312 system in a phased manner. \nThe Government is developing an SSR core document, which will guide the transition from the \ncurrent  subsector  approach  to  education,  financed  by  programs  such  as  EFA  and  the \nSecondary Education Support Program, to an integrated SSR. The core document will guide the \nimplementation of an SSR program expected to start in FY2010. It will serve as a policy and \nplanning  guide  for  gradual  introduction  of  the  grade  1\u201312  integrated  system.  It  will  clarify \nGovernment commitments with respect to the provision, promotion, and appraisal of educational \nservices within the framework of the grade 1\u201312 system. Major strategies relating to standards \nof services and performance such as management, financing, and the legal and regulatory \nframework  will  be  detailed.  The  core  document  will  describe  operational  procedures  for \ndelivering school education of an acceptable quality, in partnership with the community and civil \nsociety.  It  will  contain  details  of  programs,  the  financing  framework,  and  implementation \narrangements. A draft core document was developed and endorsed by the interministerial \neducation  policy  committee  in  September  2007  for  broad  stakeholder  dissemination  and \nconsultation.   \n5.  SSR is viewed as a combination of affirmative actions and policy changes aimed at \nattainment of the EFA goals by 2015. SSR builds on lessons learned from the EFA program and \nattempts to address systemic issues that impede the progress of the education system. As such, \nSSR envisions a sector reform that emphasizes the quality and relevance of education, and a \nschool system that is needs-based, flexible, and accountable. It intends to provide multiple \neducational choices to schools and communities with regard to learning content, medium of \ninstruction, learning materials, and delivery methods. It envisions a contractual model between \ncentral  and  local  government  bodies  and  the  schools  wherein  government  bodies  will  be \nresponsible  for  providing  minimum  enabling  conditions  for  learning  in  exchange  for  which \nschools will be responsible for achieving an agreed-upon quality standard for service delivery \nand  learning  achievements.  The  backbone  of  such  a  system  is  the  establishment  of  an \nobligatory framework, a set of norms and standards, and an accountability mechanism that will \ndefine the roles, functions, and level of responsibilities at each institutional level. Furthermore, \nadvanced policy and strategy options to further enhance social inclusion and affirmative actions \nto  support  education  for  girls  and  disadvantaged  groups  have  been  defined  in  the  core \ndocument.  \n6.  The draft core document contains a well articulated and clear vision for SSR. It provides \na solid basis for further elaboration of the reform process. The challenge is to build consensus \namong the various stakeholders and deepen analysis on how to achieve SSR goals in a realistic \nand sustainable manner. Prioritization among the many areas of suggested policy reforms, \nadjustment and streamlining of the multiple strategic options, and policy decisions on phased \nand focused reform planning and process will be the major tasks, as will be securing adequate \nfinancial resources. A thorough analysis of the cost implications and benefits of the various \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "  3\npolicy options will need to be undertaken. Further in-depth analysis of the institutional, technical, \nand financial implications of the suggested policy and strategic options is also needed. This will \nhelp to further refine the rationale of the preferred options and to plan the phased reform and \nrestructuring process. \n7.  The ESP cluster is designed to support SSR in a phased manner. The ESP I supports \nthe ongoing EFA program. A capacity-development grant7 complements the ESP I to develop \ngovernment  stakeholders\u2019  capacity  in  policy  analysis,  formulation  and  coordination  in \npreparation  for  SSR.  Progress  under  the  ESP  I  is  positive,  as  EFA  shows  improvement, \nincluding in the participation of girls, the number of trained teachers, and the grade 5 survival \nrate.8 The ESP II intends to support the preparation of, and transition to, SSR, in particular a \nmodel-building exercise of the basic education extension to grades 1\u20138 in a few districts. The \nESP  III  as  subprogram  III  intends  to  support  implementation  of  the  SSR  once  the  core \ndocument is finalized and financed and the legal, governance, and financing framework is \nadjusted to the grade 1\u201312 school system. It is expected that the SSR policy, program, and \nfinancing  framework  will  be  broadly  accepted  and  adequately  financed  by  FY2010.  The \nGovernment  has  requested  participation  of  all  education  development  partners  in  the \npreparation of SSR, and in the financing of the SSR program. Joint preparation for the SSR \nprogram includes a round of consultation meetings to be held in 2008, followed by one or more \njoint appraisal missions by all development partners in 2008 and 2009.  \n8.  The SSR program is expected to follow a similar program-based approach adopted \nunder  EFA.  EFA  is  Nepal\u2019s  first  truly  program-based  approach  under  which  development \npartners in education pool funds and use country systems and fully harmonized procedures for \ntheir contributions. Core financing of EFA is through a joint financing arrangement (JFA) under \nwhich development partners9 provide allocated budget support to EFA. Program activities and \nbudget items are mutually agreed upon by EFA partners before the beginning of each fiscal \nyear, through a review of an annual rolling plan, the annual strategic implementation plan, and \nthe annual work plan and budget. The annual commitments of development partners are based \non outcome and process performance indicators. It is expected that the existing JFA will be \nreassessed and adjusted under the SSR.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be that the envisioned restructured grade 1\u201312 school system \nis successfully implemented in a phased manner throughout all districts. The outcome of the TA \nwill be an ESP III program design10 to support the implementation of the grade 1\u201312 school \nsystem.  The  program  design  will  reflect  the  readiness  of  the  Government  to  initiate \nimplementation  of  the  reform  and  broad  consensus  among  stakeholders,  including  the \neducation development partners.  \n                                                 \n7  Footnote 1 (Grant 0065 approved 1 December 2006, amounting to $2 million). \n8  Details of progress under the ESP I are described in the ESP II.    \n9  As of FY2007, Joint financing arrangement (JFA) partners are ADB, Denmark, Finland, Norway, the United \nKingdom, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank. The European Commission intends \nto join JFA from FY2008. The non-JFA partners who provide parallel financing to EFA are the Japan International \nCooperation Agency (JICA), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and \nthe World Food Programme.  \n10Instead  of  ESP  III  as  one  subprogram,  an  ensuing  program  cluster  in  support  of  school  sector  reform \n \nimplementation in a phased manner may be considered. \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA has two objectives: (i) it will assist the SSR core document writing team in \nrefining policy options and strategies and in developing programs and financing frameworks for \nSSR, and (ii) it will help design the ESP III (or a new program cluster) to contribute to the \nfinancing of the SSR program jointly with the other education development partners. \n11.  The first phase of the TA will help the SSR core document writing team in undertaking \nfurther  in-depth  analysis  of  the  institutional,  technical,  financial,  and  human  resources \nrequirements and implications of the SSR. This will include a cost-effectiveness analysis of the \nvarious policy and strategy options in key areas such as (i) school restructuring, (ii) governance \nand  management,  (iii)  quality  improvement  and  assurance,  (iv)  education  financing,  (v) \nvocational training, (vi) alternative education, and (vii) social inclusion. The analysis will help the \nMinistry of Education and Sports (MOES) to (i) prioritize policy options, (ii) refine the rationale of \nthe preferred options, (iii) plan a phased reform and restructuring process, and (iv) prepare a \ncomprehensive  sector  financing  plan.  Such  analysis  will  be  undertaken  based  on  (i)  a \nmacroeconomic projection of the medium-term public expenditure in education, (ii) expected \nexternal  resources,  and  (iii)  consideration  of  policy  options  for  cost  sharing.  A  TA  team \nconsisting of education, macroeconomic, resettlement, gender and social development experts \nwill design and facilitate a series of working sessions, seminars, and workshops for various \nstakeholders, including core document thematic groups, senior officials of MOES, the Ministry of \nFinance, the Department of Education (DOE), and the National Planning Commission, and \nlocal-level stakeholders, especially in the SSR model-building districts. The draft core document \nwill also benefit from international peer review. The core document will be presented at a \nregional or interregional conference on education, or alternatively, peer reviews with policy \nmakers in Asia will be organized. The peer review will expose the core document to regional or \ninternational good practices. The feedback provided will result in an enhanced core document.  \n12.  The second phase of the TA will design the ESP III (or a new program cluster) in close \npartnership  with  MOES  and  DOE  and  education  development  partners.  It  will  assess  the \nreadiness of the revised core document with regard to the technical, social, financial, and \ninstitutional aspects. It will participate in the design of the SSR program led by MOES and DOE \njointly with other partners. It will recommend measures to ensure compliance with ADB social \nsafeguards (the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2) and fiduciary requirements. \nThe expected output is a TA draft final report that will serve as a basis for ADB to participate in \nthe joint SSR appraisal missions.   \n13.  The TA will be implemented in full harmonization with initiatives undertaken by other \ndevelopment partners. Under MOES and DOE leadership and coordination, the TA team will \nplan and coordinate work with technical expertise provided by technical assistance from other \ndevelopment partners. A full-time program planning and coordination specialist as TA deputy \nteam leader will ensure liaison and coordination with both the Government and development \npartners. He or she will participate in all meetings, keep abreast of Government and partners\u2019 \ninitiatives in education, and ensure full coordination of TA activities and the timing of TA inputs \nand outputs with the joint SSR appraisal process.  \n14.  The TA will also work closely with the capacity-development grant under the ESP I. \nParticularly, the TA team will ensure that international consultants work closely with the national \n ", "  5\nconsultants  under  the  capacity-development  grant.    Furthermore,  the  TA  team  will  closely \nharmonize with capacity-development activities supported by other development partners.11      \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n15.  The TA is expected to cost $710,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $600,000, financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. ADB will finance \nnational and international consulting services, production of reports, equipment, workshops, \nstudies,  field  surveys,  international  peer  reviews,  and  administrative  support  services. \nGovernment support to the TA, estimated at $110,000 equivalent, will be in kind, and will \ninclude the provision of counterpart staff, office accommodation and space for meetings, and \ngeneral office support. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing program. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 3.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  A team of four international consultants and two national consultants will be recruited to \nprovide  specialist  services  totaling  27  person-months  (international  12  person-months,  and \nnational 15 person-months). A pool of international consultant inputs of approximately 4 person-\nmonths will be retained. This may include a legal expert, teacher management specialist, or \nother  needs  as  determined  in  consideration  of  expertise  provided  by  other  development \npartners. ADB will engage all consultants on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. Office equipment needed to implement the TA \nwill be procured by the consultants according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time) and will be turned over to MOES upon TA completion. International \npeer reviews, seminars and workshops will be organized by the consultants. \n17.  MOES will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The steering committee under the \ncapacity-development  grant  will  oversee  the  TA  implementation.  To  maximize  Government \nleadership and minimize the strain on MOES, the TA work will be carefully scheduled. MOES \nhas assured that counterpart staff will be available to work with the TA team and has agreed to \nprovide the following support to the TA team: (i) administrative and logistic support; (ii) office \naccommodation,  supplies,  and  facilities;  and  (iii)  data  and  reports  as  required.  The  TA \nconsultants will report to the joint secretary of the planning division of MOES and to ADB. \n18.  The TA will begin in February 2008 and end in July 2009. An inception report will be \nsubmitted at the end of the first month after mobilization of the TA team leader. A draft of the \nanalysis of the SSR core document and recommendations for further refinement of the core \ndocument will be submitted as an interim report at the end of the first 3 months. A draft final \nreport will be submitted to ADB and MOES at the end of the 6 months, or at least 2 months \nbefore the first joint appraisal mission. A final report incorporating comments from concerned \nparties will be submitted by the TA completion date.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for preparing the Education Sector Program (Subprogram III), and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n11 JICA  is  developing  a  new  project  on  capacity  development  in  school-based  management.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nEducation plays a vital role in human development and hence contributes to poverty reduction. In Nepal, education \nis considered a major means for poor households to escape from poverty. With external assistance, Nepal has \nmade significant efforts in the education sector, and this has contributed to improvements in human development \nindicators. The Government\u2019s commitment to the Millennium Development Goals has also stimulated more effort in \nimproving the primary education sector with the goal of achieving basic and primary education for all by 2015. \nParticipation in education has improved considerably over the last five decades, especially at primary level. In \n2007, the primary net enrollment rate reached 87.4%, compared with 81% in 2001. However, high repetition and \ndrop-out rates and poor learning outcomes, especially among girls and the socioeconomically disadvantaged \ngroups (including indigenous and ethnic minority groups), are major concerns.  \n \nThe Interim Constitution of 2006 provides the right to free education for each citizen up to secondary level. The \nconstitution also establishes equity measures with the right to receive basic education in mother language. The 3-\nyear interim plan approach paper (2007)1 further emphasizes inclusive education and the right to education for \nwomen, disadvantaged groups, indigenous ethnic groups (janajati), and disabled groups, by increasing their access \nfrom primary to higher education. The 10th 5-Year Plan (2002\u20132007) also identified social development, including \nimprovement in education, as one of the four pillars of Nepal\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and aimed at improving \naccess to, and quality of, education. In line with the Government\u2019s strategy, the program will support Government \nefforts in poverty reduction. It will directly support progress towards Nepal\u2019s Millennium Development Goal targets \nin education. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, \nM2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification: The Program will support the Government\u2019s commitment to \nachieve Millennium Development Goals for education.    \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \nAccording to the Nepal Living Standard Survey II,2 poverty incidence in Nepal is 31%, which is a significant drop \nfrom the 42% recorded by the Nepal Living Standard Survey I.3 Despite this drop, there is still a wide gap within \nsocial groups and regions. The poverty incidence of certain social groups has decreased to relatively low levels. \nFor the Brahmin and Chhetri group, it dropped from 34% in FY1996 to 19% in FY2004, while for Newars it has \nreduced from 19% to 14% in the same period. However, the poverty incidence among dalits, indigenous ethnic \ngroups (janajatis), and Muslims remains higher than the national average. The poverty incidence of dalits was 47% \nin FY2004, down from 59% in FY1996. Poverty is more severe among tarai dalits than among hill dalits. Among hill \njanajatis, the poverty rate is 44% in FY2004, down from 49% in FY1996, and for tarai janajatis it is 36%, which is \ndown from 53% in FY1996.

How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? The Program supports the Government\u2019s social inclusion policy in education. Therefore, girls and \nchildren from socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, including indigenous and ethnic minority groups, will benefit \nfrom the Program.  \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? Programs that specifically \naddress the economical, cultural, and social constraints in education of the most vulnerable groups need to be \nincluded. Incentive-based approaches are needed for the socioeconomically disadvantaged caste and ethnic \ngroups, including the most vulnerable groups. \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? Weak institutional capacity  in education services, including low sensitivity towards issues of \nexclusion, can constrain access to program benefits by vulnerable groups. Effective monitoring and sensitization of \nimplementing agencies on social inclusion will contribute to addressing the constraints.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate  the  potential  initial  stakeholders:  Potential  initial  stakeholders  include  concerned  government \nagencies, local bodies, political parties, civil societies including the associations representing indigenous groups \n(janajati) and dalits, teacher unions, parent associations, and school management committees. \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, etc.)? During the PPTA, several workshops, seminars and/or consultations will be conducted with a \nwide range of stakeholders. The TA will follow a participatory approach\u2014the key to building consensus in strategy \ndevelopment.   \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?        Yes          No    Please explain.  \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nGender-based disparities in education are still prevalent in Nepal. The literacy rate of Nepali women is 42%, \ncompared to 65% for men. Girls in rural areas do not have equal access to primary education. The gap widens even \nmore in secondary levels and higher education. Grade 5 completion rates are lower for girls than boys in most \ndistricts. Girls are more prone to drop out due to sociocultural reasons and the unfavorable school environment. The \nliteracy and educational level of girls and women differs widely across regions and social groups, and in urban and \nrural areas. \n \nThe program aims not only to address gender inequality in education but also to advise policy for social inclusion \nthrough affirmative actions. The vulnerable community development framework will be a tool for addressing gender \nand caste and/or ethnic exclusion in the education sector. Gender inequality issues are central in the framework. It \nwill be applied to facilitate equity measures in implementation and monitoring of the progress of gender and social \ninclusion actions. The gender and social inclusion plan will be developed based on the vulnerable community \ndevelopment framework with specific targeted activities. \n \n2. Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment \nby improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?   \n Yes      No  Please explain.  \n \n3.  Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality? \n Yes      No  Please explain : the Program will have a positive impact on girls and women.   \n \n \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \nIII.
