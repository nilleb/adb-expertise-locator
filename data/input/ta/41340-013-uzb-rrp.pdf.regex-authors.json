I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Advanced Electricity Metering Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will install an advanced electricity metering (AEM) system that uses modern, \naccurate, and theft-proof revenue meters for 1 million residential and commercial customers in \nBukhara, Jizzakh and Samarkand regions. AEM will allow accounting for every unit of power \nconsumed, which is essential to minimize commercial losses and identify upgrades that will \nlower technical losses. The project will help improve energy efficiency, reduce commercial \nlosses, and improve the efficiency of electricity revenue collection.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The economy has sustained high growth, averaging 8.5% since 2006. Growth in 2011 \nand  beyond  is  expected  to  remain  at  8%\u20139%.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  prioritizes \nmodernizing  industry  and  developing  infrastructure  and  the  private  sector.  Reliable  and \naffordable electricity supply is vital to achieving these goals. \n \n4.  The country is one of the most energy-intensive in the world, with one of the highest \nelectricity consumption rates.3 High energy intensity and electricity consumption relative to the \nsize of economy mean that even a slight improvement in energy efficiency could have a great \neconomic impact. Promoting energy efficiency is a strategic priority for Uzbekistan and the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB),4 as it is the least-cost low-carbon solution to sustaining energy \nsecurity. Energy efficiency eases high energy intensity and improves energy productivity. \n \n5.  The efficient use of electricity can be promoted by accounting for every unit of power \nconsumed. Minimizing commercial losses and identifying upgrades that will lower technical \nlosses will help improve energy efficiency. Uzbekistan suffers high transmission and distribution \nlosses. The state joint stock company Uzbekenergo, a vertically integrated utility fully owned by \nthe government, estimates total system losses of up to nearly 20%: 2%\u20134% in transmission and \n13%\u201315% in distribution. This is nearly four times the 5% losses experienced in advanced \ncountries, and actual losses are thought to be higher, with commercial losses in the range of \n25%\u201335%. As total annual power supply in Uzbekistan is 51,935 gigawatt-hours, reducing \nlosses by 1% would annually save 520 gigawatt-hours, worth $26 million. \n \n6.  Uzbekistan\u2019s electrification rate is almost 100%. All connections are metered and billed \naccording to tariffs set for consumer categories. But the electricity meters\u2014electromechanical \ndevices that were manufactured during 1960\u20131990\u2014are generally old and unreliable. They are \nstill in service  well beyond their  designed economic life without recalibration for accuracy, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Republic of \nUzbekistan for the Advanced Electricity Metering Project. Manila (TA7740-UZB, for $1.0 million, approved on 17 \nDecember). \n3  In 2008, Uzbekistan was the second most energy-intensive country in the world, when measured by total primary \nenergy supply per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) (tons of oil equivalent per unit of GDP at purchasing power \nparity, measured in constant 2000 US dollars). It has the ninth-highest electricity consumption in the world, when \nmeasured by electricity consumption per unit of GDP (kilowatt-hour per unit of GDP, measured in constant 2000 \nUS dollars). (International Energy Agency. 2010. Energy Balances of Non-OECD Countries. Paris.) \n4  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. ", "2 \nmaking it difficult for Uzbekenergo to account for electricity use. They are also easy to tamper \nwith. \n \n7.  A shortage of meter-reading personnel means that not all meters are regularly read. \nCustomers read their meters themselves but sometimes underreport their consumption. Meter \nreaders (or controllers) are often unable to read the meters and collect revenue, as most meters \nare  installed  inside  the  house.  Controllers  can  decide  to  either  disconnect  the  customers \nimmediately for past unpaid consumption or overlook the excess consumption and enter into the \nsystem a reading lower than the actual one. \n \n8.  AEM, or \u201csmart metering\u201d with digital meters, allows two-way communication between \nthe utility and consumers. AEM enables the utility to remotely monitor and disconnect supply \nwithout  sending  reading  personnel  to  the  site.  It  provides  consumers  with  power  usage \ninformation more frequently. AEM can help identify losses, reduce commercial losses, and \nimprove  tariff  collection.  The  AEM  system  will  accommodate  both  pre-  and  post-payment. \nUzbekenergo  expects  to  use  AEM  technology  to  increase  energy  efficiency  through  loss \nreduction and, potentially, demand-side management.5 \n \n9.  With an internal budget of $32 million, Uzbekenergo is installing bulk revenue meters \ncapable of accurately measuring and reporting interval demand for large, high- and medium-\nvoltage industrial customers and transmission\u2013distribution interfaces. This is to be completed by \nthe end of 2014. The installation of an AEM system that encompasses low-voltage residential \nand small commercial customers is a step toward ensuring the accurate measurement of losses \nin various system components, allowing loss reduction efforts to focus on feeders with the \nhighest losses. \n \n10.  Uzbekenergo has undertaken several pilot automated and advanced metering projects \nin  Tashkent,  covering  53,000  consumers.  The  pilot  schemes  have  generally  reduced \ncommercial  and  collection  losses,  substantially  increasing  revenue. 6  AEM\u2019s  two-way \ncommunication feature allowed remote connection and disconnection and prevents theft and \nbypassing  the  meter.  However,  integration  was  difficult  because  of  the  differing  and \nincompatible technologies used. Building on the experience of the pilot projects in Tashkent, \nUzbekenergo and the government plan to integrate the AEM system and expand it to all 4.5 \nmillion customers in phases. After covering the first 1 million customers with ADB assistance, \nthe same system will be replicated in other regions.7 \n \n11.  The project follows ADB\u2019s strategy for Uzbekistan, which includes a focus on energy \nefficiency and reliable power supply.8 It will be ADB's second intervention in Uzbekistan's power \nsector. \n \n                                                \n5  AEM technology enables the utility to manage load with tariffs differentiated by time of day. The power usage \ninformation that consumers will have access to, and the utility\u2019s ability to remotely control the power supply, can be \nused to encourage consumers to conserve energy and pay on time. \n6  The revenue increase attributable to the pilot projects was 80% of the base revenue in 2005 (World Bank. Smart \nMetering, Communication, and Data Management System of Uzbekenergo. Unpublished. \n7  The government has requested the World Bank to finance the investment cost for AEM system development in \nTashkent City, Tashkent Region, and Sirdaria, which together comprise 1.5 million customers. \n8  ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Uzbekistan, 2011\u20132013. Manila. \n ", "3 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the project will be a power sector that is more financially viable. AEM will \nhelp improve energy efficiency and ensure that the energy used is properly accounted for and \nbilled. The project outcome will be substantially reduced commercial and tariff collection losses \nfor residential and small business entity customers. The project will target distribution systems in \nBukhara, Jizzakh and Samarkand. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The  project  will  install  advanced  electricity  meters  in  1  million  residences  and \ncommercial entities. It will enable Uzbekenergo to monitor the energy balance. The billing \nsystem will be automated to improve accuracy and efficiency. The project will improve metering \naccuracy, anti-tampering and fault-detection capability, billing efficiency, and the tariff collection \nrate. \n \n14.  The  project  will  improve  the  quality  of  customer  service.  With  better  access  to \ninformation on their power usage and energy efficiency, customers will be able to make better \ndecisions on electricity use. In households, women are the main users of electricity but do not \nnecessarily make spending decisions. The project will give them more household decision-\nmaking power, as well as train them for jobs at regional data-management centers and district \nservice centers. \n \n1.  Physical Outputs \n15.  Advanced  electricity  metering  system  development. The system requires (i) the \ninstallation of 1 million meters and an associated data communication system, including single-\nphase  retail  AEM  meters  for  residential  and  small  commercial  customers,  16,000  data \nconcentrators  for  retail  meters  and  bulk  three-phase  meters  to  obtain  balance  (one  per \ntransformer),  and  cable  products  and  (ii)  the  programming  and  installation  of  meter  data-\nmanagement (MDM) and billing systems, including computers, printers, servers, and software \nfor three regional data-management centers and 45 district service centers. \n \n2.  Nonphysical Outputs \n16.  Training Uzbekenergo personnel. Skills training will be given to (i) staff that will install \nmeters  and  create  the  customer  database,  (ii)  operation  and  maintenance  personnel  and \nmanagement  at  regional  data-management  and  district  service  centers,  and  (iii)  meter \ncontrollers who will be transferred to other sections. Special attention will be given to women \nemployees. Contractors and a supervision and project management consultant will train staff \nand transfer knowledge. \n \n17.  Public information program. The program will disseminate information on electricity \nservices, payment, and energy conservation through media and other means, with special \nattention paid to household gender roles. The program will also improve the complaint-redress \nmechanism and emergency hotline. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n18.

The government  has requested  a  loan  of $150  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The \ngovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The ADB loan proceeds will be relent from the borrower to \nUzbekenergo with the same terms and at the same annual interest rate as the ADB loan \npursuant  to  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement.  Foreign  exchange  risk  will  be  assumed  by \nUzbekenergo. \n \n20.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The government will arrange counterpart financing, in \npart to cover taxes and duties amounting to $32.1 million. Uzbekenergo\u2019s internal resources will \ncover the balance of the project cost, including installing meters and creating the billing system \ndatabase, training controllers assigned to other sections, and implementing the gender action \nplan and public information program. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  150.0    75.0 \nGovernment and Uzbekenergo  50.0    25.0 \n  Total    200.0    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "5 \nE.

The supplier will install the meter data-management and billing systems and provide training and trouble-\nshooting during implementation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n22.  A  dedicated  full-time  project  management  unit  (PMU)  has  been  established  in \nUzbekenergo  and  staffed  with  qualified  and  experienced  personnel.  The  PMU,  funded  by \nUzbekenergo\u2019s internal sources, will administer all consulting and procurement contracts on \nbehalf of Uzbekenergo. It will be responsible for preparing project plans, bid evaluation reports, \nprogress reports, applications for withdrawal of funds, and any other reports required by ADB. \n \n23.  Uzbekenergo will employ a single contractor to (i) procure the MDM and billing systems \nfor the regional offices and district service centers and (ii) the advanced electricity meters and \nassociated communication system using ADB's single-stage, two-envelope bidding procedure. \nThe contractor will provide related services to Uzbekenergo such as training, trouble-shooting, \nand the customization and installation of the MDM and billing systems. \n \n24.  ADB will rigorously assess the project\u2019s social and economic impacts on households, \nfocusing on gender impacts.10 Uzbekenergo will facilitate the impact evaluation study. \n                                                \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n25.  ADB conducted technical due diligence on the proposed investments and is satisfied \nwith the rationale, technical specifications, quantities, and cost estimates. The AEM system will \nmake billing transparent, improve operational efficiency, and build the strategic infrastructure for \nfuture load management in the three project regions. \n \n26.  The project will consist of two components to allow full AEM system functionality: (i) \nmeters and an associated communication system and (ii) the MDM and billing systems. The \nproject  will  replace  over  1  million  conventional  electromechanical  electricity  meters  with \nadvanced,  highly  accurate  solid-state  electricity  meters.  Manipulation  will  be  minimized  by \ninstalling all meters outside of customer premises, in publicly accessible and visible areas, and \nin weather-proof and tamper-proof cabinets. A three-phase bulk meter will be installed at each \ntransformer to allow electricity balancing. The meter data will be transmitted to the MDM and \nbilling  systems,  eliminating  the  commercial  losses  caused  by  frequent  human  errors  and \ninaccurate measurements. Secure two-way communication links will be installed between all \nmeters, regional centers, and district service centers through existing power line carriers and/or \ncommunication  infrastructure,  to  enable  frequent  monitoring  of  meter  reading  and  better \nmanagement control. \n \n27.  Regional offices will be equipped with separate MDM and billing systems and provide \nsystem  operation  and  management  oversight.  The  MDM  system  will  be  customized  to \noperational needs and improve the efficiency of management and operational processes. Each \nregional office will be able to perform MDM functions, including regional load balancing, financial \naudit and planning, service quality monitoring, and asset management, as well as adopt a real-\ntime tariff structure. The system will be able to integrate large-scale customers connected with 6 \nkilovolts (kV), 10 kV, and 35 kV supply lines into the system. \n \n28.  Forty-five existing district service centers in Bukhara, Jizzakh and Samarkand will be \nprovided with billing hardware and software and linked to the regional MDM centers through a \ncommunication system. The service centers will extract information from the regional MDM \nsystem. The AEM system will enable service centers to (i) improve operation efficiency in their \ntraditional functions such as billing and customer management and relations, (ii) balance load at \nthe district or transformer level to reduce commercial losses, (iii) improve system stability by \nlimiting the load that can be drawn during supply shortages or other emergencies, and (iv) \nremotely connect and disconnect customers. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n29.  The project\u2019s economic viability is assessed based on streams of benefits and costs \nresulting from installation and operation over the project\u2019s life. By eliminating distribution losses \ncaused, for example, by bypassing meters, the project may reduce consumption by those who \nare not paying properly. But the benefits of additional consumption resulting from reduced \noutages and efficient electricity distribution will be significant. The economic internal rate of \n                                                                                                                                                       \n10 This impact evaluation study is expected to be financed through separate technical assistance to be processed and \nimplemented beginning in early 2012. \n ", "7 \nreturn is 18.0%, which compares favorably with the 12.0% opportunity cost of capital and \njustifies investment in the project. \n \n30.  The project\u2019s financial internal rate of return is 8.0%, which compares favorably with the \nestimated weighted average cost of capital of 1.8%, indicating that the project is financially \nviable. Financial viability was gauged by comparing the revenue and cost streams of scenarios \nwith and without the project. The revenue stream from residential and commercial customers is \nexpected to increase by 70%. \n \n31.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s financial performance has been strong since 2006. The company has \nbecome highly profitable, with a low debt\u2013equity ratio, helped by the accelerated depreciation of \nfixed assets. Most of the fixed assets are inherited as equity, not as debt, and their residual \nvalue appears to have already depreciated. \n \n32.  The  projected  financial  sustainability  for  2011\u20132015  incorporates  Uzbekenergo's \ninvestment plan to expand its power facilities. The total investment, including this project, will \nrequire funding of over $3 billion. The financial plan, with a good mix of debt and Uzbekenergo's \ninternal sources, can be implemented without putting undue stress on Uzbekenergo\u2019s future \nfinances and creditworthiness. But the tariff should be adjusted to reflect the cost of services \nand inflation. \n \n33.  Uzbekistan\u2019s challenge is how to manage the cost of new finance required to replace \naging  power  infrastructure, most  of  which  continues  in  use  beyond  its  economic  life. The \ngovernment is committed to maintaining the cost of service tariffs for electricity. Since 2004, the \nnominal tariff for electricity has increased by 18%\u201320% per year. As a result, the retail tariff per \nkilowatt-hour (kWh) has since 2004 more than quadrupled, from SUM20/kWh to SUM84/kWh. \nContinued tariff increases above the 10% rate of inflation has allowed the power utility to \nachieve a sustainable financial performance without direct subsidy. \n \nC.  Governance \n34.  The  government  has  undertaken  a  series  of  measures  to  strengthen  its  national \ngovernance, including (i) legal reforms to improve the judiciary and courts; (ii) reforms to public \nsector  management,  especially  public  financial  management  and  tax  reforms;                          \n(iii) demonopolization measures to make the private sector more competitive; and (iv) more \ntransparent procurement procedures. Progress has been made in public financial management, \nincluding the adoption of the Budget System Law and Treasury Law approved in 2007 and the \npublic expenditure reform process covering 2007\u20132018. Uzbekistan acceded to the United \nNations Convention against Corruption in July 2008. A comprehensive governance assessment \nis being conducted as part of ADB's new country partnership strategy now under preparation. \n \n35.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  Uzbekenergo  found  that  it  has  a  basic \nfinancial and accounting policy that adopts accrual accounting, double-entry bookkeeping, and \nother generally accepted accounting principles and conventions in compliance with national \nstandards. Capacity development under the ongoing Talimarjan Power Project will strengthen \nUzbekenergo's financial management capacity and accounting and auditing practices.11 \n \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2010.

It has limited \nexperience working with ADB.12 Smooth project implementation requires (i) that the PMU have \ndirect access to Uzbekenergo management for efficient decision making, (ii) the staffing of PMU \nwith  competent specialists  and translators,  and  (iii)  an  international  consultant  to  assist  in \nprocurement  and  related  activities.13 Procurement  will  follow  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2010,  as  amended from  time to  time),  including the  use  of standard  bidding  documents. \nUzbekenergo\u2019s key PMU staff members have participated in a procurement workshop.

An  early  warning  system  will  be  established  to  ensure timely \nprocurement and project implementation. \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and Uzbekenergo. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 9). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n38.  The project will help improve customer services by (i) increasing the staffing of existing \ndistrict service centers, (ii) introducing a 24-hour customer service hotline with emergency \nresponse services for households, (iii) establishing a complaint-redress mechanism, and (iv) \ndeveloping a participatory public information program. \n \n39.  The project will improve fair billing for electricity. It will empower consumers through a \npublic information program, with women as agents of change to promote energy efficiency, \nconsumer rights, and the newly introduced billing system. The project will also improve career \nopportunities and working conditions for women, allowing women meter readers (or controllers) \nto be absorbed into safer job environments and retrained. The project\u2019s gender action plan \nincludes improving project benefits for women and, therefore, gender equality in the energy \nsector.15  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n40.  No major social or environmental safeguards issues are envisaged under the project. \nThe project is category C for all safeguards as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).  ADB  will  monitor  safeguards  issues  during  implementation.  If  any  unanticipated \nenvironmental  or  social  impacts  become  apparent  during  project  implementation,  ADB  will \nadvise  and  require  the  Uzbekenergo  to  (i)  assess  the  significance  of  such  unanticipated \nimpacts; (ii) evaluate the options available to address them; (iii) prepare relevant safeguards \ndocuments; and (iv) take necessary action(s). The project will be implemented and operated in \ncompliance with the government\u2019s rules and regulations governing the project\u2019s environmental \nand social aspects. \n \n                                                \n12 Uzbekenergo has limited experience working with other multilateral and bilateral financiers; this is the second ADB \nproject in Uzbekistan\u2019s energy sector. \n13 These key success factors were the lessons from the Talimarjan Power Project, the first ADB energy project in \nUzbekistan. \n14 ADB. 2010.
