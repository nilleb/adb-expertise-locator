I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the additional financing of the Secondary \nTowns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project. 1  \n \n2.  The proposed additional financing will ensure successful completion of the head works \nof the Muttur water supply scheme. The distribution networks and elevated towers of the Muttur \nscheme are under construction. However, even after supplementary assistance2 for this project \non 29 November 2006, for exogenous reasons, significant price escalation of key inputs has \nresulted  in cost  overruns.  While  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  is prepared  to  increase  its \ncontribution to meet the final cost to completion, it has asked the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide additional financing from loan savings to ease the pressure on government \nfunds. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The government gives high priority to the provision of and access to safe drinking water \nfor its population.3 Under Section III of its 2001 Millennium Development Goals objective, the \ngovernment aims by 2015 to reduce by 50% the proportion of people unable to reach or afford \nsafe  drinking  water. 4 The  additional  financing  will  strengthen  the  government\u2019s  efforts  in \n(i) promoting regionally balanced development, (ii) rehabilitating and reconstructing the conflict-\naffected areas, and (iii) reducing poverty and ensuring equitable development in the conflict-\naffected areas. The additional financing was included in the country operations business plan, \n2010\u20132012.5  \n \n4.  Project implementation is rated satisfactory despite being affected by the conflict. All but \none of the 16 contract packages under the urban component covering the towns of Batticaloa, \nHambantota, Muttur, and Polonnaruwa have been awarded. Nine contracts are ongoing and the \nremaining six contracts have been completed. Most of the ongoing works will be completed in \n2011\u2014except for the salinity barrier in Hambantota, which is expected to be completed in early \n2012 well within the current loan closing date of June 2012. This overall progress is despite 18 \nmonths delay in Batticaloa and Muttur caused by the resurgence of conflict in these areas \nduring 2006\u20132007. In addition, three towns6 out of the four in the project were affected by the \n2004 tsunami. In these towns, the displaced persons were resettled during 2005\u20132006. The \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila (Loan 1993-SRI[SF]). \n2  ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Supplementary \nLoans to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based \nWater Supply and Sanitation Project. Manila (Loan 2275-SRI and Loan 2276-SRI [SF]). \n3  As defined by the World Health Organization, access to safe drinking water is the proportion of people using \nimproved drinking water sources: household connection, public standpipe, borehole, protected dug well, protected \nspring, and rainwater. Safe drinking water is water with microbial, chemical, and physical characteristics that meet \nWorld Health Organization guidelines or national standards on drinking water quality. \n4 United Nations. 2001. Road Map Towards the Implementation of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. New \nYork (The report of the Secretary-General). Currently, the proportion of households with sustainable access to safe \ndrinking water is 84.7% and households\u2019 access to improved sanitation is 93.6%. \n5  ADB. 2009. Country Operations Business Plan: Sri Lanka, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n6  Batticaloa, Muttur, and Hambantota. ", "2 \nworking environment in the Eastern districts improved from mid-2007 and work in most of the \ncontracts resumed slowly after clearing of mines. Since the end of conflict in 2009, the working \nenvironment has improved and most of the work is progressing well. Nearly 81% of the 9,606 \nrural water supply schemes planned are now completed, benefiting over 130,000 people. The \nremaining schemes will be completed in 2011. The cumulative contract awards to date are \n$112.24 million (84.1%) and cumulative disbursements are $85.96 million (64.4%).7 \n \n5.  Cost overruns have been reported in most construction operations in Sri Lanka during \n2005 to 2010 including the water supply and sanitation sector. By the time the initial contracts \nwere due for award in 2005 following detailed design, it became apparent that there was a very \nsignificant cost overrun\u2014estimated at $80.2 million. Factors leading to cost overruns in the \nproject included (i) price increases and revision of estimates as a result of the input price \nincrease in the international market and the impact of 2004 tsunami8 ($48.7 million [60%]), and \n(ii) physical changes during detailed engineering design ($16.5 million [21%]). To meet the \nexpected  cost  overrun,  a  supplementary  assistance  loan  (footnote  2)  for  $60  million  was \napproved in November 2006. The revised project cost was estimated at $175.2 million in 2006. \nADB\u2019s loan amount was increased to $120.3 million equivalent (69%) with funds from the \nSpecial  Funds  resources  and  ordinary  capital  resources,  the  government\u2019s  contribution \nincreased to $51.8 million (30%), while beneficiaries\u2019 contribution remained at $3.1 million (1%). \n \n6.  Although price and physical contingencies were built into the 2006 supplementary loan, \nsignificant price escalation continued through 2007\u20132008. As a result, for all contracts awarded, \nbid prices were well above the revised estimates in 2006. This was despite competition in the \nbidding process, with an average of three bids being received, even in conflict-affected areas. \nFrom 2006 to 2009, the average cost increases for key inputs were cement 20%, metal (granite \nstone) 25%, sand 34%, reinforced steel 58%, polyvinyl chloride pipes 57%, ductile iron pipes \n100%, fuel 23%, and labor 25%. During 2006\u20132009, average inflation was 12.5%, but it peaked \nin 2008 at 22.6%. As a result, the final revised cost is now estimated as $259.5 million.  \n \n7.  The  remaining  contract  to  be  awarded,  and  for  which  additional  financing  is  being \nproposed, is for the Muttur head works and treatment plant which could not be financed as a \nresult of increased costs. In the case of the Muttur subproject, bids for the distribution system \nwere called by mid-2006 while the original bidding for the treatment plant and head works was \nin the technical proposal stage under the two-envelope bidding procedure. The tender for the \ndistribution network was awarded in early 2008 in anticipation of awarding the head works \ntender  by  mid  2008.  However,  due  to  a  poor  response  and  unreasonable  bid  prices,  the \ngovernment and ADB decided to re-tender the head works in mid-2008. \n \n8.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is classified involuntary resettlement category B. \nThe NWSDB prepared a short resettlement plan during initial project appraisal, in accordance \nwith  the  government\u2019s  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy 9  and  ADB\u2019s  applicable \nsafeguard  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  (1995).  All  land  acquisition  is  completed  and \ncompensation paid. The proposed activity under this additional financing is within the original \nscope; the current short resettlement plan is valid and no revision is needed. However, ADB will \ncontinuously monitor for any physical changes during implementation.  \n \n                                                 \n7  Overall Progress and Details of the Loan Utilization (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  The impact of the December 2004 tsunami led to a very significant escalation in construction costs in all sectors in \nSri Lanka. \n9  Ministry of Land Development. 2001. National Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Colombo. \n ", "3 \n9.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  environmental  category  B.  As  part  of  due \ndiligence,  proposed  physical  changes  within  the  original  design  have  been  screened  for \nsafeguard  significance  and  found  to  be  within  the  original  project  categorization.  Initial \nenvironmental  examinations  incorporating  detailed  engineering  design  changes  have  been \nformulated for all the schemes during the reappraisal for the 2006 supplementary loan. The \nproject  is  implementing  identified  mitigation  measures.  The  project  has  renewed  all \nenvironmental clearances from the Central Environmental Authority. Since the Muttur scheme is \nwithin the original scope, the current initial environmental examination is valid and no revision is \nneeded.  Environmental  impacts  have  been  minimized  through  appropriate  design  and  site \nlocation,  and  adequate  mitigation  measures  have  been  proposed  to  prevent  or  minimize \nimpacts resulting from construction and operation. \n \n10.  Indigenous  peoples. The project was classified category C for indigenous peoples \nsafeguards under the original loan. Since the Muttur scheme is within the original scope, the \ncurrent classification is valid and no revision is needed. \n \n11.  The  project  promotes  equal  representation  of  women  in  staffing,  planning,  and \nimplementation of the project. Numerical targets set for the project have been met or exceeded, \nand women\u2019s involvement in project implementation is high. Also, women\u2019s participation in the \nrural component of the project was comprehensive because the gender action plan provisions \nwere implemented effectively. Implementing partner nongovernment organizations established \nnew  community-based  organizations  to  manage  rural  water  supply  schemes.  A  recent \nreview shows that both women and men have equal participation and leadership positions in \nthese  community-based  organizations,  which  manage  the  rural  water  supply  schemes.10 \nPositive  changes  in  gender  relations  and  gender  roles  resulting  from  the  project  include \nwomen\u2019s leadership in the community, their increased involvement in planning and managing \ncommunity infrastructure, and increased engagement with local government on identification of \nand  planning  related  to  community  needs.  Women\u2019s  livelihood-related  activities  improved \nthrough access to revolving loan funds through the project, although the impact was limited as \nthe loans were small.  \n \n12.  The government requested ADB to allocate from portfolio savings (i) SDR8.148 million \n($12.773 million)  to  a  supplementary  loan  to  the  North  East  Community  Restoration  and \nDevelopment  Project  II 11  for  urgent  rehabilitation  works  in  the  Northern  province,  and \n(ii) $13 million12 as additional financing to the Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based \nWater Supply and Sanitation Project for completion of the head works and water treatment plant \nin the Muttur water supply scheme in the Eastern province.13 \n \n13.  The  additional  financing  meets  the  eligibility  criteria  in  ADB\u2019s  additional  financing \npolicy,14 i.e., the project remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound. \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2010.

Additional Financing: Enhancing Development Effectiveness. Manila. \n ", "4 \nThe government accords it high priority and it is consistent with the project\u2019s development \nobjectives as well as the current country partnership strategy.15 The proposed assistance meets \nthe standards for additional financing of a well-performing project. The cost overrun is due to \nexogenous reasons, and the government\u2019s evaluation of the tender for the Muttur head works \nhas been completed and works can be completed within 24 months after the award. ADB may \nprovide additional financing to ensure successful completion of ADB-financed projects in the \nevent of a financing gap or a cost overrun. Other applicable priority conditions are that the \nproject is at an advanced stage of implementation and can be completed within a relatively short \ntime, and has a high degree of project readiness in such areas as design, implementation \ncapacity,  and  safeguards.  The  additional  financing  will  meet  cost  overruns  resulting  from \nspecific input price increases and overall inflation, while the project\u2019s scope remains unchanged.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the project is to improve health conditions in Batticaloa, Hambantota, \nMuttur, and Polonnaruwa by reducing (i) the incidence of waterborne diseases by 50%, (ii) the \ninfant mortality by 20%, and (iii) the time and resources that households spend in acquiring \nwater by 75%. The outcome of the project is to provide pipe-borne safe drinking water to \n946,000 people and safe sanitation16 to 171,500 people in the project areas.   \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The main outputs of the project are to: \n \n(a) undertake urban schemes - construct three new water networks to provide 40,000 \nm3/day in Batticaloa, 8,500 m3/day in Muttur, and 30,500 m3/day in Polonnaruwa, extend \none existing water network to provide 15,000 m3/day in Hambantota, construct 33,000 \nlow-cost latrines, construct Batticaloa Hospital waste treatment plan with capacity to \ntreat 350 m3/day, and provide training and public awareness campaigns;  \n \n(b) develop rural water supply and sanitation - construct rural water schemes to provide \ndrinking  water  (piped,  rainfed,  protected  well)  to  350,000  people  in  Anuradhapura, \nBatticaloa and Polonnaruwa, construct 27,000 low-cost latrines, and deliver training \nprograms;  \n \n(c) support institutional strengthening capacity - deliver a national public awareness and \neducation campaign, implement a corporate strategy to improve NWSDB management, \nimplement a strategy to reduce operation and maintenance cost, implement a financial \nmanagement strategy, implement a strategy to transfer systems with less than 1,000 \nconnections to local authorities, community-based organizations, and the private sector, \nand develop an asset registry for systems with more than 10,000 connections. \n \n16.  The additional financing will be used to fund the head works of the Muttur water supply \nscheme. The head works include water intake, raw water transmission, and 8,500 m3/day water \ntreatment plant. If the head works of the Muttur water supply are not completed, it will not be \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n16 As defined by the World Health Organization, basic sanitation is the lowest-cost technology ensuring hygienic \nexcreta and sullage disposal and a clean and healthful living environment both at home and in the neighborhood of \nusers. Access to basic sanitation includes safety and privacy in the use of these services. Coverage is the \nproportion of people using improved sanitation facilities: public sewer connection, septic system connection, pour-\nflush latrine, simple pit latrine, and ventilated improved pit latrine. \n ", "5 \npossible to commission the scheme even though the distribution network and the elevated \ntowers will be completed by the second quarter of 2011. In addition, about 55,000 beneficiaries \nin Muttur, who are resettled internally displaced persons from the conflict and who were earlier \nimpacted by the 2004 tsunami, would not be able to benefit from the project. Overall, the project \nwould not be able to achieve its full scope and objectives. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $259.5 million (Table 1). \n \n18.   Since the approval of supplementary financing in 2006, project cost increased by $84.4 \nmillion. Most of the increase is being financed by the increase in the government\u2019s contribution. \nThe  total  shortfall  for  the  proposed  Muttur  scheme  is  estimated  at  $19.6  million  including \ncontingencies, interest payments, and taxes and duties. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n  Original  2006 Revised  2011 Revised  Funding Gap\nComponent  Cost  Cost  Cost Estimate \nEstimate  Estimate  a,b \nA.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $4.3  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction as applicable to be capitalized in the loan), \n ", "6 \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The \ngovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n20.  The  government  has  also  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR8.389 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n21.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Economic and financial analyses were updated for each water supply scheme in the four \ntowns.18 The project will benefit a population of 246,662 in Batticaloa; 145,524 in Hambantota; \n57,314 in Muttur; and 92,290 in Polonnaruwa in 2030 (the final year of analysis) by providing \ngood quality, reliable piped water in the areas. These figures are compared to 226,724 in \nBatticaloa; 133,029 in Hambantota; 49,490 in Muttur; and 84,128 in Polonnaruwa assumed at \nthe previous appraisal in 2006. Two major streams of economic benefits from water supply \nschemes are quantified: (i) resource cost savings for the non-incremental water supply from the \nproject including savings in time spent fetching water; savings in costs of replacement and \nrepair of wells, bores, jars and buckets, and transportation; and savings in medical costs spent \nfor waterborne diseases; and (ii) the value of the incremental water supply from the project. \nWithout the project, the average domestic water consumption is assumed at 60 liters per capita \nper day; and with the project, 100 liters per capita per day, in line with the assumption made at \nappraisal. The average household is assumed to save 43\u201376 minutes per day spent in fetching \nwater as a result of the project, and the time savings are evaluated at an unskilled wage rate of \nSLRs550 per day.19 Unquantifiable benefits from the project include (i) increased economic \nactivity in the areas resulting from the more reliable water supply infrastructure, (ii) appreciation \n                                                 \n18 Detailed Analysis of the Cost Overrun (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2009. Annual Report 2009. Colombo. (Table 46: Average Daily Wages in the Informal \nSector). \n ", "8 \nin land values caused by better access to basic services, and (iii) psychological benefits of \nresidents in the project areas from being designated priority areas by the government.   \n \n25.  Economic benefits for water supply were quantified and the economic internal rate of \nreturn  (EIRR)  was  found  to  be  highest  in  Batticaloa  (11.0%),  followed  by  Muttur  (9.5%), \nHambantota (7.4%), and Polonnaruwa (4.6%) in order of economic viability. For the four water \nsupply schemes combined, the overall EIRR is estimated at 9.1%. This compares with an \noverall EIRR of 10.0% estimated during the project reevaluation in 2006. While the overall \neconomic returns of the project have declined with the escalation of project costs, the overall \nproject is viable since (i) there is significant sunk costs incurred on the project; (ii) in the post-\nconflict era, significant economic development activity is occurring or planned to occur, which is \nlikely to result in further urban migration into the project areas leading to greater demand for \nwater from both domestic and nondomestic consumers; and (iii) a scarcity of water exists in \nthese  project  areas.  The  economic  analysis  excludes  indirect  secondary  benefits  such  as \nreduction  in  spending  on  healthcare  due  to  a  reduction  in  waterborne  disease  and  an \nimprovement in health. The updated economic returns estimated for the respective towns are \nshown in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Project Financial and Economic Analysis, 2001\u20132010 \n  Batticaloa  Muttur  Hambantota  Polonnaruwa \nItem  2001  2006  2010  2001  2006  2010  2001  2006  2010  2001  2006  2010 \nFinancial  NPV  +ve  (4,195)  (6,294)  +ve  (1,311)  (2,261)  +ve  (3,544)  (3,801)  +ve  (1,010)  (4,272) \n(SLRs million) \nFIRR (%)  5.3  -ve  (4.3)  3.6  -ve  (6.9)  1.9  -ve  (6.9)  1.2  -ve  (9.3) \nAIFC-Full Cost ($  16.8  66.8  93.7  18.2  65.5  102.6  28.2  74.6  129.1  13.1  65.7  142.9 \nmillion) \nAIFC \u2013 O&M Only  7.2  17.0  18.6  9.8  10.9  25.7  9.3  18.9  21.7  6.9  13.8  33.9 \n($ million) \nEIRR (%)  14.3  12.0  11.1  12.6  8.3  9.5  12.3  7.6  7.4  16.6  7.9  4.6 \n( ) = negative, +ve = positive, -ve = negative, AIFC = average incremental financial cost, FIRR = financial internal rate \nof return, NPV = net present value, O&M = operation and maintenance. Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n26.  As  agreed  with  the  government,  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  urban  schemes \nconstructed under the project is to be secured through the revision of tariffs to cover full \noperation and maintenance (O&M) throughout the life of the schemes. This is consistent with \nthe NWSDB\u2019s tariffs revision effected in February 2009 following which the effective water tariff \nrevenue (considering a 4% real increase in tariff annually) from each of the four water supply \nschemes will at minimum cover the incremental O&M costs, while three out of the four schemes \nwould also be able to cover debt servicing costs of the project.20 With the improved financial \nperformance of the NWSDB, following the tariff revisions in 2009, the capital costs of the project \ncan be recovered. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n20 The estimated effective water tariff for Hambantota is marginally below the average incremental financial cost \nconsidering O&M and debt servicing costs, although total revenue will be sufficient to cover debt service costs as \nwell. \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of capacity in service delivery  The project will ensure continuation of the project \nmanagement unit with the trained staff. \nEconomic growth cannot be easily projected  The project covers basic requirements for a 20-year \nprojected population and a conservative growth \npattern. \nEssential water tariff revisions are not undertaken   Government to assure in loan agreement to revise \nthe  tariffs  such  that  implementing  agency  will \nrecover at a minimum the costs of operation and \nmaintenance,  department  services,  and \ndepreciation.  \nThe bids participated in the pending ICB process  Since  the  bids  were  received  2  years  ago,  the \nfor civil works contract HW&T/UWS/PA2/MUT/ICB  contract award will be subject to the validity of the \nfor Muttur head works is not valid or the contract is  bids  and  ADB\u2019s  review  and  approval  of  the \nnot permissible for award.  technical and price bid evaluation in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s standard procurement procedures.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n28.  The government and the NWSDB under the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage have  \nassured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies \nincluding  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement, \nconsulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n29.
