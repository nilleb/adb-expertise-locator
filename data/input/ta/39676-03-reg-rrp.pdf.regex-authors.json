I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary  loan  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  CAREC  Regional  Road  Corridor \nImprovement Project. \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  Project Rationale \n2.  The road network is the backbone of the Kyrgyz Republic's agriculture industry, which \naccounts  for  over  30%  of  gross  domestic  product  and  employs  more  than  50%  of  the \npopulation. It also carries more than half the imports and exports from neighboring countries, \nand is essential for the growing tourism industry. The economy of the Kyrgyz Republic depends \nheavily on road links to neighboring countries and through them to the major aviation and \nmarine gateways, particularly in South Asia. Parts of these links are also vital for connecting \ndifferent parts of the country and thereby reducing provincial disparities. The government\u2019s \ncurrent goal is to upgrade all international and strategic roads to a uniform standard, but the \nemphasis will switch to local roads in the future.1   \n \n3.  Road development, which began in the mid-1990s, has accelerated in recent years, and \nthe government is now paying more attention to road pavement preservation and sustainability. \nBy 2009, it had increased routine road maintenance and small works expenditure to Som1.6 \nbillion (approximately $40 million)\u2014about seven times the expenditure in 2005. Multilateral and \nbilateral development partners have financed the bulk of road rehabilitation and reconstruction \nworks. The CAREC Regional Road Corridor Improvement Project,2 approved by the Board of \nDirectors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 24 October 20073 (the approved project), is \none in a series of projects financed by ADB in support of the government's efforts to make \nroads safe, efficient, and available year-round.  \n \n4.  The approved project's main component is the improvement of the road from Sary Tash \nto Karamik (at the Kyrgyz Republic\u2013Tajikistan border). This road is part of the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation4 (CAREC) corridors 3 and 5, which extend from Afghanistan to \nthe Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China (PRC) respectively. Improvements \nto some sections of corridors 3 and 5, particularly the road between Karamik and Dushanbe, \nare also financed by ADB. Under the approved project, the customs facilities at the Karamik \nborder post will be improved and the government's road maintenance unit and its practices will \nbe reformed. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n5.  The principal objectives of the approved project are to reduce transport costs and foster \nregional cooperation among the Kyrgyz Republic, the PRC, Tajikistan, and other Central Asian \n                                                 \n1  AKIpress. 2010. 750 km of Roads Rehabilitated in Kyrgyzstan in 2009. Bishkek: Kyrgyzstan News Agency (28 \nJanuary).  \n2  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan, Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grants, and Technical Assistance Grants to Kyrgyz Republic and Republic of Tajikistan for the \nCAREC Regional Road Corridor Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 2359, Grants 0084 and 0085, and TA 6415). \n3  The grant agreement was signed on 31 October 2007 and made effective on 6 February 2008. \n4  The CAREC program is a partnership of eight countries and six multilateral institutions working to promote \ndevelopment through cooperation, leading to accelerated economic growth and poverty reduction. ", "2 \ncountries. The road will improve access to regional markets and social services for people living \nalong the corridor. \n \n6.  The approved project will have two physical and two nonphysical outputs. The main \nphysical output is an improved 142-kilometer (km) road connecting Karamik and Sary Tash (km \n350\u2013km 492). The improvements will include rehabilitating an existing 30 km asphalt concrete \nsurfaced section (km 462\u2013km 492) and reconstruction of the remaining existing gravel- surfaced \nroad, river protection works, improvement of drainage systems, and road safety measures. The \napproved project will also replace deteriorated bridges, repair 12 bridges, and build four new \nbridges.  All  the  civil  works  have  been  designed  to  comply  with  national  highway  design \nstandards. The other output is a new passenger and vehicle inspection area with modern \nbuildings, equipment, and traffic channels at the border post in Karamik.5 \n \n7.  The nonphysical outputs are: (i) a tri-nation cross-border agreement among the PRC, \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan, to allow easy movement of people and goods across \nborders;6 and (ii) better road maintenance by procuring works from the private sector under \nperformance-based contracts. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n8.  The approved project is estimated to cost $39.5 million (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.  Base Cost   \n  1.

This \nincludes provision for potential exchange rate fluctuation under the assumption \nof a purchasing power parity exchange rate. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n9.  ADB provided a grant of $25.6 million from its Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe project. The government provided counterpart financing of $13.9 million to cover (i) taxes \nand  duties  related  to  all  civil  works  and  consulting  services,  (ii)  border  infrastructure \nimprovement  works,  and  (iii)  performance-based  maintenance  contracts.  The  summary \nfinancing plan is in Table 2. \n \n                                                 \n5  The government will finance this and the facilities at the Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC border crossing at Irkeshtam, which \nare also supported by ADB. 2004.

Status of and Progress in Project Implementation \n10.  Government  and  ADB  review  missions  have  visited  the  civil  works  site;  reviewed \nprogress reports, financial audit reports, and the operations of the project implementation unit, \nand found that the approved project is in compliance with the financial covenants and that the \ncivil works meet all technical and safeguard requirements. The civil works, which commenced \noperations on 1 December 2008, were 50% completed at the end of March 2010 (compared \nwith the anticipated 33%), and the supervision consultant has certified that the completed work \nmeets all standards and specifications.7 Disbursements amounted to about 40% of the civil \nworks allocation, and 51% of total financing. \n \n11.  However, the road maintenance component has progressed more slowly than the civil \nworks. The intent of this component is twofold: (i) to help restructure the road maintenance unit \nof the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC), and (ii) to improve maintenance \neffectiveness  by  outsourcing  the  works  by  2013.  The  government  has  demonstrated  its \ncommitment to this end by increasing maintenance funding.8 \n  \n12.  Progress  with  the  cross-border  agreement  and  the  customs  facility  improvement \ncomponent has also been slow. The government is committed to taking the action required to \ncomplete  the  cross-border  agreement.  However,  its  completion  and  implementation  before  \n31 December 2010, as required under the financial covenants, will depend on Tajikistan and the \nPRC  signing  the  agreement.  The  government  will  also  ensure  that  the  customs  facility \nimprovements are expedited and completed on time. The designs of the border infrastructure \nhave been completed and the government is expected to procure the works at the end of 2010. \nThe road works contractor is scheduled to complete paving the inspection area and traffic \nchannels in 2011.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \nA.  Proposed Changes \n13.  The government has requested financing for modifications to the road improvement \ncomponent of the approved project, i.e., paving the entire length of 136 km (instead of only 30 \nkm) with two layers (4 centimeters [cm] and 6 cm respectively) of asphalt concrete. The two \nlayers will be designed to standards and specifications required to achieve an international \nroughness index not exceeding 3.5 and a service life of 20 years on the entire road. The \nconsulting  services  provided  by  the  construction  supervision  team  and  the  project \n                                                 \n7  The  distance  between  Sary  Tash  and  Karamik  was  reduced  from  142  km  to  136  km  through  alignment \nimprovements and bridging to avoid built-up areas. These changes have been done in compliance with social and \nenvironmental safeguards, without any negative effects on the project's outcome and impact. The change was \nagreed between ADB and MOTC at the procurement stage and bids were called on 20 March 2008 for civil works \non 136 km. \n8  Annual spending on road maintenance has increased by 3%\u20135% since 2005 and vehicle weight controls are being \nimplemented. \n ", "4 \nimplementation team will be extended to ensure project delivery according to the specifications, \non time, and on budget. \n \nB.  Impact on the Project \n14.  The proposed changes will increase the approved project's overall impact because it will \nreduce transport costs further. The current travel time of 13 hours between Dushanbe and the \nKyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC border at Irkeshtam will be more than halved. The changes will require \ncivil works and consulting services to continue for about 18 months beyond the current contract \nend date of 21 May 2011 (i.e., until  1 November 2012). The milestones of some other activities, \noutcomes, and outputs will be postponed because of their start-up delays\u2014not because of the \nproposed  changes.  However,  the  project  completion  date  of  31  March  2013  will  remain \nunchanged. The revised project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Rationale \n15.  Although the feasibility study9 for the approved project concluded that a 5 cm layer of \nasphalt concrete would be needed on the entire road to support the estimated future traffic,10 \nADB financing for the road sector in the approved project was only sufficient to pave 30 km of \nthe 136 km road. However, the road network in southeast Kyrgyz Republic11 and Tajikistan is \ncurrently  being  improved  with  ADB  assistance  with  10\u201311  cm,  two-layer  asphalt  concrete \nsurfacing. ADB recently provided supplementary financing12 to Tajikistan to pave road sections \nbetween Karamik and Nimich, which were originally designed to have gravel surfacing.   \n \n16.  Current  traffic  volumes  in  other  major  road  links  in  the Kyrgyz  Republic  that  were \nimproved between 2004 and 2009 are more than twice the forecasts. Heavy vehicles constitute \na larger portion of the traffic than anticipated. The likelihood of similar increases in traffic volume \nand composition on the Sary Tash\u2013Karamik road is high. This and the findings of the feasibility \nstudy  fully  support  the  government's  proposal  to  pave  the  entire  road.  The  long-term \nserviceability and life-cycle cost advantages further support the government\u2019s proposal to use a \n10 cm two-layer asphalt concrete surfacing instead of a single 5 cm layer surfacing.   \n \n17.  The government has confirmed, and the project team has determined, that the project \ncontinues to be a priority in its development strategy. The transport sector is performing well \nand the percentage of primary network roads in good condition and the level of network usage \nhave  improved  since 2005.  Reforms,  in  line  with  the  financial  covenants  of  the  approved \nproject, have also contributed to these improvements. Overall, the proposed supplementary \nfinancing  complies  with  the  eligibility  criteria  set  out  in  ADB's  Policy  on  Supplementary \nFinancing.13 It is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2009\u20132011,14 the \n                                                 \n9  BCEOM. 2007.

Brussels (December). \n10 The study concluded that, in the absence of adequate financing, at the very least, the section from km 0 to km 72 \nshould be paved with a 5 cm layer of asphalt concrete. \n11 ADB. 2004.

Implementation progress, compliance with finance agreement covenants, and \nprogress toward attainment of the development objectives, as described in paras. 10\u201312, are \nsatisfactory  and  positive.  The  proposed  supplementary  loan  will  be  the  first  provision  of \nsupplementary financing to the approved project, and is less than the total ADB financing for the \nproject  to  date.  With  the  proposed  changes,  the  approved  project  will  remain  technically \nfeasible, economically viable, and financially sustainable.   \n \nD.  Safeguards \n18.  There  will  be  no  land  acquisition,  involuntary  resettlement,  or  impacts  on  the \nenvironment  and  indigenous  peoples  as  a  result  of  the  change.  The  project  will  remain \nclassified as environmental category B. Much of the additional work will be in sections through \nbarren  areas.  A  sound  environmental  management  plan,  which  adequately  covers  the \nadditional work, is currently in place and MOTC reports the environmental quality every month \nto ADB. No adverse impacts have been reported to date, and none are expected due to the \nproposed  changes.  The  supplement  to  the  initial  environmental  examination  includes  the \nrevisions to the environmental management plan and the grievance redress mechanism.16 \n \nE.  Revised Cost Estimates \n19.  The  changes  are  estimated  to  cost  $32  million.

Revised Financing Plan \n20.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR \n15,189,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will have \na 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement.

Implementation Arrangements \n21.  MOTC, the executing agency for the approved project, and the project implementation \nunit (which was renamed the investment project implementation group in June 2010) will remain \nunchanged  and  will  continue  to  manage  the  project.  The  renaming  has  not  changed  its \nstructure, responsibilities, staff, or the lines of communication with MOTC. All donor-financed \nprojects are now under one group with a director in charge of overall operations and a deputy \ndirector  serving  as  the  focal  person  for  ADB  projects.  The  activities  financed  from  the \nsupplementary loan will be implemented over 18 months.  \n \n22.  According to the first procurement plan of the approved project, civil works were to be \nprocured as three packages using ADB's international competitive bidding procedure. However, \nearly in the procurement process, the government felt that competition for small packages was \nlimited. Therefore, during the inception mission, the three were combined into one package, and \nbids  were  called  on  21  March  2008.  ADB's  procurement  committee  agreed  with  MOTC's \nevaluation, and the contract was awarded to the lowest responsive bidder on 6 October 2008 at \na price of $22.9 million including $2 million for contingencies.18 The contract price for the \npavement works\u20145 cm (single) layer of asphalt concrete over 56 km\u2014was $6.1 million.  \n \n23.  MOTC has proposed procuring additional works through a variation of the original civil \nworks contract instead of through new procurement.  It has received an expression of interest \nfrom the contractor for the additional works and a set of likely unit prices, including prices for the \ntwo new items\u2014the second layer with a 4% bitumen content and the tack coat between layers. \nThe total estimated cost of these works is $20.3 million. However, supplies of imported road \nconstruction  materials  and  petroleum  products  from  the  traditional  producers,  particularly \nbitumen  and  diesel,  are  becoming  unreliable  and  costly.  This  is  mainly  because  of  the \nincreasing  demand  for  these  materials  in  the  source  countries  and  intermittent  export \nrestrictions. The political changes and the civil unrest in the Kyrgyz Republic in April and June \n2010 also contributed to the price escalation, which is expected to continue in the near future. \nThe government has found suppliers of road construction materials and petroleum products in \nnonmember  countries  of  ADB.  These  are  reliable  and  offer  lower  prices.  The  total  cost \nrepresents a relatively small amount of the supplementary loan (around 5%). To enable the \ngovernment to source from the least expensive producers, and thereby maximize the project\u2019s \ndevelopment impact and economic efficiency, it is proposed that road construction materials \nand petroleum products procured from nonmember countries of ADB be eligible for financing \nunder the supplementary loan.  \n                                                 \n17 Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category and Financier (Appendix 2). \n18 The price of the other bid was 15.6% higher. ", "7 \n24.  ADB  has  performed  comparative  analyses  of  the  material  and  time  cost  of  new \nprocurement versus contract variation, and found that a variation would be more economical \nthan new procurement.19  The estimated total cost of works, if newly procured, is $26 million20\u2014\nabout $6.0 million more than the contract variation. The indirect cost of delays, and the practical \ndifficulties that a new contractor will face, are also relevant. The earliest a new contractor could \nstart would be June 2011 (the current contract ends on 30 May 2011), which would push the \nproject completion date to the end of 2013 (past the current grant closing date). Moreover, \ntransferring the defects liability to a new contractor, and placing the second layer 2 years after \nplacing the first layer of asphalt, are impractical. Therefore, MOTC's proposal is fully justified. \n \n25.  Likewise,  MOTC's  proposal  for  procuring  the  additional  consulting  services  for \nconstruction  supervision  through  a  contract  variation  is  justified.  The  services  include \napproximately 15 person-months of international consultants' input and 60 person-months of \nnational consultants' input. This method of procurement will also be less disruptive to the \ncontractor\u2013consultant  working  relationship.  The  services  of  national  and/or  international \nspecialists  to  assist  the  investment  project  implementation  group  with  administering  the \ncontracts and solving complex problems will be engaged according to national and ADB's \nprocurement procedures for recruitment of individual consultants. The firm engaged to carry out \nannual financial audits will continue its services until the end of the project and any additional \ncosts will be covered from the budget allocation for consulting services. Under the consulting \nservices category, MOTC will also procure training and related material such as manuals and \nsoftware on project management to build its capacity for in project management.  \n \n26.  ADB  Management  has,  in  principle,  approved  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing from the loan proceeds for expenditures incurred on eligible civil works and consulting \nservices. The government was informed that advance contracting must comply with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time) for expenditures to be eligible for retroactive \nfinancing. Once the loan becomes effective, up to 20% of the proceeds may be used to \nretroactively finance eligible expenditures incurred during the period not exceeding 6 months \nprior to signing of the loan agreement. The government acknowledges that advance contracting \nprior to signing of the loan agreement is undertaken at its own risk. Concurrence by ADB on \nadvance contracting does not commit ADB to finance any expenditures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and \nMOTC. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other \nservices  provided  as  they  relate  to  the  project.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  revisions  to  the  project  administration \nmemorandum of the approved project.21  \n \n                                                 \n19 Comparison of Unit Prices and Cost Estimates (Appendix 2). \n20 At 2009 prices. \n21 Implementation Arrangements and Revisions to the Project Administration Memorandum (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n27.  The advantages of the proposed change include a longer service life for the road, more \nopportunities to use recycled materials, and ease of overlaying. The resultant higher speeds will \nreduce travel time and vehicle operating costs. An economic analysis was done assuming that \nthe cost consists of (i) capital expenditure, including physical contingencies; and (ii) operation \nand maintenance expenditure, and the benefit consists of (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, \nand (ii) savings in travel time.  \n \n28.  The benefit stems from the estimated travel time savings because the average travel \nspeed on the road will increase from 30 kilometers per hour (km/h) to 60 km/h (instead of 40 \nkm/h22 with the approved project). Likewise, the estimated operating costs will decline because \nthe average pavement roughness index will drop from 15.0 to 3.0 (it will drop to only 6.5 with \napproved project). Moreover, the maintenance cost savings, especially winter maintenance, and \nthe service life of the pavement will be substantially higher. Together, these will yield a net \npresent value of $318 million and an economic internal rate of return of 19%, compared with \n18% for the approved project. A sensitivity test has confirmed that, even with a 20% increase in \ncapital expenditure and a 20% reduction in operational savings, the return will be 14%.23 \n \n29.  Surfacing will increase access to and from the communities within the corridor because \npublic transport and private vehicles will be able to use the road year-round, thereby reducing \ntravel time to market, social services, and employment and educational opportunities. Although \ndifficult to quantify, health benefits are likely from the substantial reduction in vehicle-induced \ndust and noise from the paved surface compared with the original unpaved surface. Public \nawareness campaigns financed and organized under the civil works contracts and MOTC's \ncontinued  consultation  with  local  communities  will  help  minimize  the  social  implications  of \nincreased traffic. \n \n30.  The risk of cost overruns caused by large increases in material and equipment costs \ncited in the report and recommendation of the approved project (footnote 2) will increase \nbecause of the high value of the material for the new pavement surface. In addition to assuring \nfinancing, the government will negotiate escalation limits or a guaranteed maximum price with \nthe contractor to contain the cost within the budget and minimize the risk of cost overruns. \nMOTC will implement measures such bumps on the road, signs, and police surveillance to \nreduce the traffic accident risks and noise caused by higher vehicle speeds.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n31.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the \nproject administration memorandum and legal documents. The government has agreed with \nADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  supplementary  loan \nagreement. \n                                                 \n22 The speed increase will be 30 km/h to 60 km/h only in a 30 km section of the road.   \n23 Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). ", "9 \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n32.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the supplementary \nloan in various currencies equivalent to SDR15,189,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic for the CAREC \nRegional Road Corridor Improvement Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n33.  I also recommend that the Board approve the proposal set forth in paragraph 23 of this \nreport  that road  construction  materials  and  petroleum  products  procured  from  nonmember \ncountries of ADB be eligible for financing under the supplementary loan. If this recommendation \nis not approved and the Board only approves the recommendations in paragraph 32, then road \nconstruction materials and petroleum products procured only from member countries of ADB \nwill be eligible for financing under the supplementary loan. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n30 August 2010 ", "10  Appendix 1 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  Data \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nContribution to  Tajikistan-Kyrgyz Republic  Economic and social  Political stability and strong \nreducing transport  trade increases from 27,236  statistics produced  macroeconomic performance in the \ncosts and fostering  tons in 2006 to 250,000 tons  by the National  Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan \nregional trade and  in 2015  Statistics Committee   \ncooperation among      Continued commitment of Kyrgyz \nthe Kyrgyz Republic,  Tajikistan-PRC trade  Statistics from  Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan \nPeople\u2019s Republic of  increases from 14,260 tons  international  governments to regional cooperation \nChina (PRC),  in 2006 to 1,000,000 tons in  organizations   \nTajikistan, and other  2015 (the PRC\u2019s share of    Continued external assistance to the \nCentral Asian  Tajikistan\u2019s total imports    road subsector in the Kyrgyz Republic \ncountries  increases from 11% to 20%)  and Tajikistan \n   \nPRC-Afghanistan trade \nincreases from 0 tons in \n2006 to 500,000 tons in \n2015 (the PRC\u2019s share of \nAfghanistan\u2019s total trade \nincreases from 0% to 10%) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved access to  Daily international freight  Economic and social  Ongoing improvements of parts of the \nmarkets and social  traffic on the project road  statistics produced  Corridor implemented as planned; \nservices  increases from about 10  by the National  Corridor adequately maintained, and \ntrucks in 2006 to 120 trucks  Statistics Committee  border control processing improved \nin 2015     \n  ADB project  Continued commitment of the \nDomestic traffic on the  completion report  governments of the Kyrgyz Republic and \nproject road increases from    Tajikistan to complete improvement of \n250 AADT in 2006 to 750  MOTC surveys and  connecting regional road corridors \nAADT in 2015  project performance   \n  management  No deterioration in the availability and \nTraffic accidents on the  system  quality of secondary education in the \nCorridor reduces from 14  project area \naccidents per 250 AADT in   \n2006 to 14 per 750 AADT in  No deterioration in the availability and \n2015  quality of health care in the project area \n    \nTravel time between Sary  Risk \nTash and Karamik reduced  Forecast of internationally generated \nfrom 4 hours in 2009 to 2.5  traffic may not materialize if above \nhours by end-2012  assumptions do not prove true. \n \nNumber of children in the \nproject area attending \nsecondary school increases \nfrom 95% in 2007 to 99% in \n2015 \n \nAgricultural, horticultural, \nand livestock production in \nthe project area increases \nfrom 100,000 tons in 2006 to \n160,000 tons in 2015 ", "Appendix 1  11 \n  Data \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
