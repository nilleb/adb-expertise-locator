INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help implement the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Integrated Trade Agenda (CITA) 2030, which was \nendorsed at the 17th CAREC Ministerial Conference in November 2018.1 Under the framework \nof the CAREC 2030 strategy,2 the CAREC Program aims to strengthen its role as a catalyst for \ntrade  expansion  and  economic  diversification  to  enhance  the  growth  potential  of  CAREC \ncountries and improve people\u2019s living standards. Such direction reinforces the pivotal role of trade \nas a means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.3 \n \n2.  CITA 2030 aims to help CAREC members integrate further into the global economy \nthrough trade expansion from increased market access, greater diversification, and stronger trade \ninstitutions. The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s (i) Strategy 2030 \noperational priority on regional cooperation and integration;4 and (ii) Operational Plan for Regional \nCooperation  and  Integration,  2016\u20132020,  specifically,  operational  direction  2  on  raising \ncompetitiveness in connected markets.5 The TA activities include policy advice, research, and \ncapacity building identified in CITA 2030\u2019s rolling strategic action plan (RSAP), 2018\u20132020.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The global and regional trade landscape is rapidly evolving with the recent revival of global \ntrade and the changing circumstances in the CAREC region. Excluding data from the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC),  CAREC  members  trade  performance  rebounded  from  tepid \nperformance in 2016, with merchandise trade expanding 12.8% and commercial trade in services \nincreasing 7.3% in 2017. However, the escalation of international trade conflict in 2018 and policy \nuncertainties could undermine the recent trends. Furthermore, the global trade share of CAREC \nmembers plateaued at less than 1% (excluding the PRC, which accounted for 11.5%) during \n2009\u20132017.7 Exports from Central Asia show high product concentration and divergence from the \nglobal pattern. Compared with other regions in Asia and the Pacific, CAREC members are the \nleast integrated regionally in terms of trade, investment, and movement of people.8 \n \n4.  The importance of trade for CAREC countries cannot be emphasized enough; goods and \nservices trade made up 42.5% of CAREC countries\u2019 (excluding the PRC) gross domestic product \nin 2016, lower than the average of 55.4% during 2010\u20132015. CAREC recognizes the importance \nof simplifying and liberalizing national trade regimes, including through World Trade Organization \n(WTO) membership, to expand trade and improve the investment climate. However, the potential \nto increase trade within CAREC is limited by high trade costs and delays at and behind the borders. \nFor instance, border compliance procedures result in an average time to import of 53 hours and \nan average time to export of 58 hours.9 Better implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

Most  CAREC  countries  continue  to  rely  heavily  on  primary  and  resource-intensive \ncommodities for export, which affects their participation in global and regional value chains. \nRegulatory and institutional reforms are needed to attract investments and expand services trade, \nas inconsistent and restrictive foreign direct investment policies make it difficult to realize the \npotential for cross-border investment facilitation. Meanwhile, the services sector, including air \npassenger transport, auditing, banking, insurance, and communication and professional services, \nremains highly restrictive in most CAREC countries.10 There is a need to create a more favorable \nbusiness environment including adoption of innovative measures and improve export capacity \nand  participation  in  the  supply  chain  by  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  female \nentrepreneurs, including their access to trade finance.  \n \n6.  Underpinning effective implementation of trade strategies and reforms is the quality of \ninstitutions  and  regulatory  governance.  However,  CAREC  trade  institutions  face  ineffective \nmechanisms, uncoordinated national and regional planning, and regulatory fragmentation. There \nis also a dearth of up-to-date and relevant information, appropriate skills, and knowledge of \nemerging trade issues for government officials to (i) assess and design policies and (ii) arrive at \ninformed decisions to amend or replace outdated trade-related legislations. \n \n7.  Since its inception, CAREC has contributed to building mutual trust and advancing \nregional cooperation, and has recorded successes with knowledge and institution building in the \ntrade sector. However, progress among CAREC members has been uneven. The remaining \nchallenges include limited outcomes, inadequate investment planning in trade facilitation, lack of \nflagship projects for knowledge support and actionable policy recommendations in trade policy, \nlukewarm country ownership, and shortcomings in coordination and overlapping issues in trade.11 \n \n8.  As envisaged in CAREC 2030, a coherent approach to trade through the development of \na forward-looking regional trade strategy is needed. Among CAREC 2030\u2019s five operational \nclusters,12 the trade, tourism, and economic corridors cluster includes support for WTO accession \nand post-accession, TFA implementation, deepened customs cooperation, and integrated trade \nfacilitation. Trade-related priorities are spread out across all CAREC 2030 operational clusters, \nunderscoring the cross-sector linkages, broader scope, and new opportunities in CAREC trade \nwork. \n \n9.  CITA  2030  will  be  implemented  in  a  phased  and  pragmatic  approach,  taking  into \nconsideration the capacity and varying levels of progress of CAREC countries. There will be \nflexibility in allowing two or more CAREC members to initiate and implement regional projects and \ninitiatives agreed by them. A 3-year RSAP translates CITA into practical and implementable \nperiodic phases, while annual reviews help maintain the RSAP\u2019s relevance. The RSAP, 2018\u2013\n2020 identifies investment projects, policy dialogue and cooperation, and knowledge products \nand services prioritized by CAREC countries for the first 3 years of CITA 2030 implementation. \n \n                                                \n10 World  Bank.

The use of information and \ncommunication technology is a cross-cutting priority of CAREC operations. \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: integration of CAREC countries in the global \neconomy enhanced (footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: policy measures to \nenhance the trade performance of CAREC countries adopted.13 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Knowledge support on increasing market access provided. Through policy \nadvice and capacity building activities, the TA will support CAREC countries in adopting open \ntrade policies and deepening customs cooperation. Activities will focus on: (i) WTO accession \nand support for CAREC members in their post-accession commitments; (ii) trade policy review; \n(iii) support for implementation of WTO agreements, such as on sanitary and phytosanitary \nmeasures,  technical  barriers  to  trade,  and  the  TFA;  and  (iv)  scoping  studies  for  potential \ninvestment projects to improve border services, establish a new border-crossing point with joint \ncustoms control, and enhance the transit system in CAREC countries. \n \n12.  Output 2: Policy research on economic diversification produced and disseminated. \nThe TA will help create an enabling environment for diversification by supporting policy reforms \nand identifying opportunities to expand CAREC countries\u2019 links to regional and global value chains. \nAreas of policy research work include investment policies and cross-border investment measures; \nexpansion of services trade and its support services; and promotion of digital trade, innovation, \nand regional value chain development. Sharing of best practices, including through field visits, \nwill be implemented under the TA. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Trade  institutions\u2019  capacity  in  policy  coordination,  analysis,  and \nnegotiations strengthened. The TA will improve coordination of sector policies and priorities, \npromote evidence-based policy making, and enhance the capacity of trade-related institutions \nand cross-sector mechanisms such as the WTO national committees on trade facilitation. The TA \nwill provide a platform to discuss trade issues in a synergistic manner through the Regional Trade \nGroup (RTG) and the Customs Cooperation Committee (CCC). The TA will support activities to \nimprove data collection and information sharing among CAREC countries; deepen knowledge \nand  awareness  of  emerging  trade  issues,  including  the  scope  of  trade  agreements;  and \nstrengthen  the  participation  of  other  stakeholders  such  as  think  tanks  and  private  sector \nassociations in trade policy discussions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,600,000 equivalent, of which (i) $800,000 equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund14 and (ii) $800,000 \nequivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction \nand Regional Cooperation Fund15 and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2.  \n \n                                                \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14 Established by ADB.

The  governments  of  each  CAREC  country  will  provide  in-kind  contributions  for  the \nimplementation of TA activities and support in the form of staff time and designated personnel \nwho will (i) participate in RTG and CCC meetings and other subgroups as may be established, \nand (ii) provide needed data and timely information. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. The Public Management, Financial Sector, and Regional \nCooperation Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will serve as the focal point and supervise \nactivities, working closely with the CAREC unit of the Central and West Asia Department, the \nresident missions in CAREC countries, and ADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional Cooperation \nDepartment particularly on knowledge products. TA implementation will be coordinated with \nongoing regional TA,16 the CAREC Institute, the Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative,17 and \nother development partners to create synergies among regional initiatives. \n \n17.  The TA outcomes will feed into the discussions of the CCC, RTG, and relevant sector \nbodies as may be established under CITA 2030. The TA will provide support to monitor progress \nand update the RSAP annually. It will incorporate lessons learned in past regional TA, such as \nthe adoption of the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach and sustained dialogue with countries to establish a link \nbetween strategy and investment projects.18 The implementation arrangements are summarized \nin the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  February 2019\u2013June 2021 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  EAPF will implement the TA in consultation with concerned sector \ndivisions and resident missions in CAREC countries. \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual selection  International expertise  $706,035 \n(32 person-months) \nIndividual selection  National expertise (30  $280,331 \nperson-months) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) and front-loading ADB-administered funds. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; CAREC = Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation; EAPF = Public Management, \nFinancial Sector, and Regional Cooperation Division of the East Asia Department; TA = technical assistance; WTO = \nWorld Trade Organization. \nSource: ADB. \n \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2016.

ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions.19 The TA will require 32 person-months of international and 30 person-months \nof national consultant inputs. ADB will recruit consultants individually and not through a firm \nbecause (i) the range of required experience, expertise, and specific knowledge or familiarity of \nthe CAREC Program and countries for each assignment is unlikely to be available in a single firm; \n(ii) faster mobilization of consultants and resource persons to conduct TA activities is needed; \nand (iii) greater flexibility is needed to engage experts in a broad spectrum of trade-related work. \nThe Public Management, Financial Sector, and Regional Cooperation Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia \nDepartment will manage all individual consultants. Where appropriate, output-based contracts will \nbe considered for administrative efficiency and for a simplified disbursement process. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.
