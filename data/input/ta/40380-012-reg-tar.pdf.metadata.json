INTRODUCTION \n1.  Over the last decade and particularly after the global financial and economic crisis in \n2008, the geo-economic landscape of the world economy has been rapidly changing. Asia has \nincreasingly been assuming a larger role in the world economy. Regional cooperation and \nintegration  in  Asia  is  on  the  rise,  and  Asian  countries  are  fostering  greater  and  more \ncomprehensive economic partnerships with each other with the aim of reducing overreliance on \ndeveloped markets for growth. It is against this changing economic landscape in Asia that \nmember countries of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic \nCooperation (BIMSTEC)1 are actively accelerating cooperation in the BIMSTEC region.  \n \n2.  In 2006, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided assistance for the preparation of \nthe BIMSTEC Transport Infrastructure and Logistics Study (BTILS). In December 2009, the 12th \nBIMSTEC Ministerial Meeting endorsed the BTILS recommendations. Subsequently, in January \n2011,  with  the  goal  of  facilitating  cooperation  in  BIMSTEC,  the  13th  BIMSTEC  Ministerial \nMeeting agreed to establish the BIMSTEC Secretariat in Dhaka, Bangladesh, marking this as an \nimportant milestone in BIMSTEC cooperation. \n \n3.  The BIMSTEC Working Group at its meeting in Bangkok on 25 March 2011 requested \nADB to provide support to implement the recommendations of the BTILS. Subsequently, ADB \nfielded a mission in May 2011 to Dhaka, Bangladesh and held consultations with the BIMSTEC \nSecretariat. The design and monitoring framework provides the expected impact, outcome, and \noutputs of the TA (Appendix 1).2 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The BIMSTEC countries have a combined population of about 1.4 billion, representing \n21% of the world population. The region, with its large population, high economic growth, and \ncumulative gross domestic product, has the potential to serve as a trading bridge between \nSouth and Southeast Asia. This potential has become more important with the recent global \neconomic crisis, which hurt Asian economies, particularly exports. The collapse of demand from \ndeveloped markets, among other factors, resulted in the deterioration of Asian exports. For \nexample, from 2007 to 2008 exports of member countries of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) decreased by 17.48%; exports of member countries of the South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation decreased by 7.8%.3 \n \n5.  Like other Asian countries, BIMSTEC countries have relied on developed markets for \ntheir exports. In 2007, for example, before the 2008 global crisis, 20.46% of Indian exports went \nto the European Union, 13.67% to the United States, and 2.21% to Japan. Similarly, 36.65% of \ntotal exports from Sri Lanka went to the European Union, while 25.82% went to the United \nStates. The proportion of intra-trade among BIMSTEC countries was therefore very low at only \n7.64% of their total trade.4 \n                                                \n1 BIMSTEC was established in June 1997 as an interregional group to promote cross-border trade, \ninvestment, tourism, and technical cooperation within the region. Member countries include Bangladesh, \nBhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. The participation of Myanmar in activities to be \nsupported by this TA in other BIMSTEC countries may occur in accordance with ADB\u2019s Myanmar \nstrategy, March 2010, as amended from time to time.  \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 December 2011.  \n3  International Monetary Fund. 2008. Directions of Trade Statistics. Dhaka. \n4  BIMSTEC Newsletter. January 2010. http://www.bimstec.org/Newsletter_XXIV.pdf \n ", "2     \n6.  Asia, in general, and BIMSTEC countries, in particular, must diversify their sources of \ngrowth, including diverting trade from outside Asia to within Asia. However, Asian markets are \nfragmented. The fragmentation is exacerbated by various bilateral and multilateral preferential \ntrading arrangements. Thus, Asia needs to focus its efforts on facilitating market integration \nwithin various subregional markets, such as ASEAN, BIMSTEC, the Greater Mekong Subregion, \nthe Pacific Forum, and the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation; and use these as \nbuilding  blocks  for  greater  pan-Asian  integration.  In  this  context,  BIMSTEC\u2014as  the  only \ninterregional mechanism between South and East Asia\u2014is one of the most important regional \nmechanisms  to  help  transform  Asia  into  an  integrated  market  and  production  base.  For \nBIMSTEC to achieve this aim, it must consolidate and strengthen its institutional architecture. \n \n7.  At the request of the BIMSTEC countries, ADB helped prepare the BTILS report. The \nreport  included  specific  recommendations  for  strengthening  the  institutional  structure  of \nBIMSTEC  to  expedite  regional  cooperation  in  transport  and  trade  facilitation.  The  12th \nMinisterial  Meeting  in  December  2009  endorsed  these  recommendations,  which  include \nestablishing (i) a ministerial conference of relevant transport ministries for policy coordination \nand decision-making; (ii) a sector committee on transport and logistics at the  secretary or \npermanent secretary level; and (iii) five expert groups for subsector technical discussions and \nproject implementation, preferably at the director general or joint secretary level. These expert \ngroups  include  road  development,  railways,  maritime  transport,  aviation,  and  transport \nfacilitation and logistics.  \n \n8.  The  BIMSTEC  Working  Group  meeting  held  on  25  March  2011  requested  ADB \nassistance in enhancing BIMSTEC institutional arrangements through convening the sector \ncommittee on transport and meetings of expert groups. The sector committee can help with \noverall transport sector coordination. The five expert groups will coordinate, monitor, and review \nprogress with project implementation in their sector, and report on implementation progress to \nthe sector committee. This can help strengthen the coordination of projects and activities under \nthe BIMSTEC Transport Cooperation Agenda, including the action plan and implementation \nprogram. To expedite the process, the BIMSTEC countries nominated members for the five \nexpert groups in May 2011.    \n \n9.  The 13th BIMSTEC Ministerial Meeting in January 2011 endorsed the establishment of \nthe BIMSTEC Secretariat in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The secretariat will play a critical role in \nfacilitating regional cooperation in BIMSTEC countries, especially in the areas of cross-border \nconnectivity  and  trade.  The  countries  are  developing  specific  terms  of  reference  for  the \nsecretariat.   \n \n10.  The  TA  aims  to  strengthen  the  BIMSTEC  institutional  mechanism,  including  (i)  the \nBIMSTEC Secretariat, and (ii) the sector committee on transport and the expert groups. The TA \nis consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 20205 and Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy \n(pillar on Regional and Subregional Cooperation Programs, and pillar on Trade and Investment \nCooperation and Integration).6 The TA is included in the pipeline of the regional cooperation \noperations business plan for South Asia, 2012\u20132014.7   \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008.

The expected impact of the TA is enhanced regional cooperation and integration in the \nBIMSTEC region. \n \n12.  The expected outcome is an increase in the capacity of the BIMSTEC Secretariat and \nother BIMSTEC institutions, such as the sector committee on transport, the expert groups, and \ngovernment  entities  in  member  countries.  This  will  be  accomplished  through  the  effective \nplanning and implementation of regional cooperation activities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA outputs are expected to help attain the desired impact and outcomes through \nvarious meetings of BIMSTEC expert groups, ministerial meetings, exchange visits, training \ncourses, establishment of a BIMSTEC website, and preparation of policy papers.    \n \n14.  The  expected  outputs  are  (i)  strengthened  BIMSTEC  regional  bodies,  and  \n(ii) strengthened BIMSTEC Secretariat. Key activities to achieve the first output include updating \nof the BTILS, and organization of meetings of road, railways, maritime, aviation, and transport \nfacilitation  and  logistics;  a  ministerial  conference  of  relevant  transport  ministries,  and  a \nBIMSTEC transport infrastructure finance conference. Key activities to support the achievement \nof  the  second  output  include  the  establishment  of  a  BIMSTEC  website  at  the  BIMSTEC \nSecretariat, visits to ADB headquarters, regional secretariats, and external training courses.  \nADB will organize all the activities. The design and monitoring framework describes the TA \nactivities and estimated time frames (Appendix 1).     \n \n15.  The TA will be successfully implemented with the assumption that BIMSTEC countries \nremain committed to pursuing BIMSTEC regional cooperation. Potential risks could include \ndisagreements or disputes that may arise among member countries of BIMSTEC, and/or that \ngovernment agencies concerned may be resistant to facilitating BIMSTEC cooperation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  It is proposed that ADB provide the equivalent of $750,000, on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The governments of member countries of the \nBay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) will \nprovide logistic and administrative support (in kind) for BIMSTEC meetings and conferences \norganized in their countries. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented from February 2012 to July 2013. ADB will be the executing \nagency, in collaboration with the BIMSTEC Working Group and other BIMSTEC bodies, the \nBIMSTEC Secretariat, and relevant government agencies in BIMSTEC countries. A team of \nADB staff from the South Asia Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division will \nbe responsible for overall TA administration. The BIMSTEC Working Group, together with the \nBIMSTEC Secretariat will be the focal agencies for BIMSTEC countries. Disbursements under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n ", "4     \n \n18.  The TA will require a total of 48 person-months of international and national consultancy \nservices: 18 person-months of international services, and 30 person-months of national services. \nThe international consultants will assist in reviewing and updating the BTILS, and undertake \nvarious  tasks  as  requested  by  the  BIMSTEC  Secretariat  and  BIMSTEC  Working  Group.  \nNational consultants will include a senior program analyst and a web designer. The analyst will \nbe based at ADB headquarters to help implement the TA. A local web design specialist will be \nbased in Dhaka, Bangladesh to support the BIMSTEC Secretariat in developing a website. ADB \nwill engage the international and national consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). All consultants will be recruited \nindividually and selected on the basis of their qualifications for the assignment. The consultants \nwill  work  on  an  intermittent  basis  (Appendix  3  provides  outline  terms  of  reference).  All \nprocurement of goods or equipment, if any, will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). For the workshops, and exchange visits, an \nadvance  payment  facility  may  be  used  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).    \n \n19.  The progress of TA implementation will be monitored through regular progress reports \nand  regular  consultation  meetings.  Outcome  evaluation  will  be  monitored  using  intended \noutcomes  and  outputs.  Lessons  identified,  research  papers  prepared  under  the  TA,  the \nprogress report, and the outcome evaluation report will be disseminated through and shared \nwith the BIMSTEC Working Group, BIMSTEC Secretariat, and relevant BIMSTEC sector bodies. \nProgress  reports  will  be  circulated  to  selected  stakeholders  and  posted  on  the  BIMSTEC \nwebsite.  \n \nIV.
