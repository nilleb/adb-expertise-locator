The Asian Development Bank (ADB) established its Carbon Market Program in 2006 \n(then called the Carbon Market Initiative). The Carbon Market Program has three components: \nthe Asia Pacific Carbon Fund (APCF), Future Carbon Fund (FCF), and Technical Support \nFacility  (TSF).  The  TSF  provides  capacity  building,  due  diligence,  documentation,  and \nimplementation support for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation activities. The TSF commenced \nsupporting GHG mitigation efforts through two technical assistance (TA) projects: (i) Preparing \nClean Energy Projects Eligible for the Clean Development Mechanism1, and (ii) Implementation \nof the Technical Support Facility under the Carbon Market Initiative2. Both TA projects were \ndesigned to assist low-carbon projects in developing member countries (DMCs) benefit from a \nsingle regulated carbon market mechanism\u2014the clean development mechanism (CDM). The \nsuccessful implementation of these TA projects allowed ADB to scale up from less than 10 CDM \nprojects in 2006 to over 100 projects seeking to register with the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2012. A follow-on TA, Supporting the Use of \nCarbon Financing to Promote Green Growth in Asia and the Pacific, was approved by the ADB \nBoard of Directors in November 2012.3 Under this TA, ADB continues to support DMCs in \nbenefiting  from  existing  carbon  markets,  primarily  through  CDM-eligible  projects,  and \ndevelopment of domestic emission trading schemes, including their linkages. The experience \nand lessons learned from the implementation of previous TAs especially in building institutional \ncapacities and imparting technical knowledge on carbon market instruments will help ADB in \nsupporting new carbon market mechanisms and contribute to its ongoing efforts in mitigating the \nchallenges of climate change.  \n \n2.  Under Strategy 2020, ADB is responding to climate change as part of the broader \nagenda of promoting environmentally sustainable growth in Asia and the Pacific.4 Based on the \nmidterm review of Strategy 20205, during 2014\u20132020, ADB will continue its support for tackling \nclimate change and will, among other things, help DMCs access other sources of environment \nand climate finance by increasing its engagement with international financing mechanisms such \nas the Green Climate Fund and new carbon market mechanisms. ADB\u2019s Addressing Climate \nChange  in  Asia  and the  Pacific:  Priorities for Action (approved  in  April  2010)  also  places \nemphasis  on  carbon  market  development  as  a  means  to  help  DMCs  mobilize  additional \nfinancing  to  support  climate  change  mitigation  activities.6 Most  of  the  country  partnership \nstrategies prepared for the past few years identify climate change as a development issue and \nincorporate actions to address it.  \n \n3.    There is growing interest from DMCs for new carbon market mechanisms, such as \nbilateral mechanisms, as a potential source of carbon financing and technology transfer to \npromote green growth. The existing regulated international carbon markets are defined by Kyoto \nmechanism tools - CDM, Joint Implementation, and Emission Trading. However, since the end \nof the first commitment period of Kyoto Protocol in 2012, new carbon market mechanisms such \nas domestic emission trading scheme, framework of various approaches, bilateral crediting \n                                                \n1 ADB.  2006.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nmechanisms, nationally appropriate mitigation actions, and sectoral crediting mechanism are \nbeing designed and implemented by various countries. Some of the countries are also working \non  implementing  carbon  tax  regimes,  renewable  energy  certificates,  energy  efficiency \ncertificates,  electric  vehicle  credits,  and  other  sector-specific  schemes  which  are  further \ncontributing to the emerging new carbon market mechanisms. \n \n4.   International  carbon  markets  are  currently  facing  a  combination  of  challenges  and \nopportunities due to both international and domestic factors. Since mid-2011, carbon markets \nhave  been  facing  reduced  demand  because  of  the  economic  slowdown  in  major  demand \ncenters (mainly the European Union), the oversupply of international offsets, and the uncertainty \nrelating  to  binding  international  climate  agreements. While  the  European  Union  Emissions \nTrading Scheme continues to be the largest trading scheme, a number of other domestic and \nregional carbon markets are emerging, such as the Nusantara Carbon Scheme in Indonesia, \nthe  Thailand  Carbon  Offsetting  Program,  Thailand  Voluntary  Emission  Reduction Program, \nKazakhstan\u2019s Mandatory Emissions Trading Scheme, and the Tokyo Cap-and-Trade Program.  \n \n5.  The proposed TA will help promote green growth in ADB DMCs through supporting the \nuse of carbon financing. The initial focus will be on priority countries in South and Southeast \nAsia such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the Philippines, \nThailand, and Viet Nam, with a possibility to expand to other DMCs based on their need and \navailability of funds. These priority countries have been selected based on their strong interest \nand  ongoing  efforts  in  implementing  new  carbon  market  mechanisms  such  as  bilateral \nmechanisms. These DMCs conveyed their request for ADB\u2019s assistance for accessing carbon \nfinancing through bilateral mechanisms during consultation workshops and interactions with \ntheir government officials. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n6.   The countries of Asia and the Pacific have a key role to play in addressing global climate \nchange issues. Because of rapid economic growth, Asia and the Pacific is becoming a major \nsource of greenhouse gas emissions, largely because of the rapidly increasing demand for \nenergy. The carbon dioxide emissions in Asia and the Pacific region grew by more than 131% \nbetween  1990  and  2010.8 Asia  and  the  Pacific  region\u2019s  share  in  aggregate global  carbon \ndioxide emissions are projected to increase from 42.8% in 2010 to 51.1% by 2035 (footnote 8).  \nIt is clear that decoupling the region\u2019s growth from carbon emissions is pivotal in the global \nefforts to mitigate climate change. \n \n7.  The magnitude of the challenge is daunting, and enormous investment will be required \nto meet the growing needs of developing countries while transitioning to a low-carbon path. \nAccording to ADB, the Asia and the Pacific region will require a cumulative investment of about \n$11.7 trillion (2010\u20132035) in order to meet its business as usual energy demand. The region will \nhowever require enhanced investments of $19.9 trillion (2010\u20132035) to deploy advanced energy \nefficient and low-carbon-emitting technologies (footnote 8). There is a need to mobilize financial \nresources from all possible channels, including carbon market mechanisms. According to a \nWorld Bank report, Mapping Carbon Pricing Initiatives, emerging pricing schemes can make an \nimportant  dent  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Countries  with  implemented  and  scheduled \n                                                \n7 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 April 2014. \n8 ADB. 2013. Energy Outlook for Asia and the Pacific. Manila.  \n ", "  3 \ncarbon pricing mechanisms (in 2013) emit the equivalent of roughly 10 gigatons of carbon \ndioxide per year, equal to about 20% of global emissions.9 \n \n8.  At its 18th session held in 2012, the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP18) \nestablished a timetable for a universal climate change agreement covering all countries from \n2020.10 In addition, COP18 decided to further elaborate a new market-based mechanism under \nthe  UNFCCC,  and  a  work  program  to  develop  a  framework  for  coordinating  mechanisms \nestablished under the UNFCCC and those supporting the implementation of the UNFCCC, such \nas nationally administered or bilateral offset programs. The decisions of COP18 and CMP8 \nindicate that the coexistence of the CDM and emerging mechanisms, and the combination of \ninternational and domestic trading schemes, are increasing the complexity of the carbon market. \nWhile these agreements and decisions allowed carbon markets to continue beyond 2012, they \nsupport the emergence of new carbon market mechanisms. However, ADB\u2019s DMCs will face \ncapacity  constraints  in  meeting  the  increasingly  complex  requirements  of  the  new  carbon \nmarkets, and will therefore need capacity building assistance to take full advantage of the new \nmarket  mechanisms.  Capacity  building  activities  such  as  knowledge  sharing  and  outreach \nevents such as workshops, webinars, and resource exchanges will be very useful.     \n \n9.  New international carbon market mechanisms are also expected to emerge during the \nongoing second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. It is anticipated that these new \ncarbon market mechanisms will include different bilateral arrangements under unique rules \n(\u201cbilateral mechanisms\u201d) and crediting of greenhouse gas emission reductions on a project basis \nor on a whole sector basis (\u201csectoral crediting\u201d or \u201csectoral mechanism\u201d). Without adequate \ntechnical expertise, DMCs will have difficulty appreciating and adapting to the procedures, \nregulations, and other requirements of these new carbon market mechanisms.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n10.    This TA will help DMCs build their institutional capacities to effectively participate in, and \ntake advantage of, bilateral mechanisms such as a joint crediting mechanism. The TA will \ndevelop required methodologies and procedures to assist DMCs in developing country specific \npolicies and guidelines for such new mechanisms. The TA will also help DMCs evaluate the \nsuitability of such bilateral mechanisms in view of their potential contribution to development of \nsustainable global carbon markets. \n \n11.  The TA will build on the success of the previous initiatives of the Technical Support \nFacility  under  the  Carbon  Market  Program.  It  will  continue  to  support  DMCs  and  ADB\u2019s \noperations departments in accessing carbon finance through new carbon market mechanisms, \nespecially from bilateral mechanisms. It may also be noted that in the initial phase of such \nbilateral mechanisms, ADB DMCs will require a substantial amount of support in building their \ncapacity to develop or adapt methodologies for estimating greenhouse gas emission reductions \nand/or monitoring, reporting, and verification requirements under new bilateral mechanisms.  \n \n                                                \n9 World Bank. 2013.

The COP serves as the meeting of the Parties to \nthe  Kyoto  Protocol.  All  Parties  to  the  Convention  are  represented  at  the  COP  at  which  they  review  the \nimplementation of the Convention. The COP meets every year, unless the Parties decide otherwise. All Parties to \nthe Kyoto Protocol are represented at the COP serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP), \nwhile States that are not Parties participate as observers. The CMP reviews the implementation of the Kyoto \nProtocol and takes decisions to promote its effective implementation. The CMP meets annually during the same \nperiod as the COP.  COP18 and CMP8 took place in Doha in Qatar from 26 November to 8 December, 2012. \n ", "4   \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the TA will be  green growth and  low-carbon development promoted \nthrough new carbon market mechanisms in participating DMCs in Asia and the Pacific. The \noutcome will be enhanced capacities of the participating DMCs for increased utilization of new \ncarbon market mechanisms including bilateral mechanisms.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The first output of the TA will be capacity building activities for institutions and local \nexperts on new carbon market mechanisms such as bilateral mechanism. The TA will keep \ntrack  of  developments  on  the  new  carbon  market  mechanisms  including  relevant  tools, \nstandards, and technical guidelines so as to maintain the most updated knowledge on new \ncarbon market mechanisms. It will identify focal institutions of participating DMCs and consult \ntraining needs to implement the new market mechanisms in particular bilateral mechanism, and \ntrain  the  selected  institutional  representatives,  project  developers,  and  local  experts  for \nenhanced access to benefits under such new mechanisms. The main targeted trainees will be \npolicy makers, experts, and business managers of participating DMCs.  \n \n14.  The second output of the TA will be direct project support under new carbon market \nmechanisms through requisite technical support for ADB pipeline projects so as to be eligible \nunder  such  mechanisms.  The  TA  will  scrutinise  ADB  pipeline  of  projects  and  identify  the \npotential eligible projects at an early stage. The TA experts will interact closely with the ADB \nproject officers and project proponents to explore the possibilities of supporting their specific \nprojects under new market mechanism such as bilateral mechanism for a specific ADB pipeline \nproject. An analysis will be presented to the ADB project officers and project proponents to \nshow the merits of joining the mechanism, requirements to be met, and steps to be taken on the \nprocess for the registration of the project under a new carbon market mechanism like bilateral \nmechanism. \n \n15.  The  third  output  of  the  TA  will  be  knowledge  products  on  new  carbon  market \nmechanisms. New market mechanisms are still at developing stage. The policy makers and \nregulators of participating DMCs, technical and methodological experts, third party validators \nand  project  proponents  will  have  to  be  trained  through  strong  back-up  of  knowledge  and \ninformation. The TA experts will develop knowledge products through studying and analyzing \nthe requirements of new carbon market mechanisms, and create a database of information for \nwide sharing in time.  The knowledge products may include policy and technical guidelines of a \ncarbon market mechanism.  \n \n16.  The TA will also have important links and synergies with the ongoing carbon market \ndevelopment TA, Supporting the Use of Carbon Financing to Promote Green Growth in Asia \nand Pacific (footnote 3), and will seek to augment ongoing initiatives by acting as a catalyst for \nthe development of carbon markets. The TA will seek to share knowledge and information with \nexisting non-ADB initiatives both within and outside the UNFCCC framework.  \n   \n17.  The major assumptions and risks are identified in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1). To minimize these risks, under the TA (i) developments in the international and \nregional arenas on climate change actions and project activities will be closely monitored; (ii) a \nflexible project design, including in its governance, will be adopted; (iii) a participatory and \nconsultative approach will be adopted in project planning, design, and implementation to ensure \nstrong  ownership,  and  through  workshops  and  consultations  to  seek  inputs  and  views  of \n ", "  5 \nstakeholders  during  inception,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  TA  activities;  (iv)  where \nnecessary, formal agreements such as memoranda of understanding will be forged to define \nkey responsibilities; and (v) existing networks will be tapped to identify and engage qualified \nexperts for the projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will serve as the executing and implementing agency for the TA, with the Climate \nChange and Disaster Risk Management Unit of the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment serving as the focal point. The initial implementation period of the TA will be from \nJune 2014 to May 2016.   \n \n20.  The TA will require 30 person-months of international and 54 person-months of national \nindividual  consultant  inputs.  Appendix  3  provides  the  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants.  In  order  to  have  specialized  and/or  country-specific  expertise,  individual \nconsultants will be engaged. ADB will engage all consultants in accordance with its Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  procurement  of \nequipment and other supplies will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, \nas amended from time to time). The turnover or disposal of equipment purchased under the TA \nwill be in accordance with the relevant ADB guidelines. Disbursements under the TA will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time).   \n \n21.  ADB will establish a TA team comprising staff from its focal unit and other experts who \nwill monitor TA activities and consultants\u2019 work, provide guidance, and give input and feedback \non  a  regular  basis.  This  unit  will  implement  the  TA  in  close  consultation  with  operations \ndepartments regarding particular areas or sectors requiring assistance. The team will coordinate \nwith  regional  departments  during  implementation  of  the  TA  to  ensure  that  the  work \ncomplements its current and planned efforts to support national climate change priorities. The \nTA team will also work in close coordination with other departments such as the Controller\u2019s \nDepartment, Operations Services and Financial Management Department, Office of Cofinancing \nOperations, and Office of the General Counsel to meet implementation requirements including \nfunds disbursements, utilization, and reporting.  \n   \n22.  The team will also work and coordinate with partner organizations like UNFCCC and the \nInstitute for Global Environmental Strategies. Lessons will be accessible to interested parties, \ninternally and externally, to facilitate and support future capacity building efforts.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Supporting the Use of Carbon \nFinancing from New Carbon Market Mechanisms to Promote Green Growth in Asia and the \nPacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance \nTargets and  Data Sources and \nDesign  Indicators with  Reporting \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact       Assumption \nGreen growth and low- By 2020: 50% of the  Government and  Participating DMCs are \ncarbon development   participating DMCs  public information  committed to green growth \npromoted through new  develop policy  sources such as web  agenda under new carbon \ncarbon market  framework to support  sites of designated  market mechanisms such as \nmechanisms, in  new carbon market  national authorities,  bilateral mechanisms. \nparticipating DMCs.    mechanisms  department of   \n  including bilateral  industries, energy,  Risk \n  mechanisms.
