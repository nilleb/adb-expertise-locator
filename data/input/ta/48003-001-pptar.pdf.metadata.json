The proposed Qingdao Smart Low-Carbon District Energy Project was discussed in the \ncountry programming mission held in Manila on October 2013 as firm 2015. At that time, Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) received only a brief project description which does not contain \nsufficient  information  to  conduct  the  project  appraisal  immediately.  A  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) is required to (i) conduct the due diligence on several aspects of \nthe proposed loan (para. 9, main text), (ii) familiarize the implementing agency with ADB\u2019s \nprocurement  procedure,  disbursement  procedure,  and  environment  and  social  safeguards \nrequirement, and (iii) facilitate learning opportunities in emerging district energy technologies \nand  business  practices.  The  project  team  and  consultants  supported  by  the  implementing \nagency  will  work  up-front  with  the  local  design  institute  to  synchronize  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \nrequirements into the domestic requirements.  \n \nB.

Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n3.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TA special fund-other \n ", "14  Appendix 5 \nsources). The Government will provide the balance for local costs to cover in-kind counterpart \ncosts and services including counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative support \nservices, and local city transport and logistics costs. The detailed cost estimate is in Table A5.2. \nThe government was advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any \nensuing project. \n \nTable A5.2: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($'000) \nTotal \nItem \n   Cost \nAsian Development Bank a    \n1.

Consulting Services \n4.  The TA will take a two stage approach to use consulting services efficiently. Part 1 (data \ngathering  and  preliminary  assessment)  will  require  a  total  of  7.5  person-months  of  one \ninternational and three individual national consultants while Part 2 (detailed assessment) will \nrequire a total of 6 person-months of international and 15 person-months of national consulting \nservices through a consulting firm. Part 1 will be implemented while the selection of consulting \nservices  of  Part  2  is  underway.  Hiring  a  small  number  of  individual  consultants  is  more \nappropriate for the quick mobilization of consulting service and cost-effective than firms to \nperform the assignment of Part 1. The information collected by the consultants of Part 1 will be \ncarried over to the consultants of Part 2. The expected benefit of this approach may advance \nthe loan processing schedule. The required positions and person-months are indicated in Table \nA5.3.  As  for  Part  1,  the  three  individual  national  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). As for Part 2, a consulting firm will be recruited by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants through quality- and cost-based selection method (with a \nquality-cost ratio of 90:10 due to importance of technical aspects) using simplified technical \nproposal.  The  procurement  of  equipment  by  consultants,  under  the  TA,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The equipment procured under the TA will be turned over to the executing \nagency upon TA completion.  \n \nTable A5.3: Summary of Consulting Services Requirements \nInternational  Person- National  Person-months \nmonths \nName of Positions  Name of Positions \nPart 1.          \n1.
