INTRODUCTION  \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  strengthen \ncompetitiveness of Viet Nam\u2019s agriculture sector by supporting enabling conditions for inclusive \nagribusiness development along the value chains of selected commodities. The TA aims to \nenhance competitiveness and sustain inclusive growth in the agriculture sector of Viet Nam in line \nwith the government\u2019s Agriculture Restructuring Plan.1 The TA will undertake assessments and \nbuild  capacity  (mainly  in  provinces)  to  support  a  long-term  programmatic  approach  of \ncommercializing the agriculture sector.2 It is aligned with the country partnership strategy for Viet \nNam, 2016\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) that aims to (i) promote job creation and \ncompetitiveness, (ii) enhance the inclusiveness of infrastructure and service delivery, and (iii) \nimprove environmental sustainability and climate change response. The TA is included in the \ncountry operations business plan for Viet Nam, 2017\u20132019.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since around 1997, Viet Nam has made significant strides in integrating with international \nmarkets in the trade of agricultural commodities. In 2013, the export value of eight agriculture \nproducts exceeded $1 billion per annum, making Viet Nam the world\u2019s largest exporter of cashew \nand pepper, second of coffee, third of rice and rubber, fourth of fishery products, and sixth of tea.4 \nIt has established trade relations with over 160 countries and territories. Also in 2013, the overall \nagriculture trade surplus with 13 export markets exceeded $1 billion and the surplus with three \nexport markets exceeded $10 billion. Export turnover from agro-forestry and fisheries grossed \n$27.5  billion,  accounting  for  around  20%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  export  turnover,  which  is \ncommensurate with the agriculture sector\u2019s share of gross domestic product (GDP) of 18%\u201320%.5  \n \n3.  These achievements were due to substantial investments in irrigation infrastructure and \nin intensifying the factors of production including land, labor, and agricultural inputs (e.g., seed, \nfertilizer), which resulted in the rapid growth of productivity in these commodities throughout the \n1990s. 6 However, the growth of land and labor productivity in agriculture began to taper off in \naround 2000, and growth in the total factor productivity in agriculture has been declining since \nthen.7 The share of public investment in the agriculture sector from the state budget has also \ndeclined from 20.0% of GDP in 1990 to 6.3% of GDP in 2010. Because there has been limited \ninvestment in value addition,8 agriculture value added per worker as a ratio of average income \n                                                           \n1  Government of Viet Nam. 2013.

Growth declined from \n3.8% during 2001\u20132005 to 3.3% during 2006\u20132010 and to 2.7% in 2013. Viet Nam also faces \ngrowing competition in trading agriculture commodities because of concerns over the quality and \nsafety of products. Climate variability also threatens its agriculture sector. For instance, the 2014\u2013\n2016 El Ni\u00f1o effect caused significant losses in agriculture production and in the livelihoods of \nrural farming households. Although the country has plentiful water resources, several regions \nexperience significant seasonal variability. Sixty percent of Viet Nam\u2019s surface water originates \noutside its borders, presenting high risks for water security.  \n \n4.  To  remain  competitive,  the  sector  must  shift  its  focus  from  low-value  agricultural \ncommodities to high-value agro-food products. This requires a strategic reorientation toward \ncommercialization, mainly by promoting private investment in agribusinesses and developing \ninclusive value chains in agricultural products. Several constraints hamper this transition. For \nexample, private sector investment in the agriculture sector is very limited and lags far behind the \nmanufacturing and service sectors.10 There are significant risks associated with investing in \nagriculture  such  as  climate  variability,  disease  outbreaks,  commodity  price  volatility,  and \ngovernance issues. These risks are heightened by the sector\u2019s decreasing factor productivity that \ncan be attributed to resource degradation (e.g., soil, water) and low skill levels. Other reasons \ninclude limited financing opportunities and limited access to markets. Access to markets is \naffected by limited efforts in brand and market development and product differentiation. The lack \nof investment in promoting innovation and adopting technology has caused product differentiation \nto suffer. The poor quality and reliability of agricultural produce and inputs has also deterred \nprivate sector engagement. Smallholders dominate Viet Nam\u2019s agriculture production landscape. \nThis presents significant challenges for aggregation and product differentiation, maintaining \nquality and safety standards, and ensuring the inclusiveness of actors in value chains. Institutional \narrangements (e.g., producer cooperatives) for streamlining aggregation and quality assurance \n(e.g., participatory guarantee systems) need to become mainstreamed for smallholder producers \nto participate and benefit from enhanced agro-food value chains.  \n   \n5.  Public  investment  planning,  policy,  and  regulatory  frameworks  also  further  hamper \ncommercialization of the sector. A disproportionate share of public investment has gone into \nsupporting the agriculture production base (e.g., irrigation systems), whereas there has been \nlimited support to promote post-harvest processing and value addition (e.g., storage, market \nstructures, logistics) or to adopt innovation and technology in agro-food production. Investment in \nrelated sectors (e.g., science and technology, vocational training) has also been limited because \nof the lack of integrated and coordinated strategies to promote agriculture value addition. 11  Viet \nNam has numerous laws and decrees aimed at creating a transparent and fair environment for \ninvestors. However, they are poorly implemented and enforced, creating considerable uncertainty. \nThe planning, policy and regulatory environment must become more open to public\u2013private \ncollaboration arrangements.  \n \n6.  The government recognizes the urgent need to undertake sector reforms to maintain its \ncompetitive edge in external markets and meet the demands of an increasingly discerning \ndomestic market. The agricultural restructuring plan aims to (i) sustain growth and raise efficiency \nand competitiveness by increasing productivity, quality, and value addition to meet domestic and \n                                                           \n9  World Bank. 2016. Vietnam Development Report 2016\u2013Transforming Vietnamese Agriculture: Gaining More from \nLess. Ha Noi.  \n10 In 2014, foreign direct investment in agriculture accounted for slightly over 1% of the total registered capital of foreign \ndirect investment in the country. \n11  Eighty percent of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development\u2019s capital investment funds during 2006\u20132010 \nwere channeled to the irrigation subsector. \n \n ", "3 \ninternational demands; (ii) raise incomes and improve the living standards of rural residents, \nensure food security (including nutrition security) that contributes to poverty reduction; and (iii) \nenhance capacity in disaster risk management.12 The strategy also calls for the agriculture sector \nto become more service oriented and demand driven with the government\u2019s role shifting from \nprimary investor and service provider to facilitator of investments and services by the private \nsector.  \n \n7.  ADB  is  well  placed  to  support  the  country\u2019s  efforts  to  enhance  agriculture \ncommercialization. ADB has helped improve the agriculture production base by investing in rural \ninfrastructure facilities (e.g., irrigation, rural roads, rural water supply) and watershed protection \nto improve soil and water conservation. It has also supported soft interventions such as the \nadoption of good agricultural practices (e.g., traceability mechanisms, sanitary and phytosanitary \nstandards) and agricultural waste management practices through low-carbon solutions (i.e., \nbiogas from livestock waste). More recently, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department has \nsupported Vietnamese private companies to expand their agribusiness investments. At the \nregional scale, support through the Greater Mekong Subregional program has strengthened \nADB\u2019s role in promoting regional cooperation in agriculture. ADB also works closely with other \ndevelopment partners in the sector to address systemic issues such as food quality and safety.  \nPast interventions highlight the need to adopt more integrated and inter-sector approaches to \npromote value chain development by combining investments in productive infrastructure, skills \ndevelopment and technology uptake, financing, and private sector engagement.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: competitiveness enhanced and inclusive \ngrowth sustained in the agriculture sector of Viet Nam (footnote 1). The TA will have the following \noutcome:  enabling  policy,  institutional,  and  investment  conditions  for  agriculture \ncommercialization enhanced in selected provinces. 13  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n9.  Output 1: Public\u2013private collaboration arrangements in agriculture value chains \nestablished. This output will establish public and private collaboration arrangements to promote \nthe  development  of  agriculture  value  chains for  selected commodities.  It  will  also  develop \nfinancing mechanisms for agribusiness development, taking climate risks into consideration.14 \nActivities  will  include  (i)  identifying  commodities  in  which  the  selected  provinces  have  a \ncomparative advantage; (ii) supporting dialogue between public (i.e. provincial agencies) and \nprivate entities (i.e. companies or business associations) to facilitate agribusiness engagements; \n(iii) undertaking value chain assessments, market condition surveys, demand assessments, and \nidentifying technology gaps and opportunities to promote innovation; (iv) identifying gaps in the \ncurrent  access to finance  and  the formulation  of  climate-responsive agribusiness financing \nmechanisms  for  both  investment  and  working  capital;  and  (v)  establishing  collaborative \narrangements for agribusiness development including specifying arrangements between public \n                                                           \n12 Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 339/QD-TTg of 19 February 2013. \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Three provinces\u2014Can Tho, Khanh Hoa, and Thai Binh\u2014\nwere identified based on having (i) strong leadership, vision, and commitment to developing a commercially oriented \nand high-tech agriculture sector; (ii) a comparative advantage as a logistics hub that can support agriculture-based \nvalue chains; (iii) a broad agriculture commodity supply base including from surrounding provinces; (iv) proximity to \ndomestic markets; (v) synergies with other ADB operations; and (vi) capacity and interest in participating in an \nensuing investment loan.  \n14 Where climate risks may be addressed through mechanisms such as risk-adjusted premiums.  \n ", "4 \nand private entities.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Public investment planning and expenditure management for agriculture \ncommercialization strengthened. Activities will build capacity of the public sector to assume \nroles in facilitating agribusiness development as defined under output 1. The output will result in \nagribusiness-related  investments  in  infrastructure,  processing,  post-harvest  distribution,  and \nquality assurance being prioritized for inclusion in provincial medium-term investment plans. It will \nalso adopt a framework to promote innovation and technology adoption within agriculture value \nchains. Activities will include (i) conducting policy and institutional analysis on agribusiness \nenabling conditions, (ii) helping define roles and responsibilities of key public sector institutions in \npromoting innovation and technology adoption in selected agriculture value chains, (iii) developing \na framework to prioritize agribusiness infrastructure and service investments, (iv) building capacity \nto establish an agribusiness perspective in medium-term investment plans and expenditure \nframeworks, and (v) developing provincial agribusiness value chain strategies and action plans.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,980,000, of which $1,800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  Under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, ineligible expenditures include (i) vehicle \npurchases, (ii) salaries for civil servants, (iii) foreign travel, (iv) scholarships or long internships, \n(v) detailed engineering, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) those under ADB\u2019s \nList of Ineligible Items (or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List.15  \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office accommodation, \noffice supplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development will be the executing agency. The \nministry will assign the Institute of Policy and Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development to \nbe the implementing agency. ADB, through the Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture \nDivision of the Southeast Asia Department, will administer and supervise the TA. The Institute of \nPolicy and Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development will set up a project management unit \nand assign a project director and a core team of counterpart staff to work with the TA consultants. \nThe ministry will ensure the coordination of TA activities internally with other departments with a \nmandate to support value chain development and externally with other ministries including the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Industry and Trade, and other line ministries \nwhose mandates have bearing on the TA outcome. The TA will be implemented in close \ncoordination with provincial peoples\u2019 committees of selected provinces. Each provincial peoples\u2019 \ncommittee will establish inter-provincial coordinating arrangements between key provincial line \nagencies (i.e., departments of planning and investment, agriculture and rural development, \nindustry and trade) and with private enterprises interested in agribusiness investments to facilitate \nthe TA activities.16 ADB will consider engaging a third party entity that has experience establishing \npublic\u2013private  collaboration  arrangements  in  agriculture  at  the  inception  phase  to  facilitate \ndialogue with private enterprises. 17 The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table \n1. \n                                                           \n \n15 Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction 2017 Policy Guidelines for Technical Assistance Grant.\n16 Including private companies supported through ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department operations. \n17 Possible partners include IDH the Sustainable Trade Initiative and Grow Asia. \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements\n \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  October 2017\u2013September 2019 \nExecuting agency  MARD \nImplementing agency  IPSARD  \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB  \nIndividual consultant  95 person-months  $1,134,000 \nselection  (international and national) \n  Studies and surveys  TBD  $200,000 \nProcurement  To be procured by the executing agency \nShopping  1 contract  $40,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAn advance payment facility will be established under IPSARD, MARD to \nfacilitate the disbursement of office equipment, workshops, seminars, and a \nportion of miscellaneous administration and support costs. \nAsset turnover or disposal  Upon completion of the TA, the equipment will be turned over to the \narrangement upon TA completion  executing agency. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IPSARD = Institute of Policy and Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development, \nMARD = Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, TA = technical assistance, TBD = to be determined. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n15.
