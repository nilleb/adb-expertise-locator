INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Since 1968, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided a cumulative amount of \n$6.87 billion in assistance to Sri Lanka (as of 31 October 2014), including sovereign loans, \ngrants, and technical assistance (TA). The active loan portfolio includes 43 sovereign loans for \n28 projects with a net loan amount of $2.3 billion with cumulative contract awards of $1.2 billion \nand disbursements of $0.9 billion. The active grant portfolio includes six grants amounting to \n$51.92 million and the active TA portfolio includes 18 projects amounting to $17.46 million. The \ntransport, urban, water, and energy sectors constitute 75% of the current portfolio. ADB\u2019s Sri \nLanka Resident Mission has conducted annual tripartite portfolio review missions (TPRMs) and \ncountry  portfolio  review  missions  (CPRMs)  together  with  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  to \nimprove portfolio performance by identifying systemic and project-specific issues in the portfolio \nand formulating time-bound action plans to address those problems. \n \n2.  These issues have been addressed through portfolio reviews and project-specific TA. \nHowever, as some issues still remain unresolved, there is a need for a comprehensive TA \nproject that addresses crosscutting issues with a mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of \ncapacity  development  programs.  This  project  is  needed  to  sustain  the  outcome  of  these \ninterventions that cut across projects and cover the entire project cycle. The External Resources \nDepartment and the Department of Project Management and Monitoring (DPMM) of the Ministry \nof  Finance  and  Planning  (MOFP)  have  requested  on  various  occasions,  including  during \nTPRMs and CPRMs, that ADB conduct capacity development programs to enhance project \nimplementation  and  management  capacity  of  executing  agencies  and  to  improve  project \nreadiness  at  entry.  In  response,  a  new  TA  project  was  included  in  ADB\u2019s  draft  country \noperations business plan, 2015 - 2017.1 Following a discussion with the External Resources \nDepartment, a consensus was reached on the purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, \ncosts, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants of the TA. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  From 2009 to 2013, there has been an improvement in the portfolio performance with an \nannual average of $280 million in contract awards and $307 million in disbursements. However, \nsome unresolved matters need to be addressed.  \n \n4.  Delays have been experienced in awarding the first contract after loan approval for the \nGreater Colombo Wastewater Management Project (22 months) and the Jaffna and Kilinochchi \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project  (15  months),3 mainly  because  of  the  lack  of  project \nreadiness  to  meet  ADB  requirements  governing  procurement,  selection  of  consultants, \ndisbursement,  and  safeguard  requirements.  The  performance  of  the  transport  sector  is \ncomparatively better as on average it has taken 8 months or less for active loans to award the \nfirst contract after loan approval and there is an enhanced focus on completing the detailed \nengineering designs and land acquisition requirements prior to contract awards.  \n \n                                                \n1  The Draft Country Operations Business Plan 2015 - 2017 will be circulated in January 2015. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 November 2014. \n3  ADB. 2009.

Manila; and \nADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Water \nSupply and Sanitation Project. Manila. \n ", "2  \n5.  The time taken to reach 20% in disbursements from loan approval for active loans as of \n31 December 2013 was 30.5 months for Sri Lanka (compared to 28 months for India). Therefore, \nproject readiness at approval will need to be improved by emphasizing the completion of (i) the \ndetailed  engineering  design,  (ii)  the  bidding  process  at  least  up  to  evaluation  stage  for \nengagement of supervision consultants and contractors, (iii) the necessary actions to ensure \nsafeguard readiness, and (iv) all other government approvals and clearances related to funding \nand institutional arrangements.   \n \n6.    Some  projects  in  the  portfolio  may  face  complex  challenges  that  need  complete \nrestructuring and reformulation during project implementation. This may be due to high cost \noverruns or fundamental assumptions that no longer  hold true (e.g., the designated water \nsource may no longer be available during project implementation for a water supply project). \nThe TA will provide specialized inputs and skills as most of the executing and implementing \nagencies lack the capacity to address these complex challenges when a project needs rapid \nrestructuring. \n \n7.  Weak project implementation and management capacity of executing and implementing \nagencies has been a continuous challenge for improved portfolio performance. Agency staff \nmembers  take  a  minimum  of  1  year  to  familiarize  themselves  with  the  project  and  ADB \nguidelines. Strengthening capacities in improving procurement, project management, contract \nmanagement, and financial management are imperative to improve portfolio performance in Sri \nLanka. Number of days from the invitation for bids to the awarding of civil works contracts in \n2013  averaged  118  days  for  national  competitive  bidding  and  266  days  for  international \ncompetitive bidding, compared to the required time of 107 days for national competitive bidding \nand 165 days for international competitive bidding. In 2013, 28% of the withdrawal applications \nwere referred back to the executing agencies because they were incomplete.  \n \n8.  Inadequate capacity of executing agency staff in project performance monitoring and \nevaluation was noted in all TPRMs. Not having a proper monitoring system results in ad hoc \nreporting  and  limited  capacity  to  respond  to  emerging  implementation  issues.  DPMM  is \nmandated to undertake overall monitoring and evaluation of the entire Sri Lanka portfolio. \nHowever, it needs continuous support to enhance skills and competencies of staff and upgrade \nits information technology. The TA will provide necessary technical support to address these \nissues.  \n \n9.  Resettlement and land acquisition are complex issues that often cause significant delays. \nAdvance action is encouraged for future projects to ensure that required land is handed over to \nthe contractor immediately after the contract is awarded, before the start of any civil works. \nThrough TA support, these readiness filters will be strengthened to ensure early action on land \nacquisition and resettlement activities and compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).  This  will  be  further  promoted  through  knowledge  sharing  on  best  practices  and \ninnovations across sectors. The present arrangements for TPRMs do not facilitate knowledge \nsharing  as  individual  projects  are  reviewed  with  the  relevant  executing  and  implementing \nagencies  only.  Therefore,  the  TA  will  be  designed  to  facilitate  knowledge  sharing  events \ncombined with portfolio review meetings as practiced in India to ensure learning across sectors.  \n \n10.  The content of audited project accounts (APAs) has significantly improved since 2009; \nhowever, delays were encountered in the submission of APAs and audited financial statements. \nDuring 2013, 27 APAs were due for submission and no report was received by the due date. \nThe delay in the submission of financial statements from the project management units to the \nAuditor General\u2019s Department is a major issue (4.92 months compared to 3 months standard). \n ", "  3\nThe financial management staff member assigned to PMUs require adequate training and \nsupport to comply with the fiduciary requirements associated with the projects.   \n \n11.  The  need to systematically address challenges in the portfolio are  further emphasized \nin the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, approved on 23 April 2014, which includes streamlining \nbusiness processes to strengthen ADB\u2019s development effectiveness and delivering value for \nmoney. 4 The  review  calls  for  adoption  of  realistic  project  implementation  schedules  using \nproject  readiness  filters,  and  to  reduce  delays  in  project  implementation  and  minimize \ntransactions costs for clients. While ADB is streamlining its business processes, it will only \nachieve its intended objective if, at the same time, the executing and implementing agencies are \nalso strengthened, and this will be addressed by the TA. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact will be enhanced operational effectiveness of ADB projects in Sri Lanka. The \noutcome will be improved portfolio performance in Sri Lanka. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will have three outputs. \n \n14.  Output 1: Project implementation and management capacity of executing agency \nand implementing agency staff strengthened. Through a series of training programs, hands-\non  support  measures,  and  knowledge  sharing  initiatives  the  TA  will  lead  to  improved \nimplementation  results,  including  the  highest  level  of  readiness  during  the  key  stages  of \nimplementation.  The  focus  will  be  on  enhancing  procurement  capacity  and  contract \nmanagement, fiduciary requirements and safeguard processes, and monitoring. Since efficient \nand  effective  procurement  is  closely  linked  with  having  sound  financial  management \narrangements in place, including accounting, financial reporting, and internal controls, the TA \nscope will include support to participating agencies and supporting central agencies such as the \nMinistry of Finance and supreme audit institutions, where relevant. A capacity development \nresource center (CDRC), in close coordination with ADB\u2019s South Asia Department, will be \nestablished. It will be housed within ADB\u2019s Sri Lanka Resident Mission.  A survey will be \nundertaken  initially  to  identify  the  capacity  development  needs  prior  to  commencement  of \ntraining  activities.  Key  national  academic  institutions  will  be  identified  to  conduct  training \nprograms, and the institutions will charge executing agencies fees for these training programs. \nADB, in consultation with the MOFP, will encourage executing agencies to pay a portion of \nthese fees from the training allocations under their loans, as this will improve the long-term \nsustainability of the capacity building programs. A 3-year capacity development program will be \ndeveloped and updated annually. \n \n15.  Output  2:  Project  and  portfolio  monitoring  capacity  of  executing  agency, \nimplementing agency, and the Ministry of Finance and Planning strengthened. In addition \nto regular TPRMs and CPRMs, a series of workshops and on-site trainings will be organized to \nstreamline the current monitoring framework within the DPMM. A web-based monitoring system \nwill  be  developed  for  implementing  and  executing  agencies  to  track  the  progress  and \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n ", "4  \nperformance of ADB assisted projects in Sri Lanka. Other knowledge sharing and information-\ntechnology-related initiatives will also be supported to facilitate capacity building. \n \n16.  Output  3:  Project  readiness  and  performance  improved.  The  TA  will  assist  in \nsupporting selected executing agencies, implementing agencies, and project management units, \nespecially in the water supply and energy sectors, to complete detailed designs, advance action \nfor procurement, and safeguard requirements through providing necessary technical support to \navoid  initial  start-up  delays.  The  TA  inputs  will  also  be  utilized  to  address  issues  facing \nunderperforming projects and projects requiring reformulation or additional financing as the \nneed may arise. Inputs will be deployed promptly to resolve such matters, and resources will be \nutilized  as  needed  to  complete  ADB  requirements,  including  updating  design  and \nimplementation documents. Therefore, the TA will act as a rapid response facility to restructure \nat-risk projects and potential problematic projects to enhance portfolio performance. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($500,000 from TASF-V and $500,000 from \nTASF-other sources). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office \nspace,  counterpart  staff,  facilities,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The Executing Agency for this TA will be the Ministry of Finance and Planning. The TA \nwill be executed in coordination with the Sri Lanka Resident Mission of ADB\u2019s South Asia \nDepartment. A CDRC will be established in the resident mission, and training programs will be \norganized and implemented through it. The TA will commence in December 2014 and be \ncompleted in December 2018. \n \n19.  The beneficiaries of the TA will be the Ministry of Finance and Planning; Department of \nProject  Management  and  Monitoring;  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board;  Ceylon \nElectricity Board; Road Development Authority; Ministry of Education; Ministry of Youth Affairs \nand  Skills  Development;  Ministry  of  Highways,  Ports  and  Shipping;  Ministry  of  Local \nGovernment and Provincial Council; Ministry of Defense and Urban Development; Ministry of \nPower and Energy; and Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resource Management. Individual \nconsultants and/or a firm will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and implemented over 24 months. The \noutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA will be implemented in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Equipment will be procured for TA implementation in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Upon TA completion, the assets \nwill be turned over to relevant government agencies. \n \n20.  The TA will require about 15 person-months of international consulting services and 44 \nperson-months of national consulting services to cover the TA outputs. The team of experts will \nbe  recruited  on  an  intermittent  basis  and  will  initially  comprise  a  capacity  development \nconsultant,  procurement  specialist,  environment  specialist,  social  safeguard  specialist, \ndesalination expert, legal and governance specialist, financial management specialist, project \nperformance monitoring specialist, and information system development expert. The resource \n ", "  5\npersons and any additional experts required to undertake the capacity development activities \nwill be identified following the detailed needs assessment. \n \n21.  A review of the TA will be undertaken after 6 months of implementation to assess the \nprogress, fine-tune the outputs, and make necessary adjustments, if any, to the key activities \nand implementation arrangements. Impact assessments of the training programs conducted for \nindividuals  will  be  undertaken  annually.  Good  practices  and  lessons  will  be  disseminated \nthrough seminars in ADB, a national workshop, knowledge products, and outputs available on \nthe ADB website, as applicable. \n \n22.  An annual capacity development report will be prepared to document the improvement in \nthe portfolio, the training programs conducted, feedback from participants, best practices, and \nsector  and  thematic  knowledge.  The  report  will  be  published  and  disseminated  to  all \nstakeholders. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Sri Lanka for Improving Project Readiness and Portfolio Management, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact  By end of 2020:   ADB eOperations data  Risk \nEnhanced operational  At least 90% of ongoing  Executing agencies do not \neffectiveness of ADB  projects in Sri Lanka are on  provide sufficient \nprojects in Sri Lanka  track  resources for effective \n(2013 baseline: 80%)  monitoring and evaluation \nprocesses \nOutcome  By end of 2018:  ADB eOperations data  Risk \nImproved portfolio  Disbursement ratio increased    Weak executing agency \nperformance of Sri  to 25% by 2017 (2013  ADB operations dashboard  commitment in achieving \nLanka  baseline: 20%)    portfolio results \nContract awards ratio  ADB annual portfolio \nincreased to 25% by 2017  performance review \n \n(2013 baseline: 20%) \nOutputs:      Assumption \n1.
