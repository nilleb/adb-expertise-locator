INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Poverty Reduction Strategy, Long-Term Strategic \nFramework (2001\u20132015), and Medium-Term Strategy (2001\u20132005) promote the integration of \nsound  environmental  management  into  development  planning  processes  and  require \nenvironmental concerns to be integrated into all ADB operations. ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002)1 specifies the country environmental analysis (CEA) as the tool that may help assist early \nincorporation of environmental considerations into the country strategy and program (CSP). This \nregional technical assistance (TA)2 will develop the CEA for selected Pacific developing member \ncountries (PDMCs), including Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Kiribati, \nPapua New Guinea (PNG), Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI) Samoa, Solomon Islands, and \nVanuatu.3 TA fact-finding missions were undertaken in FSM from 21 to 29 June 2004, and in \nPNG  from  12  to  15  July  2004,  to  discuss  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  and  implementation \narrangements with representatives of key government agencies and other stakeholders. The \ngovernments of all selected PDMCs referred to above have endorsed the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  state  of  the  region\u2019s  environment  has  been  assessed  over  the  past  decade.4 \nSummaries of environmental trends and conditions have been included in reports of the United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP) on the Asia-\nPacific State of the Environment, and in the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) \nGlobal  Environment  Outlook.5  In  1990\u20131993,  ADB,  in  cooperation  with  the  South  Pacific \nRegional Environment Programme (SPREP), provided TA to prepare National Environmental \nManagement  Strategies  (NEMSs)  for  five  PDMCs  (Cook  Islands,  Solomon  Islands,  FSM, \nTonga, and RMI). Later, UNDP funded a similar project for other Pacific countries.  \n3.  In a recently published Pacific Region Environmental Strategy (PRES)6\u2014the output of a \nregional environmental analysis\u2014eight environmental challenges were identified as being of \nhighest priority: (i) threats to freshwater resources, (ii) degradation of the marine and coastal \nenvironment,  (iii)  degradation  of  land  and  forest,  (iv)  problems  of  urbanization  and  waste \nmanagement, (v) depletion of biodiversity, (vi) concern on energy use, (vii) adaptation to climate \nchange, and (viii) weaknesses in environmental management capacities and governance.  \n4.  Freshwater Resources. The freshwater protection and conservation are crucial, and \nwill take on even greater significance as global climate change results in more variable rainfall \nand rising sea levels. Water management regimes are often hampered by weak supporting \nlegislation,  problems  of  cost  recovery,  insufficient  technical  capacity,  and  problems  of \nlandownership  and  water  rights.  To  address  these  issues,  several  initiatives  have  been \nformulated; one was the Regional Action Plan for Sustainable Water Management, approved \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "2  \nduring the High-Level Session of the Pacific Regional Consultation on Water in Small Island \nCountries.7  \n5.  Marine and Coastal Environment. Coral reefs, mangrove forests, sea-grass beds, and \nother coastal and marine ecosystems form the ecological foundation of Pacific economies and \ncontribute significantly to income, health, nutrition, coastal protection, and the tourism industry. \nHowever, these resources are increasingly at risk from discharges of nutrients; changes in sea \ntemperature; improper solid waste disposal; sediment discharge; destruction of fringing reefs, \nbeaches,  wetlands,  and  mangroves  for  coastal  development  and  sand  extraction;  and \noverexploitation of coastal fisheries. Regionally, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community leads \nin managing and regulating marine and coastal resources. UNDP has supported the 5-year \nStrategic Action Program for the International Waters of the Pacific Small Island Developing \nStates.  \n6.  Land and Forest. The forest cover varies across the region\u2014from 40\u201390% in the high \nislands to 5\u201340% for lower islands and atolls\u2014but is now greatly reduced. Forest degradation \nand  deforestation  have  been  major  environmental  problems  in  Pacific  countries.  Habitat \ndestruction, biodiversity degradation, soil loss, reduced water quality, and sedimentation of \nlagoon areas harm the livelihoods of the rural majority and the poorest islanders. The Regional \nForestry Program was established in January 2000 to provide opportunities for collaboration, \ncoordination, and implementation of projects and related initiatives on forest management.  \n7.  Urbanization and Waste Management. Rising problems of waste disposal and urban \npollution  management  are  common  to  most  PDMCs.  The  contamination  of  surface-  and \ngroundwater resources from sewage and household garbage significantly lowers freshwater \nquality. The region has not yet come up with strategies or responses, except for wastewater \nmanagement; a regional meeting held in Majuro, RMI, formulated a Pacific Wastewater Policy \nStatement and the associated Pacific Wastewater Framework for Action on 15 October 2001. \nThese  documents  set  out  the  guiding  principles  and  policies  to  direct  development  and \ncooperation on wastewater management and sanitation among Pacific nations. \n8.  Biodiversity Conservation. The Pacific region is recognized as a globally significant \narea of biological diversity. The Regional Action Strategy for Nature Conservation (2003\u20132007) \nidentifies  six  challenges:  shortcomings  in  institutional  capacity,  infrastructure  development, \ncoordination and integration of environment and conservation activities, economic alternatives \nto  unsustainable  exploitation,  political  support  and  good  governance,  and  limited  funding. \nConsiderable efforts were undertaken in biodiversity conservation, e.g., the parks and protected \narea system management have expanded and conservation planning activities accelerated.  \n9.  Energy. Adequate and affordable energy supplies are a prerequisite for expanding \neducation, health services, and communications. About 70% of the region\u2019s population has no \nelectricity. The Pacific Energy Policy and Plan aims to coordinate regional energy programs and \nto guide adaptation to the special needs of Pacific island countries and territories. Several \nregional energy-related programs involve countries in the Pacific.8 The most recent is ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \n7  Attended by ministers, senior representatives of governments, multilateral and bilateral agencies, civil society \n(including nongovernment and community-based organizations), and the private sector. Fiji Islands, 3 August 2002.  \n8   The Pacific Islands Renewable Energy Project, funded by UNDP-Global Environment Facility for $840,000 covers \n14 countries, started in August 2002 for 18 months. The Pacific Rural Renewable Energy France-Australia \nCommon Endeavor, jointly funded by France and Australia for $1.5 million, implemented by The Secretariat of the \nPacific Community started in 2000 for 3 years. Promoting Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Green \nHouse Gas Abatement is cofinanced by ADB and the Government of the Netherlands, and Samoa is the only \nPDMC participant. ", "    3\nRenewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Program for the Pacific,9 which aims to disseminate \ninformation on renewable energy sources and improved energy-efficient practices.  \n10.  Climate Change. The adverse impacts of climatic change and variability are receiving \nurgent attention among PDMCs. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reconfirmed \nthe threat to small island developing countries from climatic change and variability. The panel \nidentified coral reefs, atolls, and mangroves as most vulnerable to climate change. The concern \nover climate change and sea-level rise reached its peak in October 2000, when the Forum \nLeaders endorsed the Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate Change, Variability, and \nSea-Level Rise. Several projects10 address the impact of climate change and it was concluded \nthat adaptation to climate change must be mainstreamed into governments\u2019 planning, programs, \nand projects, and resources mobilized to do so.  \n11.  Environment Governance. The SPREP has been prominent in formulating Pacific-wide \nenvironmental  agreements.  At  the  national  level,  institutional  arrangements  and  legislative \nframeworks are in place, but law enforcement is inconsistent. NEMSs still provide the principal \nbaseline and blueprint for developing environmental policies and plans. While endorsed by \ngovernment agencies, NEMSs\u2019 implementation is still weak due to limited financial, technical, \nand institutional capacity that leads to inconsistent integration of environment and economic \npolicies and plans. In the past decade, not much progress has been made, either in national \ninstitutional capacity or impact on environmental quality.  \n12.  The ADB Pacific Strategy 2005-2009 highlights the increasing environmental challenges \nthat may undermine sustainable development, particularly the eight critical environmental issues \nindicated by the PRES. Overcoming these constraints will facilitate the sustainable use of \nnatural  resources  and  improve  job  and  cash-generating  opportunities  for  the  poor. \nEnvironmental aspects are included as a PRES key result area, highlighting the mainstreaming \nof environmental considerations into development planning and program.  \n13.  PDMC governments are aware of environmental problems, and realize that the key \nconstraints on effective environmental management are particularly in the legal framework and \nregulatory systems. Aside from that, the linkages among finance, planning, and environmental \nagencies need to be strengthened to ensure that environmental management is incorporated \ninto development plans and receives adequate funding. As part of CSP preparation, the CEA \nwill  provide  country-level  diagnostic  environmental  analysis  and  recommend  key  areas  of \nintervention.  The  CEA  will  be  the  basis  for  ADB  assistance  to  the  selected  PDMCs  to \nmainstream environmental considerations into economic and development planning.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The TA will prepare CEAs that will provide inputs to CSP and CSP updates (CSPUs) for \nselected PDMCs and countries\u2019 medium term development strategy, particularly in addressing \neight  key  environmental  challenges.  The  TA\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  mainstream  key \nenvironmental concerns into economic and development planning processes and to help reduce \npoverty in PDMCs. The TA will (i) identify priority areas in policy, institutional and legislative \n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2003.

The framework summarizing the TA goals, objectives, scope, and performance targets is \nin Appendix 1. \n \n15.  The CEAs will cover (i) the general environment status and trends in the country; (ii) the \npolicy, legislative, institutional, and budgetary framework for environmental management, and \nprincipal constraints on and barriers to improved environmental management in sectors relevant \nto ADB operations; and (iii) the main environmental opportunities and issues associated with the \nCSP and CSPUs,11 including recommended priority actions and programs at the country level \n(TA  and  lending  program  and/or  incorporation  of  environmental  considerations  in \nprograms/projects). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will be implemented in a participatory manner, i.e., involve key government \nofficials and other stakeholders (local experts, private sector, nongovernment organizations, and \ncommunities)  in  key  stages  of  CEA  preparation  to  ensure  ownership  of  the  reports. \nRepresentative of multilateral and bilateral financial institutions and regional institutions will also \nbe consulted. Relevant documents and information will be compiled, reviewed, and analyzed, \ntaking  into  consideration  stakeholders\u2019  views.  A  stakeholder  workshop  will  be  held  in \nparticipating PDMCs to (i) review the findings presented in draft CEAs and validate them; and \n(ii)  seek  consensus  on  the  priority  areas  for  intervention,  particularly  in  mainstreaming \nenvironmental concerns in economic and development planning processes.  \n \n17.  The  main  activities  are  (i)  compilation,  review,  and  analysis  of  basic  information, \nincluding national strategic development plans, state of environments, regional and country \nenvironmental action programs including evaluate the 2003-2007 Action Strategy for Nature \nConservation  in  the  Pacific,  key  environmental  and  sustainability  indicators,  and  links  of \nenvironmental quality with economic growth and poverty reduction; (ii) review of existing policy, \nlegislative,  institutional,  and  budgetary  frameworks  for  environmental  management,  and \nassessment  of  their  coordination  and  effectiveness;  (iii)  identification  of  the  environmental \nimplications  of  key  development,  macroeconomic,  and  sectoral  policies  that  may  have \nsignificant environmental implications, and analysis of environmental performance of the main \neconomic sectors; (iv) review of the effectiveness of past and present environmental programs \nof  ADB  and  other  financial  institutions;  and  (v)  recommendations  on  priority  actions  and \nprograms for ADB (and potential partners) to strengthen environmental management as an \nintegral part of national economic development planning.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The cost estimate and financing plan is attached as \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n11  This will include review of, and inputs to, CSP and CSPUs to mainstream environmental concerns into economic \nand development planning. ", "    5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will be administered by ADB\u2019s Pacific Department. The selected PDMCs will be \ninvolved in TA implementation, which will be closely coordinated with the national governments, \nspecifically with ministries or agencies mandated to carry out economic development planning in \ncoordination with other agencies. The agencies will help ADB consultants gather and compile \ndata, information, and maps, and coordinate TA implementation (including organizing meetings \nand  dialogue  with  government  officials  and  other  stakeholders).  The  department  will  work \nclosely  with  the  consultants  in  reviewing  draft  CEA  reports,  participating  in  consultation \nworkshops, finalizing CEAs, and discussing CEAs with key stakeholders through CSP and \nCSPU missions as necessary.  \n \n20.  The TA will require 15 person-months of international consultants (three individuals); 12 \nperson-months of domestic consultants (one in each country) and 7 person-months of a local \nconsultant (assistant TA coordinator, based at ADB headquarters). The consultants will be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in \nenvironmental  management  and  natural  resource  economics,  and  experience  in \ninstitution/capacity building. The TA will take 11 months, from mid-January to mid-December \n2005. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3, the outline of the CEA \nreports in Appendix 4, and the CEA preparation timetable in Appendix 4, Table A4. \n \n21.  The consultants will submit a work plan by the end of the first week of their services, a \ndraft CEA report 1 week before the country workshop, a revised draft CEA final report after the \nnational stakeholders\u2019 workshop, and a final CEA report at the end of the consultants\u2019 services.  \n \n \nIV.
