The technical assistance (TA) will support the Government of Uttarakhand in implementing \nthe Uttarakhand Integrated and Resilient Urban Development Project, which has the following \nimpacts: (i) universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water; and (ii) access \nto adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, ending open defecation. The project's \noutcome will be that the reliability and efficiency of water supply and sanitation services in \nDehradun and Nainital have been enhanced. The four outputs are: (i) resilient water supply \nsystem and service in Dehradun improved; (ii) integrated and resilient sanitation systems and \ndrainage enhanced in Dehradun and Nainital; (iii) computerized maintenance and management \nsystems for water and sanitation developed and implemented in Dehradun and Nainital; and \n(iv) institutional  capacity  and  knowledge  strengthened.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost \n$156.25 million, of which $125 million will be financed from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The ensuing loan and this transactional TA are listed in the \ncountry operations business plan, 2021\u20132023 for India.1 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The state of Uttarakhand in northern India is part of the central Himalayas, and most of its \nupper areas comprise high mountain ranges and glaciers, while its lower reaches are covered by \ndense forests. The topography ranges from plains and foothills to snow-clad peaks, featuring \nalmost all major climatic zones. Uttarakhand is extremely vulnerable to climate-related and natural \nhazards such as glacier outburst floods, avalanches, snow burst, heavy monsoon-led floods, \nlandslides, and earthquakes The numerous glaciers in the state provide perennial water to the \ndownstream rivers, including Ganga and Yamuna, which provide water to large parts of the \ncountry, and to Bangladesh. Despite these abundant water sources, water shortage has become \na  serious  concern  because  of  insufficient  water  retention  and  detention  capacity.  Besides \ndevelopment activities without sufficient sanitation infrastructure and services, the increasing \npollution of both surface water and groundwater leads to more stress on water availability, while \nthreatening the ecosystem, people\u2019s health and their livelihoods, and Uttarakhand\u2019s sustainable \nand prosperous growth.  \n \n3.  The proposed project focuses on meeting the immediate and urgent need for water supply \nand sanitation infrastructure and services in two highly important and fast-growing cities of \nUttarakhand: Dehradun and Nainital. Along with industrial development and growing tourism, \nmajor urban centers are prospering and employment opportunities have increased. On the other \nhand, more frequent and intensified climate-related and natural hazards in Uttarakhand have \nendangered agricultural activities in upland areas, leaving villagers with no choice but to abandon \ntheir farms or homes and look for other means of livelihood in towns and cities. Popular urban \ncenters, however, neglected to undertake robust urban planning to accommodate these large \nnumbers of migrants, and also found it difficult to mobilize sufficient resources quickly enough to \nprovide basic, resilient, and inclusive infrastructure and public services for all. The migrants ended \nup occupying peri-urban areas where basic infrastructure and services are lacking. They also \nencroached on riverbanks, obstructed the natural draining function of rivers, and polluted rivers \nand groundwater by discharging untreated wastewater. Uncontrolled urban settlements along the \nrivers not only contributed to floods but also became victims of floods. The deteriorating conditions \nhave made the sprawling urban areas more vulnerable to any kinds of shock, both climate and \n \n1 ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2021\u20132023. Manila. \n \n ", "2 \nhuman induced and including the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This poses a disproportionate \nburden on the poor, estimated at about 15% of the population. \n \n4.  During the project's preparation, Uttarakhand not only had to deal with all the human and \neconomic losses from COVID-19 but in February 2021 also experienced one of the most \ndevastating climate change-induced avalanches in the state's history, which dropped 27 million \ncubic meters of rocks and glacier ice on the Chamoli district. The disaster left more than \n200 people dead or missing and destroyed two major hydropower plants and a bridge that \nconnected 13 hill villages. Scientists have warned that the frequency and intensity of glacier burst, \nand other types of climate-induced events, would increase and lead to significant damage in the \nvulnerable  Himalaya  areas,  where  energy  and  road  development  projects  exacerbate  the \nlandslide risk. They strongly recommended to consider the greater magnitude of climate-induced \nrisks before building further infrastructure. Facing these continuous challenges, the Government \nof Uttarakhand recognized the urgent need to tackle the complex issues of climate change, water \nscarcity, water pollution, and associated vulnerabilities. To help it find solutions that would \nimprove climate resilience and ensure the sustainable and prosperous growth of Uttarakhand, the \nstate government requested ADB\u2019s support.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n5.  Responding to the request, the TA will support the state government in strategic climate \nresilience planning and development actions that focus on the urban local bodies (ULBs) of \nDehradun and Nainital and their catchment areas. A participatory approach to climate resilience \nplanning is essential given the nature and complexity of climate change risks and vulnerabilities, \nwhich expose all sectors and their infrastructure and services. Climate resilience planning can be \nonly  meaningful  when  it  is  supported  by  science-based  knowledge  and  evidence-based \ninformation to better understand the magnitude of potential risks in the unknown future of climate \nchange. The advancement of smart technology can make climate resilience planning easier by \ntranslating the range of sophisticated scientific data and information into workable formats that \nusers with simple training can understand and operate.  \n \n6.  Output 1: Comprehensive situation assessment and analyses in Dehradun and \nNainital  watersheds  carried  out.  Detailed  situation  assessments  and  analyses  are  a \nprerequisite for good planning. The TA team will assess (i) socioeconomic and infrastructure \nsystems in light of climate change risks and vulnerability; (ii) natural resources system, including \nwater resources and water quality; and (iii) institutional and governance system. All systems are \nembedded  in  their  environment.  The  natural  resources  system  is  bound  by  climate  and \n(geo)physical conditions. The socioeconomic system is formed by the demographic, social, and \neconomic conditions of the surrounding economies. The institutional and governance system is \nformed and bound by constitutional, legal, and political systems. These systems are closely \ninterlinked  and  relevant  to  the  vulnerabilities  in  Uttarakhand.  The  assessments  will  be \ncomplemented with integrated modeling work that can analyze and interpret results under various \naspects, such as surface water and groundwater discharge, snow melting, landslides, emissions \ndispersion.  This  can  provide  further  science-based  information  and  knowledge  to  translate \ncomplex systems and associated problems into convincing evidence.  \n \n7.  Output 2: Interactive, map-based climate adaptation support tool developed and \noperational. The climate adaptation support tool (CAST) is a touch-table-based platform that will \nstore the results of comprehensive situation assessments and analyses (output 1) and have built-\nin (i) climate resilience measures with short explanations and engineering features, including \necosystem-based adaptation measures; (ii) the likely costs associated with adaptation measures; \n \n ", "3 \nand (iii) quantifiable information on the likely improvement of resilience parameters, such as water \nretention, detention, and storage capacity. By using CAST, planning participants can select and \ncompare various adaptation options, i.e., propose specific interventions, situate them in their \ndefined project areas, and immediately see an estimated resilience capacity improvement as well \nas the associated costs. CAST will provide quantitative, evidence-based performance information \non the (cost) effectiveness of adaptation measures regarding climate resilience and co-benefits. \nThe smart technology-based platform can be updated at any time with new data and information \nand thus enables adaptive resilience planning.   \n \n8.  Output 3: Strategy framework for integrated, climate-resilient development and \nwater resource management formulated. The activities under outputs 1 and 2 will inform the \nformulation of a strategy framework that guides integrated, climate-resilient development and \ncatchment-level water resource management in Uttarakhand. It will define the strategic direction \nand methods to respond to the unique climate change risks and vulnerabilities of the Himalayan \nregion while balancing the demands for growth.  \n \n9.  Output  4:  Knowledge  and  capacity  for  climate  resilience  planning  enhanced. \nThrough a participatory approach, the TA team will design and conduct a series of capacity-\nbuilding  activities,  including  training  and  workshops  on  climate-resilient  planning  and \ndevelopment,  climate-resilient  management  of  water  resources  at  watershed  level,  and \ninfrastructure development in Uttarakhand.   \n \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nMajor Outputs  Delivery Dates  Key Activities with Milestones \n1.
