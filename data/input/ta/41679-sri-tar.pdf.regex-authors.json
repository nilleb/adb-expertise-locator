At the request of the Government of Sri Lanka, the 2007 Country Programming Mission \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) made a provision for an advisory technical assistance \n(TA) to support institutional development assistance to the country\u2019s water supply and sanitation \nsector.1 ADB\u2019s TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Sri Lanka during 22\u201330 November 2007 and \nreached a preliminary understanding with the Government on the TA\u2019s goals, purpose, scope, \nimplementation, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Millions of people in Sri Lanka do not have access to adequate water supply and \nsanitation.  The  goals  of  the  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB)  are  to  \n(i) provide piped supply coverage for 40% of the population by 2011, (ii) ensure access to a safe \nwater supply for 85% of the population by 2015; and (iii) provide piped sewerage coverage for \n3% of the population by 2011.3 The Government\u2019s sector strategy and associated investment \nprogram focus on (i) providing support to rural and more deprived areas; (ii) investing through all \nthree  tiers  of  government  mandated  to  provide  water  and  sanitation\u2014central  government, \nprovincial councils, and local authorities; (iii) establishing adequate regulatory and institutional \nframeworks;  (iv)  improving  performance  and  reducing  nonrevenue  water;  (v)  pursuing \ncommunity-driven  schemes  in  rural  areas,  with  special  attention  to  women\u2019s  participation;  \n(vi) applying integrated urban water supply and management principles; and (vii) ensuring \nenvironmental integrity. In addition, the Government\u2019s strategy clearly identifies the importance \nof sustainability and the need to secure adequate (yet socially acceptable) tariffs for water \nsupply and sewerage schemes. Institutional strengthening is vital to achieving these targets. \n \n3.  Institutional  Arrangements  for  the  Water  Sector.  The  central  Government  is \nresponsible  for  sector  policy,  regulation,  and  development  (Ministry  of  Water  Supply  and \nDrainage, MWSD, and Ministry of Urban Development and Sacred Areas). Provincial councils \nand local authorities are responsible for ensuring equitable resource allocation, and quality and \nstandards of service under the national policy on rural water supply and sanitation. Prior to 1975, \nlocal authorities were primarily responsible for the provision of piped water and public wells. In \n1974,  through  an  act  of  Parliament,  NWSDB  was  established  to  be  the  primary  agency \nresponsible for water supply and sanitation in the country. Subsequently several major urban \nwater supply schemes operated by local authorities were transferred to improve coverage and \nservice delivery. To date and in accordance with the country\u2019s laws, NWSDB,4 urban and \nmunicipal councils, and pradeshiya sabhas retain their mandate to provide water and sanitation. \nGenerally, NWSDB is responsible for planning, designing, constructing, and managing larger \nurban schemes; and supporting the development of rural schemes in areas declared under the \nNWSDB Act. All other rural areas come within the purview of local government or community-\nbased organizations.5 Capacity varies within the sector.6 While NWSDB\u2019s capacity is generally \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Country Operations Business Plan (2008): Sri Lanka. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 December 2007.  \n3  Draft policies on drinking water supply (2006) and on sanitation (2006). \n4  NWSDB operates a total of 287 water supply schemes, which service 38.6% of the population\u201428.6% with piped \nwater supply and 10% with hand-pumped tube wells. The rest of the population relies on water systems operated \nby communities, local authorities, and individual households, including wells and rain-harvesting systems. \n5  This indicates large overlapping mandates and functions among different central and local agencies, often leading \nto overlapping and confused accountability.  \n6  Significant support to capacity building for service provision for local authorities has been provided under ADB. \n2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors for a Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Local Government Infrastructure Improvement Project. Manila. \n ", "2   \nadequate, it needs support to implement its vision for gradual decentralization of operations, \ncapital planning, and administrative and financial functions to the regions. In addition, support \nfor autonomous regulation will help NWSDB achieve its goals of improving operating efficiency, \ncustomer satisfaction, and commercial viability.  \n \n4.  Accountable  Regulation. 7  In  late  2002,  Parliament  created  the  Public  Utilities \nCommission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), a multisector regulator for water, electricity, and ports. \nAlthough commissioners were appointed soon after, its functions could not be fully effected, \npartly due to delays in formulating and approving a water industry act.8 Subsequent efforts \ninclude the development of essential documentation and methodologies to monitor and improve \nfinancial performance, and customer and technical services.9 The Government is also finalizing \nthe necessary legal revisions to bring NWSDB\u2019s operations in line with the PUCSL Act and \nenable technical and economic regulation. Whilst the framework for operation is defined in the \nform of regulating guidelines; implementing systems, reporting mechanisms, protocols, and \nreviews are needed. Just as important, NWSDB is developing internal monitoring systems.  \n \n5.  NWSDB\u2019s Institutional Development: Corporate and Business Planning. NWSDB \nhas developed 5-year corporate plans since 1996. The latest plan10 clearly identifies commercial \nviability,  and  greater  accountability  and  transparency  as  key  goals  to  be  pursued  by  the \norganization over the 5 year period. The plan sets forth specific objectives and countrywide \ntargets to be achieved by NWSDB; however, shortcomings observed include (i) the need to link \nthis to a business plan (and supporting financial projections) that translates action plans into \nfinancial terms, and key result areas into tangible financial targets or performance indicators that \ncan  be  monitored;  and  (ii)  the  need  to  derive  national  goals  and  targets  from  regional \ninformation  and  develop  associated  monitoring  mechanisms.  The  corporate  plan  identifies \ncorporate investment and asset management as key focus areas; these need to be linked to a \nrealistic financial program. Moreover, NWSDB\u2019s tariff methodology is based on two components \nthat need to be carefully defined: (i) recurrent operating expenditure, as well as (ii) business and \nasset management plans that define the cost of capital over a 5-year period. The development \nof a business plan is essential to operationalize this methodology and NWSDB is taking the lead \nin its preparation.  \n \n6.  NWSDB  Institutional  Development:  Decentralization  of  Responsibilities  and \nFunctions. NWSDB has grown extensively since its creation in 1974, but its current size11 and \nexcessively centralized management approach has led to several inefficiencies. In addition to its \nhead  office,  NWSDB  is  currently  divided  into six  regional  support  centers  (RSCs)  and  23 \n                                                 \n7  Regulators are generally responsible for establishing, monitoring, and enforcing (i) discharge licenses and fees; \n(ii) service quality standards, as received by customers; and (iii) affordable and efficient tariffs. An effective \nregulatory framework will facilitate affordable delivery of adequate and safe water to consumers, especially the \npoor. Pricing rules try to balance the incentives to use water efficiently and social concerns such as quality of water \nsupply, universal service goals, and subsidy schemes for the poor. \n8  The Supreme Court declared the most recent Water Sector Reform bill (2002) unconstitutional on the basis that the \nprovision of piped water is a devolved responsibility in which the central Government has no power to legislate and \nthe Government did not obtain the concurrence of the provinces. In terms of the constitution, all national policy \nformulation rests with the central Government.  \n9  The  Ministry  of  Water  Supply  and  Drainage,  in  collaboration  with  NWSDB  and  PUCSL,  has  developed \n(i) amendments to the NWSDB Act to enable accountable regulation, (ii) tariff setting methodology, (iii) a customer \ncode, and (iv) technical standards for water and sewerage, through ADB TA. ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Strengthening the Regulatory Framework for Water Supply and \nSanitation. Manila. \n10  NWSDB. 2007. Corporate Plan (2007\u20132011). Colombo. \n11  In June 2007, NWSDB had 8,310 employees, of which 7,525 were regular staff. This is equivalent to 7.67 staff per \n1,000 connections. \n ", "  3\nregional  offices  throughout  Sri  Lanka.  Services  provided  (population  covered,  number  of \nconnections,  quality  and  quantity  of  water  available),  infrastructure  and  water  production, \nstaffing, operation and maintenance expenditure, and recovery vary significantly among the \nRSCs.12 In parallel, customer satisfaction, water resource availability, financial management, \nhuman resource management, and accountability vary across the country.13 Because the RSCs \nand  regional  offices  are  closer  to  the  beneficiary  population,  they  have  an  information \nadvantage  in  identifying  citizens\u2019  preferences  as  well  as  the  flexibility  to  respond  to  local \nconditions. As they act on this information to improve the quality and reliability of a variety of \nservices, consumers will be willing to pay more for services, which in turn can secure the \nimprovement and maintenance of the existing network, particularly in the most deprived areas.  \n \n7.  NWSDB\u2019s vision, as formulated in its latest corporate plan, proposes (i) decentralizing \nfinancial  and  administrative  authority;  to  be  followed,  on  a  performance  basis,  by \ndecentralization of additional responsibilities; and (ii) transforming the RSCs into small business \nunits with greater autonomy and accountability.14 The plan recognizes the need to strengthen \ncapacities of the RSCs and regional offices to provide more efficient and responsive service \ndelivery.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will support Government and NWSDB efforts to improve water sector utilities\u2019 \nmanagement, especially financial management, and regional operations within the context of \nrecent  sector  reforms  and  policies,  including  operationalization  of  credible  regulation. \nConsequently,  the  impact  of  the  TA  is  defined  as  improved  operating  efficiency  and \nmanagement performance in the water sector. Its outcomes are (i) NWSDB service delivery \nfunctions  decentralized  and  (ii)  NWSDB  internal  monitoring  and  regulatory  systems \noperationalized.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will be divided into two components, each supporting one of the expected TA \noutcomes. The TA is to deliver four specific outputs: (i) regional benchmarking and regional \nbusiness development plans, (ii) a capacity development program for decentralized service \ndelivery, (iii) a 5-year asset management plan for NWSDB, and (iv) a program to facilitate \ninternal monitoring and regulation in NWSDB. \n \n1.  Regional Benchmarking and Development Planning \n10.  Regional benchmarking will lead to the collection, analysis, and comparison of key \nprovincial performance data (technical, financial, institutional, and customer service). It will \nserve as an effective management, monitoring, and planning tool to help address localized \nproblems  and  improve  overall  performance.  Once  operating  baselines  are  determined, \n                                                 \n12  Western RSC, Greater Colombo RSC, and the head office account for almost 50% of NWSDB\u2019s staff resources, \n53% of NWSDB\u2019s connections, and 65% of all drinking water produced. NWSDB. 2006. Annual Report. Colombo. \n13  Comprehensive benchmarking data is not available. Instead project survey data and random questionnaires \nconducted by the Mission were used.    \n14  To achieve improved performance, NWSDB is revising its internal structure. As part of the proposed activities, the \nestablishment of 11 RSCs (one per province, Greater Colombo, and headquarters) is soon to be confirmed. \n ", "4   \ndiagnoses, targets, time-bound action plans, and financial requirements will be determined in \nthe form of a development or business plan for each of the 11 projected RSCs.  \n \n2.  Capacity Development for Decentralized Service Delivery  \n11.  In parallel and as an essential part of improved service delivery in every RSC, a human \nresource review will be conducted and a capacity development program provided to improve \nstaff capacity. Activities will include (i) preparation of training needs assessments for each of the \nRSCs; (ii) development of training programs and manuals in the fields of management of \noperations, capital investment planning, accounting and financial management, auditing, and \nnonrevenue water; and (iii) delivery of the training programs across the country. In line with \nobjective  5.2  of  the  corporate  plan,  the  TA  will  prepare  a  time-bound  program  for \ndecentralization  of  responsibilities;  this  will  be  carefully  considered  in  formulating  training \nprograms, particularly where human resource gaps are identified. \n \n3.  NWSDB Asset Management and Planning  \n12.  Based on information collected from the RSCs, baseline data will be reviewed and \nanalyzed at the national level. Subsequently, through a process of consultation and review of \nthe existing corporate plan and its targets as well as regional development plans, the TA will \ndevelop a 5-year asset management plan for NWSDB as an organization. NWSDB\u2019s corporate \nand business plan may be updated based on the outcomes of the consultation and financial \nconstraints identified, if any. \n \n4.  Facilitating Internal Monitoring and Regulation  \n13.  To catalyze the implementation of internal monitoring systems as well as technical and \neconomic regulation, the TA will support NWSDB in developing and implementing an agenda, \nincluding  working  plans  and  schedules.  Activities  and  associated  manuals  to  be  prepared \ninclude implementing and monitoring systems, reporting mechanisms, protocols, and reviews. \nThe activities are expected to lead to NWSDB\u2019s first submission for a rate review, and the \nregulator\u2019s  first  review  and  approval.15 As  part  of  the  program,  the  following  activities  are \nenvisaged: (i) short-term placements in established regulatory bodies in the region, (ii) focus \ntraining,  and  (iii) on-the-job  advisory  services  for  the  preparation  of  reporting  systems  and \nreviews.16  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent. The Cooperation Fund for the Water \nSector17 will provide $50,000 equivalent on a grant basis; ADB will administer the grant. ADB \nwill  provide  $700,000  equivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.18 The \nGovernment  will  contribute  the  remaining  $250,000  in  kind  or  otherwise,  including  office \naccommodation and utilities, counterpart staff, background reports, and workshop facilities. \nDetailed cost estimates and the financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n                                                 \n15  Additional related data required in support of NWSDB\u2019s first submission to the regulator, such as financial \nprojections and tariff setting computed using the existing model, will be utilized. The model was developed with \nADB\u2019s assistance (footnote 9)  \n16  This activity is contingent on parliamentary approval of the NWSDB Act amendments. The amendments should \ninclude provisions establishing formal and legal linkages between PUCSL and NWSDB. \n17  Contributors: the governments of the Netherlands and Norway. \n18  Expenditures and claims will be largely under a single contract jointly financed by the two financiers.  \n ", "  5\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MWSD and NWSDB will be executing and implementing agencies, respectively, of this \nTA. NWSDB will (i) appoint a TA unit coordinator, who will have a supportive, coordinating, and \nfacilitating role;19 and (ii) provide office space, furniture, equipment, and technical and support \ncounterpart  staff  to  the  TA  as  necessary.  Overall  guidance  for  TA  implementation  will  be \nprovided by the TA steering committee, which will be headed by the Secretary of MWSD and \ninclude senior officials from other government agencies, including the Ministry of Finance and \nPlanning,  NWSDB,  PUCSL,  and  representatives  from  development  partner  agencies.  The \nsteering committee will first meet upon submission of the first consultant\u2019s report and no later \nthan  4 weeks  after  the  start  of  the  TA  to  confirm  NWSDB  board  formal  approval  of  a \ndecentralized program of functions. The TA is proposed to be implemented over 9 months from \nSeptember 2008 to June 2009. A team of international and national consultants will be selected \nand recruited through a firm using the quality- and cost-based selection method to provide a \ntotal  of  76.5  person-months  of  consulting  services:  14.5  person-months  of  international \nconsulting,  and  62  person-months  of  national  consulting.  The  international  consultants  will \ninclude  experts  in  water  utility  institutions,  financial  management  and  tariffs,  commercial \noperations,  and  water  sector  regulations.  The  national  consultants  will  include  experts  in \nfinancial  analysis,  training,  environment  and  safety  compliance,  auditing,  human  resource \nmanagement,  evaluation  and  monitoring,  customer  services,  project accounting,  and  water \nengineering. ADB will select and engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for \nTA consultants are presented in Appendix 3.  \n  \n16.  ADB\u2019s full technical proposal will be used in selecting consultants. Extensive workshops \nand consultations will be conducted under the TA, as these are essential to secure ownership \nand knowledge transfer. Office equipment financed by the TA will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and handed over to \nthe Government on completion of the TA activities. The consultants will submit four major \nreports: (i) an inception report no later than 4 weeks following the commencement of services, \n(ii) an interim report within 5 months, (iii) a draft report at the end of the 8th month, and (iv) a \nfinal report within 4 weeks of receiving Government and ADB comments on the draft report. The \nconsultants  will  submit  short  monthly  progress  notes  summarizing  TA  activities,  issues, \nconstraints, and proposed solutions. Tripartite meetings will be held with ADB, Government \nrepresentatives, and the consultants to review the inception, midterm, and draft final reports and \nverify accomplishments. The consultants will translate the TA key deliverables to facilitate their \nreview by the Government and stakeholders. The TA will also recruit an individual international \nconsultant for 4 person-months to improve project management practices within NWSDB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $50,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector; and (ii) ADB providing \nthe balance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of \nSri Lanka for Institutional Strengthening for Decentralized Service Delivery in the Water Sector, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n19  The TA coordinator is expected to be able to devote at least 2 full days per week to this TA. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved operating  NWSDB\u2019s annual  NWSDB\u2019s annual report  \u2022  Macroeconomic stability \nefficiency and  review of performance   \nmanagement  indicators  Risks \nperformance in the   \n\u2022  Timely review of tariffs \nwater sector \nindependent of political \n \ninterference \nOutcome      Assumptions \n1.

Part A: Benchmarking (2.5 months) \n2.   Benchmarking  (both  as  an  output  and  as  a  process)  will  be  developed  to  support \ncollaborative learning by the RSCs and the corporate planning section of National Water Supply \nand  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB).  It  will  focus  on  specific  operating  practices,  comparing \nmeasures and results, and identifying improved processes for each region. Key components will \ninclude  (i)  data  gathering  in  the  form  of  detailed  surveys  of  measures  and  processes; \n(ii) identification of best performance, best practices, and any reasons for deviation; and (iii) site \nvisits, where best practice is relevant. \n \n3.   Benchmarking will help improve sector efficiencies and adequately develop responses to \ndemand. The team of consultants will conduct a benchmarking exercise in all 11 RSCs.1 The \nconsultants will \n                                                 \n1  Currently six RSCs are operating, three are being developed, and two are anticipated. The team will review the \ndata regionally and consider the new demarcation. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n(i)  conduct one or two opening workshops to (a) introduce benchmarking concepts \nand objectives to RSC managers, and (b) jointly develop and agree on most \nsuitable indicators (e.g., technical, managerial, financial, customer orientation);2 \n(ii)  based on selected indicators, identify and list parameters to be measured and \nask RSC to initiate data collection (historical and current); \n(iii)  review archive data within NWSDB and data provided by each RSC, and where \nnecessary, support RSCs in collecting and mapping supplementary data;  \n(iv)  jointly with each RSC, analyze the data3 and develop a diagnosis;4 and \n(v)  review jointly with NWSDB (corporate planning) the overall results and write a \nbrief report for publication. \n4.   This study is expected to be comprehensive and include areas such as (i) general \ninformation,  (ii)  service  area  and  service  provision,  (iii)  infrastructure  description, \n(iv) consumption and production, (v) system performance and system reliability, (vi) staff and \nhuman  resources,  (vii)  customers  and  commercial  aspects,  (viii)  operating  efficiency  and \nfinancial performance, and (ix) physical asset provision and capital investment.5  \n \n5.  In  addition,  the  consultants  will  (i)  develop  and,  if  necessary,  restructure  the  data \ncollection  process  and  baseline  reporting;  and  (ii)  determine  formal  and  informal  reporting \ncommunication requirements with regulatory agencies.   \n \nC.  Part B: Institutional Strengthening and Planning (6 months) \n6.   Phase  I:  Regional  Development  Planning.  Using  baseline  regional  data  and \ndiagnoses prepared for each RSC, the consultants will undertake the following: \n \n(i)  Establish realistic targets for overall improvement.  \n                                                 \n2  This is intended to develop a strategy for analyzing local utilities consider international best practice, identify \nperformance measurements, and create a benchmark chart to analyze practices. Measurable and meaningful \nindictors of performance should reflect obvious features of the service to allow evaluators to understand variations \nin  service  performance  over  time.  Indicators  may  focus  on  quality,  efficiency,  affordability,  or  comparative \nperformance. Some may be expressed as indexes adjusted for different operating conditions. \n3  For this assignment, each team is expected to spend at least 2\u20133 days with each RSC. \n4  The diagnosis may be made in relation to the overall and RSC-based management structure, operating efficiency, \npolicies, and cost recovery. \n5  Areas under review may include (i) general information (region-province, principal city-town, type of services, \nprivate sector involvement, if any); (ii) service area (area of responsibility, service area, population in area of \nresponsibility, population in service area, population served, number of towns served); (iii) infrastructure description \n(raw  water  source,  treatment  method,  production  capacity,  distribution  length,  storage  capacity,  number  of \nconnections,  operating  water  meters,  service  connection  length);  (iv)  consumption  and  production  (RSC \nproduction,  bulk  water  bought,  metered  consumption,  unmetered  consumption,  meter  inaccuracy,  water \nbilled/sold), (v) system performance (intermittent supply, supply duration, water main pressure, water main pipe \nbreaks, residual chlorine tests required/performed/passed); (vi) staff (employment type, number of staff, training \nevent participation, number of training days, human resource development expenditure); (vii) customers (number of \nnew  customers,  number  of  customer  complaints,  means  of  complaining,  ways  to  understand  customers, \nconnection charges, fixed water supply charges, consumption charges, lower slab cubic meter/month water bill); \n(viii) finance (water supply revenue, end-of-year accounts receivable, RSC operating expenses, water supply \noperating expenses); and (ix) capital investment (source of funds, gross fixed asset values, debt servicing costs). \n ", "                Appendix 3        11 \n(ii)  Set a realistic strategy, and subsequently a tailored and highly specific activity \nprogram with a time-bound action plan and associated budget for implementation \nover 5 years.6 \n(iii)  Review RSC structure and propose amendments to its human resource base, as \nrequired. \n(iv)  Where relevant, prepare simplified financial projections to support the proposals.7 \n(v)  Based on these, prepare RSC-specific business development plans. and \n(vi)  Prepare reporting programs outlining frequencies of reliable data collection and \nstandard formats.   \n \n7.  In parallel, the consultants will review the recently completed asset register and its \nvaluation,8 and prepare a program for the RSCs to formulate asset management plans. The \nRSCs will need to commit to allocating the necessary human resources. The consultants will \nundertake the following: \n \n(i)  Prepare a (a) common framework, (b) property information system,9 (c) clear \nmethodology for assessing the condition of physical assets,10 (d) methodology for \nsuitability and sufficiency assessments,11 and (e) methodology for formulating an \nasset management plan. All this should be in the form of a manual. \n(ii)  Conduct workshops for RSC staff to (a) introduce concepts, (b) present case \nstudies, (c) provide practical sessions on how to conduct the assessment, and  \n(d) provide a time frame for completion of data collection and classification by \neach RSC. \n(iii)  On completion of the assessments, (a) review the data provided and provide \nrecommendations to the RSCs, (b) conduct additional workshops to the same \nRSC technical and managerial staff on how to translate asset condition data and \nassessments into RSC-based asset management plans, and (c) provide a time \nframe for completion of the RSC asset management plans. \n(iv)  On completion of the asset management plans by the RSCs, (a) review these \nand provide recommendations, and (b) revisit the proposed RSC-based business \ndevelopment  plans  and  determine  whether,  based  on  asset  management \nfindings, revisions are necessary. \n \n8.  Phase II: NWSDB Asset Management and Planning. On completion of RSC-specific \nplans,  the  consultants  will  (i)  review  draft  business  objectives  and  financial  projections \nundertaken by NWSDB\u2019s financial department; (ii) review NWSDB\u2019s corporate plan (2007\u20132011) \n                                                 \n6  The content may vary, including targets for improvements in metering, nonrevenue water programs, energy \nefficiency programs, increases in number of connections, billing and collection practices, and employee satisfaction \nand retention. \n7  The model developed under a related ADB TA could be used. ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Sri Lanka for \nStrengthening the Regulatory Framework for Water Supply and Sanitation. Manila (TA 4049). \n8  The valuation of NWSDB assets countrywide is to be completed within 2008. The register and valuation has been \nlargely prepared at RSC level.  \n9  Ideally this should be linked to NWSDB\u2019s management information system. However if not technically feasible \ngiven the nature of the package, a simplified off-the-shelf package (Microsoft Excel or other) should be utilized.  \n10  Parameters to be considered include (i) type of asset that needs to be supplied, (ii) condition classification, and (iii) \npriority classification.  \n11  This assessment is intended to determine whether physical infrastructure is adequate to cover its intended \npurpose.  \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nand its goals; and (iii) review NWSDB\u2019s business operations and processes,12 and business \nplans (if any); and make recommendations for improvement.  \n \n9.  Based on these activities (para. 8) and phase I findings, the consultants will (i) prepare a \nconsolidated NWSDB asset management plan and (ii) update, as required, the existing NWSDB \ncorporate and 5-year business plan. The process will be iterative and revisions to RSC plans \nwill  be  conducted  in  consultation  with  NWSDB\u2019s  planning  departments.  The  process  will \nconclude with a workshop to present findings and ensure full acceptance of all stakeholders.  \n \nD.  Part C: Capacity Development for Decentralized Service Delivery (5 months) \n10.  In line with NWSDB\u2019s self-identified objectives of improving service delivery through the \ntransfer of a greater number of functions to its regional offices and based on the diagnosis \nassessment conducted in part A of the assignment, the consultants will review the capacity of \nthe RSCs and their human resources, and suggest means for improvement as follows: \n \n(i)  Conduct a training needs assessment for each RSC.  \n(ii)  Prepare a time-bound program of decentralization of responsibilities. \n(iii)  Review work conducted by financial management, audit, human resource, and \ncommercial and administration sections; and provide recommendations wherever \nnecessary. \n(iv)  Develop training programs and simple manuals13 for use in the management of \nfield  operations  (with  particular  emphasis  on  nonrevenue  water), 14  capital \ninvestment  planning,  accounting  and  financial  management,  administrative \nservices, auditing, and management.  \n(v)  Deliver training programs across the country. \n \nE.  Part D: NWSDB Internal Monitoring and Regulation (4\u20135 months) \n11.  To catalyze this process, the TA will support NWSDB in developing and implementing an \nagenda (inclusive of working plans and schedules) to operationalize internal monitoring systems \nand accountable regulation. Specific deliverables include the following: \n \n(i)  Prepare a 2-year activity program outlining specific actions for implementation (and \nidentifying financial resources associated with it). \n(ii)  Prepare and implement monitoring systems, reporting mechanisms, protocols, and \nreviews; and support both agencies (utility and regulator) in the preparation and \nsubmission of the first official documentation set. \n(iii)  Based on the 5-year business plan and agreed tariff methodology, support NWSDB \nto submit its first rate review and the regulator\u2019s review and approval.   \n \n12.  In addition, as part of the program, the consultants will  \n  \n                                                 \n12  This should consider all aspects, including management processes, operating processes, and other supporting \nprocesses.  \n13  Wherever manuals have been prepared (e.g., financial management and accounting), the consultants will review \nand determine whether any areas need strengthening. \n14  Nonrevenue  water  programs  are  expected  to  focus  on  nontechnical  issues  as  the  Danish  International \nDevelopment Agency is expected to complete a comprehensive operation and maintenance program in parallel. \n ", "                Appendix 3        13 \n(i)  help arrange and coordinate short-term placements in established regulatory bodies \nand  utilities  in  the  region  for  two  nominated  utility  and  regulatory  staff  to \nsubsequently undertake these tasks for their respective organizations; \n(ii)  provide focus training activities for (a) tariff setting, (b) standards monitoring and \nevaluation, and (c) customer services satisfaction; and \n(iii)  provide on-the-job advisory services for the preparation of reporting systems and \npractical review.  \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080424160322+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "tar: sri lanka 41679,decentralized service\r\ndelivery, water sector, water sector cooperation fund, institutional strength,sustainable economic growth, water supply, sanitation waste management  ", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080430141343+08'00'", "Title": "Institutional Strengthening for Decentralized Service Delivery in the Water Sector (Cofinanced by the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector)"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 19 March 2008) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  Sri Lanka rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \nSLRe1.00 =  $0.0092721372 \n$1.00 =  SLRs107.850  \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  MWSD  \u2013  Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage \n  NWSDB  \u2013  National Water Supply and Drainage Board \n  PUCSL  \u2013  Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka \n  RSC  \u2013  regional support center \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  General intervention \nSector  \u2013  Water supply, sanitation, and waste management \nSubsector  \u2013  Water supply and sanitation  \nThemes  \u2013  Governance, capacity development, inclusive social \ndevelopment \nSubthemes  \u2013  Public governance, institutional development, human \ndevelopment \n \n \nGLOSSARY \n \n  pradeshiya sabha  \u2013  Smallest political unit in periurban and rural areas  \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The  fiscal  year  of  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  and  its  agencies  ends  on \n31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \nVice President  L.
