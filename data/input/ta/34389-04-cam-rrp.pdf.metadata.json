I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 4 of the \nFinancial Sector Program II (FSP II). \n \n2.  The development framework for Cambodia\u2019s finance sector is based on the 10-year \nrolling blueprint, last updated and adopted by the government in February 2007 as the Financial \nSector  Development  Strategy  2006\u20132015.  Through  the  first  Financial  Sector  Program 1                \n2001\u20132007 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the government was able to lay the legal \nand  regulatory  foundations  necessary  for  a  sound,  market-oriented  finance  sector.                        \nThe government also took strong measures to consolidate the banking system and introduce \nmore stringent requirements for capital adequacy, governance, and risk management. With \nsignificant results achieved from the first FSP, and to ensure the durability of its reform program \nand  inclusive  access  to  financial  services  by  ordinary  citizens,  the  government  requested \ncontinuing ADB support to the sector. This led to the design and approval of the FSP II in 2007.2 \nComprising a series of four single-tranche subprograms, the FSP II commenced in September \n20063 and will be completed in December 2010 at the conclusion of subprogram 4. The FSP II \nhas helped to strengthen resilience, improve public confidence and financial intermediation, \npromote good governance, and enhance efficiency in Cambodia's finance sector. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n  3.  Inclusive economic growth for poverty reduction. Cambodia\u2019s real gross domestic \nproduct grew strongly at about 9.1% per year on average from 1998 to 2008. This robust \neconomic performance was led by the private sector, particularly in garments, tourist-related \nservices, construction, and agriculture, with a substantial proportion being financed from foreign \ndirect  investments  and  the  domestic  financial  system.  With  a  rapidly  growing  commercial \neconomy that requires a sound financial system to sustain its rate of growth, the government is \ncommitted to long-term development of the finance sector, channeling financial resources to \nproductive  investments,  and  managing  the  inherent  risks  to  achieve  long-term  sustainable \neconomic growth and indirectly contribute to poverty reduction. The Asian financial crisis of the \nlate 1990s and the global financial crisis that began in 2008 devastated many economies by \nwiping out several years of growth within a very short time. To promote sustainable economic \ngrowth, reduce poverty, and help to mitigate shocks emanating from external financial crises, \nADB plays an important role in supporting finance sector development in its developing member \ncountries, including Cambodia. \n                                                 \n 1   ADB. 2001.

", "2 \n  \n4.  Aligning government commitment to reform with ADB strategy. The government\u2019s \ncommitment to developing the finance sector is outlined in the 5-year National Strategy and \nDevelopment  Plan  2006\u20132010  and  the  Rectangular  Strategy  (phase  2)  of  2008.                      \nThe government\u2019s vision in the Financial Sector Development Strategy 2006\u20132015 provides a \nlong-term  strategy  and  a  delineated  framework  of  reforms.  In  line  with  the  priorities  and \nstrategies  identified  in  the  government\u2019s  National  Strategy  and  Development  Plan  and \nRectangular Strategy (phase 2), ADB\u2019s country strategy and program focuses on three strategic \npillars:  (i)  broad-based  economic  growth  through  investments  in  physical  infrastructure, \ndevelopment  of  the  finance  sector,  support  for  greater  regional  integration,  sustainable \ndevelopment  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  and  investments  in  agriculture  and \nirrigation; (ii) inclusive social development; and (iii) good governance.4 ADB\u2019s country strategy \nand  program  specifically  states  that  ADB  will  continue  its  leading  role  in  finance  sector \ndevelopment as it is one of the five core areas that best supports ADB's Strategy 20205 and its \ngoal to reduce poverty in Cambodia. \n \n5.  Promoting inclusive finance for poverty reduction. ADB has supported reforms in \nCambodia's finance sector since 1999. The program loan cluster approach under the first FSP \nwas successful as it provided effective and flexible ways of converting complex policy objectives \ninto implementable policy actions. Following on from the first FSP, the FSP II cluster enabled \nthe government to continue strengthening the finance sector and to introduce a combination of \nlegal  and  regulatory  reforms,  target  capacity  building,  improve  disclosure  standards  and \nfinancial transparency, and establish key financial infrastructure, including the payments and \nsettlement system. Finance sector development helps to reduce poverty by lowering transaction \ncosts of economic activities and extending the outreach of the formal finance sector to the poor \nand  to  rural  microenterprises.  While  an  efficient  financial  system  promotes  private  sector \ndevelopment and foreign direct investment, a robust finance sector protects the economy from \nunfavorable  exogenous  shocks,  which  are  becoming  more  common  in  increasingly  global \nfinancial markets, thus reducing the likelihood of falling into poverty again.     \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The overall impact of the FSP II is a sound, market-based finance sector to enhance \nresource mobilization and support sustainable economic growth. The expected outcome is a \ngrowing, resilient, and efficient financial system. The design and monitoring framework for the \nprogram is in Appendix 1; a list of linked documents is in Appendix 2. The development policy \nletter  for  the  FSP  II  cluster  is  in  Appendix  3.  The  policy  actions  for  subprogram  4  and            \nmedium-term  program  with  a  post-program  partnership  framework  are  in  Appendix  4.                   \nWith changing domestic circumstances and developmental priorities, the government requested \nminor  modifications  to  two  of  the  triggers.  These  were  endorsed  by  ADB  management              \n(footnote 1 in Appendix 4).  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n7.  Continuing the reforms initiated under subprograms 1, 2, and 3, subprogram 4 has nine \nkey reform actions (triggers) that the government began implementing in January 2010.

At  the  conclusion  of \nsubprogram 4, the following outputs will have been accomplished under the FSP II cluster: \n \n   1.  Improved Confidence and Financial Intermediation \n \n8.  Modernized  payments,  clearance,  and  settlement  system.  The  process  for \nmodernizing the national payments, clearance, and settlement system (PCSS) started in 2006 \nwhen the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) established the Payments Policy Unit (PPU).     \nWith technical assistance (TA) from ADB, the NBC developed a road map for modernizing the \nnational PCSS and, under subprogram 1, signed a memorandum of understanding with each \ncommercial bank endorsing the road map. Key actions of phase I of the road map were \nimplemented by the NBC under subprogram 2 in 2008. These included the issuance of a  \nprakas 6 on check standardization and the launch of an interbank switch between four banks \n(since increased to five banks). With a long-term payment expert funded by ADB, the road map \nto modernize the PCSS was updated and adopted under subprogram 3. In addition, an interim \nsoftware  solution  for  check  clearance  was developed  by  the  NBC  Information  Technology \nDivision and launched in May 2009, together with a set of rules and procedures to regulate the \nclearance and settlement of checks. \n \n9.  Under subprogram 4, the PPU has worked closely with commercial banks to improve the \nefficiency of check clearance and settlement, resolve issues relating to retail mobile phone \npayments, and identify practical solutions to enhance funds transfer and faster bank settlement. \nTo enhance funds transfer and early settlement, the PPU has developed a credit remittance \npayment instrument to be used as (i) a direct funds transfer instrument; (ii) a direct credit \ninstrument; and (iii) a direct debit instrument for government salary payment, utility payments, \nand settlement between banks. The credit remittance payment instrument has been discussed \nwidely with the Association of Bankers in Cambodia (ABC) and issued by the NBC in August \n2010, together with an accompanied prakas. The NBC has obtained funds ($3.6 million) from \nthe Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) under the FSP II grant to finance the upgrading of \nthe interim software solution to a centralized full-solution software system for clearance and \nsettlement of checks. The PPU has prepared the bid documents in close consultation with ADB, \nand the procurement process began in July 2010 with the publication of invitation for bids.        \nTwo commercial banks have introduced funds transfer to rural areas using mobile phones.       \nTo regulate and protect all parties, a prakas on third-party processor was issued by the NBC in \nAugust 2010.  \n \n10.  Consumer  access  to  credit  and  market  confidence  enhanced.  The  orderly \ndevelopment and expansion of the financial market requires knowledgeable customers and \ncompetent providers of financial services. Since 2005, all banks have been required to publish \ntheir audited financial statements to enable the public to make informed judgments regarding \nwhere to place their deposits and with which banks to transact. The FSP II supported the NBC \nin its efforts to promote bank transparency by requiring all audited financial statements of banks \nas well as new prudential regulations to be published on the NBC website. This was achieved in \n2008 and several banks have since published these annual audited financial reports on their \nown websites. \n \n11.  With close cooperation between the NBC and the ABC, a pilot online credit information \nsharing system (CIS), using negative data, was established in August 2006 under the Small and \n                                                 \n6 Khmer term for regulations or instructions issued by the NBC governor or a government minister. \n ", "4 \nMedium Enterprise Development Program.7 A number of actions were taken up through the \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Development Program to the end of 2007 to improve the software \nsystem. At the conclusion of the program in 2007, the FSP II helped familiarize stakeholders \nwith the system and addressed necessary changes to the CIS and its management structure to \nenhance effectiveness. During subprogram 2, the NBC continued to help resolve systematic \nissues related to the CIS software and added microfinance institutions (MFIs) to the negative \nCIS  system  during  subprogram  3.  Plans  to  upgrade  the  software  system  to  include  other \nsources of credit data covering both banks and MFIs, and the possibility of corporatizing the \nCIS, was expected to come on stream during subprogram 4. At the beginning of 2010, the ABC \nand the Cambodian MFI association formed a joint venture with an international service provider \nto establish a credit bureau fully owned by the private sector. The NBC retains the regulatory \nrole to ensure the cost of services is affordable and to maintain the confidentiality of the shared \ninformation. \n \n12.  Interbank  market  and  tradable  government  securities  developed.  The  Law  on \nGovernment Securities was enacted in January 2007 to provide a framework for the efficient \nissuance and management of government securities. Under subprogram 2, the NBC was able \nto establish a registry system and train staff in the functions and operation of the registry.    \nWhen subprogram 3 came on stream, the development of a short-term money market was a \npriority and, to provide liquidity support, the NBC introduced regulations covering an interbank \nrepurchase  master  agreement  for  secured  interbank  transactions  in  the  money  market  in \nOctober  2009.  With  the  advent  of  subprogram  4,  the  NBC  went  further  and  formulated \nregulations that were issued as a prakas in October 2010 to allow the use of NBC certificates of \ndeposit as collateral for interbank transactions. Though the framework is in place, banks are \nexperiencing high liquidity and are not likely to utilize this facility in 2010. \n \n13.  Outreach  in  the  formal  sector  promoted.  Banking  activities  in  rural  areas  are \nimproving, with MFIs providing most of the formal financial services. The formal microfinance \nindustry  is  growing  rapidly,  with  credit  growing  from  $92.2  million  at  the  end  of  2006  to               \n$339.6 million at the end of June 2010. Rapid expansion of credit has put pressure on the \nsources of funding for MFIs, as most of their capital and debts are generated from overseas \nsources. A review by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor identified that the development \nof deposit services by MFIs has lagged behind credit services. These issues, such as making \ndomestic finance more widely accessible to MFIs, are being addressed by the NBC under the \nFSP  II.  As  a  first  step,  the  NBC  introduced  a  regulation  covering  the  minimum  financial, \ninstitutional, and managerial requirements for MFIs wishing to collect and intermediate voluntary \npublic deposits under subprogram 3. The regulation has, among other things, increased the \nminimum capital requirement from $62,000 to $2.5 million. Four qualified MFIs were granted \nlicenses during subprogram 4 and three applications are being processed. Since early 2009,  \nthe NBC has encouraged individual commercial banks to lend directly to MFIs, and in June \n2010 the NBC reported that seven banks were providing credit to MFIs\u2014two in local currency \nand the other five in US dollars.  \n \n2.  Maintained Stability in the Finance Sector   \n \n14.  Updated legal and regulatory framework for banks. As part of efforts to strengthen \nprudential supervision, update regulations, and ensure stability, the NBC issued regulations           \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Small and Medium Enterprise Development \nProgram. Manila (Loan 2129-CAM). \n ", "5 \n(i) on large exposures of banks and financial institutions, and (ii) to amend the prakas on \nlicensing  of  commercial  and  specialized  banks  under  the  FSP  II.  The  NBC  also  issued \nregulations on (i) fit and proper tests on bank management; (ii) corporate governance for banks \nand financial institutions, and (iii) updated asset classification and provisioning for banks and \nfinancial institutions. Further, the NBC undertook a comprehensive review of the 1999 Law on \nBanking and Financial Institutions (LBFI) to address the features of a changing domestic market \nand the reality of increasing international economic integration. The review benefited from TA \nprovided by ADB (footnote 2) and took into consideration consumer protection, bank secrecy \nprovisions to support development of the CIS, procedures for administering distressed and \ninsolvent banks, and protection or immunity of bank regulators. A revised and updated LBFI was \nsubmitted to the Council of Ministers (COM) in October 2009 with the expectation that it would \nbe submitted to the National Assembly during subprogram 4. Discussions at the COM began in \nFebruary 2010 before the International Monetary Fund and World Bank 2010 Financial Sector \nAssessment Program began. With additional suggestions emanating from the 2010 Financial \nSector Assessment Program, the NBC decided to withdraw the revised LBFI to incorporate \nthose comments and also revise the law on conduct and organization of the NBC. Both the \nrevised laws will be submitted to the COM in 2011.  \n \n15.  Strengthened  bank  supervision  capacity  and  measures  adopted  to  sustain \nfinancial stability. Updating and upgrading skills is a priority area that must be an ongoing \nfeature of any program aimed at developing and deepening the financial system. With TA \nof $1.7 million (footnote 2) that was approved together with the FSP II, ADB has been providing \ntechnical support to upgrade the capacity of NBC's supervision staff and strengthen the NBC\u2019s \nsurveillance  capability.  While  ADB  supports  the  bank  on-site  supervision  aspect,  the \nInternational Monetary Fund provides a resident adviser to develop the off-site capability of the \nNBC. As an indication of the importance that ADB places on the NBC\u2019s work in this area, ADB \napproved TA together with subprogram 2 in 2008 that provided on-the-job guidance to bank    \non-site supervision teams.8 The TA culminated in a detailed review of the six largest commercial \nbanks during subprogram 3, and the results of the on-site inspections proved very useful in \nrecent analysis of the impact of the global economic crisis on Cambodia\u2019s banking system.   \nADB also approved TA in 2009 to help the government implement the triggers for subprogram 4 \nand as part of its continuing capacity support to the NBC.9 The NBC has also introduced \nremedial measures broadly anchored on the FSP II program policy framework, which the NBC \nis closely monitoring, and has put in place stronger sanctions to address potential vulnerabilities \nin the banking system.  \n \n16.  Prudential supervision and regulations for microfinance institutions strengthened. \nThe NBC has made significant progress in building the regulatory framework for licensing and \nsupervising registered MFIs. A division for prudential supervision of MFIs within the Banking \nSupervision Department has been established and several prudential regulations in the form of \nprakas have been issued, such as that to amend the prakas on the licensing of MFIs, and those \ncovering MFIs that can mobilize voluntary savings (2007) and the management of foreign \nexchange risks (2008). During the implementation of the FSP II and under ADB TA, staff have \nbeen trained in the implementation of these regulations, and in off-site and on-site supervision \ntechniques (footnotes 2, 8, and 9). With the growing number and size of activities generated by \n                                                 \n8  Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Implementation of Key Policy Triggers of Subprogram 3 \n(TA 7185-CAM) attached to ADB. 2008.

Manila (TA 7472-CAM). \n ", "6 \nregistered money changers, the NBC issued a code of conduct for implementation during \nsubprogram 4. The NBC has conducted a series of workshops to explain the purpose of the \ncode  and  the  roles  and  obligations  of  each  money  changer.  Since  then,  14  large  money \nchangers have been licensed and 25 have notified the NBC of their affiliation with licensed \ncommercial banks.  \n   \n17.  Legal  foundation  to  support  financial  and  commercial  transactions  enhanced.    \nFor  financial  transactions  to  develop  beyond  basic,  short-term,  and  mainly  cash-based \ntransactions, a legal framework for commerce and finance must be developed, updated, and \nimplemented. This was one of the achievements of the FSP II when the government adopted \nthe Law on Government and Private Sector Securities in 2007. For laws that were recently \nenacted, the adoption of implementing subdecrees was required. The enactment of new laws \nhas been followed by the development of training curricula at certain legal faculties to train legal \npractitioners and judges in these new principles. ADB provided technical support (footnote 2) \nto help  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC) draft  a  new  law  on  commercial  contracts  with \nprovisions relating to agencies and franchising. The draft law was submitted to the COM in \nOctober 2009 and to the National Assembly during subprogram 4.  \n \n3.  Promoted Good Governance \n \n18.  International initiatives on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of \nterrorism  promoted.  Recent  moves  to  implement  anti-money  laundering  and  combat  the \nfinancing of terrorism in Cambodia are directly in line with international deterrence efforts and \nstandard governance principles to help build market confidence. The government enacted the \nLaw  on  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  in  2007  under \nsubprogram 1. This was followed by the adoption of prakas covering the appointment of the \nboard of directors, the secretary general to head the Cambodian Financial Intelligence Unit \n(CAFIU), and the authority to establish the CAFIU during subprogram 2, followed by the formal \nestablishment of the CAFIU during subprogram 3. ADB, the Asia Pacific Group on Money \nLaundering,  the  Australian  Transaction  Reports  and  Analysis  Centre,  the  Bank  Negara \nMalaysia,  and  the  World  Bank  provided  TA  that  helped  the  CAFIU  prepare  the  following \nregulations: (i) internal rules and code of conduct for the CAFIU; (ii) CAFIU\u2019s business plan for \n2010\u20132012;  (iii) a  strategy  and  implementation  plan  for  initiatives  on  combating  money \nlaundering and the financing of terrorism; and (iv) a subdecree on combating money laundering \nand the financing of terrorism, covering all other reporting entities not regulated by the NBC. All \nthese regulations have been adopted by the CAFIU board of directors during subprogram 4. \nThe CAFIU reported that, of the 69 suspicious transactions reported in 2010, two have been \npassed on to the police for prosecution. \n \n19.  Corporate  governance  and  transparency  in  the  insurance  industry  enhanced.      \nTo build consumer confidence in insurance as a service, the public must first understand the \ninsurance business and the services it can provide. The goal for all participants in the industry is \nto  raise  their  operations  to  international  standards.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  MEF  issued \nregulations on premium rates for fire insurance, and licensing of general and life insurance \ncompanies. The MEF also issued prakas covering corporate governance and solvency for \ninsurance companies in early 2008. A prakas on accounting guidelines for general insurance \nwas adopted under subprogram 2 and, with technical support from ADB (footnote 8), the MEF \nworked  closely  with  the  association  of  insurance  companies  to  ensure  the  smooth \nimplementation of the reporting standards. The MEF also revised the insurance law which was \nsubmitted  to  the  COM  during  subprogram  3.  During  subprogram  4,  the  MEF  required  all \ninsurance companies to publish their audited financial statements. \n ", "7 \n \n20.  Commercial  dispute  resolution  mechanism  established.  To  promote  good \ngovernance in the financial system, the government enacted the law on commercial arbitration \nin 2006. After the COM adopted the subdecree in 2009, a national arbitration center (NAC) was \nestablished. ADB TA (footnote 2) helped the MOC select the 54 founding members, formulate \nthe rules and administrative procedures, prepare a code of conduct for the NAC, and train those \nselected  in  June\u2013July  2010.  There  is  no  specific  legal  requirement  for  arbitrators  to  sit  a \nqualifying examination, and the MOC is awaiting a directive from the prime minister requiring all \ncommercial arbitrators to sit the qualifying examination. That would give credibility to the NAC \nand help ensure its future successful operations.  \n \n21.  Accounting institutions and professional capacity of members strengthened.  In a \nmove to strengthen and increase accounting and auditing capacity and standards, the MEF \nintroduced a government-funded scholarship scheme to enable 70 recipients annually to study \ntoward becoming members of the Kampuchea Institute of Certified Public Accountants and \nAuditors. These scholarships were initially awarded only to government civil servants but poor \nperformance  and  a  high  dropout  rate  in  the  initial  phase  prompted  ADB  to  persuade  the \ngovernment to open the scholarships to the public in the second half of 2006. Selection was to \nbe strictly on merit. The MEF reviewed the performance of the certified public accountant \nscholarship program in 2009 and noted that, of the 598 scholarships awarded, only 6 scholars \nhad completed the 3.5 years course of study, 376 were continuing, and 216 had dropped out; \n10 students are expected to successfully complete the course in 2010. Two units have been \nidentified as the stumbling blocks for most students: United Kingdom Corporate and Business \nLaw and United Kingdom Taxation Law. The MEF has proposed to revise both units so that \nlocal laws will be used instead. During subprogram 4, the MEF introduced 35 scholarships for \nthe 2-year certified accounting technician program. \n \n4.  Enhanced Efficiency in the Finance Sector  \n \n22.  Key  operating  functions  of  the National  Bank  of  Cambodia  computerized  and \nintegrated. The FSP II supported the NBC's efforts to implement an integrated system that \nlinked the accounting department to the cash management functions in the issues department, \nthe customer account management in the banking operations department, and the foreign \nexchange  transactions  in  the  exchange  management  department.  Under  subprogram  1,          \nthe NBC adopted the information technology architecture model for a total estimated cost of        \n$4.0 million. The MEF allocated a $4.0 million grant to the NBC to finance the new system, \nincluding the required hardware, and ADB TA (footnote 2) provided two international consultants \nto assist the NBC in procuring, designing, and installing the system. Under subprogram 2,       \nthe NBC acquired the software and hardware using international bidding. Installation of the \nhardware began during subprogram 3. In July 2009, the final testing of the hardware was \ncompleted and the operating system, Oracle software, and database were installed. Following \nthe  completion  of  product  walk-through  and  functional  training  the  system  went  live  in      \nFebruary 2010. The same system has been successfully rolled out to eight NBC branches \nduring subprogram 4, and implementation of the branch roll-out plan will continue to early 2011.  \n \n23.  Capacity of microfinance institution staff upgraded. Finding adequately trained and \nskilled people to meet the needs of a growing microfinance industry is an ongoing challenge.   \nTo that end, the FSP II included TA that has helped upgrade the curriculum for the Center for \nBanking Studies, added two specialized training curricula for MFIs, and updated a course on \nmoney and banking. All three courses were offered in the first semester of 2010, with 150 \nstudents enrolled for each course.   \n ", "8 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n24.  The Government of Cambodia has requested a loan of $10 million equivalent and a \ngrant of $5 million, both from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 4.  \nThe loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft financing agreement. \n \n25.  The loan amount for subprogram 4 is based on a number of factors10 that support the \nimplementation of reforms under the FSP II. These include the importance attached to the \nreform program by the government, direct administrative and adjustment costs involved in \ndesign  and  implementation  of  specific  reforms,  Cambodia\u2019s  progress  toward  achieving  the \ntargets established in the results framework for the program cluster, and the need to conform to \nthe  overall  financing  requirement  during  the  country  program  and  strategy  period.                  \nThe estimated long-term benefits of the program would far exceed the loan amount.  ADB staff \nestimate11 that the total long term static benefits of the cluster program would be in the vicinity \nof $350.9 million or 3.6% of gross domestic product, highlighting the importance of finance \nsector reforms to the economy. The policy adjustment costs to the Government, statutory \nagencies,  banks  and  financial  institutions  are  conservatively  estimated  at  $53.0  million \n(compared to $45.3 million equivalent for FSP II of which $15 million is for subprogram 4). \nThese include the investment, administrative, enforcement and fiscal costs to the Government \nin implementing and enforcing the reforms (estimated at a minimum of $30.5 million).  The \npolicy adjustment costs also include the investment, administrative, and increased business \ncosts borne by banks and financial institutions for complying with the reforms (estimated at a \nminimum of $22.5 million). The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon satisfactory \ncompletion of all tranche conditions and following loan effectiveness. The proceeds of the \nprogram loan will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB's Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. 12 Subprogram 4 will \nprovide retroactive financing for eligible expenditures incurred up to 180 days prior to loan and \ngrant effectiveness. ADB will retain the right to audit the use of the loan and grant proceeds and \nto verify the accuracy of withdrawal application certification. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  The NBC will be the executing agency, and the MEF and MOC will be the implementing \nagencies for subprogram 4. The finance sector steering committee will continue to coordinate \nprogram implementation among government ministries, agencies, and development partners. \nTo ensure timely program implementation, the committee, comprising senior officers from the \nMEF, MOC, and NBC, will meet as required to review progress reports from the technical \nworking group, consider pending issues, and propose concrete actions to resolve those issues. \nA senior NBC officer has been appointed as program director to assist the MEF, MOC, and \nNBC  in  coordinating  the  day-to-day  program  and  post-program  partnership  framework \nimplementation. The program director will be required to submit to ADB quarterly progress \nreports  on  subprogram  4  and  post-program  partnership  framework  implementation  and  a \nprogram completion report within 6 months after the closing date of the loan. \n \n \n                                                 \n10   ADB. 2010.

The  policy-based  program  will  generate  economic  gains  through  the  successful \nimplementation of the overall policy actions (footnote 11). The immediate benefits include new \nand increased loans totaling $1.52 billion (15% of gross domestic product), the creation of \n12,100 new jobs, and the opening of 983 new branches of banks and MFIs since 2006.13       \nThe loan and grant proceeds will provide direct budget support to help defray the costs incurred \nby the government in implementing the program. \n \nB.  Governance \n28.  An assessment of the country\u2019s public financial management systems was carried out to \nbetter  understand  the  fiduciary  risks  and  determine  appropriate  fiduciary  arrangements  for \nsubprogram  4.  Discussions  were  held  with  the  government  during  implementation  of \nsubprogram 4 on the funds flow from the NBC to MEF and the contribution of the ongoing public \nfinancial  management  reform  program 14   to  the  administration  of  loan  proceeds. 15                        \nThe government continues to place significant emphasis on strengthening the overall public \nfinancial management system, internal control systems, and the functions of the National Audit \nAuthority, which have helped lower the fiduciary risk of the public financial management system \nas a whole. Subprogram 4 includes measures to (i) improve the management information \nsystem and reporting standards within the NBC, banks, insurance firms, and MFIs; (ii) promote \ntransparency of information released by banks, MFIs, and insurance firms; (iii) establish a credit \nbureau;  (iv)  support  implementation  of  anti-money-laundering  regulations;  and  (v)  deter \nactivities that could support the financing of terrorism. Satisfactory progress has been noted in \nrevenue collections, with greater use of the banking system to streamline revenue collection and \npayments processes. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, the government will institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, Gender, and Environmental Safeguards \n30.  Subprogram  4  of  the  FSP  II  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  have  a \nnegative  impact  on  indigenous  people  or  the  environment.  It  is  classified  category  C  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  impact  on  indigenous  people,  and  impact  on  the  environment. \nSubprogram 4 of the FSP II is a general intervention aimed at supporting sustainable economic \ngrowth. In that respect, it is expected to have an indirect positive effect on poverty reduction. \nWhile the implementation of reform measures have been gender neutral, the NBC reported that \n                                                 \n13  Contribution to the ADB Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  ADB. 2008.

Phnom Penh. \n ", "10 \nlending by MFIs to women has risen from 21% of total loans in 2002 to 76% in 2006 and 78% in \nMarch 2010; therefore subprogram 4 has been categorized as having some gender benefits. \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Subprogram  4  of  the  FSP  II  assumes  continuing  political  stability  and  overall \nmacroeconomic  recovery  from  the  global  economic  shock  over  the  medium  term. \nImplementation of subprogram 4 could face a number of risks, however, for which mitigation \nmeasures have been put in place (risk assessment and risk management plan).16 With the \ndesign safeguards, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to far outweigh any costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n32.  The government and the NBC have assured ADB that the implementation of the FSP II \ncluster shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the program loan and grant documents. In addition, the government has \ngiven the following specific assurances, which will be incorporated into the financing agreement: \nthe  government  will  (i)  continue  timely  policy  dialogue  on  a  regular  basis  with  ADB  on \nmacroeconomic policies and constraints; (ii) keep ADB informed of policy discussions with other \nmultilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for the implementation of subprogram \n4, the post-program partnership framework, and the overall program cluster; and (iii) provide \nADB with an opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. The government will \ntake ADB\u2019s views into consideration before finalizing and implementing any such proposals. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n33.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend that  the Board approve \n   \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR6,426,000 to the Kingdom of \nCambodia  for  subprogram  4  of  the  Financial  Sector  Program  II  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft financing agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $5,000,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources for subprogram 4 of the Financial Sector Program II, on \nterms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident  \n \n10 November 2010 \n                                                 \n16    Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORKa \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Achievements of FSP  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  II to date  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact        Assumptions \nA sound,  Increased ratio of M2 to  M2 to GDP reached  National accounts,  Continuing political \nmarket-based  GDP of 29.0% or above by  36.7% in June 2010   economic reports, and  stability \nfinance sector  2011, from 20.5% in 2006    official statistics of the \nOverall \nthat enhances      government, and other \nmacroeconomic \nfinancial      international \nrecovery from \nresource      development agencies \nglobal economic \nmobilization        \nshock \n  Total private sector credit  Total private sector  Annual reports, including \nof banks to GDP of 24.0%  credit reached 24.9%  audited financial reports   \nor above by 2011, from  in June 2010.
