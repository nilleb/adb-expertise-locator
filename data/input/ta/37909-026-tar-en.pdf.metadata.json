Since being launched in 2003, ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program (TFP) has supported $30.7 \nbillion in trade and mobilized $18.2 billion in cofinancing. The TFP conducts approximately 100 \ndue diligence and annual reviews per year, enabling it to provide guarantees and loans through \npartner banks. This closes market gaps for trade finance and supports more trade, leading to \neconomic growth and job creation. Information from due diligence and annual reviews will enable \nTFP to share knowledge that will help attract cofinancing and international investment in DMCs, \nthereby closing trade finance market gaps.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n2.  This is the first subproject under the Due Diligence and Capacity Development for Trade \nFinance Program Banks. \n \nB.  Subproject Scope  \n3.  Subproject 1 will provide the TFP with funding to conduct due diligence on partner banks \nand financial institutions. Financial analysts will be engaged through a firm from 2018 to 2019 to \nwork with the TFP to conduct due diligence and ongoing annual reviews of participating banks \nand partner financial institutions. Subproject 1 will also include capacity building through in- \ncountry seminars and trainings.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities  \n4.  Output 1: Capacity to provide trade finance and guarantees by developing member \ncountry  banks  enhanced.  Assessments  of  new  and  existing  banks  and  partner  financial \ninstitutions will be conducted under the TA by consultants who will support TFP relationship \nmanagers (ADB international staff). Due diligence on banks will enable ADB to identify and \ncharacterize any gaps in the financial and technical capacity of individual banks that would inhibit \nthe provision and/or increase of trade finance credit lines.1 DMC banks are targeted based on a \nmarket survey conducted by the TFP. If there is market demand for TFP guarantees on a \nparticular DMC bank, the bank will be targeted for due diligence and inclusion into the program.2 \nThe due diligence results will be included in credit applications to establish or maintain TFP credit \nlines for participating banks.   \n \n5.  Output 2:  In-country seminars and trainings conducted. The TFP provides post-due \ndiligence feedback to DMC banks to identify weaknesses and improvement benchmarks. This \ncapacity development will help strengthen DMC banks and improve their ability to attract credit \nlines to support trade from international financial institutions. This will ultimately benefit importers \nand exporters by increasing their opportunities to access trade finance, allowing them to expand \ntheir business operations, and thereby create jobs and reduce poverty. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA will coordinate with the TFP to target banks where there is market demand for capacity development. \n2  Notwithstanding current market demand, the TFP will likewise support further expansion to Group A countries \nincluding banks in Myanmar and the Pacific region (e.g., Samoa, Vanuatu, and possibly the Marshall Islands). \n ", "2   \n6.  Information regarding the adequacy of the financial and technical capacity of individual \nbanks will be confidentially conveyed to those banks. More general information about trade \nfinance operations will be disseminated through in-country seminars to which DMC banks, \nexporters, government officials,  and  international  banks  may  be  invited.  The  seminars  are \nexpected to cover (i) key concepts and processes in trade finance, (ii) essential elements in \ndeveloping and marketing trade finance products and services, (iii) payment and risk categories, \n(iv)  risk  analysis  of  trade  finance  products,  (v)  fundamentals  of  documentary  credits,  (vi) \nenvironment and safeguards guidelines as applied to TFP transactions, and (vii) de-risking and \nanti-money laundering compliance methods. The TA will also be used to fund regional seminars \nand other TFP training events, as well as an annual networking event, which will bring together \ninternational and local DMC banks and seek to increase private sector engagement with DMCs. \n \n7.  Activities will include the following: \n \n(i)  work with individual banks to acquire financial data; \n(ii)  analyze the financial information through financial, ratio, gap, and other analyses; \n(iii)  conduct onsite due diligence on banks; \n(iv)  assess the trade finance operations capacity of selected banks and make \nrecommendations for improvement; \n(v)  draft credit applications, risk ratings, and financial due diligence reports; \n(vi)  conduct integrity due diligence and reviews, including monitoring and following \nup on recommendations for improvement; \n(vii)  conduct due diligence and financial assessments on TFP banks with a view to \nexpanding and leveraging the TFP to include additional ADB financial products; \n(viii)  conduct a banking sector analysis for each DMC; \n(ix)  conduct signing ceremonies with new partner banks;  \n(x)  deliver trade finance training;  \n(xi)  support initiatives related to knowledge- sharing important to closing trade \nfinance gaps; and \n(xii)  conduct knowledge-sharing, and partnership-development activities (including \ntraining seminars for DMC banks and regional training and/or networking events). \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n8.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $3,200,000 which will be funded by TASF-6. The \nfunds will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem for international consultants, conference \nrelated expenditures, and miscellaneous expenses. \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n9.  ADB will administer the subproject. PSOD will select, supervise and evaluate consultants \nas well as resource persons that will be engaged for TFP seminars and trainings. \n \nTable 1: Subproject Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  April 2018\u2013March 2019 \nperiod \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nImplementing agencies  Asian Development Bank \n ", "  3 \nAspects   Arrangements \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nDue diligence and  Firm; Resource Person  ADB, Subproject 1  \nfinancial analysis experts;  Selection \nresource persons \nAdvance contracting  Selection 141529: TA 37909-026 REG: Due Diligence and Capacity Development of \nTrade Finance Program Banks (Subproject 1) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n10.
