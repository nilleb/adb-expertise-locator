INTRODUCTION \n1.   During  the  2011  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening the Stress Testing Capacity of the \nBanking System. After consultations with the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) \nand other stakeholders from 5\u20137 November 2012, a TA fact-finding mission from 28\u201330 January \n2013 agreed with the government on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, \ncosts, and terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In the context of following a moderately loose monetary policy, the PRC\u2019s banking \ninstitutions increased credit extension in 2009 and 2010 after the 2008 global financial crisis. \nHowever, the annual growth rate of total assets was modest at 18.0% in 2012, after peaking at \n25.9% in 2009. The other three key ratios for commercial banks also improved\u2014nonperforming \nloans registered at 1.0% in 2012, capital adequacy at 13.3%, and return on equity at 19.9%, \ncompared with 2.4%, 12.2%, 17.5%, respectively in 2010. Many regard the PRC banking sector \nas stable despite the fallout of the global financial crisis. This can primarily be attributed to the \nCBRC and the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC), which instituted stronger risk-based supervision \nand effective monetary policies to mitigate and prevent, to the extent possible, the adverse \nimpact of the global financial crisis on the PRC\u2019s banking sector.2   \n \n3.  Despite the positive assessment of the PRC\u2019s banking sector, some areas of concern \nhave  been  noted.  They  include  an  increasing  nonperforming  loan  ratio  in  export-oriented \neastern coastal provinces and potential risks as a result of the global economic slowdown; \npotential risks attributable to the rapid growth of real estate loans, local-government-financing \nplatform loans, shadow banking system credit flows, and off-balance sheet exposures; and, in \nthe long term, adverse impacts of financial reforms, especially further liberalization of interest \nrates on commercial banks and the opening-up of the banking sector. \n \n4.  The  PRC\u2019s  banking  sector  needs  to  rise  to  critical  challenges.  Some  fundamental \nsystems and mechanisms for promoting banking system stability have yet to be put in place in \nterms  of  market  discipline,  innovation,  cross-sector  operations,  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprise and rural financing, micro- and macroprudential regulation, deposit insurance, and \nfailed bank resolution.3 However, progress is being made in operationalizing critical measures in \nthe sector's financial regulation system to support financial stability. The CBRC has introduced, \namong other things, a national capital regulatory framework along with Basel II and III, dynamic \nprovisioning requirements, and a leverage ratio. PBC, on the other hand, established a system \nfor monitoring and assessing regional financial stability. It undertakes extensive monitoring of \nthe inherent risks in the financial industry, and pays particular attention to the cross-border \ncontagion risk from overseas financial institutions.  \n \n5.  Having  issued  the  new  capital  regulatory  framework in  2012,  the  CBRC  aims  to \nimplement Basel II and III requirements at the same time for all commercial banks from January \n2013,  and pillar  II  of  the  new  framework  requires  stress  testing.  Stress  testing  involves \nestimating financial and other impacts from hypothetical changes in the risk environment and is \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 February 2013.   \n2  PBC. 2012.

It plays a particularly important \nrole  in  providing  forward-looking  assessments  of  risk,  supporting  internal  and  external \ncommunications, and facilitating the development of risk mitigation or contingency plans for \nstressed conditions.4 The global financial crisis has significantly increased the focus on stress \ntesting.  Financial  institutions  and  their  prudential  regulators  have  been  undertaking  stress \ntesting as part of their normal risk management processes.5 The CBRC has issued various \nguidelines requiring commercial banks to conduct stress tests and provided necessary guidance, \nincluding  a  Guidance  on  Commercial  Banks\u2019  Stress  Testing  (2007).  The  CBRC  and  PBC \nconducted  a  stress  testing  exercise  covering  17  major  commercial  banks,  as  part  of  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund/World  Bank  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program  in  2011.6 \nBuilding on this experience, the CBRC is pursuing advanced stress testing techniques and \napplication for itself as well as commercial banks. Strengthening the capacity for stress testing \nis included in the CBRC\u2019s 22 key tasks for 2013.  \n \n6.  The  PRC\u2019s  12th  five-year  plan7 for  financial  sector  development  and  reform8 also \nemphasized the importance of strengthening bank risk management. As part of the provision of \nknowledge solutions committed to in the country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015, the TA will \nstrengthen the CBRC\u2019s institutional capacity for stress testing, enabling it to better recognize the \nweaknesses in the banking industry and to maintain a stable banking system.9 A stable banking \nsystem is the fundamental element of innovative financing solutions and the improvement of \nfinancial availability in the priority sectors. By placing a higher priority on small and medium-\nsized banks\u2019 capacity building, the TA will also contribute to protecting the poor, who are \nvulnerable to financial and economic cycles. It is included in the 2013 indicative assistance \npipeline for non-lending products and services of the PRC Country Operations Business Plan, \n2012\u20132014.10 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be a healthier banking system. The attainment of this impact \nwill be demonstrated through an increase in the risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio of the \nbanking system. The key outcome of the TA will be the stress testing framework used as an \nintegral part of forward-looking risk management by commercial banks, as well as for micro and \nmacro prudential supervision by the CBRC.  \n \n                                                \n4 Standards  Implementation  Group  of  the  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision.  2012.

The TA will assist the CBRC in improving the stress test operational environment and \nstrengthening the stress test capacity of the CBRC and commercial banks, and help conduct \nstress tests. An inception workshop will be held with the executing agency, researchers, and \nother key stakeholders to discuss the feasibility and viability of the TA implementation plan. The \nfoundation of stress testing will be strengthened and training will be provided. The TA will also \nassist the CBRC to carry out actual stress tests with advanced techniques and apply the results \nto risk management of the banking sector. During implementation, various knowledge products \nwill be produced and workshops will be held, as appropriate, to disseminate information to \nstakeholders and discuss the TA\u2019s implementation progress. \n \n9.  The TA\u2019s outputs are a new stress test operational environment, in-depth stress test \ntraining, and stress tests by the CBRC. \n(i)  New  stress  test  operational  environment.  The  TA  will  help  the  CBRC \n(a) establish a stress testing unit comprising a wide range of senior experts to \nprepare  a  white  paper  and  a  new  Guidance  on  Commercial  Banks\u2019  Stress \nTesting to be adopted by the CBRC and (b) strengthen the databases of the \nCBRC and commercial banks to reflect the recommendations of the International \nMonetary Fund and the World Bank after the stress testing exercise in 2011. \n(ii)  In-depth stress test training. This includes producing technical instructions on \nthe  implementation  and  application  of  stress  testing  by  the  CBRC  and \ncommercial banks. The TA will provide training sessions of about 3\u20134 days per \ncycle (5 cycles in total) to accommodate over 400 CBRC regulators, and one \ncycle of training for 40 risk managers of large banks. Small and medium-sized \nbank  managers  will  be  given  special  focus,  but  the  actual  training  will  be \nconducted by trainees of larger banks, with the CBRC\u2019s support.11 The training \nwill be designed at different levels of complexity, covering the state-owned and \njoint-stock banks, the city commercial banks, and the rural commercial banks. \nTechnical instructions, mainly focusing on commercial banks\u2019 stress testing and \nthe CBRC supervisors\u2019 assessment of commercial banks\u2019 stress testing, and \ntraining materials for both the CBRC and commercial banks (e.g., manual and \naudiovisual materials) will be produced and disseminated. International study \nvisits  will  be  organized  to  learn  from  the  experiences  of  other  countries  in \ndesigning, conducting, and utilizing stress testing. \n(iii)  The China Banking Regulatory Commission\u2019s stress tests. The TA will help \nthe CBRC design and conduct stress tests. After developing stress test models, \nthe CBRC will conduct a \u201ctop-down\u201d stress test for macroprudential regulation \nthat relates to certain macroeconomic risk factors,12 and a reverse stress test for \nthe PRC banking sector. The TA will prepare a policy brief with recommendations \nfor macroprudential regulation. \n \n                                                \n11The  comprehensive  training  program  will  include  sessions  for  training  of  trainers.  The  training  will  also \naccommodate practices for stress testing associated with relatively more advanced countries, which were listed by \nthe Standards Implementation Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The proposed training \nmodality would be reviewed during TA implementation.  \n12 The stress test will include a scenario analysis, which involves changing multiple risk parameters simultaneously. \nThis often applies adverse historical or worst-case forecast outcomes to existing financial soundness indicators to \nunderstand the deterioration or other impact that may result.  \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The CBRC, the \nexecuting agency, will finance trainees\u2019 participation, and provide counterpart support in the \nform of counterpart staff, office space, domestic transportation, secretarial assistance, and other \nin-kind  contributions.  The  CBRC  will  also  arrange  meetings  between  the  consultants  and \nrelevant agencies and organizations. The value of CBRC contribution is estimated to account \nfor 33% of the total TA cost. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The CBRC will be the executing agency. It will form a stress testing unit, which will \nengage the Statistics Department and other departments concerned, and be chaired by the \ndirector general of the Statistics Department. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, from 1 June 2013 to 30 November 2014, \nand will require 6.0 person-months of international consulting services, and 22.5 person-months \nof national consulting services (all stress test experts in various subareas) for a total cost of \n$305,000. The  consultants  will  submit to  both the  CBRC  and  ADB (i)  an  inception report \n2 weeks  after  services  start,  (ii)  a  progress  report  at  an  appropriate  stage  during  TA \nimplementation, (iii) a draft final report before the conclusion of the contract, and (iv) the final \nreport  2  weeks  after  receiving  comments  from  the  CBRC  and  ADB.  All  reports  must  be \nsubmitted in English and Chinese. The consultants will also deliver the draft new Guidance on \nCommercial  Banks\u2019  Stress  Testing,  technical  instructions  for  stress  testing  and  training \nmaterials, the CBRC\u2019s stress test report, and, as knowledge papers, a white paper for the above \nguidance and a policy brief. The consultants will be individually engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The CBRC may use an advance payment facility to conduct workshops and \ntraining.   \n \n13.  The CBRC will regularly monitor and report on major project activities, as will ADB \nreview missions. Consultants\u2019 reports will be presented at workshops and seminars organized to \nvalidate findings. Reports will be made available on ADB's website in English and Chinese and \npublished in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011). \n \nIV.
