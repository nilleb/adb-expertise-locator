The program focused primarily on\nnonfinancial  enterprises.  While  there  is  greater  awareness  of\ncorporate  governance  issues  now,  poor  corporate  governance\npractices  and  weak  operational  and  financial  performance  of\nenterprises, however, remain as endemic problems in the country,\nand affect the viability of large joint-stock companies (JSCs), state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs), and banks. Common problems include\nweak  internal  governance,  lack  of  disclosure  and  transparency,\ncontinuing use of the old Soviet-type accounting and asset valuation\nstandards,  and  constraints  on  skills  for  effectively  monitoring  and\nenforcing  the  existing  legal  and  regulatory  provisions.  These\nconstraints,  in  combination  with  the  overall  poor  macroeconomic\nenvironment, have rendered a large number of enterprises insolvent\nand  nonviable.  Compounding  these  problems  is  a  weak  judicial\nsystem, which suffers from inefficient and time-consuming procedures\nand  lacks  finality  and  transparency  in  its  processes.  Judges  lack\nindependence and legal training. Furthermore, public and investor\nperception of significant corruption, as reported in various studies,\nhas eroded confidence in the judiciary.\nTo address these problems and attract domestic and foreign private\ninvestments,  which  are  critical  given  the  fiscal  constraints,  the\nGovernment needs to launch deeper reforms building on the lessons\nlearned  from  CGERP  and  focusing  on  (i)  strengthening  the  legal\nframework  for  corporate  and  banking  sector  governance;\n(ii) improving  enforcement;  (iii)  going  beyond  judicial  training  to\naddress judicial sector weaknesses; and (iv) strengthening the policy\nframework  for  resolution  of  weak  enterprises,  without  relying\nexclusively on insolvency procedures initiated by creditors.\nObjective and Scope Building on CGERP, CGERP-II aims to enhance investor confidence\nby strengthening corporate, financial, and judicial governance and\ntaking steps to improve the efficiency and viability of the enterprise\nsector.    To  achieve  this  objective,  the  Program  will  (i) promote,\nstrengthen, and implement good corporate governance by developing\n                                        \n1 Loan 1546-KGZ (SF): Corporate Governance and Enterprise Reform Program (CGERP), for $40 million equivalent,\napproved on 25 September 1997.", "iii\npolicy, legal, and monitoring frameworks; (ii) introduce international\naccounting,  auditing,  and  valuation  standards;  (iii)  strengthen\ngovernance of commercial banks and the legal framework to protect\ncreditors' rights; (iv) launch legal and judicial reforms to establish\narbitration as a mechanism for resolving commercial disputes, and\nstreamline  judicial  processes  and  procedures;  and  (v)  facilitate\nexpedient resolution of weak enterprises.\nIn promoting and strengthening corporate governance, the Program\nwill enhance the capacity to implement and monitor good governance\nmeasures, adopt a sound legal framework for JSCs, and improve the\ncorporate governance and policy framework for SOEs. Concurrently,\nsteps will be taken to harmonize national accounting and auditing\nstandards with corresponding international standards, and formulate\nasset valuation standards. In addition, the Program will strengthen\ngovernance in the banking sector by developing sound criteria for key\nappointments  in  banks,  improving  the  regulatory  framework  to\nsupport restitution and retribution for insider abuses, and facilitating\nswift resolution of banking sector insolvency. Finally, the legal and\nenforcement framework will be strengthened to protect creditors' and\npledge-holders' rights.\nIn the judicial sector, the Program seeks to provide an institutional\nframework  that  will  facilitate  greater  understanding  of  judicial\nweaknesses  and  implementation  of  initial  reform  measures.  The\nProgram has supported the establishment of a Consultative Judicial\nReform Group (CJRG) under the President of the Kyrgyz Republic to\naddress  process-related  and  systemic  weaknesses  in  the  legal\nframework and the judiciary. The President has endorsed CJRG's\nrecommendations  to  (i)  introduce  commercial  arbitration,\n(ii) streamline court appellate procedures, and (iii) enhance judicial\nindependence. To promote enterprise governance and restructuring,\nCGERP-II  supports  commercial  arbitration,  streamlining  the  court\nappeals process and enhancing transparency, and establishment of a\nJudicial  Advisory  Commission  (JAC)  to  undertake  an  in-depth\ndiagnostic assessment of judicial sector constraints. The JAC will\nformulate  wide-ranging  short-and  longer-term  reform  measures  to\nimprove  the  quality,  transparency,  and  efficiency  of  the  judicial\nsystem  in  line  with  the  recommendations  of  the  CJRG  and\ncomprehensive development framework (CDF) Reports.\nThe  Program  will  also  facilitate  expedient  resolution  of  weak\nenterprises by formulating an industry sector reform strategy, and\nsupporting  liquidation  and  other  resolution  measures  for  a  limited\nnumber  of  weak  and  nonviable  enterprises.  In  addition,  policy\nmeasures  will  be  implemented  to  mitigate  the  adverse  impact  of\nenterprise restructuring.\nClassification Economic growth", "iv\nEnvironmental Category  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed,  and  no\nAssessment significant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\nThe ADB Loan\nLoan  Amount  It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) support the\nand Terms Government's policy reforms by providing a loan of SDR27,398,000\n($35 million equivalent) from ADB's Special Funds resources. The\nloan will have a 24-year maturity including an 8-year grace period,\nand will carry an annual interest charge of 1 percent during the grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent thereafter.\nProgram Period The Program period is 3.5 years, from January 2001 to June 2004.\nand Tranching The loan will be released in two equal tranches. The first tranche will\nbe made available upon loan effectiveness. The second tranche is\nexpected to be released by September 2003, subject to satisfactory\nimplementation of the program conditions.\nExecuting  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency for the Program,\nAgency and will be responsible for effective administration and disbursement\nof  the  loan  proceeds  and  proper  maintenance  of  records.  The\nCorporate Development Center (CDC) in the Prime Minister's Office\n(PMO) will be the Implementing Agency for the overall Program. The\nCDC  will  report  to  an  interministerial  Consultative  Council,  to  be\nchaired  by  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  chief  of  staff,  to  steer  the\nimplementation of the Program. Key ministries and agencies will also\nnominate staff to work for 18 months on the implementation of the\nProgram. The judicial component of the Program will be overseen by\nthe Judicial Reform Monitoring Group (JRMG), headed by the chief of\nstaff of the President's Administration and comprising the Minister of\nJustice and the heads of the legal departments of the PMO and the\nPresident's Administration.\nProcurement The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs\nof items produced and procured in ADB member countries (other than\nitems specified in the negative list and imports financed by other\nbilateral and multilateral agencies). The Government will certify that\nthe volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB's projected\ndisbursements under the loan for the given period. ADB reserves the\nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of\nthe Government's certification.\nCounterpart  The Program includes specific components that bear distinct costs of\nFunds structural adjustments. The counterpart funds to be generated out of\nthe loan proceeds will be used to finance the cost of such structural\nadjustments and high-priority development projects.\nTechnical Assistance The  objective  of  the  advisory  TA,  amounting  to  $850,000,  is  to\nstrengthen corporate governance and support judicial reforms in the\nKyrgyz Republic. It will focus on (i) promotion and effective monitoring\nof good governance norms in all enterprises, (ii) adoption of modern\naccounting and asset valuation methods in large enterprises, and", "v\n(iii) reforming judicial procedures and processes. The CDC will be the\nExecuting  Agency  for  the  TA,  which  will  be  implemented  over\n15 months  starting  in  April  2002.  It  is  estimated  that  the  TA  will\nrequire 20.5 person-months of international and 75 person-months of\ndomestic  consulting  support.  All  consultants  will  be  selected  in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB.\nRisks and Safeguards The Program faces three major risks. First, given the small market\nsize  and  the  continuing  dependence  of  the  Kyrgyz  economy  on\nRussia, macroeconomic stability is critical to ensure that structural\nreforms proceed in an uninterrupted manner across the corporate,\nfinancial, and other sectors of the economy. Recognizing this, the\nGovernment, with the support of the International Monetary Fund,\ncontinues  to  stress  adherence  to  a  macroeconomic  stabilization\nprogram, with emphasis on improving fiscal, monetary, and external\ndebt  management.  The  Government  is  also  pursing  a  multifold\nstrategy to reduce debt, including pursuing a tight fiscal policy and\nreducing the public investment program (PIP).\nThe second risk facing the Program pertains to the resolution of weak\nenterprises.  While  there  are  significant  enterprise-level  vested\ninterests  that  could  prevent  reorganization  or  liquidation,  the\nGovernment  fully  recognizes  the  extent  of  nonviability  facing  the\nindustry  sector.  The  Program  proposes  a  gradual,  phased-in\napproach  to  resolution,  which  involves  a  sequence  of  measures,\nincluding management change, reorganization and liquidation among\nothers, to enable the Government to explore all plausible avenues\nand assure the stakeholders in the process.\nThird, because legal and judicial reforms are politically sensitive and\nprone to resistance from vested interests, they may not be effectively\nimplemented.  Given  the  weaknesses  in  the  legal  framework,  the\nProgram requires amendments to several laws. Some of the critical\njudicial  reform  measures  require  technical  amendments  to  the\nConstitution of the Kyrgyz Republic. ADB has provided significant TA\nsupport to amendments to legislation. In light of its stated goal to\nachieve foreign direct investment of 15 percent of gross domestic\nproduct  by  2010,  the  President  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the\nGovernment are committed to strengthen the legal framework and\nattract investors. To initiate judicial reforms, ADB has closely worked\nwith the Government to establish the CJRG under the President. The\nPresident  has  subsequently  endorsed  the  CJRG's  report,  which\nrecommends  wide-ranging  reforms  in  the  judiciary,  including\namendments to existing legislation to achieve those reforms. A sound\nimplementation  framework  has  also  been  agreed  upon  with  the\nGovernment, including the establishment of the JAC to undertake an\nin-depth  diagnostic  assessment  of  the  judicial  problems,  and  an\ninstitutional mechanism to draft the required legal amendments.", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Second Phase of the Corporate Governance and Enterprise\nReform  Program  (CGERP-II).  The  report  also  outlines  proposed  technical  assistance  for\nStrengthening  Corporate  Governance  and  Judicial  Reforms,  and  if  the  proposed  loan  is\napproved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall\napprove the technical assistance.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The Kyrgyz Republic has introduced major reforms in many areas of economic policy\nformulation: introducing the national currency (som) soon after independence, shifting from\nmonobanking to the current two-tier banking system with the swift establishment of a central\nbank, privatizing enterprises, liberalizing trade, and formulating a basic legal and regulatory\nframework to guide the transition to a market economy. Despite these structural reforms, the\neconomy has remained susceptible to exogenous shocks, given its landlocked geography with\nlimited natural resources, and high degree of dependence on countries of the former Soviet\nUnion (FSU) for trade. The external shocks, together with an inefficient and narrow industrial\nbase and a nascent financial sector, have introduced a high degree of economic vulnerabilities.\nFurther, while broad-based reforms have been supported early on, progress in some key areas\nsuch as privatization and judicial reforms has only been gradual.\n3. Recognizing the weaknesses in the real and financial sectors, the Government has\nfocused its recent reform initiatives on (i) strengthening corporate governance in enterprises,\n(ii) improving the legal framework for enterprise restructuring, and (iii) strengthening the banking\nand  nonbank  financial  sectors.  Supporting  these  endeavors,  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) approved the Corporate Governance and Enterprise Reform Program (CGERP) in 19971\nand the Financial Intermediation and Resource Mobilization (FIRM) Program in 1999.2 CGERP\nand the FIRM Program have supplemented and complemented the overall structural reforms\nthat the Government has undertaken with support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nand the World Bank (WB). CGERP aimed to improve the efficiency and performance of private\nenterprises and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to make them viable in a competitive market-\nbased  environment.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the  program  undertook  to  (i) develop  and\nimplement guidelines for best practices in corporate governance, (ii) eliminate subsidized loans\nfrom the budget to all SOEs, (iii) improve the legal framework for insolvency procedures, and\n(iv) strengthen institutional capacity in these areas. It also helped establish the Corporate\nDevelopment Center (CDC), the first of its kind in transition economies, with the mandate of\nassisting enterprises in corporate governance, management, marketing, and finance.\n4. The FIRM Program helped contain the impact of the 1998 Russian financial crisis on the\nbanking system. The program focused on improving the efficiency of financial intermediation by\npromoting a sound, well-functioning, and resilient banking system and enhancing the role of\ncapital markets. It supported the formulation and implementation of an enabling policy, and an\noperational and regulatory framework, and undertook to (i) resolve problem banks; (ii) improve\n                                        \n1  Loan 1546-KGZ (SF): Corporate Governance and Enterprise Reform Program, for $40 million equivalent, approved\non 25 September 1997, and implemented over 1997-1999. TA Loan 1547-KGZ(SF): Capacity Building in Corporate\nGovernance, for $4 million, was approved concurrently.\n2  Loan 1723-KGZ (SF): Financial Intermediation and Resource Mobilization Program, for $35 million equivalent,\napproved on 19 December 1999, and currently being implemented. TA Loan 1724-KGZ (SF): Commercial Bank\nAudits, for $1 million equivalent, was approved concurrently.", "2\nprudential norms and strengthen their implementation, through stringent on-site and off-site\nmonitoring of emerging problems in weak banks, (iii) enhance financial transparency in banks,\n(iv) rationalize the public debt management and guarantee process, and (v) develop nonbank\nfinancial institutions.\n5. However, given the transitional environment and the related macroeconomic constraints,\nseveral weaknesses in corporate and financial governance remain, particularly in large joint-\nstock  companies  (JSCs),  SOEs,  and  banks.  The  weaknesses  include  generic  internal\ngovernance problems at the firm level, lack of protection for minority shareholders\u2019 rights in\nmany JSCs and SOEs, continuing use of the old Soviet-type accounting and asset valuation\nstandards,  and  capacity  and  skills  constraints  for  effectively  monitoring  and  enforcing  the\nexisting  legal  and  regulatory  provisions  in  JSCs.  In  addition,  the  weak  macroeconomic\nenvironment in the first few years of the transition and in the aftermath of the Russian financial\ncrisis rendered a large number of enterprises nonviable, and a weak judicial system complicated\ntheir satisfactory resolution and liquidation. Specifically, the judiciary lacks independence, and\nthe judicial processes and procedures are inefficient and time-consuming, and lack clarity and\ntransparency. Judges lack specialized training, but the extent of problems within the judiciary\nindicates that provision of training alone will not be meaningful without wide-ranging judicial\nreforms. The prevalence of insider abuses in some commercial banks and reported political\ninterference, combined with a weak and inefficient judiciary, have affected the internal corporate\ngovernance of commercial banks.\n6. Given these weaknesses and structural constraints, the Government requested ADB's\nsupport to (i) further strengthen corporate governance in all enterprises and banks through\nimprovements in the legal framework and enforcement of governance standards, (ii) undertake\nlegal and judicial sector reforms to enhance public and investor confidence, and (iii) facilitate\nexpedient resolution of industry sector problems. To meet this request, ADB approved a project\npreparatory technical assistance (TA) amounting to $700,000 in September 2000.3 As part of\nthe  preparatory  process,  a  Reconnaissance  Mission  (November  2000)  and  a  Fact-Finding\nMission (March-April 2001) formulated the objectives and scope of CGERP-II (the Program),\nand understanding reached with the Government was confirmed by an Appraisal Mission (June-\nJuly 2001) and a Policy Consultation Mission (August 2001).4 The Program also incorporates\nthe lessons learned from the implementation of CGERP, FIRM, and other economic and sector\nwork  in  support  of  these  programs.  The  Government's  commitment  is  recorded  in  the\ndevelopment policy letter in Appendix 1. The policy matrix for the Program is in Appendix 2 and\nthe program framework is in Appendix 3.\nIII. THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA.   Government\u2019s Development Objectives, Strategy and Plans\n7. In  the  10  years  since  its  independence  from  the  FSU,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  has\nimplemented broad-ranging reforms in agriculture, trade, and industry. Most price controls were\nremoved as early as in 1992. Export and import licensing requirements were lifted in 1994. The\nKyrgyz som became fully convertible in 1995, and the Kyrgyz Republic joined the World Trade\n                                        \n3  TA 3505-KGZ: Preparation of the Second Phase of the Corporate Governance and Enterprise Reform Program, for\n$700,000, approved on 28 September 2000.\n4  The Appraisal Mission comprised R. Subramaniam, Mission Leader, Financial Economist; J. Boestel, Economist; L.\nRaquipiso, Associate Economic Analyst; and S. Tamondong, Poverty Reduction Coordinator. S. Akhtar, Manager,\nIEFI; R. Clendon, Senior Counsel; and R. Subramaniam, participated in the Policy Consultation Mission, and the\nResident Representative, Kyrgyz Resident Mission, provided support throughout the processing.", "3\nOrganization in 1998. Since then, it has established one of the most liberal trade regimes\namong  the  Central  Asian  Republics  (CARs).  Significant  progress  was  also  achieved  in\nprivatizing small and medium-size enterprises in the first half of the 1990s. Introduction of\nmodern legislation on banking, bankruptcy, and other commercial areas has been faster than in\nthe neighboring transition countries. To solidify its own reform efforts, the Government has also\nlaunched  various  aid-supported  enterprise  and  financial  sector  reform  programs  aimed  at\nstrengthening  the  policy,  institutional,  and  regulatory  frameworks  governing  financial  and\nnonfinancial institutions.\n8. However, the Kyrgyz Republic is also one of the countries most adversely affected by\nthe transition. Its forward-looking reforms could not offset the adverse effects of a number of\nnegative factors. For instance, the highly specialized division of labor that existed across the\nFSU states made a large number of the country\u2019s enterprises obsolete and redundant after\nindependence.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  also  lost  access  to  heavily  subsidized  products  and\nmarkets, as it had traded commodities on very favorable terms with its neighbors prior to 1991.\nThe lack of natural resources relative to its neighbors and its landlocked nature have also been\nmajor constraints to sustained growth and diversification of the industrial structure.\n9. Real gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 50 percent in the first half of the\n1990s due to the recession induced by the transition. However, the broad-ranging economic\nliberalization  measures  adopted  started  yielding  results  by  1997,  when  economic  growth\nincreased to 10 percent per annum. The authorities simultaneously pursued a tight monetary\npolicy, which helped in containing inflation from 35 percent in 1996 to 14.7 percent in 1997. On\nthe external front, the current account deficit as a percent of GDP declined from 25 percent in\n1996 to 8 percent in 1997, and gross official reserves rose from the equivalent of 1.5 months of\nimports at the end of 1996 to 3 months of imports by the end of 1997. To sustain this growth\nperformance, the Government sought ADB's support to remove the constraints affecting the\nefficiency  and  performance  of  enterprises.  CGERP,  besides  introducing  modern  corporate\ngovernance norms, helped introduce hard budget constraints and transparent financial practices\nin SOEs, which helped in better accounting of enterprise-level arrears.\nB. Recent Economic Performance and Prospects\n10. The gains achieved through structural reforms were, however, reversed by the onset of\nthe Russian financial crisis in August 1998. Real GDP growth slowed down to 2.1 percent in\n1998, and the som depreciated by about 48 percent in nominal terms year-on-year by the end of\n1998, generating inflationary pressures, that pushed the inflation rate to 18.3 percent in 1998\nand further to 40 percent in 1999. The current account deficit as a percent of GDP again\nincreased to 22.3 percent in 1998. The sharp depreciation of the currency led to a crisis of\nconfidence in the Kyrgyz economy and a buildup of excessive interest rate pressures. The\nbanking  sector  was  particularly  affected,  as  loan  defaults  grew  due  to  unhedged  foreign\ncurrency liabilities of many borrowers and the hike in interest rates on credit to around 75\npercent in early 1999. Weak corporate governance and a significant buildup of nonperforming\nloans due to connected lending also exacerbated the banking sector problems. Erosion of\nconfidence led to a withdrawal of domestic currency deposits and their substitution with foreign\ncurrency deposits in the banking system.\n11. Over the last 18 months, however, the economy appears to be recovering from the\nadverse shock of the Russian crisis. 5 Real GDP grew at 5 percent in 2000, and the continued\n                                        \n5  See the Kyrgyz Republic: Country Economic Review Update circulated to the Board on 10 September 2001.", "4\npursuance of a tight monetary policy helped in lowering inflation to 9.6 percent.6 The overall\ncash  deficit  of  the  central  Government  declined  to  9.4  percent  of  GDP  in  2000,  down\n2.6 percentage points from the previous year. During the year the som depreciated only by\n6.3 percent against the US dollar. Exports grew by 10.4 percent over 1999, while imports fell by\n8.2 percent  due  to  cuts  in  the  public  investment  program  (PIP)  as  well  as  foreign  direct\ninvestment (FDI). As a result, the external current account deficit declined from 14.9 percent of\nGDP in 1999 to 6.8 percent of GDP in 2000. At the end of 2000, gross international reserves\nstood at 4.5 months of imports, relative to 2.5 months at the end of 1998. These positive\nmacroeconomic trends have continued in 2001, with real GDP growing at 6.7 percent during the\nfirst six months, inflation contained at 5.9 percent, and the som depreciating by a marginal\n0.5 percent. Import compression has continued, however, with imports declining by 14.7 percent\ndue to the declining PIP.\n12. To sustain the recovery and stabilize the economy, the Government adopted a fourfold\nmacroeconomic strategy to (i) strengthen fiscal management, which has been the weakest\ncomponent  in  the  overall  economic  policy  framework  due  to  revenue  constraints  and\nexpenditure pressures; (ii) strengthen external debt management in short and medium terms by\nrationalizing  and  downsizing  the  PIP;  (iii)  stabilize  the  banking  sector  and  enhance  public\nconfidence  in  the  domestic  currency;  and  (iv)  expedite  structural  reforms,  focusing  on\nprivatization of large enterprises and downsizing the public sector. Due to the fiscal pressures,\nthe budget deficit remains high, as tax revenue collections and expenditure management have\ndeteriorated. However, reforms are under way to strengthen tax collection and tighten public\nspending. The Government has adopted monthly financial plans and cash limits, in line with IMF\nstandards on fiscal transparency.\n13. Another major challenge facing the Government is the high level of external debt, which\nstood at $1.7 billion or 132 percent of GDP at the end of 2000, compared with virtually no\nexternal debt at the time of independence in 1991. Of that amount, $1.24 billion or 95 percent of\nGDP is Government guaranteed. Dependence on external assistance has grown to meet the\nlarge need for public investments for social and economic development, persistent fiscal deficits\nsince 1993, and a shortage of domestic savings. Further, the sharp decline in the value of the\nKyrgyz som over 1997-1999 more than doubled the external public debt burden from 44 percent\nof GDP in 1997 to 91 percent in 1999. Multilateral debt constitutes about 73 percent of the\nexternal public debt. While the bilateral debt is relatively small, its shorter repayment periods\nand higher rates of interest would have made debt servicing fiscally unsustainable between\n2001 and 2006, but for the successful debt renegotiation concluded recently with Russia and\nTurkey, the two largest creditors of the Kyrgyz Republic. As a result, the debt-servicing burden,\nwhich stood at 25.6 percent of fiscal revenues in 2000, is likely to be moderate over the next\nseveral years.\n14. The already high levels of external debt combined with increasing pressures to raise\nmilitary expenditure because of the greater security needs in the south of the country, leave little\nleeway for the Government even to maintain spending on infrastructure investment and social\ntransfers. Almost the entire share of the budget that is not spent on military or external debt\nservicing is now spent on current expenditures, which has led to a deterioration in the quality of\npublicly owned and maintained infrastructure in health, transport, and education. To curtail a\nfurther rise in the debt burden, the PIP, amounting to 9 percent of GDP in 1999 and about 6.8\npercent in 2000, will have to be trimmed. The Government has agreed with the IMF for a\n                                        \n6  The pre-independence level of output has not yet been achieved, with the real gross domestic product in 2000\namounting to only 78 percent of the 1991 real GDP.", "5\nphased  reduction  in  PIP  to  about  3  percent  of  GDP  by  2005.  The  social  impact  of  this\nadjustment is likely to be minimized, however, by avoiding across-the-board cuts and improved\nprioritization of projects.7\n15. To strengthen the banking sector, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) has\n(i)  placed  several  insolvent  banks  under  liquidation  in  stages  over  the  last  five  years,\n(ii) enhanced  the  quality  of  its  on-site  inspection,  and  (iii)  increased  minimum  capital\nrequirements for existing as well as new banks and placed restrictions in the licenses of those\nbanks that cannot meet the increased requirements. However, public confidence in the banking\nsystem is yet to be fully restored. Further, the efficient conduct of monetary policy has been\nhampered by the growing dollarization in the economy, which can be reduced only over time as\nconfidence in the economy and domestic institutions returns. Privatization of large SOEs has\nproceeded only gradually, in part as a result of unrealistic price expectations on the part of the\nGovernment. The Government announced a civil service reform program in January 2001, and\nrestructured a number of ministries and state agencies, including the State Property Fund and\nthe National Securities Commission. Further initiatives are being formulated with WB support.\n16. The  collapse  of  the  regional  export  markets  led  to  the  closure  of  a  number  of\nenterprises, but the decline in industrial output since 1997 was halted in 2000, with the sector\ngrowing  at  6  percent.  This  result,  however,  was  made  possible  only  by  the  initial  growth\nperformance of the Kumtor gold mining project, supported by a large foreign investment. While\nagriculture performed well in 1999-2000, low productivity and poor supporting infrastructure,\nincluding finance, supplies, and marketing, continue to hinder growth in the sector.\n17. GDP growth is expected to remain stable at 5 percent and 5.2 percent in 2001 and 2002,\nrespectively. The ongoing fiscal consolidation will reduce the budget deficit to 5.9 percent of\nGDP in 2001, further to 5 percent by 2002 and to about 3.7 percent by 2005. The cuts in PIP will\nhelp restore some stability in the accumulation and servicing of the external public debt. To\nstimulate  private  domestic  and  foreign  investment,  the  Government's  National  Poverty\nReduction Strategy and the comprehensive development framework (CDF) call for an increase\nin private domestic investment of around 6 percentage points, from 8.6 percent in 1999 to\n14.4 percent of GDP by 2004. Thus far, private investments have failed to take off. Moreover,\nnet FDI fell sharply from $86.6 million to $44 million in 1999, and to $6.9 million in 2000. The\nGovernment aims at increasing FDI to 15 percent of GDP by 2010. These targets are ambitious,\nbut they are critical for future economic growth. Recognizing the acute need, the National\nPoverty Reduction Strategy and the CDF focus on formulating broad-based policy reforms to\ncreate an environment conducive to attracting private investments to fill the void caused by the\ncuts in PIP. Domestic and foreign investors continue to face various constraints, including a\ncomplex  licensing  process,8  difficulties  in  obtaining  finance  as  well  as  protecting  their\ninvestments, general unpredictability in bureaucratic and judicial decisions, concerns over asset\nstripping and renationalization of SOEs, an ineffective legal framework on secured transactions,\nwidespread practices of barter and informal transactions, poor supporting infrastructure, and\nlegal inadequacies and process and procedure-related judicial impediments. The proposed\nProgram  will  focus  on  structural  reforms  in  three  critical  areas  to  improve  the  investment\nclimate. It will specifically (i) strengthen corporate and financial governance reforms, (ii) launch\nlegal and judicial sector reforms, and (iii) facilitate enterprise restructuring.\n                                        \n7  TA 3382-KGZ: Strengthening Capacity of the Ministry of Finance in Financial Management and Planning of the\nPublic Investment Program, for $463,500, approved on 28 December 1999.\n8  It is not uncommon for businesses to get 40 different clearances and licenses. The World Bank's ongoing\nComprehensive Sector Adjustment Credit (approved in 2000) is addressing these constraints.", "6\nIV.  THE SECTOR\nA.  Background and Recent Performance\n18. Despite wide-ranging reforms in many areas, sustainable economic growth and recovery\nhave been elusive in the Kyrgyz Republic. While this is partly a result of locational and structural\nconstraints, a major factor has been the size and scope of activities in the corporate and\nfinancial sectors. There is significant excess capacity in the industry sector and the financial\nsector continues to be small and nascent due to limited lending opportunities. The Program\ncomponents  on  corporate  and  financial  governance  improvements,  and  legal  and  judicial\nreforms will benefit all enterprises (state-owned and private, financial and nonfinancial, as well\nas limited-liability companies and JSCs) in all sectors of the Kyrgyz economy. However, the\nenterprise resolution and restructuring component focuses on SOEs9 in the industry sector and\nprivate enterprises with a significant level of indebtedness to the Government.10\n1.  Legal Structure of Joint-Stock Companies in the Kyrgyz Republic\n19. The primary statutes in the legal framework for enterprises11 include the Civil Code, the\nLaw on Economic Partnerships and Societies (LEPS), the Law on Banks and Banking Activity\n(LBBA), and the Model Company Charter (MCC). All JSCs with more than 50 shareholders, and\ncommercial banks regardless of the number of shareholders, are required to establish a two-tier\nboard structure, comprising a board of directors (BOD) and a board of management (BOM).\nMembers of the BOD are elected at the annual general meeting (AGM) of shareholders of\nJSCs, and upon nomination from the BOD, the members of the BOM are elected by all the\nshareholders. A BOD for a nonfinancial JSC has a minimum of three members and that for a\ncommercial bank has a minimum of five members. A BOM has a minimum of five members.\nThere may be no overlapping membership between the two boards.12 The BOD determines the\nremuneration structure for members of the BOM and performs oversight functions on the latter.\nMembers  of  both  boards  may  be  removed  by  an  AGM  or  any  extraordinary  meeting  of\nshareholders.  In  addition,  each  JSC  is  required  to  have  an  Audit  Commission,  with  no\noverlapping membership on the BOD. Under the law, all JSCs are required to register their\ncharters with the Ministry of Justice, developed in line with the provisions of the MCC, which\nwas adopted in 1997 under CGERP.\n2.  Industry Sector\n20. In  2000,  industrial  enterprises  contributed  22.5  percent  to  GDP;  enterprises  in\nagriculture,  26  percent;  those  in  construction  and  transport  sectors,  9.1  percent;  and  all\nremaining enterprises (including trade and services), 42.4 percent. The enterprises, which were\ninherited from the Soviet era, had been set up in line with the interrepublican division of labor\nthat existed then among the FSU states. The typical structure consisted of giant industrial\n                                        \n9  Those enterprises in which the State holds at least 25 percent of the shares.\n10 Based on comprehensive background work done under TA 3505-KGZ, which focused on 65 large enterprises\n(excluding the four largest utilities, namely JSC Kyrgyz Energo, JSC Kyrygz Telecom, JSC Kyrgyz Airlines, and\nJSC Kyrgyz Gas). Appendix 4 presents data on key indicators on these enterprises.\n11 Enterprises can be organized as general partnerships, limited partnerships, limited-liability companies or JSCs.\nSupplementary Appendix A presents these concepts. Given the liability and shareholding structure of JSCs,\ncorporate governance issues assume much greater importance in JSCs. Supplementary Appendix A also presents\nsome excerpts from the Model Company Charter.\n12 The legal framework allows an exception in the case of very small JSCs, where the management of the company\nmay be vested in one person. Then that person can be a member of the BOD, thereby creating a unitary board.", "7\ncomplexes and enterprise towns located throughout the FSU to serve the markets of the FSU.\nThe location of such enterprises was based on national considerations and had little to do with\nlocal  conditions.  These  enterprises  were  thus  isolated  from  the  local  economy,  since  the\ncentrally planned system determined their input sources and the markets for their products. The\nstructure and location of the industrial complexes placed little significance on economic or\nfinancial viability of the enterprises, but focused on generating employment, in many cases for\nthe workers of closed mines. Further, the financial viability of these enterprises was artificially\npropped up by subsidized energy imports (like gas from Uzbekistan), railway transportation, and\nraw materials. After independence, when links with the FSU were severed, a vast majority of\nsuch enterprises lost their competitiveness virtually overnight.\n21.  The Government initiated a three-phase privatization program in 1991, which is still\nongoing. The Committee on State Property and Foreign Investment (CSPFI)13 was established\nin 1991 to oversee the privatization process and to act as a guardian of state assets. During the\nfirst phase (1991-1993), about 4,700 small SOEs in trade and services were fully privatized\nthrough cash and privatization-voucher auctions to managers and workers. During the second\nphase (1994-1996), about 1,300 medium-sized and large SOEs were first corporatized as JSCs\nand privatized by free distribution of 5 percent of the shares in each JSC to workers and\nmanagement, voucher auctions of up to 25 percent of the shares to the general public, and\ndivestment of the remaining 70 percent through competitive private bidding or direct sale. In\nreality,  however,  these  proportions  differed  according  to  the  strategic  importance  of  the\nenterprise being privatized as well as the preferences of the buyers (primarily managers and\nworkers). The third round of privatization involving the large and strategic SOEs has been under\nway since 1997.\n22. At present, there are around 248 enterprises in which the state holds shares: 149 are\nmajority state-owned, including 14 enterprises fully owned by the state. In total, there are over\n6,500 registered enterprises, of which 2,162 are classified as industrial enterprises. The size\ndistribution of enterprises is skewed, with the top four SOEs (JSC Kyrgyz Energo, JSC Kyrgyz\nTelecom, JSC Kyrgyz Gas, and JSC Kyrgyz Airlines) dominating the industrial landscape and\naccounting for about 70 percent of the capital stock in the economy. Around 40 percent of all\nindustrial enterprises have recorded significant losses over the past consecutive five years, and\nhave also accumulated large financial arrears (Appendix 4). By constraining liquidity, rising\narrears stifle enterprise growth and transactions. To offset this, payments in kind and barter\ntransactions are most prevalent in the Kyrgyz Republic, among the CARs.\n23. Barring the initial rounds of privatization, limited measures have been taken in recent\nyears to reorganize enterprises so as to adapt them to the new prevailing market conditions.14\nThe Government relied mainly on creating the basic legal framework, on the assumption that\nthe  market  can  enforce  efficiency  on  company  operations.  However,  a  large  majority  of\nenterprises generally have continued to operate \u201cas-is,\u201d resulting in ever steeply increasing\n                                        \n13 Until January 2001, it was called the State Property Fund.\n14 The Kyrgyz legal framework allows for five separate types of resolution and bankruptcy proceedings: (i) special\nadministration, resulting in liquidation; (ii) restructuring, in which viable assets are transferred to new entities, with\nthe debts and nonviable assets staying behind with the old enterprise; (iii) sanation, which is a court-sanctioned\nprocedure where a third-party guarantees the payments of all liabilities of a bankrupt enterprise, which can then\nfunction as a going concern; (iv) rehabilitation, which is a consensual agreement among debtors and creditors to\nreorganize the business through the preparation of a comprehensive plan; and (v) amicable settlement, involving\nsettlement of some debts to allow the enterprise to function. Though there are different possibilities, most\nenterprise resolution attempts have resulted in liquidation. For purposes of this Program, the term \u201crestructuring\u201d is\nused in a broad sense, in some places interchangeably with the term \u201cresolution.\u201d", "8\nlosses, rising debts, significant excess capacity, and growing insolvency. While the Government\nhas introduced measures to restrict debt guarantees and budget loans to enterprises, the\nbudget constraints on enterprises continue to be soft, which in turn has impeded efforts to\nstrengthen  enterprises.  Thus  far,  bankruptcy  proceedings  have  been  initiated  against\n422 nonperforming or loss-incurring enterprises, of which 365 have been liquidated. About\n10 percent  have  been  restructured  and  very  few  rehabilitated.  The  financial  health  of  the\nrestructured enterprises is, however, poor, as they are burdened with large outstanding debts to\ncreditors. Proceeds from the liquidation sales have financed less than half the total claims, since\nthere is no major market for the assets. On the other hand, there are expectations that all assets\nwill fetch their book values less depreciation, which considerably delays the disposal of the\nassets. The average time to complete liquidation is high (4-5 years), compared with that in\ndeveloped and emerging economies.\n3. Banking Sector\n24. The  financial  sector  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  small  and  at  a  nascent  stage  of\ndevelopment. There are at present 19 licensed commercial banks including a branch of the\nNational  Bank  of  Pakistan,  in  addition  to  the  Central  Asian  Regional  Development  Bank.\nBanking sector assets account for about 9 percent of GDP, the stock market capitalization is\naround 10 percent of GDP, and the ratio of financial deepening (broad money or M2 to GDP)\nstands at 8.5 percent. The ratio of bank deposits to GDP stood at 5 percent and the ratio of\nbank credits to GDP was 2.3 percent at the end of 2000. Lending margins and intermediation\ncosts have been relatively high. All these reflect the evolving state of the financial sector.\nReforms  since  the  early  1990s  have  strengthened  the  structure  as  well  as  the  regulatory\nframework, facilitating prompt and corrective actions against insolvent banks. In 1996, with\nsupport from WB under the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit, three large state-owned banks\nwere liquidated and Debt Restructuring Agency was established to facilitate recovery of bad\nassets in problem banks. With support from ADB through the FIRM Program,15 NBKR closed\nseven insolvent banks, and increased minimum capital requirements from Som25 million ($0.52\nmillion) in 1999 to Som100 million ($2.1 million) for existing banks and Som300 million ($6.3\nmillion) for new banks. However, the banking system needs further strengthening, given the\noverall weak real sector environment.\n4. Judicial System\n25. The Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic provides for three types of courts in the Kyrgyz\njudicial system (Appendix 5). The Constitutional Court, comprising nine judges, deals with all\nissues and disputes relating to the constitutionality of laws and practices. The Arbitrazh Court\nSystem (ACS) deals with all commercial disputes involving legal entities. It consists of the\nHigher Arbitrazh Court (HAC), which hears appeals from the arbitrazh courts of the capital city\nof Bishkek and the seven oblasts or administrative districts16. The ACS has 60 judges at\npresent, including 18 at the HAC.  Within the arbitrazh courts, cases are heard by one judge at\nthe first instance, and by three judges at the appeals stage within the same court. The HAC\noffers an appellate procedure called \u201csupervision,\u201d although any of the parties concerned can\nmove to the supervision stage at the HAC directly, by-passing the appeals stage. The HAC\nmeets only in Bishkek.\n                                        \n15 Loan 1723-KGZ (SF), footnote 2. See the Board Information Paper (No.R166-01), circulated on 5 October 2001,\nfor further information.\n16 These are Chui, Osh, Jalal-Abad, Yssyk-kul, Naryn, Talas, and Batken.", "9\n26. Disputes of a civil, criminal, or administrative nature relating to physical persons (i.e.,\nindividuals) are dealt with in courts of general jurisdiction, headed by the Supreme Court.\nJurisdiction on disputes between legal entities and physical persons is subject to case-by-case\ndetermination by the court of first instance. Given the larger demand for the adjudication of\nlocal-level civil and criminal disputes, there are more courts and judges of general jurisdiction\nthan there are arbitrazh courts. The Supreme Court has 17 judges and the lower courts have\n244 judges. The Supreme Court and the courts of general jurisdiction are governed by the same\nprocedures of appeal and supervision as within the ACS. Besides these three courts, there is no\nother process (such as third-party arbitration) for resolving disputes in the Kyrgyz Republic. The\nConstitution also recognizes military courts.\n27. Judges in high courts (Constitutional Court, HAC, and Supreme Court) must be between\n35 and 70 years of age, qualified as practicing lawyers for not less than 10 years. The judges of\nthe Constitutional Court are nominated by the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, and elected for\n15 years by both houses of Parliament. Judges of the Supreme Court and HAC are nominated\nby the President, and elected for 10 years by the lower (legislative) house of Parliament. Judges\nof local courts should be under 65, and have at least 5 years of legal practice. They are\nappointed directly by the President initially for a term of three years. Upon recommendation by\nan Attestation Commission, their terms are extended for another seven years.17 Under the\nKyrgyz Constitution, judges enjoy full immunity for acts performed in their judicial capacity.\nB.  Constraints and Issues\n1.  Weak  Operational,  Monitoring,  and  Legal  Environment  for  Corporate\nGovernance\n28. With implementation of CGERP, there is greater awareness of corporate governance\nstandards and procedures, as outlined in the Handbook on Corporate Governance and the\nMCC.18 As of mid-2000, 95 percent of the 1,400 JSCs had registered their company charters\nwith the Ministry of Justice. The CDC had provided training and advisory services in corporate\nmanagement  and  governance  to  around  1,500  managers  and  employees  of  various\nenterprises.19 However, while basic institutional capacity for corporate governance has been\nestablished, the environment for good corporate governance continues to be weak, particularly\nin large SOEs and JSCs in the private sector. While the formulation and adoption of a company\ncharter has been mandatory, there are operational, regulatory, and monitoring, as well legal\nweaknesses. In many cases, the key shareholders of JSCs are not aware of, or neglect, their\nresponsibilities  and  accountability,  and  abuse  their  rights.  The  concept  of  limited  personal\nliability is often interpreted in a liberal manner and used by key shareholders to the detriment of\nenterprises. Corporate governance is particularly weak in SOEs. Members of the BOD of SOEs\nare generally appointed by their supervising ministries and include mainly Government officials\nand local administration officials. In most SOEs, independent directors have no representation\non the BOD, as there is no specific legal requirement for the same. In such cases, directors\nintervene in day-to-day managerial decisions, compromising the autonomy of management. In\nmany  SOEs,  the  contracts  between  the  BOD  and  the  BOM  are  poorly  defined,  thereby\n                                        \n17 Appendix 5 presents the scheme relating to jurisdictions and appeals in the Kyrgyz court system. Tables 1 to 7 in\nSupplementary Appendix B present data on the number of cases that pass through the ACS, number of judges,\nand their salaries.\n18 Both adopted under CGERP in 1997, through Government Resolution No. 433. The handbook outlines the general\ncorporate governance principles and practices around the world. It is a promotional document, while the MCC is a\nlegal statute.\n19 Supported under TA Loan 1547-KGZ (footnote 1).", "10\npreventing the emergence of a good performance-based incentive system. In general, failure to\nfollow sound criteria for appointment to the BOD and the BOM, and the practice of overlapping\nappointments between the two boards in some enterprises lead to operational problems and\ninternal conflicts of interest.\n29. Overall,  the  monitoring  process  and  regulation  of  legal  provisions  on  corporate\ngovernance of SOEs have been weak. The State Committee on Securities Market (SCSM),\nwhich is entrusted with monitoring JSCs for compliance with legal provisions on governance,\ncomes into frequent conflicts on regulatory issues with the CSPFI, which acts as a guardian of\nstate shares. Further, SCSM also lacks regulatory capacity. It compiles a large amount of\ninformation on JSCs, but does not engage in effective compliance monitoring. In addition to\nweak internal governance, as evident in the case of JSC Kyrgyz Gas Munaizat for example,\nwhich became bankrupt due to lack of adequate internal controls, SOEs also suffer from the\nabsence  of  a  clear  and  coherent  corporate  policy  framework.  Even  strategically  important\nenterprises do not have clear objectives or forward-looking development plans that could guide\ntheir production or prudent financial planning. A weak operational and financial environment,\nwhich  is  worsened  by  the  overall  weak  economic  conditions,  in  combination  with  lack  of\nadherence  to  good  governance  principles  in  appointment  to  the  BOD  and  BOM,  leads  to\nmisreporting and improper transactions, including asset stripping.\n30. There are various inadequacies in the legal framework, both within the LEPS as well as\nin  terms  of  inconsistencies  between  the  Civil  Code  and  the  LEPS.  These  include  (i) the\nprovision that shareholders can redeem their shares if they disagree with the decisions of an\nAGM; (ii) provision that shareholders have to approve all transactions, including minor ones,\nthat the BOD and BOM can engage in on behalf of a JSC; (iii) undue powers given to majority\nshareholders to suspend the decisions of the BOD and the BOM, without convening a general\nmeeting  of  all  shareholders;  (iv)  excessive  liability  placed  on  the  BOM  for  any  negative\noutcomes from business judgments, which results in a misalignment of incentives given to the\nBOD and the BOM; (v) inadequate representation of independent directors in the BOD; (vi)\ninadequate provisions on the valuation of shares; (vii) unclear provisions on conversion of\npreferred (i.e., nonvoting) to ordinary shares; (viii) lack of clear definition of affiliated parties; (ix)\nunsatisfactory treatment of capital, including lack of flexibility to increase share capital to cover\nlosses; (x) nonpermissibility of debt-to-equity swaps; (xi) stipulation that 25 percent of profits be\npaid as dividends rather than giving flexibility to the AGM to determine dividends and retained\nearnings, which may constrain a JSC\u2019s ability to meet its critical investment needs; and (xii) lack\nof protection given to third parties that enter into transactions with JSCs.\n2. Lack of Reliable and Transparent Information on Enterprises\n31. The reporting requirements imposed by the CSFPI and by the SCSM on SOEs and\nJSCs, respectively, appear to be cumbersome and outdated. These agencies collect a lot of\ninformation, but most of it is eventually not utilized. Financial information on critical indicators\n(e.g., periodic valuation of capital stock, utilization and/or reinvestment of profits, etc.) and data\non compliance with labor and environmental standards by SOEs and JSCs are not available.\nLack of financial information is due partly to lack of national standards on financial valuation of\nphysical  assets,  which  affects  commercial  and  financial  transactions.  Enterprise  liquidation\nproceedings are delayed due to lack of reliable estimates on the value of assets.\n32. The implementation of accounting reforms in the Kyrgyz Republic started in 1998 when\nthe  Government  established  an  Interagency  Commission  on  Accounting,  with  authority  to\nregulate accounting and determine the uniform state policy in accounting issues. The Kyrgyz", "11\nAccounting  Standards,  formulated  in  1997,  consisted  of  18  standards  generally  based  on\ninternational accounting standards (IAS). However, in some major respects, the standards\nadopted  materially  differed  from  the  IAS,  leaving  the  Kyrgyz  Accounting  Standards  non-\ncompliant with the IAS. Also, a majority of the strategic JSCs and many state organizations,\nincluding the State Tax Inspectorate, are still using the Soviet accounting standards. Through an\nAccounting Reform Project financed by the United States Agency for International Development\n(USAID) over three years in 1998-2000, Kyrgyz Accounting Standards were introduced in 1,060\nsmall and medium-size enterprises, and 4,500 private sector commercial accountants were\ntrained. The Government recently established the State Commission for Standards of Financial\nReporting and Auditing (SCSFRA) to enhance the quality of accounting and financial reporting.\nSCSFRA has the authority to develop and prescribe accounting and auditing standards and\nnorms for all registered enterprises and businesses, which fully correspond to the international\nstandards of financial accounting being developed by the IAS Committee (London). SCSFRA is\nin need of significant support in policy, regulatory, and capacity-building areas to carry out these\ntasks. While the Government has stipulated that financial accounting of all legal entities must\nconform to IAS beginning from 2001 through resolutions and decrees, progress thus far has\nbeen slow due to lack of institutional capacity in accounting in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n3. Poor Corporate Governance in the Banking Sector\n33. The regulatory framework for banks has been strengthened over the last five years.\nHowever,  interference  by  shareholders  in  the  day-to-day  functioning  of  commercial  banks'\nmanagement and in lending decisions, and insider abuses result in imprudent lending practices.\nThere have been instances of deliberate frauds committed by shareholders with the connivance\nof managers (e.g., Maksat Bank), and cases of shareholders advising managers to defy NBKR\nregulations. The financial positions of Kramds Bank and Insan Bank deteriorated significantly as\na result of shareholder interference and interconnected lending. While these problem banks\nhave been placed under liquidation, the imprudent practices have emerged because current\nlegislation (particularly the LBBA) impedes NBKR's ability to effectively exercise its oversight\nfunctions. The weaknesses relate to (i) weak licensing provisions that do not properly define a\nbank and its capital and contain inadequate remedies for unauthorized banking, (ii) inadequate\ncriteria for enforcement actions, (iii) unclear provisions for dealing with anticompetitive activities\nin the banking sector, (iv) lack of sound provisions on corporate governance, and (v) problems\nin the insolvency framework for commercial banks.\n34. Further, the LBBA gives no specific criteria on fitness and propriety for shareholders and\ndirectors. While NBKR can establish requirements in its regulation, the law does not require\nmembers of the BOD to have any professional qualifications. For instance, a court conviction\ndoes not disqualify a person from continuing on the BOD. The major defect in the LBBA,\nhowever, is in respect of principal shareholders (those holding at least 5 percent of the shares)\nwho are required to present evidence only of their financial status, but their fitness or propriety\nin other respects is generally not examined or challenged. For instance, a shareholder may be\nunfit (e.g., with criminal convictions for fraud or involvement in failed banks or other banks\nwhose  licenses  have  been  revoked  for  serious  breaches  of  legislation)  and  yet  may  be\npermitted to be a shareholder if his financial stability can be proved. Members of the BOM and\nother senior executives must be professionally qualified, but the requirements are not applied on\na  continuous  and  ongoing  basis.  These  problems  are  further  compounded,  as  many\nshareholders of commercial banks are influential through position or power, which impedes\ncorrective regulatory actions by NBKR. Further, whatever minimal sanctions and powers NBKR\nhas are too often ignored because of practices within the judiciary. While the inadequacies in\nthe LBBA may be ameliorated through appropriate NBKR regulations, courts often resort to", "12\nlegislation rather than allow themselves to be governed by the regulations. In summary, the\nlegal framework lacks requirements for (i) the presence of independent members on the BOD;\n(ii) qualifications of principal shareholders and members of the BOD, or on the disclosure of the\nfinancial interests of members of the BOD and the BOM, on an ongoing basis; (iii) establishment\nof obligatory committees of the BOD for risk management and director nominations; (iv) explicit\nfiduciary responsibilities for members of the BOD or the BOM, thus jeopardizing the depositors'\ninterests; (v) rules on avoiding conflicts of interest by the BOD and the BOM; and (vi) the\napparent preferential treatment given to transactions with related parties vis-\u00e0-vis unrelated\nparties.\n35. The  general  Law  on  Bankruptcy  deals  with  bankruptcies  of  banks  as  well.  Recent\nexperience has shown that judges are generally inexperienced in bank regulatory matters. More\nimportantly, courts are reluctant to declare technically insolvent banks as bankrupt, as they use\nthe balance sheet-over-liabilities20 test, which poses major problems in the absence of good\nvaluation practices. While NBKR presents its valuation of a bank's assets, in addition to the\nbank's own book values and doubtful assertions of other assets, the Law on Bankruptcy does\nnot set out adequate grounds for treatment of insolvency of financial institutions; as a result,\nliquidation of insolvent banks is delayed. This significantly undermines the credibility of banking\nsupervision,  and  aggravates  the  problem  if  insolvency  has  been  due  to  the  principal\nshareholders\u2019  violation  of  governance  norms.  At  the  same  time,  a  viable  bank  cannot  be\nrehabilitated,  since  the  Law  on  Bankruptcy  does  not  provide  for  special  administrators  to\neliminate  insolvency  by  lowering  the  claims  of  creditors.  Moreover,  the  powers  of  special\nadministrators are limited, as the rights of the shareholders are not fully extinguished under the\nlaw on bankruptcy even after insolvency is established. The problems are compounded by the\nprevalent court practice of replacing qualified liquidators appointed by NBKR.\n4. Deficiencies in the Legal Framework on Protection of Creditors' Rights\n36. Significant problems exist in the legal and implementation framework on pledges, which\nimpose  unnecessary  transaction  costs  and  risks  and  act  as  deterrents  to  potential\ninvestments.21 First, conflicts between the Civil Code and the Law on Pledges have prevented\ncreditors  from  effectively  enforcing  pledges,  or  from  doing  so  without  court  and  notary\nparticipation,  which  is  time-consuming,  uncertain,  and  costly.  Second,  while  the  Law  on\nMortgage seems to focus on land transactions, its provisions are not clearly defined and the\nrelationship between this law and the Law on Pledges is unclear, particularly with regard to\n(i) the rights of ownership (and pledge rights) of companies where foreigners have more than\n20 percent of the equity, or (ii) whether the Law on Mortgage applies to a pledge of a whole\nenterprise under the Law on Pledges. Creditors face difficulties in creating and registering\ndifferent types of pledges. Moreover, the court system is perceived to be inefficient and corrupt,\nlending credence to the argument that courts should be excluded from involvement in enforcing\npledges on immovable property. This, however, is not possible at present.  The process of\npledge enforcement on immovable properties under the Law of Mortgage is time-consuming.\nTaking control of collateral that is in the possession of a third party is difficult, and it is not clear\nwhich court supervises the execution of a judgment\u2014the court where the jurisdiction of the\nproperty lies or the court that issues the execution writ. These problems are compounded\nfurther by significant court costs, fees to notaries and court executors, rigidities in execution and\n                                        \n20 In general, this focuses on the balance of physical and financial assets, rather than a proper assessment of the\nactual debts and liabilities, on a net basis. For banks, this refers to reliance on book values of assets (loans), rather\nthan assessment of recovery potential.\n21 The existence of a major commercial bank recently was threatened by significant losses on pledges.", "13\ncourt procedures, problems with valuations of pledged property on sale, delays caused by\nabsent pledgers, and claims by taxation authorities that the funds obtained by banks from the\nsale of a pledged property amount to a taxable profit.\n5.  Weaknesses in the Judiciary and Law Enforcement\n37. A  recent  survey  on  corporate  governance  sponsored  by  the  European  Bank  for\nReconstruction and Development (EBRD) reported that investors perceive the legal framework\nand the law enforcement system to provide only limited protection of their interests in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic,  as  opposed  to  Russia  (moderate  protection)  and  Kazakhstan  (reasonably\ncomprehensive protection). Despite the introduction of recent legislation on JSCs and limited-\nliability companies, bankruptcy, and pledge procedures, the resolution of commercial disputes is\nbased on inefficient procedures and often involves unpredictable outcomes for creditors. More\nimportantly,  significant  problems  exist  within  the  judiciary  itself.  Many  recent  studies  and\nsurveys, including those carried out by Transparency International, United Nations Development\nProgramme, and ADB, have pointed out that the general public, and both local and foreign\ninvestors perceive as poor the way the judiciary functions in the Kyrgyz Republic, particularly for\ncommercial dispute resolution. The main issues are (i) weaknesses and inefficiencies in the\njudicial decision-making process, and (ii) possible corruption and lack of independence of the\njudiciary.\n38. The Kyrgyz judicial system is somewhat unique in that there are separate stages for\n\"appeals\" and \"supervision of appeals.\"22  In many instances, the appeals and supervision\nstages decide issues of fact by considering new evidence, which should in the first instance be\nconsidered by the lower courts. Recently, the Constitutional Court ruled that the HAC or the\nSupreme Court cannot deliver a judgment that is different from that of the original court and\nmust therefore refer the case back to the lower court for a rehearing. This process of a case\nmoving back and forth between the appeals and supervision stages leads to significant delays\nin the settlement of disputes and lack of finality. For example, the Debt Restructuring Agency\nwent through 37 appeals in one of its cases, resulting in significant time and monetary costs.\nUntil  recently,  the  supervision  stage  consisted  of  only  3 HAC  or  Supreme  Court  judges.\nHowever, as a result of a recent ruling by the Constitutional Court, all cases that come for\nsupervision now have to be heard by nine or more judges. This has led to significant delays in\nresolving commercial and other disputes.\n39. In  addition  to  civil  and  criminal  cases,  the  Supreme  Court  may  also  handle  many\ndisputes that are of a commercial nature, involving physical persons or individuals. This role\nplayed by the Supreme Court and its lower level courts, however, leads to frequent conflicts of\njurisdiction. For example, if NBKR challenges a bank in the ACS and seeks to revoke its license,\na shareholder who is a physical person may challenge this decision in the Supreme Court,\ncausing a deadlock. Such conflicts cause problems in enforcing legal rights in many situations,\nand not only in relation to NBKR and banks.\n40. The  Kyrgyz  Constitution  states  that  justice  cannot  be  determined  outside  the  court\nsystem. The Constitutional Court has interpreted the Constitution to exclude specialized courts\nor  bodies,  including  an  arbitration  tribunal  that  was  functioning  earlier  under  the  Kyrgyz\n                                        \n22 In general, an appeal is made on the decision reached at the first instance, and the appeals stage will consider\nwhether the first instance court wrongly applied the law to the facts or followed wrong procedures.  In the Kyrgyz\nRepublic, the second level of appeal is referred to as supervision, and the court at this stage is bound to consider\nthe whole case again in its fullest detail.", "14\nChamber  of  Commerce.  Hence,  extrajudicial  or  third-party  resolution  of  disputes  is  not\npermissible at present in the Kyrgyz legal system. As a result all commercial disputes have to\ngo through the ACS, which has been significantly overburdened in light of the rulings on\nappellate procedures and court bench composition. This lack of recognition of arbitration outside\nthe national court system extends to foreign arbitral awards as well. While the Kyrgyz Republic\nis a signatory to the New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral\nAwards, Kyrgyz courts have not adhered to its provisions in several cases, and awards made\nelsewhere are not enforceable in the Kyrgyz Republic. There have also been instances where\nlegislation  was  deliberately  misinterpreted  to  discriminate  against  foreign  creditors  and\ninvestors.\n41. While the preceding constraints pertain to the resolution of commercial and investment-\nrelated disputes, various other shortcomings of a systemic nature apply to the judicial system as\na  whole,  including  the  ACS.  The  nominations  of  judges  are  made  by  the  President  and\napproved by one or both houses of the Parliament for the higher levels (Constitutional Court,\nHAC, and Supreme Court positions), and the appointments at the lower levels (ACS and lower\ncourts  of  general  jurisdiction)  are  made  by  the  President,  upon  initial  selection  by  the\nPresident\u2019s  Administration.  This,  in  addition  to  the  limited  tenure  of  the  judges  and  the\nattestation  process  that  certifies  judges  based  on  opaque  procedures,  makes  the  judges\nbeholden to the executive branch of the Government. It is also common practice for lawyers\nwho have previously worked in Government offices in positions of influence to get appointed as\njudges. Such practice casts doubt on the independence of the judiciary, as not all judges are\nappointed purely on the basis of merit. While there are broad requirements on age, educational\nbackground  and  experience,  there  is  no  consistent  system  of  training  for  judgeships,  as\npracticed in many developed countries. All these factors have given rise to concerns that judges\nmay not be sufficiently qualified to be judges, and that they may be biased in their judgments,\nbesides being officially and materially influenced. Judges, particularly at the lower levels, can\nalso be dismissed or demoted fairly easily. While the population at large needs to be protected\nfrom incompetent or corrupt judges in order to ensure that the judiciary is held in the highest\nesteem, judges need to be protected in their positions as well.\n42. While judicial salaries have been increased to around Som15,000 ($314) per month for\njudges at the highest level, the salaries, status, and working conditions in the judiciary are\nconsidered to be inadequate. At present, salaries in the judiciary are on average only 20 percent\nof what private sector lawyers earn.23 Low salaries and lack of job security may provide avenues\nfor  corruption,  which  in  turn  may  make  any  salary  or  administrative  reforms  meaningless.\nHence, it is critical that the pecuniary and nonpecuniary rewards be reviewed to encourage well-\nqualified and experienced candidates to become judges and to reduce the scope for material or\nother influence in the judicial processes and procedures. A related issue is also how the existing\nsystem of determining court fees and allocating budgetary resources for the court system can\nbe strengthened to provide proper incentives to the judiciary.\n43. Not all judicial decisions are published. Judges do not separate factual from legal issues\nin their judgments and generally they do not present any reasons or explain how they reached\ntheir decisions, which make the decision-making process appear opaque. Given the lack of\npublished  judgments  and  the  gaps  in  the  decisions,  other  judges  cannot  easily  verify\n                                        \n23 Uzbekistan is the leader among the CARs, with the ratio of public versus private sector salaries at 50 percent,\nfollowed by Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan, in that order. The ratio in Russia is around 15\npercent. See EBRD, 2000. Transition Report, p.26-27.", "15\nprecedence or fully understand prior verdicts. In several instances, similar cases have not been\ntreated alike. Moreover, public access to hearings is restricted, even in simple cases.\n44. Since the rights, powers, and functions of executors of judicial awards are not clearly\ndefined  in  existing  legislation,  enforcement  of  judgments  often  encounters  difficulties.\nJudgments  are  ignored  in  some  cases,  and  owners  or  managers  may  prevent  executors,\nincluding  liquidators  in  bankruptcy  cases,  from  taking  possession  of  property.  As  a\nconsequence,  legal  norms  continue  to  be  violated  even  after  executors  or  liquidators  are\nappointed. An added problem for the plaintiffs is that the executors' fees are high, as they are\nfixed percentages of the assets recovered. Moreover, Kyrgyz legislation does not have any\nspecific rules to deal with contempt or disobedience of court orders and rulings, and the fines\nimposed are generally miniscule in relation to the claims involved.\n6.  Weak  Operational  and  Financial  Performance  of  Industry  Sector\nEnterprises\n45. The operational and financial performance of enterprises24 in the industry sector has\nbeen poor and a growing number of firms are on the verge of technical insolvency. As of 1999,\nout of the 2,162 industrial enterprises for which information is available, and around 40 percent\nof the enterprises have been incurring losses over the last five years. Total losses amounted to\n8 percent of GDP in 1999 (Som3.8 billion), relative to around 14 percent of GDP in1998\n(Som4.7 billion).25 The losses are a result of a combination of factors, including high production\ncost due to low capacity utilization. In 1999, average capacity utilization in the sector was about\n36 percent. Only a few enterprises operate throughout the year.26 This problem has been\naggravated in many enterprises where the Government extended credits to purchase new\nequipment without regard to the marketability of the manufactured products or adequacy of\nfinance for raw materials. As a result, existing equipments are underutilized in most enterprises.\nEnterprise management has generally been reluctant to downsize operations by selling idle\nassets. In many situations, downsizing of production facilities will require decommissioning of\nobsolete plant and equipment and restructuring production. Inventories of finished goods and\nmaterials have also stockpiled. At the end of 1999, the inventory of finished goods stood at\nSom7.5 billion ($158 million) or about 15 percent of GDP.\n46. Many enterprises are highly leveraged. The Government through loans from the budget\nand guarantees had extended a total assistance of Som17.2 billion ($364 million) at the end of\n2000. Over 91 percent of budget loans and 21 percent of direct foreign credits, amounting to\nabout $84 million, guaranteed by the government remain overdue. Bankrupt enterprises owe\nabout a third of the outstanding debt. These figures do not capture the actual default position, as\nthe Government has resorted to rescheduling loans at highly soft terms and without seeking any\nmajor reorganization of enterprise operations in numerous cases. In many instances, loans\nwere extended to enterprises already insolvent and had little opportunity to repay. A large\nnumber of enterprises have also accumulated significant social security and tax arrears.\n                                        \n24 Enterprises here refer to SOEs as well as privately owned enterprises. As noted earlier, all SOEs are organized as\nJSCs following their corporatization.\n25  These  figures  measure  against  the  following  indicators  for  the  industry  sector:  realized  output  valued  at\nSom28.9 billion ($605 million), total assets valued at Som30 billion ($29 million); and capital at Som19 billion ($398\nmillion).\n26 A survey of 151 large and medium-size enterprises, carried out by the Polish Socio-Economic Research Center,\nindicates that only 13 percent of the companies operated throughout the year and only 12 percent are utilizing\nmore than 50 percent of capacity.", "16\n 47. In 1999, the total accounts payable in the industry sector stood at Som6.4 billion ($134\nmillion or about 13 percent of GDP), against overdue receivables of Som5.2 billion ($109 million\nor 10.7 percent of GDP).27 Over 40 percent of the payables are overdue, i.e., over one year, and\nabout 30 percent of the receivables, of which a major part is outside of the Kyrgyz Republic, is\nnot collectible. The high level of receivables with delays in obtaining cash has put pressure on\nthe working capital requirements of enterprises. The largest creditor and debtor arrears are in\nenergy-related enterprises, despite the fact that energy inputs continue to be heavily subsidized.\nOne significant result of accumulated debts to creditors is the transfer of financial distress to\nlocal suppliers of materials, energy, transport services, and the financial sector.\n48. Private enterprises have little access to bank finance for a variety of reasons. Trade\nfinance is provided only on a very limited basis, as few exporting firms have access to letters of\ncredit, money orders, bills of exchange, and other modern payment instruments for commercial\ntransactions. In addition, settlement accounts in commercial banks are taxed. Since the first\nquarter of 1999, the stock of total loans to the private sector has shrunk by almost 25 percent,\nand has then stabilized at Som1.5 billion. Less than 10 percent of all industrial enterprises resort\nto loans from banks, and the share of bank loans in total loans is in the order of 5 percent.\n49. Three broad sets of constraints have led to the dismal performance of the industry\nsector, including (i) lack of internal controls and management weaknesses that stem from the\nprivatization process, in which large segments of enterprises were sold at steep discounts to\nexisting  management  and  workers;  (ii)  lack  of  environment  conducive  to  private  sector\ndevelopment, and the distorted industrial structure inherited from the FSU; and (iii) lack of\naccess to foreign markets and protectionist trade practices adopted by neighboring countries\nand trading partners.\n50. While  the  enterprise-level  problems  and  constraints  are  significant,  a  coordinated\napproach to reorganization28 of facilities, coupled with an asset disposal plan and phaseout of\nnonviable  enterprises,  is  yet  to  be  developed.  Persistent  losses,  inability  to  reorganize\nproduction  facilities  and  products,  lack  of  knowledge  of  markets  and  marketing,  poor\nmanagement, and lack of appropriate cost and financial records are common factors hindering\nthe establishment of modern business practices. Management and government officials still\nfocus on maintaining or increasing production levels, without reviewing the financial implications\nand  commercial  viability  of  operations.  Imprudent  operational  and  financial  management\npractices  have  resulted  in  significant  deterioration  of  the  quality  of  assets  and  loss  of\nattractiveness to investors. These sector-level weaknesses in policy, operational, and financial\nareas  have  also  been  confirmed  in  an  in-depth  sample  survey  and  analysis  of  65  large\nenterprises undertaken by ADB.29\n                                        \n27 Overall enterprise sector (covering industrial and nonindustrial enterprises) creditor and debtor arrears were also\nhigh at 39 percent and 28.7 percent of GDP, respectively, in 1999.\n28 In the Kyrgyz legal context, reorganization is understood to include operational and financial restructuring as well\nas partial liquidation.\n29 Supported by ADB TA 3505-KGZ: Preparation of the Second Phase of the Corporate Governance and Enterprise\nReform Program (footnote 3). The enterprises are in building materials, wood, chemicals and glass, machine\nbuilding, electronic, light industry, and food processing subsectors, and account for about 20 percent of industry\nsector employment. Their average capacity utilization is around 32 percent, and 32 percent of their transactions are\non barter terms. Their accumulated accounts payable stand at Som2.7 billion ($56.6 million), which is about\n50 percent of the sector-wide arrears; receivables amount to Som588 million ($12.3 million). Appendix 4 presents\nthe operational and financial data on these enterprises.", "17\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n51. Reforms in the enterprise and financial sectors have been supported by ADB, IMF, WB,\nand USAID. Under the Private Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit of $60 million, approved in\n1994, WB focused on privatization of SOEs, and supported restructuring and liquidation of\n25 large loss-incurring SOEs, through a special care and maintenance program executed by a\nspecial resolution agency. Under the program, 21 enterprises were restructured in varying\ndegrees  and  4 enterprises  were  liquidated.  WB  subsequently  approved  the  Agriculture\nPrivatization and Enterprise Adjustment Credit of $45 million in 1995, which supported de-\nmonopolization and privatization of SOEs in agriculture and eliminated commodity price and\ntrade controls. No major multilateral support for enterprise restructuring has been provided after\nthese  two  programs.  EBRD  has  acted  as  a  catalyst  for  introducing  good  governance  in\nenterprises  that  receive  EBRD  credit  or  equity  investments.  USAID  has  supported  capital\nmarket  development,  training  of  accountants  to  implement  IAS,  and  training  and  capacity\nbuilding of lawyers under its commercial law project. The Government has requested ADB to\nplay a central role in the area of corporate governance. Support from other aid agencies in the\nabovementioned areas will complement ADB\u2019s efforts in corporate governance.\n52. WB\u2019s Financial Sector Adjustment Credit, approved in 1996, focused on strengthening\nprudential regulation of banks, privatization and commercialization of former state-owned banks,\nand  liquidation  of  nonviable  banks.  In  October  2000,  WB  approved  the  Comprehensive\nStructural Adjustment Credit of $45 million, to streamline licensing processes for new start-ups\nand to strengthen reforms in key public utilities (specifically in JSC Kyrgyz Energo). As a follow-\nup to this, preparatory work by WB is under way to formulate a Governance Reform Adjustment\nCredit to focus on public expenditure management reforms and, to a limited extent, civil service\nreforms.\nD. ADB's Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n1.  Country Strategy\n53. ADB's operational strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic envisages support for a smooth\ntransition  to  a  market-oriented  economy  while  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability.  The\nstrategy focuses on several key areas (i) improvements in the provision of public services;\n(ii) agriculture, including rural finance; (iii) human resources development; and (iv) infrastructure,\nparticularly investments to preserve the economic utility of past investments in the energy and\nroad sectors. To address the financial sector weaknesses aggravated by the Russian financial\ncrisis of 1998, ADB in 1999 expanded the scope of the strategy to support selected financial\nsector reforms within the overall framework of facilitating the economic transition.\n54. While the strategy continues to support the transition to market-orientation, poverty\nreduction has taken the central role in ADB's country strategy. The Government is at present\nformulating the National Poverty Reduction Strategy, with significant support from ADB. The\nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy and the CDF set the broad strategic directions for adoption\nby the Kyrgyz Republic over the next decade. While reforms have focused on macroeconomic\ngrowth to be broad-based, their impact on poverty and inequality has not been satisfactory. The\nKyrgyz Republic remains one of the poorest countries among the FSU countries, with a GDP\nper  capita  of  $255  as  of  1999.  Poverty  incidence  rose  sharply  from  51.9  percent  of  the\npopulation in 1996 to 64.1 percent in 1999. Against this background, poverty reduction will\nremain on top of any reform agenda that the Government pursues.", "18\n2. Sector Strategy\n55. The Kyrgyz Republic has made significant strides in liberalizing external trade. The\nbenefits  from  trade  liberalization  will  increase  if  its  trading  partners  also  undertake\ncommensurate reforms. The immediate challenges lie, however, in effectively managing the real\nand financial sectors, as domestic policy reforms in these sectors have lagged behind trade and\nexternal sector reforms. Specifically, the tasks relate to (i) speedy resolution of enterprise\nproblems and providing a conducive policy and institutional environment in which enterprises\ncan function well; (ii) enhancing public confidence in the banking system through effective\nresolution  of  problem  banks,  particularly  those  with  internal  governance  weaknesses;  and\n(iii) restoring public and investor confidence in the judiciary.\n56. Under  CGERP,30  the  Government,  with  ADB's  support,  adopted  a  comprehensive\napproach  to  facilitate  the  transition  of  Kyrgyz  enterprises  to  a  market-oriented  economy.\nCGERP also supported significant capacity-building activities through a TA loan31 that provided\nsupport for (i) enhancing the awareness and capacity of government officials in the area of\ncorporate  governance;  (ii)  training  enterprise  managers  and  officials;  (iii)  a  comprehensive\npublic information dissemination program on the benefits of a sound corporate governance\nstructure; and (iv) training judges, court personnel, government officials, and liquidators dealing\nwith bankruptcy cases. The TA loan also included a component to finance the renovation of\nselected buildings for use by the ACS. While the program loan component of CGERP has been\nconcluded, the TA loan is currently under implementation.\n57. The  FIRM  Program32  aimed  at  strengthening  financial  intermediation  through\n(i) measures for prompt and corrective action on weak banks, (ii) enhancing prudential norms\nand  tightening  on-site  supervision  procedures,  (iii)  improving  the  reliability  of  vulnerability\nassessments through financial and operational audits of commercial banks, and (iv) enhancing\ntransparency and disclosure of all financial information pertaining to the banking sector as well\nas public debt management. The second tranche of the FIRM Program, ($16.1 million) originally\nscheduled for release in March 2001 was released in October 2001 after one of the core second\ntranche  release  conditions  relating  to  the  resolution  of  Kairat  Bank  was  complied  with  in\nSeptember 2001. While the FIRM Program has supported increased efficiency of commercial\nbanks, a full-fledged reform program is needed to enhance the viability of the enterprise sector,\nsince there are significant credit quality concerns on the part of commercial banks. Past ADB\nprograms, however, have not provided any direct operational support for restructuring in the real\nsector. With regard to the judiciary, while some training was provided to implement bankruptcy\nprocedures  under  CGERP,  no  significant  support  was  provided  for  comprehensive  judicial\nreforms.\nV. THE PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n58. The  macroeconomic  recovery  achieved  in  1996-1997  was  primarily  a  product  of\naccelerated growth in agriculture, as productivity in industry had been on the decline since the\nearly 1990s. The initial phase of enterprise privatization was implemented during 1991-1996,\nthrough the issuance of privatization vouchers and sale of shares in smaller and medium-sized\n                                        \n30  Loan 1546-KGZ (SF): Corporate Governance and Enterprise Reform Program, (footnote 1).\n31  Loan 1547-KGZ (SF): Capacity Building for Corporate Governance, (footnote 1).\n32 Loan 1723-KGZ (SF): Financial Intermediation and Resource Mobilization Program, (footnote 2).", "19\nenterprises (para. 21). This led to widely dispersed and small shareholdings, making it difficult\nfor  shareholders  to  monitor  the  performance  of  enterprises.  In  addition,  the  privatization\nprogram awarded minority, but large blocks of shares (in the range of 30-35 percent) to the\nexisting management and workers, which led to insider control by management and workers,\nwho lacked the modern management skills necessary to operate these enterprises in a market\nenvironment.  Recognizing  the  need  to  enhance  enterprise  efficiency  so  as  to  sustain\nmacroeconomic  recovery,  the  Government  sought  support  through  CGERP  to  address\nproblems resulting from the enterprise privatization process, which hindered good corporate\ngovernance. CGERP (i) introduced guidelines on corporate governance standards\u2014stipulated\nthrough the MCC and a Government resolution\u2014and established institutional capacity in the\nform of the CDC; (ii) aimed to eliminate budgetary support to enterprises; and (iii) strengthened\nthe legal framework and institutional capacity for bankruptcy procedures.\n59. While CGERP and FIRM (paras. 3 and 4) supported the first round of corporate and\nfinancial sector reforms, the process of transforming enterprises and financial institutions is far\nfrom  complete.  The  transition  to  full  market  orientation  has  been  impeded  by  continuing\nstructural constraints as well as weak governance at various levels, particularly in large JSCs,\nSOEs, and banks, as outlined in Chapter IV. Though basic awareness of corporate governance\nhas increased, implementing CGERP has demonstrated a number of lessons that need to be\nconsidered for any governance reforms to be meaningful. A sound legal framework needs to be\nformulated to facilitate the adoption of modern corporate and financial governance standards.\nWhile CGERP has provided the basic foundation through the MCC, the guiding legislation for\nJSCs and commercial banks needs to be significantly strengthened. Given that judges rely\nheavily on legal provisions and procedures without due regard for commercial expediency, the\ninconsistencies across different laws must be removed. Adoption of modern accounting and\nauditing standards has to be backed by a proper legal framework, to ensure that enterprises will\nconvert from old to internationally accepted standards.\n60. The  most  important  lessons  from  CGERP  pertain  to  the  need  to  strengthen  the\nenforcement of good governance standards, promote a sound and well-functioning judiciary,\nprovide  alternative  means  for  resolving  commercial  disputes,  and  formulate  measures  to\naddress the weak financial and operational performance of enterprises. CGERP has shown that\ninadequate legal provisions and weak enforcement can lead to erosion in public and investor\nconfidence. Hence, it is critical to strengthen the enforcement and regulatory framework with\nrespect to corporate and financial sectors. These steps are critical to ensure a steady and\nsustainable flow of private and strategic direct investments through domestic as well foreign\nsources, and attract nonbank sources of financing corporate growth in view of the decline in\npublic investments and banking sector limitations. The extent of judicial problems demonstrates\nthat training or capacity building alone will not be meaningful, in the absence of measures to\naddress other deep-rooted constraints. The enterprise sector problems stem partly from lack of\na coordinated Government strategy. The viability of a core of the enterprise sector needs to be\nguaranteed to facilitate the adoption of good internal governance practices. In line with these\nlessons, the proposed Program will help the Government in promoting (i) a conducive and\ntransparent environment in which enterprises and financial institutions can function efficiently\nand remain viable, and (ii) a sound legal framework and a well-functioning judicial and law\nenforcement system to enhance public confidence and assure domestic and foreign investors\nthat their assets will be protected. The urgent need for attracting domestic as well as foreign\nprivate investments was recently underscored in the background work undertaken for the CDF", "20\nprocess. ADB, along with other funding agencies, took an active part in the CDF deliberations,\nincluding those on sustainable measures to promote good governance.33\nB.  Objective and Scope\n61. The  Program  aims  to  enhance  investor  confidence  and  promote  the  efficiency  of\nenterprises by strengthening corporate, financial, and judicial governance.  To achieve this\nobjective, the Program will (i) promote, strengthen, and implement good corporate governance\nthrough development of a policy, institutional, legal, and regulatory framework; (ii) introduce\ninternational  accounting,  auditing,  and  valuation  standards;  (iii)  strengthen  governance  of\ncommercial banks and the legal framework to protect creditors' rights; (iv) launch legal and\njudicial reforms to introduce arbitration as a mechanism for resolving commercial disputes, and\nstreamline judicial processes and procedures; and (v) facilitate expedient resolution of weak\nenterprises.\nC. Policy Framework and Actions34\n62. While CGERP laid the foundation for corporate governance, good governance is viewed\nas a public good in the current transition environment in the Kyrgyz Republic. Given the slow\nprogress on privatization, enterprises are still not fully developed, viable, or market-oriented.\nThe financial markets are not mature yet, and investors generally are not sophisticated enough\nto fully appreciate the need for sound governance structures and internal control processes in\nenterprises. Regulatory capacity needs significant strengthening, and self-regulation by market\nplayers is a new concept. In view of these factors, the Government has a major role to play in\nensuring  that  enterprises  and  financial  markets  embrace  good  corporate  and  financial\ngovernance standards. Its efforts in promoting good governance need to be supplemented by\nconcurrent judicial reforms and initiatives to ensure and sustain the enterprise sector\u2019s viability.\nInstitutional  capacity  building  for  development  as  well  as  regulating  corporate  governance\nnorms, developing consensus for reforms in legal and judicial areas, and formulating feasible\noptions for restructuring enterprises have been at the center of ADB's policy dialogue with the\nGovernment. ADB has closely coordinated with senior-most officials in the President's and\nPrime Minister's administrations, and provided TA support in formulating the Program. The\nreform areas and the policy measures are presented in detail in the policy matrix (Appendix 2)\nand the program framework (Appendix 3). A description of the policy actions under the first and\nsecond tranches of the Program follows.\n1.  Promote,  Strengthen,  and  Implement  Good  Corporate  Governance\nStandards\n63. Develop  the  Policy  and  Institutional  Framework,  and  Enhance  Capacity  to\nImplement Good Governance Standards. Under the Program, the CDC has been elevated to\nthe  status  of  a  full  department  the  Prime  Minister's  Office  (PMO)35  and  will  perform  two\nimportant roles: (i) coordinate and implement the Program, for which its location in the PMO will\n                                        \n33 ADB made presentations on corporate and financial governance at the CDF Workshop on Good Governance, held\nin Bishkek in July 2000.\n34 TA 3505-KGZ (footnote 3) provided consulting and advisory support in formulating the framework, as well as\nassisted the Government in complying with the first tranche conditions and drafting of new legislation and\namendments to current laws, as required under the Program.\n35 The CDC was established under CGERP as a unit within the Department of Economic and Sector Development in\nthe PMO. Subsequently, in July 2000, the Government moved the CDC to CSPFI for budgetary considerations as\nwell as to support enterprise restructuring initiatives.", "21\nbe critical; and (ii) undertake training, capacity building, and information dissemination in all\nareas of corporate sector development. The CDC's skills mix has been strengthened and a two\nyear work program has been prepared, focusing on (i) management development and training;36\n(ii) public education and information campaign on corporate governance; (iii) implementation of\nthe new asset valuation standards; (iv) development of a corporate governance rating system;\nand (v) monitoring legal and regulatory developments with regard to corporate and financial\ngovernance.37  In  line  with  the  plan,  the  CDC  will  strengthen  its  initiatives  in  management\ndevelopment, training, and advisory support for enterprises, based on partial cost recovery to\nensure its financial sustainability in the long run, so that it could eventually be privatized.\nCorporate Herald, a Russian language monthly newspaper, will disseminate information on\ncorporate governance, management, finance, accounting, and valuation standards. The CDC\nwill also provide advisory support to minority shareholders. In addition, the CDC will develop a\ncorporate governance rating system for large enterprises, satisfactory to ADB, and publish by\nDecember 2002 the first round of ratings on all enterprises listed on the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange\n(KSE) and all commercial banks. Further, the CDC in coordination with SCSM, will formulate a\nmedium-term plan for continued promotional activities in the sphere of corporate governance, in\nclose conformity with regulation. The plan will include sustainable venues where corporate\ngovernance activities can be anchored, including modalities for encouraging private sector\ninvolvement in this area.\n64. Strengthen the Policy Framework for SOE Governance. The Program will support\nmeasures to improve corporate governance and management of SOEs. The corporatized SOEs\nhave adopted the practices outlined in the handbook and MCC (para. 28).38 However, SOEs\nhave not effectively implemented the principles of good corporate governance, as evident from\nmany recent cases (e.g., ad hoc approach adopted to the reorganization of JSC Kyrgyz Gas\nMunaizat; renationalization of JSC Kyrgyz Bakai). The poor performance of a large number of\nSOEs is partly due to the lack of guidance and expertise of the members of the BOD, who are\nnot always appointed on the basis of merit or qualifications. The Program aims to (i) strengthen\nthe requirement on qualifications for members of SOEs' BOD, including state representatives;\n(ii) introduce a system of nomination committees for selecting candidates for the BOD and the\nBOM of SOEs; (iii) strengthen the requirements on disclosure of financial interests of members\nof the BOD and the BOM; (iv) establish contractual arrangements between SOEs and members\nof BOM, to ensure that a proper incentive structure is adopted; and (v) introduce clear indemnity\nrules, to ensure that directors or managers are not liable for decisions taken in the best interest\nof an SOE, after due inquiry as to relevant considerations and in good faith and based on good\nbusiness judgment.  Under the Program, the Government (through CSPFI) will have at least 10\nmajor SOEs (those with at least 51 percent of state ownership) adopt and continuously comply\nwith the above practices by December 2002.\n65. Strengthen the Legal and Regulatory Framework for Good Governance in JSCs.\nThe Parliament recently initiated amendments to the LEPS. The Government has drafted a new\n                                        \n36 This component will train enterprise officials in efficient enterprise management skills in a transition environment;\noperational and organizational strategies; principles of good corporate governance, including ethics, responsibility\nto shareholders, employees, and society at large; principles of corporate finance and modern marketing. In view of\nthe significant need for enterprise renewal, this component will include a component on motivating and educating\nworkers and managers for concerted action and renewal of enterprises (entitled Educare).\n37 The project implementation unit (PIU) will have a staff of three from PMO, who will be supported by advisory and\ntechnical inputs from a number of other ministers and agencies for coordinating and implementing the Program.\nThe promotional unit will be staffed by around 15 domestic consultants. The PMO will provide for the salary of\nGovernment staff and counterpart administrative expenses for CDC.\n38 See Supplementary Appendix A.", "22\nlaw on JSCs, that will focus exclusively on JSCs while the LEPS could effectively regulate the\nactivities of limited-liability companies. While this follows the practice adopted in other CARs\nand countries of the FSU, the draft law on JSCs also offers considerable improvements in the\nlegal framework with respect to good governance. Under the Program,39 the Government will\nadopt a sound legal framework for JSCs, whether an improved version of the LEPS or the draft\nlaw on JSCs, embodying certain sound principles of corporate governance (i) members of the\nBOD may be replaced only by shareholders at the general meeting or special meetings of\nshareholders;  (ii) the  BOD  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  establishing  policies  for  the\noperations of the JSCs and overseeing their implementation; (iii) indemnity rules for members of\nthe BOD and the BOM, to ensure that they are not penalized for sub-optimal outcomes if their\ndecisions are in the best interest of a JSC; and (iv) a JSC may repurchase its own shares only\non its volition or by contract. In addition, in view of the poor regulatory and monitoring processes\n(para. 29), the Program requires that the SCSM take steps to (i) develop its human resource\ncapacity in promotional as well as regulatory activities pertaining to corporate governance; (ii)\nensure  timely  submission  of  financial  information  and  reports  by  JSCs,  as  stipulated  in\nlegislation; (iii) strengthen its regulatory activities to ensure that JSCs comply with all relevant\nlegislation  and  regulation;  and  (iv)  periodically  monitor  the  conduct  of  AGMs  to  ensure\ncompliance with the legal provisions on AGMs.\n2.  Introduce International Accounting, Auditing and Valuation Standards\n66. Harmonize  National  Accounting  and  Auditing  Standards  with  Corresponding\nInternational Standards. Under the Program, SCSFRA has (i) fully adopted IAS 2001 with\nproper licensing from the IAS Committee; (ii) initiated the process for adopting fully International\nAuditing  Standards  2001;  (iii)  initiated  a  review  of  all  relevant  legislation,  codes,  and\nGovernment resolutions and decrees, pertaining to the financial sector and taxation, to ensure\nconsistency with IAS 2001 and International Auditing Standards 2001; and (iv) prepared, and\nadopted through a Government resolution, a realistic timetable for conversion of all JSCs and\nother  enterprises  to  the  new  standards.  Further,  over  the  Program  period,  SCSFRA  will\n(i) enhance its capacity to implement IAS 2001 and International Auditing Standards 2001 and\ndemonstrate satisfactory progress in the adoption of these standards; and (ii) ensure, with\nGovernment support, conversion to IAS 2001 of all enterprises listed on the KSE and all\ncommercial banks.\n67. The  Government,  through  SCSFRA,  has  submitted  to  Parliament  a  new  Law  on\nAccounting,  which  provides  a  sound  legal  framework  for  introducing  modern  accounting\nmethods and practices, and amendments to the Law on Auditing (1998) to ensure conformity\nwith the Law on Accounting. Under the Program, the Law on Accounting and amendments to\nthe Law on Auditing will be adopted by July 2002. Further, the Government, through the State\nTax Inspectorate, will (i) train a core group of its tax inspectors on IAS 2001; and (ii) accept\nfinancial  statements  based  only  on  IAS  2001  for  all  enterprises  listed  on  KSE  and  all\ncommercial banks for the financial year 2002.\n68. Formulate  National  Standards  on  Valuation  of  Assets.  Under  the  Program,  a\nvaluation standards committee and the CDC have drafted documents for introducing national\nstandards on valuation of movable, immovable, and nonmaterial assets. The documents include\nbasic provisions on asset valuation, requirements for valuers, standards for asset appraisal,\n                                        \n39 Advisory support has been provided under TA 3505-KGZ (footnote 3). While it is envisaged that the new law on\nJSCs, if adopted, will automatically replace the provisions on JSCs in the LEPS, follow-up advisory support will be\nprovided to ensure that there is no legal and regulatory arbitrage between the two laws.", "23\nvaluation standards for functional enterprises, and valuation of intellectual property. A draft law\non asset valuation and the associated regulations have been prepared, along with amendments\nto the Law on Licensing to strengthen the provisions on licensing of asset valuation activities. By\nthe third quarter of 2002, the Government will submit these laws to the Parliament, following\nwhich the national standards on valuation will be adopted. By December 2002, the CSPFI will\nhave completed reevaluation of the physical and financial assets of three large SOEs, based on\nthe new standards.\n3.  Strengthen Governance of Commercial Banks and the Legal Framework to\nEnhance Creditors' Rights\n69. Improve  Banking  Sector  Governance.  Strengthening  the  internal  corporate\ngovernance standards of commercial banks is critical to improve their operational and financial\nmanagement. Adherence of a bank's BOD and BOM to good corporate governance essentially\nrequires  the  preparation  and  adoption  of  an  appropriate  strategic  plan,  identification  and\neffective management of credit, market, and operational risks; and measuring performance\nagainst the objectives of the strategic plan. For such practices to be effectively implemented,\nsignificant  shareholders  and  members  of  the  BOD  and  the  BOM  must  have  the  requisite\nknowledge  and  experience  in  bank  governance  and  the  determination  to  pursue  proper\ngovernance standards. The LEPS and the draft law on JSCs contain general provisions on\nqualifications of members and composition of the BOD and the BOM. However, courts in the\nKyrgyz Republic generally tend to focus on specific legislation, and particularly on exemptions in\nsuch legislation.\n70. To  address  these  issues,  the  Program  supports  amendments  to  LBBA  to  require\n(i) principal shareholders and members of the BOD and the BOM to comply with the stipulated\nqualification requirements on an ongoing basis; (ii) allocation of at least one BOD position to an\nindependent director;40 (iii) obligatory committees of the BOD for risk management, managerial\ncompensation, and director nominations; (iv) the establishment of an explicit fiduciary duty for\nbanks and members of the two boards; (v) disclosure of the financial interests of members of\nthe two boards; (vi) rules to avoid exploitation of conflict of interest by directors and managers;\nand (vii) nonpreferential treatment of banks' transactions with related parties. The NBKR under\nthe Program will amend its regulations (consistent with the amendments in the LBBA) by\nDecember 2002 to strengthen the governance of commercial banks and submit a report to ADB\non banks compliance with the enhanced provisions in these regulations and the LBBA.\n71. Under the Program, the Government will strengthen the role of the Debt Restructuring\nAgency and assign all bank liquidation functions to it. Besides facilitating the liquidation process,\nit will also relieve NBKR\u2019s burden regarding appointment of its legal and supervision staff as\nspecial administrators in banks placed on liquidation. Further, a separate law on bankruptcy of\nbanks will be drafted and submitted to the Parliament by December 2002. This law will address\nthe constraints on resolution of insolvent banks (para. 35) and facilitate liquidation as well as\nrecovery of assets.\n                                        \n40 As per LEPS and LBBA, BODs should have a minimum of five members; under the Program, at least one of these\npositions will be reserved for independent members, who will be from the private sector and independent of the\nmanagement of the bank and shareholders who own more than five percent of any class of voting shares of the\nbank. Independent in this context means not related to company management or principal shareholders by family\nties (through marriage or consanguinity to the second degree), or through common investment or business interest.", "24\n72. Protect the Rights of Creditors and Pledge-Holders. The Kyrgyz Law on Pledges\ncompares favorably with that found in other CARs and countries of the FSU. However, the law\nappears to be ineffective, due partly to the inconsistencies between it and other legislation, and\nalso because of deficiencies in the court processes and the pledge execution system (para. 36).\nUnder  the  Program,  the  Government  will  (i)  remove  inconsistencies  between  the  Law  on\nPledges and the Civil Code, and the Civil Code and other legislation (including the Law on\nMortgage), by amending the Civil Code to facilitate the application and enforcement of the Law\non Pledges; (ii) allow the pledger to execute collateral without court intervention, and limit the\ngrounds on which appeals to courts by a defaulting party may be made; (iii) ensure that the\npriority of pledges is not affected by rules relating to execution of court actions by non-secured\ncreditors; (iv) clarify and simplify the process of notarization and registration of rights to pledges;\n(v) simplify the procedures for the sale of pledged assets, including the bidding and auction\nrequirements; and (vi) rationalize the structure of fees for execution of pledge rights.41\n4.  Launch Legal and Judicial Reforms to Enhance Governance\n73. The problems of the judicial and court system are multifaceted, ranging from excessive\nreliance on procedures to poor protection for parties involved in a commercial transaction to\njudicial complexities. To address these issues and to formulate measures to enhance public and\ninvestor confidence by reforming the judiciary and improving existing legislation as well as its\nenforcement,  the  President  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  under  the  Program,  established  a\nConsultative Judicial Reform Group (CJRG). The CJRG, comprising public and private sector\nparticipants, has produced a Report on Judicial Reforms, based on a set of terms of reference\n(TORs) agreed to by the Government and ADB (Appendix 6).42 The CJRG deliberated on a\nnumber of sensitive issues and its report (Supplementary Appendix C) presents indicative\ndirections to strengthen the judiciary. The CJRG advocates reforms to (i) allow extrajudicial\nresolution  of  commercial  disputes  (i.e.,  arbitration);  (ii) enhance  transparency  of  judicial\nproceedings; (iii) develop a framework to deal with judicial corruption; (iv) build up a professional\ncorps  of  judges;  (v)  separate  the  executive  from  judicial  appointments  and  dismissals,  by\ndesigning a system of parliamentary appointment of judges at all levels; (vi) streamline court\nappellate  and  other  procedures;  and  (vii)  rationalize  the  court  fees,  funding,  and  salary\nstructures. These and other broad judicial reform directions were also addressed in the CDF\ndocument endorsed by the President in May 2001.43 The President in July 2001 endorsed and\napproved the findings and recommendations of the CJRG.44\n74. Under  the  Program,  the  Government  has  formulated  a  suitable  implementation\nframework to oversee judicial reforms. A Judicial Reform Monitoring Group (JRMG) has been\n                                        \n41 Advisory support has been provided under TA 3505 (footnote 3) to prepare draft amendments to the Civil Code,\nLaw on Mortgage, Law on Pledges and other relevant legislation, and a new draft law on secured obligations for\nthe Government\u2019s consideration. The NBKR will coordinate work in this area, in consultation with a working group\nestablished for the purpose.\n42 Appendix 6 presents the Presidential Disposition No.128, dated 13 April 2001, and the terms of reference for the\nCJRG. An ADB adviser (under TA 3505) and the project director of the ongoing Commercial Law Project of the\nUSAID participated as observers at the CJRG's meetings. While neither ADB nor the advisers took part in\nformulating the recommendations, background papers were prepared to guide the group's discussions.\n43 The President also highlighted the need for pursuing judicial reforms in his May 2001 speech to an annual\nconvention of judges, and underscored the need for adopting the CJRG's recommendations at an investor\nroundtable organized by the Embassy of the United States of America and the European Union in July 2001.\n44 Through President\u2019s Disposition No. 220, dated 12 July 2001.", "25\nestablished and an action plan adopted to implement the recommendations of the CJRG,\nthrough President\u2019s Dispositions.45 The JRMG will coordinate and monitor the implementation of\nthe judicial reform measures under the Program, and submit bi-annual reports to ADB.\n75. To  undertake  more  in-depth  diagnostic  work  to  operationalize  the  CJRG's\nrecommendations, the President, under the Program, has also established a Judicial Advisory\nCommission (JAC) with broad-based participation, comprising judges, lawyers from the private\nsector, legal scholars, parliamentary deputies, and members of civil society.46 The JAC will (i)\nwidely disseminate the CJRG report and hold workshops on its recommendations in Bishkek\nand at least three other regional centers; (ii) undertake a comprehensive diagnostic study of the\nlegal  and  judicial  sector  (with  ADB  TA  support)  to  improve  the  quality,  transparency,  and\nefficiency of the judicial system, in line with the judicial reform measures outlined in the CDF\nand CJRG reports; and (iii) organize a major participatory workshop to discuss the findings and\nrecommendations of the diagnostic study, with representatives from the judiciary, civil society,\nprivate sector, and the aid community.\n76. Allow Out-of-Court Resolution of Commercial Disputes. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the\nConstitution precludes arbitration by third parties. Commercial disputes can be settled only by a\ncourt (in the ACS, or a court of general jurisdiction). Given the widespread problems in the\njudicial system and with the execution of court judgments, the Program will support out-of-court\narbitration for resolution of commercial disputes to provide an efficient alternative to the ACS, if\nthe parties to a transaction so wish. Recognizing this, the President recently issued a decree on\narbitration of land disputes. The need for arbitration is also articulated in the CDF documents.\nUnder the Program, amendments have been drafted to appropriate legislation, including the\nConstitution  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  to  recognize  and  allow  extrajudicial  resolution  of\ncommercial disputes. Further, a new law on extrajudicial resolution of disputes, to establish the\nprocedural and legal formalities and also deal with the enforcement of foreign as well as local\narbitral awards, has also been drafted. The Government has undertaken to enact the new and\namended  legislation  by  December  2002.  Once  the  legal  framework  for  arbitration  is\nstrengthened, it is envisaged that the private sector will provide arbitration services.\n77. Streamline Court Appellate Procedures and Processes to Increase Efficiency. The\nprocess of judicial decision making in the ACS and the courts of general jurisdiction needs to be\nstreamlined. There is lack of clarity over \"matters of principle or law\" versus \"matters of fact,\"\nwhen cases are presented for appeal or supervision. Further, it is unclear why appeals should\nbe supervised. These problems have been further compounded by the recent Constitutional\nCourt rulings on appellate procedures. Under the Program, the Government will, by December\n2002, amend relevant legislation, including the Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic, to allow\nhigher courts the power to render judgments with finality and efficiency.\n78. The Government will also undertake initial measures to increase the transparency of\njudicial proceedings. Under the Program, it will develop mechanisms, including coordination with\nthe private sector (e.g., the Toktom Database47) to disseminate the decisions reached within the\n                                        \n45 The JRMG, established through President\u2019s Disposition No. 239, dated 7 August 2001, will be chaired by the\nPresident's Chief of Staff. In addition, it comprises the heads of the legal departments of the President's and Prime\nMinister's offices, and the Minister of Justice. The action plan, adopted through President\u2019s Disposition No.282,\ndated 5 October 2001, nominates various ministries and agencies to prepare draft legislation and undertake the\nother tasks as outlined in the CJRG\u2019s report.\n46 Through President\u2019s Disposition No.281, dated 5 October 2001.\n47 Toktom is a private sector provider of legal and judicial sector information through the print and computer media. It\nis a locally incorporated company.", "26\nACS and other courts of general jurisdiction. The JAC will focus on other issues relating to\ntransparency and formulate a comprehensive strategy to deal with publications, establishing\njudicial precedence, and public participation during court trials.\n5. Facilitate Expedient Resolution of Weak Enterprises in the Industry Sector\n79. Formulate  a  Sound  Legal  and  Policy  Framework  for  Resolution  of  Weak\nEnterprises.  The  extent  of  nonviability  in  the  industry  sector  demonstrates  the  need  for\nstrengthening the policy and legal framework to facilitate speedier resolution of operational and\nfinancial problems in enterprises. The Program will support measures in three different areas\n(i) adoption  of  a  Government  resolution  to  require  overindebted  SOEs  and  private  sector\nenterprises with significant outstanding arrears on past loans, social security contributions, or\ntax payments to the Government, to initiate automatic restructuring on their own and facilitate\nopportunities  for  reorganization  as  an  alternative  to  liquidation  in  appropriate  cases;  (ii)\nformulation and adoption of an industry sector restructuring strategy, based on the operational\nand financial assessment of 65 large enterprises; and (iii) expedient resolution of at least six\nenterprises that have significant operational and financial problems, with both reorganization\nand liquidation as options.\n80. Most of the enterprise resolution attempts over the last four years have resulted in\nliquidation.  While  this  may  be  due  to  the  extent  of  insolvency  in  the  sector,  the  Law  on\nBankruptcy appears to encourage liquidation over other forms of enterprise reorganization,\nthough bankruptcy cases take longer to move through the court system, as not all judges\nunderstand clearly the financial nuances. In view of the complexities and delays, under the\nProgram the most nonviable SOEs are expected to take their own initiatives for restructuring. To\nsupport this, the CSPFI will (i) introduce amendments to the Law on Bankruptcy to facilitate\nspeedier resolution of weak enterprises, and (ii) issue a Government resolution mandating over-\nindebted SOEs in which the Government owns more than 51 percent, and other enterprises with\nlarge overdue State debts to develop a comprehensive restructuring plan. If the plan is not\nsatisfactory to the creditors, or if no such plan is developed by an overindebted SOE, the\nGovernment will appoint a receiver for the sale of the enterprise or piecemeal liquidation of\nassets. Under the Program, the CSPFI will also increase its monitoring capacity in all aspects of\nenterprise restructuring, including liquidation as well as operational or financial renewal, and\ntake steps to strengthen its existing database on enterprises being reorganized or liquidated\nand the court actions taken.\n81. The Government, under the Program, will formulate an industry sector restructuring\nstrategy focusing on (i) capacity utilization; and (ii) medium-term commercial, financial, and\noperational viability. To implement the sector strategy, the CDC and CSPFI will initiate a public\ninformation campaign on provisions available for efficient enterprise restructuring, aimed at\ndispelling the current negative notions on restructuring. Further, to promote transparency, the\nCSPFI will publish under the Program biannual reports starting in December 2002 on (i) all\nenterprise restructuring proceedings in the mass media; and (ii) the JSC Kyrgyz Gas Munaizat\nbankruptcy process, giving clear and transparent information, until the process is completed.\n82. The Government has carried out an operational and financial viability assessment of\n65 enterprises with support under ADB TA (para. 50 and footnote 29). Ten enterprises, with\nsignificant  operational  and  financial  problems,  were  studied  in  depth  and  comprehensive", "27\nrecommendations submitted to the Government for their resolution.48  The Government, before\nADB\u2019s Board consideration of the Program, will initiate steps towards (i) sale of JSC Osh\nTextiles to a strategic investor; (ii) cross-ownership arrangement with key suppliers of JSC\nKyrgyz Chemical and Metallurgy Plant; (iii) sale of 100 percent state shares in JSC Crystal to a\nstrategic investor; (iv) sale of all state shares in JSC Kainda Cable to a strategic investor; (v)\npreparation of a comprehensive restructuring plan, focusing on financial restructuring options for\nJSC Oremi. These measures will address the immediate problems facing some of the weakest\nenterprises. Following these initial steps, the Government, by December 2002, will have taken\nfurther measures to achieve satisfactory resolution through restructuring or liquidation of at least\nsix operationally and financially weak enterprises.\n83. The resolution measures proposed for the weak enterprises in the Program are based\non an in-depth analysis of the operational, financial, and human resource issues. As indicated in\npara. 85, the measures proposed in the Program will not have any adverse impact on the\nworkers of the concerned JSCs. However, since the adoption of the industry sector strategy by\nthe Government (para. 81) could have a short-term impact on employment, the Ministry of Labor\nwill formulate and implement adequate safety-net measures. Accordingly, adequate provisions\nwill be made in the 2002 budget for active labor market measures, including employment\ncounseling and retraining. The Ministry of Finance will also make sufficient provisions in the\n2003-2004 budgets for these measures.\nD. Social and Environmental Issues\n84. The thematic classification of the Program is economic growth. It aims to strengthen\ngovernance,  one  of  the  three  pillars  of  the  poverty  reduction  strategy.  Sound  corporate\ngovernance in enterprises and banking institutions will help reduce losses in the public sector,\nwhich  in  turn  compress  public  expenditures  that  are  critically  needed  to  support  poverty\nreduction and social development. Enhanced corporate governance has the added advantage\nof protecting small investors, depositors, and pensioners who, through mutual funds, invest in\nenterprises.  While the judicial reform measures under the Program will focus on commercial\ndispute resolution, the strengthening of judicial processes and procedures will have an impact\non protecting the interests of all.\n85. With  regard  to  resolution  of  weak  enterprises,  the  Program  proposes  a  phased\napproach, consisting of (i) operational or management restructuring; (ii) financial restructuring;\nor (iii) liquidation, if both (i) and (ii) fail. While some retrenchments will be unavoidable, it is\nimperative that the operational and financial problems in some of the most nonviable and loss-\nincurring enterprises be resolved or the enterprises liquidated. Further, a fairly large number of\nworkers in the targeted enterprises have already gone on unpaid leave and the rest receive their\nwages primarily in kind. The Program will support the provision of training and employment\ncounseling, to assist the affected workers. Overall, restructuring of the selected enterprises in\nparticular, and other loss-incurring and nonviable enterprises in general will contribute in the\nmedium  to  long  term  to  improvements  in  efficiency  in  resource  use,  and  help  rationalize\ninvestments and priorities, increase economic growth, and generate employment opportunities.\nReduced government expenditures on SOEs will free up revenues for social services and\nexpenditures, including allocations for supportive labor market measures.\n                                        \n48 Tables 1 to 10 in Supplementary Appendix D provide in-depth information on JSC Osh Textiles, JSC Zanar, JSC\nKyrygz Chemical and Metallurgy Plant, JSC Kainda Cable, JSC Oremi, JSC Kyrgyz Worsted Wool Plant, JSC\nCrystal, JSC Kyrgyzfarfor, JSC Linoleum, and JSC Jyldyz.", "28\n86. A full poverty impact assessment was undertaken for the Program (Appendix 7). Overall,\nthe Program will have a positive net effect on the poor. The poverty classification of the Program\nis  \"Other.\"  The  environmental  implications  were  reviewed,  and  no  significant  adverse\nenvironmental impacts were identified. Hence, the Program is classified under category C for\nenvironmental assessment.\nVI. THE PROPOSED LOAN\nA.  Amount of Loan and Source of Funds\n87. It is proposed that ADB support the Government's policy reforms by providing a loan of\nSpecial Drawing Rights (SDR)27,398,000 ($35 million equivalent) from ADB's Special Funds\nresources. The Borrower will be the Kyrgyz Republic. The loan size was determined on the\nbasis of the importance and need for sound corporate governance standards, a well-functioning\njudiciary and a viable industry sector, and the costs of the proposed structural reforms. The\nlatter are estimated at about $35.8 million during 2001-2004, and will consist of the following\ncomponents:\n(i)  institutional capacity building for corporate governance, through additional\ninvestments in the CDC, SCSM, and CSPFI  ($2 million);\n(ii)  costs of institutional, capacity building, and administrative reforms linked\nto the judiciary, from CJRG and JAC deliberations (e.g., changing the\nsystem of judicial training; salary reforms over a medium term of five\nyears, etc.,) ($8 million);\n(iii)  write-offs for tax and social security payments, defaults on principal and\ninterest repayments on loans owed by nonviable SOEs and overindebted\nprivate sector enterprises to the budget, and loss of potential dividends\n($22.8 million);49\n(iv)  retraining  costs  for  workers  laid  off  in  restructured  and  liquidated\nenterprises ($0.25 million); and\n(v)  capacity building for implementing and monitoring IAS, and regulating\nJSCs ($3 million).\nB.  Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n88. The loan will have a 24-year maturity, including an 8-year grace period. The loan will\ncarry an annual interest charge of 1 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter.\n89. The  loan  is  expected  to  be  used  over  a  period  of  36  months  from  the  date  of\neffectiveness. Its proceeds may be used to finance eligible imports incurred within 180 days\nbefore the date of loan effectiveness.\nC. Implementation Arrangements\n90. The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency for the Program, and will be\nresponsible for administering and disbursing the loan proceeds and maintaining records.\n                                        \n49  These are calculated on the following basis: JSC Osh Textiles - Som457 million ($9.6 million); JSC Zanar - Som42\nmillion ($0.9 million); JSC Kyrgyz Chemical and Metallurgy Plant - Som41 million ($0.9 million); JSC Kainda Cable\n- Som5 million ($0.1 million); JSC Oremi - Som383 million ($8 million); and past irrecoverable investments in JSC\nCrystal - Som160 million ($3.3 million).", "29\n91. The CDC in the PMO will be the Implementing Agency and will provide quarterly reports\non the progress of the Program. It will be supported by a consultative council, chaired by the\nchief of staff of the PMO and comprising all the key ministries and State agencies, including\nCSPFI, Ministry of External Trade and Industry, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Finance, NBKR,\nSCSM, and SCSFRA. Each ministry or agency will deal with the policy, legal, and regulatory\ncomponent relevant to them, under the overall coordination of the CDC and the PMO. Further,\neach ministry and agency will nominate staff to work closely with the CDC for 18 months on\nimplementing the Program. The judicial reform component will be overseen and implemented by\nthe JRMG, with appropriate inputs provided by the consultative council, to ensure coordination\nwith the overall objective and scope of the Program. The JRMG will coordinate closely with the\nCDC and the Ministry of Justice, and submit bi-annual reports to ADB, focusing on, among other\nthings, progress made, problems encountered, remedial actions taken during the previous six-\nmonths, and proposed program activity and expected progress during the next six-months.\nD. Procurement and Disbursement\n92. In line with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for program\nloans,50 and considering economy and efficiency, goods and services produced and originating\nin  ADB's  member  countries  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  standard  public  sector\nprocedures of the Kyrgyz Republic and normal private sector commercial practices acceptable\nto ADB. Goods commonly traded on the international commodity markets will be procured in\naccordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.\n93. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject to a\nnegative list of items.51 Loan proceeds will be disbursed on the basis of a certification provided\nby the Government, confirming that in each year in which the proceeds of the program loan are\nexpected to be disbursed, the value of total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember countries\nof  ADB  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports  financed  under  other  official  development\nassistance, is equal to or greater than the amounts expected to be disbursed during such year.\n94. If  appropriate  procedures  are  not  followed,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  withhold  the\ndisbursement  of  funds  or  seek  reimbursement.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  withdrawn  in\naccordance with ADB's standard disbursement procedures. ADB reserves the right to audit the\nuse of the loan proceeds and verify the validity of the certification issued by the Government.\nE.  Counterpart Funds\n95. The policy matrix for the Program includes specific components that bear distinct costs\nof structural adjustments. The counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will\nbe  used  to  finance  the  cost  of  such  structural  adjustments  and  high-priority  development\nprojects.\nF. Monitoring and Tranching\n96. The program period will be 3.5 years, from January 2001 to June 2004. The loan will be\nreleased in two equal tranches with the first tranche available upon loan effectiveness. The\nsecond tranche will be released by September 2003, subject to satisfactory implementation of\nthe  agreed-upon  conditions.  In  cooperation  with  the  PMO,  ADB  will  carry  out  semiannual\n                                        \n50  R50-98: Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, 16 April 1998.\n51 See Attachment 1 to Schedule 3 of the Loan Agreement on the Program between the Government and ADB.", "30\nreviews of progress in implementing the Program, and will assess its impact on the sectors\nrelevant to the Program, including the industry and banking sectors and the judiciary. The\nGovernment  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  outcomes  of  its  policy  discussions  with  other\nmultilateral and bilateral funding agencies that have implications for program implementation,\nand will give ADB the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals.\n97. In addition to quarterly progress reports, the CDC and the PMO will submit a program\ncompletion report to ADB within six months of the release of the second tranche. This report will\nevaluate the implementation of the policy reform measures under the Program; their impact on\nthe economy, industry and banking sectors, and the judiciary; lessons learned during the period;\nand further reforms and assistance needed for the development of the relevant sectors.\n98. The  policy  matrix  lists  18  actions  that  will  be  completed  before  ADB\u2019s  Board\nconsideration.  The  key  actions  include  strengthening  the  CDC,  adopting  a  Government\nresolution to strengthen SOE governance, fully adopting IAS 2001, drafting satisfactory laws on\naccounting and auditing, preparing asset valuation standards, drafting satisfactory amendments\nto  the  LBBA  to  improve  corporate  governance  of  commercial  banks;  initial  preparation  of\namendments to various laws to improve the legal and enforcement framework on pledges;\nestablishing a sound institutional framework to formulate and adopt judicial reforms; drafting\nsatisfactory amendments to existing legislation and preparing new draft legislation to allow\narbitration and streamline appellate court procedures; and formulating and adopting policy,\nlegal, and regulatory measures to achieve expedient resolution of operationally and financially\nweak enterprises.\n99. For the release of the second tranche, eight actions are required:\n(i)  The CDC will develop for large enterprises a corporate governance rating system\nsatisfactory to ADB, and publish the first set of ratings on all enterprises listed on\nthe KSE and all commercial banks.\n(ii)  At least 10 major SOEs (those with at least 51 percent of State ownership) will\nadopt and continuously comply with the good governance practices adopted\nunder the Program.\n(iii)  Legislation for JSCs, drafted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, will be enacted.\n(iv)  A Law on Accounting and an amended Law on Auditing, drafted in a manner\nsatisfactory to ADB, will be enacted.\n(v)  NBKR will amend its regulations to strengthen governance of commercial banks\nand submit to ADB a report on banks\u2019 compliance with the enhanced provisions\non corporate governance in the NBKR regulations and the Law on Banks and\nBanking Activity.\n(vi)  The JAC will (a) widely disseminate the CJRG report and conduct workshops on\nits recommendations in Bishkek and at least three regional centers; (b) undertake\na diagnostic study of the legal and judicial sector (with ADB TA support) to\nimprove the quality, transparency, and efficiency of the judicial system in line with\nthe judicial reform measures outlined in the CDF and the CJRG report; and\n(c) organize  a  major  participatory  workshop  to  discuss  the  findings  and\nrecommendations of the diagnostic study, with representatives from the judiciary,\ncivil society, the private sector, and the aid community.\n(vii)  Legislation will be amended and enacted to allow (a) third-party arbitration in line\nwith the recommendations in the CJRG report; such legislation among others,\nwill deal with the enforcement of foreign as well as local arbitral awards; and (b)\nhigher courts to render judgments with finality and efficiency.", "31\n(viii)  The  Government  will  take  steps  to  achieve  satisfactory  resolution,  including\nrestructuring  or  liquidation,  of  at  least  six  operationally  and  financially  weak\nenterprises, based on the assessment supported under the Program.\n100. The additional 14 monitorable conditions (Appendix 2) to be implemented during the\nProgram will represent important steps towards complying with the conditions for the release of\nthe second tranche.\nVII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n101. The TA will strengthen overall corporate and financial governance and judicial reforms in\nthe Kyrygz Republic by supporting (i) the adoption as well as monitoring of good governance\nnorms in all enterprises, (ii) adoption of modern accounting standards in all enterprises, and\n(iii) a  comprehensive  diagnostic  assessment  of  the  problems  and  constraints  facing  the\njudiciary.\n102. The TA (Appendix 8) will focus on institutional capacity building support for\n(i)  corporate  governance  reforms  focusing  on  support  for  enterprises  in\nmanagement development, finance, and internal controls;\n(ii)  developing a corporate governance rating system;\n(iii)  developing a sound institutional and regulatory framework for formulating and\nadopting corporate governance norms in all JSCs;\n(iv)  undertaking a comprehensive legal and judicial sector assessment, with focus on\nreducing the problems and constraints facing the judiciary; and\n(v)  monitoring implementation of the Program.\n103. The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent, of which $740,000 will be the foreign\nexchange cost and $260,000 equivalent will be the local currency component. ADB will finance\nthe equivalent of $850,000, comprising the entire foreign exchange component and $110,000\nequivalent of the local currency component. Financing will come from the ADB-funded TA\nProgram. The Government will provide $150,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office\nfacilities, and workshops.\n104. The CDC under the PMO will be the Executing Agency for the TA to be implemented\nover 15 months, starting by April 2002. The JRMG, in consultation with the JAC, will provide\noverall supervisory support for the judicial reform component. It is estimated that the TA will\nrequire 20.5 person-months international and 75 person-months domestic consulting support. In\naddition, the Government has committed to utilizing about $340,000 from the ongoing TA Loan\n1547, to procure advisory support services from an international consultant for 4 person-months\nfor the enterprise resolution component of the Program, and about 340 person-months domestic\nconsulting support for promoting corporate governance.52 All consultants will be selected in\naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB. The Government will select the consultants to be funded out of TA Loan\n1547  in  accordance  with  the  appropriate  loan  agreement.  The  CDC  will  supervise  the\nconsultants recruited under TA Loan 1547.\n                                        \n52The terms of reference for the consulting inputs to be procured under TA Loan 1547-KGZ (footnote 1) are in CDC's\naction plan.", "32\nVIII. PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Benefits\n105. The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  take  leadership  in  assisting  with  the\ndevelopment of a framework for corporate governance in the Kyrgyz Republic. CGERP has\ncontributed to a significant increase in awareness of basic corporate governance issues among\nenterprise and Government officials and, to some extent, among shareholders. The Program\nwill further strengthen the adoption of good governance practices in all JSCs, with focus on\nSOEs and commercial banks. The Program's broadened scope to reform the judiciary and\nrestructure nonviable enterprises is expected to have wide-ranging and sustained benefits.\n106. While the Kyrgyz Republic has developed a legal base over the last five years to support\nprivate  sector  development,  specific  problems  with  legislation  pertaining  to  enterprises,\ninconsistencies between legislation, and weaknesses in the regulatory and judicial framework\nhave  effectively  discouraged  investors  from  taking  risks.  In  addition,  due  to  the  poor\nmacroeconomic  environment  as  well  as  the  structural  problems  inherited  from  the  pre-\nindependence period, a large number of enterprises are nonviable. The Program will formulate\nmeasures to address all these constraints.\n107. The Program will support institutional capacity building in the SCSM and enhancement\nof its regulatory authority to effectively monitor compliance with good governance norms in all\nJSCs. The Program will facilitate privatization of large SOEs by supporting the preparation of a\nseparate  corporate  governance  framework  for  all  SOEs.  It  will  enhance  transparency  and\nfinancial integrity in the banking sector by clarifying and strengthening corporate governance\nprovisions in banking legislation, with specific focus on sound criteria for appointments to the\nBOD. The Program will also support the Government's measures to take prompt corrective\nactions on problem banks suffering from shareholder abuse and governance failures.\n108. With regard to the legal, regulatory, and judicial framework, the reform measures under\nthe Program aim to promote the credibility and professional standards of the judiciary so that the\njudicial decision-making and law enforcement process is unquestioned. A key expectation is\nthat public and investor confidence in the judiciary will be enhanced. By introducing alternative\nmethods of dispute resolution, the Program will encourage foreign investments in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic.\n109. The Program will help improve enterprise sector viability by supporting the Government's\nefforts in resolving long-standing problems of tax and social security payment arrears, and\ndefaults on loan repayments owed by a large number of enterprises. It will require greater\ncompliance by state organs with the provisions of the Law on Bankruptcy. Continuing the policy\nmeasures adopted under the FIRM Program, the Program seeks to enhance transparency in\nthe resolution of JSC Kyrgyz Gas Munaizat.\nB. Risks\n110. The  Program  faces  three  major  risks.  First,  given  the  small  market  size  and  the\ncontinuing dependence of the Kyrgyz economy on Russia, macroeconomic stability is critical to\nensure  that  structural  reforms  proceed  in  an  uninterrupted  manner  across  the  corporate,\nfinancial, and other sectors of the economy. Recognizing this, the Government, with support\nfrom IMF, continues to stress adherence to a macroeconomic stabilization program, which\nemphasizes improving fiscal, monetary, and external debt management. The fiscal deficit is to", "33\nbe reduced from 9.4 percent of GDP in 2000 to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2001. A tight monetary\npolicy will continue to be pursued. The Government is pursuing a multifold strategy to reduce\ndebt, including a tight fiscal policy and reducing the PIP.\n111. The  second  risk  pertains  to  the  resolution  of  weak  enterprises.  While  there  are\nsignificant enterprise-level vested interests that could prevent reorganization or liquidation, the\nGovernment fully recognizes the extent of nonviability in the industry sector. The Program\nproposes a gradual, phased-in approach to resolution, which involves a sequence of measures,\nincluding, among others, management change, reorganization and liquidation. This will enable\nthe Government to explore all plausible avenues and assure the stakeholders in the process.\n112. Third, being politically sensitive and prone to resistance from vested interests, legal and\njudicial  reforms  may  not  be  effectively  implemented.  Given  the  weaknesses  in  the  legal\nframework, the Program requires amendments to several laws. The judicial system suffers from\nsignificant procedural as well as systemic weaknesses and problems related to appointments,\ndismissals, and independence of judges. Some of the critical judicial reform measures require\namendments of a technical nature to the Kyrgyz Constitution. ADB has provided significant TA\nsupport to prepare new laws as well as amendments to legislation. To initiate judicial reforms,\nADB has closely worked with the Government to establish the CJRG under the President. The\nPresident subsequently endorsed the CJRG's report, which recommends wide-ranging reforms\nin the judiciary, including amending existing legislation to achieve those reforms. A sound\nimplementation  framework  has  also  been  agreed  upon  with  the  Government,  including\nestablishing the JAC to undertake an in-depth diagnostic assessment of the judicial problems.\n113. It  is  imperative  that  the  problems  and  constraints  facing  Kyrgyz  enterprises  be\naddressed  effectively  and  in  a  comprehensive  manner.  Governance  reforms  will  not  be\nmeaningful without strengthening the supporting legal and judicial framework. Reforming the\njudiciary is a complex task, but it is one to which the Kyrgyz President is now attaching\nsignificance, as outlined in his remarks at various judges\u2019 conventions and in the CDF report.\nThe Government fully recognizes the negative perceptions of investors, domestic as well as\nforeign,  and  is  willing  to  initiate  reforms  in  key  areas  to  enhance  confidence  in  domestic\ninstitutions. In particular, with the stated goal of achieving FDI of 15 percent of GDP by 2010,\nthe President of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Government are committed to strengthen the legal\nframework and attract investors. The Government has also, thus far, demonstrated strong\ncommitment by formulating the reform measures proposed under the Program. Taking these\nconsiderations into account, the Program will launch the first round of judicial reform initiatives in\nthe Kyrgyz Republic.\nIX. ASSURANCES\n114. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the loan agreement:\n(i)  The policies adopted and reform measures taken prior to the date of the loan\nagreement, as described in the development policy letter (Appendix 1) and the\npolicy matrix (Appendix 2), will continue in effect for the duration of the Program\nperiod.\n(ii)  The  measures  to  (a)  promote,  strengthen,  and  implement  good  corporate\ngovernance  standards;  (b)  introduce  international  accounting,  auditing,  and\nvaluation standards; (c) strengthen governance of commercial banks and the", "34\nlegal framework to protect creditors' rights; (d) launch legal and judicial reforms to\nenhance governance; and (e) restructure the enterprise sector, will be adopted in\naccordance with the policies and actions specified in the policy matrix, and the\nGovernment will ensure that such policies and actions continue in effect for the\nduration of the program period.\n(iii)  Sufficient  counterpart  funds  will  be  made  available  under  the  Program\ncomponents where such funds are required.\nX. RECOMMENDATION\n115. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  27,398,000  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Second  Phase  of  the\nCorporate Governance and Enterprise Reform Program, with a term of 24 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during\nthe grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as\nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to\nthe Board.\nTADAO CHINO\n         President\n25 October 2001", "35\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n36 2,6\n1 Development Policy Letter\n40 2,6\n2 Policy Matrix for the Second Phase of the Corporate\nGovernance and Enterprise Reform Program\n(CGERP-II)\n47 2,6\n3 Program Framework\n4 Background Information on the Enterprise Sector 54  7,22\n5 Scheme of the Kyrgyz Court System 58           8,25\n6 Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, and 59         24,73\nTerms of Reference for the Consultative Judicial\nReform Group\n7 Poverty Impact Assessment 63         28,86\n8 Technical Assistance to Strengthen Corporate 70         31,102\nGovernance and Judicial Reforms\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\nA Legal Framework for Enterprises in Kyrgyz Republic\nB Data on Kyrgyz Court System\nC Report of the Consultative Judicial Reform Group\nD Enterprise-Level Data from ADB Study\n(TA 3505: Corporate Governance and Enterprise\nReform Program Phase II)", "36 Appendix 1, page 1\nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER\nMr. Tadao Chino\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\nDear Mr. President,\n1. The  Government  of  Kyrgyz  Republic  (the  Government)  requested  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank in 2000 for support through a Program Loan to further strengthen corporate\ngovernance standards and facilitate the introduction of reform measures aimed at enhancing\ninvestor confidence in Kyrgyz Republic. The first Phase of the Corporate Governance and\nEnterprise  Reform  Program  (CGERP-I)  is  considered  by  the  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic as successful and pioneering, given that Kyrgyz Republic was among the first set of\ncountries to adopt corporate governance reforms and since all the objectives and conditions of\nthe program have been completely fulfilled. In this regard, the Government of the Kyrgyz\nRepublic  would  like  to  express  its  gratitude  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for\nsupporting us in improving the legal, regulatory and institutional environment to introduce good\ngovernance, as well as for implementing reforms to enhance the efficiency and viability of\nenterprises.\n2. The Government highly appreciates the efforts of the ADB in formulating the second\nphase of CGERP (CGERP-II), in response to our request. In our view, enhancing investor\nconfidence through corporate and judicial governance reforms and facilitating prompt corrective\nmeasures for problem enterprises are vital at present. In view of our planned reduction in the\npublic investment program, it is vital that the Government's efforts are now aimed at attracting\nprivate domestic and foreign investments. The measures being proposed under CGERP-II will\nresult in improving living standard of the population of the Republic, and help us in addressing\nthe challenges posed by poverty in the medium-term. In our opinion, the measures, taken in this\nfield by the ADB, including in our country, clearly reflect the core of your Organization\u2019s activity\nas an international institution working towards improving living standards and development of\nthe member-countries.\n3. CGERP-II  is  aimed  at  deepening  reforms  started  within  the  framework  of  the  first\nprogram. Most of the measures envisaged under the new Program are of a systemic character\nas the Program includes the following five key components: (i) promoting, strengthening and\nimplementing good corporate governance through development of policy, legal and monitoring\nframework; (ii) implementation of international accounting, auditing and valuation standards;\n(iii) enhancing  governance  of  commercial  banks  and  strengthening  the  legal  framework  to", "37 Appendix 1, page 2\nprotect creditors' rights; (iv) launching legal and judicial reforms to enable arbitration as a\nmechanism  for  resolution  of  commercial  disputes,  and  streamlining  judicial  processes  and\nprocedures; and (v) facilitating expedient resolution of weak and inefficient enterprises.\n4. The Government has closely coordinated with the Mission of the ADB, and we have\njointly formulated the Program framework and policy measures. The understandings reached at\neach stage of the Program have been reflected in Memoranda of Understanding between the\nGovernment  (represented  by  a  Consultative  Council  for  CGERP-II,  established  through  a\nGovernment Resolution) and the ADB (represented by the Mission).\n5. In our view, CGERP-II will make important contributions in two respects: (i) introducing\nactual, pro-active, measures to attract investments; as well as (ii) addressing issues of concern\nto, and the negative perception held by, the potential investors. Unfortunately, to the present\nday, several surveys and analyses of various international organizations have appraised the\nefficiency and transparency of the legal and judicial sector, and the law enforcement system to\nbe very low, particularly concerning the system of economic dispute resolution. In particular, the\nmatter  concerns  procedures  of  (the  inefficient  system)  judicial  decision-making  and  the\nnecessity to strengthen independence of the judicial system from external factors. Addressing\nthese issues will form a core pillar of CGERP-II.\n6. Through this Development Policy Letter (DPL), the Government hereby commits to take\nall the measures needed to meet the objectives and fulfill the scope of CGERP-II. A Policy\nMatrix, outlining these measures in detail, is attached to this DPL. The following sections outline\nthe measures that have already been implemented, as well as those that the Government will\nimplement during the course of CGERP-II. The DPL outlines some of the key measures, as an\nindication of the Government's strong commitment to the reforms being adopted under CGERP-\nII.\n7. Adoption  of  good  corporate  and  financial  governance  measures:  Under  the\nProgram, the Government will further enhance our institutional capacity in corporate governance\npolicy formulation and regulation. The Corporate Development Center (CDC), established under\nthe first phase, has been transferred as a full-fledged department under the Prime Minister's\nOffice, reporting directly to me. This will ensure that there is effective coordination under the\nProgram, as well as the diverse elements of good governance are all promoted well. The\nGovernment will also adopt a sound legal framework on joint stock companies (JSCs), in line\nwith international best practices. We will also improve the corporate governance practices in\nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs) under the Program. In particular, good governance practices\nwill be adopted, on a demonstration basis, in at least 10 major SOEs (those with at least 51\npercent of state ownership).\n8. Good accounting and auditing standards are a cornerstone of transparency and good\ngovernance.  Under  the  Program,  the  Government  will  fully  adopt  International  Accounting\nStandards (IAS) 2001 and International Auditing Standards (IAuS). There will also be a phased\nprogram of adoption of these international standards in all enterprises over the Program period.\nIn particular, all enterprises listed on the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange and all commercial banks will\nadopt IAS for the 2002 financial year. Asset valuation is at a nascent stage of development in\nKyrgyz Republic. We will adopt internationally accepted asset valuation standards under the\nProgram, and revalue assets of at least three large SOEs.\n9. The importance of sound financial intermediation cannot be understated, for availability\nof credit is critical for revival and growth of enterprises. While we have adopted financial sector", "38 Appendix 1, page 3\nstrengthening measures with ADB support in the past, in this Program, we will amend the Law\non Banks and Banking Activity to incorporate sound provisions on corporate governance in\nbanks. The Government will also undertake measures to facilitate swift resolution of problems in\nthe banking sector, including the adoption of a separate law on bankruptcy of commercial\nbanks.\n10. It is our assessment that the Kyrgyz Law on Pledge compares favorably with that found\nin other Central Asian Republics. However, we recognize that the law may be ineffective, due\npartly to the inconsistencies between this Law and other legislation, and also because of\ndeficiencies in the court processes and the pledge execution system. Under the Program, the\nGovernment  has  drafted  amendments  to:  (i)  remove  inconsistencies  between  the  Law  on\nPledge and the Civil Code, and the Civil Code and other legislation (including the Law on\nMortgage), by amending the Civil Code, to facilitate an easier application and enforcement of\nthe  Law  on  Pledge;  (ii)  allow  the  pledgor  to  execute  collateral  without  court  intervention;\n(iii) simplify the procedures for the sale of pledge assets, including the bidding and auction\nrequirements; and (iv) rationalize the structure of fees for execution of pledge rights. These\namendments will be enacted under the Program by December 2002.\n11. Launch legal and judicial sector reform measures: The Government recognizes the\nnegative investor perception with regard to the Kyrgyz judicial system. CGERP-II will support\nour own initiatives in alleviating such a negative perception. The importance of this issue was\nclearly expressed by President in his speech at the 4th congress of judges of the Kyrgyz\nRepublic and was set out in the resolution of the congress in May 2001. In consultation with the\nADB, the President established the Consultative Judicial Reform Group (CJRG) in April 2001.\nThe President endorsed the recommendations contained in the CJRG Report on 12 July 2001.\nThis is an important milestone in CGERP-II. The CJRG Report stipulates wide-ranging reforms\nin the judicial system, including (i) the necessity of introduction of arbitration for economic\ndispute resolution, as an alternative to dispute resolution in arbitrazh courts; (ii) granting of\nfinality to judicial judgements taken by higher courts; (iii) formulating a sound framework for\njudicial corruption; (iv) adoption of measures to promote a professional corps of judges in the\nfuture; and (v) enhancing judicial independence through election of judges at all levels by the\nParliament.  That the President has approved all these recommendations, including arbitration,\ngranting of finality to higher courts and election of judges, all of which require amendments to\nthe Kyrgyz Constitution, underscores our commitment to introducing wide-ranging reforms in\nthis area. These measures are also reflected in the Comprehensive Development Framework\n(CDF) Report, which sets out our long-term development vision.\n12. Based on the recommendations of the CJRG, the Government under the Program has\nundertaken several important steps. These include: (i) initiating the drafting of new legislation\nand  legislative  amendments  to  introduce  extra-judicial  dispute  resolution  mechanisms;\n(ii) streamlining  court  appellate  procedures;  (iii)  establishment  of  a  Judicial  Advisory\nCommission (JAC) to undertake a comprehensive diagnostic assessment of the legal and\njudicial sector problems; and (iv) measures to enhance transparency in the process of judicial\ndecision-making. Under the Program, a suitable implementation framework to oversee judicial\nreforms has been adopted. A Judicial Reform Monitoring Group (JRMG) and an institutional\nmechanism  for  drafting  legislative  amendments  have  been  formed  through  Presidential\nDispositions. The JRMG will coordinate and monitor the implementation of the judicial reform\nmeasures under the Program, and submit semi-annual reports to the ADB. The JAC with broad-\nbased  participation  will  widely  disseminate  the  findings  of  the  CJRG  and  undertake  a\ncomprehensive analysis of the problems and constraints facing the judiciary. This process will\nenable us to introduce broader and deeper reforms in the near future to strengthen our judiciary.", "39 Appendix 1, page 4\n13. Recognizing the extent of unviability in the industrial sector, the Government through the\nProgram will undertake measures in three different areas: (i) formulation and adoption of a legal\nframework  to  require  SOEs  to  initiate  automatic  restructuring  on  their  own  and  facilitate\nopportunities  for  reorganizations  as  an  alternative  to  liquidations  in  appropriate  cases;  (ii)\nformulation and adoption of an industrial sector strategy, based on an operational and financial\nassessment of 65 large enterprises (undertaken with ADB TA support); and (iii) resolution of at\nleast six enterprises, with both reorganization and liquidation as options.\n14. The Government will undertake measures towards: (i) sale of 100 percent of state\nshares in JSC Osh Textiles to a strategic investor; (ii) cross-ownership arrangement with key\nsuppliers of JSC Kyrgyz Chemical and Metallurgy Plant; (iii) sale of state shares in JSC Crystal\nto a strategic investor; (iv) sale of all state shares in JSC Kainda Cable to a strategic investor;\n(v)  preparation  of  a  comprehensive  restructuring  plan,  focusing  on  realistic  financial\nrestructuring options of JSC Oremi. In addition to these enterprises, the Government, in line with\nResolution No. 627 of 11 October 2001, will ensure that 8 other financially weak SOEs and\n9 heavily indebted private sector enterprises will initiate automatic restructuring on their own.\nFollowing these measures, the Government, by December 2002, will take steps to achieve full\nand satisfactory resolution of at least six enterprises, including reorganization, restructuring or\nliquidation, based on the above comprehensive assessment.\n15. I would like to assure you that the Government's full adoption of the Program is based on\nour  in-depth  analysis  and  recognition  of  the  problems  facing  the  Kyrgyz  economy.  The\nunderstandings that we have reached with the ADB are the results of much efforts and hard\nwork, and strong will and commitment on our part to the reforms. However, reforms in any area\nare complicated, particularly if the internal structures and organization of the state and the\neconomy are formed in a different manner to that found in more mature and market-oriented\neconomies. But I believe that our sincere efforts to strive for solving the current problems will\nallow the Kyrgyz Republic to achieve stable economic growth and improvements in the living\nstandard of the Republic\u2019s population in the nearest future. CGERP-II is poised to play a vital\nrole in this process and support us in our endeavors.\n16. Taking this opportunity, I would like to express my sincere respect and gratitude, on\nbehalf of Kyrgyz Republic, for the assistance being rendered by the Asian Development Bank\nand we, as a country, wish the ADB every success and achievement in all your planned tasks.\nYours sincerely,\nPrime Minister,\nKyrgyz Republic\nKurmanbek Bakiev\n18 October 2001", "POLICY MATRIX FOR THE\nSECOND PHASE OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND\nENTERPRISE REFORM PROGRAM (CGERP-II)\nObjective: The key objective will be to enhance investor confidence and promote efficiency of enterprises by strengthening corporate, financial, and\njudicial governance.

Many recent studies and surveys have pointed out that the general public, and both local\nand foreign investors have a very poor perception of the way the judiciary functions in the\nKyrgyz Republic. This seems to be the case particularly for dispute resolution in commercial\ncases.  According to this perception, which seems to be near-universal and is reported in many\nstudies, the main issues are (i) weaknesses and inefficiencies relative to the judicial decision-\nmaking process; and (ii) lack of independence of the judiciary, in the sense that there is said to\nbe possible judicial bias or exposure to various external influences including monetary and\nofficial influence.\n2.  Although it is impossible to verify these perceptions, if the Kyrgyz Republic desires to\npromote  vibrant  industry  and  enterprise  sectors,  and  to  attract  domestic  and  foreign\ninvestments, it is critical that the judicial decision-making and law enforcement process be held\nin the highest esteem. Regardless of the actual extent of the problems perceived by many\ndiverse sources, it is highly important that public and investor confidence in the judiciary be\nrestored and enhanced by introducing a range of effective measures to combat the perceptions\nreferred to above.  ADB also gives such measures highest importance and regards satisfactory\nprogress in their adoption as an important precondition for CGERP-II. The proposed initiative\nwill be coordinated jointly by ADB and the United States Agency for International Development\n(USAID).\n3. With these objectives in the background, the tasks of the CJRG are in the following\nareas:\n(i)  Process-Related  Weaknesses  in  the  Judiciary  (for  resolution  in  5-\n15 months).  The CJRG will conduct an in-depth review and analysis of the\nexisting  weaknesses  and  inefficiencies  in  the  commercial  dispute  resolution\nprocess. A sample of the problems that must be addressed includes (a) the\ncyclical nature of appeals in the arbitrazh process, between the appeals and\nsupervision stages, which leads to lack of finality and significant delays in the\nsettlement  of  disputes;  (b)  other  problems  in  the  appeals  and  supervision\nprocess, where the judiciary seems to rely heavily on what may seem to be\nunnecessary procedures in lieu of commercial expediency; (c) the court fee and\nfinancial  structure  in  the  Arbitrazh  Court  System  (ACS);  (d)  the  skills  and\nknowledge  actually  possessed  by  judges,  compared  with  what  they  should\npossess and how any deficiencies can be remedied; (e) the overburdening of the\nACS; (f) lack of efficient dispute resolution alternatives other than the ACS;  and\n(g) any other relevant matters identified by CJRG. CJRG will examine all relevant\nlegislation with regard to the above issues.\n(ii)  Systemic  Weaknesses  in  the  Judiciary  (for  initial  implementation  of  a\nreform  plan  within  15  months).    The  underlying  premise  here  is  that  the\njudiciary  has  to  function  in  a  fully  transparent  and  independent  manner  to\neliminate  the  perceptions  already  referred  to.  CJRG  will  undertake  a\ncomprehensive examination of the judicial and law enforcement system, focusing\non (a) how the procedures for nominating and appointing judges can help ensure", "62\nAppendix 6, page 4\nthat the members of the judiciary are seen to function in an independent manner;\n(b) the knowledge and skills mix that should be possessed by judges, and what\ntypes of capacity building will be needed; (c) what lasting changes can be made\nin  the  current  system  of  judicial  education,  initial  employment  training,  and\nrotation at junior levels in private or public spheres; (d) judicial compensation\nstructure; (e) introduction of legislation intended to promote the disclosure and\nprevention  of  improper  actions;  (f)  other  methods  of  preventing  external\ninfluences from affecting the independence of judges, including scrutiny of the\nfinancial affairs of judges and means to reduce political interference, publication\nof all judgments, opening courts to public viewing, and so on; (g) the methods by\nwhich judges allegedly guilty of misconduct may be subjected to judicial action;\n(h) problems with enforcement of judicial decisions in the court-executor system;\nand (i) whether the ongoing initiatives to establish an Institute of Ombudsman\ncould also promote transparency and disclosure in the judiciary and assist with\nthe tasks outlined herein.\n4. CJRG should produce a report, in form and substance satisfactory to the ADB, to be\nadopted as the view of the group. The report should be submitted to and approved by the\nPresident as an action plan for implementation by the Government. The report will (i) contain\nspecific measures and not only general discussions of principles, (ii) be action-oriented, and\n(iii) include a package of measures intended to deal with the issues above and any others that\nCJRG thinks are relevant, with a time-based action plan for implementing the package within\nthe given period.  Where legislation is proposed, the report will include the main principles to be\nadopted in the legislation. In the case of systemic weaknesses, the action plan should be ready\nfor implementation in 15 months and should have a clear timetable for completion\u2014 not more\nthan 5 years\u2014if such period is necessary for full implementation, together with provisions for\nregular review and verification of progress made. The report should be produced and submitted\nto  the  President  no  later  than  30  May  2001  and  simultaneously  delivered  to  ADB.  The\nPresident\u2019s office will notify ADB of the date of President\u2019s approval of the report, which should\nbe prior to ADB\u2019s proceeding with further appraisal of CGERP-II.\n5. CJRG  will  be  participatory,  broad-based,  and  multidisciplinary.  It  will  include\nrepresentatives of the Government, the judiciary, private sector, as well as nongovernment\norganizations. Since it is important that all members of CJRG, once nominated, attend regularly,\nefforts will be devoted to ensuring this objective. Because of urgency of the task, meetings\nshould be held not less than 3 times a week, from 9 to 12 noon. Accordingly, the nominating\nbodies must ensure that their representatives are given the opportunity to attend. Discussions at\nCJRG must be frank yet confidential, given the sensitivity of the subject. All participants and\nthose working with CJRG must be guaranteed freedom to express their views without fear of\npunishment.\n6. ADB and USAID will organize support in the form of foreign lawyers and some local\nlawyers who will produce working papers for CJRG.  The working papers will set out a series of\nissues and possible objectives, with discussions of principles and comparisons with practices\nand approaches adopted elsewhere. However, CJRG and not the foreign lawyers, will decide on\nwhat to include in the report in order to produce a report satisfactory to ADB. Once CJRG has\nreached its conclusions, the foreign lawyers will assist in writing the conclusions and will present\nthem to the Group for confirmation, before the report is submitted to the President.\n7. ADB reiterates the significance it places upon this report and its implementation, as the\nbasis not merely for CGERP-II, but also for similar future ADB programs or projects.", "63\nAppendix 7, page 1\nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n1. This poverty impact assessment comprises three sections. The first section describes and\nassesses the current social and economic situation in the Kyrgyz Republic, with a specific focus\non the poor and other vulnerable groups. The second section describes the characteristics of and\ntrends in the enterprise sector. The third section discusses the impact on the poor of the policy\nactions under the Corporate Governance and Enterprise Reform Program \u2013 Phase 2.\nA.  Assessment of the Current Social and Economic Situation\n1.  Population and Human Development Indicators\n2. The 1999 census estimated the population in the Kyrgyz Republic at a total of 4.9 million.\nChildren and teenagers comprise 38 percent while the retired (above the age of 60) comprise 9.2\npercent. Sixty-five percent of the population live in rural areas and the rest live in urban areas.\nAverage  life  expectancy  had  not  changed  since  1993,  remaining  at  67  years.  Average  life\nexpectancy was 62.3 years for men and 71 years for women. The maternal mortality rate per\n100,000 live births decreased slightly from 45 in 1993 to 42 in 1999. Average literacy rates for\nmen  and  women  were  98.6  percent  and  96.2  percent,  respectively.  Overall,  the  human\ndevelopment indicators for the Kyrgyz Republic augur well for the future, and the country has\nbeen able to maintain much of its social capital despite years of painful economic transformation.\n2.  Incidence of Poverty\n3. Levels of poverty are high in the Kyrgyz Republic and the trend in the past decade has\nbeen one of increasing poverty. Since independence, per capita gross domestic product has\nfallen, standing currently at approximately $255. The transition started with a prolonged recession\nduring 1992-1995. Some reassuring signs of recovery were seen in 1996 and 1997 as strong,\npositive growth was recorded. Most recently, the Russian financial crisis of 1998 led to a sharp\nincrease in poverty. No data on poverty exists for 2000 or 2001, so it is not clear to what extent\nthe Russian financial crisis has been surmounted.\n4. For 1999, the value of food, or the extreme poverty line, was Som3,849 ($80.7) per person\nper year. This is the amount of resources required to meet the minimum caloric intake. The value\nof the overall poverty line is Som7,340 ($153.9) per annum. Close to two thirds of the population\nconsume less than below this level and, hence, are categorized as poor. Extreme, or food\npoverty,  affected  almost  a  quarter  of  the  population,  and  the  shortfall  in  consumption  was\nsignificant. The gap between the consumption of the poor and the poverty line averaged 25\npercent. Poverty is principally a rural phenomenon with 80 percent of all the poor living in rural\nareas.\n3.  Labor Force Participation and Unemployment\n5. The contraction in the economy in the past decade, particularly in the industry sector, is\nreflected in the significant reduction in the overall labor force participation rates between inter-\ncensal years (1989\u20131999). The rate dropped more significantly in urban areas\u2014from 66.5 to\n42.2 percent\u2014than  in  rural  areas\u2014from  67.3  to  64  percent.  This  can  be  due  to  growth  of\nindividual peasant farming as well as increase in self-employment.\n6. Approximately 37 percent of the total population, or 1.8 million persons, is in the labor\nforce.  Of  these,  1.7  million  are  employed,  while  the  total  number  of  unemployed,  including", "64\nAppendix 7, page 2\nestimates for the unregistered unemployed, is 111,000. Unemployment peaked in 1996 to almost\n8 percent, then dropped to around 6 percent in 1997\u20131999, but increased to 7.5 percent in 2000.\n7. In early 2001, more than 78,000 persons in search of work were registered with the local\nemployment offices of the State Employment Department. Of that number, 58,300 were officially\nunemployed (up from 54,700 on 1 January 2000). Women comprised 53.6 percent; those with\nsecondary  education  or  higher,  89.9  percent;  blue-collar  workers,  49.1  percent;  and  those\nbetween the ages of 16 and 29 years, 39.8 percent.\n4.  Gender\n8. Women in the Kyrgyz Republic are extensively involved in the economic, social, and\ncultural life of the country. Employed women are a little less than 50 percent. The main sectors for\nfemale employment are health, education, culture, communications, and banking and finance,\nwhere they comprise more than half of all employees. On the whole, women\u2019s salaries are lower\nthan those of men, but this is largely explained by the fact that women work predominantly in\nsectors with lower pay. Women represent about 53.6 percent of the officially unemployed in the\ncountry.\n9. The  transition  to  a  market  economy  and  the  resulting  enterprise  restructuring  have\npainfully affected the well-being of women. The network of social support, health care, and child\ncare (kindergarten), often organized through the enterprise, has been significantly reduced, while\nthe functioning of communal and utilities systems has worsened. Many types of services that were\nessentially free of charge have become very expensive and therefore unaffordable to the majority\nof women.\nB.  Employment in the Enterprise Sector\n10. At present of the 228,000 people employed in formal sector occupations, approximately\n112,000, or 50 percent, are working in industrial enterprises. Ninety-five percent of industrial\nenterprises are under private ownership. At the end of 2000, state-owned enterprises (SOEs)\nemploy approximately 10,000 persons, or 8.9 percent of all employment in the industry sector.\nAverage monthly salaries in the industry sector amount to Som2,300 ($48) in 2000.\n11. Enterprise restructuring has been an ongoing phenomenon in the Kyrgyz Republic over\nthe past decade. Nonetheless, the number of officially retrenched persons has remained rather\nsmall, with employers resorting to alternative means to reduce the workforce. While some of the\nenterprises that undergo downsizing due to financial difficulties do adhere to the provisions on\nseverance terms in the Labor Code, employers tend to urge employees to take unpaid leave or\nresign voluntarily and find alternate employment, in order to avoid paying severance payments. In\n1999,  5,381  persons  were  dismissed  from  industrial  enterprises,  while  22,057  were  on\nadministrative leave, and 7,854 were working part-time. In 2000, only 4,387 persons were officially\ndismissed, 28,600 resigned voluntarily, and 22,120 remained on administrative leave.\n12. The difficulties in the enterprise sector in the past decade have led to an expansion of the\nblack (unofficial) economy. Many transactions are undertaken through barter. Small businesses\nand individual entrepreneurs have a significant incentive not to register, while much trade in\nagricultural products is unreported. No accurate data are available on the size of the black\neconomy, but the estimate is that up to 50 percent of GDP may be unrecorded.", "65\nAppendix 7, page 3\n13. Most of the future growth in employment will be from the small and medium-size enterprise\nsector. Out of the total reported vacancies of 2,087 in 2000, only 299 are from the industry\nenterprise sector. At the end of 1999, almost 8,000 small and 1,000 medium-size enterprises were\nregistered with the Ministry of Justice, in addition to 95,000 individual entrepreneurs and 60,000\nenterprises  in  agriculture.  Total  employment  in  the  small  and  medium-size  sector  came  to\n940,000.\nC. Policy Actions with Potential for Significant Action on the Poor\n14. The specific policy actions to be taken under the Program are either pro-poor or poverty-\nneutral. Taken as a whole, the Program can have a positive impact on the economy and society.\nThe Program objectives follow:\n(i)  Provide a sound policy, institutional, and legal environment for good corporate\ngovernance\n(a)  Promote, strengthen, and implement good corporate governance standards\nthrough development of a policy, institutional, and legal framework;\n(b)  Introduce international accounting, auditing, and valuation standards; and\n(c)  Strengthen governance of commercial banks and the legal framework to\nprotect creditors' rights.\n(ii) Launch legal and judicial reforms to improve commercial disputes resolution and\nstreamline judicial processes and procedures.\n(iii) Facilitate  restructuring  of  inefficient  but  viable  enterprises  and  liquidation  of\nnonviable enterprises.\n15. The actions under objective (i) will promote good corporate governance, allow adoption of\na sound legal framework for joint-stock companies (JSCs), develop asset valuation standards,\nharmonize  national  accounting  and  auditing  standards  with  international  standards,  and\nstrengthen corporate governance of commercial banks. The overall net effect of this policy action\non the poor will be positive.\n16. Good corporate governance will improve investor confidence, which in turn will lead to a\ngreater and sustained flow of investments, promoting economic activities and job opportunities.\nAdoption  of  a  well-rounded  legal  framework  for  JSCs  (including  SOEs)  will  ensure  that  the\nshareholders'  rights,  in  particular  those  of  minority  investors,  are  protected.  Adherence  to\ninternational accounting and auditing standards will promote transparency of financial information,\nlimit the opportunities for rent-seeking, and also attract investments in enterprises. Adoption of\nsound banking sector governance practices and sound financial standards will assure depositors\nand borrowers that savings are secure and efficiently intermediated to ensure lower spreads in\ninterest rates. All these direct and indirect effects will benefit the poor as well as the non-poor\n(Table A7.1).", "66\nAppendix 7, page 4\nTable A7.1: Poverty Impact of Objective 1: Formulate a Sound Policy, Institutional, and\nLegal Environment for Good Corporate Governance\nType of Effect\nChannel Direct Effect Indirect Effect Indirect Effect Mitigation\n(Short-Run) (Short-Run) (Medium-Run) Measures\nLabor Good corporate Enhanced transparency Increased economic\ngovernance will improve will lead to greater activity creates demands\ninvestor confidence, investments, which in for goods and services.\nwhich in turn will turn will increase\npromote economic employment.\nactivities.\nPrices Adoption of international Sound banking sector A more transparent and\naccounting and auditing governance will assure accountable enterprise\nstandards will facilitate depositors, including sector will limit the\nfull and clear costing. pensioners a large opportunities for rent-\nmajority of whom are seeking.\npoor, that their savings\nwill be protected, and\nensure that the cost of\nbanking will be low.\nAccess for Increased transparency Greater investments,\nPoor in enterprises (particularly leading to better growth\nin large ones providing prospects, will enhance\nutilities and services to the access of the poor to\nall and the poor) will markets, products, and\nsupport continuation of services.\naffordable services.\nTransfers Reduction of budget\nsubsidies to state-owned\nenterprises will\nfree public resources\nfor investments in\neducation and health and\nother antipoverty\nmeasures.\nCrucial Laws that will provide a conducive environment for sound corporate governance will be adopted and\nAssumptions fully enforced.\nTotal Net Overall positive\nEffect\nNarrative The actions covered under this component will permit the promotion of good corporate governance,\ndevelopment of asset valuation standards, harmonization of national accounting and auditing\nstandards, and improve the disclosure of financial and operational information for  the benefit of all.\n17. The actions covered under objective 2 enhance public, domestic, and foreign investor\nconfidence. An improved investment climate will promote economic activities, which in turn will\ncreate more job opportunities. A strengthened judicial framework will lead to better use of the\nexisting legislation, reduce delays in hearings, and penalize corruption, which will all reduce the\ncost  of  doing  business.  The  overall  net  effect  of  this  policy  action  on  the  poor  is  positive\n(Table A7.2).", "67\nAppendix 7, page 5\nTable A7.2: Poverty Impact of Objective 2: Strengthen the Judicial Framework\n to Support Good Governance\nType of Effect\nChannel Direct Effect Indirect Effect Indirect Effect Mitigation\n(Short-Run) (Short-Run) (Medium-Run) Measures\nLabor Improved judicial Increased economic Increased economic\nframework and introduction activity creates demand activity creates jobs.\nof arbitration will increase for goods and services.\ninvestor confidence, which\nin turn will promote\neconomic activities.\nPrices Improved judicial Reduced\nframework will make corruption will\ncorruption less bring down the\nworthwhile. cost of doing business.\nAccess for While the Program\nPoor supports speedier\nresolution of commercial\ndisputes, the reform\nmeasures to be developed\nunder the Program will\nhave beneficial effects for\nother noncommercial\ncourts as well. For\ninstance, land and other\ndisputes of a civil nature\nwill be resolved faster.\nTransfers\nCrucial Laws and legal decrees required to strengthen the judicial processes and procedures will need to be\nAssumptions adopted and effectively enforced.\nTotal Net Overall positive\nEffect\nNarrative The actions covered under objective 2 will strengthen the judicial processes and procedures and in\nturn enhance public, domestic, and foreign investor confidence and will therefore benefit the poor\nand non-poor alike.\n18. The actions covered under objective 3 will help achieve higher and sustainable economic\ngrowth in the long run. In general, however, enterprise restructuring measures may lead to\ninvoluntary dismissals that will indirectly reduce the purchasing power of the retrenched, and in\nturn reduce the demand for services and products in the short run. However, in the context of the\nKyrgyz Republic, the following facts apply to a large number of weak enterprises, including the\nones  being  targeted  under  this  Program  (i)  significant  losses,  and  tax  and  debtor  arrears;\n(ii) sizable buildup of excess capacity; (iii) lack of any future growth prospects without operational\nor financial restructuring; (iv) large numbers of workers being forced to take administrative leave,\nso that enterprises can avoid paying severence pay; and (v) significant delays in wage payments,\nor in most cases nonpayment or payment-in-kind.\n19. The policy actions proposed in this Program (items F15-F17 or S21 in the policy matrix\n[Appendix 2 to the RRP]) are not likely to have any undue negative impact on employment. The\ncharacteristics outlined in items (i) to (v) in para. 18 apply to all the five enterprises shortlisted in\nF17 of the policy matrix, namely JSC Osh Textiles, JSC Kyrgyz Chemical and Metallurgical Plant,\nJSC Kainda Cable, JSC Oremi, and JSC Crystal. For instance, (i) more than half the labor force\nin JSC Osh Textiles and JSC Kainda Cable (candidates for eventual liquidation) have been on", "68\nAppendix 7, page 6\nadministrative leave; (ii) both companies owe large arrears to the social fund and tax authorities;\n(iii) their capacity utilization levels are, respectively, zero percent (idle) and four percent; and\n(iv) delayed and in-kind payment of wages have been the norm. Similar characteristics hold for\nthe  three  other  shortlisted  enterprises.  Hence,  the  restructuring,  resolution,  or  liquidation\nmeasures will help in rationalizing the sunk investments in these firms, and hence, the policy\nactions will not cause any hardships over and above those being faced by the workers in the\nenterprises at present due to nonpayment or delays.  Moreover, in terms of any adverse impact,\nthe resolution options will be introduced only in a phased manner, in the sense that  liquidation\nwill be pursued only as the last option and only for JSC Osh Textiles and JSC Kainda Cable, if\nthe sale or financial restructuring options fail.\n20. The Government under the Program will have sufficient provisions in the federal budget to\nbe allocated to the Ministry of Labor, for supporting active labor market measures, including\nemployment  counseling,  retraining,  and  public  works  programs  (F19  and  S22  of  the  policy\nmatrix). The State Employment Department within the Ministry of Labor, which is entrusted with\npromoting employment, has estimated that, in the worst case scenario of about 4,200 workers\nbeing retrenched (through liquidation of JSC Osh Textiles and JSC Kainda Cable), such active\nlabor market measures will cost around $250,000. This will meet the need for (i) public works\nprograms for about 1,750 workers at a unit cost of $50; (ii) training for around 500 at a unit cost of\n$40; and (iii) microcredit support through existing rural credit programs, for about 3,600 workers\nat a unit cost of $40.\n21. Overall, restructuring of the selected enterprises in particular and other loss-incurring and\nnonviable enterprises in general will contribute in the medium to long run to improvements in\nefficiency in resource use, rationalize investments and priorities, increase economic growth, and\ngenerate employment opportunities. A direct effect of reduced government expenditures on SOEs\nwill free up revenues for social services and expenditures, including allocations for active labor\nmarket measures. The overall net effect on the poor in the long run is positive (Table A7.3).\nTable A7.3: Poverty Impact of Objective 3: Provide a Conducive Operational and Legal\nEnvironment to Promote Investor Confidence and Support Enterprise Restructuring\nType of Effect\nChannel Direct Effect Indirect Effect Indirect Effect Mitigation\n(Short-Run) (Short-Run) (Medium-Run) Measures\nLabor In the short term, Initial reduction in In the medium term, new Adherence to the\nincreased retrenchment purchasing power among job opportunities will be Labor Code\nof enterprise workers. the retrenched created due to the creation will ensure\nThis, however, is not likelyreduces demand for of new ventures. support through\nto adversely affect the services and products. active\nworkers in the six problem However, as new smaller labor market\nenterprises as a large and medium-size measures.\nmajority of them have enterprises are likely to\nbeen on unpaid leave for emerge, this negative\nlong periods of time.

While there are risks in fully implementing all the complex reform measures, all the specific\npolicy actions are generally pro-poor. These actions can have a positive impact on the overall\neconomy, by enhancing investor confidence and creating a conducive business environment in\nthe Kyrgyz Republic. A strengthened Kyrgyz enterprise sector, supported by a well-functioning\njudiciary, sound banking sector, international accounting and auditing standards, improved asset\nvaluation standards, and reduced government expenditures on nonviable SOEs, will become\nmore resilient in the face of any future shocks that are similar in magnitude to the recent contagion\nstemming from the Russian crisis. This will benefit the whole population at large, poor and non-\npoor alike.", "70 Appendix 8, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO STRENGTHEN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n AND JUDICIAL REFORMS\n1.

Domestic Consultants\n8. One of the main objectives of Part 1 is to enhance institutional capacity to promote and\nimplement good governance norms. The first phase of CGERP established the CDC and the", "74 Appendix 8, page 5\ninstitutional structure for it. TA Loan 1547-KGZ: Capacity Building for Corporate Governance\nand  Insolvency  Procedures  (footnote  1)  supported  the  CDC's  activities.  Over  1997-1999,\naround  14 domestic  consultants  were  trained  in  various  areas  of  corporate  governance,\nmanagement, finance, and marketing by a number of international experts. While a part of this\ngroup have since left, recently the Government took initiatives to strengthen the skills and\nexpertise in the CDC. With this in the background, the Government has committed to utilizing a\nportion of the proceeds under the ongoing TA Loan 1547 to procure advisory support services\nof about 340 person-months domestic consulting needs for corporate governance promotion.3\nThe consultants to be recruited under the TA loan will work closely with the international and\ndomestic consultants to be selected under the proposed TA grant.\n9. In addition, 30 person-months of domestic accountants' inputs are included in part 1 of\nthis TA grant. Significant expertise in this area, stemming from earlier USAID support, can be\nutilized. It is envisaged that about six experts will be recruited to provide the needed services.\nThe TORs for the domestic consultants will mirror those of the international expert, under whose\nsupervision the domestic consultants will work. The TORs for the domestic accounting experts\nwill mirror those of the international expert, who will draft and guide the tasks of the domestic\nexperts.\n10. To support the judicial reform component, six domestic legal experts will be recruited to\nprovide total consulting services of 45 person-months. The domestic legal consultants, together\nwith the international legal and judicial advisor, will be housed at the offices of the JAC. The\nTORs of the domestic legal consultants will mirror those of the legal and judicial adviser, who\nwill draft and guide their tasks.\n11. Overall, 75 person-months of domestic consulting services will be procured under the TA\ngrant.\nB. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent, of which $740,000 will be in foreign\nexchange and $260,000 equivalent will be in local currency. ADB will finance the equivalent of\n$850,000, comprising the entire foreign exchange component and $110,000 equivalent of the\nlocal  currency  component.  The  Government  will  provide  $150,000  equivalent  to  finance\ncounterpart staff, office facilities, and workshops. Table A9 presents the cost estimates and\nfinancing plan. In addition to the total cost of the TA, the Government has undertaken to finance\n(i) domestic consulting support for the CDC; (ii) operational and administrative expenses for the\nCDC; and (iii) the advisory and consulting services for the enterprise restructuring component in\nthe Program, through savings under TA Loan 1547.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n13. The CDC under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office will be the Executing Agency for the TA. As\nper  the  President\u2019s  Disposition  No.281,  dated  5  October  2001,  on  the  Judicial  Advisory\nCommission (JAC), the CDC and the Ministry of Justice shall be providing the counterpart and\nlogistical support for the JAC. The Judicial Reform Monitoring Group (JRMG), in coordination\nwith the JAC, will provide overall supervisory support for the judicial reform component. The TA\nwill be implemented over a period of 15 months from the start date (envisaged in April 2002). It\n                  \n3 The terms of reference for the consulting inputs to be procured under TA Loan 1547-KGZ are in CDC's\naction plan.", "75 Appendix 8, page 6\nis estimated that the TA will require 20.5 person-months of international and 75 person-months\nof  domestic  consulting  support.  All  consultants  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The\nsimplified technical proposal approach will be used for selecting the consulting firm.\n14. All the international consultants will be selected as a team from a single firm. However, if\nthe services of a well-qualified and experienced legal and judicial adviser under part 2 cannot be\nprocured along with those of the other experts under part 1, the legal and judicial adviser will be\nrecruited separately through another firm.\nD.  Reports\n15. The team will submit an inception report within four weeks of the start of the TA, and\nmonthly progress reports, to be prepared by the team leader (or legal and judicial adviser, if this\nexpert is recruited separately) with inputs from the other experts, and a final report at the\ncompletion of the tasks outlined under the TA.  The final report will be followed by a draft final\nreport. The draft final report will be finalized about 3 weeks after it is submitted to ADB and the\nGovernment for comments.\nTable A9: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($)\nItem Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.
