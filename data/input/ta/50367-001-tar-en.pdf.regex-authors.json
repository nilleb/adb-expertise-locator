INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the efficient and timely \nsharing of knowledge solutions for development challenges among member countries of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Knowledge solutions will be sourced from ADB\u2019s technical knowledge, \nfrom  ADB  member  countries\u2019  own  experiences,  and  from  the  application  of  high-level \ntechnologies.1 Knowledge solutions will be shared using a \u201cdigital first\u201d approach that makes it \neasy to prepare, find, and use short-form knowledge content.2 Real-time communication across \nADB and member countries will be supported by online expert communities. TA implementation \nwill also focus on building the skills of developing member country (DMC) counterparts to capture \nand share their experiences and insights through Development Asia.3 \n \n2.  The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 identified knowledge solutions as a strategic priority, \nand reaffirmed ADB\u2019s commitment to promoting innovative solutions and services in DMCs.4 This \nTA is included in the 2017 work plan of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s DMCs face an increasingly complex set of challenges arising from demographic \nchanges, rapid urbanization, widening income gaps, and climate change. These and other \nchallenges demand knowledge solutions that draw upon different disciplines. At the same time, \nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are becoming guiding principles for the allocation of \npublic resources and implementation of policy measures. Shaping solutions in local contexts, \nespecially to localize the SDGs, requires practical ways to exchange knowledge solutions, share \npolicy experiences, develop skills to design better interventions, and provide access to information \nand experts who can help DMCs formulate localized solutions.  \n \n4.  In his Vision Statement for the New Term (1 July 2016), President Nakao stated that \u201cour \nclients need knowledge inputs, based on ADB\u2019s cross-country experiences. It is critical that the \nsector and thematic groups, under the leadership of their Technical Advisors, promote knowledge \nwork, provide expertise and ideas to operational departments, and strengthen partnerships with \ncenters of excellence around the world.\u201d6 In August 2016, participants in the Roadmap for \nKnowledge Management Workshop and the Country Directors Forum reinforced this message by \nhighlighting governments\u2019 need for just-in-time knowledge responses to requests for advice and \ninformation. An independent evaluation of how ADB engages with middle-income countries \nconcluded that ADB should pay closer attention to the knowledge needs of its growing middle-\nincome country clientele and derive value from two-way knowledge transfers carried out by these \ncountries.7 The President\u2019s Planning Directions for 2017 stress that ADB\u2019s \u201cknowledge solutions \n                                                \n1  ADB (Office of the President). 2016.

ADB\u2019s knowledge outputs, as well as the knowledge derived from its operations and \npartnerships, are not consistently accessible to users. The Top Task Survey conducted on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite in 2015 revealed that DMC users are interested in lessons and good practices from \nproject implementation; policy and technical advice from ADB; case studies; accessing raw data \nand datasets from projects; collaborating, sharing knowledge, and networking with peers and ADB \nexperts; and e-learning and training opportunities.9 Survey respondents also indicated that it \ntakes too long to access content from the ADB website, that content can be difficult to find, and \nthat users generally prefer short-form technical content. These findings suggest that the current \ncuration  of  ADB  content  makes  it  difficult  to  find  and  use  knowledge.  Development  Asia \ncomplements the role of ADB\u2019s website by sharing knowledge solutions for DMC development \nchallenges in a digital first format. Such solutions are drawn from a variety of sources within ADB \nand from ADB members.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: DMCs\u2019 ability to address their development \nchallenges  through  knowledge-based  solutions  improved.10 The  TA  will  have  the  following \noutcome: DMCs\u2019 access to knowledge solutions from ADB, other ADB members, and knowledge \npartners improved.11  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities   \n \n7.      The proposed TA has three outputs: (i) enriching the Development Asia website by \nsubstantially expanding its content; (ii) encouraging more active and practical approaches to \nknowledge exchange among ADB (including Sector and Thematic Groups or STGs), DMCs, and \ndevelopment partners; and (iii) building the capacity of DMC officials to use a common platform \nto share their knowledge with ADB and their peers. \n \n8.         Output 1: Development Asia\u2019s website enriched. Through Knowledge for Solutions - \nKnowledge Portal (Subproject 3) and South-South Knowledge Sharing Program (Subproject 2), \nthe web-based platform called Development Asia, which was developed to promote country-to-\ncountry knowledge sharing and disseminate ADB\u2019s knowledge solutions faster and more easily, \nwent live in the third quarter of 2016 and was officially launched on 4 July 2017.12 Six easy-to-\n                                                \n8  ADB (Office of the President). 2017. Planning Directions for 2017 and Preparation of Work Program and Budget \nFramework, 2018\u20132020. Memorandum. 27 February (internal).  \n9  Top task is a survey method that identifies and ranks the tasks that stakeholders are trying to perform through a \nwebpage. \n10 As defined by the project. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 ADB.  2014.  Technical  Assistance  for  Knowledge  for  Solutions  \u2013  Knowledge  Portal. Manila  (TA  8833-REG \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/48242-005/main#project-pds). This TA project developed and launched a \u201cproof-of-\nconcept\u201d web-based knowledge portal site initially known as K-Portal but later named Development Asia. The site \nsought to collect and share short-form, digital-first knowledge solutions for the easier use and faster dissemination \nof knowledge relevant to DMC development. ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Knowledge for Solutions - South\u2013\nSouth Knowledge Sharing Program. Manila (TA 8831-REG https://www.adb.org/projects/48242-004/main#project-\npds). This TA project supported pilot knowledge-sharing activities to identify structural gaps in the systematic \npromotion of country-to-country knowledge sharing. Pilot activities under this TA pointed to the structural difficulty of \n ", "  3 \nproduce and easy-to-read formats were developed (Supplementary Appendix 1). The platform \nhas more than 100 pieces of content curated from knowledge products, reports, interviews, and \nevents delivered by STGs, the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, \nregional departments, and external content partners. Modern approaches to collaboration through \nonline  communities  were  also  researched  and  piloted  through  Knowledge  for  Solutions  - \nKnowledge Portal (Subproject 3). Three focus group discussions with selected DMC officials from \nthe Philippines were used to guide content preparation. \n \n9.      Although the Development Asia website is growing, it requires more content to be a dynamic \nand rich source for learning about best practices and the practical application of high-level \ntechnologies. It must also support online collaboration among experts and peers beyond ADB to \nhelp DMCs develop knowledge solutions suitable for their contexts. The TA will enrich the \nwebsite\u2019s content by repurposing existing knowledge solutions from (i) selected ADB knowledge \nproducts and services; (ii) the experiences of countries in Asia and the Pacific, as well as other \nregions; and (iii) experience gained from the use of innovative or advanced technologies in ADB\u2019s \nmember  countries,  where  a  digital  first  approach  would  increase  the  findability  of  curated \nknowledge solutions. Content from country knowledge plans could also be disseminated through \nDevelopment Asia. Lessons from ADB\u2019s website and other websites are reflected in the evolution \nof Development Asia as a modern knowledge and collaboration solution. The TA will also support \nthe consolidation of content from websites created under ADB TA projects and left static after the \nexpiration of these projects.  \n \n10.      Output 2: Online communities in Development Asia created and actively engaged. \nThe  TA  will  also  support  the  creation  of  online  expert  communities  operating  through \nDevelopment Asia. Staff from STGs, operations departments, and other ADB departments can \ninteract actively with their counterparts in governments, research institutions, universities, private \nmanufacturers of high-level technology, and other knowledge organizations on development \nissues facing DMCs. In addition to existing online communities accessible through Development \nAsia (e.g., those concerned with education, governance, and internal audit), the TA will develop \ncommunities for climate change, gender, health, and social development, among others. \n \n11.      Output 3: Training on capturing and sharing knowledge and experiences provided.  \nThe TA will pool insights and good practices from countries by building the skills of DMC partners, \nexecuting and implementing agencies, and knowledge partners to capture and share their \nexperiences and insights and encourage them to share their products through Development Asia. \nThe capacity of DMC partners, executing and implementing agencies, and knowledge partners to \ncapture and share knowledge will be strengthened further through webinar training and e-learning, \nface-to-face sessions linked to ADB events, and various other learning initiatives. The TA will \nimprove access to SDG-related content relevant to DMCs, create better links between technical \nexperts from ADB and DMC-based organizations, and share innovative solutions and applications \nof high-level technology to development challenges. In doing so, the TA will provide DMCs with \naccess to insights and analysis that will help them craft their own approaches to solving economic, \nenvironmental, and social problems in their contexts and in collaboration with partners.  \n \n \n \n                                                \nsupporting (i) knowledge-sharing activities beyond ADB\u2019s member countries, (ii) the sharing of knowledge regarding \nthe application of high-level technologies with DMCs, and (iii) addressing DMCs\u2019 knowledge needs in a just-in-time \nmanner.  \n ", "4 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n12.     The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $250,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) and $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by \nADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n13.   ADB will administer the proposed TA through the Knowledge Sharing and Services Center \n(KSSC) of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department. The KSSC will work \nin close collaboration with ADB operations departments (including resident missions), knowledge \ndepartments,  STGs,  external  knowledge  partners,  and  selected  government  agencies  and \norganizations (e.g., academics and think tanks) in ADB member countries to generate content for \nDevelopment Asia.13 The KSSC will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants, and organize \nand provide resource persons for training sessions. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in the following table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  September 2017 \u2013 November 2020 \nExecuting agency  ADB through the KSSC \nImplementing agencies  The KSSC in collaboration with ADB operations departments (including \nresident missions), sector and thematic groups, external knowledge \npartners, and selected government agencies and organizations. \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by the KSSC \nInternational  43 person-months  $492,500 \nconsultants (individual \nconsultant recruitment)  \n \nNational consultants  99 person-months  $358,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nDisbursement involves using external financing before the TASF. \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, KSSC = Knowledge Sharing and Services Center, TA = technical assistance, TASF \n= Technical Assistance Special Fund. \nSource: ADB. \n \n14.       The KSSC will work with STGs and the operations departments, in identifying materials \nto be developed as digital first, based on the operational know-how and use of innovative and \nhigh-level technologies that are part of their annual work programs. Using recommendations from \nSTGs  and  operations  departments,  the  KSSC  will  identify  and  collaborate  with  potential \nknowledge partners who can share their content through Development Asia while promoting \ncountry-to-country knowledge sharing. High-level technology application cases will be showcased \nin close consultation with sector and thematic groups. \n \n15.      The KSSC will prioritize the curation of content with resident missions that have larger \npipelines and greater opportunities to apply high-level technology at scale.  To identify content \nfrom projects, a survey of key executing and implementing agencies will be carried out to ensure \n                                                \n13 ADB will obtain a no-objection in writing from the relevant DMC before conducting or financing any TA activities within \nthe DMC\u2019s territory. \n ", "  5 \nthat initiatives under this TA address their knowledge need priorities meaningfully. Partnerships \nwill be built with research institutions and other organizations to develop content for the site.  \n \n16.  The KSSC, in consultation with STGs, the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation \nDepartment, the Department of External Relations, and the operations departments, will develop \na plan to convert existing content into curated digital content for Development Asia. Special \nattention will be given to content aligning with DMC needs identified in country partnership \nstrategies and country knowledge plans. The short-content form will make it easier for materials \nto be translated into DMC languages for wider dissemination.  \n \n17.      Consulting services. Through individual consultant selection, the KSSC will engage \nexperts to draft a digital first strategy, manage client relations, and test the usability of the site, as \nwell as to design, encode, and facilitate online communities under output-based, lump-sum \ncontracts with a provision for fixed out-of-pocket expenditures. The KSSC will also engage part-\ntime technical writers under the supervision of a senior editor to support the STGs on content \naudit, writing, and editing for Development Asia. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance \nwith the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).14  \n \n18.      Social media and websites.  The Planning Directions for 2017 and Work Program and \nBudget Framework for 2018\u20132020 strongly emphasize the mainstreaming of knowledge solutions. \nIn light of this support, it is expected that Development Asia will be sustained by KSSC staff time \nusing ADB\u2019s administrative budget after the TA is closed. Development Asia will tap content from \nboth ADB and non-ADB sources. To finance content development, the KSSC will also draw from \nthe TA resources of other departments and content produced by knowledge partners. A content \npartnership already exists with Brink Asia, and several other organizations have expressed \ninterest in content partnerships and exchanges with no financial implications. A communication \nplan  has  been  prepared  to  promote  Development  Asia  among  target  audiences,  including \ntechnical specialists and development practitioners in DMCs.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, and \n(ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis for \nSharing Development Knowledge Solutions in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board.  \n                                                \n14 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \n   \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \n \nDMCs\u2019 ability to address their development challenges through knowledge-based solutions improveda \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks  \nOutcome       \nDMCs\u2019 access to  a.
