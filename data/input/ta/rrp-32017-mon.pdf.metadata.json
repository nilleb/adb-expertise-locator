It will be the first major step toward\nachieving  the  longer  term  objective  of  establishing  a\nsustainable market-based housing finance system that will\nallow low and middle income households access to housing\nloans  from  qualified  participating  banks.  For  the  poorest\nfamilies, the Project will support subprojects such as housing\naction area plan (HAAP) schemes to improve low-income\nhouseholds\u2019 housing, income-earning potential, and access\nto basic infrastructure and services.\nClassification Poverty: Other\nThematic: Human Development\nEnvironmental Category B\nAssessment The  environmental  implications  of  the  HAAP  subprojects\nwere reviewed. Most of the impacts will be beneficial, and\nadverse  impacts  will  be  mitigated.  Initial  environmental\nexaminations have been undertaken for two representative\nsubprojects.\nRationale Over  the  past  three  decades,  Mongolia  has  experienced\nrapid  urbanization.  Presently,  over  half  of  the  population\nresides  in  urban  areas.  However,  since  the  end  of  the\nsocialist era, very little new housing has been built, resulting\nin a critical shortage of adequate housing in Mongolia and a\nrapid increase in unserviced ger housing areas surrounding\nthe cities. The access of the poor to urban services and\nadequate housing continues to be limited. One of the critical\nfactors to increase access to good housing and services, for\nthe poor and for middle-income families, is housing finance,\nwhich  is  not  available  in  Mongolia.  By  establishing  and\npartially  funding  a  sustainable  housing  finance  system  in\nMongolia, the proposed Project is the logical next step in\ndeveloping  the  housing  sector  after  Mongolia  has\npromulgated the National Housing Strategy, Housing Law,\nHousing Privatization Law, and the Condominium Law with\nassistance  from  earlier  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\ntechnical assistance (TAs).\nThe lack of long-term finance and past inadequacy of legal\nframework  for  property  rights  has  kept  Mongolian\ncommercial  banks  from  engaging  in  lending  for  housing.\nCurrently, the major sources of housing finance for low- and\nmiddle-income households are their own savings and family\nassets. The access to a housing finance loan acts as a\ncatalyst in releasing the financial and technical resources of\nfamily,  friends,  and  relatives.  When  surveyed  regarding", "iii\nhousing finance, most potential beneficiaries indicated their\nwillingness to contribute at least as much as the loan to the\nconstruction or purchase of the house. Further, the results\nindicate  the  overwhelming  demand  to  improve  housing,\nmainly by buying or constructing new houses.\nADB\u2019s involvement in housing in Mongolia is justified by (i) a\nlarge demand for adequate housing and shelter, which is\nessential for survival of the households, particularly for the\npoor, given the extremes of the Mongolian climate; (ii) the\nsignificant health benefits that will accrue from better and\nimproved  basic  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  the  interlinkages\nbetween  the  financial,  banking,  housing  and  construction\nsectors  that  will  be  strengthened,  and  substantial\nemployment opportunities that will be created.\nObjectives and Scope The main objectives of the Project are to (i) help to meet the\nimmediate shortage for adequate housing in Mongolia; (ii)\ncontribute  to  the  longer-term  objective  of  establishing  a\nsustainable, market-based system for the delivery of housing\nfinance to meet the borrowing needs of low- and middle-\nincome households; (iii) reduce poverty in ger housing areas\nby providing and upgrading basic infrastructure and services\nthrough the HAAP schemes; and (iv) improve the quality of\nlife of low-and middle-income urban households through the\nprovision of affordable housing loans.\nThe  proposed  Project  consists  of  three  parts:  Part  A,\nlending  to  low-  and  middle-income  households  through\nparticipating commercial banks and intermediaries; Part B,\naddressing poverty reduction by financing HAAP schemes in\nger  housing  areas;  and  Part  C,  capacity  building  and\nestablishing effective project management.\nCost Estimates The Project is estimated to cost $24 million equivalent, of\nwhich $5.5 million is the foreign exchange cost and $18.5\nmillion equivalent is the local currency cost.\nFinancing Plan                                                                                ($ million)\nSource           Foreign          Local         Total          Percent\n                      Exchange      Currency    Cost\nADB                   5.5                9.5            15.0                63\nPCBs                  0.0               3.3              3.3                14\nBeneficiaries      0.0                4.7              4.7                20\nGovernment       0.0                1.0              1.0                  3\n     Total             5.5              18.5            24.0              100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PCBs = participating commercial banks.", "iv\nLoan Amount and The  proposed  ADB  loan  is  for  11.817  million  Special\nTerms Drawing  Rights  ($15  million  equivalent)  from  its  Special\nFunds resources. The loan will have a maturity of 32 years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years.

The ADB loan totaling $15 million equivalent will\nresult  in  housing  investments  of  about  $24  million\nequivalent,  by  leveraging  financial  contributions  from\nparticipating  commercial  banks  and  the  funds  of  the\nbeneficiaries. The Project will increase the capacity of the\nparticipating  commercial  banks  and  other  financial\nintermediaries to respond to the housing finance needs of", "v\nthe  low-  and  middle-income  households.  The  Project  will\nbenefit about 25,000 low- and middle-income households or\nabout 125,000 people.\nThe Project will enhance human development in Mongolia\nby increasing the availability of housing finance for low- and\nmiddle-income  households.  In  addition,  the  Project  will\ngenerate  significant  construction-related  employment\nopportunities  (estimated  at  32,000  person  years).

I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to Mongolia for the Housing Finance (Sector) Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In mid-1997, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government embarked on\ndeveloping  a  sound  legal  and  policy  framework  for  the  housing  sector  in  Mongolia.  ADB\nprovided a small-scale technical assistance (TA)1 to help prepare the Housing Law (HL) and the\nNational  Housing  Strategy  (NHS)  and  to  recommend  market-oriented  amendments  to  the\nHousing Privatization Law (HPVTL) and the Condominium Law. The HL sets out housing sector\nobjectives that will be pursued by the Government including (i) creating conditions whereby\ncitizens  can  provide  themselves  with  adequate  housing  that  meets  health  and  safety\nrequirements; (ii) implementing housing and associated infrastructure development policy based\non  basic  market  requirements;  (iii)  encouraging  the  involvement  and  increasing  the\nresponsibilities of the private sector in the planning, construction, maintenance, and repair of\nhousing  and  residential  infrastructure;  and  (iv) developing  the  ger  housing  areas2  into\ncomfortable housing areas. In April 1999, the Mongolian Parliament approved the HL, NHS,\nCondominium Law, and HPVTL. ADB\u2019s follow-on TA3 was approved in 1998 to (i) help develop\nthe institutional and methodological capacity to implement the NHS within the context of a new\nand amended legislation; and (ii) establish the framework for an improved financing system for\nhousing. Substantial progress has been made under this, including (i) establishing condominium\nassociations; (ii) restructuring the housing companies in Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan, Erdenet, and\nZuunmod including a review of their legal, financial, and operational framework; (iii) initiating\nfour pilot housing area action plans (HAAPs) for new housing and existing ger housing areas,\nwhich promotes the bottom-up process of planning; and (iv) assessing the viability of a housing\ndevelopment fund (HDF) that has been provided for in the HL.\n3. During the ADB Programming Mission in March 1999, the Government requested for\nTA4 to prepare a feasibility study for the first Housing Finance (Sector) Project in Mongolia\ntargeting low- and middle-income households. Following completion of feasibility studies, the\nLoan Fact-Finding Mission was fielded in November 2000 and loan appraisal from 20 March to\n7 April 2001.5 This report is based on the consultant\u2019s studies; a field visit; and discussions with\nrepresentatives of (i) national, provincial, and district government agencies; (ii) participating\ncommercial banks; (iii) participating communities; (iv) low-income beneficiaries; (v) private and\npubic enterprises; (vi) financial intermediaries; and (vii) external funding agencies. The Project is\nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  and  sector  strategy  and  the  poverty  partnership  agreement\nsigned with the Government in March 2000, under which a key target is to reduce the proportion\nof  Mongolian  people  living  below  the  poverty  line  by  at  least  half  by  2005.

Sector Description\n1. Urban Development\n4.    Mongolia has urbanized rapidly in the last three decades. Major rural-to-urban migration\nstarted during the 1970s, when heavy investments in cities began with financial assistance from\nRussia. The urban population grew 4.5 percent in the 1970s, 3.6 percent in the 1980s, and 2.1\npercent in the 1990s. While Ulaanbaatar has been growing fast, the populations of smaller\nurban centers have been decreasing as their economic bases have weakened and some ger\nhouseholds have moved back to the countryside.\n5.    About 59 percent of Mongolia\u2019s 2.5 million population is classified as urban; more than\nhalf of the urban population is in the capital, Ulaanbaatar. Three other cities were elevated to\nthe administrative status of a province in May 1994, bringing the total number of provinces to\n21. These are Choir, Darkhan, and Erdenet, which have a combined population of 180,000. The\nnext  levels  of  settlements  in  the  hierarchy  are  the  18  provincial  capitals  with  an  average\npopulation of 28,000. In addition, about 330 rural districts with an average population of about\n2,000,  provide  services  to  the  rural  and  nomadic  populations.  About  35  settlements  are\nconsidered urban, with an average population estimated at 4,000. Each rural district is further\ndivided into smaller administrative units, usually 4 to 6 subdistricts, each consisting of 70 to 120\nfamilies.\n6.    Mongolian  cities  present  two  very  distinct  types  of  development.  The  first  involves\nplanned areas featuring prefabricated or brick apartment blocks from 1 to 10 stories, surrounded\nby  vaguely  defined  open  spaces.  The  second  involves  \u201ctemporary\u201d  ger  housing  areas\ncharacterized by long strips of large unserviced plots with wide roads on either side, which now\ndominates urban growth. The HL recognizes that most new urban development will be guided\nby  market  considerations  and  implemented  by  individual  initiatives,  rather  than  by  the\nconstruction  of  subsidized  apartments  in  formally  planned  areas.  While  interest  has  been\ngrowing for community action planning to improve ger housing areas, the approach has yet to\nbe formally adopted. The proposed Project will promote the bottom-up HAAP approach to\nplanning based on extensive consultations with the communities and resulting in new planning\nprocedures and standards for residential development.\n2. Housing Situation\n7.    Mongolia\u2019s recent transition to a market economy is focusing attention on the country\u2019s\nhousing delivery system in urban areas. Until the early 1990s, the norm for new housing\nprovision was public sector construction of prefabricated apartment buildings. With the collapse\nof the construction industry and the virtual end of public sector housing supply, the incremental\nimprovement of housing in ger housing areas, beginning with the traditional ger and ending with\na substantial all-weather house, will need to become the predominant path to affordable housing\nfor low-income households. Also, while over 90 percent of the housing has been privatized, the\nhousing condition is seriously deteriorating because of inadequate financing for maintenance.\n8.    While  there  are  no  official  estimates  of  housing  demand  in  the  country,  the  total\ncessation of public housing construction coupled with high migration has led to a rapid growth in\nger housing areas over the past several years, especially in Ulaanbaatar. Also, while officially\nonly one household should be occupying each apartment, often more than one household is\nsharing  an  apartment.  Much  ground  floor  housing  has  been  converted  into  cafes,  bars,", "3\nrestaurants, shops, and offices. Such conversions have reduced by about 15 percent of the\napartment housing in Ulaanbaatar. Housing demand is also manifested in the number of new\nger housing area plots being issued by the district offices of Ulaanbaatar municipality. Ger\nhousing  areas  and  the  doubling  up  in  apartments  have  absorbed  most  of  the  population\nincrease from 1992 to 1998. Based on the population growth and existing land use patterns, ger\nhousing  areas  in  Ulaanbaatar  increased  by  more  than  2000  hectares  during  1999.  The\ndevelopment of the housing sector plays a crucial role in the transition to a market-based\nhousing and land system, and in development of urban areas. Accordingly, the Government has\ntaken steps to establish the policy and legal framework for creation of a market-based shelter\nand urban services sector.\n3. Housing and Land Markets\n9.    Housing markets are developing with the trade in apartments and the start of trading in\nger  plots.6  Privatized  apartments  and  future  ger  plots  are  potential  sources  of  equity  for\ntransactions in property. Progress in the development of land markets is slow and will remain so\nuntil land is privatized. However, once private ownership is introduced, ger residents will benefit\nfrom the security brought about by land registration and title to their land, as well as its asset\nvalue.  A  major  step  forward  has  been  the  enactment  of  the  Cadastral  Survey  and  Land\nRegistration Law in 1999 and the approval of the Cadastral Survey and Land Registration\nProject.7 Apart from providing the basis for securing title, the law can help form the basis for a\nmuch-needed  property-based  taxation  system.  Local  governments  also  have  an  invaluable\nresource,  publicly  owned  land,  which  can  benefit  households,  businesses,  and  community\ngroups by providing for the rational transfer of land to private use, retaining certain areas for\ncommunity use and supporting the development of a sustainable land market.\n4. Housing Finance\n10.    Despite the housing policy framework, a number of issues will effect the development of\na sustainable housing finance system in Mongolia. The first overriding issue is the complete lack\nof experience with housing finance in the country. In the past, Government entities constructed\nall formal housing, and most rural families lived in self-financed gers. While some banks and\nnonbank finance institutions have made small apartment repair and renovation loans, there has\nbeen no term or mortgage lending for housing in Mongolia.\n11.    Second, the lack of mortgage lending is complicated by the lack of clarity in the laws\nrelating to land ownership. For example, the Civil Code currently prohibits the use of land lease\ncertificates as collateral. However, a proposed new draft of the Land Law is to be considered by\nparliament in their October to December 2001 session.8 A third major issue is the state of\ndevelopment  of  the  banking  system.9  Despite  recent  progress,  the  banking  system  is  still\nrelatively fragile and feeling the effects of the 1996 banking crisis. Although the supporting\nfinancial infrastructure is now largely in place, many of the banks in the system are new, small,\nor do not consistently qualify according to the prudential regulations of the Bank of Mongolia\n(BOM). Term lending beyond one year is rare, with loans to individuals based on large savings\n                  \n6  Most of the households in the ger housing areas either have or know about land allocation documents issued by\nthe city governments, which are mostly leases of 40-60 years.\n7  Loan 1736-MON: Cadastral Survey and Land Registration Project, for $9.9 million equivalent, approved in\nDecember 1999. The loan agreement has been signed and loan effectivity is expected shortly.\n8 The proposed new Land Law would allow, (i) the use of land lease certificates as collateral, (ii) transfer of leases\nthrough inheritance, and (iii) the transfer of land lease certificates to another person.\n9 A major restructuring of the Mongolian financial system was undertaken in December 1996 to (i) eliminate\ninsolvency in the banking system; and (ii) restore confidence and halt disintermediation that had resulted from\nnonperforming loans, inadequate management, and weak supervision.", "4\naccounts. In addition, savings deposits, usually the main source of lending, dropped from 43\npercent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1991 to 31 percent of GDP in 1996, largely as a\nresult of low confidence following the banking crisis.\n12.    Although the banking sector is still small and recovering from the 1996 crisis, there have\nbeen significant improvements over the past four years. Systemic risk has dissipated and\nnonperforming loans in the Mongolian banking system have fallen from 61 percent to 31 percent\nin  two  years.  Further,  the  significant  increase  in  capital  requirements  has  had  a  major\nstrengthening impact on the financial strength of the banks. Previous bank failures have forced\nthe weak banks to close, and BOM's supervisory role has been substantially reinforced. Several\nbanks in the sector have met or exceeded BOM\u2019s prudential norms for the past three years and\nhave expressed the desire to initiate housing finance operations. Under its Financial Sector\nAdjustment Credit,10 the World Bank is focusing on banking sector reforms in Mongolia in\nconjunction with ADB\u2019s Second Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPII).11 In 1999, as a mark of\nits increasing confidence in the Mongolian banking sector, the World Bank approved a private\nsector development credit project (PSDC)12 using banks to provide loans to small- and medium-\nsized enterprises.\n13.    In  1997,  Parliament  deleted  the  pricing  provision  before  passing  the  Apartment\nPrivatization Act. For a nominal registration fee, tenants obtained titles to their apartments from\nthe Government. Apartment units are now sold on the open market, creating an emerging\nresidential property market. However, since land is still owned by the state, ger housing area\nresidents only have certificates of occupancy from the local government. These cannot be used\nas collateral for housing improvement or construction loans. In addition, although ger housing\narea upgrading is a priority intervention in the HL, the institutional arrangements for upgrading\nremain undefined and local government agencies have limited capacity for project planning,\nfinancing,  and  implementation.  To  assist  in  financing  housing  activities,  the  creation  of  a\nnational HDF is provided for in the HL. According to the law, HDF capital can be used for\nfinancing (i) renovation, upgrading, and construction of infrastructure for condominiums and\nprivate houses; (ii) loans to individual and legal entities allocated for such purposes; and (iii)\nother expenditure stated in law.\n5. Institutional Framework for Housing\n \n14.    The institutional base for the housing sector is the Department for Coordination and\nPolicy Implementation of Construction and Urban Development in the Ministry of Infrastructure\n(MOI).  Implementation  of  Government  housing  and  infrastructure  policies  should  also  be\nimproved  by  the  amalgamation  of  the  Construction  and  Architecture  Agency  with  the\nGovernment  Implementing  Agency  for  Urban  Services,  the  latter  concerned  with  the\nmanagement and maintenance of infrastructure as well as housing and condominium matters.\nEach level of local government has some involvement in the housing and services sector\nfunctions in planning, architecture, and service provision. Local government will become more\ninvolved as a result of the transfer of state assets to local governments, including those of the\nhousing and communal services sector. Housing maintenance is also a responsibility of the\nrecently created public utility and service organizations in most provincial13 centers. The public\nsector  was  traditionally  responsible  for  the  management  and  maintenance  of  apartment\nbuildings and communal services, as well as billing and collection on behalf of utility companies.\n                  \n10World Bank, Financial Sector Adjustment Credit, for $32 million equivalent, approved in April 2000.\n11Loan 1743-MON: Second Financial Sector Program, for $15 million equivalent, approved on 22 June 2000. The\nloan agreement has been signed and loan effectivity is expected shortly.\n12World Bank, Private Sector Development Credit, for $12 million equivalent, approved in May 1999.\n13The Province (aimag), is the largest administrative unit in Mongolia.", "5\nThis  role  has  now  been  reduced,  as  most  maintenance  and  repair  functions  have  been\ntransferred to condominium associations and residents. An underlying theme in the institutional\nframework is decentralization of state power to lower levels of government. The process is\nongoing and can be judged generally successful so far.\n6.  Existing Legal Framework\n15.    Sustainable housing finance markets are based on the collateral value of the property\nbeing financed; and the collateral value is influenced by the ability of the lender to efficiently\ntake  possession  and  dispose  of  the  property.  The  existing  legal  framework  allows  for\ncondominiums, houses, and other immovable property to be used as collateral for loans. The\napproval by parliament of an amendment to the Civil Code on 2 February 2001,14 authorizes\nbanks to seize the collateralized house or apartment if the borrower fails to repay the loan,\nwithout having to go through cumbersome court proceedings.  Also Article 120.1 of the Civil\nCode states that owners of a residential house are entitled to possess, use, and dispose of the\nproperty at their discretion and Article 75.3 states that owners may transfer to others their rights\nto  possess,  use,  or  dispose  of  these  properties.  Further,  two  ADB  programs  contain\ncomponents to strengthen the legal framework underlying collateralized lending. Under the\nFSPII  a  TA15  is  included  to  identify  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  deficiencies  and\nconstraints to using immovable property as collateral. Also, the recently approved Cadastral\nSurvey and Land Registration Project includes TA16 for a land legislation expert to make a\ncomprehensive overview of existing relevant legislation. When undertaking these reviews, the\nprojects must include basic issues related to the proposed Project such as (i) consideration of\nconcerned  appropriate  eviction  laws,17  and  (ii)  appropriate  review  of  the  Registration  of\nImmovable Property Law to ensure the legal basis for incremental construction lending.\n7.  Urban Poverty\n16.    Although poverty was not officially acknowledged prior to 1990, the rapid change from a\ncentrally-planned  economy  to  a  market-based  system  resulted  in  a  significant  increase  in\npoverty. Due to high inflation (325 percent in 1993 and 66 percent in 1994), wages lost most of\ntheir  value,  and  the  closure  or  privatization  of  state  enterprises  led  to  widespread\nunemployment. According to the 1998 living standards measurement survey (LSMS), about 36\npercent of the population were poor, living below a weighted national poverty line of $18 per\nperson per month.18 People living in urban areas (38 percent) are marginally poorer than those\nliving in rural areas (33 percent). Nearly half of the people in provincial capitals are poor, 40\npercent of households headed by women are poor, and 58 percent of the unemployed are poor.\nThe depth of urban poverty is severe and the poor have limited access to adequate housing and\nurban services including sanitation and safe drinking water.\n                  \n14Specifically, this is clause 6, article 368 of the Civil Code, which states that banks and nonbanking organizations\nare entitled to possess, use, and dispose of the properties provided as collateral for the loan from the day the loan\nagreement is terminated, if the contract provides for transfer of collateral to banks, if a borrower breaches the\nconditions of the loan agreement.\n15 TA 3459-MON: Strengthening Financial Sector Development, for $600,000, approved on 22 June 2000.\n16 TA 3395-MON: Capacity Building for Cadastral Survey Land Registration, for $990,000, approved on 27 January\n2000 along with Loan 1736-MON.\n17 Eviction is currently prohibited between 1 October and 30 April (winter).\n18 Data is from a survey for measuring standards of living in mid-1995 undertaken with the assistance of the World\nBank. The poverty line is intended to represent a minimum standard of living that enables people to satisfy their\nbasic needs measured by a basket of expenditure items. The director of the National Statistics Office issued an\nupdated set of poverty lines by region on 18 January 2001.  For Ulaanbaatar, it was MNT19,300 or $18 per person\nper month.", "6\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n17.    In addition to the NHS, HL, Condominium Law, and HPVTL, in the past three years\nGovernment  has  passed  the  Registration  of  Immovable  Property  Law,  the  Geodesy  and\nCartography Law, the Land Fee Payment Law, and the Cadastral Survey and Land Registration\nLaw. Together, these laws form the basis for developing new approaches to housing need and\nhousing finance.\n18.    Under the NHS, housing policies are now to be demand driven, with standards and\nregulations geared to adequate and affordable housing provided by individuals and enterprises.\nThe NHS is designed to: (i) transfer the financial burden of housing to the private sector; (ii)\nimprove the quality of existing stock; (iii) establish a land registration and valuation system; and\n(iv) assist vulnerable groups. The NHS marks a new relationship between Government and the\nprivate  sector  with  the  Government  playing  an  enabling  role,  guiding  and  regulating  the\ndevelopment of the housing market and supporting the private sector provision of housing.\n19.    HAAPs now form a key component of Government housing policy. HAAPs are ger area\nupgrading and urban expansion projects (i) based on the initiatives of local communities and\ngovernments (ii) reflect local environmental and socioeconomic conditions, and (iii) focus on\nsites where housing and infrastructure improvements are clearly required. The goal is to provide\nsufficient plots to serve all levels of housing affordability and to derive as much revenue as\npossible in exchange for individual rights to develop the plots. Pilot projects designed for HAAPs\nin Darkhan, Zuunmod and Ulaanbaatar under TA 3090 (footnote 3) are the first examples of the\napproach. Aided by Government\u2019s policy initiatives, housing markets are now beginning to\ndevelop in urban areas. This is evidenced by the construction and sale of private apartments,\ntrade in ger plots, and the rapid growth of condominium associations. Housing privatization\nrepresents a future strength underlying the housing market, since apartment owners have a\nmajor asset when they wish to buy another property.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n20.    The  focus  of  external  assistance  in  urban  development  has  been  on  basic  urban\nservices  with  the  main  sources  of  assistance  coming  from  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  Japan\nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) (Appendix 2). Under the Provincial Towns Basic Urban\nServices Project,19 ADB has supported improved water supply, sanitation, solid waste systems,\nand bath houses in five western provincial capitals. A complementary TA20 addresses capacity\nbuilding and management accounting in public utility and service organizations to enable them\nto become more effective producers of sustainable urban services. Under the Ulaanbaatar\nUrban Services Improvement Project, the World Bank is providing a loan and Australian Agency\nfor International Development (AusAID) a TA grant, to improve urban services in ger housing\nareas in Ulaanbaatar, including construction of access and service roads, drainage systems,\nsolid waste collection infrastructure, and community buildings. The TA component under the\nproject is designed to provide the capital\u2019s water and sanitation authority with a comprehensive\nfinancial management, reporting, and operating system. JICA has also supported the capital\u2019s\ndevelopment by rehabilitating water supply facilities in Ulaanbaatar City.\n21.    ADB has also been a leading funder in the financial sector. The first Financial Sector\nProgram  (FSP)  loan21  and  two  TAs22  were  designed  to  establish  a  legal  and  regulatory\n                  \n19 Loan1560-MON, Provincial Towns Basic Urban Services Project, for $6.8 million equivalent, approved in 1997.\n20 TA 2881-MON, Capacity Building for the Provision of Urban Services in Provincial Towns, for $825,000, approved\nin August 1997.\n21Loan 1509-MON: Financial Sector Program Loan, for $35 million equivalent, approved December 1996.", "7\nframework for the financial sector; restructure the banking system to strengthen viable banks\nand close insolvent ones; reduce the Government\u2019s involvement in the sector while encouraging\nmarket orientation and commercialization; and develop capacities to improve bank credit and\nrisk and asset-liability management systems. In support of the Government\u2019s Financial Sector\nReform Program, ADB approved the FSPII to promote the development of a competitive, stable,\nand  broad-based  financial  system.  Under  the  FSPII,  financial  intermediation  will  be\nstrengthened,  domestic  and  international  resource  mobilization  enhanced,  and  sustainable\neconomic growth supported. In the area of poverty reduction, ADB has provided TA to support\nthe National Poverty Alleviation Program  and has undertaken four loans in the social sector\nover the past eight years.23\nD. Lessons Learned\n22.    ADB\u2019s  Mongolian  portfolio  is  performing  satisfactorily  despite  the  current  fiscal\nconstraints  and  general  institutional  weaknesses.  Project  implementation  is  generally\nproceeding on schedule. However, policy and institutional support in all sectors continues to be\nrequired. All of ADB\u2019s projects include substantial capacity building to address policy and sector\nreforms, to strengthen institutional and staff capabilities. This has been instrumental to the\nsuccess of ADB\u2019s Mongolian portfolio. The Government\u2019s commitment and project ownership\nhas also been crucial.\n23.    Lessons from ADB\u2019s Employment Generation Project24 include the need (i) to undertake\ndetailed assessment of participating commercial banks (PCBs); (ii) for reasonable interest rates\nto subborrowers to ensure adequate repayment performance; (iii) for reasonable subloan sizes;\nand (iv) to revise and implement detailed credit guidelines and financial analyses, to improve\nloan utilization rates and loan quality. The Project will (i) specify minimum lending targets for\nfinancing the HAAP schemes to reach the low-income households; (ii) stipulate in the loan and\nsubloan  agreements  the  specific  use  of  loan  reflows  for  the  low-  and  middle-income\nhouseholds; (iii) consider mature savings and credit cooperatives that would like to borrow for\nhousing as demand increases; and (iv) incorporate in the HAAP schemes various qualifying\ncriteria including public-private partnerships and community participation in Project design and\nimplementation.\n24.    The proposed Project will be ADB\u2019s first intervention in the housing sector in Mongolia.\nThe lessons learned from previous projects in Mongolia, and from experience with similar urban\nprojects elsewhere, have been incorporated into the project design. The local and the central\ngovernments  shows  strong  ownership  of  the  Project;  the  government  has  guaranteed\navailability of counterpart funds; and a comprehensive training and institutional development\nprogram  is  included  in  the  Project.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  has  also  been\nestablished ahead of project implementation.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n25.    In March 2000, ADB endorsed a new country operational strategy (COS), which makes\npoverty reduction the top priority for future ADB operations in Mongolia. The poverty partnership\n   \n22 TA 2720-MON: Strengthening the Supervisory and Restructuring Capacity of the Bank of Mongolia, for $1 million,\napproved December 1996; and Loan 1510-MON: Upgrading Skills and Systems of Commercial Banks, for $3\nmillion, approved December 1996.\n23 A fifth project, Loan 1836/1837-MON: Social Security Sector Development Program, for $12 million equivalent, and\nassociated TA No. 3709-MON: Strengthening Policy for Social Security Reform, for $600,000 equivalent, were\napproved on 28 August 2001.\n24 Loan 1290-MON: Employment Generation Project, for $3 million equivalent, approved in December 1993.", "8\nagreement  identifies  specific  targets  for  poverty  reduction  and  establishes  mechanisms  to\nmonitor performance. The new strategy is built on lessons learned during the 1994-1999 period\nand  is  designed  to  achieve  poverty  reduction  through  pro-poor  interventions  that  create\nemployment and foster economic growth.  The strategy will foster economic growth and combat\npoverty by switching the main mechanism for growth generation from public sector investments\nin infrastructure to employment-generating investments, which engage the private sector. The\nstrategy  will  also  support  mechanisms  to  improve  governance,  thereby  increasing  the\nproductivity of the economy. To be effective in reducing poverty, the strategy will (i) generate\nemployment on a wide basis in the short-to-medium term, (ii) generate income and employment\nmainly  in  urban  areas,  (iii)  rely  on  the  private  sector  to  deliver  the  needed  employment\nopportunities, (iv) provide a one-time intervention to establish a strong social safety net for the\nvery poor, and (v) continue activities aimed at maintaining social service delivery to avoid new\nforms of poverty at a later stage.\n26.    The strategy identifies five core sectors: the financial sector, agriculture, the public\nsector,  the  social  sector,  and  urban  development.  By  improving  living  standards  and  the\nproductivity  of  low-income  households  in  urban  areas,  the  proposed  Project  meets  the\nobjectives  of  the  new  COS  for  Mongolia.  Also,  under  the  proposed  Project,  there  are\ninterlinkages between the housing sector, financial sector, and (through construction activities)\nthe generation of employment, which is consistent with the new COS.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n27.    ADB, through its lending and TA program, has been engaged in policy dialogue with the\nGovernment on a wide range of issues in the housing and financial sectors. ADB has had\nconsiderable  success  supporting  the  development  of  housing  policy  in  Mongolia  including\npromulgation of the concerned laws. The existing situation and policy reform measures to be\nlinked to the Project (as agreed with the Government) are presented in a time-bound action plan\nin Appendix 3, the Policy and Institutional Action Plan. The plan incorporates action that focuses\non establishing a conducive environment for housing development, establishing appropriate and\nsustainable mechanisms for housing finance, and strengthening institutional capacities in the\nhousing  finance  and  contracting  sectors.  The  agenda  for  policy  dialogue  has  covered  (i)\nimplementing the housing sector policy, (ii) developing ger housing areas into viable housing\ndistricts,  (iii)  developing  a  sustainable  housing  finance  system,  (iv)  formulating  laws  and\nregulations for mortgage finance, and (v) improving governance.\n1. Implement Principal Housing Sector Policy Objectives\n28.    While ADB has achieved considerable success in supporting the establishment of a\nnational  housing  policy  and  pursuing  policy  dialogue  in  the  housing  sector,  several  policy\nobjectives have yet to be fulfilled. The proposed Project and the related policy and institutional\nreform measures will enable significant additional progress in achieving overall policy objectives\nin the housing sector. The comprehensive set of surveys in preparation for the Project have\nestablished a significant database on which effective projects and programs for low- and middle-\nincome households can be designed and implemented. To capitalize on this data base, MOI\nand the National Statistics Office must use the data to set out and achieve policy objectives, and\nensure that baseline data are continually updated as urbanization and the resultant demands for\nhousing and urban services increase. The present situation where district administrations allot\nparcels of land and control land use without recourse to planning has led to haphazard and\nuncontrolled urban growth in which the future installation of infrastructure will be extremely\ndifficult. To support the formulation and implementation of housing and associated infrastructure\ndevelopment policy based on market requirements, Ulaanbaatar City, where the majority of", "9\ngrowth is occurring, has agreed to finalize and adopt an urban development strategy based on\ncentralized land use controls by November 2001.  Fully aware of the need for a common\napproach, the city\u2019s various planning agencies are now beginning to coordinate their efforts.\n2. Develop Ger Housing Areas into Viable Urban Housing Districts\n29.    As ger housing areas account for nearly half the urban housing including the largest\nproportion of urban poor, the development of these areas into \u201ccomfortable\u201d housing areas is a\npriority of the national housing policy. Local governments have approached these districts as\n\u201ctemporary\u201d housing areas whose residents can be relocated to the fringes of the city in order to\nfollow out-dated master plans that promote the construction of apartment blocks. The HAAP\napproach to improving ger housing area infrastructure and services which was first introduced\nby ADB TA 2890 (footnote 1) and detailed in the follow-on TA 3090 (footnote 3), is the only\nalternative to the outdated master plans. During the advisory TA and subsequent preparation for\nthe proposed Project, two of the target cities, Darkhan and Zuunmod, confirmed that they will\nimplement their HAAP pilot projects and formally adopt the HAAP approach at the city council\nlevel. Accordingly, the Project is in a unique position to replicate the HAAP approach to ger\nhousing area development in other cities, and especially in Ulaanbaatar. Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan,\nZuunmod, and other provincial centers have agreed to develop efficient techniques for ger area\nplanning based on the HAAP approach to be incorporated into their local master plans by June\n2002.\n3. Develop a Sustainable Housing Finance System Based on Local Banks\n30.    The achievement of the principal objective of the proposed Project depends primarily on\nthe state of the country\u2019s banking sector. As a result of ADB\u2019s first Financial Sector Program\n(FSP) loan  and related TA as well as the World Bank\u2019s Financial Sector Adjustment Credit, the\nfinancial  sector  has  been  significantly  strengthened  over  the  past  few  years.  Further,  a\ncomprehensive  strategy  for  banking  reform  has  been  adopted  in  collaboration  with  ADB,\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and the United States Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAid). In conjunction with the two FSP loans and World Bank projects, ADB is\nin a singular position to influence the development of the banking sector by implementing the\nproposed Project. To qualify and continue to participate in the Project, PCBs will be reviewed\nquarterly to ensure that they are in compliance with BOM\u2019s prudential norms, especially those\nrelating to nonperforming loans and loan concentration ratios. In addition, to decrease the\npercentage of state ownership in the sector, the Government has decided to proceed with\nprivatizing the Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia (TDBM) with assistance from ADB\nand World Bank. To attain the Project objective of serving low- and middle-income households,\nPCBs have agreed to formulate, before loan effectiveness, housing loan application forms and\nloan underwriting and servicing procedures that will ensure that Project loans will be made\nsolely to low- and middle-income families.\n4. Clarify Regulations for Mortgage Finance and Efficient Use of Collateral\n31.    FSPII is taking the lead in strengthening and expanding the loan collateral system in\nMongolia. In conjunction and close coordination with the implementation of FSPII25 and the\nCadastral Survey and Land Registration Project, the proposed Project can have a significant\nimpact on establishing the legal framework necessary for the efficient functioning of a housing\n                  \n25FSPII includes a condition that requires BOM and the Government to prepare a plan on types of property that can\nbe used as loan collateral. This will include plans for related amendments to the Land Law and the Civil Code. The\nTA associated with FSPII will identify relevant amendments by October 2001.", "10\nfinance  system.  The  most  significant  constraint  is  the  current  inability  to  register  and  use\nproperty as collateral for a loan because all land is owned by the state.  Under the proposed\nrevised Land Law, which is expected to be enacted by Parliament in 2001, a holder of a long-\nterm land lease (15 to 60 years with the possibility of a 40 year extension) would be able to\nregister and use such a leasehold as loan collateral.  Since the new proposed Land Law is\nimportant for promoting a sustainable housing finance system in Mongolia, its enactment has\nbeen made a condition for subloan disbursements to individuals, expected to commence from\nyear three onwards. As covenanted, at least 20 percent of the ADB loan proceeds will be\nreserved for direct lending to individuals. The ability to enforce the security interest by a creditor\nfollowing default by the borrower is also critical.  In this regard, the recent amendment to the\nCivil Code has provided appropriate powers for creditors to enforce loan collection by taking\npossession of loan collateral. Review of the Registration of Immovable Property and Secured\nTransactions Law is required to ensure the legal basis for incremental construction lending, a\ntechnique often used by low-income households to build housing as the availability of funds and\nmaterials permit.\n5.  Improve Governance\n32.    By facilitating homeownership for an increasing number of Mongolian households, the\nProject will give them a stake in better government at the local and national levels. As property\nowners, project beneficiaries will become local taxpayers and will take a greater interest in the\nperformance of local government in the provision of services and the level of tariffs and other\ncharges for those services. Homeowners will become more aware of city planning issues such\nas master plans and zoning regulations and the need for enforcement. Uncontrolled growth of\ncities such as Ulaanbaatar will affect their property values and quality of life if rights of way are\nnot respected, journeys to and from work become more chaotic, infrastructure is not maintained,\nand  water  and  air  pollution  increases.  In  general,  by  pressure  of  the  citizenry  for  better\ngovernment,  the  Project  will  (i)  contribute  to  developing  the  institutional  capacity  of  the\nGovernment to implement the new HL and other laws; (ii) result in improved management and\nmaintenance  of  common  areas  and  apartments  through  capacity  building  of  condominium\nassociations; (iii) develop demand-driven housing programs to be adopted by local governments\nresulting in stronger ownership of housing and urban development plans at the local level,\ngreater transparency, and more efficient monitoring of the plans and programs; and (iv) promote\nreforms in the functions of housing companies and the providers of basic utilities, to streamline\ntheir operations and strengthen management and internal control systems.\nIV.   THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n33.    Over the past three decades, Mongolia has experienced rapid urbanization. Presently,\nover half of the population resides in urban areas. However, since the end of the socialist era, in\nwhich all housing was constructed by government entities, very little new formal or apartment\nhousing has been built. Consequently, ger housing areas that are not provided with urban\nservices surround Mongolian cities, have expanded rapidly, and now comprise about 50 percent\nof the housing in most urban areas. Hence, access of the poor to urban services and adequate\nhousing continues to be limited. One of the critical factors in increased access to adequate\nhousing and services for the low- and middle-income families is housing finance, which is\npractically nonexistent in the country. By establishing and partly funding a sustainable housing\nfinance system in Mongolia, the proposed Project is the logical next step in the development of\nthe housing sector after ADB\u2019s successful policy making TA 2890 (footnote 1) and institutional\nstrengthening TA 3090 (footnote 3).", "11\n34.    The lack of long-term finance, inadequate legal framework with respect to property\nrights, and weak institutional capacity has kept Mongolian commercial banks from lending for\nhousing. Currently, the major sources of housing finance for all but high-income households is\ntheir own savings and family assets. International experience shows that once low- and middle-\nincome families obtain sufficient income, their highest priority becomes improving their housing\nsituation. The results of primary surveys for the Project indicate an overwhelming demand for\nimproved housing. Much of the demand is for a completed house, which can be built in the short\nconstruction season in Mongolia. Once households have access to housing finance, the loan\ncatalyzes releasing the financial and technical resources of family, friends, and relatives.\n35.    ADB\u2019s involvement in the housing sector in Mongolia is justified because (i) of large\ndemand for adequate housing and shelter, which is essential for survival of the household,\nparticularly for the poor, given the extremes of the Mongolian climate; (ii) significant health\nbenefits will accrue from better and improved basic infrastructure; (iii) investment in the housing\nsector can be designed to achieve full cost recovery to ensure sustainability; and (iv) linkages\nwill be strengthened between the financial, banking, housing, and construction sectors, and\nsubstantial employment will be created in construction.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n36.    The main objectives of the Project are to (i) help to meet the immediate need for\nadequate housing in Mongolia; (ii) contribute to the longer term objective of establishing a\nsustainable, market-based system for the delivery of housing finance to meet the borrowing\nneeds of low- and middle-income households; (iii) reduce poverty in ger housing areas by\nproviding and upgrading basic infrastructure and services through HAAP schemes; and (iv)\nimprove the quality of life of low- and middle-income urban households by providing affordable\nhousing loans.\n37.    The proposed Project consists of three parts: A \u2013 lending to low- and middle-income\nhouseholds through PCBs and intermediaries; B \u2013 addressing poverty reduction by financing\nHAAP schemes in ger housing areas and providing serviced plots for new housing; and C \u2013\ncapacity  building  and  establishing  effective  project  management.  About  60  percent  of  the\nlending under A is expected to be through intermediaries, including private-public enterprises.\nBased on survey results, the enterprises plan to construct apartment blocks near their plant\nsites for employees currently living in ger housing areas, most of whom fall in the low income\nbracket.26\n1. Part  A:  Lending  through  Participating  Commercial  Banks  and\nIntermediaries\n38.    The proposed Project is unique because it is the first loan of its kind to Mongolia, and will\nbe the initial funding source for the country\u2019s Housing Development Fund (HDF).27 The legal\nbasis for the HDF is contained in the HL.28 Given the near total lack of housing finance in the\n                  \n26 Based on consultations with the National Statistics Office (i) low income is defined as households earning monthly\nincomes of $73-182 (MNT80,000-200,000) per month; and (ii) middle-income, from $183-910 (MNT201,000-\n1,000,000)  per month.\n27 A Government working group of officials from Ministry of Finance and Economy, Ministry of Infrastructure, BOM,\nand PCBs are finalizing the HDF regulations.\n28Chapter 4, Articles 10-13 of the HL stipulate the responsibilities and sources of funds for the HDF which according\nto the HL will be administered by the \u201cState Central Administrative Organization responsible for housing\u201d, i.e.,\nMinistry of Infrastructure.", "12\ncountry,  lending  through  banks,  which  are  the  only  institutions  with  experience  in  loan\norigination and recovery, is the best mechanism for building a sustainable housing finance\nsystem. Establishment of a revolving fund lending at market rates and the commitment by PCBs\nto lend their own money are the main assurances of project sustainability.\n39.    Lending through intermediaries such as private-public enterprises greatly reduces the\nrisk of loan repayment to PCBs.29 Further, lending through intermediaries is the best way to\nrespond to the immediate need for housing in Mongolia while working in an imperfect market. In\naddition, given the extensive demand for housing loans, lending to thousands of individuals for\nnew  house  construction  or  improvements  will  greatly  overburden  the  loan  departments  of\nparticipating banks. The problem of efficiently managing thousands of small loans for differing\nend uses can be resolved by lending through intermediaries. These entities, which know the\nhousing situation and financial capacities of their employees better than most banks, are an\neffective means of responding to the varying housing finance needs of low- and middle-income\ngroups.\n40.    Thus, under part A of the Project, PCBs will onlend to intermediaries including mainly\nprivate and public enterprises for onlending to their employees in the low- and middle-income\nbracket. Detailed interviews were conducted at 12 representative private-public enterprises. The\nenterprises had a high employee demand for housing loans and indicated that the availability of\nsuch loans would enhance employee morale resulting in higher productivity and profitability. To\nprevent any negative impact on the financial position of the enterprises, the subsidiary loan\nagreement will require that borrowings from PCBs cannot exceed 30 percent of an enterprise\u2019s\ntotal equity. The enterprises have also confirmed that only the registered certificates of the\nhouses  and  apartments  to  be  built  or  bought  with  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  pledged  as\ncollateral, and not the enterprises\u2019 productive assets. Further, the title to the apartment or house\nwill be transferred to the employee only upon full repayment of the loan on a hire purchase\nagreement basis. The Project will also promote savings mobilization. The PCBs are currently\nworking out the details for introducing housing savings accounts for subborrowers, who after\nreaching a certain amount of savings, could then qualify for a loan under the proposed Project.\n41.    The second category of subborrowers will be small- and medium-scale contractors,\nwhich will borrow construction loans from PCBs. A third category under part A, which will not\nentail onlending to individual borrowers, will be condominium associations, which will borrow for\napartment  block  maintenance  and  major  repairs.  Lending  to  condominium  associations  is\nprovided for in the HL and is a specified purpose of the HDF. Using the combined apartment\ntitles of condominium association members as collateral, the condominium associations have\nexpressed  a  desire  to  access  the  HDF  by  borrowing  from  PCBs  for  these  purposes.\nAccordingly, lending to condominium associations for apartment block improvement has been\nprovided for in the latter years of the Project.  Direct lending to individuals is envisaged from\nyear  three  onwards,  subject  to  sufficient  development  of  the  PCBs\u2019  housing  finance\ndepartments, including their ability to assess the repayment capacity of prospective borrowers.\n2. Part B: Poverty Reduction through HAAP Schemes\n42.    The basic purpose of the HAAP subprojects is to distribute available capital resources\nfor housing and infrastructure in ways that (i) allow low- and middle-income households access\nto a minimum level of housing and urban services, (ii) allow HAAP schemes to be replicated in\nways that respond to the housing and urban development needs of the cities, (iii) support long-\nterm  urban  and  land  development  objectives,  and  (iv)  generate  construction-related\n                  \n29 Cost recovery for loans to enterprises will be through deductions from the salaries of the employee borrowers.", "13\nemployment  in  the  selected  communities  to  benefit  the  poor  and  unemployed.30  HAAP\nupgrading activities will be the Project\u2019s principal means of reducing poverty and improving the\nquality of life of poor urban households. HAAPs represent a bottom-up city and community-\ndriven approach to urban planning that has already been formally adopted in Darkhan and\nZuunmod.\n43.    Four types of HAAP schemes will be eligible for financing: (i) new HAAPs that focus on\nthe basic layout of roads and power utility lines at new housing sites to facilitate urban planning\nand lower the cost of providing infrastructure in the future; (ii) \u201cin-fill\u201d HAAPs31 that include the\nmore efficient use of existing infrastructure to provide fully serviced plots that can be auctioned\nto builders of private sector housing; (iii) simple upgrading HAAPs that include relatively small\nimprovements to ger housing areas to initiate a process of incremental, community-based\nimprovement in these areas; and (iv) complex upgrading HAAPs that include more extensive\nphysical and economic improvements to larger ger housing areas. In-fill and upgrading HAAPs\nwill be implemented together to provide affordable serviced plots for new housing construction\nthat may be funded under part A.\n44.    A total of 18 HAAP schemes are to be implemented under the Project in the cities of\nDarkhan,  Zuunmod,  and  Ulaanbaatar,  benefiting  about  7,000  households.  Under  TA  3090\n(footnote  3),  HAAP  pilot  projects  were  designed  for  the  three  concerned  cities.  These\nsubprojects will be included in the first HAAP applications under the proposed loan. The two\nadvanced pilot projects in Darkhan and Zuunmod include both in-fill and ger housing area\nupgrading components. The in-fill project in Darkhan will provide about 200 serviced plots of\ndifferent sizes that will be affordable to low- and middle-income households. The complex\nupgrading  project  will  include  seven  water  supply  kiosks,  road  grading  and  improvement,\nfootpaths, drainage control, and street lighting for more than 850 families living adjacent to the\ncity center. Water supply will involve piped water to existing and new kiosks with the pipes sized\nto allow for individual metered connections along the way. The pilot project in Zuunmod is\nsmaller in scope, involving, (i) 127 serviced, in-fill plots32 in the city center, and (ii) the provision\nof piped water to kiosks, and drainage and road grading in a small ger housing area of 200\nfamilies. While the pilot projects in Ulaanbaatar remain to be finalized, they are also likely to\ninclude both in-fill and ger upgrading activities.\n45.    The newness of the HAAP approach and limited capacity of Mongolian cities to engage\ncapital investments will generally keep the size of the first in-fill HAAPs to less than 300 plots\nper scheme. Nevertheless, considerable pent-up demand for serviced plots exists even in\nZuunmod, where more than a thousand households have applied for one of the 117 infill plots.\nThese in-fill plots will be auctioned to the highest bidders to recover the cost of infrastructure\nand generate surplus funds that can be used to finance additional trunk line infrastructure or ger\nupgrading.  Darkhan  has  similarly  agreed  to  auction  its  infill  sites.  City  governments  will\ncontribute 25 percent of the cost of the in-fill projects.\n46.    Recent  studies  have  shown  that  urban  poverty  in  Mongolia  is  largely  a  matter  of\nhousehold income. Efforts to reduce poverty must therefore be combined with an effective labor\nintensive strategy that is largely focused on generating private sector employment. Accordingly,\nHAAP  subprojects  will  generate  a  range  of  activities  for  employment  of  local  unemployed\nworkers with construction experience. In particular, ger housing area upgrading will directly\nreduce unemployment in subproject neighborhoods and eliminate many of the visible poverty\n                  \n30 About 32,000 person-years of construction-related employment will be generated during project implementation.\n31Such HAAPs will be undertaken on vacant land and will be fully serviced and connected to existing trunkline\ninfrastructure for electricity, roads, water supply, sewerage, and solid waste systems.\n32Each plot is 200m2.", "14\nconditions related to poor water supply, drainage, and solid waste collection. Ger housing area\nupgrading will also be based on a community decision-making and governance approach that\nfocuses subproject design and implementation on both immediate and sustainable means to\nreduce poverty.\n47.    Both  in-fill  and  upgrading  HAAPs  will  have  a  strong  multiplier  effect  on  the  local\nconstruction sector and employment. Better access to basic infrastructure and services will\nencourage the development of home- and community-based employment that will increase\nhousehold and community incomes. More dependable and less expensive water supply will\nencourage the development of home gardens that will help improve health conditions and\nreduce  recurrent  water  expenditures  for  all  neighborhood  households,  especially  the  poor.\nImproved infrastructure and facilities will lead to greater pride in the neighborhood, demand for\nbetter  education,  more  home-based  work,  and  improved  productivity.  More  reliable\ninfrastructure  and  services,  improved  neighborhood  conditions,  and  secure  tenure  will\nencourage households to upgrade their housing and obtain an improved standard of living.\n3.  Part C: Capacity Building and Establishing Effective Project Management\na. Project Implementation Assistance\n48.    Project  implementation  assistance  includes  (i)  consulting  services  for  project\nmanagement, procurement, disbursement, and project performance management systems; (ii)\ntechnical, economic, financial, legal, and management advice; (iii) on-the-job training to improve\nthe skills of the PMU staff; and (iv) necessary equipment to support the PMU. The institutional\narrangements for project implementation are in Appendix 4.\nb.  Capacity Building\n49.    Government has agreed that the capacity building component will be financed under the\nloan.  This  component  will  comprise  significant  institutional  strengthening  required  for  the\nestablishment and operation of the PMU, the proper functioning of the PCBs and lending\nintermediaries, and the design and implementation of HAAP schemes.  The main areas of\ncapacity building include training for (i) mortgage-based lending in PCBs, (ii) general credit\noperations of PCBs, (iii) mobilization of long-term resources appropriate to Mongolia, (iv) local\ngovernment officials and communities with particular focus on households headed by women in\ndeveloping HAAP infill and upgrading schemes, and (v) small- and medium-scale contractors.\nThere  will  also  be  a  continued  focus  on  (i)  developing  the  institutional  capacity  of  the\nGovernment to implement the HL and related laws; (ii) building capability of local governments\nto formulate demand-driven housing programs that will result in stronger ownership of housing\nand urban development plans, greater transparency, and more efficient monitoring of the plans\nand programs; and (iii) community mobilization for HAAP schemes.\n4.  Linkage Between Parts A and B of the Project\n50.    The most apparent linkage between parts A and B will be the provision of serviced sites\nfor the construction and improvement of housing financed by loans through part A. Virtually no\nprovisions were made for private individual housing under the previous centralized planning and\nstate run approach to housing and urban development. Master plans produced in the early\n1980s  focused  almost  exclusively  on  the  construction  of  large-scale,  multistory  apartment\nblocks by state-owned companies. Most of these master plans have expired and efforts are\nunder way to develop new ones. The new master plans will place considerable emphasis on the\nconstruction of individual, private sector housing based on the Government\u2019s housing policy.", "15\n51.    The HAAP approach, directly supported by part B of the Project, will provide an effective\nmeans to introduce new planning procedures and standards for residential development. The\nHousing Law enables HAAPs to become integral components of city master plans and to\nsupercede previous planning requirements in areas where they are applied. The application of\nnew HAAP sites in rapidly growing Ulaanbaatar will enable the city to begin to control its rapid\ngrowth and to provide more secure land tenure for low income housing construction in areas\nwhere trunk infrastructure is not yet in place. HAAP in-fill sites will also provide fully serviced\nplots for households seeking to build private sector housing, including those obtaining a loan\nunder part A. The new master plans for several cities will be linked to the provision of residential\ninfrastructure and to the upgrading of existing neighborhoods. Part B is the first broad-based\nattempt to address these concerns in cities of all sizes and to establish a new, market-based\nworking arrangement between city planning and private-public investment. Experience gained\nthrough the implementation of the Project and the financing of HAAPs will help Mongolian cities\nto plan their development in a more effective manner.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n52.    The Project cost is estimated at $24 million equivalent, comprising $5.5 million in foreign\nexchange cost and $18.5 million equivalent in local currency cost. The cost estimates are\nsummarized in Table 1 and the detailed costs are in Appendix 5.\nD. Financing Plan\n53.    It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of 11.817 million Special Drawing Rights ($15\nmillion equivalent) from its Special Funds resources representing 63 percent of the total project\ncost. The loan will have a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. Interest will\nbe charged at 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter. The borrower will be Mongolia.  The loan will finance the entire foreign exchange\ncost  of  $  5.5  million  and  $9.5  million  (51  percent)  equivalent  of  local  currency  cost.  The\nprovision for financing local currency costs is considered justified under ADB\u2019s local currency\nfinancing policy.33 Because of its low per capita income, Mongolia is classified as a least\ndeveloped country under the United Nations system, and such ADB member countries are\ngiven priority in ADB\u2019s local currency financing policy. Of the proposed ADB loan of $15 million,\npart A, lending through PCBs, is estimated to absorb about $10.0 million equivalent; and part B,\nwhich is composed of HAAP subprojects, is estimated at $3.5 million equivalent. Part C related\nto  project  management  and  capacity  building  is  estimated  at  $1.5  million  equivalent.  The\nbalance  of  the  project  cost  will  be  borne  by  the  PCBs,  beneficiary  households,  and  the\nGovernment from their own resources in cash and in kind contributions.\nE.  Implementation Arrangements\n1. Organization and Management\n54.    The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project is the Ministry of Finance and Economy\n(MOFE), which will also bear the foreign exchange risk under the Project. The MOI will act as\nthe  Implementing  Agency  for  the  technical  aspects  of  the  Project.  A  PMU34  has  been\nestablished in MOI and is headed by a full-time project manager. The PMU will be responsible\nfor the overall coordination and implementation of the Project. This will include liaison with ADB\n                  \n33R1-95: Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditures on Projects, 3 January 1995.\n34During project implementation the PMU functions will evolve into a secretariat for the HDF and upon completion of\nthe Project the HDF will graduate into becoming an independent housing finance institution.", "16\nand the principal stakeholders; monitoring of the flow of funds; and the selection, engagement,\nand management of consultants. The PMU will be the clearing house for loan disbursement\nrequests and approvals from the PCBs and local governments. A solid financial management\nsystem including internal financial and accounting controls of the PMU will be established before\nthe first disbursement under the project. The organization chart for project implementation is in\nAppendix 6. A project steering committee composed of officials from MOFE, MOI, BOM, and the\nconcerned local governments has been formed for high-level policy guidance and coordination.\nThe PSC is chaired by the State Secretary MOFE and will meet at least once every three\nmonths.\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nComponents Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Part A: Lending through Participating Commercial Banks and\nIntermediaries\n55.    The  eligibility  criteria  for  PCBs  and  relending  and  onlending  mechanisms  are  in\nAppendix 7. Following approval and selection of a PCB, MOFE, on behalf of the Borrower, will\nenter into a subsidiary loan agreement (SLA)35 with the PCB. The SLAs will be subject to\nagreement by ADB on a no-objection basis, and will cover among other things the terms and\nconditions of the subsidiary loan. Under part A, in the absence of an adequate benchmark, and\nto avoid disturbing the domestic interest rate structure, the interest for loans from MOFE to\nPCBs will be determined based on (i) the cost of funds for MOFE (estimated at 10.0 percent per\nannum), and (ii) the marginal cost of funds for PCBs (estimated at 14.4 percent per annum).\nThe cost of funds for MOFE will include the loan rate from the Asian Development Fund, and a\nmark-up for MOFE administrative costs, foreign exchange and interest rate risk, and inflation.\nThe difference between cost of funds for MOFE and the marginal cost of funds for the PCBs will\naccrue to a special HDF account at BOM.36 Subsidiary loans will be denominated in domestic\ncurrency (togrog) and the interest rate to the final borrower will be market determined. The\nrelending and onlending rates will be subject to review by MOFE and the project steering\ncommittee at six-monthly intervals. Funds will be disbursed to PCBs from a project account at\nBOM. The PCBs will onlend to intermediaries and individual borrowers at their marginal cost of\nfunds plus a spread to cover their loan processing expenses, adequate loan provisions, and a\nreasonable margin.37 The lending intermediaries will not take any mark-ups for loan processing\nexpenses, since access to housing loans for employees and/or members will strengthen the\nenterprises.\n56.    For part A, funds will be relent to the PCBs from the project operation account on a\nback-to-back basis. This means that the PCBs will repay the project operation account on\nessentially the same terms and loan repayment schedule as those of the underlying subloan. By\nonlending on a back-to-back basis, the Project  will effectively create a revolving fund for the\ncontinuous  provision  of  housing  finance  to  the  PCBs.  To  allow  for  delayed  repayment  by\nsubborrowers, a grace period of six months will be allowed for repayments from PCBs to the\nproject account. Lending intermediaries will submit detailed loan packages to the PCBs for\nfinancing.  During  the  first  year  of  project  implementation,  the  first  five  loan  packages,  or\nsubloans, will be submitted to the PMU and ADB for review and approval to ensure that the final\nborrowers meet project lending criteria as defined in the SLAs. The PMU will carry out these\nreviews expeditiously to avoid delays in project implementation. After the first year of the\nProject, only sub-loans greater than an amount to be mutually agreed upon by the Borrower and\nADB will be submitted to ADB for approval. Based on continued successful implementation of\nthe Project, this threshold will be increased annually.\n57.    To ensure that loans under the Project are made solely to low- and middle-income\nfamilies, parameters for lending to low- and middle-income groups will be developed and agreed\nto by MOFE, PCBs, and lending intermediaries. To ensure that an adequate number of loans\nand loan amounts are made to low-income families, at least 25 percent of the part A loan\nproceeds relent under part A will have to be onlent to low-income families. This minimum\nlending targets will be included in the SLAs and onlending agreements and monitored by the\nPMU.  Lending  criteria  for  the  various  income  groups  will  be  based  on  household  income\n                  \n35Sample SLAs for the project implementation were prepared during loan appraisal and these are expected to be\nfinalized by October 2001.\n36Retention of a 4.4 percent interest spread in the HDF will result in the accumulation of an estimated $2 million by\n2005. The additional funds, which could be used for relending to PCBs, will strengthen the sustainability of the\nHDF.\n37A preliminary estimate of market interest rates to final borrowers is about 19 percent per annum.", "18\ncertified  by  the  PCBs  and  lending  intermediaries,  and  up-dated  annually  by  the  PMU  in\ncollaboration with MOFE, MOI, and the National Statistics Office. For the first two years, PCBs\nwill provide bulk loans to private and public enterprises for onlending to their employees and to\nmedium- and small-scale contractors who have adequate collateral. Direct lending to individuals\nand other intermediaries is envisaged to start in the third year as the mortgage lending capacity\nof PCBs is increased as a result of part C of the Project. Upon completion of the Project, the\nbalance in the project operation account will be transferred to the HDF, which will continue the\nhousing finance activities as specified in the Project. Small- and medium-scale contractors with\nadequate collateral will also apply to PCBs for construction loans based on approved low- to\nmiddle-income housing projects. Construction loan financing will be at interest rates similar to\nthat for housing loans, but the duration will be shorter (maximum of two years) to coincide with\nthe duration of the construction period.\n3.  Part B: Poverty Reduction through HAAP Schemes\n58.    For part B, MOFE will relend funds to provincial governments under an SLA with the\nconcerned provincial government. However, to obtain a greater impact on poverty in part B,\nMOFE will relend the funds to the provincial governments at the same cost of funds for MOFE\nas  in  part  A,38  for  a  term  of  20  years,  including  a  5  year  grace  period.    The  provincial\ngovernment will onlend the loan proceeds to the relevant local government on the same terms\nand conditions.  These terms will allow the local governments to establish a revolving fund at\nthe  local  level  for  developing  various  types  of  HAAP  schemes.  The  participating  local\ngovernment will be responsible for providing collateral and guaranteeing repayment of the loan\nthrough funds earmarked for this purpose in its annual budget.\n59.    Legally registered, community-based organizations (CBOs) will be established in each\nger community to be upgraded, to plan, implement, and maintain the HAAP upgrading projects.\nEach household in the ger upgrading area will become a member of the CBO. Functioning as a\nconstruction company, the CBO will be contracted by the municipality to build the project.\nResident workers will be paid standard rates, which will enable close to 60 percent of the\nupgrading costs to be injected into the community economy. The CBO will sign an agreement\nwith the city government to repay the cost of the infrastructure and will work out individual\npayment schedules with its residents to achieve this goal. The government will also contribute\n25 percent of the cost of the upgrading project.39 An amount equal to the annual repayment will\nbe required to be allocated in the budget and maintained throughout the period of the loan. Both\nloan and neighborhood repayments will be deposited into a special, local bank account created\nexpressly for HAAP projects. Establishment of this bank account and of the CBO or construction\ncompany will be a condition of disbursement of ADB loan proceeds for a HAAP.  The local\ngovernment will be responsible for the sale and/or auction of leases for the in-fill plots ensuring\nfull cost recovery. Each ger housing area being upgraded will be required to form a legal entity,\neither a CBO or community construction company, that will enter into a binding contract or legal\npartnership with the local government to implement the HAAP upgrading project.\n60.    For ger housing area upgrading HAAPs to be included in the Project, residents will be\nrequired to make a formal commitment to finance a substantial amount of the upgrading costs.\nMaximum cost recovery will be achieved to the extent possible through community payments.\nGer housing area neighborhoods seeking to participate in HAAP upgrading will be required to\nsave and deposit a down-payment in a special CBO account prior to the start of construction.\nThis deposit will confirm the neighborhood\u2019s commitment to the upgrading effort and allow the\n                  \n38Estimated at 10 percent per annum.\n39 Zuunmod City has allocated 25 percent in its 2002 budget, under preparation, towards developing HAAP schemes.", "19\nlocal government to evaluate its eligibility for benefiting from the loan. HAAP schemes designed\nfor Darkhan and Zuunmod, where local governments are committed to the HAAP approach, will\nbe the first to receive funding under the Project.  The component is projected to increase\ngradually, absorbing about $3.5 million over five years for financing an additional 14 HAAP\nupgrading and infill subprojects in Ulaanbaatar and small- and medium-sized towns in other\nprovinces. Based on the results of the field surveys, project lending will have a significant\npositive  leveraging  effect  on  ultimate  housing  investment.  The  Project  could  stimulate\ninvestment up to 100 percent of the ADB loan amount in beneficiary contributions.\n4. Implementation Schedule\n \n61.    Because  of  the  extreme  weather  during  winter  months,  the  construction  season  in\nMongolia is limited to about six months. The Project is, therefore, expected to be implemented\nover a five-year period from 2002 to 2006 with construction occurring mostly in 2002-2005 and\ncompletion of some of the remaining works and other project-related activities in 2006. To\nensure timely implementation, the PMU will prepare a detailed disbursement plan for the first\nyear of the Project, including finalization of draft SLAs and onlending agreements (OLAs) with\nthe PCBs and intermediaries. To facilitate timely loan effectiveness, draft SLAs for parts A and\nB of the Project have already been prepared.\n5.  Approval of Subprojects\n \n62.    For part A, the Borrower is required to submit the first five subloans to ADB for review\nand approval. The five pilot in-fill and upgrading HAAP subprojects in Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan,\nand Zuunmod to be financed under part B will also require prior ADB approval to ensure that\nrelevant ADB guidelines on procurement, environment, resettlement and compensation, and\nsocial dimensions are met. Each HAAP subproject proposal will include a detailed description of\n(i) subproject inputs and their cost; (ii) partnership arrangements of local governments, ger\nresidents, and the private sector; (iii) financing and cost recovery mechanisms; (iv) the extent of\nany subsidies involved; (v) resolution mechanisms for resettlement or compensation issues; and\n(vi) the implementation plan including institutional and beneficiary responsibilities, an initial\nenvironmental examination of the subproject, and the long-term management and financing\nplan. Equally important, the subproject description will discuss the measures incorporated to\nensure its sustainability and demonstration value.\n6.  Consulting Services\n63.    A  total  of  41  person-months  of  international  and  130  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting services will be required for capacity building and project implementation support.\nThe outline terms of reference are in Appendix 8. All consultants will be selected and engaged\nby  the  PMU  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other\narrangements acceptable to ADB on the selection and engagement of domestic consultants.\n7.  Advance Recruitment Action\n64.    Advance  action  has  been  approved  by  ADB  Management  to  expedite  project\nimplementation. Advance action, which may take place prior to loan effectiveness, includes\nrecruitment  of  domestic  and  international  consultants  for  capacity  building  and  project\nmanagement, up to but not including contract signing.  All advance recruitment of consultants\nwill  be  carried  out  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The\nGovernment was advised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance the\nProject.", "20\n8.  Procurement\n \n65.    Goods and services financed by ADB under the Project will be procured in accordance\nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement.  Procurement of equipment and vehicles valued at\n$500,000 equivalent or less will follow international shopping procedures. Small contracts with a\nvalue of $50,000 equivalent or less each may be awarded on the basis of direct purchase. Local\ncompetitive bidding may be undertaken for contract packages between $100,000 and $300,000\nequivalent.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  be\nawarded on the basis of local competitive bidding. Civil works estimated to cost the equivalent\nof $100,000 or less may be undertaken through force account because of the small size of such\ncontracts. A sample indicative procurement package for part B of the Project is in Appendix 9.\n9.  Disbursement\n \n66.    The Borrower will disburse subloans under the Project through (i) an imprest account to\nbe established at BOM immediately after the effective date of the Loan Agreement; or (ii) ADB\u2019s\ndirect payment, commitment, or reimbursement procedures. The imprest account will receive an\ninitial advance equivalent to the Borrower\u2019s anticipated disbursements to subborrowers over a\nsix-month  period.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and\nliquidated in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, as amended from time to\ntime. ADB's statement of expenditures procedure will be used to liquidate advances provided\ninto the imprest account. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not\nexceed $600,000 equivalent.\n 10. Project Supervision and Reporting Requirements\n \n67.    MOFE and MOI will assign to the PMU a project manager who will be responsible for\nproject supervision, monitoring, accounting, and reporting.  The PMU, on behalf of MOFE and\nMOI  will  submit  to  ADB  a  quarterly  progress  report  on  commitments  and  disbursements,\nimplementation status of approved subprojects, problems encountered during the quarter under\nreview including any material or adverse change in the Borrower\u2019s activities, action taken or\nproposed to be taken to remedy the problems, and the expected progress during the following\nquarter.  Also,  to  enhance  proactive  project  management,  brief  monthly  progress  reports\n(through facsimile and e-mail) will be encouraged. MOFE and the PMU will keep proper records\nof all onlending activities under part A, identifying the subborrower or intermediary; the size,\nterm, and interest rate of the loan(s) to subborrowers; the estimated number and income levels\nof beneficiaries; the purpose(s) and use(s) of loans to the beneficiaries; and the average size,\nterm, and interest rate of loans to the beneficiaries.  Under part B, the PMU will monitor the (i)\nfinancial performance of HAAP subprojects including land auctions for infill sites, (ii) loans from\nthe provinces to the city government, (iii) CBO contracts and repayment performance, and (iv)\nimpact on community poverty alleviation.\n11. Accounts and Audit\n \n68.    The PMU will maintain records and accounts in accordance with sound accounting\nprinciples, with sufficient detail to identify subloans and subprojects financed by the proceeds of\nthe investment loan and to disclose the use under the Project.  These principles are detailed in\nthe Project Accounting Manual, which was prepared40 to record activities for all ADB-funded\nprojects in Mongolia.  The accounts (including financial statements, statements of expenditure,\nand  imprest  account  records)  will  be  audited  annually,  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing\n                  \n40TA 2993-MON: Capacity Building in Project Accounting in Mongolia, for $150,000, approved on 10 March 1998.", "21\nstandards by auditors acceptable to ADB. The PMU, local governments, and PCBs, will submit\nto ADB certified copies of their annual audited financial statements and the auditor\u2019s report and\nmanagement letter within six months of completion of the fiscal year.  In addition to the audited\nproject accounts, the PMU will submit audited annual financial statements throughout the life of\nthe loan. MOFE and the PMU will also submit to ADB, not later than three months after the loan\nclosing  date,  a  completion  report  on  loan  utilization,  subproject  implementation,  and  the\nperformance of intermediaries and subborrowers with respect to onlending funds to low-income\nhouseholds for housing purchase, construction, or improvement. MOFE, MOI, and the PCBs\nwere informed of ADB\u2019s new policy on submission of audited financial statements and the strict\npenalties for noncompliance. In addition, under the SLAs between MOFE and each PCB, the\nPCB will be required to maintain full records relating to the subloans after the subloan is given.\nThe PMU and ADB may review and audit these records on a random basis.\n12. Anticorruption\n69.    During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added\nto  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  and\ncontractors to observe the highest standards of ethics in the procurement and execution of\nADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the\nanticorruption provisions added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed.\nThe  capacity  of  MOFE  and  MOI  to  prevent  potentially  corrupt  practices  will  be  enhanced\nthrough the capacity building activities under the project management and capacity building\ncomponents.\n13. Periodic Reviews\n70.    ADB  will  conduct  periodic  reviews  of  the  management,  financial,  and  operational\nperformance of MOFE and the PMU with respect to project activities and their compliance with\nimplementation of the Policy and Institutional Action Plan. In addition, a midterm review will be\nundertaken by ADB and the Government two years after project implementation begins. The\nobjectives of the midterm review will be to (i) review the progress achieved relative to the targets\nset for each project component; (ii) assess the degree of accomplishments in meeting the Policy\nand Institutional Action Plan targets and revised targets as appropriate; (iii) reexamine the\nproject design, implementation arrangements, and other relevant aspects; and (iv) formulate,\nwithin the updated sector setting, any changes to ensure successful project implementation,\nachievement of project objectives, and sustainability of project benefits. Feedback from the\nproject performance monitoring system (PPMS) activities will be analyzed.\n14. Project Performance Management System\n71.    MOFE and the PMU will ensure that a comprehensive program for project monitoring\nand evaluation, acceptable to ADB, is undertaken to systematically generate data on inputs and\noutputs under parts A and B of the Project. The PMU, assisted by the consultants, will finalize\nproject performance indicators and establish baseline conditions in consultation with concerned\nlocal governments, PCBs, intermediaries, and other local stakeholders for the purpose of project\nmonitoring and evaluation. This will include socioeconomic and environmental data to monitor\nand measure project impacts. MOFE and the PMU will refine the PPMS framework, confirm\nachievable goals, firm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and\nprocedures.", "22\n72.    Under  the  PPMS  framework,  baseline  and  annual  data  will  be  reported  at  regular\nintervals by the PMU. The PMU will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the data\nthrough its management information system. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate\nflexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, schedule, activity and development\nimpacts. The PMU will monitor and assess activities, and report to ADB quarterly on the\nimplementation and financial aspects of the Project to ensure that impacts are monitored and\nreported in line with ADB requirements. Regarding part A, the PMU, together with ADB, will\nconduct reviews six months and twelve months after the date when the first SLA with a PCB is\nexecuted. The reviews will assess matters relating to the implementation of the credit line,\nincluding  percentage  of  loan  proceeds  disbursed;  the  types  of  subborrowers  and  their\ngeographical location; the uses of loan proceeds by the subborrowers of the subloans; the\ninterest rates charged to PCBs, lending intermediaries, and subborrowers; and the performance\nof each. The finding of the reviews will be taken into account in the further implementation of\npart A of the Project.\n73.    For monitoring and evaluation, the collection and analysis of data from five surveys\nexecuted during the project preparatory TA has generated a large body of socioeconomic and\nphysical  benchmark  information.  In  addition,  under  part  A,  each  PCB  will  complete  an\napplication for subloans, which will contain details of subproject information on final borrowers,\nincluding household socioeconomic data on income and employment, loan size, use of the loan,\nand repayment terms. Under part B, each prospective local government wishing to participate in\nthe Project will complete an application form containing details of the subproject as well as\nsocioeconomic data on the families residing in the HAAP project area. PMU staff will verify data\non the application forms and fill any data gaps from additional available data, key informant\ninterviews, and/or focus groups. The HAAP database maintained by the HAAP Planning Unit in\nthe Government Implementing Agency for Construction, Urban Development and Public Utilities\nwill provide an additional source of information and become an integral part of the data for\nestablishing the socioeconomic profiles of cities and ger area communities.\nF. Borrower, Executing Agencies, and Subborrowers\n1. Ministry of Finance and Economy\n74.    Following the recent elections, MOFE has undergone a substantial reorganization and\nhas incorporated economic planning as one of its major functions. Under the new organization,\nit has seven departments including (i) integrated economic policy and planning; (ii) budget policy\nand  coordination  department;  (iii)  administration;  (iv)  government  funds  management  and\ncoordination;  (v)  economic  cooperation  management  and  coordination;  (vi)  sectoral\ndevelopment management and coordination; and (vii) information, monitoring and analysis,\nvaluation, and accounting.\n75.    The budget process, however, has remained the same. Funds flow from the central\nbudget  to  various  budget  entities  (over  5,000)  financed  by  the  central  budget,  including\nprovincial and district budgets. The budget process begins in July with districts submitting their\nbudget requests to their province and ends on 1 October when the consolidated budget is\nsubmitted to Parliament. Parliament must approve the budget before 1 December, and the\nappropriations  and  subsidies  to  the  provinces  must  also  be  approved  by  MOFE  before  1\nDecember. Under part B of the Project, for Zuunmod and Darkhan to receive loans, they must\nfirst submit the required amounts to their district administrations for approval. As the capital city,\nUlaanbaatar would submit loan requests directly to MOFE.", "23\n76.    Departments  of  MOFE  also  are  responsible  for  several  functions  related  to  the\nsuccessful implementation of the Project. The responsibilities of the Sectoral Development\nManagement and Coordination Department include the (i) coordination of immovable property\nassessment issues, (ii) the organizational structure of commercial banks, (iii) the coordination of\nmortgage  policy,  and  (iv)  the  improvement  of  debt  collection  by  commercial  banks.  The\ninformation, monitoring and analysis, valuation and accounting department is also responsible\nfor the control and registration of state property. Both the State Immovable Property Committee\nand the Office of Immovable Property Registration report directly to MOFE.\n2. Bank of Mongolia\n77.    The imprest account and project operation account will be opened at BOM. Since the\n1996 banking crisis, BOM has maintained a tight monetary policy aimed at stabilizing the value\nof the currency and reducing the inflation rate. BOM has also substantially strengthened bank\nsupervision  with  rigorous  enforcement  of  prudential  regulations.  It  supports  Government\nmonetary and investment policy by providing domestic financing (45 percent of the total in 1998)\nand extending credit to Government (43 percent of total credit in 1998).\n78.    As the principal banking regulatory authority, BOM has complete access to the financial\ndetails of all commercial banks operating in the country and can monitor banking activities on a\ncontinual  basis  and  make  informed  judgements  as  to  the  suitability  of  individual  banks\nparticipating in various projects. Because it is simultaneously implementing a number of projects\nthat  involve  granting  loans  to  financial  institutions,  BOM  can  coordinate  project  loans  and\nprevent unintended overloading of borrowing capacities. At the same time, it can monitor how\nPCBs are managing asset and liability maturities. Under the proposed Project, BOM will work\nwith MOFE to evaluate banks\u2019 suitability to participate in the Project; select which banks will\nparticipate initially; determine the extent of their borrowing; and monitor the banks' performance,\neffectiveness, and eligibility on an ongoing basis.\n3. Participating Commercial Banks\na. Preliminary Review\n79.    To evaluate the financial soundness of commercial banks in Mongolia as well as their\nsuitability to participate in the proposed Project, recent financial statements and operating data\nof 10 of the 12 commercial banks currently operating in the country were collected and reviewed\nas of 31 July 2000. As a result of the review, the list of PCBs eligible to participate in the Project\nwas  reduced  to  three:  Golomt  Bank,  Mongol  Post  Bank  (MPB),  TDBM.  The  financial\nperformance and projections of the PCBs are in Appendix 10.\nb. Eligibility Criteria for PCBs\n80.    The World Bank PSDC41 is designed on principles that are very similar to those of the\nProject.  Banking concerns and requirements between the two projects are almost congruent\nand the Project has therefore been designed to minimize conflicting PCB eligibility requirements\nwith the PSDC and to build on the existing regulatory framework.  Since the PSDC\u2019s eligibility\ncriteria for PCB participation are comprehensive and well crafted, the Project uses these criteria\nwith only a few modifications, including the increase in the length of experience required by\nstart-up banks from two to three years. Appendix 7 lists eligibility criteria. The Project will also\nuse BOM\u2019s prudential norms for compliance purposes, as well as BOM\u2019s reporting procedures.\n                  \n41For $12 million, approved in May 1999.", "24\nc.  Analysis of the Selected PCBs\n81.    The  three  PCBs  were  examined  in  more  detail  to  determine  their  suitability  for\nparticipation in the Project, including detailed assessments of their past (1997-2000) financial\nand operational performance and projected financial position (2001-2003). Two of the PCBs,\nTDBM and Golomt Bank  are participating in the World Bank PSDC. The PSDC report indicates\nthe superior performance of TDBM and Golomt vis a vis the rest of the banking system. They\nhave a satisfactory level of loans/deposit ratio, and a much higher ratio of well performing loans\n(over 90 percent of total loans, compared to about 60 percent for the total banking sector as of\n31 January 1999).\n82.    Golomt Bank. Golomt  is the largest privately owned bank in Mongolia and the second\nmost active lender in the country with nine retail branches and more than 22,000 depositors.\nGolomt\u2019s 1999 financial statements were audited by an international auditing firm, resulting in an\nunqualified and positive opinion.  The bank has been consistently profitable, its loan loss\nreserve meets BOM\u2019s standards, and it has an internal governance structure that conforms to\ncontemporary banking practice. Golomt\u2019s managerial and organizational capacity to participate\nin the Project and to successfully generate, underwrite, process, and collect project loans is\nstrong. During participation in the World Bank PSDC and the corresponding TA, Golomt has\nstrengthened its credit and management information systems operations. Golomt has concrete\nplans to increase its capital, either through earnings retention or additional investment by June\n2001, which will enhance its absorptive capacity. As with all other PCBs, Golomt will need\ntraining related to housing financial issues, as well as issues surrounding lending to individuals.\nAfter receiving this training, the bank should be a capable participant in the Project.\n83.    Mongol Post Bank. MPB is a private bank with branches in all 21 provincial capitals.\nSignificantly smaller in total assets than Golomt or TDBM, MPB has a large customer base of\nover  18,000  depositors,  and  has  been  an  active  lender  in  the  country\u2019s  banking  sector.\nConstruction and industrial lending account for about 40 percent of its business and trade for\nabout 30 percent.  MPB has recently been quite profitable, with 19.4 percent annualized return\non equity through the first seven months of 2000. MPB underwent its first independent audit by\nan international audit firm in early 2000. MPB is planning to raise an additional MNT1.5 billion\n($1.4 million) in paid in capital by June 2001, strengthening the bank\u2019s capital position. This will\nbring the bank\u2019s risk weighted capital adequacy ratio well above 30 percent and significantly\nincrease its absorptive capacity. MPB is an experienced industrial lender, and in 2001 it will\nstrengthen credit skills through participation in a TA program financed by Kreditanstalt fuer\nWiederaufbau (KfW). MPB management has expressed a strong desire to participate in the\nProject.\n84.    Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia. TDBM Licensed in 1991, is the dominant\ncommercial  bank  in  the  country,  accounting  for  approximately  45  percent  of  the  country\u2019s\nbanking assets. The bank is primarily focused on corporate customers, and therefore has a\nrelatively small customer base of over 9,600 depositors. TDBM is well advanced in terms of\norganizational  structure,  staff  training,  modern  banking  management  practices,  and  formal\nbusiness discipline and has been very profitable in recent years, earning more than 40 percent\non equity. The bank is 70 percent owned by the Government, with the remaining 30 percent\nheld by employees. Privatization of TDBM is under way in accordance with a recent decree\nissued  in  parliament.  TDBM  has  undergone  independent  international  audits  since  1997,\nreceiving unqualified opinions for each of the three years. TDBM\u2019s management capacity and\norganization are strong. TDBM has benefited from large amounts of TA in the past, and it has a\nwell-defined and well-functioning credit department.", "25\n4. Local Governments\n85.    To determine the borrowing capacity of local governments under part B of the Project,\nfinancial statements and budget allocations of the three towns selected for the Project were\nreviewed. In Ulaanbaatar, revenue collected covered total expenditure until 1997, and the city\ndid not receive subventions from the central budget. About 82.5 percent of Ulaanbaatar\u2019s total\nrevenue is generated through personal taxes, company taxes, value-added tax (VAT), and\nnontax sources. On the expenditure side, salaries and expenses on goods and service make up\nthe  vast  majority  (85  percent)  of  total  expenditure.  Comparing  total  revenue  and  total\nexpenditure from 1997 to 2000, total revenue raised during that period covered only 90.5\npercent of total expenditure. The remaining 9.5 percent is a loss that has been carried over from\nyear to year.\n86.    In Darkhan, an average of 88.5 percent of total revenue was generated through personal\ntaxes,  company  taxes,  excise  taxes,  and  nontax  sources.  Salaries,  goods,  and  services\nexpenses averaged 90.8 percent of total expenditure. On average, over the past three years,\nthe town has covered 25.6 percent of total expenditure from its own source revenue, 69.5\npercent was funded by the central budget, and the remaining 4.9 percent was reported as a\nloss. Between 1997 and 2000, funds received from the central budget were on average 2.8\ntimes the town\u2019s own revenue.\n87.    In Zuunmod, over the last four years, an average of 84.3 percent of total revenue was\ngenerated  through  personal  taxes,  company  taxes,  excise  taxes,  and  nontax  sources.\nExpenditures on salaries and goods and services constituted 88.6 percent of total expenditure.\nOn average, over the past four years, the town covered only 31.5 percent of total expenditure\nfrom its own revenues and 68.5 percent was funded by the central budget. Similar to Darkhan,\nover the last four years, funds from the central budget were on average 2.3 times its own\nrevenue.\n88.    Investment,  which  includes  major  repairs,  was  a  very  small  portion  of  budget\nexpenditure in all four project cities, averaging only about 7 percent in Ulaanbaatar and 3.8\npercent  in  Zuunmod.  Project  loans  for  HAAP  schemes  will  be  relent  through  the  HDF  to\nprovincial governments and then on-lent to the cities. Provincial governments will ultimately be\nresponsible for repaying the loan to the HDF. Since they provide a large part of each city\u2019s\nannual budget, they should be able to work out acceptable repayment arrangements for cities in\nwhich HAAP projects are located. More diligent application of the VAT at the city level will\nprovide these cities with greater revenues from which to contribute 25 percent of project costs\nand to repay their loans. In each case, an amount equal to the annual repayment to the HDF will\nbe earmarked in the annual budgets of the provincial government and participating cities. To\nfurther ensure repayment, serviced in-fill plots will be publicly auctioned for at least the cost of\ninfrastructure, while ger housing area communities benefiting from upgrading HAAPs will be\nrequired to pay the cost of infrastructure under an agreement with the city.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n89.    Environmental implications under parts A and B of the Project were reviewed. Based on\nan assessment of the anticipated environmental impact of the Project, no significant negative\neffects were identified.", "26\n90.    Part A will make available housing finance for the construction, upgrading, and purchase\nof housing for low- and middle-income families. By doing so, the proposed Project will improve\nenvironmental conditions within and around houses, which will contribute to a better quality of\nlife, improved family health, and greater environmental awareness and pride of community.\nHousing financed under the Project will have a strong positive impact on the immediate housing\nenvironment for women and children who spend much of their time at home. The use of solid,\nbetter quality building materials and construction practices will reduce household vulnerability to\nfire, building collapse, rodents, and flooding or standing water. Part B will finance small-scale\nimprovements to infrastructure and services in selected ger housing areas. Subprojects will\nhave direct positive impacts on family health and the surrounding environment by improving\ncommunity water supply and sanitation, solid waste management, and drainage. The active\ninvolvement  of  local  communities  in  the  conception,  implementation,  financing,  and\nmaintenance of pilot HAAP subprojects will complement and reinforce these benefits, ensure\ncost recovery and sustainability, create subproject ownership, and promote greater awareness\nof  environmental  issues.  Both  parts  of  the  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the\ndevelopment of the cities through the master plans. The only potential adverse environmental\nimpact  of  the  proposed  Project  would  be  the  possible  disruption  of  public  services  and\ntransportation during the construction phase. However, given the relatively small-scale and\nlabor-intensive nature of construction, these disruptions are expected to be minor and can be\neasily mitigated through appropriate measures. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) will be\nprepared for each HAAP subproject to identify and minimize potential adverse environmental\nimpacts.\n2. Social Analysis\n91.    Extensive  surveys  were  undertaken  for  over  1,100  households.  Results  have  been\nsummarized for four complementary surveys covering household characteristics and housing\ndemand  in  Ulaanbaatar,  Darkhan,  and  Choibalsan;  ger  housing  area  characteristics  and\nresources in Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan, and Zuunmod; active and potential housing contractors in\nUlaanbaatar and Darkhan; and recent apartment and ger housing sales in Ulaanbaatar. For part\nA, the PMU will work closely with selected PCBs and financial intermediaries to establish a\nviable and effective lending process that will improve housing conditions and the quality of life\nfor low- and middle-income households. Part B will concentrate on developing and financing a\nseries of HAAP schemes, which will entail a high degree of community involvement and result in\npositive socioeconomic impacts on communities as well as poverty reduction in the ger housing\nareas.\n3. Profile of Project Beneficiaries\n92.    For part A, a major category of beneficiaries will be low- and middle-income urban\nhouseholds regularly employed by public and private enterprises. Low-income households will\nbe able to afford monthly loan repayments from $18-$46 (MNT20,000-MNT51,000)  and middle\nincome households, $47-$227 (MNT52,000-MNT250,000). For part B, beneficiaries will include\nall households living in HAAP upgrading schemes in ger housing areas. Based on survey\nresults, the portion of households below the poverty line in the ger housing areas is 29 percent\nin Ulaanbaatar, 52 percent in Darkhan, and 60 percent in Zuunmod. These households will\nbenefit directly from project-financed improvements. Survey results have shown that many of\nthese households could improve their quality of life significantly by obtaining relatively small but\nessential housing loans.", "27\n4. Beneficiary Impacts\n93.    The Project will result in positive impacts for beneficiaries at both the household and\ncommunity levels. For parts A and B, about 18,000 low- and middle-income households and\n7,000 households in the ger housing areas will benefit from the Project. Beneficiaries will\nachieve a greater degree of residential and household stability as the result of obtaining a\nvaluable and appreciating fixed asset, which can be used to establish acceptable collateral for\nadditional credit. At the community level, the creation of employment and local construction\nmaterials will stimulate the development and expansion of local economy. Under parts A and B,\nabout 32,000 person-years of construction-related employment opportunities will be generated\nwithin the five-year implementation period. The value added to the local population includes\ndeveloping and expanding construction materials related enterprises as well as associated\nemployment  and  income.  In  addition,  households  in  ger  housing  areas  will  benefit  from\nimproved infrastructure and services, wider choice of fully-serviced in-fill plots, home-based\nbusiness  activities,  community-based  economic  development,  improved  health  status  for\nproductive activities, and a healthier and comfortable living environment. Other positive impacts,\nsuch as savings of labor and time due to the improved water supply and road, and increased\nsafety resulting from street lighting are also expected.\n5. Impact on Women\n94.    Based on data from the National Statistics Office about 25 percent of the households in\nMongolia  are  households  headed  by  females,  of  which  about  40  percent  are  poor.  The\nproposed  Project  will  benefit  this  group  both  through  parts  A,  B,  and  C.  Female-headed\nhouseholds will account for about 30 percent of the borrowers of housing loans under part A.\nThis is consistent with the National Poverty Alleviation Program, which recognizes households\nheaded by females as one of the most vulnerable groups in the country. Access to affordable\nhousing  loans  will  provide  women  with  important  physical  and  financial  assets,  which  will\nsubstantially increase their status and security within the household as well as the community.\nWomen and children of very low-income households are particularly affected by the current poor\nliving conditions in the ger housing areas, such as inadequate water supply, poor drainage,\nstreet lighting and irregular solid waste removal. As they spend most of their time at home and\nin the communities, the improved daily living environment as a result of part B of the Project will\nreduce the vulnerability of women and children to water- and air-borne diseases and associated\nsuffering. Further, because of time and labor savings resulting from the Project, they will have\nmore time for productive income-generating activities, home businesses, and caring for family\nmembers.\n6. Community Participation\n95.    Direct public involvement has been an ongoing element in the development and design\nof the Project. During project preparation, local communities were extensively involved in the\ndesign of the Project through a series of surveys and focus groups. Part B will be particularly\ncommunity-driven for subproject planning, implementation, and maintenance. Nearly all of the\nsurveyed households in the ger housing areas emphasized the need for community participation\nand their willingness to be involved in subproject planning. As part of the project design, CBOs\nwill be formed under the HAAP schemes to represent the interest of the residents in the ger\nhousing areas. The ownership of the subprojects by the local people and the community-driven\ninitiatives  will  be  strongly  supported  by  the  Project.  The  improvement  of  community\ninfrastructure and services in the ger housing areas will emphasize delivering basic services to\nthe poor, and empowering the local population to promote their own community development by\nestablishing CBOs. Partnerships will be built between CBOs and local governments to work", "28\nclosely  on  improving  the  ger  housing  areas  for  housing,  infrastructure,  services,  and\nmaintenance. Such partnerships are likely to be replicated in other communities throughout the\ncountry.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n96.    The lack of finance to build new or improve existing housing in Mongolia has led to an\nalarming deterioration in the formal housing stock and the rapid growth of informal ger housing\nareas, both of which directly affect the quality of life of low-income households. While low-\nincome  households  in  apartments  have  experienced  a  deterioration  of  services  and\ninfrastructure, those in ger housing areas have minimal services and infrastructure or none at\nall. According to the comprehensive household survey undertaken in preparation for the Project,\nthere is an overwhelming demand by urban households, to improve their housing conditions and\ntake loans to do so. About 91 percent of the respondents across six categories of housing\nwanted to improve their housing conditions and about 80 percent of these would take loans to\ndo so. Through different lending modalities, the Project is expected to directly benefit about\n25,000 households with various types of housing loans, including nearly 7,000, mostly low-\nincome households in ger housing areas, with improved infrastructure. In addition, ADB funds\nwill serve to leverage financial contributions on behalf of the PCBs and intermediary lending\ninstitutions such as private and public enterprises and medium- and small-scale contractors.\n97.    Given  the  basic  linkage  between  improved  housing  and  human  welfare,  human\ndevelopment will be enhanced by the provision of new and/or improved housing at affordable\nprices and with meaningful community participation. Although many of the benefits that will\naccrue as a result of improved housing conditions are difficult to quantify, most are based on the\nconnection to improved health and its relation to increased productivity. The availability of loans\nfor housing will also enable low-income households to establish credit records. In addition, basic\ninfrastructure  and  essential  services  will  be  provided  as  part  of  the  HAAP  infrastructure\nsubprojects.\nA. Financial and Economic Analysis\n98.    The methodology adopted to evaluate the economic benefits is in accordance with the\nADB\u2019s Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector\nProjects and ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.\n99.    Extensive surveys demonstrated a strong demand for the Project. To assess affordability\nfor the infrastructure improvements under part B of the Project, the cost for upgrading was\nestimated and expressed as a percentage of total average incomes for two out of three pilot\nsites. It was found that a contribution equivalent to 5 percent of current community income over\na period of three years, would recover costs. 42\n100.    Given this demand, economic analysis of the project was undertaken. Detailed financial\nand economic internal rate of return (EIRR) analysis could not be undertaken for part A since\nneither the precise location nor final size, terms, and uses of the loans are available. At this\nstage, it is also impossible to know the total number of borrowers in each income category and\nthe  relative  number  of  loans  that  will  be  used  for  new  construction,  house  completion,\nrenovation, and upgrading.\n                  \n42Cost recovery through user rates for the current World Bank-sponsored ger housing area upgrading was based on\nhouseholds paying 1 percent of their income over a 12-year period. Applying a higher rate of 5 percent over a\nshorter period of three years was considered to be more desirable by surveyed residents and more realistic. Poor\nhouseholds would be able to contribute labor as part of their payment for infrastructure.", "29\n101.    A  representative  pilot  upgrading  scheme  in  Darkhan  was  selected  to  illustrate  the\neconomic benefits of part B (Appendix 11). The Project was found to be viable with an EIRR of\n50.9 percent. This figure indicates the project is very desirable, but the result is sensitive to\nbenefit assumptions.\n102.    The benefit used for the EIRR calculations was the expected increase in land value\nresulting  from  project  investments.  However,  HAAP  type  of  residential  upgrading  projects\nproduce a number of unquantified benefits, including (i) employment benefits due to community\nparticipation  in  construction  of  infrastructure  and  services;  (ii)  home-based  employment\nfacilitated by improved infrastructure and shelter conditions; (iii) health benefits resulting from\nimproved  water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage,  and  solid  waste  management;  (iv)  increased\nproductivity due to time savings from improved water delivery, less absenteeism, and greater\naccess to education due to improved health and access to work and schools; and (vi) safety\nbenefits and less property damage due to reduced flooding and fires. These benefits will go\nespecially to the low-income and poor groups in the community and a high proportion of the\nbeneficiaries will be women.\n1. Affordability\n103.    Affordability analyses were carried out for parts A and B to ensure that loans provided\nunder  the  project  components  will  not  create  an  undue  financial  burden  on  the  ultimate\nbeneficiaries. Loan repayments for different loan sizes were calculated on a monthly basis and\ncompared,  with  the  range  of  minimum  and  maximum  monthly  incomes  of  low-income\nhouseholds43  earning  $73-$182  (MNT80,000-MNT200,000)  per  month;  and  middle-income\nhouseholds earning $183-$910 (MNT201,000-MNT1,000,000) per month.\n104.    Low-income borrowers will be able to afford loans up to a maximum of $2,184 (MNT2.4\nmillion) and middle-income borrowers with monthly incomes up to $910 (MNT1.0 million) will be\nable to borrow up to $10,828 (MNT11.9 million). A major finding of the field surveys is that\nborrowers of housing loans will contribute at least the equivalent of the loan to the cost or\nconstruction of the house, while borrowers who wish to buy apartments will contribute some 30\npercent of the cost of the apartment. Therefore, assuming a loan-to-value ratio of 50 percent, a\nloan of $2,184 (MNT2.4 million) will enable low-income borrowers to upgrade housing in ger\nhousing areas or construct small houses (48 square meters) on ger plots worth about $4,368\n(MNT4.8 million). A loan of $5,460 (MNT6.0 million) will allow middle-income borrowers earning\n$455 (MNT500,000) per month to build private house on a new plot or buy an apartment for\n$7,734  (MNT8.5  million).  The  latter  amount  is  more  than  the  average  price  of  one-room\napartments in Ulaanbaatar $7,098 (MNT7.8 million), and is within the range of ger housing area\ndwellers wishing to pay for an apartment $6,825-$9,100 (MNT7.5 million to MNT10.0 million).\nLoans  of  $9,737  (MNT10.7  million)  will  give  middle-income  borrowers  the  means  to  buy\ncontractor-built housing worth $19,110 (MNT21.0 million) or a 3 to 4 room apartment worth\nabout $13,649 (MNT15 million).\n105.    To estimate affordability for the infrastructure improvements under the HAAP schemes in\npart B of the Project, a percentage of total average incomes for each pilot site was calculated.\nThe estimated total incomes of the three pilot areas were $171,974 (MNT189 million) per month\nfor  the  selected  site  in  Ulaanbaatar,  $121,019  (MNT133  million)  per  month  for  the  pilot\nupgrading project in Darkhan, and $25,478 (MNT28 million) per month for the pilot project in\n                  \n43The household incomes quoted are based on the extensive households surveys of over 1,100 households\nundertaken in close consultation with the National Statistics Office.", "30\nZuunmod. A community contribution of 5 percent of current community income over a period of\nthree years, would achieve affordable cost recovery for both the Darkhan and Zuunmod pilot\nupgrading projects. The community will be responsible for determining the size and manner of\ncontributions from very poor households.\n2. Sustainability\n106.    Establishing a full market-based sustainable housing finance system in Mongolia will\ntake some time. The HL, NHS and HPVTL and condominium assocation amendments passed\nin  1999  have  established  a  market-oriented  legal  and  policy  framework  in  the  Mongolian\nhousing sector. Also, the recent amendments to the Civil Code with respect to use of immovable\nproperty as collateral and granting authority to banks to possess the collateralized property from\nborrowers failing to repay a loan provide sufficient safeguards against defaulters. While more\nwork is to be done, particularly, concerning the land legislation, the Project has several features\nthat strengthen the basis for accomplishing the long-term objective of establishing a sustainable\nhousing finance system in Mongolia. First, the establishment of a revolving fund at the HDF and\na commitment by PCBs to lend their own money help assure sustainability. Also, the difference\nbetween the relending rate to PCBs and the cost of funds to the HDF will accrue to the HDF.\nSecond, part C of the Project will significantly strengthen the PCBs to undertake mortgage\nbased lending so that direct lending to individuals can be started by year three. Until the\ncapacity of the PCBs is sufficiently built, lending will be mainly to private and public enterprises\nfor on-lending to their employees. Third, the comprehensive policy dialogue agenda under the\nProject focuses on establishing appropriate and sustainable mechanisms for housing finance.\nFourth, lending at market rates through PCBs, which are the only institutions with experience in\nloan  origination  and  recovery  procedures,  represents  the  best  mechanism  for  building  a\nsustainable  housing  finance  system.  Finally,  making  the  passage  of  the  new  land  law  a\ncondition for loan disbursement to individuals will further strengthen sustainability of the Project.\n107.    The Project is designed to have long-term benefits by improving the quality of life of an\never-increasing portion of the population in need of improved shelter and urban services. The\nestablishment of a sustainable housing finance system will open new markets for the banking\nsector and strengthen small- and medium-scale contractors to provide affordable housing to\nlow- and middle-income families. Key conditions for sustainability of the Project will be the ability\nof PCBs to assimilate housing finance skills so that they will begin to increasingly lend their own\nfunds to public and private enterprises and individual borrowers; the ability and commitment of\nlending  intermediaries  and  individual  borrowers  to  effectively  use  the  funds  for  housing\npurposes;  the  ability  of  the  PMU  to  attract,  train,  and  retain  qualified  staff;  and  effective\ncommunication to subborrowers of the terms and conditions of borrowing so that they repay in a\ntimely manner. To achieve these conditions, on-lending arrangements have been structured to\nprovide the PCBs with sufficient spreads to cover their operating costs and risk premiums and\nprovide an adequate margin. Semiannual reviews of on-lending and relending rates have been\nprovided to avoid asset-liability mismatches, especially if inflation recurs during the Project\nperiod or rate levels decline precipitously. Upon completion of project implementation, the PCBs\nare expected to be making housing loans primarily with their own resources. In addition, the\nestablishment of a substantial revolving fund at the HDF could allow the HDF to evolve into\nhousing bank by refinancing PCB loans, i.e., taking PCBs out of their primary loans, rather than\nrelending directly to them.\n108.    Part  B  of  the  Project  will  achieve  sustainability  if,  upon  completion  of  Project\nimplementation, (i) the HDF continues to make loans to local governments for new sites and\nupgrading  HAAPs  based  on  successful  implementation  of  previous  HAAP  subprojects,  (ii)\nHAAP subprojects have been successfully integrated into new master plans for Mongolian", "31\ncities, (iii) successful cost recovery under HAAP subprojects has created sustainable revolving\nfunds in participating cities and instilled an appreciation of paying for the delivery of urban\nservices, and (iv) the development and testing of institutional and implementation arrangements\nhave gained central and local government support and are firmly in place.\nB.  Social Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n109.    The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction44  by  (i)  establishing  a  financing\nmechanism  to  increase  the  access  of  the  urban  poor  to  housing,  (ii)  creating  short-term\nemployment  opportunities  mostly  for  the  poor  resulting  from  increased  investment  in  the\nhousing construction sector, and (iii) improving urban infrastructure and related services to\nenhance the living standards and productivity of low-income households. In conjunction with\npart B, a proposal is being prepared for financing under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction\n(JFPR). The JFPR Project will help strengthen the financial capability of HAAP upgrading\ncommunities by providing (i) an economic rationale to establish legally-registered CBOs to help\nlead loan-funded upgrading efforts and to create community-level economic infrastructure that\nwill benefit from the HAAP provided infrastructure;  (ii) the capital financing for establishing\ncommunity  income  generation  centers  to  help  poor  households;  (iii)  the  financing  for\nestablishing community-operated bathhouses, greenhouses, and women\u2019s workshops; and (iv)\nthe financing for community training and capacity building to sustain economic development and\nencourage additional improvements in the future.45\n110.    As a result of the Project, the increased employment opportunities and income during\nproject construction will be one of the primary benefits to the poor. In addition, a substantial\nnumber of jobs will be created through the development initiatives and expanded businesses\ninduced by the Project. In socioeconomic terms, improved water supply, drainage, sanitation,\nand solid waste collection will lead to reduced mortality and morbidity among the beneficiary\npoor households. This will in turn result in increased income in terms of less days lost at work,\nless school absenteeism, and less time at medical clinics and therefore reduced medical costs.\nThe actual tangible and intangible benefits to the poor may be greater, as these families are\noften more vulnerable in dealing with income and health problems. Paving of roads will also\nresult in labor and time savings benefits. The poverty impact assessment is in Appendix 12.\nC.  Risks\n111.    The main risks associated with the Project are (i) the lack of experience of the banking\nsystem in lending for housing; (ii) the vague nature of existing laws relating to use, possession,\nand enforcement of loan collateral; (iii) effectiveness of the Project to target loans to the most\ndeserving; and (iv) effective replication of the HAAP approach for community improvement and\nplanning.\n112.    The problems of the banking system have been well documented in preparing this and\nrelated ADB-financed projects. With the support of ADB and World Bank TA, the banking\nsystem  has  made  significant  progress  toward  becoming  a  viable  tool  for  the  country\u2019s\ndevelopment. Although the banking system has little or no experience with term lending, many\nbank managers have acquired the necessary asset-liability management and credit design\nskills, including well-documented loan agreements that are required for successful banking.\n                  \n44About 50 percent of the project beneficiaries will fall in the low-income bracket.\n45 The JFPR proposal received concept clearance from the ADB Strategy and Policy Department Poverty Reduction\nDivision.", "32\nAlso, FSPII, in cooperation with the World Bank\u2019s Financial Security Adjustment Credit, will\nmitigate the risk of faltering financial sector and banking reforms.\n113.    Sustainable housing finance markets are based on the collateral value of the property\nbeing financed, as well as the ability of the lender to take possession and dispose of the\nproperty. The passage, in January 2001, of the amendment to the Civil Code allowing banks to\neffectively  possess  and  dispose  of  loan  collateral  will  greatly  improve  the  functioning  of\nMongolia\u2019s  financial  markets,  especially  housing  finance.    In  addition,  due  to  the  lack  of\nindividual household collateral as well as land titles or leases, the Project has been designed for\nmost loans to be lent initially through private and public enterprises that possess adequate\ncollateral to guarantee their loans. To increase the supply of units for these entities, loans will\nalso be made to small- and medium-scale contractors for which the houses themselves will be\nthe collateral. Under part C of the Project, institutional strengthening will be provided to PCBs in\nhousing loan origination, underwriting, and collection to ensure the successful implementation of\nthe Project.\n114.    Field surveys for the Project have found a pervasive desire among urban households to\nimprove their housing situation through housing loans. The Project will develop strict lending\nguidelines for PCBs and intermediaries including rigorous selection criteria to ensure loans go to\nthe target beneficiaries of low- and middle-income households. Based on affordability, housing\nneed, and area of residence, such guidelines will give priority to households that presently do\nnot have dwellings and are doubled up with family and relatives.\n115.    The HAAP approach to upgrading ger housing area communities and planning new\nresidential sites is a new concept in Mongolia. The basic precept of the HAAP approach is that\nger housing communities are a permanent feature of the Mongolian urban landscape and, given\nadequate  infrastructure  and  services,  can  be  developed  into  viable  residential  areas.  This\nprecept is also contained in the HL and is a basic policy component of the present Government.\nImplementation of the HAAP approach is based on the priorities of the target communities as\nwell as a close partnership with the local governments. Such partnerships have been forged for\nthe  pilot  HAAP  schemes  in  Darkhan  and  Zuunmod.  The  Project  includes  comprehensive\nworkshops to continually educate city architects and local and central Government leaders to\npromote  the  adoption  and  replication  of  the  HAAP  approach  to  community  planning  and\ndevelopment.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n116.

In designing a part B subproject, the\nGovernment will ensure that involuntary resettlement is minimized to the extent\npossible. The Government will also ensure that the environmental mitigation\nmeasures  identified  in  the  IEE  are  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nenvironmental guidelines.\n(x)  The Government will ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with\nthe Government\u2019s land policies and urban development plans, and to the extent\napplicable,  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines  and  Policy  on  Involuntary\nResettlement.\nB.  Conditions for Disbursement\n117.    Conditions for disbursement are as follows:\n(i)  Prior to any disbursement for part A or B of the Project, the project operation\naccount  will  have  been  established  in  BOM,  and  the  PMU  will  have\nestablished a financial management system acceptable to ADB, including\ninternal financial and accounting controls.\n(ii)  For part A of the Project, the Government will have (a) prepared draft SLAs,\nOLAs, and housing loan contracts with terms and conditions acceptable to\nADB; and (b) finalized and approved HDF regulations acceptable to ADB.\nWith respect to a PCB, such PCB will have, inter alia, in a manner acceptable\nto ADB, (a) established a housing loan department and separate accounts for\nhousing lending; (b) formulated loan underwriting, servicing, and field audit\nprocedures to ensure that loans are made only to low- and middle-income\nhouseholds; and (c) executed with MOFE a part A SLA acceptable to ADB.\n(iii)  Prior  to  any  disbursement  for  a  subloan  from  a  PCB  to  an  individual\nsubborrower under part A of the Project, Parliament will have enacted a", "34\nrevised Land Law acceptable to ADB, including provisions allowing for the\nuse of a leasehold interest in land as loan collateral.\n(iv)  For part B, the Government will have prepared a draft HAAP SLA acceptable\nto ADB. In addition, the relevant participating local government will have, inter\nalia,  entered into a legal agreement with the provincial government, included\nthe subproject in its housing program, obtained approval from the citizens\nrepresentative committee, and formally committed to contributing twenty-five\npercent of the cost of the subproject. A CBO or community construction\ncompany will also have been established and entered into a legal agreement\nwith the local government to implement the subproject, and prior to subloan\ndisbursement for Ulaanbataar City, the city will have finalized and adopted an\nurban development strategy acceptable to ADB that is based on effective\nland  use  controls  and  the  application  of  HAAP  schemes  to  guide  urban\ndevelopment.\nVII.

Relending Mechanisms\n1. Flow of Funds\n1.  Following the approval of a participating commercial bank (PCB), the Ministry of Finance\nand  Economy  (MOFE)  will  enter  into  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  with  the  PCB.  The\nagreements with PCBs will be subject to approval by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), on a\nno-objection basis, and will include terms and conditions relevant to part A of the Project. The\nmaturity  of  loans  to  the  PCBs  will  be  equivalent  to  the  maximum  term  of  subloans  to\nsubborrowers, which will be maximum of seven years. The PCBs will on-lend funds to eligible\nsubborrowers. The PCBs will be required to contribute from their own resources 25 percent of\neach subloan. The PCBs will carry all credit risk and will be fully responsible for recoveries and\nfor  repayments  to  the  Government.  Subborrowers  will  have  a  six-month  grace  period  for\nrepayment of the subloan principal to the PCBs. The PCBs will also have a six-month grace\nperiod for repayment of the subloan to the special project account at the Bank of Mongolia\n(BOM).\n2.  Initial Eligibility Criteria for Participating Commercial Banks\n2.    The PCBs will be thoroughly examined to ensure that they are comply with the eligibility\ncriteria. Throughout the project period, the project management unit (PMU), in cooperation with\nBOM, will identify potential PCBs and undertake the first assessment. To be considered as a\npossible PCB, the commercial bank needs to be in compliance with the following prudential\nnorms  for  at  least  the  previous  six  months.  A  financial  institution  must  be  registered  and\nlicensed under the Banking Law for at least three years before acceptance as a PCB.\n(i)  Capital Adequacy. The minimum level of adjusted equity capital will be not less\nthan 10 percent of risk-weighted total assets.\n(ii)  Liquidity. The minimum level of liquid assets will be not less than 18 percent of\ntotal deposits and borrowed funds.\n(iii)  Maximum Loan. The maximum loan to any one borrower or group of related\nborrowers will not exceed 20 percent of total capital.\n(iv)  Insider Loans. The maximum loan to any one shareholder in the PCB will not\nexceed 5 percent of total capital.  Aggregate loans to all insiders will not exceed\n20 percent of capital.\n(v)  Loan  Loss  Reserve.  The  loan  loss  reserve  will  be  calculated  based  on  the\nclassification system: 1 percent for loans overdue by 1-30 days, 25 percent for\nthose overdue by 31-60 days, 50 percent against for those overdue by 61-120\ndays, and 100 percent against all loans overdue by more than 120 days.\n(vi)  Foreign Exchange. Net foreign currency exposure against the togrog will not be\ngreater than 20 percent of the bank\u2019s total capital.\n3.    General  Structures  and  Procedures.  Candidate  banks  should  have  satisfactory\nfinancial performance as confirmed by external audit of financial statement by independent\nauditors acceptable to ADB for the prior fiscal year and updated information of satisfactory\nfinancial performance for the preceding 12 months as confirmed by BOM through their ongoing\nsupervision.", "50 Appendix 7, page 2\n(i)  Portfolio Quality. The quality of a bank\u2019s existing loan portfolio will be one of the\nbest indicators of its ability to make good loans in the future.  Loan classification\npolicies and procedures will follow internationally accepted principles. A direct\nreview of a sample of the loan portfolio will also be made.  Changes in portfolio\nquality will be examined over a period of time to determine if the bank\u2019s lending\npractices are improving or getting worse.\n(ii)  Loan Loss Reserve Adequacy. The adequacy of the reserve will be measured\nagainst the standards established by BOM.\n(iii)  Audited Financial Statements. An external audit will be provided before a bank is\naccepted as a PCB.\n(iv)  Profitability. A participating bank will be profitable, preferably with a track record\nof earnings over at least the past three years.\n(v)  Asset-Liability Management. The bank\u2019s policies and procedures will be reviewed\nwith attention to interest rate and maturity gap management and limits and other\nasset and liability issues.\n(vi)  Corporate  Governance.  To  be  eligible,  a  bank  will  have  an  active  and\nexperienced  board  of  directors  (shareholder\u2019s  committee),  and  an  audit\ncommittee, to which the bank\u2019s internal audit function reports directly.\n(vii)  Management Information System. The bank will have sufficient management\ninformation systems to be able to monitor the overall quality of its loan portfolio\nregularly.\n(viii)  Size.  The  small  size  of  a  bank  will  not  automatically  exclude  it  from\nconsideration, although the prudential regulation governing the maximum loan to\nany one borrower might limit a small bank\u2019s ability to participate in the program in\na meaningful way.\n(ix)  Start-up Banks. Newly starting banks will not be eligible to participate.  At least\nthree years operating experience is required.\n4.    Credit Culture. A commercial bank must have strong credit culture to be a potential\ncandidate for the proposed Project.  Key factors to be considered are:\n(i)  Credit Policies and Procedure. The bank will have a written credit policy that has\nbeen  approved  by  its  board  of  directors  and  is  regularly  followed  by  its\nmanagement and employees. Portfolio quality should be reviewed regularly at\nboard meetings, and unusually large loans will be approved by the board.  Credit\nprocedures  will  cover  such  issues  as  loan  approval  procedures,  lending\nauthorities,  classification  procedures,  monitoring  requirements,  and  collection\nprocedures.\n(ii)  Organization Structure. A credit committee will approve new loans and monitor\noverall portfolio quality on an ongoing basis.  A loan review department will\nindependently verify the classification of the loans in the portfolio.  A loan workout\ndepartment will collect problem loans.\n(iii)  Staffing. An assessment will be made of the numbers of lending officers and their\nrelevant experience.  In case of deficiencies, the bank will have a program for\nhuman resource development and provide training to improve staff skills.\n(iv)  Management Quality. This assessment is very subjective but will be reflected in\nthe bank\u2019s performance against the criteria.  It will be supplemented by meetings\nwith all senior managers.\n(v)  Shareholder  Influence.  A  number  of  banks  in  Mongolia  are  owned,  at  least\npartially,  by  large,  state-owned  corporations  or  by  government  bodies.    An\nexamination will be made to determine that these shareholders do not unduly", "51 Appendix 7, page 3\ninfluence the decisions of management, except through the proper activities of\nthe board of directors.\n5.    Others. PCBs must have adequate staff (sufficient number and quality) for the prudent\nmanagement of project funds and a human resources development plan and the intention to\nengage in training provided under the Project. Further, PCBs must possess the capacity to\ncontribute at least 25 percent of each subloan throughout the project period. PCBs must also\npossess or be prepared to develop, under the Project, lending policies and guidelines (such as\nloan  appraisal  and  approval  authorities,  classification  procedures,  monitoring  requirements,\ncollection  procedures,  terms,  and  conditions)  that  are  approved  by  BOM  and  regularly\nsupervised and they need to appropriately reflect the on-lending terms and conditions agreed to\nin the subsidiary loan agreement with, as well as the terms and conditions for subborrowers.\n3.  Eligibility Criteria for Participating Commercial Banks\n6.    The Government, with the assistance of BOM, will supervise the PCBs on a quarterly\nbasis, to determine their continuing eligibility to participate under the credit line.  This continuing\neligibility will be based on the PCBs\u2019 compliance with the eligibility criteria outlined above, as\ndescribed in written status updates issued by BOM, and on their performance under the credit\nline, as defined by the following criteria;\n(i)  No more than 20 percent of a PCB's subloan portfolio will be nonperforming\nloans.\n(ii)  The PCB will have met the objectives of the Project and the minimum lending\ntargets in their respective subloan agreement as amended from time to time by\nthe PMU and approved by ADB.\n7.    If a PCB is not in compliance with the general eligibility criteria and with the ongoing\neligibility criteria, MOFE, through the PMU and with the prior approval of ADB, will determine\nwhether the PCB will (i) prepare and implement a plan of action with the objective to reach\ncompliance with the criteria, or (ii) be excluded from the Project. Any PCB that is not in\ncompliance for more than a quarter will be automatically excluded from the Project. If a PCB is\nexcluded from the Project, the PCB will pay back to the special project account all funds made\navailable through the Project.\nB.  Terms and Conditions for Relending\n8.    Currently, no satisfactory benchmark has been set to determine the rate of interest for\nrelending to the PCBs.1 Accordingly, to avoid disturbing the market interest rate structure, the\ninterest of loans from MOFE through the housing development fund (HDF) to PCBs will be\nbased on the PCBs marginal cost of funds. The difference between the relending rate to PCBs\nand the cost of funds to MOFE based on a formula that includes allowances for the cost of\nfunds,  administrative  costs,  exchange  rate  and  interest  rate  fluctuations,  and  inflation,  will\naccrue to the HDF.\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n1  Other institutions have experienced the same problem.

The potential subborrowers will be previous and new customers of the PCBs. They may\nbe  individual  households,  public  and/or  private  enterprises,  small-  and  medium-scale\ncontractors, and (in the later years of the Project) condominium associations.

For Part A, means testing2 will be used to check on the applicant\u2019s financial status.\nInformation sought will include (i) evidence of direct household income (salary slips) and indirect\nincome,  e.g.,  income  in  kind  from  rents,  property,  food  from  own  plot,  contributions  from\nfriends/relatives;  (ii)  existing  housing  conditions  (floorspace,  building  type,  amount  paid  for\nconstruction, any part rented or leased out); (iii) affordability, e.g., current share of household\nexpenditure on housing, impact of repayments on loan requested, amount of collateral to be\nmade available;  (iv) other commitments, e..g., loans from friends, shops; and (v) other factors,\ne.g., households headed by women or with dependents.  The PMU will be responsible for\nensuring that the above conditions are satisfied. In addition, the PMU through PCBs will be\nrequired to ensure that the subloans are used strictly for the purchasing or upgrading a house.\nThe maximum maturity of subloans is seven years. The PCBs will on-lend to intermediaries and\nindividual borrowers at their marginal cost of funds plus a spread to cover their loan processing\nexpenses, an adequate risk premium, and a reasonable margin.\n4.

The consulting services under the Project are in two categories: project implementation\nand capacity building.\nA.  Project Implementation (24 person-months)\n2.    The Project will be the first of its kind in Mongolia, the proceeds of which will initially fund\nthe Government\u2019s housing development fund. The housing finance and policy consultant, who\nwill be a long-term adviser to the project management unit (PMU), will ensure the successful\naccomplishment of the following tasks.\n(i)  As the major liaison between the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE),\nBank of Mongolia  (BOM), participating commercial banks (PCBs), participating\nlocal  governments  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  PMU  staff  will\nestablish close working relationships with designated project liaison officials in\nthese organizations.\n(ii)  Based on lending arrangements as specified in the project and loan agreements\nand the subsidiary loan agreements, PMU staff will work with MOFE, BOM, and\nthe PCBs to develop project-specific forms and procedures for the approval,\ndisbursement, repayment, and relending of project proceeds. These will include\nestablishing separate project accounts in BOM and the PCBs.\n(iii)  To ensure that the objectives of the Project are met, PMU staff will work closely\nwith MOFE, BOM, the PCBs, and lending intermediaries to assure that the loan\nparameters of lending to low- and middle-income groups are understood by all\nparties involved. To ensure that an adequate number of loans and loan amounts\nare made to low-income families, minimum lending targets will be included in the\nloan agreements and monitored by the PMU.\n(iv)  Although the PCBs will incur the full lending risk of loans made under the Project,\nPMU staff will review loan packages submitted to the PCBs to ensure that the\nfinal borrowers meet the project lending criteria as defined in the respective loan\nagreements.  PMU staff will carry out these reviews expeditiously avoid delays in\nProject implementation.\n(v)  Once project loans have been made by the PCBs to lending intermediaries and\nfinal borrowers, PMU staff will undertake periodic field visits to the relevant sites\nto ascertain proper end uses of the loans.\n(vi)  Working closely with PCBs, PMU staff will periodically review PCB accounts to\nensure that repayments under the Project are being on-lent to the same low- and\nmiddle-income groups.\n(vii)  Based on quarterly reports from BOM, PMU staff will ensure that the PCBs\nremain in compliance with BOM prudential norms as well as other relevant PCB\nselection criteria as specified in the project and loan agreements.", "58 Appendix 8, page 2\n(viii)  PMU staff will work closely with small - and medium-scale contractors to help\nthem apply for construction loans under the Project and to ensure that their\nprojects are affordable to low- and middle-income purchasers.\n(ix)  The consultants will work closely with the housing area action plan (HAAP) Unit\nof the Government Implementing Agency for Construction, Urban Development\nand Public Utilities (GIACUDPU) and participating local governments to help\nthem  develop  viable  HAAP  schemes  for  financing  under  the  Project.  Such\nschemes will be financed through long-term loans disbursed through the local\ngovernments\u2019 budgets.\n(x)  To ensure proper accounting for project funds by the Government auditor or an\nexternal auditor acceptable to ADB, PMU staff will arrange for annual audits of\nproject accounts (MOFE and BOM). PCBs will arrange for the their own external\naudits by international accounting firms acceptable to ADB.\n(xi)  PMU staff will coordinate and give overall supervision to the international  and\ndomestic  consultants  selected  to  carry  out  capacity  building  and  training\ntechnical assistance.\n(xii)  The  consultant  will  provide  developing  and  institutional  capacity  of  the\nGovernment to implement the Housing Law and related laws.\nB. Capacity Building and Training Consultant Services (17 person-months)\n3.    Given  the  lack  of  experience  in  housing  and  construction  finance  in  Mongolia,  a\nsignificant amount of institutional strengthening and training will be required to ensure the\nsuccessful implementation of the Project. A capacity building and training program in housing\nand construction finance for PCB staff, small- and medium-scale contractors, and concerned\nlocal government officials, will therefore be carried out by the consultants.\n1. Training for PCBs in Mortgage-Based Lending (3 person-months).\n4.    The  consultant  have  at  least  five  years  experience  in  designing  and  implementing\ntraining in the banking sector, including home mortgage operations. Experience in transitional\neconomies will be helpful.  Based upon the project implementation schedule and under the\noverall supervision of the PMU, the consultant will\n(i)  conduct a training needs analysis of the credit departments of the PCBs with\nrespect to the specific requirements of underwriting and servicing housing loans,\npaying particular attention to constant payment amortization, risk management,\nlending to individuals, income and asset verification, housing loan underwriting\nprincipals, collateral evaluation, monthly loan servicing procedures, and housing\nloan collections;\n(ii)  based on the training needs analysis, set priorities, formulate objectives, and\ndesign curricula and training programs for senior and middle management, and\nsupervisors and staff of PCB credit departments;\n(iii)  prepare a report to the PMU describing the proposed training programs, obtain\nPMU approval, and conduct the training programs for the specified PCBs;", "59 Appendix 8, page 3\n(iv)  based  on  an  evaluation  of  the  training  program,  prepare  and  conduct\nreinforcement programs where appropriate; and\n(v)  at the end of the assignment, prepare a final report for the PMU.\n2.  Training in General Credit Operations for PCBs (2 person-months)\n5.    The consultant should have at least five years experience in direct credit management\nand  implementing  training  in  the  banking  sector.  Based  upon  the  project  implementation\nschedule and under the overall supervision of the PMU, the consultant will\n(i)  conduct a training needs analysis of PCBs credit department, paying particular\nattention to general credit and risk management; credit department organization;\nand basic credit procedures including loan underwriting, credit analysis, loan\napplication processing, collateral evaluation, loan servicing and loan collections;\n(ii)  based on the training needs analysis, set priorities, formulate objectives, and\ndesign curricula and training programs for senior and middle management, and\nsupervisors and staff of the subspecialties within the credit department;\n(iii)  prepare  a  report  to  the  PMU  and  PCBs  senior  management  describing  the\nproposed training programs, obtain PMU and PCBs management approval, and\nconduct the training programs for the specified groups within PCBs;\n(iv)  evaluate  the  results  of  the  training  program  and  prepare  and  conduct\nreinforcement programs where appropriate; and\n(v)  at the end of the assignment, prepare a final report for the PMU.\n3.

Preliminary Review\n1.  To assess the suitability of commercial banks to participate in the proposed Project,\nrecent financial statements and operating data of 10 of the 12 commercial banks currently\noperating in Mongolia were reviewed. The review resulted in a shortlist of possible participating\ncommercial banks with potential to be involved in the Project.\nB. Analysis of Three Participating Commercial Banks\n2.  Based on a review of 10 commercial banks, the list of potential participants included\nthree  major  banks:  Golomt  Bank  (Golomt),  Mongol  Post  Bank  (MPB),  and  Trade  and\nDevelopment Bank of Mongolia (TDBM). Financial and operational information was assessed in\ndetail. Also, projections to 31 December 2003, including the effects of participation in the Project\non the banks\u2019 future financial positions, were undertaken.\n1. Golomt Bank\n3.    Golomt is the largest privately owned bank in Mongolia, with nine retail branches, 115\nemployees, and more than 22,600 depositors.  The bank is 100 percent owned by EBH Bodi\nFinance Service Co., Ltd. (EBH Bodi), a Portuguese-Mongolian joint venture holding company,\nwhich founded the bank in 1995.  Golomt has met the BOM requirement of MNT2.0 billion ($1.8\nmillion) in paid-in-capital.\n4.    Since 1997, Golomt has been in general compliance with BOM\u2019s prudential norms.\nGolomt\u2019s  1999  financial  statements  have  been  independently  audited  by  an  international\nauditing firm, with good results. The bank has been consistently profitable, and its loan loss\nreserve meets BOM\u2019s standards. It is properly structured, with an independent internal audit\nfunction and an audit committee that reports to the shareholders\u2019 committee. It also has a high-\nranking  asset  and  liability  committee,  which  is  responsible  for  setting  interest  rates  and\nmanaging the balance sheet structure. Golomt\u2019s ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans is\nwell within BOM\u2019s standard limit of 25 percent. Also, Golomt is receiving technical assistance\n(TA) for management information system (MIS) development under the World Bank\u2019s private\nsector development credit (PSDC). Golomt has contracted to have its MIS upgraded to Oracle\non Sun equipment, which will be a robust system when completed.\n5.    Golomt\u2019s written credit policy is currently being reviewed by attorneys. The bank has a\nproperly organized and staffed credit department, with specialized and trained credit analysts.\nGolomt is an active participant in the PSDC and has received credit-oriented TA in support of\nthat program. The bank will need to establish a housing loan department for the Project and will\nneed training focused on housing lending, lending to individuals, and collections management\nbefore it makes loans under the Project.\n6.    The projections reflect Golomt\u2019s aggressive approach to growth, with 25 percent average\nannual increases expected in deposits over the five years and 40 percent annual growth in\nlending.  Golomt\u2019s  organizational  capacity  to  participate  in  the  Project,  and  to  successfully\ngenerate, underwrite, process, and collect project loans is adequate. Organizationally, Golomt is\na relatively sound bank, and with Golomt\u2019s participation in the PSDC and the corresponding TA,\nhas strengthened its credit and MIS operations. As with all the PCBs, Golomt will need training", "63 Appendix 10, page 2\nrelated to housing finance issues, as well as to the issues surrounding lending to individuals.\n2. Mongol Post Bank\n7.    MPB was established in 1994 as a private bank with branches in all 21 provincial\ncapitals.  It also operates six subbranches in Ulaanbaatar to savings and bills.  Significantly\nsmaller in total assets than either Golomt or TDBM, MPB has a large customer base of 18,259\ndepositors, and it has been an active lender in the country\u2019s banking sector. Construction and\nindustrial lending account for about 40 percent of its business with lending for trade accounting\nfor about 30 percent.  MPB has recently been quite profitable, with 19.4 percent annualized\nreturn on equity through the first seven months of 2000. MPB is in general compliance with\nBOM\u2019s prudential norms. MPB underwent its first independent audit by an international audit\nfirm in early 2000, when Ernst & Young audited the 1999 books and issued an unqualified\nopinion.\n8.    Like other Mongolian banks, MPB does not make long-term loans, instead keeping all\nmaturities short.  Historically, many of MPB\u2019s loans have been written with six-month terms, and\nthen are rolled-over at maturity. By 31 October 2000, the bank had collected MNT469 million of\nthe MNT1.0 billion due, and an additional MNT348 million was received by 31 December,\nbringing the nonperforming loans to total loans ratio within BOM\u2019s prudential requirements.\n9.    MPB  is  scheduled  to  be  the  second  bank,  after  TDBM,  to  install  new  accounting\nsoftware. This is a major undertaking, with consequences for every department in the bank. The\nproject  management  unit  will  monitor  the  degree  of  disruption  to  MPB\u2019s  operations  and\ncoordinate project capacity building schedules with the progress of the MIS implementation.\nProfits in 2000 were strong at MNT135 million ($122,839) at 31 October. Profits for future years\ncould be significantly larger due to the additional MNT1.5 billion ($1.4 million) in cash available\nfrom the sale of common shares. The infusion of capital in 2000 and 2001 generated through\nthe  sale  of  common  stock  will  have  a  major  strengthening  effect  on  the  bank\u2019s  financial\nstatements, providing significant new funds for investment in loans and profit generation. The\nprojections anticipate an additional MNT1.0 billion ($909,918) increase in paid-in-capital in\n2002. The projections also show a moderate 14 percent annual growth in deposits, with a much\nlarger 27 percent annual growth in loans receivable, exclusive of project loans.  MPB\u2019s financial\nabsorptive capacity, after the sale of additional common stock in 2000 and early 2001, will be\nmore than adequate to support anticipated project loans.\n3. Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia\n10.    Licensed in 1991, TDBM is the dominant commercial bank in Mongolia, accounting for\napproximately 45 percent of the country\u2019s banking assets. The bank is primarily focused on\ncorporate customers, with a relatively small customer base of 9,636 depositors. The bank has\n300 employees and operates four branches in the eastern half of the country, three branches in\nUlaanbaatar.  The bank has been a major beneficiary of TA programs financed by ADB, Japan\nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW), and the World\nBank. The bank is well advanced in terms of organizational structure, staff training, modern\nbanking management practices, and formal business discipline. TDBM has been very profitable\nin recent years, earning more than 40 percent on equity. The bank is 70 percent owned by the\nGovernment with the remaining 30 percent held by employees. However, in March 2001, the\nParliament approved the plans for the privatization of TDBM which is progressing rapidly.\n11.    TDBM\u2019s financial ratios are in compliance with BOM\u2019s prudential norms. TDBM has", "64 Appendix 10, page 3\nundergone independent international audits since 1997, receiving clean opinions for each of the\nthree years.  Portfolio quality is undergoing correction and the bank has high quality corporate\ngovernance. This includes a formal asset and liability committee responsible for setting interest\nrates and lending capacities, an independent internal audit function, and an audit committee\nreporting to the shareholders\u2019 committee. TDBM has completed the installation of a new MIS\nsystem.\n12.    TDBM\u2019s banking operations have been extremely profitable in 1999 and 2000. TDBM\nhas met BOM\u2019s requirement to have MNT2.0 billion ($1.8 million) paid-in capital by 30 June\n2000.  TDBM has benefited from large amounts of TA over the past several years, much of it\nfocused on credit operations. TDBM has a well-defined and well-functioning credit department,\nand management is focused on risk management issues. TDBM has a written credit policy and\nwritten credit procedures. There is a credit committee staffed with senior managers and reviews\nand approves all loans. Interest rates and amounts of funds available for lending are established\nby an asset and liability committee. However, TDBM does not have experience with housing-\nrelated lending, nor does it have experience lending to individuals.\n13.    Financial projections for TDBM through 31 December 2003 reflect TDBM\u2019s conservative\napproach with projections of 7.5 percent per year compounded growth rate in deposits, and 22\npercent per year in loans receivable, exclusive of increases in externally-funded project loans.\nTDBM\u2019s managerial capacity and organizational capacity are strong. TDBM is a participant in\nboth the PSDC and the KfW small- and medium-enterprises programs. TDBM has more than\nadequate financial capacity to absorb its estimated share of project proceeds.", "65 Appendix 11, page 1\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\nA. Economic Rationale\n1.    The  economic  rationale  for  the  Project  is  to  strengthen  the  housing  and  urban\ndevelopment sector institutions that are key to addressing the poverty alleviation, health, and\nproductivity policy concerns of Mongolia. Part A of the Project focuses on the housing finance\nmarket and provides access to finance for lease of serviced land and for house construction or\npurchase and project finance to small and medium scale contractors. This will make private\ndemand for houses effective and enable organizations supplying housing to meet that demand.\n2.    Since supply of housing must be matched by supply of serviced land, parts A and B of\nthe Project undertake key interventions in support of a more efficient land development market,\nspecifically  improving  local  governments\u2019  ability  to  finance  and  provide  serviced  land  with\nsecurity of tenure in city expansion areas, particularly those occupied by the poor. Part C\nprovides capacity building for the institutions involved in parts A and B.\n3.    Part A seeks to strengthen existing financial institutions and broaden their scope of\nactivity by introducing mortgage or house upgrading. Financial institutions cannot currently\nprovide such finance for the majority of households, particularly the poor. The Project, adapting\ngood practice in housing microfinance as used in other countries, addresses this issue by using\nintermediary  organizations  to  originate  such  lending.  Part  C  of  the  Project  funds  capacity\nbuilding to set up the required loan administration systems within the participating commercial\nbanks  (PCBs)  and  intermediary  institutions.  The  introduction  of  new  lending  products  will\ncompliment the extensive support already given to the financial sector in Mongolia through the\ntwo financial sector program loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This support has\nsucceeded in establishing the viability of the PCBs as key agencies in project implementation.\n4.    Part B will enable local governments to provide infrastructure to the ger housing areas\nthat house the majority of the poor. The Project will help the Government demonstrate the\nviability of a new urban development process. First, part A activities will also foster a more\nefficient process of urban development in two ways. Some of the intermediary enterprises in\nPart  A  have  already  identified  and  secured  land  for  development,  thus  assisting  the  land\nconversion  processes.  Second,  part  A  will  provide  bridging  finance  for  contractors  and\ndevelopers and thus facilitate an effective supply response to demand. Part C of the Project will\nprovide capacity building for local governments to institutionalize this new approach to shelter\ndevelopment.\nB. Affordability and Willingness to Pay\n5.    The surveys determined whether there is a sound basis for each of the three key\nelements involved in satisfying the demand of the poor and low-income groups for housing. The\nsurveys covered (i) the potential for supplying and upgrading housing at prices affordable by the\npoor and low income groups; (ii) the demand for, and affordability of, finance for such housing\nand  upgrading  products;  and  (iii)  the  interest  of  intermediaries  in  initiating  loans  for  such\nproducts. In each case the surveys found that a solid demand base for the Project exists.\nRegarding the formal sector housing, small two-room apartments catering to low-income groups\ncan be constructed for $3,094 (MNT3.4 million). Given the lending terms envisaged, this unit\ncan be afforded at a household income of $182 (MNT200,000) per month, which is within the\ndefinition of \u201clow-income.\u201d", "66 Appendix 11, page 2\nC. Economic Analysis\n6.    Given  this  demand,  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  undertaken.  Detailed\neconomic internal rates of return (EIRR) analysis could not be undertaken for Part A of the\nProject since neither the precise location nor the final size, terms, or uses of the loans are\navailable. At this stage it is also impossible to know the total number of borrowers in each\nincome category and the relative number of loans that will be used for new construction, house\ncompletion, renovation, and upgrading. As an indication of benefits, however, a representative\nsubproject was selected to illustrate the economic benefits of Part B of the Project.\n7.   Following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and Framework for the\nEconomic Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects,  EIRR  were  calculated  for  a\nrepresentative HAAP subproject over a 14-year period to assess these components of the\nProject.\n1. Costs\n8.   For the representative HAAP subproject, annual recurrent operation and maintenance costs\nwere considered at a flat rate of 9 percent of the estimated average HAAP capital cost per\nannum,  based  on  previous  ADB-financed  projects  in  Mongolia.    Economic  costs  were\ndenominated in terms of the domestic prices and expressed in constant 2001 prices  using an\nexchange rate of MNT1,099/$1.  Tradable components were adjusted to economic prices using\na shadow exchange rate factor of 1.11 (the inverse of the standard conversion factor of 0.9) and\nnontraded components were valued at market prices.  Costs excluded estimated taxes and\nduties.\n2. Benefits\n9.   Benefits were denominated in domestic prices and expressed in constant 2001 prices.  The\nsubproject  is  based  on  the  HAAP  upgrading  scheme  for  1,100  households  in  Darkhan.\nAccording to surveys for the Project, installation of infrastructure would result in a substantial\nincrease in housing property values.  The differential between the current prices in the formal\nsector and comparably located ger housing area was used to calculate the benefits of upgrading\ninvestment. The prices of the formal sector lots compare well with capital cost estimates of the\nconsultants. The average level of services provided by Project investments will be little or no\ndifferent from the level of services provided in the formal sector housing areas. Conservatively,\na discount of 10 percent was applied to the estimated plot value in the upgrading areas. This\nresulted in a one-time estimated increase in plot value of at least $728 (MNT800,000). Table\nA11.1 shows the capital costs of the subproject and the stream of benefits. The benefit stream\nreflects a conservative estimate of plot completion. The resulting EIRR was 50.9 percent. While\nhigh, the result is sensitive to estimates of ultimate plot value (see below) although robust in\nother respects.\n3. Risks and Sensitivity Analysis\n10.    As this Project is breaking new ground for the implementing agencies, there is a real risk\nof (i) project cost overrun in capital and operational expenditures, (ii) benefit shortfall, and (iii)\ndelay. The sensitivity of the EIRRs to changes in variables reflecting these risks is presented in\nTable A11.2. The EIRR is most sensitive to changes in the benefit assumptions and least\nsensitive  to  changes  in  investment  costs.  The  switching  value  analysis  indicates  that  the\nbenefits would have to fall by 15 percent and the capital costs increase by 20 percent before the\nEIRR would reach the 12 percent threshold. A delay of one year in benefits causes the EIRR to", "67 Appendix 11, page 3\nfall to 16 percent. However, the Project is sensitive to individual plot value increases. The\nswitching value analysis indicates that plot values would have to fall by 16 percent before the\nEIRR reaches 12 percent, however the sensitivity indicator shows that this aspect is critical. The\nProject is robust in the face of varying maintenance costs.\n11.    Estimates of plot value increases are conservative because (i) high current values for\nunserviced plots are used; (ii) the increase was discounted to reflect potential lingering effects of\nthe stigma of an \u201cinformal\u201d area (although formal plots are no different in physical provision of\nservices). Thus, the quality of project implementation need to be carefully monitored as it may\nimpact  beneficiaries\u2019  willingness  to  pay.  The  Project  has  addressed  this  by  (i)  surveys\nundertaken as part of project formulation, which established the willingness to pay; (ii) careful\nassessment of the affordability of plot upgrading and design of cost recovery mechanisms\nappropriate to the subject communities; (iii) inclusion in part C of the Project, implementation\narrangements that will eliminate the \u201cinformality\u201d of the subject areas by integrating them into\nthe  formal  planning  and  service  systems  of  the  local  government;  and  (iv)  support  for\ncommunity groups, which will foster community cohesiveness and responsibility for service\nprovision, thereby maintaining the quality of upgrading areas. While of less concern, there is\nsome sensitivity to cost overruns. This implies that careful attention to cost control needs to be\nemphasized in Project implementation.\n4. Other Benefits\n12.    HAAP types of residential upgrading projects produce a number of benefits the value of\nwhich may not be fully reflected in the increase in land value and/or that cannot be monetised\nfor the economic analysis. These benefits include (i) employment benefits due to community\nparticipation in construction of infrastructure and services, for example labor amounting to $15.3\nmillion or some 32,000 person-years of employment at the average wage; (ii) home-based\nemployment facilitated by improved infrastructure and shelter conditions, estimated at $1.1\nmillion per year; (iii) health benefits resulting from improved water supply, sanitation, drainage,\nand solid waste management, amounting to approximately $100,000 per year; (iv) land tenure\nbenefits associated with the enhanced security of tenure; (v) increased productivity due to time\nsavings from improved water delivery (estimated at $280,000 per annum), less absenteeism,\nand greater access to education due to improved health and access to work and schools; and\n(vi) safety benefits and less property damage due to reduced flooding and fires.  These benefits\nfall  to  the  low  income  and  poor  groups  in  the  community  and  a  high  proportion  of  the\nbeneficiaries will be women (see Appendix 12).\nD. Overall Assessment and Sustainability\n13.    The Project is designed to have long-term benefits through improving the quality of life\nfor an ever-increasing number of people who need improved shelter and urban services. The\nestablishment of a sustainable housing finance system will open new markets for the banking\nsector and strengthen small- and medium-scale contractors to provide affordable housing to\nlow- and middle-income families.", "68 Appendix 11, page 4\n14.    Substantial progress has been made in providing the basis of an efficient housing and\nshelter sector in Mongolia.1 This is of economic importance given the significance of housing\nassets to the people of Mongolia, particularly the poor. The Project furthers this policy objective\nby several means. First, it will establish a revolving fund, the housing development fund (HDF),\nat Bank of Mongolia and Ministry of Finance and Economy. This fund will catalyze PCBs to lend\ntheir own funds, the prerequisite of a sustainable, locally funded housing finance system. Also,\nthe difference between the relending rate to PCBs and the cost of funds to the HDF will accrue\nto the HDF, enhancing its resources over time. Second, part C of the Project will significantly\nstrengthen the PCBs to undertake mortgage-based lending so that direct lending to individuals\ncould be started by year three. Until the capacity of the PCBs is sufficiently built, lending will be\nmainly  to  private  and  public  enterprises  for  on-lending  to  their  employees.  Third,  the\ncomprehensive policy dialogue agenda under the Project focuses on establishing appropriate\nand  sustainable  mechanisms  for  housing  finance.  Fourth,  lending  at  market  rates  through\nPCBs,  which  are  the  only  institutions  with  experience  in  loan  origination  and  recovery\nprocedures, represents the best mechanism for building a sustainable housing finance system.\nFinally, making the passage of the new land law a condition for loan disbursement to individuals\nwill strengthen sustainability of the Project. The required legislation has already been introduced\nto Parliament.\n15.    To ensure progress in these areas, several measures have been included in the design\nof part A of the Project. On-lending arrangements have been structured to provide the PCBs\nwith sufficient spreads to cover their operational costs and risk premiums and provide an\nadequate margin. Semiannual reviews of on-lending and relending rates have been provided to\navoid asset-liability mismatches, especially if inflation increases during the Project period or\nexchange rate levels decline precipitously. Upon completion of project implementation, the\noriginal and future PCBs will be making housing loans primarily with their own resources. In\naddition, the establishment of a substantial revolving fund at the HDF could provide the basis of\na wholesale housing finance institution lending on the basis of, or securitizing, PCBs\u2019 primary\nloans, rather than relending directly to them.\n16.    Similarly for part B of the Project, the range of benefits to households and enterprises\nflowing  from  improved  quality  of  life  and  infrastructure  is  very  significant  in  the  current\ncircumstances  of  Mongolia.  This  significance  is  reinforced  because  the  benefits  will  fall\nsubstantially  to  poor  households.  The  Project  will  establish  an  institutional  framework  for\ncontinuing improvement in quality of life and infrastructure provision. Specifically (i) the HDF will\ncontinue to make loans to local governments for new sites and upgrading HAAPs based on\nlessons learned in the implementation of previous HAAP subprojects, (ii) HAAP subprojects will\nbe  integrated  into  new  master  plans  for  Mongolian  cities,  (iii)  cost  recovery  under  HAAP\nsubprojects will create sustainable revolving funds in participating cities and instill an ethic of\npaying for urban services, and (iv) central and local government support to the Project approach\nwill be firmly established.\n                  \n1 Establishing a full market-based sustainable housing finance system in Mongolia will take some time. The Housing\nLaw, National Housing Strategy and Housing Privatization Law and condominium associations amendments\npassed in 1999 have established a market-oriented legal and policy framework in the Mongolian housing sector.\nSafeguards against defaulters are provided by the recent amendments to the Civil Code with respect to use of\nimmovable property as collateral and granting authority to banks to possess the collateralized property from\nborrowers failing to repay the loan.", "69 Appendix 11, page 5\nTable A11.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return\n(MNT \u2018000)\nYear Capital Cost Maintenance Cost Increase in Plot Net Benefits\nValues\n2002 (95,998) (95,998)\n2003 (335,997) 288,000 (47,997)\n2004 (48,000) (15,105) 288,000 224,895\n2005 (15,105) 144,000 128,895\n2006 (15,105) (15,105)\n2007 (15,105) (15,105)\n2008 (15,105) (15,105)\n2009 (15,105) (15,105)\n2010 (15,105) (15,105)\n2011 (15,105) (15,105)\n2012 (15,105) (15,105)\n2013 (15,105) (15,105)\n2014 (15,105) (15,105)\n2015 (15,105) (15,105)\nEIRR = 50.9%\nTable A11.2: Sensitivity Analysis\nVariable EIRR Sensitivity Switching\n(percent) Indicator Value\nBase Case 50.9\nBenefits decrease by 10% 24.0 8.2 12.0\nCapital costs increase by 10% 30.0 6.1 17.0\nOperating costs increase by 10% 50.0 1.2 90.0\nOne year construction delay 14.0", "70 Appendix 12, page 1\nPOVERTY IMPACT ANALYSIS\nA. Introduction\n1.    To  address  poverty,  the  Government  of  Mongolia  began  implementing  the\ncomprehensive, six-year, multisectoral National Poverty Alleviation Program (NPAP) in March\n1996. The main goal of the NPAP was to reverse the trends of increasing human deprivation\nand to reduce, within the six-year period, the number of the poor to less than 10 percent of the\npopulation. The NPAP adopted an integrated approach to poverty reduction that entails not only\nincome generation but also improved access to basic social services and promotion of human\ndevelopment. Recently, the Government approved the Household Livelihood Capacity Support\nProgram, which will serve as the next stage of the NPAP. This program envisages a complex\nset of initiatives aimed at improving the livelihood, income, skills, education and health of those\nliving below the poverty line.\n2.    The  overall  responsibility  for  the  NPAP  lies  with  the  National  Poverty  Alleviation\nCommittee. The Poverty Alleviation Program Office is responsible for managing the program,\nassisted  by  local-level  Poverty  Alleviation  Councils  comprised  of  local  governments  and\nnongovernment organizations. A Poverty Partnership Agreement (PPA) was signed between\nthe Government of Mongolia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), on 24 March 2000.  The\nPPA endorses the analysis and focus of the country\u2019s operational strategy; formalizes the\npartnership, with the Government setting out a long-term vision; and agrees upon targets for\npoverty reduction.  The PPA provides for an annual review of performance, highlighting key\nindicators and institutional milestones necessary to monitor progress.  The Government has\nconfirmed that the PPA will continue to be fully respected as the basic framework for its poverty\nreduction efforts. The first annual review of the PPA was successfully completed 30 April 2001.\nThe review concluded that (i) ADB should adopt a more balanced approach in addressing urban\nand rural poverty; and (ii) infrastructure should be given increased focus.\n3.    The healthy development of the housing sector is one of the important means to reduce\npoverty in Mongolia. The new housing privatization law has the central objective of creating\nconditions whereby citizens can provide themselves with adequate housing that meets health\nand safety requirements. Given that ger housing areas account for nearly half of the urban\nhousing stock and are home to the largest proportion of the urban poor, their development into\n\u201ccomfortable housing areas\u201d is a key priority of the national housing policy.\n4.    The  Project  will  contribute  significantly  to  the  objectives  of  the  new  ADB  Country\nOperational Strategy for Mongolia by (i) establishing a sustainable market-based system for the\ndelivery of housing finance for low- and middle-income households; (ii) creating short-term\nemployment opportunities for the poor; (iii) improving urban infrastructure in ger areas; and (iv)\npromoting linkages among the financial sector, the housing sector, urban development, and\nemployment generation.\nB. Impact of the Project on the Poor\n5.    The  Project  will  benefit  about  125,000  people  in  the  project  area.  The  increased\ninvestment in the housing construction sector will generate significant employment opportunities\nin the ger housing areas. The improved housing will increase household income from home-\nbased income generation activities. The provision and upgrading of basic infrastructure in ger\nhousing areas will directly benefit the poor.", "71 Appendix 12, page 2\n1. Employment and Income Generation Benefits\n6.       The Project will generate significant employment opportunities for construction-related\nwork. Under part A, an estimated 60 percent of $15 million will be spent on construction-related\nlabor. Given the average annual salary of $480 equivalent (MNT527,520) per person for this\ntype of work, an expected 18,800 person-years of employment will be created from part A, of\nwhich 7,600 person-years will involve paid wages1 and 11,200 person-years will involve unpaid\nwages when construction labor costs are taken into account for households that build their own\nhouses.2 For part B, about 70 percent of the $7.5 million project investment will be used for paid\nlabor, which amounts to 11,700 person-years of employment.3 In addition, for construction-\nrelated activities, the procurement of mainly locally produced construction materials will be\nrequired including cement, reinforcing steel bars, pipes, logs, bricks, sand, gravel, doors, and\nwindows. In view of the fact that US$6,634 (MNT7.3 million) will be needed for an average\nperson-year of work,4 900 person-years and 360 person-years of employment will be generated\nfrom the US$6 million and US$2.4 million for local procurement related respectively to parts A\nand B. The number of person-years of employment to be created by various activities of parts A\nand B are presented in Table A12.1.\nTable A12.1: Estimated Direct Employment Created by the Project\n(person-years)\nItem Part A Part B\nWages 7,600 11,700\nUnpaid Labor 11,200 0\nFabrication of Construction Materials 900 360\nTotal 19,700 12,060\n7.    Using the average yearly wage of $480 (MNT527,520) for a construction worker, the\ndirect economic value of about 32,000 person-years of employment is equivalent to about $15.3\nmillion (MNT16.9 billion).\n2. Increased Home-Based Business Activities and Income\n8.    Improved  housing  and  enlarged  living space  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  reducing\npoverty by helping to increase household income and productivity through home-based work.\nAccording to the household survey, 55 percent of the beneficiary households have expressed\nthe desire to purchase or build a house, while 45 percent are interested in buying an apartment.\nThe survey also revealed that in the ger housing areas of Ulaanbaatar, 29 percent of the\nbeneficiary households who want to build or buy a house intend to use part of it to run a home-\nbased business.5 They expect to generate an average of $96 (MNT105,000) per month per\nhousehold. Similarly, 15 percent of the beneficiary households who want to buy an apartment\nplan to use part of their apartment for running commercial activities. They predict a monthly\n                  \n1 Based on the household survey, 40 percent of households prefer commercial and public housing.\n2 Based on the household survey, 60 percent of households will construct their own houses.\n3 The total investment for part B is $7.5 million, of which 70 percent  will be used for labor.\n4 Estimated by the project preparatory technical assistance consultants.\n5 According to the household survey, the types of home-based businesses, that the beneficiary households are\ninterested in pursuing include retail stores, repair shops, hairdressing, and beauty salons.", "72 Appendix 12, page 3\nincome of $221 (MNT242,879) per household on average from the businesses.6 Thus, the total\nbusiness income for the beneficiary population as a whole would amount to approximately\n$275,100.  Assuming  that  one  third  of  the  business  income  is  attributable  to  better  space\nutilization, the total yearly income from the ownership of houses and apartments is estimated at\n$1.1 million (MNT1.21 billion) per year. Assuming equal distribution of the business benefits\namong the beneficiary population, 40 percent or $440,200 will accrue to the low-income group\nannually.\n3. Health Benefits\n9.    According to the Zuunmod City health officer, poor housing conditions and poor quality\nof  water  supply,  drainage,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  removal  are  the  primary  causes  of\nhepatitis A, respiratory, digestive, genito-urinary, and skin diseases in Mongolia. The improved\nhousing and related infrastructure and services developed by the Project can lead to better\nwater supply, sanitation, drainage, and waste collection, which would reduce the mortality and\nmorbidity rates due to these diseases among the beneficiaries, particularly the poor, who are\nmore vulnerable to disease and have less money for treatment. The economic benefits in\nconjunction with the reduction in health problems will in turn result in savings in terms of fewer\ndays of absence from work, less loss of school days, reduced medical costs, and decreased\nhuman suffering.\n10.    The incidence of housing and sanitation-related diseases in Mongolia stands at 1,643\npersons per 10,000.7 An average of 14 days of hospitalization is required for the treatment of\neach  illness.  The  average  cost  of  hospitalization  (including  drugs)  is  approximately  $2.64\n(MNT2,901) per day.8 Assuming that the improvement could result in a 50 percent reduction of\nmorbidity,9 the savings in medical costs for the beneficiary population as a whole would be\naround $95,860 (MNT105.35 million) per year, while the savings in foregone income associated\nwith absence from work would be some $67,200 (MNT73.8 million) per year. Assuming an\nequal distribution of the benefits among the beneficiary population of 31,570, the poor will derive\nan annual savings of $69,810 (MNT76.7 million) or $5.16 (MNT5,670) per person per year from\nsavings in medical costs and foregone income.10 The fact that women bear disproportionate\nhousehold responsibilities for cooking, laundering, fetching water, and cleaning implies higher\ngains for them from improvements in housing conditions and related infrastructure and services.\nChildren, who are more susceptible to infectious diseases, will also benefit.11\n4. Increased Property Value\n11.    According  to  the  household  survey,  inadequate  garbage  collection,  unreliable  and\ninsufficient water supply, and the danger of flooding are the three primary concerns of local ger\n                  \n6 About 7 percent of the households are using part of their house for running a business including retail stores (64\npercent), repair shops (18 percent), and others (18 percent). Their average income from the home-based business\nis $363 (MNT394,000) per month. In the calculations here, the expected incomes of $97 per month for prospective\nhouse owners and $221 per month for prospective apartment owners are considered realistic.\n7 1996 data, from Human Development Report in Mongolia 1997. Such diseases include respiratory (827.2 per\n10,000), digestive (399.3 per 10,000), genito-urinary (284.9 per 10,000), skin  (96.1 per 10,000), and hepatitis A\n(35.2 per 10,000).\n8 Provided by the health officer of the Zuunmod City government.\n9 Based on estimates by Health Officer of the Zuunmod City government.\n10 Due to the lack of information, the foregone income caused by mortality and human suffering are not included.\n11According to Human Development Report in Mongolia 2000, the major causes of mortality and morbidity for infants\nand children under five years of age are respiratory infections and diarrhea.", "73 Appendix 12, page 4\nhousing area residents.12 Part B of the Project aims to improve urban infrastructure and related\nservices in substandard housing areas, which will lead to an increase in property values in the\nbeneficiary areas.\n5. Labor and Cost Savings\n12.    Piped water to water kiosks will be provided to 7,000 households under part B of the\nProject. One obvious benefit of the improvement will be labor savings in obtaining water for\nthese families.\n13.    Each ger area family currently spends an average of 1.5 hours daily13 to get water from\nkiosks serviced by water trucks. Water trucks deliver water only five days a week, which\nrequires families to travel even farther for water on the two other days. The effort requires an\nadditional four hours of travel time per week to obtain water simply to meet basic household\nneeds.14 Providing piped water to kiosks under the Project will ensure the availability of water on\na daily basis and eliminate the need for the additional four hours per family per week. The\nsavings in time on an annual basis would amount to one person-month for each of the 7,000\nfamilies. Assuming that the amount of time saved is used for productive purposes, the resulting\none person-month of saved labor could generate an average earning of $40 (MNT43,960) per\nfamily,15 including the poor.\n14.    The supply of piped water can also reduce the price of water by half from MNT1.2 to\nMNT0.6 per liter.16 The average monthly household cost of water in the surveyed ger housing\nareas was approximately $2.35 (MNT2,583).17  Households above and under the poverty line\nspend approximately the same amount on water. Based on this low level of consumption, a poor\nfamily could save $14 (MNT15,386) per year on water costs.\n15.    It is worth mentioning that, from a poverty reduction perspective, the two components of\nthe Project (parts A and B) are mutually supportive and highly complementary. Part B will\ngenerate the necessary construction-related employment opportunities and income for the poor,\nwho will then be able to afford to obtain a loan through part A to improve their housing.\n                  \n12According to the household survey, 41.8 percent of the respondents mentioned the lack of garbage collection and\ndisposal as their primary concern; 28.2 percent, unreliable/insufficient water supply; 20.0 percent, danger of\nflooding; 2.9 percent, unreliable electricity; 1.2 percent, difficult access to house; and 5.9 percent, other factors.\n13 Interviews with representatives from the cities of Zuunmod and Darkhan.\n14 Interview with a community leader in Bag 5 of Zuunmod City.\n15 The average annual earning for an unskilled laborer in Mongolia is $480.
