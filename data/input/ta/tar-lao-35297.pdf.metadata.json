During the 2003 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) confirmed its request for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare the Participatory Livestock Development Project, based on \nADB\u2019s livestock sector review in 2002.1  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2003 TA program for the \nLao PDR. The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited the Lao PDR in September 2003 and held \ndiscussions with stakeholders, including officials of relevant government agencies, external \nfunding  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  potential  beneficiaries.  The \nMission  reached  an  agreement  with  the  Government  on  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  and \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Agriculture accounts for approximately 52% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the Lao \nPDR with livestock and fisheries contributing 18%. More than 80% of the population depends on \nagriculture and forestry sector for its livelihood, with most people practicing subsistence farming. \nOver 95% of livestock is produced by smallholders. Livestock is integral to farming systems and \nthe sole means of rural people to accumulate assets, earn cash income, and provide draft \npower as well as manure for crops. Sales of cattle, buffalo, pigs, and chickens typically account \nfor  about  50%  of  annual  cash  income  in  sloping  lands.  ADB\u2019s  2001  participatory  poverty \nassessment (PPA) confirmed the significance of livestock, particularly for the rural poor.2 They \nconsider livestock an asset and safety net, to be sold when necessary. Similarly, many PPAs \nconcluded that poor Lao farmers clearly see livestock as a means to improve their livelihood \nand escape poverty. \n \n3.  The opportunities to improve the livelihood of the poor by strengthening their livestock \nproduction are, therefore, substantial. The Government\u2019s social development strategies place \nlivestock  development  at  the  center  of  their  poverty  reduction  thrusts.3  Livestock  sector \ndevelopment assistance is consistent with the principles of the country strategy and program to \npromote  rural  development  by  enhancing  income  generating  activities,  and  of  the  poverty \nreduction partnership agreement between the Lao PDR and ADB, which includes cooperation in \nimproving agriculture productivity through, among other means, livestock development. \n \n4.  The greatest constraint on livestock production is the high animal mortality rate due to a \nhigh incidence of animal diseases, poor nutrition, and low-input management and husbandry \npractices. More than 80% of chickens die every year in upland villages, sporadic disease \nepidemics frequently kill most pigs, and the mortality rate of buffalo calves due to internal \nparasites is 30\u201340%. Vaccination programs based on cold-chain-dependent vaccines have not \nreduced livestock mortality because of the difficulty in providing effective and consistent vaccine \ncoverage in remote areas. However, simple and affordable technologies to improve animal \nhealth and management are available, and adoption of a combination of these technologies at \nthe farm level could significantly reduce mortality rates and improve livestock productivity. Some \nof  the  technologies  have  already  been  introduced  to  farmers  in  northern  provinces  in  a \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 7 October 2003.  \n2  ADB. 2001. Participatory Poverty Assessment. Manila. The PPA found that loss of livestock is one of the main \ncauses of poverty, with 70% of those interviewed identifying livestock disease as a major problem. The poor in the \nnorthern region identified curing livestock disease as their first priority. \n3 The Government\u2019s Socioeconomic Development Plan for 2001\u20132005 emphasizes the significance of livestock \ndevelopment particularly in the northern region as a strategic poverty reduction measure. The Lao PDR\u2019s National \nPoverty Eradication Program (NPEP) recognizes livestock diseases and productivity as priority issues for the poor. ", "2  \nparticipatory livestock extension project, and have significantly improved farmers\u2019 income and \nlivelihood by reducing mortality and improving livestock productivity.4  \n \n5.  The key to effective introduction and sustainable adoption of such livestock production \ntechnologies is clear understanding by farmers of prevalent diseases and improved feeding and \nmanagement  practices  needed  to  combat  these  diseases.  The  development  of  feasible \ntechnical  options  that  address  farmers\u2019  priorities,  and  a  participatory  extension  system \nresponsive to farmers\u2019 needs is critical to enhance the knowledge of farmers and win their trust \nso that they try new technologies. For sustainable impacts, farmers need information about all \nfeasible options and must be allowed to make an informed decision to adopt innovations that \nbest  suit  their  farming  systems.  Such  participatory  extension  systems  will  involve  farmer \ntraining, diagnosis of animal problems, planning of optional measures, and follow-up monitoring \nand support in partnership with farmers. The support of the National Animal Health Center \nlinked to such extension system is also critical for effective animal disease diagnosis and \nevaluation of control measures. Other lessons learned from past government and externally \nfunded livestock programs underscore the significance of (i) integrated sets of interventions to \nimprove animal health, (ii) a gradual approach to disseminate new technologies with substantial \ncapacity  building  support  at  the  field  level  for  their  successful  adoption,  (iii)  marketing \ndevelopment and information support, and (iv) development of private service providers in \nessential  areas  of  livestock  production  and  trading  for  sustainable  and  effective  livestock \ndevelopment.  \n \n6.  Any interventions to improve livestock production in the country need to be balanced \nwith  the  measures  to  develop  livestock  business  opportunities  in  the  region.  Livestock \ndevelopment is one of the few rural income-generating sources that has immediate growth \npotential. Strong demand growth for meat domestically and in Thailand offers considerable \nmarket opportunities to absorb incremental production of cattle, buffalo, and goats. Sloping land \nin the Lao PDR has a comparative advantage over neighboring countries in large-ruminant \nproduction. However, as growth of pig and poultry production for export is constrained by feed \ncosts higher than in other countries in the region, the foreseeable market for pigs and poultry is \nonly  domestic.  More  studies  on  marketing  chains  for livestock  trade  in  the  Lao  PDR  and \nneighboring countries are required to identify constraints on livestock business development as \nwell as emerging livestock business opportunities for Lao smallholders. To specify requirements \nfor livestock export growth, product specifications imposed by existing and future customs and \nquarantine procedures at the border areas of Thailand, People\u2019s Republic of China, and Viet \nNam need to be studied. Other physical and financial constraints on livestock marketing, such \nas lack of supporting infrastructures and access to credit and other financing sources, also need \nto be analyzed.  \n \n7.  The TA and project will seek to ensure that the policy and regulatory environment \nencourages improvement of the livestock production system, favors development of private \nlivestock  entrepreneurs,  and  improves  access  to  markets  for  smallholders  by  eliminating \nconstraints  and  reducing  transaction  costs.  The  main  policy  and  regulatory  constraints  on  \nlivestock production and trading are found in local government\u2019s applications and interpretations \nof policies and regulations. Provincial governments reportedly place ceilings on meat prices, \nestablish quotas to restrict animal movements across provincial borders, and limit issuance of \n                                                 \n4  The  Forages  and  Livestock  Systems  Project  of  A$3  million  funded  by  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (AusAID), managed by International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), and implemented by \nNational Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI), Department of Livestock and Fisheries (DLF), and \nNational Agriculture and Forestry Extension Service (NAFES) (July 2000\u2013June 2005). ", "    3\nanimal-trading  licenses.  Unnecessarily  strict  trade  control  with  excessive  border  trade \nregulations and inefficient customs procedures seem to have caused avoidance of formal trade \nchannels,  which  resulted  in  substantial  volume  of  informal  trading.  The  TA  will  help  the \nGovernment (i) remove such policy and regulatory constraints to restore business incentives \nand the confidence of farmers and private entrepreneurs in the livestock sector; and (ii) promote \ndevelopment  of  private  businesses  in  the  essential  service  areas  required  for  livestock \nimprovement,  including  veterinary  services,  retail  and  wholesale  supply  of  chemicals  and \nantibiotics,  and  trading  of  live  animals,  to  create  a  sustainable  livestock  development \nenvironment.5 The TA will also identify land-tenure issues constraining livestock development in \nthe project area and identify ways to address them and enable sustainable and viable livestock \ndevelopment.  \n \n8.  Potential disparities in distribution of economic opportunities, which may occur due to the \nexisting variations in farm-resource use within a community and among ethnic groups, will be \ncarefully examined, and the project design will maximize project benefits distributed to socially \nvulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities and women. Poor households typically have only a \nfew chickens, ducks, and pigs for home consumption, and sell the surplus at local markets. \nWomen often tend small livestock. Improving these animals\u2019 survival and productivity is likely to \nimprove the household\u2019s nutrition and increase cash income from sales, providing a stepping-\nstone to building capital.  Better feed technologies will also save women\u2019s labor and ensure \nbetter livestock production and environmental protection by reducing indiscriminate grazing. The \ninitial social assessment is in Appendix 1. \n \n9.  As the livestock sector has promising growth potential and plays an important role in \nimproving  the  rural  poor\u2019s  income  and  livelihood,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  (i)  provide  the \nGovernment with a viable means to reduce rural poverty, and (ii) create a favorable environment \nfor private investments by removing major technical and regulatory impediments in the sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The objective of the TA is to help the Government prepare a project investment proposal \nto address major constraints in the livestock sector. The project aims to improve the income and \nlivelihood  of  about  21,000  farming  families6  by  introducing  animal  health  and  productivity \nenhancement technologies, improving marketing opportunities and the regulatory environment, \nand encouraging the development of private livestock service providers. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  To  achieve  its  objective,  the  TA  will  (i)  review  the  livestock  production  systems, \ninstitutions, human resources, marketing, regulations, policies, financing, and fiscal expenditure \n                                                 \n5 Private entrepreneurs engaged in trading, fattening, and processing of livestock are the major livestock buyers in \nthe Lao PDR.  They could become essential input suppliers and veterinary service providers for rural smallholders \nas these services would also benefit them by ensuring supply of better quality livestock for their business. As it \npromotes private service provider development, the Government is expected to play an essential role in (i) \nreducing transaction costs by eliminating regulatory constraints, and (ii) controlling the quality of such private \nservices through licensing and inspections. \n6 The project will be implemented in about 20 of 33 poor northern districts, and is expected to cover 36 villages in \neach district. The project coverage accounts for 32% of the total poor villages identified by the NPEP.  The average \nnumber of households in a villages is assumed to be 100, and 30% of the village population is expected to benefit \nfrom the project. \n ", "4  \nrelated to livestock development; (ii) develop feasible technical interventions and modalities for \na participatory extension system that will reduce mortality and improve productivity of livestock; \n(iii)  identify  critical  factors  constraining  market  development  and  emerging  business \nopportunities in the livestock sector; (iv) compile and evaluate detailed inventories of physical \nand human resources for livestock research, extension, marketing, and education; (v) evaluate \npast and ongoing external assistance for  livestock development and identify lessons learned; \n(vi) examine alternative means and options to promote private livestock services providers; (vii) \nprepare detailed investment proposals suitable for possible ADB financing; and (viii) carry out \ninstitutional,  environmental,  social,  financial  affordability,  economic,  and  estimated  cost \nassessments  for  the  investment  proposals,  and  identify  measures  to  prevent  or  mitigate \npossible risks associated with the proposals.7 The outline terms of reference for consultants are \nin Appendix 2. In developing a participatory extension system, the TA will conduct participatory \ndiagnosis  and  design  assignments  with  enthusiastic  farmers  in  the  selected  districts.  The \nexpected TA outputs include (i) diagnoses of major diseases in the project area, (ii) capacity-\nbuilding training for relevant government staff, (iii) production of extension materials suitable for \nthe  project  area  for  animal  health  improvement  and  disease  control  measures,  and  (iv) \nrecommendation of participatory extension modalities suitable for local conditions.  \n \n12.  In line with the regional proposal of progressive zoning for transboundary animal disease \ncontrol, the project area will consist of poor districts identified by the NPEP within the northern \ncontrol  and  buffer  zones.8  About  20  project  districts  will  be  selected  during  TA  inception \naccording to selection criteria, including (i) poor districts identified by NPEP, (ii) implementation \ncapacity of districts, (iii) the degree of ownership and willingness of district government,9 (iv) \nabsence of competing livestock development investment10 and potential synergy effects with \nother ADB assistance, and (v) market access.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total TA cost is estimated at $1.075 million equivalent, comprising  $650,000 in \nforeign exchange and $425,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance $900,000, \nincluding $650,000 in foreign exchange and $250,000 in local currency costs, on a grant basis \nfrom the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance \nthe balance of about $175,000 equivalent in local currency costs to cover counterpart staff \nsupport, office accommodation, facilities for seminars and meetings, and local transport costs. \nDetails of cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been \nadvised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Department of Livestock and Fisheries of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry \nwill be the TA Executing Agency and provide all required office space and support. A project \npreparation unit, headed by a full-time and well-qualified project director, will be established in \nthe department to supervise day-to-day TA activities in close coordination with the National \n                                                 \n7  The proposed project is classified as an environment category B. \n8  The control zone covers Houaphanh, Luang Prabang, Oudomxay, Phongsaly, and Xayaboury provinces; and the \nbuffer zone covers Luang Namtha, Bokeo, and Xieng Khouang provinces. \n9  At least one full-time staff needs to be assigned for the TA in each district, and six full-time staff for the ensuing \nloan project. \n10 Areas with substantial investment in livestock activities, such as Oudomxay, supported by an International Fund for \nAgricultural Development (IFAD) project, and districts assisted by a European Union livestock project, will not be \nconsidered for the project unless the activities are clearly complementary.  ", "    5\nAgriculture and Forestry Extension Services (NAFES) for livestock extension issues, and the \nNational Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI) for livestock technical issues. A \nproject steering committee headed by the vice minister of agriculture and forestry will be set up \nfor  (i)  overall  policy  direction  and  guidance,  (ii)  coordination  within  the  Government,  (iii) \nresolution of outstanding TA implementation issues, and (iv) comments on major consultant \noutputs. In the project provinces and districts, a full-time staff in each provincial agriculture and \nforestry service office and a full-time staff in each district agriculture and forestry service office \nwill be appointed to participate in TA activities.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented in 9 months, commencing in March 2004, and require a total \nof 69 person-months of consulting services: 32 person-months international and 37 person-\nmonths domestic. As development of animal health and production improvement technologies \nand institutional design to disseminate these technologies require highly specialized technical \nexpertise, the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and International Livestock \nResearch  Institute  (ILRI)  will  undertake  together  the  relevant  TA  tasks  to  ensure  quality \noutputs.11  For  TA  tasks  outside  the  organizations\u2019  expertise,  including  marketing,  social \ndevelopment,  financial  and  economic  analysis,  and  environmental  analysis,  individual \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The \ninternational institutional development specialist/ team leader from CIAT-ILRI will manage the \nconsultant team and finalize the TA outputs together with the domestic deputy team leader. \nCIAT-ILRI will submit a simplified technical proposal to recommend a work program, approach, \nand methodology, and personnel schedule of TA implementation. The consultants\u2019 input and an \nindicative TA implementation schedule are in Appendix 4. \n \n16.  Project  preparation  under  the  TA  will  apply  a  participatory  diagnosis  and  design \napproach  involving  all  major  stakeholders.  At  least  three  stakeholder  workshops  will  be \norganized to discuss the draft project proposal at the inception, interim, and draft final stages. \nAll equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  preparing  the  Participatory \nLivestock Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n11 CIAT and ILRI are willing to work together to implement the TA assignments. CIAT will be the focal point.  The \nassociation of CIAT and ILRI has prepared investment project proposals for the AusAID\u2019s Forages and Livestock \nSystems Project in the Lao PDR and the Enhancing Beef Productivity, Quality, Safety and Trade in Central \nAmerica Project. CIAT and ILRI are the only institutions in the Lao PDR that have the research competency and \nfield experience to improve animal health and control disease. Both institutions have a good track record in \ndelivering quality outputs for several ADB-supported programs, particularly the Review of the Livestock Sector in \nLao PDR (ADB. 2002. Review of the Livestock Sector in Lao PDR. Manila.) that served as an essential \nbackground analysis required for the TA formulation. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a national priority             Sector identified as a national priority in  \nin country poverty analysis?                    Yes        country poverty partnership agreement?               Yes              \n \nThe project, which will be prepared through the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA), is in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s Socioeconomic Development Plan (2001\u20132005). The plan emphasizes the significance of livestock \ndevelopment, particularly in the north, as a strategic poverty reduction measure.  The project will also support the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) National Poverty Eradication Program (NPEP).  It focuses on four key \nsectors, including agriculture, and emphasizes community driven and access-oriented rural development, together \nwith macroeconomic stabilization, public management, private sector development, and foreign investment. NPEP \nrecognizes livestock diseases and productivity as a priority issue for the poor.  The poverty reduction partnership \nagreement between the Lao PDR and Asian Development Bank (ADB) includes cooperation in improving agriculture \nproductivity, through, among other areas, livestock development and commercialization. \n \nAgriculture  accounts  for  approximately  52%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  with  livestock  and  fisheries \ncontributing 18%. More than 80% of the people depend on the agriculture and forestry sector for their livelihood, \nwith most practicing subsistence farming.  Among the subsistence farmers and smallholders, livestock is extremely \nimportant as source of wealth, draft power, livelihood, and income. Smallholders produce over 95% of all livestock, \nwhich is one of the most important sources of cash income for them. The importance of livestock, particularly for the \npoor  was  confirmed  through  ADB\u2019s  participatory  poverty  assessment  (PPA)  undertaken  in  2001.  The  poor \nconsidered livestock as an asset and safety net, to be sold when necessary.  \n \nThe PPA found that loss of livestock is one of the main causes of poverty, with 70% of those interviewed identifying \nlivestock disease as a major problem.  The poor in the north identified preventing and curing livestock disease as \ntheir first priority.1 Loss of livestock due to disease is particularly high for small livestock such as chicken and pigs, \nwith chicken mortality reported to be as high as 80%.2  This disproportionately impacts women farmers and \nrelatively poorer farmers who invest in smaller livestock. Loss of pigs is more devastating since high labor input is \nrequired to raise them. Raising large livestock such as cattle and buffalo is also difficult for the poor, given the high \nmortality rate of calves (30\u201340%), and low productivity.   \n \nGiven the importance of livestock as cash income for the poor, and taking into account the high mortality rates and \nlow productivity of different animals, the opportunity to improve the livelihood of the poor by strengthening livestock \nproduction  is  significant.    Since  farm  resource  use  varies  within  a  community,  the  project  should  consider \ninterventions that solve productivity issues of small and large livestock. Market opportunities for the poor to sell \nlivestock for cash should also be considered.  The PPTA will help assess the nature of current livestock production \nin villages, potential distribution of benefits among men and women farmers and different ethnic minorities, and \ndemonstrate how project benefits would accrue to the poor. \n \n \nB.    Poverty Analysis      Proposed Classification:  Poverty Intervention \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe project will be implemented in northern Lao PDR, which has the highest incidence of poverty, at 52.5%; 45.0% \nof the total poor population live in this region.3 Life expectancy is one of the lowest at 57 years. Literacy is the \nlowest, at 59%\u201444% for women and 74% for men.3 Northern villages are particularly isolated, and some have no \naccess to social services or markets, even during the dry season.  Many people have no food security as yields are \nlimited and high labor inputs required.  Opium is still an important source of income for villagers, and 90% of opium \nis estimated to be produced in this region.3 Ethnic minority groups include the Akha, Hmong, Khmou, Lao, Lue, and \nPhounoy, among others.  \n \nTo ensure the poverty focus of this project, the following will be reviewed:  (i) socioeconomic status of project area; \n(ii) classification of potential beneficiaries based on poverty status; (iii) baseline situation of the farming systems  \n(i.e. main crops grown for subsistence and for cash, livestock in the farming system, other key non-farm activities for \n1  ADB. 2001.

The information obtained will be used to ensure \nthat the project design is poverty focused and that benefits are shared equitably given different poverty levels, \ngender, and ethnic minority groups. \n \n \nC.   Participation Process \n \nStakeholder Analysis         Yes \n \nA stakeholder analysis will be undertaken during the PPTA to determine the stakeholders and their roles, interests, \nand priorities.  Stakeholders will likely include the national, provincial, and district level government officers; village \ncommunities; and the private sector.  The specific needs and priorities of the poor, including women and ethnic \nminority groups will be further assessed through the socioeconomic survey and analysis.  \n \nParticipation Strategy \nThe target beneficiaries must adopt and apply the practices and technologies introduced to improve animal \nproductivity. Early community participation is critical. Such participation will actively engage target beneficiaries from \nthe PPTA phase to ensure that the project design takes into account the socioeconomic context; interest and \npriorities in livestock husbandry by gender and ethnic groups; culture, gender, and language issues and other \naspects.  Given the important role of district officers in providing extension services and information to farmers, \nduring the PPTA, a review should be taken to consider staff requirements and capacity building needs.  District \nofficers should be involved as much as possible during the PPTA phase in undertaking the poverty and social \nanalysis of target beneficiaries. \n \nThe socioeconomic profile and feedback from village communities will be the basis for adapting information and \ntechnologies to fit the cultural and socioeconomic context, developing relevant and culturally appropriate materials \nand extension training packages, and determining appropriate approaches to extension work.  The community \nparticipation plan is expected to be gender sensitive approach and consider differences between ethnic minority \ngroups.   \n \nA social development specialist (international) together with a team of local consultants and national partners will \nundertake the socioeconomic survey and analysis, conduct participatory rural appraisals (PRAs), and develop the \ncommunity participation plan for the project.    \n \nD.  Gender \nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women \nWomen and girls, in particular ethnic minorities, are the most disadvantaged in Lao society.  Overall, women are \nless literate, less educated, and work longer than men, being primarily responsible for the family\u2019s well-being and  \nengaged in other livelihood activities.  Among the ethnic minority groups, women perform 70% of the agricultural \nand household tasks and have little access to labor saving devices, and to information.  \n \nSince they are mostly involved in raising small livestock, women should have the opportunity to participate in village \nactivities to introduce practices and technologies for small livestock, which would increase productivity while \nreducing labor inputs.  To reach women, especially the ethnic minorities and household heads, the extension and \ntraining modality, as well district officers\u2019 profile and capacity, including language skills, should be considered. The \nsocial development specialist, together with a team of local consultants is expected to review the constraints on \nwomen\u2019s  participation  through  socioeconomic  survey  and  analysis,  and  conducting  PRAs.    The  community \nparticipation plan will include measures to promote equitable participation of women in project activities. \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 1 \nE.
