An initial environmental examination was undertaken and \nAssessment  the summary is in Appendix 4. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will rehabilitate the selected irrigation and drainage (I&D) \nfacilities in Sughd and Vahdat districts in the Region of Republican \nSubordination,  Farkhor  and  Pianj  districts  in  Khathlon  Oblast,  and \nRushan district in Gorno Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast. Improved \nI&D services will cover an area of 47,500 hectares (ha), benefiting \n262,000  people  whose  livelihood  depends  solely  on  irrigated \nagriculture. A population of 57,000 will also gain access to safe drinking \nwater in these areas. \n \nThe Project will also provide farm support services to increase crop \nyields and improve on-farm land and water management, as well as \ncapacity building within the Ministry of Water Resources and Land \nReclamation (MWRLR) to promote participatory irrigation management \nthrough water users\u2019 associations (WUAs). \n \nProject Description  In addition, the Project will assist the Government in accelerating the \nimplementation  of  key  agriculture  sector  reforms  that  have  been \nrecommended  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical \nassistance (TA) 4052-TAJ: Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms, \nparticularly  in  the  areas  of  cotton  farm  debt,  land  reform,  farm \nprivatization, and water management. The Government has taken a \nstep forward by agreeing to further deepen the reforms in the project \nareas,  including  (i) improved  farm  structure,  operations,  and \nmanagement based on market-oriented principles; (ii) removal of cotton \nproduction  quotas,  and  involvement  of  local  authorities  in  directing \ncotton credit; (iii) issuance of tradable land lease certificates that can \nthen be used as collateral; and (iv) introduction of open cotton sales.  \n   \nRationale  The agriculture sector plays a significant role in Tajikistan\u2019s economy, \ncontributing 22% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employing 52% \nof the total workforce. Due to the arid climate of the country, irrigation is \ncrucial for agricultural production and 85% of the cultivated area is \nirrigated. \n \n ", "iv     \n  Most of the  I&D facilities  were built in the 1950s and 1960s,  and \nTajikistan has not been able to maintain them adequately due to the \ncivil war and the lack of financial resources. The decrepit state of the \nI&D facilities is resulting in a continuing decline in crop yield and farm \nprofitability, excessive water losses, low irrigation efficiency, and rapidly \nspreading water logging and soil salinization.  \n \n  Despite the relative abundance of water resources in the country, only \nabout 15% of the 4.6 million rural population are currently served by \nsafe, piped, drinking water. Morbidity due to unsafe drinking water is an \nacknowledged contributor to poverty in rural areas.  \n \nThe Project will address these problems by providing cost-effective and \npriority-based rehabilitation of key I&D facilities and easy-to-maintain \nrural water supply systems in areas selected through a systematic \nscreening process and stakeholder consultation.  \n \nThe rehabilitation of I&D facilities will provide the security of water \nservices\u2014the  most  serious  concern  of  many  rural  communities \naccording to the social analysis\u2014allowing increased yield and improved \noperational efficiency of the irrigation systems over an extended useful \nlife. In the longer run, the returns of the investment could be increased \nsubstantially,  if  the  ongoing  policy  reforms  are  strengthened  and \ndeepened. To accelerate the reform process, the Government agreed \nto implement specific reform actions (see Project Description above) in \nthe project areas, and to monitor and assess\u2014through an open and \nparticipatory  forum  involving  development  partners,  civil  society \nmembers, and other stakeholders\u2014the impacts for future replication. \n   \nObjective  The objective of the Project is to increase farm productivity and income \nof rural communities, and improve rural potable water supply schemes. \nThe Project will also support policy reforms with regard to cost recovery \nfor operation and maintenance (O&M), cotton financing and marketing, \nfarm restructuring, and farm debt resolution.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $29.0 million equivalent, \ncomprising  $13.3 million  (45.7%)  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and \n$15.7 million (54.3%) in local currency cost. The cost estimates include \nthe allocation of $4.3 million for taxes and duties and 5% of base costs \nfor physical contingencies.  \n      $ million equivalent \n  Source  Foreign  Local  Total \nPercent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nFinancing Plan  ADB  13.27  9.45  22.72  78.3 \n  Government  0.00  6.29  6.29  21.7 \n    Total  13.27  15.74  29.01  100.0 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n \n   ", "  v \n \nLoan Amount and  The proposed loan from the Special Funds resources of ADB is for \nTerms  Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 15,146,000 ($22.7 million equivalent) \nwhich will have a term of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years, and \nan interest rate of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR) \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, starting in July 2005. The \nArrangements  project management structure will rely on the experience gained during \nimplementation of three ADB-financed projects previously executed by \nMWRLR. A high-level project steering committee established during \nproject  preparation  will  continue  to  function  during  project \nimplementation to provide policy guidance and facilitate interministerial \ncoordination  at  the  central  level.  The  minister  of  MWRLR  will  be \ndesignated  as  project  director  with  overall  responsibility  for  project \nimplementation. A project management office (PMO) will be established \nwithin MWRLR to manage project activities and to liaise with ADB and \nthe coordinating bodies. Five regional offices (ROs) of PMO will be \nresponsible for project implementation in their areas, and will maintain \nliaison  with  the  PMO,  local  administration,  and  beneficiary \norganizations. The PMO will be led by a full-time manager and the ROs \nby regional managers. The PMO  manager will be nominated by the \nGovernment, and endorsed by ADB. The regional managers and key \nstaff  will  be  selected  by  a  panel  of  experts  appointed  by  the \nGovernment and agreed to by ADB. \n   \nProcurement  The Project will procure machinery, equipment, civil works, services, \nvehicles,  office  equipment,  and  materials.  All  procurement  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n   \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide 78 person-months of international and 606 \nperson-months of domestic consultants in areas for which technical \ncapacity is currently unavailable in MWRLR, including (i) institutional \ncapacity  building;  (ii) design,  preparation/evaluation  of  bidding \ndocuments,  and  construction  supervision;  (iii) agricultural  support \nservices; and (iv) project management, monitoring, and evaluation. The \ninternational consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  used  for  the  engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n   \n ", "vi     \nProject Benefits and  The Project will directly benefit an irrigation area of 47,500 hectares \nBeneficiaries  (ha) and 262,000 people, who depend primarily on irrigated agriculture \nfor their livelihood. The annual output of cotton in the project areas will \nincrease from 38,700 tons (t) to 47,700 t, and of wheat production from \n26,800 tons to 32,400 tons. Benefits also accrue from the reduction in \npumping  costs  and  savings  of  O&M  costs  in  the  I&D  systems, \namounting to about $1.5 million per year. \n \n  Rehabilitation of rural potable water supply systems will improve the \nhealth standards of 57,000 people, particularly women and children. \nOrganization and training of beneficiary organizations and transfer of \nmanagement  of  rehabilitated  systems  to  them  will  facilitate \nsustainability  of  the  benefits.  In  order  to  assist  extremely  poor \nhouseholds in the near term, government and project officials have \nagreed to hire, through project-financed contracts,  members of poor \nand  vulnerable  groups  from  local  villages  for  civil  works  to  the \nmaximum extent possible. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is 20.7% and \nthe economic net present value (NPV) at the discount rate of 12% is \n$9.9 million.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  EIRR  is  robust, \ndespite adverse effects of price and yield declines, benefit delays, and \ninvestment cost increases. The farm budget analyses for large and \nsmall farms and household plots in each district indicate that farm \nincomes at all levels will increase with the Project.  \n \nRisks and  The Project will be ADB\u2019s third investment  project implemented by \nAssumptions  MWRLR, which has demonstrated adequate implementation capacity in \nthe past. Thus the risk of implementation delays arising from MWRLR\u2019s \nunfamiliarity with ADB procedures is low. For the Project, MWRLR staff \nhave been closely involved in the project processing throughout project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  stage  and  thereafter,  and  their \nunderstanding and knowledge of the Project will also minimize the risk \nof initial implementation delays that are commonly observed in ADB \nprojects. \n \n  The risk of the rehabilitated I&D schemes not maintained adequately is \nsignificant.  Clearly,  the  Government  does  not  have  the  financial \nresources to ensure sustainable O&M without relying on recovery of \nirrigation service fees from beneficiaries. The Project addresses this \nrisk by (i) selecting, through systematic screening and consultation with \nstakeholders, I&D schemes with low O&M costs; (ii) helping develop \nparticipatory  management  of  I&D  systems  through  WUAs;  and \n(iii) assisting MWRLR implement an improved cost recovery policy.  \n   ", "  vii \n \n  The policy reform program to be implemented under the Project is \nambitious,  particularly  in  addressing  the  vested  interests  of  local \nauthorities,  cotton  investors,  and  local  government-appointed  farm \nmanagers. To implement the reforms, the Government needs a high \nlevel  of  political  commitment.  If  the  reforms  are  not  implemented \nproperly in a comprehensive manner, rural poverty  may significantly \ndeepen\u2014perhaps in the form of further accumulation of cotton farm \ndebts. On the other hand, if the reforms are implemented too rapidly, \ncotton  investors  may  decide  to  stay  out  of  the  business,  thereby \neffectively taking away the livelihood of many cotton farm workers. To \naddress these risks, the Project will establish an open and participatory \nforum, involving farmers, local authorities, development partners, civil \nsociety  and  cotton  investors,  to  regularly  review  and  assess  the \nprogress and impacts of reforms. \n \nTechnical  The Project provides for an associated technical assistance (TA) for \nAssistance  Support for Monitoring Policy Reforms and Improving Farm and Water \nManagement  to  (i) monitor  and  evaluate  progress  in  implementing \npolicy reforms in the project areas; (ii) promote competitive providers of \nfarm inputs, technical advice, credit, and marketing of products in the \nproject areas; and (iii) assist the Government in establishing a WUA \nsupport  unit  within  MWRLR.  The  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at \n$625,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 equivalent will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program.  \n \nThe TA will provide for 12 person-months of international and 37 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services. The consultants will \nbe selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. Other arrangements satisfactory to ADB will \nbe used for the engagement of domestic consultants. The TA will be \nimplemented over a period of 24 months, starting in early 2006. \n \n \n ", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nix\n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (IRP). The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Support for Monitoring of Policy Reforms and \nImproving Farm and Water Management, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  At the request of the Government of Tajikistan, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved a TA1 to prepare the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project. The preparatory TA was carried \nout from January to August 2004. This report and recommendation of the President is based on \nthe  consultants\u2019  reports,  the  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with  government \nagencies,  potential  beneficiaries  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The  Project \nframework is shown in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  The agriculture sector plays a significant role in Tajikistan\u2019s economy, contributing 22% \nof gross domestic product (GDP). This role has increased since independence because the \nsector has provided an important social safety net as industry has contracted. Currently, the \nsector generates 30% of export revenues, 35% of tax revenues, and employs 52% of the total \nwork force, despite the fact that only 9% of the total land area is arable. Cereals and cotton are \nthe most important crops, accounting in 2003 for 46% and 32%, respectively, of the sown area.  \n \n4.  Due to its arid climate, irrigation is crucial for agricultural production, and irrigated areas \nconstitute  85%  of  total  agricultural  production  areas.  Most  irrigation  and  drainage  (I&D) \nschemes were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s. Many have reached the end of their useful \nlives, and require major rehabilitation. The infrastructure has further deteriorated due to the civil \nwar, lack of capital investment, and inadequate operation and maintenance (O&M) funds. This \nis worsened by the fact that the end water users have virtually no participation in O&M.  \n \n5.  The poor condition of I&D facilities results in excessive water losses, low irrigation \nefficiencies, waterlogging, soil salinization, and declining crop yields. It is estimated that due to \nthe  poor  condition  of  I&D  infrastructure,  16%  of  formerly  irrigated  land  has  been  out  of \nproduction since 1991. Therefore, rehabilitation of these systems is a key intervention to boost \nagriculture sector productivity and farm profitability. Inadequate irrigation supplies, insufficient \ninputs  and  financing,  and  lack  of  agricultural  support  services  have  led  to a decline in \nagricultural productivity. Cotton production has fallen from 800,000 tons (t) in 1990 to 450,000 t \nin  2002.  Current  cotton  yields  average  1.7  t/hectare  (ha)  compared  with  2.8 t/ha before \nindependence. Wheat yields are also low at an average of 1.3 t/ha. The reduced productivity \nresulted in declining profitability of farms and increased poverty incidence in rural areas.  \n \n6.  Falling on-farm incomes, coupled with the lack of adequate off-farm income-generating \nopportunities, have been the major factors in the widespread income poverty in the country. The \nupdated  World  Bank  Living  Standard  Survey  (2004)  reported  that  the  country\u2019s  poverty \nincidence was 70% in 2003, the highest in Central Asia. Poverty is more prevalent in rural areas \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  Water  Resources  Rehabilitation  and \nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n ", "2     \nwhere more than three fourths of the country\u2019s population resides. Half of the workforce is \ndependent on agriculture for income, the majority of whom rely on miniscule plots of land (about \n0.1  ha  per  household)  for  their  subsistence.  Income  poverty  is  severe ni  the countryside \nbecause of lack of income-earning and job opportunities outside the agriculture sector, and the \ndeclining productivity of the land. Inadequate irrigation water supplies and farm inputs, imperfect \nmarkets, and insecure land tenure rights have contributed to the poor performance of the \nagriculture sector. Rural poverty is also nonincome based. A key element of nonincome poverty \nis the lack of safe drinking water, as only 40% of the country\u2019s population use piped water.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n \n7.  Water  Management.  The  rehabilitation  of  I&D  systems  and  improved  water \nmanagement are crucial for improving the performance of irrigated agriculture. Since 1991, the \nmajority of pumping stations and the main I&D works have not been properly funded, operated, \nor maintained. As a consequence, there has been a rapid deterioration of pumping stations, \nincreased water losses in the main canals, and low field-level water-use efficiency.  \n \n8.  The role of water sector institutions is closely related to performance of the I&D systems \nand their O&M. The Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR) plays a key \nrole in the administration of water resources. In particular, it is responsible for the construction \nand O&M of I&D infrastructure and of river regulation works. The O&M of the secondary canal \nlevel and the on-farm infrastructure can be divested as the main responsibility of the water \nusers\u2019 associations (WUAs). The existing associations operate on the basis of legislation in the \nWater Code, the Civil Code, and the Law on Public Associations. The ADB-funded TA 4052-\nTAJ:  Farm  Debt  Resolution  and  Policy  Reforms  has  made  specific  recommendations \nconcerning changes to the legal framework to strengthen the water institutions.  \n \n9.  Rural Potable Water Supply. Only about 15% of the 4.6 million people, who live in rural \nareas, are currently served by drinking water. During the winter months, reduced availability of \npower supplies typically restrict water supply to 2 hours per day and many rural people pay $3\u2013\n5 per cubic meter (m3) to have water delivered by truck to their village. Morbidity due to unsafe \ndrinking water is an acknowledged contributor to poverty in rural areas. There are 669 publicly \nowned water supply schemes in Tajikistan, but due to lack of funding and damage sustained \nduring the civil war, most of these are in a state of disrepair. Opportunities to improve water \nsupplies are hampered by institutional barriers and existing taxation rules.  \n \n10.  Agricultural Support Services. Most farms suffer from inadequate supplies of inputs, \nthe absence of extension services, and inefficient farm management. Since 1997, the situation \nhas been exacerbated by cotton debt built up, because local intermediary companies, called \n\u201cinvestors,\u201d2 frequently have a monopoly on the supply of inputs, which are provided late and at \ninflated prices. Improving access to inputs coupled with the promotion of improved production \ntechniques  would  increase  farm  productivity  by  helping  farmers  improve  crop  yields,  and \ndiversify cropping to achieve higher revenues (para. 36). \n \n11.  Government Agriculture Sector Policy. The Government is currently implementing \nmajor policy initiatives in the sector: (i) farm privatization, (ii) increasing competition in the \n                                                 \n2  These are cotton traders/exporters who provide seasonal credit, mostly in kind, to farmers using cotton as \ncollateral. Generally, the local governments nominate one investor per district. \n   ", "  3 \n \nprovision of essential agricultural support services, and (iii) price liberalization3 and privatization \nof agribusiness enterprises. In the medium-term, the Government will focus the reform agenda \non  (i) reforms  of  the  land  and  water  sectors  to  increase  privatization  and  cost  recovery; \n(ii) development of a rural finance system; and (iii) restructuring of government institutions to fit \na  market-oriented  economy.  The  main  objectives  of  the  Government\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy Paper4 (PRSP) include better access of the poor to land and water, and the creation of \na favorable framework for private sector involvement in agriculture. \n \n12.  Agriculture Sector Reforms. Since independence, the Government has introduced a \nrange of reforms intended to transform agriculture into a competitive market-oriented sector: \n(i) the state procurement system for agricultural commodities has been dismantled; (ii) price \ncontrols have been reduced; (iii) ongoing land reform allows private farms to operate based on \nlife-long heritable, but not tradable leases; and (iv) irrigation service fees have been introduced, \nto partly recover O&M costs. However, the implementation of these reforms is poor, because of \nthe lack of adequate capacity and resources of the public institutions to implement the reforms \nand provide the required services to private farmers, and because of the mindset of the local \nadministrations that continue to interfere with farm management and marketing of produce.  \n \n13.  Land is the property of the state and farmers are given heritable, but not tradable, land \nuse rights. In 2002, some 500 state farms were transformed into collective farms, joint-stock \ncompanies, or cooperative farms.5 At present, the lack of information on legal rights, and clear \nguidelines for the land reform process, leads to exploitation of farmers by local authorities and \nvested interests. The current cotton farm debt burden (paras. 15  and  16), and inability to \ntransfer and mortgage land use rights, restricts the financing of farm operations and farm \nrestructuring. Since 2004, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been coordinating \nthe development of a common strategy for the restructuring of state farms.  \n \n14.  Irrigation service fees were first introduced in 1996 and collection rates have risen from \nabout 15% in 1997 to 59% in 2003. Until recently, there has been a single national tariff \nequivalent to $2 per 1,000 m3 of water delivered to the farm. In June 2004, a regulation was \nissued by the Government establishing a differential rate for Sughd region, of $3.30 equivalent \nper 1,000 m3, because of the high proportion of pump irrigation. Changing the structure of \nirrigation water fees to reflect differences in system costs (e.g., the high costs of pumping water) \nwould help achieve higher efficiencies in water utilization and agricultural production, more \nappropriate  cropping  patterns,  and  higher  productivity  and  return  per  unit  of  water.  The \nGovernment is also committed under the World Bank Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project \nto gradually increasing irrigation service fees to finance the full amount of O&M costs. \n \n15.  Cotton Farm Debts. Tajikistan was a major supplier of cotton fiber to the former Soviet \neconomy. After independence, Tajikistan\u2019s cotton lost both its market and source of financing. \nTherefore, the Government directed loans through the National Bank of Tajikistan to fund cotton \nproduction of the state-owned farms, which resulted in huge annual carryover of operating \ndebts. In 1996, this practice was terminated by an agreement with the International Monetary \nFund (IMF). To continue funding of cotton production, the Government, in 1997, entered into an \nagreement to borrow and guarantee a loan of $60 million from a banking consortium led by \n                                                 \n3  The Government has fully liberalized the prices of fruits, vegetables, grain, and livestock inputs and products. \nHowever, the cotton sector continues to be affected by low raw seed cotton producer prices, mostly as a result of \nhigh levels of taxation and high transaction costs involved in the marketing, transport, and export of lint cotton. \n4  The Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (PRSP) was approved by the Parliament of the Republic of Tajikistan in \nJune 2002. \n5  Usually, the farm chairperson holds a land certificate for the farm, and individual farmers are not fully independent. \n. ", "4     \nCredit Suisse First Boston. Funds from this loan were loaned to cotton farms through local \ninvestors. However, the manner in which cotton contracts between the investors and farm \nmanagers are implemented was often inconsistent with sound financial principles. For example, \nthe production target is not led by farm profitability, but by the production quota determined by \nthe  local  authorities.  The  choice  of  investors  is  not  with  the  farmers,  but  with  the  local \nauthorities. The inputs provided under the contract are often overpriced. Also, there are issues \ninternal to farm management: the \u201creorganized\u201d farms are run by farm managers appointed by \nlocal authorities, and many farm workers are unaware of farm reorganization at all.  \n \n16.  The lack of competition in cotton financing and processing, and the absence of freedom \nof choice for farmers has resulted in steady decline of cotton farm productivity and profitability, \nand the accumulation of debts estimated at $180 million as of January 2004.  ADB has been \nplaying a major role in studying the debt issue and seeking a solution in consultation with the \nGovernment  and  other  development  partners.  In  October  2002,  ADB  sponsored  the  first \nroundtable on farm debt and subsequently implemented TA 4052-TAJ: Farm Debt Resolution \nand Policy Reforms, which recommended comprehensive policy initiatives and specific actions \nto resolve farm debts, including (i) improving farm structure, operations, and management; \n(ii) abolishing cotton production quotas, and involvement of local authorities in cotton credit; \n(iii) issuing tradable land lease certificates that can be used as collateral; (iv) establishing strict \nlending rules/practices; (v) adopting international cotton grading standards; and (vi) introducing \nopen cotton sales, simplified cotton export procedures, and reduced costs of cotton exports. \n \n17.  External Assistance to Agriculture and Water Sectors. Most external assistance to \nTajikistan  has  been  related  to  emergencies,  structural  adjustment,  and  infrastructure \nrehabilitation. ADB has financed two projects in the water sector\u2014the Emergency Restoration of \nthe  Yavan  Water  Conveyance  Project,  and  the  ARP.  ARP  supports  rehabilitation  of  I&D \nfacilities; establishment of farm machinery units, seed multiplication, and pest control programs; \nand supports the construction of rural water supply systems. Various development partners are \nassisting Tajikistan in implementing agriculture sector reforms. The World Bank has promoted \nfarm privatization, land certificate distribution, rural credit institutions, irrigation rehabilitation, \nand establishment of WUAs. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \nhas supported establishment and development of WUAs. The International Finance Corporation \nmanages a program, creating an example of transparent and profitable cotton production. The \nEuropean  Union  has  provided  grants  for  development  of  small  businesses,  and  currently \nprovides support to issue land titles. FAO has established a monitoring mechanism for the land \nreform  process  and  supported  veterinary  services  in  rural  areas.  The  Department  for \nInternational Development assists in setting up the legal framework for cotton debt dispute \nresolution. The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) is providing \nassistance  to  cadastral  mapping  and  a  land  registration.  The  Government  of  Japan  has \nprovided $20 million grant for procurement of agricultural machinery and inputs. NGOs such as \nCooperative for Asian and Relief  Everywhere (CARE), the Aga Khan Foundation, Agence \nd'Aide \u00e0 la Coop\u00e9ration Technique et au D\u00e9veloppement (ACTED), and Oxfam are involved in \nrural development and community support. Major external assistance to the sector is shown in \nAppendix 3. \n \n18.  ADB Country Strategy. ADB\u2019s current country strategy and program (CSP)6 identifies \nrural development as a strategic focus to support more inclusive growth; improve productivity \nand  profitability  in  the  rural  sector  through  institution  building  that  strengthens  policy \nimplementation and promotes private sector activities; and improve infrastructure (irrigation). \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132008): Tajikistan. Manila. \n   ", "  5 \n \nThe CSP update7 recognizes ADB\u2019s role in spearheading the assistance to the Government in \nresolving the cotton farm debt issues (para. 15), noting that the cotton debt problem needs to be \naddressed through a well-designed restructuring program in phases. The CSP also states that \nADB will continue its support for (i) rehabilitation of I&D facilities, (ii) improvements in rural \npotable  water  supply,  (iii) establishment  of  community-based  organizations,  and \n(iv) improvements in agricultural support services and financing.  \n \n19.  Lessons Learned. ADB has financed two projects in the water sector. The first is the \nalready completed Emergency Restoration of the Yavan Water Conveyance Project, and the \nARP, for which implementation started in 2003. MWRLR is the Executing Agency (EA) for both \nprojects.  The  performance  of  MWRLR  in  these  projects  was  carefully  reviewed,  and  its \nstrengths (construction supervision and interaction with local authorities) as well as weaknesses \n(weak coordination with other agencies, and limited planning and design capacity) have been \nfully reflected in the proposed project implementation arrangements and in drawing the terms of \nreference for the project consultants. The lessons learned from other water sector projects, \nhave also been incorporated in the Project\u2019s design. These include (i) the need to involve the \nprimary stakeholders in construction, monitoring, and supervision of irrigation subprojects; and \n(ii) the need for clear targets to monitor participatory processes undertaken. To avoid common \nstart-up delays, the staff of MWRLR have been closely involved in preparing the feasibility \nstudy, and local authorities have been consulted frequently during project design, so that they \nmay acquire full understanding of the project design and the implementation arrangements. \n \n20.  The Project\u2019s reform agenda is designed on the experience and lessons learned from \nother Central Asian countries, particularly Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. While \nthe progress of reforms in these countries varies, monitoring the impacts of the reforms, \nparticularly in terms of rural poverty, has been often neglected. Applying the reform agenda on a \npilot basis, by limiting it in the project-specific context, has a better chance of acceptance, and \nof scaling up. The experience in the Kyrgyz Republic also shows the need for investment and \npolicy support for the restructured farms, and completion of land reform and farm privatization \nas the priority reform issues. These lessons have been suitably incorporated in prioritizing and \ndesigning the implementation arrangements for the specific reform agenda under the Project.  \n \n21.  Further, from its various projects in the region, the World Bank8 has concluded that \n(i) proper sequencing is important for successful reform; (ii) the reform agenda must proceed at \na pace at which it receives the support of elected representatives and civil society; (iii) delaying \ninvestments until the policies are right can reduce the ability to help the poor and can increase \nthe cost of investments; (iv) modest investments combined with focused policy reforms are most \nlikely to be successful; and (v) project design should be simple and, geographically focused.  \n \n22.  Project Rationale. Most of Tajikistan\u2019s I&D facilities have long reached the end of their \nuseful life. Major facilities were destroyed during the civil war and the remaining facilities have \nfurther deteriorated due to neglected O&M in the postwar period. The worsening condition of \nI&D infrastructure results in declining crop yields and farm profitability, as well as excessive \nwater losses, low irrigation efficiency, and rapidly spreading land degradation\u2014including water \nlogging and soil salinization. If I&D facilities are allowed to further deteriorate, the country\u2019s \nirrigated area is estimated to be reduced by 20% within 10 years, resulting in a huge disruption \nin the primary livelihood of a large and poor farming population. In addition, morbidity due to \nunsafe drinking water is an acknowledged contributor to poverty in rural areas. The Government \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Tajikistan. Manila. \n8  World Bank. 2002. Reaching the Rural Poor in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Washington, DC. \n. ", "6     \nplaces high priority on restoring and improving the key water sector infrastructure facilities\u2014I&D \nand rural water supply\u2014toward achieving its goal of reducing rural poverty. \n \n23.  The nine districts proposed by the Government for inclusion in the Project were ranked \nthrough a systematic screening and stakeholder consultation process. The selection criteria \nincluded the need for irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation and low O&M costs; social, financial, \nand economic indicators; high potential to increase agricultural production; and environmental \nimpacts. Subsequently, irrigation schemes in five districts, covering 47,500 ha, were selected. \n \n24.  The Project will support low-income farmers by improving livelihood and income through \nthe provision of improved irrigation and potable water supplies, and the promotion of sustainable \nand profitable agricultural practices. Improvement in productivity and income that the Project \nintends to deliver will bring substantial impacts on reducing poverty in the project areas. The \nreturns of investment, however, could still be improved further, if the persisting policy constraints \nthat  significantly  affect  farm  productivity  and  profitability,  are  addressed.  These  constraints \ninclude slow and uneven progress in farm privatization; continuing strong public authorities\u2019 \ninterventions in farm management and in access to credit and inputs; monopoly in cotton \nfinancing and marketing; and inadequate O&M of I&D facilities. The Project will assist the \nGovernment  address  these  policy  constraints  by  implementing  specific  reforms  within  the \nproject areas, and by monitoring and assessing the impacts for future replication.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n25.  The Project\u2019s goal is to improve the living standards of the rural population in the project \nareas. The purposes of the Project are to increase productivity and income of rural communities \nin the project areas, and to improve the access of the rural population to potable water supply. \nThe Project will cover the four poorest provinces of the country. In the northern province of \nSughd, work will be carried out on the Asht-1 irrigation scheme. In the Central Region of \nRepublican Subordination, irrigation systems in Vahdat district will be targeted. In the southern \nprovince of Khatlon, work will be done in both Farkhor and Panj districts. In the remote eastern \nGorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast, the irrigation infrastructure in Rushon will be repaired. \nAn estimated 262,000 beneficiaries live in the project areas, of whom 153,000 are poor. During \nstakeholder meetings at the project sites, three general themes emerged as causes of poverty: \nlack  of  reliable  irrigation  and  drinking  water  supplies,  limited  opportunities  to  become \nindependent farmers, and lack of jobs. These causes are addressed in the project design.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n26.  To achieve higher crop productivity and income of rural communities, the Project will \n(i) rehabilitate the selected irrigation infrastructure and support improved water management; \n(ii) rehabilitate the selected water supply schemes and establish water supply committees for \nsustained  O&M;  (iii) provide  agricultural  support  to  farmers;  and  (iv) establish appropriate \nmechanisms for project management, monitoring, and evaluation.  \n \n27.  The key outputs of the Project in terms of increasing productivity and rural incomes are  \n(i) rehabilitated  I&D  systems  at  the  project  sites,  (ii) improved  water  management,  and \n(iii) improved agricultural practices and technologies. The key outputs to improving access to \nsafe  drinking  water  are  the  reconstruction  of  potable  drinking  water  supply  systems  and \nimproved participatory management of these facilities. The Project\u2019s outputs also include the \n   ", "  7 \n \nestablishment of a project management office. The Project is also accompanied by a set of \nassurances by the Government to implement a specific reform program within the project areas. \nA brief description of project components follows. \n \n1.  Rehabilitation  of  Infrastructure  and  Support  for  Improved  Water \nManagement \n \n28.  In Sughd district (Asht-1 irrigation system), the Project will  (i) improve the intake and \nprovide  sediment  removal  facilities;  (ii) rehabilitate  the  lowest  pumping  station  (ANS-1), \nincluding replacement of pipeline sections, and construct a protective shelterbelt for pipelines; \n(iii) rehabilitate pumping stations ANS-2 and ANS-3B; (iv) provide gravity irrigation supply to the \nupper system levels;9 and (v) renovate canal linings, structures, and restore drain capacities. \n \n29.  In  Vahdat  district  (Rohati  and  Dashtibed  irrigation  systems),  the  works  include \n(i) rehabilitation of the headworks and a major siphon of the Rohati canal, (ii) rehabilitation of the \nheadworks of the Dashtibed canal and provision of a weir across the Kofarnihon river, and \n(iii) repairs to selected structures on both systems.  \n \n30.  In Farkhor district, the Project will focus on improving sediment and water control and \nprioritized  rehabilitation  of  the  Urtaboz  pumping  system,  including  (i) improvement of the \nChubek headworks, construction of a new sediment removal facility,10 and provision of sediment \nremoval equipment; (ii) repair of canal linings and control structures and restoration of hydraulic \nperformance of key canals/drains; and (iii) priority rehabilitation of the Urtaboz pumping stations.  \n \n31.  In  Panj  district,  the  rehabilitation  work  comprises  (i) improvement  of  intake, \n(ii) rehabilitation  of  sediment  removal  facilities/provision  of  sediment  removal  equipment, \n(iii) repair  of  key  control  structures,  (iv) improvement  of  hydraulic  efficiency  of  canal/drain \nsections, and (v) priority rehabilitation of the Fayazabadkala pumping stations.11     \n \n32.  In Rushon district, the works cover repairs to small systems: (i) rehabilitation of intake \nworks and removal of large rocks from canals, (ii) selective repair of control structures and canal \nlinings, and (iii) restoration of main drains capacity.  \n \n33.  Desilting of canals and drains within the schemes in Farkhor and Panj districts will be \ncarried out by MWRLR. The Government has  given an assurance to ADB that adequate \nbudgetary allocations will be made to complete these works12 before the award of civil works \ncontracts financed by the Project.  \n \n34.  Improved  Water  Resources  Management.  The  Project  will  finance  institutional \ncapacity building of the water management agencies and improvement of water management \nprocedures. The Project will also facilitate an increased role for the water users. WUAs will be \nestablished in the project areas to ensure sustainable O&M of the rehabilitated systems, and \nstrengthen rural water sector institutions. The goal is to have WUAs operating successfully at \nthe project sites. The formation of WUAs will initially focus on the core demonstration areas, to \n                                                 \n9  Providing a gravity irrigation supply to an area that at present receives pumped water supplies.  \n10  The location of this facility will be decided during the detailed design phase, in consultation with MWRLR. \n11  The scope of replacement of pipelines will be reviewed during the detailed design stage, and corresponding \nbudget realignment within the allocation for rehabilitation of the cascades will be made if necessary. \n12  These works involve (i) excavation of 440,000 m3 of sediments from drains, 255,000 m3 from canals, and leveling \nof 475,000 m3 of previously removed material in Farkhor district; and (ii) excavation of 410,000 m3 from drains, \n145,000 m3 from canals, and leveling of 180,000 m3 in Panj district.  \n. ", "8     \nshowcase improved land and water management techniques. A key element in the Project's \nWUA strengthening activities is the establishment of a WUA support unit at MWRLR, which will \nbe supported by the TA accompanying the loan (para. 57).  The purpose of this unit will be the \ninstitutionalization of WUA support, and its integration in MWRLR's planning activities.  \n \n2.  Agricultural Support to Farmers  \n \n35.  There are severe deficiencies in the supply of quality seeds and in pest management in \nthe project areas. The ADB-financed ARP already includes subprograms for seed improvement \nand pest management, implemented by the Agricultural Academy of Sciences. These programs \nwill be extended in the core demonstration areas, where crop husbandry trials will be introduced \nto promote increased crop productivity, crop diversification, and intensification, together with \nimproved water management practices. Demonstration plots, with a total area of 500 ha, will be \nimplemented in each of the five project areas and training will be provided to district agricultural \nstaff. An integrated pest management (IPM) program will be implemented in each district, to \nintroduce farmers to the IPM concept. The program will be implemented by the Agricultural \nAcademy of Sciences and supported by local and international research institutes. Upgrading \nthe quality of seed and introducing IPM could increase yields by more than 30%.  \n \n3.  Improvement of Rural Potable Water Supply Systems \n \n36.  The Project will support reconstruction of five rural potable water supply systems within \nthe project areas and will provide drinking water to 57,000 beneficiaries. Villages to benefit from \nthe Project were selected in consultation with local communities and MWRLR. Criteria used in \nselection of target villages included (i) absence of a safe water source at present, (ii) potential \nfor  poverty  reduction  through  provision  of  an  improved  water  source,  and  (iii) the priority \naccorded by local community representatives and MWRLR.  \n \n37.  The main works include (i) construction of intakes, a reservoir, distribution pipework, and \nstandpipes in Asht; (ii) construction of wells, and repairs to reservoirs and distribution network in \nVahdat district; (iii) provision of pumps and generators, repairs to reservoirs and distribution \npipework in Farkhor; (iv) construction of wells, reservoirs, pumping stations, pipelines, and \nprovision  of  generators  in  Panj;  and  (v) construction  of  an  intake,  storage  reservoir,  and \ndistribution pipework in Rushon. After construction, community-based water committees will \noperate  the  systems.  The  Project,  working  with  the  local  administration,  will  facilitate  the \nformation of water committees for each scheme at an early stage of the Project. Furthermore, \nthe  communities  will  provide  assistance  during  construction,  in  digging  pipeline  trenches. \nTraining will be given to the water committees to prepare them to carry out their responsibilities. \n \n4.  Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n \n38.  The Project will establish and provide support to a project management office (PMO) in \nMWRLR, Dushanbe and five regional offices (ROs), the one for Vahdat operating out of the \nPMO in Dushanbe and the others based in their project areas. ROs will be responsible for \nproject  implementation  in  their  areas,  and  for  maintaining  liaison  with  the  PMO,  local \nadministration, and beneficiary organizations. A monitoring and evaluation (M&E) unit will be \nestablished within the PMO to implement the environmental monitoring system recommended in \nthe summary initial environmental examination (Appendix 4) and to monitor the economic, \npoverty, gender, social and environmental impacts of the Project. Specifically, the M&E unit will \nbe responsible for (i) collecting, collating, and analyzing baseline data relating to the economic, \npoverty, social, and environmental conditions disaggregated by gender, income, and farm types \n   ", "  9 \n \nwithin the project areas; (ii) benefit monitoring during project implementation; and (iii) evaluating \nthe Project\u2019s economic, poverty, gender, social, and environmental impacts within the selected \nsystems. The M&E unit will have two staff members, who will work with the responsible \nagencies. For environmental monitoring, they will collect and analyze data relating to the quality \nof I&D water, soil chemistry, and groundwater depth and quality, and will provide a comparison \nof the before and after project situations. Project performance monitoring and evaluation will be \ndone in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines on its project performance management system.  \n \n39.  To monitor the Project\u2019s social impact, during the first year of project implementation, the \nM&E unit will compile a benchmark database on basic economic and social conditions to \nprovide a socioeconomic profile of the beneficiary communities. Key indicators will be tracked \nduring project implementation and a comparison made between the benchmark and project \ncompletion situations. The database will be analyzed to provide an assessment of the Project\u2019s \nimpact on different social groups, including women and low-income households.  \n \n  5.  Policy Reforms in the Project Areas \n \n40.  To deepen the ongoing agriculture sector reforms, the Government has agreed to \nimplement specific pilot-based reform actions in the project areas, including (i) improved farm \nstructure, operations, and management based on market-oriented principles; (ii) removal of \ncotton  production  quotas,  and  involvement  of  local  authorities  in  directing  cotton  credit; \n(iii) issuance  of  tradable  land  lease  certificates  that  can  then  be  used  as  collateral;  and \n(iv) introduction of open cotton sales. These actions would help farms reorganize into a proper \nsize, under self-elected farm managers; accelerate land reforms; and substantially improve the \nprofitability, and hence productivity, of cotton, as well as of other crops. To help the Government \nsuccessfully implement these reforms, an associated TA is proposed to provide technical \nexpertise and resources, including establishment of an open, participatory framework, involving \nfarmers, local authorities and investors, to guide, monitor, and assess the progress of reforms. \n \nC.  Special Features  \n \n41.  Recognizing and promoting the primary beneficiaries\u2019 role in O&M of I&D facilities is an \nimportant element in improving system performance, water management, and cost recovery, as \nwell as ensuring equitable distribution of irrigation regardless of gender or poverty. The Project \nsupports  participatory  irrigation  management  through  development  of  WUAs,  in  close \ncollaboration with other development partners, including the USAID, which in principle, agreed \nto support the establishment of WUAs in the Asht-2 irrigation system in Sughd. The progress \nand impacts of the reform agenda under the Project will have a significant influence on future \nsector reforms. Therefore, the Government has agreed to review the Project\u2019s reform progress \nat a national-level forum, involving development partners, NGOs, and other stakeholders. To \nmaximize employment and income-generating opportunities at the project sites, government \nofficials have agreed to hire, through project-financed contracts, poor and vulnerable groups for \ncivil works to the maximum extent possible. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n42.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $29.0 million  equivalent,  comprising \n$13.3 million (45.7%) in foreign exchange cost and $ 15.7 million (54.3%) in local currency cost. \nThe cost estimates include $4.3 million for taxes and duties, and 5% of base costs for physical \ncontingencies. Summary cost estimates are in Table 1, and details are provided in Appendix 5. \n \n. ", "10    \nE.  Financing Plan  \n \n43.  ADB will finance $22.7 million, representing 78.3% of total project costs, as a loan from \nthe Asian Development Fund (ADF). ADB will finance 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the \nProject and 60% of the local currency cost. The Borrower will be the Republic of Tajikistan. The \nBorrower will provide $6.3 million equivalent, amounting to 21.7% of project costs. The loan \nfrom the ADF will have a term of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years. Interest on the ADF \nloan is 1% during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation  \n \n44.  The project management structure will take into account the experience gained during \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s projects executed by MWRLR, 13 the project EA.14 A high-level steering \ncommittee established during project preparation will continue to provide policy guidance and \nfacilitate interministerial coordination.15 The minister of MWRLR will be the project director with \noverall responsibility for project implementation. A PMO will be established within MWRLR to \nmanage project activities and to liaise with ADB and with other coordinating bodies. Five ROs \nwill be established, the one for Vahdat operating out of the PMO in Dushanbe and the others \nbased in their subproject area. ROs will be responsible for project implementation in their areas, \nand for maintaining liaison with local administrations, and beneficiary organizations. The PMO \nwill be led by a full-time manager and the ROs by regional managers. The PMO manager will be \nnominated by the Government and endorsed by ADB. The regional managers and other key \nstaff will be selected by a panel of experts appointed by the Government.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n45.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, starting in July 2005. Project activities \nduring the first year will concentrate on selecting and fielding consultants, procuring equipment, \ndeveloping  operational  systems  for  the  PMO/ROs,  and  training  their  staff.  Field  surveys, \ninvestigations, preparation of designs and bidding documents, and agricultural support activities \nin the five project districts will also commence in the first year. The Project civil works will be \nimplemented in separate packages with construction starting in the second half of year 2. The \nproject implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 6.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n46.  Machinery,  equipment,  civil  works,  and  services;  vehicles;  office  equipment;  and \nmaterials required for project implementation will be procured following  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. To the extent possible, the Project will procure similar items in groups to optimize \nvolume discounts. Equipment supply and installation contracts estimated at $500,000 or more \nwill be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Contracts costing less than \n$500,000 will be awarded on the basis of international shopping procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n47.  Each civil works contract estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.0 million or more will be \nawarded on the basis of international competitive bidding among prequalified contractors as \ndescribed  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  packages  costing  less  than \n$1.0 million will be carried out on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures acceptable \nto ADB. For works whose size, nature, and location make them unsuitable for competitive \nbidding, and if MWRLR has the facilities and capacity to implement these works expeditiously \nand at a reasonable cost, ADB may agree to force account procedures. The works to be \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Tajikistan for the Agricultural Rehabilitation Project. Manila.  \n14  EA has been assessed by TA 4052-TAJ, and TA recommendations are incorporated in the project design.    \n15  The project steering committee is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of agriculture, water, land, and of \nenvironment protection. The members of the committee include the Minister of MWRLR, Minister of Agriculture, \nDeputy Minister of Nature Protection and Forestry, Chairman of State Committee for Land Management, Deputy \nMinister of Finance, Deputy Minister of Economy and Trade, and Deputy Minister of Health. \n. ", "12    \nimplemented through force account will be determined during implementation. The upper limit \nfor a force account works package will be $50,000. A list of contract packages is in Appendix 7. \n \n48.  To  procure  goods  and  services  with  the  loan  proceeds,  the  Borrower will need to \ndemonstrate that the local procurement procedures adopted are transparent and efficient, and \nconform with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy. The EA will certify to ADB that the goods and services \nfinanced by the loan are procured from ADB member countries. Where the value of goods \nfinanced by the loan exceeds $1,000,000, a preshipment inspection certificate from an agency, \nacceptable to ADB, will be required. The award of contracts will be subject to approval by ADB. \n \n4.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n49.  At the Government's request, ADB has approved retroactive financing of PMO and ROs \nstaff, facilities, and equipment to facilitate timely establishment of these management offices \nand accelerate project implementation. The retroactive financing will be provided to finance \neligible expenditures under contracts approved only on or after appraisal date, and will be \nsubject to a ceiling of $100,000 equivalent covering the expenses incurred in the period from 16 \nSeptember 2004 to effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. The Government has been informed \nthat  (i) advance  action  for  the  procurement  of  items  other  than  those  covered  under  the \nretroactive financing will cover actions up to, but not including, contract signing; and (ii) approval \nof advance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n50.  The Project will provide a total of 684 person-months of consulting services, comprising \n78 person-months of international consultants and 606 person-months of domestic consultants \nto supplement MWRLR's project management capacity. To minimize the over reliance on \nconsultants and the burden of consulting services costs, input of international consultants has \nbeen kept to a minimum, restricted to areas for which technical capacity is limited in government \nagencies; institutional capacity-building programs have also been incorporated in the project \ndesign.  The  consultants  will  assist  MWRLR  in  (i) design,  procurement,  and  construction \nsupervision; (ii) agricultural support services; and (iii) project management, monitoring, and \nevaluation. These services will be provided by an international consulting firm(s) in association \nwith  domestic  consulting  firm(s)  to  be  engaged  by  MWRLR  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants.16 \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n51.  An imprest account will be established at a bank acceptable to ADB, to facilitate the \ntimely  release  of  loan  funds  for  payments  in  local  currency.  During  the  first  year  of \nimplementation, the ceiling of the imprest account will be set at $500,000. Subsequently, the \nimprest account ceiling should be 6 months\u2019 estimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, \nwhichever is lower. The imprest account will be established and managed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures will be used \nto  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  the  imprest  account  for  payments  not  exceeding \n$100,000 equivalent per payment. \n \n \n                                                 \n16  ADB's quality- and cost-based selection method will be used. \n   ", "  13 \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n52.  MWRLR will keep separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which will \nbe audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Loan proceeds will be used for \nengaging auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited financial statements will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. A \nseparate opinion on the use of imprest account and statement of expenditures procedures will \nbe included in the audit report. The Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of \naudited accounts, which covers failure in submitting audited accounts and financial statements \nwithin the due date. A formal warning will be issued for accounts more than 6 months overdue \nand disbursements will be suspended for accounts that are more than 12 months overdue. \n \n53.  MWRLR, through the PMO, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports \nwill indicate progress made and problems encountered during the period under review, steps \ntaken to remedy the problems, the proposed program of activities, and expected progress \nduring the remaining implementation period. MWRLR will also provide such other reports and \ninformation relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request, including the Project\u2019s \nenvironmental impacts, dialogue with beneficiaries, and any social issues relating to the Project. \nWithin 3 months after physical completion of the Project, MWRLR will submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report detailing information on project implementation, use of the loan proceeds, and \nthe extent to which the objectives of the Project have been accomplished.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n54.  To monitor the progress of physical works, the Project provides for a comprehensive \nsystem of performance monitoring and evaluation (para. 39). An M&E unit will be established to \nmonitor project performance, including environmental, poverty, gender, and social impacts as \nspecified  in  the  summary  initial  environmental  examination  and  the  poverty  and  social \nassessment,  and  the  progress  of  various  reform  measures  introduced  under  the  Project, \naccording to the specific monitoring indicators described in the project framework (Appendix 1). \nThe TA accompanying the loan will monitor progress of  policy reforms in the project areas, and \ntheir impact on farm productivity/profitability, financial gains, farmers\u2019 incentives, etc.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n55.  The Project will be reviewed regularly by ADB missions. During the third year of project \nimplementation, the Government and ADB will carry out a midterm review to assess the \nachievement of project objectives. Project objectives will be measured against the performance \ncriteria listed in Appendix 1. The parameters for assessing the implementation milestones will \ninclude (i) implementation status, (ii) design and construction standards, (iii) physical progress \nand  disbursements  in  relation  to  the  implementation  schedule,  (iv) performance  of  the \nconsultants and contractors, (v) status of compliance with loan covenants, and (vi) status of \nachievement of the Project\u2019s development objectives. The midterm review will also assess the \nneed for changes in the project, and recommend measures to achieve project objectives. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n56.  The objectives of the TA Support for Monitoring Policy Reforms and Improving Farm and \nWater Management are to (i) monitor progress in implementing policy in the project areas; \n(ii) promote competitive providers of farm inputs, technical advice, credit, and marketing of \nproduce in the project areas; and (iii) assist the Government in establishing a WUA support unit \n. ", "14    \nwithin MWRLR. The TA will provide comprehensive monitoring, evaluation, and reporting on \nprogress being made by the Government toward its commitments to accelerate land reform, \nfarm  privatization,  and  farm  debt  resolution,  based  on  feedback  from  community  and \nnongovernment  organizations  and  elected  representatives.  The  TA  component  for  the \nalternative business providers will focus on (i) analyzing the strengths and limitations of existing \nbusiness  providers  beyond  the  services  offered  by  traditional  investors,  and  (ii) providing \ncapacity building for selected providers to expand their services to farmers in the project areas. \nThe TA assistance for the WUA support unit will focus on (i) defining the support unit\u2019s mandate, \norganizational  structure,  functions,  staffing  pattern,  and  legal  status;  and  (ii) providing \ninstitutional strengthening and technical advice to ensure that the support unit can properly \noperate in a sustainable manner. A grant of $500,000 equivalent17 financed by  ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program will provide the services of 12 person-months of international and 37 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants.18 MWRLR will be the EA for the TA, which will be implemented \nover a period of 24 months, starting in 2006. The implementation will be divided into two \nphases\u2014preparation and capacity building. Details of the TA are shown in Appendix 8. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n1.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n \n57.   Economic and financial analyses were carried out to assess the economic viability and \nsustainability of the Project, and the financial viability of the participating farms. The main \nquantifiable benefits of the investment come from (i) preventing the loss of production that may \noccur due to further deterioration of I&D facilities without the Project; and (ii) modest increases \nin yields and cropping intensity resulting from more reliable irrigation water supply, improved \nseed quality, reduced pests and disease, and improved cropping technologies.  \n \n58.  Without the Project, declining water supply and increasingly inefficient pumps will have a \nnegative impact on crop yields and the area cultivated. In the pump irrigation areas, the average \nyield for cotton will decline from the present level of 1.3 t/ha to around 1.1 t/ha, and wheat yields \nwill decline from 2.5 t/ha to 2.2 t/ha. In the gravity-supplied areas, yield declines of cotton and \nwheat will be slight. With the Project, in the pump irrigation areas, the average cotton yield will \nincrease to about 1.9 t/ha and the wheat yield will increase to 3.3 t/ha. In the gravity areas, \ncotton yields will increase to 2.0 t/ha and wheat yields will increase to around 3.5 t/ha. The \nannual output of cotton will increase from 38,700 t to 47,700 t and wheat production will rise \nfrom 26,800 t to 32,400 t by the eighth year after implementation. These are conservative \nassumptions compared with best practices in the area.19 \n \n59.  Benefits also accrue from the reduction in pumping costs for water in the pump irrigation \narea and savings of maintenance costs of the rehabilitated systems. The greater efficiency of \nnew pumps and the conversion of the upper areas of the Asht cascade to gravity supply will \n                                                 \n17  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent. The Government, through in-kind contributions, will \nfinance $125,000 equivalent. \n18  International consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nArrangements satisfactory to ADB will be used for the engagement of domestic consultants. Simplified technical \nproposals and ADB's quality- and cost-based selection system will be used.  \n19  The assumed yields for cotton in the future with this Project are attainable given that current best practices in the \ndistricts achieve up to 3.2 t/ha for cotton and generally achieve 50% or more on the above current district average \nyields. \n   ", "  15 \n \nreduce the energy cost of pumping by an estimated $1,312,500 per year (in economic prices). \nRehabilitation of headworks, canal structures, and sediment basins will reduce O&M costs by an \nestimated $191,200 per year. Proper O&M for the pumping stations will require an increase in \nexpenditures from the current level of about $44,000 per year with the Project. \n \n60.  The rehabilitation of rural water supply schemes has been assessed separately using \nthe time savings method developed by ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department. The \nschemes will improve the access of selected villages to a safe water supply and will have health \nbenefits as well as save time spent collecting water. The results of this analysis are consistent \nwith all five schemes having an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) greater than 12%. \n \n61.  The EIRR of the Project is 20.7% and the economic net present value (NPV) at the \ndiscount rate of 12% is $9.9 million. The EIRR of the individual district subprojects varies from \n13.5% in Rushon to 26.1% in Farkhor. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRR is robust, \nabove 12%, despite adverse effects of price and yield declines, benefit delays, and investment \ncost increases. The farm budget analyses for large and small farms and household plots in each \ndistrict indicate that farm incomes at all levels will increase with the Project.  \n \n62.  A  benefit  distribution  and  poverty  impact  analysis  was  carried  out.  The  economic \nbenefits are distributed among the three main stakeholder groups with $0.4 million to farm \nhouseholds, $7.0 million to  dekhan20 farms, and $2.4 million to the Government. A poverty \nimpact ratio of 69% was calculated, indicating that $6.8 million of the economic benefits accrue \nto the poor. Detailed economic and financial analyses is shown in Appendix 9.  \n \n63.  The effect of the intended policy initiatives21 has not been taken into account in the \nfinancial and economic analyses. However, the implementation of the reform agenda will further \nincrease the projected with-project benefits, and empower private farmers to improve farm \nfinancing, management, marketing of produce, and profitability.  \n \n2.    Impact on Environment \n \n64.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was conducted during project preparation. \nThe IEE confirms that the Project will result in significant positive environmental impacts. The \nProject does not involve construction of new canals, and will not expand irrigated areas, or \npumping capacity. The rehabilitation of I&D systems and improved water efficiency will reduce \nland degradation from salinity buildup and soil erosion. Coupled with the improvement of rural \nwater supply, the Project addresses two of six major environmental problems in Tajikistan.22  \n \n65.  None of the project components is located within a protected area. The ecosystem in the \nproject areas have been extensively modified and as a result both terrestrial and aquatic \nbiodiversity is considered to have been much reduced since the beginning of accelerated \nagricultural  and  industrial  development  in  the  1950s.23 Measures  have  been  proposed  to \nmitigate minor potential negative impacts identified in the IEE. Of these impacts, the most \ncrucial is related to fish movement upstream from the proposed weir on the Kofarnihon river, \nand the integration of measures to avoid fish entrainment in the rehabilitated intakes. Further \nstudy  will  be  undertaken  during  project  implementation.  Mitigation  measures  as  well  as \n                                                 \n20  Dekhan farms are privately owned small farms typically based on nuclear or extended families.  \n21  Including farm privatization, removal of interference by the Government in farm operations, inputs sourcing and \nmarketing, and provision of tradable land use rights to farmers in the project areas. \n22  ADB. 2003. Draft Tajikistan Country Environmental Analysis. Manila. \n23  Due to large-scale hydropower, mining, and logging projects. \n. ", "16    \nenvironmental management and monitoring have been integrated into the project design and \ncosts. \n \n3.    Impact on Living Standards \n \na.  Poverty Reduction \n \n66.  The Project will contribute to reduction in income-based poverty by improving farm \nhousehold  incomes  through  increased  farm  productivity  and  increasing  employment \nopportunities. To address this type of poverty, the Project will improve the reliability of irrigation \nwater supplies to 47,500 ha of irrigated land and ensure better, cheaper, and timely access to \nagricultural inputs. These will benefit 153,000 poor people, generate an increase of 41% in \ndekhan farm incomes and 33% in household plots incomes. Increased agricultural outputs \n(cotton by 23% and wheat by 21%) will lead to increased rural incomes. Improved agricultural \nactivities will spur the demand for labor estimated at 750,000 labor-days. As illustrated by the \ndistribution analysis, the Project\u2019s economic benefits will accrue more to the poor households \nthan other beneficiary groups. Sustained income benefits for poor households will also translate \ninto a decrease, in the medium term, in the incidence of poverty in the project areas by 5%. The \nbenefits accrue at these levels immediately after providing a reliable source of water for \nirrigation even without institutional reforms being in place. Once such reforms are implemented, \nthe benefits, especially those for the poor, will be even greater. \n \n67.  Nonincome-based poverty in rural Tajikistan is also closely related to the lack of clean \ndrinking water. The Project will address this issue by rehabilitating rural water supply systems, \nand 5,150 poor households will benefit from new potable water supplies. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \nb.  Gender and Development \n \n68.  An estimated 18% of total households in Tajikistan are headed by women. In rural areas, \nthat percentage increases dramatically. In many rural households, women have the dual roles of \nboth caregiver and breadwinner, as many men have migrated to Russia to find employment. As \nmany of the men do not send remittances to their families from Russia, the women often have to \nearn income and care for the children at the same time. Women traditionally work in the social \nand agriculture sectors, where wages are five to eight times lower than salaries in industrial and \nconstruction sectors.  \n \n69.  The Project will improve women's access to food and income-generating activities, and \ndecrease their vulnerability to waterborne diseases. The Project will ensure that female-headed \nfarms in project areas are WUA members and that women are fully represented in project \ndesign, planning, and implementation meetings. Women will make up at least 30% of the local \nwater  supply  committees  and  they  will  be  provided  with  training  in  rural  water  supply \nmanagement. Women will be also trained in new agricultural practices. A gender action plan is \nshown in Appendix 11. The Project will not have any adverse impact on ethnic minorities and \nwill not activate ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples.  \n \nc.  Improved Rural Institutions \n \n70.  The Project will explicitly tie or link the physical improvement in irrigation and rural water \nsupply  systems  with  institutional  development.  Rural  institutions  to  be  established  and \ndeveloped  include  (i) WUAs  focusing  on  improved  irrigation  management  and  O&M, \n   ", "  17 \n \n(ii) participatory water supply committees responsible for long-term O&M of the rehabilitated \nrural water supply systems, (iii) women's groups focusing not only on women-specific activities \nbut broadening the opportunities for women to participate in project activities, and (iv) informal \nassociations of independent farmers formed to take advantage of economies of scale. \n \nd.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n71.  There  will  be  limited  new  construction  under  the  Project.  A  settling  basin  will  be \nconstructed, on government land near the main canal in Khatlon region. Nine households \nwithout title or permission to use the land are presently cultivating approximately 6.5 ha of \ngovernment land at the potential settling basin site. The household members are not living at \nthe site, but only cultivating land. No structures, therefore, would have to be moved or replaced. \nThe size of the settling basin requires less than half of the land potentially available for \nconstruction, and therefore a more advantageous location could be selected, based on detailed \ntopographic surveys. Nevertheless, a short resettlement plan has been developed (Appendix \n12) to adequately address and compensate these households, ensuring that their livelihood will \nnot be negatively affected by the construction.  \n \n72.  In Asht district, the construction of a drinking water reservoir will require a village road to \nbe moved slightly using vacant government land. Additionally, it is possible that a small edge of \na household fence, involving an area of less than 5.0 square meter (m2), may also have to be \nmoved,  thus,  only  a  short  resettlement  plan  is  required.  Specific  assurances  have  been \nobtained from the Government that, should any resettlement become unavoidable (para. 80), \nthe Government will ensure that land acquisition is carried out in accordance with all applicable \nlaws and regulations of the Borrower, and with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. \n \ne.  Governance and Anticorruption \n \n73.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the Government. \nAttention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, \nparticularly on the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors to observe the highest standards \nof ethics in procurement and execution of ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud \nand corruption are discovered. A monitoring system will be established under the associated TA \nto, among other things, promote transparency in contract awarding and monitor the execution of \ncontracts. \n \nB.  Risks and Safeguards  \n \n74.  The Project will be ADB\u2019s third investment project implemented by MWRLR, which has \ndemonstrated adequate implementation capacity in the past. Thus the risk of implementation \ndelays  arising  from  MWRLR\u2019s  unfamiliarity  with  ADB  procedures  is  low.  For  the  Project, \nMWRLR staff have been closely involved in the project processing, and their understanding and \nknowledge of the Project will also minimize the risk of initial implementation delays that are \ncommonly observed in ADB projects. \n \n75.  The risk of the rehabilitated I&D schemes not being maintained adequately is significant. \nThe Government does not have the financial resources to ensure sustainable O&M, without \nrelying on recovery of irrigation service fees from beneficiaries. The Project addresses this risk \nby  (i) helping  develop  participatory  management  of  I&D  systems  through  WUAs,  and \n(ii) assisting MWRLR implement an improved cost recovery policy. In addition, the project \nschemes have been selected for low O&M costs; design and procurement of equipment will be \n. ", "18    \nbased on energy efficiency; and differential irrigation service fees will be introduced for lift and \ngravity schemes. Specific assurances in these areas have been obtained from the Government; \ndetails of the proposed O&M arrangements are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n76.  For the farmers to take full advantage of improved and secured irrigation water supply \nand turn this into improved productivity, they need to access technologies through sustainable \ninstitutional arrangements. The Project addresses the risk of a technology gap  by providing \nimmediate TA through demonstration farms (para. 36), and by accelerating private sector entry \ninto farm support services (para. 57). \n \n77.  The policy reforms to be implemented under the Project is ambitious, particularly in \naddressing the vested interests of local authorities, cotton investors, and the local government-\nappointed farm managers. To implement the reforms, the Government needs a high level of \npolitical commitment. If the reforms are not implemented properly in a comprehensive manner, \nrural poverty may significantly deepen\u2014perhaps in the form of further accumulation of farm \ndebts. On the other hand, if the reforms are implemented too rapidly, cotton investors may \ndecide to stay out of business, thereby effectively taking away the livelihood of many cotton \nfarm workers. To address these risks, the Project will establish an open and participatory forum, \nincluding farmers, local authorities, development partners, civil society, and cotton investors, to \nregularly review and assess the progress and impacts of reforms. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n78.  The Government has given the following specific assurances, which are incorporated in \nthe legal documents: \n \n(i)  Preconstruction works.  The Borrower will ensure that desilting of canals and \ndrains within the project schemes is carried out, and will provide budgetary \nallocation to ensure that these works will be completed before the award of civil \nworks contracts financed by the Project.   \n(ii)  Environment. (a) The Project will be carried out, and all facilities constructed, \noperated,  maintained,  and  monitored,  in  accordance  with  the  existing  laws, \nregulations, and standards of the Borrower concerning environmental protection, \nand ADB\u2019s environment policy; and (b) the Borrower will ensure that MWRLR \nimplements the environmental mitigation measures and monitoring requirements \nas outlined in the IEE. Further, the Borrower will assure that an appropriate \nbudgetary  allocation  (including  vehicles,  material  and  equipment,  operating \nexpenses, and staff) is provided by MWRLR and the State Committee of Nature \nProtection  and  Forestry  to  fulfill  their  responsibilities  for  implementation  of \nmitigation measures and monitoring requirements as outlined in the IEE. \n(iii)  Resettlement. The Borrower will ensure that involuntary resettlement under the \nProject,  if  any,  including  loss  of  crops,  land,  other  resources/assets,  is \nundertaken in conformity with a resettlement plan to be prepared by the Borrower \nin accordance with ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement. The compensation \nto the persons affected by the resettlement will make them as well off as they \nwould be in the absence of the Project. The resettlement plan will be updated, \nbased on detailed designs, and it will be disclosed to all affected persons in a \nform and language that they can understand, and it will be submitted with the \nEA's endorsement to ADB for review and approval before any civil works contract \nis awarded.  \n   ", "  19 \n \n(iv)  Gender  and  development.  The  Borrower  will  start,  within  1  year  of  loan \neffectiveness, implementation of the gender action plan outlined in the summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy. The Borrower will ensure that (a) the \nfemale-headed farms in project areas are WUA members and that women are \nfully represented in project planning and  implementation meetings; (b) women \nwill make up at least 30% of the local water supply committees; and (c) women \nwill participate in all activities in the core demonstration areas and will be trained \nin new agricultural practices. \n(v)  Operation and maintenance, water service fees, and fee collection in the \nproject  areas.  (a) The Borrower will provide adequate budgetary allocation, \nincluding that needed to cover the transition period up to full cost recovery and \ncollection of the irrigation service fees; (b) the Borrower will issue a resolution, \nnot later than 31 December 2007, to set differential irrigation service fees for lift \nand gravity irrigation schemes. These fees will be increased gradually until they \nfully cover the cost of O&M of the irrigation facilities by 31 December 2010, in line \nwith the Borrower's agreement with the World Bank; (c) the Borrower will provide \nadequate budgetary allocation, including that needed to cover the transition \nperiod up to full cost recovery and collection of the irrigation service fees; and \n(d) the Borrower will formulate, with the assistance of the Project, a potable water \nsupply cost recovery and fee structure based on assessment of ability to pay, \nespecially of poor farm households, and will, not later than 31 December 2008, \nimplement such a policy. \n(vi)  Water  user\u2019s  associations  and  water  supply  committees  in  the  project \nareas. Within 3 years of loan effectiveness, the Borrower will ensure that WUAs \nand water supply committees are established in the project areas, and that the \nWUAs will assume the responsibilities to carry out the O&M of the on-farm I&D \nfacilities after they are fully organized and trained, but not later than 2 years after \nrehabilitation of their infrastructure is complete. \n(vii)  Cotton financing and marketing. Not later than 31 December 2006, (a) the \nBorrower will insure that Presidential Decree No. 899 of 23 September 2002 be \nstrictly  implemented  by  the  regional  and  district  level  administrations  in  the \nProject area to abolish planning target for cotton production, which sets both the \narea of farm land for producing cotton and the quantity of fiber to be produced; \n(b) the Borrower, in consultation with ADB, develop and implement mechanism to \nensure that the farm-gate prices for raw cotton will be linked to world prices for \ncotton  fiber;  the  fixed  export  price  for  cotton  fiber  will  be  changed  from  a \nmaximum to a minimum price; and  these prices will be published/made available \nto  the  public;  (c) within  the  project  areas  the  Borrower  will  ensure  that,  in \naccordance  with  Presidential  Decree  No.  899  of  23  September  2002  and \nResolution No. 412 of 22 October 1999, the regional and district administration \nwill permit financing by multiple cotton investors,  ensure that ginning services \nare not restricted by administrative boundaries, and permit the movement of raw \ncotton  across  the  administrative  boundaries  for  ginning  and  marketing;  and \n(d) the Borrower will, with the assistance of the TA for Support for Monitoring \nPolicy Reforms and Improving Farm and Water Management, develop standard \ncotton  financing  and  production  contracts  to  ensure  introduction  of  financial \ndisciplines and appropriate allocation of rights, benefits, responsibilities, and risks \namong the concerned parties. The Borrower will submit such draft standard \ncontracts for ADB\u2019s review and, after ADB\u2019s approval, implement these contracts \nin the project areas.  \n \n.

Introduction \n1.  The agriculture sector resource base covers some 4.07 million hectares (ha) of which \n3.3 million ha are permanent pastures. The cultivated area is about 0.84 million ha of which \n0.72 million ha are irrigated. Agricultural production is dominated by cotton and wheat, which \ntogether account for around 75% of total cultivated area, and provide employment for more than \n50% of the country\u2019s labor force. The sector generates about 30% of export revenues and 35% \nof  tax  revenues.  Since  independence  from  the  former  Soviet  Union,  allocating  sufficient \nresources to maintain rural infrastructure, including the irrigation systems, has been difficult for \nthe Government and there has been extensive deterioration. \n \n2.  During the 1990s, Tajikistan experienced significant increases in the levels of poverty, \nespecially in rural areas. The Government recognizes the need to reduce poverty and increase \nincomes. The target stated in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper1 is to reduce the poverty \nlevel from 83% in 1999 to 60% in 2015.2  Since the majority of the poor are in rural areas, these \nobjectives cannot be achieved without effective measures to increase agricultural output and \npromote agricultural employment. As part of its development strategy, the Government is \ncommitted to  (i) rehabilitation of key irrigation facilities, (ii) improving the efficiency of irrigation \nwater  use,  (iii) continuing  farm  reorganization,  (iv) developing  a  rural  credit  system,  and \n(v) implementing a poverty reduction program with a substantial agriculture sector component. \n \nB.  Sector Performance \n \n1.  Agriculture and Land  \n \n3.  During the 1990s, performance in the agriculture sector was characterized by a decline \nin the area, yields, and output of the key cotton crop and by an increase in the area and output \nof  cereals.  In  many  areas,  food  security  became  of  overriding  importance.  Agricultural \nproductivity is also well below pre-independence levels with average cotton yields  currently \n1.7 t/ha compared with 2.8 t/ha before independence. Wheat yields are also low at an average \nof 1.3 t/ha. During the same period, the number of people employed in rural areas rose by over \n32%, but much of this employment is intermittent or part time and underemployment in the \nsector is high. \n \n4.  Land remains the property of the state and families either individually or collectively are \ngiven  land  use  rights,  which  are  heritable  but  not  tradable.  These  limitations  restrict  the \nevolution of commercial agriculture. The lack of clear procedures under the existing Law on \nDekhan Farms adopted in 1992 for land allocation to private farmers and for dispute settlement \nresulted in local authorities\u2019 use of these procedures being viewed as arbitrary. To remove these \nflaws, the Parliament amended the law in 2002. By the end of 2002, the State Land Committee \nhad transformed some 500 state farms into dekhan farms3 but the related land tenure rights \nremain weak and can be rescinded by local authorities. Only 10% of rural families have direct \n                                                 \n1  The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was approved by the Majlisi Oli (Parliament) of the Republic of \nTajikistan on 19 June 2002. \n2  Based on the government-defined poverty level in 1999 of Tajik Somoni 20 per person per month. Appendix 10: \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy contains a summary of the poverty rates estimated for Tajikistan. \n3  Dekhan farms are collectively owned farms based on nuclear or extended families. \n. ", "26      Appendix  2 \ncontrol  over  land  assets  other  than  household  plots.4 Many  structural,  legal,  and political \nimpediments prevent a comprehensive implementation of land reform and much of Tajikistan's \nrural land is managed and operated by collective  dekhan farms, joint stock companies, or \ncooperative production farms, which are little different in operation to the old state farms. \n \n5.  Since 1997, many farms have accumulated significant amounts of debt, which is linked \nto the financing of cotton, using the crop as collateral.5  More than 70% of farm debt is \nconcentrated within 108 farms that have never repaid any cotton loans.6  These collective \ndekhan farms have been reorganized in such a way during the land reform process that any \neconomic incentives to improve performance have been minimized. For this type of farm, the \nfarm managers are largely unaccountable to the members (who are responsible for repayment \nof the debt). Debt levels are now high enough in many cases to provide a further disincentive to \nproduction and are placing a constraint on the further development of irrigated agriculture. Along \nwith policy reforms, it has been proposed by the recently conducted study (technical assistance \n[TA] 4052-TAJ: Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms) that a financial restructuring of the \nunprofitable farms be undertaken to resolve this problem.  \n \n6.  The proposed debt resolution strategy is based on the premise that the solution to farm \ndebt is profitable farms. The main contention of the recent study is that the number of profitable \nfarms will not increase without major restructuring of the existing collective dekhan farms and \nwithout substantial policy reforms to create an appropriate commercial environment for farm \nenterprises to grow. \n \n7.  Many existing farms as well as newly organized  dekhan farms suffer from a lack of \naccess to supplies of inputs (including credit) at competitive prices, and technical extension \nservices. The inputs provided by the cooperative dekhan farms can be twice as expensive as \ninputs purchased in the markets, and often the inputs are provided late. Independent dekhan \nfarms, on the other hand, are free to purchase inputs they want in local markets at competitive \nprices, although the lack of alternative sources of credit can affect the production activities of \nthese farms and act as a constraint against achieving higher output levels. \n \n8.  Proposed policy reforms for farm debt resolution include (i) farm management reforms to \nrestructure  collective  farms  into  smaller  manageable  farms  with  farm  managers  who  are \naccountable to their members; (ii) government reforms to stop issuing cotton production targets; \n(iii) enacting legislation for land registration and leasehold rights; (iv)  reforms on recognition of \nland and leases as collateral, implementation of loan classification, and investors accepting \nliability for trade credit; (v) cotton processing and marketing reforms to reduce the costs of \ncotton exports, force ginneries to compete for raw material supplies and allow open pricing of \ncotton sales; and (vi) irrigation finance to ensure pricing of water delivery reflects its true costs.  \n \n9.  Due to the lack of funding and personnel, there is no formal agricultural extension \nservice in Tajikistan. At the district level, agricultural offices try to provide some agricultural \nextension and advice, but they have limited resources. At the field level, farmers receive little \nsystematic  information  on  agricultural  inputs,  markets  or  improved  water  management \n                                                 \n4  These and most other land reform issues are being addressed by ongoing World Bank projects, the recently \ncompleted Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms TA, some bilateral agencies, and by Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO)-led coordination group monitoring the land reform process. \n5  During this period, cotton credit has been almost the only source of working capital available to farms and some \nfarm managers freely admit that some of the funds have been used to finance crops other than cotton. \n6  The TA for Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms (TA 4052-TAJ) has recently completed a detailed study of \nthis issue. \n   ", "Appendix  2   27 \n \ntechniques. Independent dekhan farmers may seek advice and information from any source but \nthose linked to collective dekhan farms have few options to pursue information and extension \nadvice. The World Bank has established a National Agricultural Training Center, and trainees \nfrom the center have begun setting up extension services. Improving access to these services \ncould increase productivity by helping farmers to (i) improve crop yields, (ii) intensify their crop \nrotations, and (iii) diversify their cropping to achieve higher revenues. \n \n2.  Water Management \n10.  Water resources management systems in Tajikistan have not changed significantly since \nthe Soviet period but as agriculture evolves from the former centrally  directed model to one \nwhere farmers have greater freedom to manage resources these management systems are no \nlonger appropriate.  \n11.  Water users\u2019 associations (WUAs) are increasingly providing water management roles \nand performing on-farm operation and maintenance (O&M). Under the old Soviet system, the \ncollective and state farms acted as the \"middlemen\" between the large government ministries \nsupplying water and the field level application of water. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, \nthat link or connection between water supply and demand was broken, and there is now a large \ngap (almost a black hole) between the \"big water\" suppliers at the ministry, and the \"small \nwater\" users at the field level. Farm water management at  the field level is a vital part of \nimproved irrigation management, but it is a neglected area in Tajikistan's irrigation systems. \n12.  Rehabilitation  of  irrigation  systems  is  linked  to  the  cost  of  maintaining  them.  The \nGovernment\u2019s ability to support the cost of O&M is limited and irrigation service fees were \ntherefore introduced in 1996. Irrigation service fees depend on the volume nominally supplied \nand so depend on the crop grown. The tariff is currently TJS6 ($2) per 1,000 m3, although the \ngeneral  lack  of  measuring  and  metering  installations  precludes  the  proper  application  of \nvolumetric irrigation service fees.7  Irrigation service fees are uniform across the country and do \nnot differentiate between gravity and pump irrigation schemes even though energy costs in \npump irrigation schemes typically account for at least two thirds of total O&M costs. The water \nfees at the current level are almost sufficient to cover off-farm O&M costs, excluding the costs of \noperating and maintaining pump stations. In 2003, reported expenditures on off-farm O&M were \nabout $5 per ha, compared with an estimated requirement for gravity schemes of $5.6 per ha. \nThe total O&M costs for pumping, at the current electricity tariff, are about twice the total cost for \nthe gravity schemes. Increasing cost recovery through water fees or payment in kind using \ncommunity labor is the only possible long-term solution for meeting O&M costs and sustaining \nthe irrigation system. \n \nC.  Sector Institutions \n \n1.  Legal Basis \n13.  The Water Code is the legal basis for resource management at present but requires \nrevision to accommodate the concept of basin-wide water resources management and water \nallocation across sectors. It also needs to be amended to recognize explicitly the role of water \nas an economic good. Although the Water Code provides for the formation of WUAs, it needs to \n                                                 \n7  In a number of locations, the MWRLR and its line offices have begun to introduce measuring devices on the tertiary \ndistribution system, for example in parts of the Asht-2 cascade. A Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation \n(SDC) project, Integrated Water Resources Management in Fergana Valley, is also introducing measuring devices \nin pilot areas. \n. ", "28      Appendix  2 \nbe updated to promote and safeguard their specific requirements through the incorporation of \nappropriate legal provisions.8  \n \n2.  National Institutions \n14.  The Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR) plays a key role in \nthe system of water resources administration of Tajikistan. In particular, it is responsible for the \nconstruction and O&M of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, and river regulation works. A \nnumber of other agencies also hold some water management responsibilities, with monitoring \nand water management for energy generation being key areas where responsibilities are \nshared.9 \n \n15.  The  fragmentation  of  responsibilities  in  the  water  resources  sector  and  a  lack  of \ncoordination  between  the  two  major  water  users  in  Tajikistan  limits  efficient  utilization  of \navailable water for both agriculture and power generation. To improve water resource utilization, \nthe Government needs to harmonize the conflicting water requirements of the major users. A \nriver basin or watershed management approach to water resources utilization has generally \nbeen accepted by MWRLR as the most appropriate approach to water resources utilization and \nmanagement. A river basin management approach also implies an institutional framework, \nwhich would also redefine the role of MWRLR as either a bulk water supplier or as a regulatory \nauthority.10  \n \n16.  The responsibilities of the Ministry of Agriculture include the development of agriculture, \nensuring the efficiency of land use and the preservation of the quality of agricultural land. The \nministry develops cotton production targets and schedules for oblasts and raions, which provide \nthe basis for annual irrigation plans prepared at the farm level and approved by MWRLR and its \nregional and district offices. The ministry also controls the transportation, storage and use of \nchemical fertilizers and herbicides for cotton production and determines the content of residual \nquantity of pesticides in water and soil. A major weakness in the sector is that there is no overall \nagricultural sector strategy and therefore a lack of direction in programs and activities. \n \n3.  Local Institutions \n17.  At  the  regional  and  district  levels,  MWRLR\u2019s  regional  (oblvodkhoz)  and  district \n(raivodkhoz) offices are responsible for the development and distribution of water resources and \nfor the construction and O&M of the I&D networks, from system headworks down to farm \nboundaries. The district offices make agreements with farms and WUAs for the delivery of \nwater, but these agreements only mention the volume of water to be delivered and make no \nreference to the timing of deliveries.  \n \n18.  At the district level the Ministry of Agriculture is represented by the Department of \nAgriculture within the Hukumat (administrative offices) and the first deputy of the Hukumat is \nalways responsible for agricultural matters within the local administration. The role of the \n                                                 \n8  A detailed review of the legal and institutional aspects of water management in Tajikistan has been prepared by the \nTACIS/EuropeAid funded project Aral Sea Water Resources Management Project (ASWERAM: Project 30560: \nDevelopment of effective integrated water resources management in pilot sub-catchments of the Aral Sea basin). \n9  To detail the provision of the Water Code, the Government has progressively adopted a series of decisions \n(postanovlenye) calling, in turn, for ministerial orders (prekaz) and instructions (instruktsia) for their implementation. \nA list of the water-related legislation in force is shown on Table 1.2, Supplementary Appendix L.  \n10 The report on Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms (TA 4052-TAJ) contains a comprehensive analysis of \nwater sector institutional issues. Annex 6 on Water Resources Management, Finances, and Institutions presents an \noverview of the sector, an analysis of existing institutions, and recommendations for institutional changes. \n   ", "Appendix  2   29 \n \ndepartment is essentially one of planning and coordination of production. It does not include, for \nexample, any extension or  technical service for crop production. Under the former system, \ntechnical inputs were provided by specialists attached to the sovkhozes and kolkhozes or by \nresearch institutes. In the post-independence period, this system has collapsed and while the \nMinistry of Agriculture retains its planning and managerial function, the provision of technical \nservices to the sector has largely collapsed. \n \nD.  Sector Challenges  \n19.  The  principal  challenges  facing  the  agriculture  and  water  sectors  are  to  increase \nagricultural  production  to  benefit  all  farm  households  through  increased  farm  productivity, \ngreater  employment  opportunities,  higher  incomes,  and  increased  food  security.  Irrigation \ninfrastructure is a key element in the rural economy but has deteriorated extensively due to the \ncivil conflict and the lack of resources for adequate O&M and investment. Key areas for the \nfuture are the O&M and sustainability of irrigation infrastructure, farmer participation in irrigation \nmanagement, the reduction of farm debt and increased access to credit, improved agricultural \nsupport services, and an incentive structure for promoting increased production. In order to \nprovide  the  resources  for  continuing  maintenance  of  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems, \nappropriate scales of payment for water delivery services need to be established, and regular \npayment of these fees assured. \n \n20.  TA linked to the loan will provide for the establishment of a WUA support unit within \nMWRLR and  the institutionalization of water user groups as an accepted part of the overall \nmanagement of water resources. The TA will also identify measures that can be taken to \nenhance and strengthen the role of the private sector in the provision of input and output \nservices to the agriculture sector. \n \n21.  The Government has already made considerable progress toward the establishment of \nmore sustainable policies for land, agriculture, and water and it is committed to furthering this \nprocess  and  enhancing  the  performance  of  the  agriculture  and  water  sectors  to  improve \nincomes  and  reduce  rural  poverty.  The  Project  will  support  this  objective  through  the \nrehabilitation of essential irrigation infrastructure in five project areas.  \n22.  Though many rural institutions are weak, there is wide acknowledgement from both \ngovernment and development partners that change is needed, not least of which is the growing \nrealization that institutional strengthening must go hand in hand with physical rehabilitation. It is \nanticipated that WUAs will take on increasing importance in Tajikistan's farm water management \nand O&M. Likewise, village-based organizations developing potable water supply systems need \ninstitutional  strengthening,  to  ensure  long-term  O&M  and  financial  viability.  Agricultural \ninstitutions need to be refocused on the needs of the farmers, and providing services to farmers, \nrather than meeting the needs of larger external investors. The rural poor, especially vulnerable \ngroups such as women, also require institutional support and active participation in all project \nactivities. The Project will explicitly provide institutional capacity building in these sectors, to \nensure the long-term institutional and financial viability of rural institutions. \n.

Introduction \n1.  This  summary  initial  environmental  (SIEE)  examination  includes  an  assessment  of \nenvironmental benefits, adverse effects, and recommended mitigation and monitoring measures \nrelated to the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project in Tajikistan.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The objective of the Project is to increase the income of rural communities through: (i) \nprovision of reliable irrigation supplies in the project areas, (ii) improved farm productivity, (iii) \nimproved access to safe water for targeted rural communities, and (iv) policy reforms supporting \nproject  implementation.  The  Project  will  be  located  in  five  districts  and  will  have  four \ncomponents:  (i) cost-effective  and  prioritized  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  and  drainage \ninfrastructure and support to improve water management covering 47,000 hectares (ha) with a \nrural beneficiary population of 246,000; (ii) improvement of rural water supply systems for \n53,000 beneficiaries; (iii) support to farmers for improved agricultural development with on-farm \ndemonstrations covering 500 ha; and (iv) project management, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n3.  The climate of Tajikistan is continental, with hot summers and cold winters. Rainfall is \nlow and occurs mainly in winter and spring. Lowland project areas are situated on sloping \nalluvial outwash fans or level valley floors below and in-between moderate to steeply sloping \nmountains. Soils are typically silty gray-brown desert soils of alluvial origin and relatively low \ninherent fertility. In some places loess (wind-blown) soils are irrigated; these are more fertile but \nsuffer from erosion where water is uncontrolled. Soil salinity is a problem in some locations due \nto high groundwater resulting from excess irrigation and/or poor drainage. One project area lies \nalong the Bartang river in the Pamirs, a tributary of the Panj river which forms the border with \nAfghanistan. Irrigation water supplies are all taken from surface water. Chemical water quality is \ngenerally good. Groundwater is fresh under the larger rivers, but can be saline elsewhere.  \n \n4.  Tajikistan\u2019s wide range of altitudes is home to a rich mixture of ecosystems and has rich \nbiodiversity, however, the ecosystems in project areas have been extensively modified in the \nlast 50 years.1 As a result, both terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity is considered to have been \nmuch reduced since the beginning of accelerated agricultural and industrial development in the \n1950s. The project areas are now commercial agricultural landscapes comprising cultivated \nfields, orchards and vineyards, mulberry and poplar plantations, roads, canals, drains, and built-\nup  areas  with  houses  and  gardens.  These  artificial  landscapes  provide  little  habitat  for \nendangered or threatened species. There are no protected areas within the project areas.  \n \n5.  The project areas are dependent on agriculture. The principal crop within the irrigation \nsystems is irrigated cotton. Most agricultural workers wages are extremely low and often unpaid \nor made in kind (cotton stalks for winter fuel). Household food security is dependent on \n                                                 \n1  This is due to large-scale projects for irrigation, especially for cotton, hydroelectricity, water reservoirs, mining, \nagricultural expansion, and logging. Industrial pollution, discharge of mining wastes, use of pesticides, and the \nconstruction of infrastructure for water resource development have had a particularly severe impact on aquatic and \nriparian ecosystems. The protracted civil war and economic problems that followed independence reduced \nindustrial  pollution  but  exacerbated  other  problems,  in  particular  uncontrolled  deforestation  for  fuelwood, \nagricultural expansion, hunting, and fires.  \n. ", "32      Appendix 4 \nhousehold plots, rain-fed winter wheat on former rangeland, limited domestic livestock, and \nremittances from male household members working seasonally in Russia. There are high \ndegrees of poverty in the project area, whose districts have all been classified as poor, very \npoor, or extremely poor in a recent national survey.2 The rural poor eat an inadequate diet, have \ninsufficient income or production to provide food for all seasons, and have low stocks of food. \nMalnutrition is widespread.  \n \n6.  Public  health  in  the  project  areas  is  affected  by  both  agricultural  practices  and \nproblematic drinking water supplies. Food insecurity encourages the expansion of wet rice \ncultivation  close  to  human  settlements,  which  provides  habitat  for  malaria-transmitting \nmosquitoes. Most piped water systems have fallen into disrepair. Many rural households now \ndepend on surface water, usually rivers or canals. This water is often of low bacteriological and \nchemical quality and, together with low levels of hygiene and high groundwater levels in human \nsettlements that adversely affects sanitation, contributes to the high levels of communicable \ndisease, especially amongst children. \n \nD.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n7.  Environmental  Benefits.  The  Project  will  have  significant  positive  environmental \nimpacts primarily through arrested land degradation due to salinity buildup and soil erosion in \nirrigated areas, and providing rural water supply in the project areas.3 The improvement of \nintake structures, construction of sedimentation basins, and provision of sediment handling \nequipment will reduce sediment entering the systems by 70%. The repair of canal lining and key \ncontrol structures, and the desilting of canals will result in restoration of canal capacity and a \nreduction in water losses thereby improving water availability. The revegetation of sand dunes \nwill prevent the deposition of saline wind-blown sand on pressure pipes. Desilting drains will \nimprove  the  drainage  system  reducing  waterlogging  and  secondary  soil  salinization.  The \nproblem of waterlogging affects not only agricultural areas but also human settlements resulting \nin higher groundwater, which adversely affects sanitation and causes public health problems.  \n \n8.  The Project will support sustainable agricultural development including the promotion of \nintegrated pest management. The Project will also support the establishment of on-farm water \nmanagement  demonstration  sites  in  each  project  area.  These  will  promote  the  use  of \ntechniques such as land leveling and precise irrigation applications, thus promoting improved \nwater use efficiency. Through the provision of safe water supply to rural communities, the \nProject is expected to result in significant positive impacts on public health, household workload, \nand quality of rural life. Significant positive impacts on agricultural development and productivity, \nrural incomes, institutional development, public health, and soil and water resources, brought by \nthe Project will enhance net environmental benefits. \n \n9.  Environmental  Issues  Related  to  Project  Location.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate \nexisting systems for irrigation water supply, which are based on diversion of river flows. There \nwill be no additional abstraction above preexisting levels except on one mountain stream and \ntherefore no change in river hydrology. The quality and volume of return flows are not expected \nto change measurably within the lifetime of the Project.4 The Project has been designed to avoid \n                                                 \n2  National Social Investment Fund for Tajikistan (NSIFT). 2002. Investment Plan for the Second Poverty Reduction \nProject. Dushanbe. \n3  These address two of the six major environmental problems in Tajikistan (ADB. 2003. Draft Tajikistan Country \nEnvironmental Analysis. Manila.) \n4  This assumes complementary activities will not result in significant changes in irrigation system operation and \nfarmer behavior. \n   ", "Appendix 4  33 \ninvoluntary resettlement and impacts due to conflicting land use or additional impediments to \nmovement of people and livestock. Resettlement impacts, if any, will be addressed through a \nshort resettlement plan in accordance with government regulations and approval procedures, as \nwell as Asian Development Bank (ADB) safeguard policies. \n \n10.  The settling basins proposed for rehabilitation and construction at canal intakes along \nthe Panj river are adjacent to wetlands in controlled zones along the border with Afghanistan. \nMeasures will be undertaken to minimize impacts on wetland habitats during construction. In \nRushon, Farkhor, and Panj districts irrigated areas are subject to bank erosion along the Panj \nriver. The Ministry of Emergency Situations and Civil Defense is undertaking bank protection \nworks in some of these areas. In Sughd region, gravity water supply to the eastern parts of the \nAsht irrigation scheme adjacent to the project areas is reported to be affected by inadequate \nirrigation releases from Uzbekistan despite an international water-sharing agreement. Improved \ncooperation should be sought. In Khatlon region, water is taken from the Panj river, which forms \nthe border with Afghanistan\u2014no additional diversion is considered and the status quo will not be \naltered by the Project. \n \n11.  All drinking water supplies will be from springs or groundwater. Water abstraction will be \nsmall scale and will not significantly affect local rivers or aquifers. All centralized water supplies \nwill be disinfected to avoid impacts from poor water quality. The Project will not cause conflicts \nin water use. \n \n12.  Environmental Issues Related to Project Design. The project areas rely on surface \nwater diversion for irrigation water supply. Major design issues are (i) management of flood \nflows  at  intakes,  (ii) capture  of  water  during  low  flows,  and  (iii) high  levels  of  suspended \nsediment. Project investments will be designed to resist flooding and erosion, and to cope with \nhigh  sediment  levels  and  variable  flows.  High  sediment  levels  are  a  major  burden  on \nmaintenance budgets, but can be reduced by providing settling basins at the main intakes. The \nProject will ensure that these structures are properly designed and will provide training to \nensure efficient operation. Projected return flows from the settling basins and from drainage will \nnot significantly alter downstream water quality either in terms of mineralization or sediment. \nThe  Project  will  assist  in  minimizing  irrigation  water  supply  conflicts  by  supporting  the \ndevelopment  of  government  capacity  to  promote  water  users\u2019  associations  (WUAs),  by \nimproving  the  reliability  of  the  supply  and  by  setting  up  on-farm  water  management \ndemonstration areas to promote increased water use efficiency. \n \n13.  Consistent with the provisions of the Water Code and associated decree number 437 \nissued in 2002, the Project will ensure that measures are undertaken to ensure adverse effects \non fish resources are mitigated. Of particular relevance to this is the proposed weir on the \nKofarnihon  river,  where  possible  negative  impacts  on  upstream  fish  movement  has  been \nidentified. The initial environmental examination (IEE) proposes a further study and integrate in \nthe Project the measures to avoid fish entrainment in intakes and pumps, if necessary. The \nproposed study has been included in the terms of reference for consulting services, and will be \nconducted jointly with the Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR) during \nthe initial state of project implementation. It will recommend appropriate mitigation measures \nproposing a fixed schedule for their implementation, and will be a precondition to the start of any \nrelated construction activity. \n \n14.  The  Project  will  promote  improved  seed  production,  multiplication,  and distribution. \nThese activities will not affect the limited existing agrobiodiversity or wild diversity. Tajikistan is \ndeveloping  policies  and  capacity  in  relation  to  genetically-modified organisms following its \n. ", "34      Appendix 4 \naccession to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The \nProject will operate in accordance with the Protocol.  \n \n15.  Environmental Issues Related to Construction Stage. The Project will not involve \nextensive earthworks on sloping ground, and is not expected to create erosion hazards. Existing \ngullying  in  Vahdat  district  will  be  dealt  with  through  structural  and  vegetative  measures. \nSediment from desilting operations in channels is nontoxic and will be disposed of in fields or \nother approved sites. All work in or near rivers will be carefully controlled to avoid localized \npollution from waste oils and spills of diesel. Work near the Panj river will require security \nclearance  from  the  border  security  force  and  formal  confirmation  from  Russian  military \nauthorities that the areas are clear of mines. \n \n16.  Health, safety, and environmental management standards during construction will be \nimproved by developing and enforcing relevant contract clauses. In addition to controlling solid \nand liquid waste disposal and site environmental management especially dust, these clauses \nwill  include  a  requirement  for  testing  oils  for  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs)  from  any \ntransformers removed from service, and their proper disposal. Careful attention will also be \ngiven to transparency in tendering and payment procedures and effective supervision on site. \nThe Project will also provide testing kits to local units of the Sanitary-Epidemiological Station to \nsupport drinking water source approval functions. \n \n17.  Environmental Issues Related to Project Operation. Flood damage to canal intakes \nwill be reduced by appropriate intake strengthening and design. Siltation of canals and sediment \ndamage to pumps will be reduced by providing settling basins. Silt from settling basins will either \nbe disposed of to waste land or flushed back to the main rivers. No significant impacts are \nexpected. Reduced siltation of canals will permit diversion of maintenance funds to desilting of \ndrainage channels, reducing groundwater levels and thereby reducing secondary salinization. \nPesticide and fertilizer use may increase if agricultural incomes rise; the Project will train \nfarmers in integrated pest management techniques and no significant negative impacts are \nexpected.  \n \n18.  A total of $112,000 or 0.4% of total project costs will be invested for implementing the \nrecommended mitigation measures, excluding consulting services. \n \nE.  Environmental Monitoring Program and Institutional Requirements  \n19.  A  monitoring  and  evaluation  unit  (MEU)  will  be  established  within  the  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  to  monitor  project  implementation,  performance,  and  impacts. \nConsultants will be engaged to provide further assessment of environmental impacts of project \ncomponents,  evaluate  environmental  monitoring  requirements,  and  prepare  a  long-term \nenvironmental monitoring program for the Project.5  \n                                                 \n5  The environmental monitoring program will have two components: environmental compliance monitoring focusing \non ensuring that physical investments are carried out in accordance with relevant clauses in contract documents \nand Government regulations; and environmental performance monitoring. Environmental performance monitoring \nwill cover: (i) key variables on each irrigation scheme (irrigation water quality, drainage water quality, depth to \ngroundwater, and soil quality); (ii) health, gender and other social impacts; and (iii) public involvement (through \ninput of local information by the WUAs and water supply committees). Additional consultants inputs of 2 person-\nmonths international and 4 person-months domestic, will reduce the risk of under-performance of environmental \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n   ", "Appendix 4  35 \n20.  It is recognized that it will be difficult to completely resolve the issues with respect to \nfisheries in the short term. However, as the precautionary principle states, \u201clack of full scientific \ncertainty will not be used as a reason for postponing  cost-effective measures to prevent \nenvironmental degradation.\u201d  The IEE proposes to conduct further study on the fisheries issues.  \nThe completion of this study, which will become an integral part of the detailed design, with \nrecommendations on appropriate mitigation measures, will become a precondition to start of \nany related construction activities. Consultants\u2019 inputs will be provided to assist in planning and \nexecuting the required fisheries studies, and consequent measures to be adopted.  Detailed \nterms of reference6, budget and an implementation schedule have been prepared.  \n21.  For sustainability, the Project\u2019s environmental monitoring program should be based on \nmaking maximum use of existing institutions and building on directly relevant initiatives such as \nthose undertaken under the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP). The ARP is supporting the \nState Committee for Nature Protection and Forestry (SCNPF) with about $100,000 to ensure \nregular monitoring of environmental impacts and mitigation measures. In addition, ADB has \nassisted the SCNPF with a 12-month institutional strengthening TA7 which included the supply \nof field monitoring equipment. The World Bank Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project has \nsupplied  equipment  and  training  to  the  central  laboratory  of  MWRLR\u2019s  specialized \nHydrogeological Amelioration Expedition for monitoring irrigation and drainage water quality.8  \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n22.  A significant level of public consultation was undertaken during project preparation. \nStakeholders at the central, regional, district, and project area levels were identified. Fieldwork \nfor poverty and social analysis sought the opinion of stakeholders including the conduct of a \nlarge  number  of  village-  and  farm-level  interviews.  A  household  survey  was  undertaken \ninvolving 200 respondents. Meetings were conducted with concerned government agencies at \nall administrative levels. Interviews were held with nongovernment organizations and farmers to \ncollect  data  and  identify  local  issues  and  priorities.  A  stakeholder  workshop  was  held  in \nDushanbe in July 2004 to obtain feedback on the proposals in the interim report and assist final \ndesign. All consultations supported the project interventions, which match clear district-level \npriorities. The stakeholder workshop was followed by meetings with the SCNPF to elicit their \ncomments on the IEE and to ensure that the Project followed the environmental regulations of \nTajikistan. During project implementation, public participation will be channeled through the \nWUAs and water supply committees. \n \nG.  Findings and Conclusions \n \n23.  The  Project  will  have  significant  positive  environmental  impacts,  primarily through \narrested land degradation that has been caused by salinity buildup and soil erosion in irrigated \nareas, and through providing rural water supply in the project areas\u2014major environmental \nissues  in  Tajikistan.  Findings  show  that  the  Project  will  have  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. Sufficient mitigation measures, and environmental management and \nmonitoring integrated into project design and cost, will address the small impacts identified. A \nfull-scale environmental impact assessment is not required. \n                                                 \n6   The detailed terms of reference for consulting services  is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n7  ADB. 2000.

Objectives and Scope \n1.  The objectives of the technical assistance (TA) are to (i) monitor progress made by the \nGovernment in implementing policy reforms that would create a conducive environment for \nproject  implementation;  (ii) promote  competitive  providers  of  farm  inputs,  technical  advice, \ncredit, and marketing of products in the selected project areas; and (iii) assist the Government in \nestablishing  a  water  users\u2019  association  (WUA)  support  unit  within  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR).  \n \n2.  The TA will provide regular monitoring and reporting on progress being made by the \nGovernment toward its commitments to meeting safeguards listed in the Loan Agreement, and \nalso provide an independent monitor of contract  award and implementation. The TA for the \nalternative business providers will focus on (i) analyzing the strengths and limitations of existing \nbusiness providers beyond the services offered by the traditional investors;1 and (ii) providing \ncapacity building for selected provider(s) to expand their services to private farmers in the \nproject areas. The TA support for the WUAs support unit will focus on (i) defining the unit\u2019s \nmandate,  organizational  structure,  functions,  staffing  pattern,  and  legal  status;  (ii) the \ndevelopment of guidelines for WUA formation and support within the country; and (iii) providing \ninstitutional strengthening to ensure that the support unit can properly operate in a sustainable \nmanner.  \n \n3.  The TA is divided into two phases: the preparation and the capacity-building phases. \nThe outcome is that the farmers in the project areas will receive better service from providers of \nirrigation and drainage, and be more able to manage their own farms effectively. \n \nB.  Consultants \n4.  The TA will require a total input of 12 person-months of international and 37 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants. The following breakdown of the consultants is indicative and \nsubject to revision at consultant selection stage, allowing one specialist to cater for more than \none position (person-months are given in parentheses). The international consultant inputs will \ninclude an agricultural economist/team leader (7), an irrigation institutions specialist (3), and a \nsmall business development/credit specialist (2). The domestic consultancy inputs will comprise \na  legal  specialist  (3),  a  WUA  specialist  (6),  an  irrigation  specialist  (4),  a  financial \nmanagement/credit specialist (6), an agricultural economist (3),  a monitoring and evaluation \nspecialist (12), and a public awareness specialist (3).   \n \n5.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  engage,  through  a  suitably  qualified  firm, \ninternational consultants with domestic associates, to provide services in accordance with the \nterms of reference following the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.2 The consultants will be \nrequired to work closely with MWRLR and other key stakeholders. The other government \ninstitutions that might participate in TA implementation include the National Bank of Tajikistan, \nMinistry  of  Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Economics  and  Trade,  and  Ministry  of  Justice.  The \n                                                 \n1  Traditional investors are local traders/exporters who provide seasonal credit, mostly in kind, to farmers using \nfarming products, mainly cotton, as collateral.  \n2  Simplified technical proposals and ADB's quality- and cost-based selection system will be used for the selection of \nconsultants.  \n   ", "Appendix 8          43 \n \nconsultants will also ni teract  with  the  ADB-financed Agricultural Rehabilitation Project, and \nrelevant ongoing projects of other international agencies. Intensive consultations should also be \nconducted with civil society organizations such as the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief \nEverywhere  (CARE)  International,  Agence  d'Aide  \u00e0  la  Coop\u00e9ration  Technique  et  au \nD\u00e9veloppement (ACTED), Aga Khan Foundation, and private sector organizations, such as \nTojiksogirot Bank, First Microfinance Bank, farmers, WUAs, and traders.  \n \nC.  Description of Tasks \n1.  Phase I: Needs Assessment, Analysis, and Preparatory Activities  \na.  Selection of Alternative Business Providers  \n6.  The consultants will undertake the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Assess marketing channels and value added chains of key farming inputs and \nproducts, and assess the input delivery systems in the project areas;  \n(ii)  Examine margins gained by each chain and channel between the farm gate in \nthe project areas and the main producers or buyers; \n(iii)  Assess the marketing mechanisms for key farming inputs and products, and \nevaluate the available banking and nonbanking agricultural financial services in \nthe project areas;   \n(iv)  Assess the impact of legal, administrative, and other factors that might limit \ndevelopment of a free market in provision of farmer support services, and identify \nhow these restrictions might be overcome; \n(v)  Examine the current investor services in the project areas such as the provision \nof credit (farm debts), technical advice, inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, fuel, seeds, \netc.)  and  marketing;  assess  the  strengths  and  limitations  of  the  potential \nalternative providers; and identify constraints to the development of competitive \nbusiness structures in the project areas;  \n(vi)  Develop  ranking  and  selection  criteria  and,  in  consultation  with  project \nstakeholders, rank the alternative providers of services to farmers in each area to \nidentify the best project partners for developing agricultural business services in \nthe project areas; and \n(vii)  In  consultation  with  farmers  and  business  providers,  develop  a  detailed \nimplementation plan for providing technical support to assist the establishment of \nalternative marketing structures in the core demonstration areas. \n \n  b.  Establishment of Water Users\u2019 Association Support Unit at Ministry \n  of Water Resources and Land Reclamation  \n7.  The consultants will carry out the following tasks:  \n \n(i)  Assess the existing structures within MWRLR that are working with WUAs, and \nstudy  alternatives  for  establishing  either  a  new  WUA  support  unit,  or  for \nrestructuring existing divisions to support WUAs development and operation;  \n(ii)  Assess  the  scope,  structure,  and  functions  of  WUAs  established  by  other \nprojects and financiers, and their linkages to MWRLR;  \n(iii)  Develop (following consultation with MWRLR, other development partners and \nprojects) appropriate definitions of WUA structure, responsibilities, and methods \nof operating for adoption throughout Tajikistan; \n ", "44  Appendix 8     \n(iv)  Develop a proposal for organizational arrangements for the WUA support unit \nincluding its objectives, legal status, mandate, functions, organizational structure, \nstaffing, job descriptions of key staff, etc.\u2014including arrangements for field units \nsuch as those to be supported under Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (IRP)    \n(v)  Assess capacity-building and training needs and other support required by the \nWUA support unit to develop viable and sustainable WUAs in Tajikistan; \n(vi)  Prepare guidelines, operation manual(s), and a financial plan, and assess the \nresources required for the day-to-day operation of the support unit;  \n(vii)  Develop a detailed implementation plan for the establishment of the support unit \nas a viable part of MWRLR; and \n(viii)  Organize  a  workshop  at  the  end  of  Phase  I  to  disseminate  the  TA \nrecommendations  and  proposed  actions  to  be  completed  before  the \ncommencement of Phase II. \n \n8.  The recommendations and proposed plans of action resulting from Phase I will be \ndisseminated  to  MWRLR,  other  concerned  government  agencies,  and  stakeholders  for \nconsideration and action prior to the commencement of Phase II.  \n \n2.

The consultants will carry out the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Establish a system for the monitoring and evaluation of policy reforms in the core \ndemonstration  areas  that  involves  participatory  consultation  with  key \nstakeholders, including civil society and elected representatives, and that can be \napplied during and after completion of the TA; and examine the potential for \nresponsibility for the monitoring process to be taken over by selected NGOs or \nother agencies after completion of the TA; \n(ii)  Monitor the progress of implementation of policy reforms in the project areas, as \nagreed by the Government, and their impact on farm productivity and profitability, \nthe cost and availability of inputs, output prices, farmers\u2019 incentives, etc. In \nparticular the TA will monitor progress in (a) the termination of the involvement of \nlocal  authorities  in  farm  operations,  management  and  marketing,  and  the \nremoval of remaining constraints to the free marketing and ginning of cotton; \n(b) the implementation of measures to improve conditions for the supply of \nagricultural  services  and  inputs  to  farmers  by  the  private  sector;  (c) the \nimplementation of land reform, the issuance of land certificates and the passing \nof legislation so that land certificates can be used as collateral; and (d) steps \ntaken to resolve the issue of farm debt; \n(iii)  Provide  feedback  on  compliance  with  other  policy  reform  agreements  with \nvarious bilateral and multilateral agencies, specifically the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF); \n(iv)  Establish a procedure for gathering feedback from stakeholders regarding any \ncorruption in the award and execution of contracts under the project loan. This \nfeedback will promote transparency in contract award procedures, and will serve \nas an independent check on the satisfactory implementation of the contracts; \n(v)  Carry  out  awareness  campaigns,  including  development  and  dissemination \nmaterials (e.g., brochures, posters) for the services offered by the WUA support \n   ", "Appendix 8          45 \n \nunit and alternative business providers. Disseminate information to farmers in the \nproject areas through consultations, group meetings, and mass media; and \n(vi)  Organize  a  workshop  at  the  end  of  the  Phase  II  to  disseminate  the  TA \nrecommendations  and  proposed  actions,  and  assess  and  analyze \nimplementation of policy reforms in the area. \n \n    b.  Capacity Building for Selected Business Providers \n \n10.  The consultants will carry out the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Provide  TA  and  support  to  the  selected  business  providers  in  developing \ncompetitive market structures in the project core demonstration areas; \n(ii)  Develop sample transparent financial agreements for provision of farm inputs \nand products;  \n(iii)  Support the selected business providers to introduce internationally recognized \ninvestment and lending practices in the core demonstration areas; \n(iv)  Propose  appropriate  systems  for  investment  monitoring  in  the  core \ndemonstration areas; and \n(v)  Formulate  recommendations  concerning  how  agricultural  business  provision \ncould be extended to the project areas. \n \n    c.  Capacity Building for the Water Users\u2019 Association Support Unit \n \n11.  Phase II of the TA will commence after staff have been recruited to the WUA support \nunit. The consultants will carry out the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Provide support services required to make the unit operational; \n(ii)  Train WUA support unit staff as identified during the needs assessment; \n(iii)  Develop use of the operational guidelines and practices for the establishment of \nWUAs prepared in Phase I through forming WUAs in the Irrigation Rehabilitation \nProject pilot areas. Identify any ways in which the procedures may be improved \nand develop an effective mechanism for collection of water fees;  \n(iv)  Develop, in consultation with the key stakeholders and as a result of experience \ngained in the pilot area, a program for the replication of WUAs within the project \nareas and the improvement of on-farm water management; and  \n(v)  Finalize recommendations on the responsibilities and operational procedures of \nthe WUA support unit.  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be MWRLR. The TA will be guided and monitored \nby the project steering committee already established under the loan project. MWRLR will \nprovide counterpart staff and facilities to work with the TA consultants.  \n \nE.   Technical Assistance Schedule and Reporting  \n13.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 24 months, starting in early 2006. The \nduration of Phase I will be 6 months, and of Phase II 12 months. It is anticipated that there will \nbe a period of up to 6 months between the two phases, to allow sufficient time to MWRLR to \nrecruit staff and prepare legal documents. The consultants will submit to MWRLR and ADB two \ninception reports: each month after starting work on a phase of the project. The consultants will \n ", "46  Appendix 8     \nalso submit a final report for Phase I, a midterm report on progress made in month 7 of Phase II, \na comprehensive draft final report at the end of the 10th month of Phase II, and a final report by \nthe end of TA implementation. Each report will include a report on the Government\u2019s progress \ntoward meeting loan safeguards. \n \nF.   Estimated Costs \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $625,000  equivalent,  of  which  $500,000 \nequivalent will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government \nthrough in-kind contributions will finance the remaining $125,000 equivalent. The estimated \nbreakdown of the costs is given in Table A8.1.

Introduction \n1.  Economic and financial analyses were carried out to justify the economic viability of the \nProject and the financial viability of farms. In general, comparisons of costs and benefits in the \nanalysis  of  projects  are  made  on  the  basis  of  quantifiable  physical  inputs  and  outputs. \nIncremental net benefits are estimated, where possible, on the basis of the changes expected to \noccur and other conditions expected to prevail within targeted geographic areas (i) in the \nabsence of the proposed Project\u2019s interventions, and (ii) as a consequence of implementing the \nproposed interventions. For the economic analysis, these quantifiable inputs and outputs are \nvalued according to their border price equivalents. For the financial analysis, established prices \nare applied as determined by local markets.  \n \n2.  The  principal  objective  of  the  economic  analysis  is  to  establish  whether  proposed \ninvestments are profitable for the economy as a whole, determined when the net present value \n(NPV) of costs and benefits are positive when discounted at the opportunity cost of capital. \n \n3.  The project has four principal components, which are: (i) rehabilitation of irrigation and \ndrainage infrastructure, (ii) support for agricultural development, (iii) improvement of potable \nwater supply systems, and (iv) project management. \n \n4.  The  Rehabilitation  of  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Infrastructure  component  includes \nrehabilitation of both pump stations and of headworks, canal structures, and other civil works. \nWithin the component there are five subcomponents for the districts of Asht, Vahdat, Farkhor, \nPanj,  and  Rushon.  Each  district  subcomponent  has  been  assessed  separately  and  then \ncombined to give an assessment for the whole project. The costs of the Support for Agricultural \nDevelopment are prorated for the overall project options according to the investment in irrigation \nand drainage in each district. The costs of Project Management are split evenly among the five \nsubcomponents. \n \n5.  Economic analysis for the Improvement of Potable Water Supply Systems has been \ncarried out separately using the time-savings method recently developed by the Economics and \nResearch Department of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the analysis of rural water \nsupply systems. This method compares time savings with the annualized capital costs and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs of each system to determine whether the minimum \nrequirement of positive NPV at the opportunity cost of capital is met. It does not calculate actual \nNPV or economic internal rate of return (EIRR). All five water supply schemes have results \nconsistent with EIRR greater than 12%. The costs and benefits of this component are not \nincluded in the assessment of the overall Project. \n \nB.   Areas, Cropping Pattern, and Yields \n6.  The total project area, in the five districts, is 47,500 hectares (ha) of irrigated land, with \nan estimated 262,000 beneficiaries. The two major crops, cotton and wheat, are planted on \nabout 50% and 21% of the area. The remaining area is planted with fruit, vegetables, and \nfodder. Orchards are particularly important in Asht district and in the upper part of the Asht-1 \ncascade are the dominant crop, occupying about 75% of the area. Present average yields vary \namong the districts, from 1.2 tons (t)/ha for cotton in Asht to 2.0 t/ha in Panj. For wheat, average \nyields vary from 1.6 t/ha in Asht to 3.1 t/ha in Farkhor. \n \n   ", "Appendix  9          49 \n7.  The quality of seed available to farmers, especially for the major crops, is generally of a \nlow standard with the result that yields are lower than could be achieved if seed of higher \nperforming varieties were more widely available. Increasing the supply of higher quality seed \ncan have significant benefits for farmers. Crop pests and diseases are also widespread, with \nsimilar negative impacts on crop output.  \n \n8.  Double cropping is not widespread in Tajikistan, although there is some scope for it in \nlocations where a short cycle vegetable or fodder crop can follow wheat or an early vegetable \ncrop. The potential and practical possibilities for intensifying and diversifying crop production will \nbe demonstrated in the crop production program in the core demonstration areas. Gradual \nadoption of these methods, supported by expanding domestic markets as the economy grows, \nwill lead to an increase in cropping intensity. \n \nC.   Major Assumptions \n9.  Economic  and  financial  prices  for  traded  goods  (wheat  and  cotton  and  nitrogen, \nphosphorous  and  potassium  fertilizers)  are  derived  from  World  Bank  commodity  price \nprojections for the years up  to 2015. Prices are adjusted to 2004 constant prices using the \nmanufacturing unit values index and are adjusted for insurance, freight, and handling to derive \nborder prices. The border prices are adjusted by the shadow exchange rate factor and by \ndeductions for local transport, storage, handling, and processing costs (where appropriate) to \nobtain estimated farm-gate prices and are converted to somoni at the official exchange rate.  \n \n10.  Prices for nontraded agricultural inputs and outputs are based on 2004 prices in the \nproject districts. A combination of official sources, data from farms in each district and market \nprices, adjusted to allow for transport and traders\u2019 margins, have been used. Machinery costs \nhave been based on current data from farms in each district for the principal mechanized \nactivities. Taxes on land and wages have been applied at the current rates in the financial \nanalysis of farm budgets. \n \n11.  Daily wage rates for each district have been calculated based on data from farms in \neach district. This data generally implies different daily rates for each crop, but in order to \nsimplify the analysis, a single average rate has been estimated and applied for each district. \nThese rates vary from TJS1.00 per day in Rushon to TJS1.50 per day in Asht and Vahdat.  \n \n12.  The cost of pumping water to farms in the Asht and Farkhor pump irrigation areas is \ndirectly proportional to the cost of electricity. The financial price used in the analysis is TJS \n0.012/kilowatt-hour (kWh) which is the current price applying for the water sector. The economic \nprice adopted for this project is the long-run marginal cost of electricity of $0.021/kWh (TJS \n0.063/kWh).1 \n \n13.  The analysis is in 2004 constant prices. An exchange rate of $1= TJS3.00 has been \nused, the discount rate is 12%, and the project life is 25 years. The shadow exchange rate \nfactor is 1.11, which is the value generally accepted for use in Tajikistan and is consistent with \nthe general level of tariffs in force and with other factors affecting domestic prices. Domestic and \nnontraded goods are valued at their local market rates. The shadow wage rate factor for rural \nlabor is 0.80, which reflects the high levels of unemployment and underemployment currently \nfound in rural areas of Tajikistan.  \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2004.

Agricultural production will be the principal source of benefits for the Project. The level of \nbenefits accruing varies among the districts, with the main differences occurring between pump \nand gravity-fed areas: \n \n(i)  with rehabilitation of pump stations, the water supply to farms will be assured and \nthe risk of supply failure reduced or eliminated; the security of supply will reduce \nthe potential for stress during critical growth periods and encourage farmers to \nincrease investment in production; \n(ii)  without rehabilitation, the pump stations would continue in operation for some \ntime\u2014perhaps 10 years or more\u2014but would experience a gradual decline in \nefficiency and in the volumes of water supplied to the canals as they age further; \n(iii)  rehabilitation of headworks, canals, and canal structures in areas supplied by \ngravity will also improve the reliability and timeliness of supply and will reduce the \nrisk of stress at critical periods of plant growth; and \n(iv)  without  rehabilitation  of  these  structures,  the  supply  of  water  to  farms  will \ngradually be less reliable and the volumes supplied may decline. In gravity-fed \nareas, the decline will be less than in pump irrigation areas and the risk of total \nfailure of supply is minimal. \n \n15.  The Project supports the expansion of the supply of high quality seed available to \nfarmers and will introduce a training program in integrated pest management. Both of these \nprograms will have a positive impact on crop yields and agricultural production. \n \n16.  Rehabilitation of the pumping cascades results in energy savings in Asht and Farkhor \ndistricts. Significant energy saving benefits also arise from the conversion of the upper parts of \nthe Asht-1 cascade to gravity supply through the diversion of the Pongaz-Say river. \n \nE.   Economic Internal Rate of Return \n17.  The EIRR for the Project is 20.7% with an NPV of $9.9 million. The EIRR and NPV for \nthe district subprojects are shown in Table A9.1. All the district subprojects have acceptable \nEIRRs well above 12%.  \n \nTable A9.1:  Net Present Value and Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \nSubproject  NPV ($\u2019000)  EIRR (%) \nAsht  1,324  16.2 \nFarkhor  5,254  26.1 \nPanj  1,779  19.3 \nRushon  117  13.5 \nVahdat  1,407  23.3 \n     Project Total  9,880  20.7 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n   ", "Appendix  9          51 \nF.   Sensitivity Analysis \n18.  The results of the sensitivity analysis for the Project are shown in Table A9.2.

The economic results for the Project are robust to negative changes in key variables. \nThe combination of cost overruns and a fall in all output prices would reduce the project \noutcome, but would have to be severe to threaten viability. Delays in project implementation and \nconsequent delays in achieving benefits would be the most likely source of a threat to the \nProject\u2019s overall economic viability. \n \nG.   Financial Analysis: Farm Budgets \n20.  Based on the models developed to assess the project, farm budgets were estimated for \nlarge farms, dekhan farms, and household plots, for each district. These allow the impact of the \nProject on the different types of farms to be evaluated. There are still many large farms \noperating in these districts, but the Government is committed to phasing them out within several \nyears and replacing them with individual dekhan farms. The expected impact of the Project on \ndekhan farms and household plots is therefore important. \n \n21.  As shown in Table A9.3, the dekhan farms all show increases in income with the Project, \nwith the largest proportional increases in Asht where current yields for cotton and wheat are low \ncompared with other districts. The smallest expected increases in dekhan farm income are in \nthe gravity-fed parts of the Farkhor system, but these and other gravity-fed areas are less \nvulnerable than the pump irrigation areas to fall in income without the Project.  \n \n22.  The Project will also have a positive impact on production from household plots in all \nareas, with the increase after 7 years ranging from 20% in the Farkhor gravity-fed areas to \naround 30% in the pump irrigation areas of Asht and Farkhor because of the expected greater \nimpact of the Project on water supply in the pumped areas. These increases are important \nbecause many rural households depend upon the production of these plots to supplement food \nsupplies and, to a lesser extent, household income as indicated in Table A9.4. \n \n ", "52  Appendix 9   \nTable A9.3: Farm Net Income\u2014Dekhan Farms \n(TJS, 2004 constant prices) \n \nFuture without \nArea   Future with Project \nDistrict  Present  Project \n(ha) \nYear 5  Year 10  Year 5  Year 10 \nAsht-1\u2014upper area  16.6  692  2,182  2,613  233  -328 \nAsht-1\u2014lower area  16.6  (-124)  2,676  2,844  (-705)  (-1,899) \nVahdat  5.0  2,171  3,032  3,241  2,394  2,376 \nFarkhor\u2014pump area  69.0  20,959  31,257  37,138  17,091  9,937 \nFarkhor\u2014gravity area  69.0  20,959  30,103  35,157  22,896  22,265 \nPanj  22.0  12,906  15,209  16,620  13,576  13,151 \nRushon  44.0  28,074  37,324  41,356  26,948  25,080 \n   ha = hectare. \n   Note: Pumping cost of water not included. \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A9.4:   Farm Net Income\u2014Household Plots \n(TJS, 2004 constant prices) \n \nFuture without \nArea   Future with Project \nDistrict  Present  Project \n(ha) \nYear 5  Year 10  Year 5  Year 10 \nAsht-1\u2014upper area  0.18  133  172  188  116  96 \nAsht-1\u2014lower area  0.18  119  158  181  99  81 \nVahdat  0.13  185  221  243  185  185 \nFarkhor\u2014pump area  0.09  83  111  133  68  51 \nFarkhor\u2014gravity area  0.09  83  101  115  80  76 \nPanj  0.22  173  198  214  128  128 \nRushon  0.05  128  159  176  117  108 \n   ha = hectare. \n   Note: Pumping cost of water not included. \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n   ", "    Appendix 10         53 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Tajikistan: \n \nGrowth in Tajikistan\u2019s agriculture sector, and the cotton subsector in particular, would play a crucial role in poverty \nreduction. In 2002, the agriculture sector contributed 26% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and two thirds of \nits labor force (World Bank, 2004, Tajikistan Poverty Assessment Update, draft, page 19). The cotton subsector, which \nsupported three fourths of the country\u2019s farm households and occupied the same share of its farmlands, accounted for 30% \nof Tajikistan\u2019s export revenues (ibid).  \n \nAlthough there is no official definition of poverty line in the country, recent available statistics indicate that income poverty in \nTajikistan is widespread and severe in the countryside, especially in the cotton-growing areas. If defined according to the \nState Statistical Agency (SSA) minimum food basket benchmark of Tajik Somoni 20 per person per month, the poverty \nincidence of the country in 1999 was 83%; this declined to 67% in 2003 (ibid, page 3). The World Bank study, which used a \npoverty threshold of $2.15 per person per day, at 2000 purchasing power parity (PPP), also showed a decreasing (albeit \nhigh) trend\u2014from 81% in 1999 down to 64% in 2003.  Poverty was more prevalent in rural areas where 65% of its \nhouseholds were poor (using the $2.15 per day poverty line definition), compared with 59% in the urban centers. Khatlon \nand Sughd regions, which produced 85% of the country\u2019s cotton and home to 65% of the country\u2019s population, accounted \nfor 76% of the total poor households and 72% of the total extremely poor households (using $1 per person per day at 2000 \nPPP). The rural poor consisted mainly of agricultural workers, especially on cotton farms, families with many children, the \nelderly, the sick and invalids, and women (especially female-headed households). Labor income remained the most \nimportant income source for all households (at 45% of total household income), followed by the imputed value of food \nproduced at home and gifts of foodstuffs (24%) (ibid, Annex 1). Consumption expenses grew even for the poor households \nin 2003. As expected, the share of total household expenditure on food for the bottom 20% of the income decile was higher \n(71\u201373% of all expenditure on food) than the top 20% (62%). Interestingly, the share of the imputed consumption value of \nhome food-produced to total food expenditures was much lower for all household incomes levels when compared with its \nshare in 1999. More than half of food expenditures for all household income groups were purchased from the market. The \nmajor reason for the lower share of home food consumption was because food from the garden plots was becoming less \nsufficient to support a family due to declining productivity  of these plots. While access to food from markets may have \nimproved, the purchasing power especially of the bottom 20% was nevertheless still insufficient so that various coping \nmechanisms (like selling household assets, sending children to relatives, etc.) were employed. The most disturbing fact \nfrom a nutritional viewpoint was that more than half of the poorest households ate an average of one meal or less a day.  \n \nWhile high and continued positive economic growth in the past years (averaging 8% per annum) particularly from the \nagriculture sector, has contributed to poverty reduction (as indicated by the poverty reduction elasticity of 1.08), the benefits \nto the rural poor were uneven. Khatlon and Sughd, which recorded the highest per capita GDP growth rates in 2003, had \nstill the largest proportion of poor households. The major reason for the high GDP growth rates in the cotton-growing \nregions was the increase in the world price of cotton. For growth to have a more lasting impact on poverty in the cotton \nsubsector, structural reforms would be required that would essentially improve the profitability of cotton farms.  \n \nIt should be stressed that poverty in Tajikistan is also nonincome based, characterized by a worsening human development \nsituation due to lack of essential services, and increasing economic and social disparities that particularly affect women. A \nkey element of nonincome-based poverty is the lack of clean drinking water in rural Tajikistan. The Poverty Reduction \nStrategy Paper (PRSP) of 2003 reported that only 40% of Tajikistan's population used piped water at home or outdoors. \nLimited access to potable water has a tremendous impact on poverty, including work-days lost due to illness and time spent \ntransporting water from long distances. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                      Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention  \n \nThough poverty statistics countrywide indicate that the incidence of poverty is decreasing, most villagers in the Project\u2019s \ncotton-growing areas think otherwise. During stakeholder meetings, villagers who participated in the self-rating poverty \nassessments said that the income structure has not changed and that poor households in their villages constitute \napproximately 75% of all households, middle about 15%, and rich 10%. Local villagers typically described the poor or \nvulnerable groups as agricultural workers,  dekhan farmers working for collective  dekhan farms or joint stock farms, \ngovernment workers on a salary, households without garden  plots or livestock, single women, households containing \nmultiple families under one roof, pensioners, and invalids. Villagers identified the rich in their villages as independent \n ", "54  Appendix 10          \n \ndekhan farmers, people who had developed an asset base during the Soviet period (and still maintained that asset base), \nand those who knew how to operate in a market economy. \n \nAt the five project sites, three general themes emerged as a cause of poverty\u2014lack of water for irrigation and drinking, lack \nof access to land, and lack of jobs. Villagers saw physical improvements in their irrigation systems as a potential avenue to \nescape extreme poverty, if the improvements led directly to more reliable and assured irrigation water supplies for both \nlarge cotton fields and also smaller household gardens. Villagers also consistently commented on the need for more \nopportunities to become independent  dekhan farmers, in control of their agricultural inputs and outputs, rather than \ndependent on collective dekhan farms and outside investors. Village women in particular often stated that they have skills \n(e.g., baking, weaving) but they have no \"job place\" to demonstrate those skills and earn an income. \n \nThe design of the Project addresses the key causes of income poverty. Low productivity and hence low incomes from \ncotton farms are caused by the unreliable supply of irrigation water due to deteriorating  irrigation and drainage (I&D) \nfacilities. The Project will cover the rehabilitation of I&D facilities on 47,500 ha in five districts. The five districts were \nselected through a systematic screening and stakeholder consultations that took into account social (predominance of poor \nhouseholds)  and  institutional  factors,  potential  to  increase  economic  and  social  benefits,  and  low  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs. Rehabilitation of I&D will be complemented with improvement of land and water management, \nformation of water users\u2019 associations (WUAs) in core demonstration areas and the establishment of a WUA support unit in \nthe Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR). Together with improved land and water management \npractices, these project measures will increase yields and cropping intensities in both the cotton and household farms; will \ngenerate on-farm jobs; and thus, will ensure more stable and secure farm income. The Project is likewise pro-gender. \nWomen-headed farm households and women farmers will be proactively involved in the whole project cycle and in the \norganization and development of WUAs. Nonincome poverty will also be partly addressed by the Project through the \nprovision of rural potable water for a population of 57,000 in selected project areas.  \n \nIrrigation development in the project areas will lead to job creation and higher incomes. Approximately 153,000 poor farm \nhouseholds will benefit from the Project; generate an increase of 41% in dekhan farm incomes, and 33% in household plots \nincomes; and create opportunities for growth. Increased agricultural outputs (cotton by 23% and wheat by 21%) will lead to \nincreased rural incomes, particularly among the poor. Improved agriculture activities will spur the demand for labor \nestimated at 750,000 labor-days. In sum, the economic benefits will redound more to the poor households than the \nbeneficiary groups. Sustained income benefits to the poor households will translate in the medium term into a decrease in \nthe poverty incidence in the project areas of 5%.  \n \nThe Project will also produce indirect impacts. Improved land privatization efforts would accelerate the ability of the poor to \ngenerate income, as being an independent dekhan farmer consistently means more freedom of choice, more ability to \nfollow the market, and ultimately higher incomes. \n \n \nFull land privatization often results in cheaper farm inputs, as competition accompanies land privatization. Independent \ndekhan farmers in the project sites consistently reported agricultural input prices 50% cheaper than that input prices at \ncollective dekhan farms. Lastly, nonincome poverty will be addressed in this Project by rehabilitating rural water supply \nsystems, and 5,150 poor households are estimated to benefit from new potable water supply facilities. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nTwelve stakeholder meetings were held in the project areas. A total of 175 stakeholders participated in the dialogues. \nStakeholder  representatives  included  those  from  local  government,  irrigation,  and  agricultural  officials,  teachers, \ndoctors/health workers, women's groups, agricultural workers,  dekhan farmers (independent and collective), landless \nlaborers, dekhan farmers' associations, and local nongovernment organizations (NGOs). After gathering quantitative \ndescriptive data from local village officials, discussions were held focusing on poverty (definition, causes, how to escape, \netc.), village needs and demands, rural and agricultural structure, debt, socioeconomic profile, and prospects and \nconstraints of WUAs. Wealth ranking and role playing exercises were also employed to more fully understand the villagers' \nperceptions, attitudes, and behavior toward poverty. During the stakeholder meetings, the participation exercises helped \nsharpen how the irrigation rehabilitation should be carried out and managed, and how the Project could be focused more to \nfight poverty (e.g., better water management, employing local villagers in civil works to the maximum extent possible, urging \nthe government to accelerate and improve land privatization). \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe Project's participation strategy will focus on ensuring the involvement of the project beneficiaries\u2014including the poor, \nwomen, and vulnerable groups\u2014in all phases of project design, implementation,  and monitoring. Both participatory \n   ", "    Appendix 10         55 \nprocesses and local rural institutions will be established to operationalize these participatory approaches. Processes include \n(i) further stakeholder meetings at the village level as project design and implementation proceeds; (ii) a participatory and \ncommunity-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanism and process focusing on strengthening local users' groups \nduring the actual monitoring process; (iii) rehabilitation consultation/dialogues with farmers meeting regularly with irrigation \nofficials (primarily through the WUAs) to coordinate canal closings, water delivery times, and future irrigation canal \nmanagement strategies; and (iv) intercommunity exchanges/immersions with Ministry of Water Resources and Land \nReclamation officials, government policy makers, representatives of development partners, and project officials, to \nexchange experiences and improve implementation procedures. Rural institutions will include (i) WUAs formed in the \nirrigation systems focusing on improved irrigation management and on O&M; (ii) participatory water committees responsible \nfor long-term O&M of the rehabilitated village water supply system; (iii) women's groups supported by international and local \nNGOs, focusing not only on activities specific to women, but also enlarging activities for women to fully participate in all \nproject activities; and (iv) informal associations of independent dekhan farmers who have banded together for economies of \nscale. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nA gender action plan has been prepared (Appendix 12) that will maximize the impact of this Project on women. The plan \nhas five focal areas: (i) women\u2019s representation, (ii) skills enhancement for women, (iii) provision for a gender specialist, \n(iv) gender sensitivity in monitoring and evaluation, and (v) advocacy for gender and development.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Gender Status and Issues \n1.  Because of Tajikistan's civil war in the mid-1990s and the migration of men in search of \nwork in Russia, female-headed households are very common in rural Tajikistan. It is estimated \nthat about 18% of total rural households are headed by women. The share of this type of \nhousehold is expected to rise as more men from rural areas migrate in search of work. As many \nof the men do not send remittances to their families from Russia, the women often have to play \nthe multiple roles of earning income for their families, providing for their sustenance, and taking \ncare of the children. In the project sites, the women are in charge of the garden plots, which are \noften the family\u2019s main source of food. Reliable access to irrigation water would help women \nincrease their garden plot\u2019s productivity. \n  \n2.  Aside from the garden plots, women augment their incomes by working. However, \nunemployment and underemployment in the villages are considered as the most important \nproblems  by  villagers  (especially  the  women).  Some  local  officials  estimated  the  level  of \nunemployment in their areas at 80%. Often, there are only one or two employers in a given \narea, such as a cotton factory or school. Women traditionally work in the social (education and \nhealth) and agriculture sectors, where wages are five to eight times lower than salaries in the \nindustry and construction sectors. The women\u2019s role in the cotton farms is particularly important \nduring both the planting (spring) and harvest (fall) seasons when as many as 90% of the field \nworkers are women and children. However, salaries as agricultural workers on the collective \ndekhan farms are extremely low. During cotton harvesting, agricultural workers are paid per \nkilogram picked, ranging from approximately 6 diram/kg to 55 diram/kg picked.  \n \n3.  Any  economic  event  in  the  cotton  sector  will  have  large  implications  on  women's \nincomes, their time, and their families. On five different occasions during the 12 stakeholder \nmeetings, women working in the cotton sector pointed out that they would need better water, \nland, and jobs. They said their present status as agricultural workers in the cotton sector was \ncharacterized  by  unreliable  water  supplies  and  few  opportunities  to  join  the  ranks  of \nindependent dekhan farmers or find employment opportunities. \n \n4.  Increasing access to potable drinking water will favorably impact on women in the \nproject areas. About 30% of the farm households in the project sites get water from rivers, \nlakes, and ponds. Over 40% of the project households use water from sources more than 100 \nmeters  away  and  the  majority  of  those  who  fetch  the  water  are  women  and  children. \nWaterborne diseases are likewise common in these areas. Improved access to potable water \nsupplies would thus help women play a more active role in village economic activities, as less \ntime would be spent in carrying water and caring for the sick.  \n \nB.  Gender Strategy and Action Plan \n5.  The Project will address these concerns by taking actions that on the one hand will \nimprove (i) women\u2019s participation in the water users\u2019 association (WUAs), water committees, \nand in the planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of the project; (ii) their \naccess to project information; and (iii) their technical skills in farm production and organizational \nskills as they become involved in community-based organizations and project-related activities; \nand on the other hand will promote gender responsiveness among policy makers and other \nstakeholders involved in the project.  \n \n   ", "Appendix 11  57 \n6.  The Project\u2019s gender action plan will focus on: \n \n(i)  Women\u2019s  representation. The Project will ensure that in the provision and \ndelivery of each of the four project components, the participation of women will \nbe  ensured.  Under  the  rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure \ncomponent (a) 50% of households headed by women in the project sites will be \nmembers of the WUAs;1 and (b) at least 25% of representatives in the project \ndesign,  planning,  and  implementation  meetings  will  be  women.  For  the \nimprovement of potable water supply systems component, women will constitute \nat least 30% of the members of the local drinking water decision-making bodies. \nIn the support for agricultural development component, at least 30% of women \nfarm workers will become members of local farmers\u2019 groups. In the project \nmanagement, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) component, at least 20% of \nthe staff of project management offices, project implementation units, and the \nM&E units will be women. \n \n(ii)  Skills enhancement for women. The Project will ensure that at least (a) 20% of \nfarm households headed by women participate in activities in the Project\u2019s core \ndemonstration  areas;  (b) 25%  of  those  trained  in  land  and  water  farm \nmanagement, new cultural practices, and rural water supply management are \nwomen;  and  (c) 25%  of  those  participating  in  other  organizational  skills \nenrichment activities are women. \n \n(iii)  Provision of a gender specialist. A gender and social development specialist \nwill  be  employed  to  (a) provide  an  assessment  of  the  gender  and  social \n(including poverty) issues and concerns in the project sites using quantitative and \nqualitative methods of analysis, (b) develop a gender plan of action that will \naddress the issues and concerns related to the project, and (c) develop an \nimplementation  mechanism  and  advocacy  strategy  for  following  through  the \naction plan. The specialist will also assist in the design of the M&E system to \nensure that it incorporates gender, poverty, and social concerns adequately.   \n \n(iv)  Gender  sensitivity  in  monitoring  and  evaluation. The gender and social \ndevelopment  specialist  will  ensure  that  the  design  of  the  M&E  system \nincorporates  appropriate  inputs,  outputs,  and  outcome  indicators  that  reflect \nwomen\u2019s  concerns  about  the  Project.  The  M&E  system  will  also  include  a \nfeedback mechanism to provide project staff with information and assessments \nof the perceptions and views of the Project\u2019s female and male beneficiaries on \nthe progress and impact of the Project.  \n \n(v)  Advocacy  for  gender  and  development.  Gender  and  development  as  an \nintegral policy outcome of the project will be pursued through the inclusion of \ngender-related  agenda  in  the  policy  dialogues  with  central  and  local  policy \nmakers and in stakeholder meetings and other forums that will be initiated during \nthe Project. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  This is the same target proportion as for farm households as a whole. \n ", "58   Appendix 12 \nSHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Background \n1.  The  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project  will  improve  the  living  standards  of  farming \ncommunities in project areas with improvements in farm household incomes through increased \nfarm productivity and improved access to potable water. To achieve this the Project has four \nmain components: (i) selected rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, (ii) support \nfor agricultural development, (iii) improvement of potable water supply systems, and (iv) project \nmanagement.  \n \n2.  Within the Project, rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation and drainage systems \nand rural water supply systems have potential limited involuntary resettlement impacts.   \n \n3.  All land in Tajikistan is state-owned. Land use is directed by the state through the district \nadministrations,  specifically  the  local  offices  of  the  State  Land  Committee  and  district \nadministrative offices (Hukumat). Inheritable land use rights are provided for under Tajikistan's \nland tenure reform, but the process is at a very early stage of implementation. Tajikistan\u2019s Land \nCode addresses potential compensation for people who legally occupy government land and \nare forced to relocate, but the Land Code does not address compensation for people illegally \noccupying government land and forced to relocate. \n \n4.  Potable Water Supply Systems. In Asht district, the construction of a drinking water \nreservoir will require a village road to be moved slightly (a few meters), thus using some \nadditional empty government wasteland. Additionally, it is possible that a small edge of a \nhousehold fence, which encloses a large vegetable garden, may also have to be moved slightly \n(less than a meter [m]) , along a distance of less than 5.0 m and thus involving no more than 5.0 \nsquare meter (m2). As the potential drinking water reservoir is fed by springs, the location of the \nreservoir is critical and it may be that other design options are not feasible. The actual degree of \nconstraint will not be possible to determine until the topographical survey is carried out at the \nstart of the design process. It is presumed that the fenced land is legally occupied and \ncompensation would therefore need to be negotiated if the garden is to be encroached. It is \nquite possible that for such a small area, the compensation could be in kind, such as provision \nof a new fence and gate, rather than financial.  \n \n5.  Additionally, some rehabilitation of rural water systems requires laying of underground \npipes, which will require digging up agricultural land during the off-season, outside the growing \nperiod. Temporarily, therefore, this pipe laying could disrupt some agricultural land, though the \nland would be restored for the next growing season. There will be no impact on harvest from \nthese  activities  and  therefore  no  compensation  will  be  required.  The  Ministry  of  Water \nResources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR) has agreed that during the laying of underground \npipes, households whose agricultural land is affected will be given priority for construction jobs \nwith contractors to the maximum extent possible.  \n \n6.  Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation. For irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, works \nwill be confined within the boundaries of installations (e.g., pumping stations), or along linear \nstructures (irrigation and drainage canals). \n \n7.  There will be very limited new construction in WRDRP. The priority for new construction \nin WRDRP is a new settling basin on government land near the intake of the main canal in \nHamadoni district, Khatlon region. The size of the potential settling basin will be from 10 to 15 \nhectares (ha). Nine Tajik households without title or permission to use the land are presently \n   ", "                          Appendix 12  59 \ncultivating approximately 6.5 ha of government land at the settling basin site. The households \nmembers are not living at the site, they are only cultivating land at the site. No structures, \ntherefore, would have to be moved or replaced. The size of the future settling basin requires \nless than half of the land potentially available for construction and therefore there is scope for \nselecting a more advantageous location and not extending to areas illegally and irregularly \ncultivated by persons residing in villages outside the site. Nevertheless, a short resettlement \nplan has been developed to adequately address and compensate these households, ensuring \nthat their livelihood will not be negatively affected by the construction of the settling basin. \n \n8.  Seven of the nine households were contacted, interviewed, and consulted about the \npotential Project and the possible resettlement required. The size of the land being cultivated by \nthe seven interviewed households is shown in Table A12.1. \n \nTable A12.1: Size of Cultivated Land per Household \n \nHousehold  Estimated Size of Land Cultivated \n(hectares) \n1  0.80 \n2  1.40 \n3  0.61 \n4  0.50 \n5  0.20 \n6  0.02 \n7  3.00 \nTotal  6.53 \n                         Source: Field surveys. \n \n9.  Farmers from the seven households contacted said the other two households farm have \nvery small plots of land on the potential settling basin site, approximately 0.02 ha each. \n \n10.  Two of the seven interviewed households have four family members, and the other five \nhouseholds have from 12 to 24 family members. The heads of the seven households all have \nsecondary level education, with two heads of households with technical secondary education, \nand two with university level education. Household members are either former or present \nemployees of the District Irrigation Office and they are very familiar with the needs for irrigation \nsystem rehabilitation and a new settling basin. Five of seven households have children living \nand working in Russia. \n \n11.  The main crops grown in the 6.5 ha are wheat, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, melons, \nand maize. The interviewed farmers did not know the exact yields of their crops, but they \nestimate that onions were at about 2.0 metric tons (mt)/ha, melon at 1.5 mt/ha, and maize at 4.0 \nmt/ha.1 Three of the seven households (covering 3.63 ha of the total 6.53 ha) reported that the \ncrops are for home consumption and they receive no cash income from the crops. The other \nfour households (covering 2.9 ha out of the total 6.53 ha) estimated that they receive small \nannual incomes from the crops grown, ranging from 300-400 TJS/year ($100\u2013133), to 3,000 \nTJS/year ($1,000).2  \n                                                 \n1  The accuracy of their yield estimates is questionable and would require further verification. One respondent \nguessed his onion yield was 7.0\u20138.0 mt/ha. \n2  The accuracy of these income figures is also questionable. The respondents have no formal records of either their \nyields or incomes, and during the interviews the respondents said that they really did not know the yields or \nincomes. It was only when interviewers asked for estimates of yields and incomes, that the respondents provided \ninformation. Data from the Poverty and Social Analysis in nearby Farkhor District show annual household incomes \nrange from about TJS2,600 ($866) to TJS24,000 ($8,000). \n ", "60   Appendix 12 \n12.  Six of the seven households reported that they were not farming land outside the land \nthey are cultivating in the proposed settling basin site.3 One household reported that they have \n0.7 ha of land outside the site. \n \n13.  During more qualitative discussions, the seven households were aware of the benefits to \nthe entire district if a settling basin were to be constructed, as they all work for the district \nirrigation office. The respondents said they realize they have no title or permission to farm this \nland, but since the land was vacant, they started cultivating small plots there. The heads of \nhousehold interviewed all agreed that they would have no objection to giving up this land for the \nsettling  basin.  They  agreed  that  being  offered  alternative  land  by  the  district  Hukumat \n(administrative office) would be accepted, as well as receiving employment and wages during \nthe construction of the settling basin. All nontitled affected persons will be allowed to harvest \ntheir crops before civil works start.  \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement   \n14.  There will be no land acquisition during resettlement as the government presently owns \nthe land, and there are no structures on the land. Only the 6.5 ha of cultivated land will be \naffected. There will be no loss of homes, but the loss of livelihood will be compensated.  \n \nC.  Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements  \n15.  The Tajikistan Land Code (Article 48) states that if land is taken from a physical and \njuridical or legal person for state and public needs, those persons will be apportioned the same \nvalue  of  land,  and  losses  including  income  will  be  fully  compensated.  The  chief  of  the \nDepartment of International Relations at Tajikistan\u2019s State Land Committee has stated that the \ndistrict-level Hukumat can compensate people who are forced to relocate, even if  it is only \ncultivated land, not houses, that must be relocated. Extensive discussions have been held with \nthe Hamadoni district Hukumat to ensure that the nine households receive full and complete \ncompensation.  \n   \n16.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  addresses \n\u201closses of land, resources, and means of livelihood or social support systems, which people \nsuffer as a result of ADB projects\u2026\u201d. The proposed Project will not cause any population \ndisplacement, but there is the possibility that a few households may lose access to land from \nwhich they derive some income. Although these households do not possess land use rights, the \nresettlement plan ensures that those whose lives and incomes may be affected will be assisted \nto ensure the same level of well-being as prior to the Project. \n \nD.  Consultation and Grievance Redress Participation \n17.  Consultations with the affected people cultivating the 6.5 ha have been ongoing since \nthe project preparatory technical assistance stage, involving trips to sites by both international \nand national consultants, consultations with the affected people, socioeconomic questionnaires, \nqualitative discussions with members of the affected households, multiple meetings with district-\nlevel and irrigation offices, and numerous discussions at the national level with the State Land \nCommittee of Tajikistan, and the Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR) \nin Dushanbe.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Like many rural households in Tajikistan, it is very likely that these seven households do have household gardens \nand presidential land plots outside the site, but during the interviews, they only referred to independent land \noutside the site. \n   ", "                          Appendix 12  61 \n18.  All parties to the discussions have agreed to ensure the welfare of the nine affected \nhouseholds. Most of the nine households have members who are presently or previously \nemployed by the district irrigation office. The district administration in Hamadoni district, in \ncoordination  with  the  district  irrigation  offices  in  Hamadoni  and  Farkhor,  will  address  any \nappeals of affected persons. \n \nE.  Compensation, Relocation, and Income Restoration \n19.  There  are  three  key  elements  related  to  compensation,  relocation,  and  income \nrestoration. First, the Hukumat of Hamadoni district has agreed to provide irrigated land for the \nnine households, of equal or better quality, for compensation for their potential loss of livelihood. \nSecond, MWRLR has agreed that during construction of the settling basin, members from the \nnine households will be given priority for construction jobs with contractors to the maximum \nextent possible.4 Third, MWRLR has also agreed to the extent possible, qualified members from \nthe nine affected households will be considered for employment with the district irrigation office. \nAs noted above, most of the households have members already employed by the district \nirrigation office, making future employment even more likely. \n \n20.  There  will  be  no  housing  relocation,  as  the  households  are  outside  the  proposed \nconstruction site. Only cultivated land will be affected. The land provided to the households from \nthe district authorities will also have to consider accessibility, fertility, and provision of irrigation \nwater. \n \nF.  Institutional Framework \n21.  Planning, implementation, inspection, and assessment will be the responsibility of the \ndistrict authorities, in  coordination with the district irrigation office. The project management \noffice (PMO) and MWRLR will also provide oversight to the implementation of the resettlement \nplan. Dissemination of information and public discussions with the affected people will also be \nundertaken at periodic intervals to ensure proper implementation of the resettlement plan and \nfacilitate resettlement. \n \nG.  Resettlement Budget and Financing \n22.  There will be no land acquisition. For households that lose access to land, MWRLR will \nensure that replacement land will be provided and households will receive land use rights on \nthis  land.  There  will  be  minor  costs  involved  in  monitoring  and  providing  support  for \nresettlement, and those costs, as well as any unforeseen costs, will be covered by the Project. \n \nH.  Implementation Schedule \n23.  Detailed planning and implementation of resettlement will take place well before the \nbeginning of civil works construction of the settling basin. Details are provided in Table A12.2. \n \n                                                 \n4  It should be noted that the seven households interviewed enthusiastically agreed that if they were able to receive \nemployment during the construction of the settling basin, they would willingly give up their illegal cultivation on this \n6.5 ha. The prospect of income-producing jobs seemed to outweigh their desire to continue cultivating these small \nplots of land. It is also difficult at this time to accurately estimate the potential income lost due to the loss of the 6.5 \nha, as three of the seven households reported no income from the crops, and the other four households were very \nvague regarding income received from the crops. Though income was reported from these four households, \nfarmers generally said that crops were for home consumption. In any event, jobs during the construction of the \nsettling basin could pay as much as TJS300 per person per month.  \n ", "62   Appendix 12 \nTable A12.2: Approximate Schedule for Resettlement Efforts \n \nActivity  Time \n   \nConsultations with affected people, local authorities, and district  Ongoing \nirrigation office \n   \nDetailed resettlement planning and social preparation including a  6 months prior to construction \ncomplete census of households eligible for entitlements (names \nof households and claimed land areas recorded by the PMO) \nprior to loan effectiveness \n   \nFinalization of new land site  3 months prior to construction \n   \nResettlement  1 month prior to construction (condition for civil \nworks commencement on settling basin)  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nI.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n24.  The PMO will implement a detailed monitoring and evaluation plan for the entire Project, \nincluding preparation, implementation, and after-effects. With regard to resettlement, the PMO \nwill develop baseline data for monitoring indicators including: amount of land lost; amount of \nreplacement  land  (of  similar  or  better  quality);  number  of  jobs  provided  (temporary  and \npermanent); compensation payments; and other assistance for moving, training, and tracking of \nhousehold incomes (or agricultural incomes or output value). In support of these activities, \naffected persons will be invited to attend public meetings to discuss issues regarding the \nresettlement. The Executing Agency will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB on the \nimplementation of the resettlement plan and a resettlement completion report.  \n \nJ.  Conclusion \n25.  The overall philosophy and thrust of the resettlement plan is to ensure that the nine \nhouseholds cultivating the 6.5 ha without titles will be fully compensated for any economic, \nsocial, or institutional distress they may suffer as a result of the construction of the settling basin \nbenefiting approximately 17,700 ha. The resettlement plan is designed to ensure that these nine \nhouseholds are in no way adversely affected by their cultivation on the government land. \n   "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041223093856+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041119174743+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R250-04", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
