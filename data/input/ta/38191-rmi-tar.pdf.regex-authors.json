Since 1996, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been helping the Government of \nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) improve public sector efficiency and effectiveness.1 \nTwo 2005 technical assistance (TA) projects helped increase public ownership of and demand \nfor a more effective education system2 and assess the feasibility of a youth social service \nproject.3 Another TA project is providing advisory services for policymaking related to the \namended  Compact  of  Free  Association  and  for  medium-term  budgeting  facilitated  by  the \nEconomic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office, Office of the President.4 The RMI is also \nparticipating  in  a  regional  TA  project  to  institutionalize  civil-society  participation  in  poverty \nreduction.5 The proposed TA will pilot a new approach to improving public sector efficiency and \neffectiveness through public sector personnel audit with community involvement.   \n  \n2.  ADB fact-finding missions were fielded from 31 May to 6 June 2005, and 1\u20137 November \n2005.6 The Government and ADB reached an understanding on the goals, purpose, scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, and financing arrangements during TA preparation. The \nproject framework is in Appendix 1.7  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.   The RMI faces high unemployment and population growth. The country has not been \nable to keep pace with demand for education, social services, and jobs. The rapid shift to a \nmodern economy has weakened traditional support structures and transformed social norms, \nleaving many youths trapped between cultures, increasing the likelihood of making undesirable \nchoices with respect to lifestyle, sexual behavior, alcohol and drug use, and participation in \nyouth gangs and crime.  \n \n4.  The population is young, with over 64% under the age of 24. The school dropout rate is \nalmost 70%. The RMI has the highest incidence of teenage pregnancy per capita in the Pacific, \nincreasing by about 22% in 2002\u20132004. Most crimes are alcohol related and committed by \nyoung men; violence is becoming more prevalent and youth gangs are now part of the urban \nlandscape. Of particular concern is that while the RMI ranks highest among eight Pacific islands \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1996.

Manila (TA 6170-RE), \n6  The  missions  comprised  Clay  Wescott,  principal  regional  cooperation  specialist,  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department; and Steve Pollard, principal economist and RMI desk officer, Pacific Department (first \nmission only). \n7  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 April 2005 as Developing the Civil Service and \nRationalizing the Government's Assets. \n ", "2   \nin spending for education, education outcomes are much lower than desired.8 The Government \nis meeting these challenges, including by (i) taking a more organized approach to education \nsector strategy development and implementation by, among others, preparing annual sector \nportfolios  and  quarterly  and/or  annual  reports  that  measure  performance;  (ii)  increasing \ninvestment in education and youth services; and (iii) increasing civil society participation, linking \ncitizens with the Government and with schools and other service providers.9 To support these \nefforts, the Government has requested assistance for (i) personnel performance audits, based \non a recommendation arising from the recently concluded TA 4458-RMI (footnote 2); and (ii) \ndevelopment of a youth-at-risk work program and strategic plan, based on a recommendation \narising from the recently concluded TA 4219-RMI (footnote 3). \n   \n5.  The  Government  has  requested  assistance  from  ADB,  following  broad  stakeholder \nconsultations carried out from December 2003 to February 2004, to update the country strategy \nand program of assistance to the RMI. These consultations included all government ministries \nand agencies as well as representatives of the private sector, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), and other members of civil society. The consensus was that the top priority for TA was \ncivil service reform and government asset rationalization.10 Civil service reform has had only \nlimited success. Thus, after consulting ADB representatives in November 2005, ADB and the \nGovernment decided on a focused approach to develop and implement personnel performance \naudits as a building block for broader civil service reforms. This parallels ongoing performance-\nbased planning and budgeting reforms. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The expected impact is (i) the collaborative design and society-endorsed delivery of \ninitial pilot Ministry of Education (MOE) personnel performance audits leading to improved \nemployee productivity, and (ii) more effective delivery of youth-at-risk welfare services through \ncontinued out-sourcing to civil society organizations. The TA\u2019s outcome will be a measurable \nimprovement in the quality and quantity of education and youth services, and value-added to the \ncitizens, government employees, and others who provide education and youth services. Youths, \nparents, community leaders, Government and private education and youth service providers, \nNGOs, and other stakeholders will be asked their views on education and youth service delivery. \nThe research design will include service effectiveness and other variables to compare results \nover time and to benchmark these and future performance audits and out-sourced youth-at-risk \nwelfare services in similarly targeted projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n7.  The  TA  will  focus  on  developing  and  applying  the  methodology  for  (i)  personnel \nperformance audits and (ii) youth-at-risk service delivery in coordination with National Training \nCouncil (NTC). The pilot audits will be carried out by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG), \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006. Juumemmej: Republic of the Marshall Islands Social and Economic Report 2005. Manila. (Figure 6.1, \np. 106). \n9 The Government's response thus addresses the three service delivery accountability chains: (i) voice, linking \ncitizens  with  politicians  and/or  policy  makers;  (ii)  compact,  linking  politicians  and/or  policy  makers  with \norganizations and/or frontline providers; and (iii) client power, linking citizens with frontline service providers. See \nWorld Bank. 2004. World Development Report 2004. Washington DC. \n10 See ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Republic of the Marshall Islands. Manila. \n ", "  3\nwith support from TA consultants. Youth-at-risk services will support NTC and its work with \nNGOs and other nongovernment service providers. TA will include development and delivery of \ntraining workshops and related activities on the design of personnel performance audit and \nmethods of implementation, the nature of the personnel appeals process, and approaches to \nproviding outplacement services for employees terminated for cause. This work will include \npublic consultation and community involvement, in cooperation with the Government, the Public \nServices  Commission,  and  other  Government  agencies.  The  work  will  be  divided,  with \nperformance-based budgeting led by the Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office and \npersonnel performance auditing by OAG already being planned with support from the United \nStates Department of Agriculture. The TA will also help NTC design and implement a strategic \napproach  to  delivering  welfare  services  to  youth  at  risk  by  outsourcing  to  nongovernment \nproviders.  Consultants  will  coordinate  all  project  activity  with  the  Government  and  other \ndevelopment partners to encourage development and delivery of improved public services and \nactivities. \n \n8.  Workshops and training modules on design and implementation of the performance \naudit system will be delivered by consultants directly, or under contract with qualified providers, \nto the Government.  \n \n9.  Although personnel performance audits will be designed and implemented mainly by \nOAG and the targeted government bodies, the consultants will work closely with knowledgeable, \ncommitted, and closely involved community leaders and organizations to identify problems and \nhelp solve them using public and private providers. Public sector employee productivity and the \nmeans to improve public service delivery and outcomes cannot be addressed in isolation from \nthe  family  and  community.  While  the  Government  can  implement  an  effective  personnel \nperformance audit system, implementing the audits\u2019 recommendations will be a major challenge. \nA  long-term,  targeted,  sector-wide  approach  that  involves  government  and  nongovernment \nagencies, community leaders, churches, and particularly parents and young people working as \npartners, is fundamental to reversing underperformance in first, education and youth services \nand later other public services. The long-term, sector-wide approach needs to be designed and \nthis design should be based on proven community support and government implementation. \nHence the need to pilot the approach. \n \n10.  The TA will also examine the potential to establish and implement a reward system for \nindividual and/or group initiatives to improve education and youth-at-risk services. TA 4458-RMI \nand TA 4219-RMI (footnotes 2 and 3) have demonstrated that the RMI has significant capability \nto develop strong community self-reliance in improving education and youth-at-risk services.  \n \n11.  The pilot personnel performance audits will feed into systems for measuring, monitoring, \nand reporting on performance and results of education and youth service delivery, including \nexisting  quarterly  and  annual  performance  reports,  with  support  from  consultants  (see \nimplementation arrangements). \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $350,000, of which $250,000 will be financed by \nADB. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The RMI Office of the Chief Secretary will be the Executing Agency. OAG will carry out \nthe pilot personnel performance audits, with support from TA consultants. OAG's independence \nwill be safeguarded as provided in the constitution, and conformity to section 908 of the Laws of \nthe RMI ensured. NTC will carry out a new strategy to deliver welfare services to youth at risk by \noutsourcing to nongovernment agencies. The TA will be administered in close coordination with \nthe Ministry of Education and NTC. Other participants may include local NGOs and other \norganizations and entities (e.g., church and community action groups) that develop and deliver \npublic services. The project will last for 1 year, beginning in June 2006.  \n \n14.  International  (5  person\u2013months,  intermittent)  and  domestic  (3  person\u2013months, \nintermittent) consultants will design, test, refine, and deliver the initial pilot MOE personnel \nperformance audits (see methodology and activities), including training workshops and a youth-\nat-risk services strategy and work program. They will design and execute the project monitoring \nmethodology  with  clearly  specified  means  for  data  collection,  analysis,  comparison,  and \nbenchmarking against the results and findings from analysis of personnel performance audit \nand youth-at-risk welfare programs in other countries. Data will be gathered from the public \nservice community using statistically sound and appropriate sampling techniques. Results will \nbe vetted widely within the Government and by public service users.  \n \n15.  Consultants will require skills, including extensive work experience in designing, testing, \nevaluating, and delivering personnel performance audit systems and processes, and in building \nstakeholder support to improve public service delivery (see methodology and key activities, and \nimplementation arrangements). Consultants will be employed on an intermittent basis. Expected \nresults from the TA team are as follows: (i) visit or quarterly interim written reports and formal \nbriefings by telephone and in person to the Government, and to ADB on results and outcomes \nbeginning 1 month after the project starts; and (ii) a final report to ADB upon project completion \nin May 2007, specifying in qualitative and quantitative terms all project results, outputs, and \noutcomes,  including  comparison  and  benchmarking  analysis  of  project  findings  to  results \nderived from personnel performance audit work in other jurisdictions. The final report will also \ninclude recommendations for further ADB-sponsored work in personnel performance audit in the \nGovernment, and other possible civil service reforms to improve education and youth services. \n \n16.  Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB as individuals in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nEquipment will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement, and the \nequipment will be turned over to the Government upon the TA's conclusion. \n \n17.  Project  outputs  and  outcome  evaluation  will  be  disseminated  through  ADB  reports;  \npublications such as academic journals, magazines, and other outlets that publish material on \nperformance auditing; and the RMI media, including television. Material drawn from report \nresults and outcomes will be made available on the ADB website and CD ROMs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Marshall Islands for Pilot Collaborative Public Services Delivery, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix  1 5\n   \nAPPENDIX 1: DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nCollaborative design  \u2022  Citizen satisfaction  \u2022  Compact annual reports  \u2022  Sustained political will to \nand society-endorsed  \u2022  Initial improvement  from target ministries  support the pilot \ndelivery of initial pilot  of test scores; fewer  and agencies  personnel performance \nMOE performance  youths failing in  \u2022  RMI statistical yearbook  audit system and \naudits and delivery of  school  \u2022  Citizen surveys  delivery of youth-at-risk \nyouth-at-risk welfare  \u2022  Initial improvement  \u2022  NGO reports  services by NGOs and \nservices in the  in other youth    businesses \nGovernment   welfare indicators  \u2022  Support of PSC for the \nperformance audit \n\u2022  Support of the Ministry \nof Internal Affairs for \nNTC management of \nyouth-at-risk services \n \nOutcomes      Assumptions \n\u2022  Initial  \u2022  Measures of  \u2022  Compact annual reports  \u2022  Political will and \nimprovements in  increased employee  from target ministries  Government  support \nthe performance of  productivity and  and agencies,  \u2022  High priority for civil \nMOE   employee attrition as  especially education  service reform \n\u2022  Public service  a result of personnel  \u2022  RMI statistical  \u2022  Increased funding from \nstakeholder interest  performance audit  yearbooks  the Government and \ngroups formed and  \u2022  5% increase in early  \u2022  Citizen surveys  other partners \noperating  childhood enrollment  \u2022  NGO reports  \u2022  Continued support for \n\u2022  Fully functioning  \u2022  Increased school    and growth of \nNTC managing the  attendance of 6\u201318- nongovernment and \noutsourcing to  year-olds  business programs for \nnongovernment  \u2022  Higher test scores   youths at risk \nprovision of welfare   \nservices for youth   Risks \nat risk  \u2022  Lack of support from the \npolitical system and in \nthe target ministries \n\u2022  Lack of support for \nperformance audit and \nstakeholder interest \ngroups among civil \nsociety and interest \ngroups \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

General \n \n1.  The team of international and domestic consultants should have advanced degrees in the \ndisciplines  appropriate  to  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  work,  with  well-developed  skills  and \nexperience in program and workshop design and delivery, qualitative and quantitative analysis, \nand social intervention. The international consultants should have skills and experience in using \nperformance audit systems and in delivering education and youth-at-risk government services in \nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), the Pacific region, and/or other developing nations. \nExperience in Micronesia and the Pacific Islands area is the most desirable. The international \nconsultants should also have experience in establishing personnel performance audit systems for \neducation and in delivering youth welfare and social services. The domestic consultants should \nhave  experience  of  delivering  education,  youth  welfare  and  social  services  in  the  RMI.  All \nconsultants should be community oriented and have experience in the culture, mores, folkways, \nand customs of developing nations, preferably in the Pacific region. They should especially have \nexperience  in  working  with  governments  in  developing  nations  and,  preferably,  in  the  RMI. \nInternational  consultants  should  have  specific  expertise  in  performance  auditing  and  related \nmethods for improving public services. Skills and experience in training workshop design and \ndelivery, and familiarity with performance auditing in developing countries are required, as well as \nextensive experience in education and youth policy and development. The team will work with and \nreport to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the RMI Office of the President, and work with \nthe Ministry of Education (MOE) and the National Training Council (NTC). Continuous consultation \nand coordination is needed with other agencies, including the Office of the Auditor General, the \nPublic Services Commission, Ministry of Finance, NTC, and others. The TA will particularly, but not \nexclusively,  target  underperforming  and  improperly  employed  public  servants,  to  increase \nproductivity through skills building and other innovative programmatic initiatives. \n \n2.  The  pilot  project  will  address  issues  within  a  strategic  framework  that  matches  the \nGovernment performance audit and education system plans and strategy. The project will also take \nnote of TA findings in (i) the draft final report on Increasing Ownership and Effective Demand for \nImproved Education: A Pilot Project in Civil Service Reform and Government Asset Rationalization; \nand (ii) youth social services.1  \n \n3.  The team leader will submit a brief inception report 1 month after the TA starts, establishing \nTA milestones and time-bound output agreed on with the Government and ADB. Interim reports \nwill  be  submitted  quarterly  to  ADB  and  the  Government,  and  comprehensive  reports  will  be \nprepared and delivered to ADB and the Government when the pilot project is completed. A detailed \ndraft project proposal, including costing, will also be developed by the team and submitted to ADB \nand the Government at the end of this pilot project. \n \nB.  International Consultant: Team Leader (3 person-months, intermittent) \n \n4.  The project team leader will first identify and prioritize the strategy and means for personnel \nperformance auditing in MOE, determining focal areas and strategic interventions. The project will \ninclude development of a 1-year program for performance auditing in MOE and the Government, \nidentifying costs over the year. The team leader's specific tasks will include the following: \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Develop a pilot project strategic plan to implement \npersonnel performance audits, including (a) cost estimates of new programs and \ninitiatives, (b) program development and delivery required to improve effectiveness, \nand (c) a preliminary budget to develop and deliver new programs and initiatives.  \n \n(ii)  TA  implementation  should  be  clearly  phased  over  1  year.  Phases  will  be \nimplemented only after successful completion of prior ones.  \n \n(iii)  Design research to collect longitudinal and cross-sectional data to measure the \nquantity, quality, and effectiveness of current service employee productivity. The \ndata will establish a baseline for comparison with data collected before, during, and \nafter project delivery.
