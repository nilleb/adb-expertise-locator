The adverse impact on poverty reduction and economic growth for Bangladesh as a \nresult of widespread corruption has been highlighted through a number of studies on the effects \nof corruption.1 Promoting anticorruption as part of good governance is therefore an important \nelement  of  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda.2    The  Government  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support its anticorruption initiatives, and technical assistance (TA) \nis included in the TA program for 2003. An ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Bangladesh in \nMarch 2003 and had detailed discussions with the Government, representatives of civil society, \nand aid agencies on the TA, including its purpose and output, methodology and key activities, \ncost estimates, and terms of reference.3 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nISSUES \n2.  To support and channel the growing recognition of the significance of anticorruption in \nBangladesh into a credible strategy requires initiatives that provide for (i) economic and poverty \nimpact, by being undertaken in a potentially dynamic segment of the economy where anti \ncorruption initiatives could materially benefit economic growth and reduce poverty; (ii) systemic \nimpact, by replacing the troubling nexus between public and private sector corruption by a \nprivate-public partnership on anticorruption; (iii) an effective institutional focus to anticorruption \nefforts;  and  (iv)  a  collective,  balanced,  and  sectorally  implementable  focus  on  corruption \nprevention. Such a strategy is designed to overcome the limitations of a fragmented, piecemeal \napproach  and  the  lack  of  sector  leverage  for  a  governance  program  in  a  challenging \ngovernance climate like Bangladesh. \n \n3.  The secured financing4 sector is regarded as one of the most potentially dynamic \nsegments of the economy in Bangladesh. Secured financing institutions extending credit against \nmovable  property  collateral,  including  nonbank  financial  institutions  like  lease  financing \ncompanies, are as yet a small but growing part of the credit market.5 Small and medium sized \nenterprise  debtors  with  relatively  little  land  but  more  movable  property  collateral  are  an \nimportant potential growth engine for the Bangladesh economy. Even if debtors and creditors \nbenefit from a reformed secured transactions regime in terms of enhanced credit delivery, there \nis a need to ensure that their true dynamic impact on the economy in Bangladesh is not \nhindered  by  corruption.  As  such,  support  for  improved  containment  of  corruption  through \n                                \n \n1  A. Rahman, G. Kisunko, K. Kapoor. 2000.  Estimating the Effects of Corruption, World Bank Policy Research \nWorking  Paper  2479.  Washington,  DC,  indicating  that  Bangladesh  is  the  sixth  most  corrupt nation in its \nInternational Country Risk Guide (ICRG) among 123 countries. The World Bank paper indicated that an increase of \nBangladesh\u2019s ICRG from 1.76 to 5 would result in an annual gross national product (GNP) per capita growth of \n5.5% instead of 3.4%. P. Mauro. 1997. Why Worry About Corruption?, International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nEconomic Issues No. 6.  Washington, DC, noting that, if the corruption index improves by one standard deviation, \nthe investment rate increases by more than 4 percentage points and the annual growth rate of per capita gross \ndomestic product (GDP) increases by over half a percentage point. \n2  Memorandum for Bangladesh Development Forum 2002-2003 and the governance pillar of the Government\u2019s  \nNational Strategy for Economic Growth, Poverty Reduction, and Social Development, which is the Government\u2019s \nInterim Poverty Reduction Strategy (I-PRS). \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 April 2003. \n4  Secured financing means financing against movable property collateral like equipment, vehicles, shares, software, \nand other property that is not land. \n5  Although the Bangladesh credit market is still overdependent on bank credit (approximately 27% of gross domestic \nproduct [GDP] as of FY2002) as compared with nonbank credit (approximately 3% of GDP as of FY2002), there is \nsubstantial  opportunity  for  growth  of  nonbank  financial  institutions  as  indicated  by  the  increasing  number \nregistering under the Financial Institutions Act of 1993 and by the growth rate of leasing companies. ", "2 \nsecured financing governance could materially promote economic growth and reduce poverty in \nBangladesh. \n \n4.  The notion that a credible anticorruption strategy needs to address both the private and \npublic sector is evident from ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy.6 Consequently, the harnessing of \nprivate sector secured financing institutions into a partnership with public sector anticorruption \nefforts through the medium of secured financing anticorruption initiatives would be a critical \ncomponent of an overall anticorruption strategy for Bangladesh that avoids a bias towards \npublic sector anticorruption alone. \n \n5.  A reformed legal framework for secured financing could provide critical systemic impact \nto anticorruption in several important respects. For example, enabling secured creditors to \nstatutorily trace movable property collateral that is converted into cash or other assets will foster \nthe development of forensic accounting techniques. This would benchmark forensic accounting \nin public sector corruption prevention under legislation like the Anti Money Laundering Act \nenacted by Bangladesh in 2002.7 Transparency of public registration and self-enforcement \nrather than relying on a congested public court system would drive private sector creditors and \ndebtors away from nontransparent and corrupt methods of settlement of dues. \n \n6.  Promoting  the  sensitivity  of  secured  financing  institutions  to  corrupt  transactions \ninvolving movable assets of clients through self-regulatory governance indicators based on \ngovernance surveys would make secured financing institutions more quickly responsive to \ninitiatives to prevent public sector corruption, which may require speedy disclosure of bank \naccounts or freezing of accounts. \n \n7.  Apart from the economic and systemic impact of anticorruption initiatives through the \nsecured financing sector, an effective strategy also needs to have an independent institutional \nfocus for public sector anticorruption. The current Bureau of Anti Corruption has to seek \npermission  from  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office,  often  long  delayed,  for  investigations  and \nprosecutions. This potentially lends itself to politically motivated prosecution of corruption, which \nadversely affects the credibility of anticorruption efforts. Consequently, there is a need for \ndesign of a more credible institutional focus on public sector anticorruption that provides for \nintegrity, independence, and effectiveness. \n \n8.  Finally,  the  development  of  a  credible  anticorruption  strategy  needs  to  focus  in \noperational terms on prevention of corruption. The notion that prevention is better than cure \nreflects the emerging view on anticorruption.8 The establishment, let alone operationalization, of \nan independent institutional focus takes time. In addition, the gradual development of effective, \nbalanced corruption prevention will be time consuming in developing countries, which do not \nhave  long-established  anticorruption  commissions  with  a  mature  cooperative  relationship \nbetween the public and private sectors on corruption prevention. Consequently, appropriate \nhigh level support for corruption prevention operations through balanced coordination of existing \nanticorruption agencies and sector-specific implementation in line ministries is critical. \n                                \n \n6  ADB. 1998.

The objective of the TA is to support an integrated anticorruption strategy in Bangladesh \nthrough a combination of legal, registry, and private institutional anticorruption initiatives in the \nsecured financing sector of private credit markets complemented by public sector anticorruption \ninitiatives focused on institutional and corruption prevention operations.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  comprise  two  parts.  Part  A  will  support  secured  financing  sector  anti \ncorruption initiatives, and Part B will support public sector anticorruption initiatives. \n11.  The first component under Part A of the TA will entail assistance for legal reform on (i) \nconsensus building for a modern legal framework for secured transactions, (ii) finalization of a \nnew  draft  secured  transactions  law  for  Bangladesh,9  and  (iii)  harmonization  of  a  modern \nsecured transactions regime with other laws.10 Based on the foundation of a modern secured \ntransactions law, this component will also support the development of the overall architecture for \na transparent, electronic registration system.11 \n \n12.  The  second  component  under  Part  A  will  support  institutional  governance  through \ngovernance  surveys  of  a  cross  section  of  secured  financing  institutions.  The  governance \nsurveys  are  designed  to  develop  tailored  governance  indicators  on  rules,  processes,  and \npractices in core governance competencies for self-regulatory certification of secured financing \ninstitutions. Core governance competencies to be developed through governance surveys are \nintegrity12 and accountability.13 \n \n13.  Finally, Part A will also support training and one study visit to a modern registry system \nfor all the above-mentioned components of the TA. Such training will entail consultants, in \nconsultation with the Ministry of Finance, designing and carrying out a comprehensive training \nprogram of workshops, seminars, and registry training sessions that encompass both the draft \nlaw and the prospective registration system. Training will target relevant government officials, \nlawyers, and other stakeholders. \n \n14.  The first component of Part B of the TA will support the establishment of an independent \nanticorruption  commission  (IACC).  This  will  entail  (i)  consensus  building  on  the  nature, \nobjectives,  mandate,  and  structure  of  IACC;  (ii)  associated  drafting  of  a  statute,  rules, \n                                \n \n9  This includes review of a previous draft law prepared by the United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID) and others. \n10  These include laws relating to other existing movables registries, leasing companies, and debtor protection. \n11 Full development of a registry will be considered under future ADB financial sector projects in Bangladesh. \n12 The integrity component will include consideration of indicators on (i) integrity rules, such as codes of conduct, and \ncodes of disciplinary procedure; (ii) integrity infrastructure, such as availability of specialist staff for an integrity unit, \nrules and procedures like hotlines, whistleblower programs, and integrity register actions; and (iii) integrity training \nwith \u201ctrain the trainers\u201d models, case studies on potential breaches of codes, reporting obligations on breaches, \nand penalties for violations of codes. \n13 The accountability component will include consideration of indicators for accountability for different risks (credit risk, \nforeign exchange risk, asset/liability risk, and statute-based compliance risk like the Anti Money Laundering Act \n2002) to owners, regulators, and customers in terms of (i) management of operations, (ii) data compilation and \nmanagement, and (iii) allocation of human and other resources. ", "4 \nregulations, and procedures;14 (iii) public dissemination and consultation with stakeholders on \nIACC, the law, rules, regulations, and procedures related to it and the ensuing anticorruption \nstrategy of the Government; and (iv) formulation of the Government\u2019s anticorruption strategy. \n \n15.  The  second  component  of  Part  B  will  support  a  national  committee  on  corruption \nprevention (NCCP), which will (i) examine the need for changes to or improved enforcement of \nsubstantive  laws,  rules,  and  regulations;15  (ii)  facilitate  a  collective  cross-verification  by \ninvestigative and regulatory agencies that will enable more integrated and balanced prevention \nof  corruption  by  the  Government;  and  (iii)  seek  feedback  from  civil  society  and  other \nstakeholders on the output of the proposed NCCP. \n \n16.  The third component of Part B will support prevention of institutional corruption in line \nministries through governance audits,16 which will result in indicators for implementing rules, \nregulations, procedures, and mechanisms17 for corruption prevention in line ministries. Access \nto line ministries will be obtained as needed after consultation with NCCP. \n \n17.  Finally, Part B will also support preparation of training and capacity building for IACC, \nNCCP,  and  line  ministry  corruption  prevention  through  (i)  a  train-the-trainers  corruption \nprevention program; (ii) initial training, including through two external study visits in the region, \nfor specialist skills required in line ministries for corruption prevention (such as monitoring and \nevaluation for forensic accounting and auditing, and administrative review); and (iii) time-bound \nphasing  of  activities  for  corruption  prevention-related  training  programs  with  estimates  of \nrequired resources and identification of possible sources for such resources.18 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The  TA,  estimated  at  $1,187,500  equivalent,  includes  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of \n$832,000 and $355,500 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will finance $700,000 equivalent \non a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program and will administer $250,000 equivalent \nfinanced on a grant basis from the Governance Cooperation Fund. ADB will thereby finance the \nentire foreign exchange cost and $118,000 equivalent of the local currency cost of the TA. The \nGovernment will provide a total of $237,500 equivalent to finance part of the local currency cost \nto cover counterpart staff, office facilities, administrative support, and other expenses such as \nfor in-country study facilitation. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix \n2. \n \n \n                                \n \n14 Draft rules, regulations, and procedures will include performance accountability, incentives structures, and a \nstrategic plan. The Government has assigned the principal secretary, Prime Minister\u2019s Office and secretary, \nFinance the task of preparing a draft act for an IACC with the assistance of the Ministry of Law for introduction in \nthe budget session in 2003. \n15 This will include considering statutory provisions on prohibition of benami transactions (those undertaken in \nsomeone else\u2019s name) and on effectiveness of asset freezing under Section 11(1) of the Anti Money Laundering \nAct 2002, and overriding of bank secrecy under Sections 4 and 5 of the Anti Money Laundering Act of 2002 and \nSection 113(f) of the Income Tax Ordinance of 1984.  \n16 Reinikka and Svensson. 2003.  Survey Techniques to Measure and Explain Corruption, World Bank Policy \nResearch Working Paper 3071. Washington DC.  This was published in June 2003.   Governance audits will \ninclude public expenditure tracking surveys. \n17 This will include rules, regulations, and procedures on recruitment, administrative review mechanisms, and public \nexpenditure tracking systems. \n18 Line ministries that actively participate in corruption prevention under the TA will be given preference for training \nopportunities. ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The Finance Division, Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for Part A \nof the TA. A senior official of the Finance Division will be designated as the project director for \nPart A. The Finance Division will need to assign counterpart staff to work closely with the Part A \nconsultants. A steering committee will be established for this part of the TA, to be chaired by the \nsecretary,  Finance  with  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Ministry  of  Law, \nsecured financing institutions, chambers of commerce, and other stakeholders. The steering \ncommittee will monitor and guide implementation of Part A of the TA; resolve issues that may \narise in the process of executing the TA; be responsible for screening candidates for seminars, \nworkshops, and training; and consider Part A TA consultant reports. \n \n20.  The Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) will be the Executing Agency for Part B of the TA, \nand a senior level official will be the project director, with counterpart staff being assigned by the \nPMO to work with the Part B consultants. A steering committee will be established for this part \nof  the  TA,  to  be  chaired  by  the  principal  secretary,  PMO  with  representatives  from  the \nComptroller and Auditor General, Ministry of Law, and anticorruption agencies, and invitees \nfrom line ministries who are actively participating in the program. The steering committee\u2019s \nresponsibilities will include consideration of the reports of the Part B TA consultants, and \nmonitoring and guiding implementation of Part B. \n \n21.  ADB will engage a team of individual consultants for Part A of the TA to provide \nconsulting services for a total of 16 person-months. Consultants\u2019 input will comprise 12 person-\nmonths of international and 4 person-months of domestic consultants, consisting of (i) a secured \ntransactions expert (legal) (international, 4 person-months); (ii) a secured transactions expert \n(registry)  (international,  4  person-months);  (iii)  a  secured  financing  governance  expert \n(international, 4 person-months); and (iv) a legal expert (domestic, 4 person-months). ADB will \nalso engage a firm of international consultants for Part B to provide consulting services. Input \nwill comprise 17 person-months of international consultants and 15 person-months of domestic \nconsultants consisting of (i) a team leader/governance audit expert (international, 6 person-\nmonths); (ii) a deputy team leader/forensic accounting expert (international, 6 person-months); \n(iii)  an  anti  corruption  commission  legal  expert  (international,  5  person-months);  (iv)  an \nadministrative review and legal expert (domestic, 5 person-months); (v) an accounting expert \n(domestic,  5  person-months);  and  (vi)  a  training  expert  (domestic,  5  person-months).  All \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The simplified technical proposal procedure and quality-based selection (QBS) will \nbe used for Part B. QBS will be used because of the sensitivity of specialist skills required. \nOutline  terms  of  reference  are  attached  in  Appendix  3.  Equipment  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  TA  is  planned  to  commence  in \nOctober 2003, and its expected completion date is May 2004, a period of 8 months. \n \n   THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.
