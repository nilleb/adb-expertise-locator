INTRODUCTION \n1.  In a consultation process conducted in 2007 on behalf of the Global Environment Facility \n(GEF) Pacific Alliance for Sustainability, five Pacific developing member countries (DMCs)\u2014the \nCook  Islands,  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG),  Samoa,  Tonga,  and  Vanuatu\u2014expressed  keen \ninterest in, and assigned high priority to, reducing their consumption of fossil fuels. In response, \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved regional technical assistance (TA) for Promoting \nEnergy  Efficiency  in  the  Pacific  to  provide  preliminary  assistance  to  reduce  fossil  fuel \nconsumption in these five DMCs through demand-side energy efficiency assessment.1 Work \nunder the TA has identified a significant pipeline of activities for promoting energy efficiency. \nImplementation of this pipeline in the five DMCs will be the focus of the proposed regional \ncapacity development TA. \n \n2.  An application for cofinancing was made to the GEF2 based on analysis and data \ngathered  under  the  previous  TA,  and  the  project  identification  form  was  approved  on \n10 September 2009.3 An ADB fact-finding mission undertaken between July and September \n2010 discussed the proposed TA with government and local stakeholders. An understanding \nwas reached with the governments on the purpose, components, cost estimates and financing, \nand implementation arrangements of the TA. 4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Pacific DMCs are extremely vulnerable to the cost of imported fossil fuels. The Cook \nIslands, Tonga, and Vanuatu have electricity generation systems that rely almost exclusively on \nfossil fuel (diesel) power generation, and electricity tariffs across the region are very high, with \nactual residential tariffs ranging from $0.22 per kilowatt-hour in PNG to $0.46 per kilowatt-hour \nin the Cook Islands. Paying for imported fossil fuels places a major strain on local economies \nand trade balances. Pacific DMC economies are already under strong pressure to meet urgent \nnational, social, development, and environmental needs, while being economically reliant on \nlimited exports of uncertain value (e.g., copra), remittances from overseas, tourism, and foreign \naid. Fossil fuels are a major cost that Pacific DMCs have little control over, and the volatility and \nhigh  level  of  oil-based  fossil  fuel  prices  is  a  threat  to  the  ongoing  social,  economic,  and \nenvironmental development and sustainability of these countries. \n \n4.  The  development  and  use  of  conventional  energy  significantly  contributes  to  the \naccumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and associated climate change impacts. \nAlthough  the  accumulation  of  greenhouse  gases  is  largely  the  result  of  energy  use  by \ndeveloped countries, the high vulnerability of small islands and low-lying atolls to the impacts of \nclimate change has created very strong interest in addressing the problem within Pacific DMCs. \nHence, Pacific DMCs are among the most active countries supporting deep global greenhouse \ngas emission reductions, and one means by which they may show their tangible support is to \nmanage their own greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n5.  Pacific DMCs benefit from a wide variety of projects funded by development partners in \nthe  energy field.  However, most  projects  have focused  on more  visible  renewable  energy \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2008. Regional Technical Assistance for Promoting Energy Efficiency in the Pacific. Manila. \n2   GEF secretariat project identification number is 3641. The application was made to GEF-4 under the climate \nchange focal area: Strategic Program 1: Energy Efficiency in Buildings. \n3   A GEF-funded project preparatory grant for $200,000 was approved on 1 March 2010 and was used to further \ndefine the scope of this follow-on TA, under a change in scope of the previous TA. \n4   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 8 October 2010. \n ", "2   \napplications,  with  only  some  sporadic  energy  efficiency  activities.5 Past  energy  efficiency \nactivities (including ADB regional TA)6 have comprised studies of energy-saving potentials and \nthe  provision  of  policy  and  advisory  assistance,  and  have  generally  lacked  a  tangible \nimplementation focus relating to capacity building and catalyzing the deployment of energy \nefficient  appliances  and  equipment.  For  example,  the  following  have  been  undertaken:  (i) \nenergy audit training and energy audits, but without a link to accessing financing mechanisms to \nimplement the findings; (ii) household surveys, but without a proper energy end-use focus and \nwithout assembling the information into usable end-use databases; and (iii) studies of the \npotential for minimum energy performance standards and energy labeling for appliances, but \nwithout identified funding paths to implement findings. \n \n6.  There  have  also  been  few  efforts  to  stimulate  the  sector  using  innovative  energy \nefficiency  technologies.  Significant  potential  exists  to  catalyze  the  use  of  energy  efficient \nequipment,  including  (i)  long  lasting,  voltage-variation-tolerant  compact  fluorescent  lamps; \n(ii) long  lasting,  low-power  streetlamps,  such  as  light-emitting  diodes;  (iii)  modern  linear \nfluorescent fittings with low-loss ballasts and reflector diffusers; and (iv) high part-load efficiency \ninverter air conditioners. Finally, there has been no effort to ensure that new buildings are \nconstructed to be energy efficient through practical energy efficiency provisions in applicable \nbuilding codes. Therefore, there is large potential for implementation-focused energy efficiency \nactivities. \n \n7.  Efficient energy use is compromised due to a number of factors, including (i) insufficient \npublic understanding and awareness of the potential of energy efficiency initiatives; (ii) lack of \nconfidence among stakeholders in energy efficiency technologies due to the limited success of \ndemonstration programs; (iii) inadequate institutional capacities and technical expertise to plan, \nmanage, and maintain energy efficiency programs; (iv) lack of clear energy efficiency policies, \nlegislation, regulatory frameworks, and enforcement; and (v) limited political commitment and \nfinancial support to the sector. The project will address these limitations by prioritizing the \nestablishment  of  appropriate  institutional  arrangements;  implementing  suitable  policy  and \nlegislative  support;  collecting,  analyzing,  and  disseminating  energy  data  required  for \nidentification  and  monitoring  of  demand-side  efficiency  improvements;  and  implementing \nnational energy efficiency programs and public awareness campaigns. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  will  be  reduction  in  fossil  fuel  use  by  the  power  sector  without  a \ncorresponding reduction in energy services in the five participating DMCs. The outcome will be \nthat  end  consumers  use  power  efficiently  in  the  participating  countries.  Assuming \nmacroeconomic conditions remain stable, the initiative will reduce the energy intensity of the \neconomies in question as well as promote energy security and reductions in greenhouse gas \nemissions from the power sector. The TA will also lead to greater affordability of energy services \nfor consumers. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n                                                \n5  P.

Through energy efficiency improvements in the residential, commercial, and government \nsectors of each country, the TA will improve the efficiency with which consumers use power. \nThe TA will develop and implement (i) a comprehensive database on energy use by sector and \nappliance; (ii) energy efficiency policies and capacity building for the government and private \nsector; and (iii) national energy efficiency programs and interventions in the public lighting; \nresidential  lighting;  and  residential,  private,  and  public  buildings.  Results  and  knowledge \nproducts will be disseminated across the region to encourage replication in other Pacific DMCs. \nTo ensure that least-cost energy efficiency initiatives are selected, financial and economic \nanalysis will be undertaken to compare the chosen solution to alternative renewable energy \noptions and supply-side efficiency improvements, as well as to the short-run marginal cost of \ndiesel power generation. Measurement targets will include simple and discounted payback \nperiod, marginal cost, and cost per kilowatt-hour.  The TA will be structured around five outputs. \n \n10.  Output 1: Stakeholder access to comprehensive information on energy use. This \noutput will complement the analysis carried out under phase 1 (footnote 1) by conducting \nsurveys  to  complete  the  picture  of  existing  and  projected  appliance  and  equipment \ncharacteristics, patterns of use, and useful lifetimes. The main output will be an accessible \ndatabase of energy use by sector and major appliance category in each country. \n \n11.  Output 2: Energy efficiency practices mainstreamed into government policies and \nprocedures.  This  output  will  involve  (i)  establishing  practical  and  implementable  energy \nefficiency targets and their incorporation into national energy policies and plans; (ii) suppressing \nsale and use of high-energy-consumption appliances and equipment through import regulations \nbrought about by the development and enforcement of effective minimum energy performance \nstandards and/or energy labeling; (iii) improving energy efficiency best practices for newly built \nresidential,  commercial,  and  government  buildings,  including  the  establishment  of  simple, \neffective, and enforceable energy efficiency provisions in building codes for new buildings; (iv) \ndeveloping and implementing training programs for local experts in undertaking energy audits \nand in providing energy efficient products and services; and (v) supporting the development of \nmotivated and organized service providers that have incentives to implement energy efficiency \nactivities. \n \n12.  Output 3: Energy efficiency programs implemented effectively and sustainably. As \nanalyzed and piloted in phase 1 (footnote 1), this output will involve a number of tangible \nimplementation initiatives, including (i) upgrading street lighting using energy efficient and long-\nlife technologies; (ii) providing energy efficient lighting systems to residential, commercial, and \ngovernment buildings; (iii) undertaking energy audits in hotels and other nonresidential private \nbuildings  and  subsequently  implementing  recommended  improvements  in  air-conditioning, \nlighting, refrigeration, water heating, and management schemes; and (iv) undertaking energy \naudits and subsequently implementing recommended improvements in government buildings. \n \n13.  Output 4: Information dissemination and improved public awareness. This output \nwill include (i) disseminating information to public and private stakeholders on the benefits of \nenergy-saving technologies and practices through public education programs, workshops, and \nmedia; and (ii) leveraging project benefits and information exchange beyond the participating \nDMCs using regional workshops, innovative information and communication technologies, and \nknowledge products in a usable format. \n \n ", "4   \n14.  Output 5: Effective project management established. This output will ensure the \nprogram of activities is implemented on time and to budget. Significant activities under this \noutput are listed in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $12,421,545 equivalent, of which (i) $1,000,000 will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV); \n(ii) $5,254,545 will be funded on a joint basis by the GEF;7 (iii) $1,000,000 will be funded on a \njoint basis by the Government of Australia;8 and (iv) $1,500,000 will be funded on a parallel \nbasis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility.9 \nAll cofinancing will be administered by ADB and will be provided on an untied grant basis. The \nfive DMC governments will contribute $2,047,000 equivalent in the form of in-kind contributions \nto finance the costs of counterpart staff, office accommodation, communication, local transport, \nconsultations, awareness facilitation, and other energy efficiency initiatives. Power utilities will \ncontribute $1,620,000 in the form of in-kind parallel financing under outputs 3 and 4 and they \nwill not act as suppliers of energy efficient equipment.10 Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix \n2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  Executing and implementing agencies. The TA will be implemented over a 4-year \nperiod commencing on 1 April 2011 and ending on 31 March 2015. ADB\u2019s Pacific Department, \nthrough the Transport, Energy and Natural Resources Division, will serve as the executing \nagency  and  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating,  supervising,  and  implementing  all  project \nactivities.
