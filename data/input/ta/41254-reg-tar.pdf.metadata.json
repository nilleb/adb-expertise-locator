INTRODUCTION \n1.  To guide its approach to mainstreaming governance and capacity development in its \noperations,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Second  Governance  and \nAnticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II)1 in July 2006 and the Medium-Term Framework and \nAction Plan for Integrating Capacity Development into Country Programs and Operations (CD \nAction  Plan) 2  in  January  2007.  The  ADB/Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and \nDevelopment  (OECD)  Anti-Corruption  Initiative  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (the  ADB/OECD \nInitiative),3 launched in 1999 to set goals and standards for sustainable safeguards against \ncorruption, has also contributed significantly to strengthening governance capacity in the region.  \n \n2.  The  first  phase  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Governance  and  Capacity \nDevelopment Initiative supported the implementation of GACAP II and the CD Action Plan, and \nprovided continuing support to the ADB/OECD Initiative.4 With GACAP II and the CD Action \nPlan  moving  beyond  the  inception  stage,  ADB  will  focus  on  consolidating  lessons  and \nmainstreaming governance and capacity development in its sector operations. The design and \nmonitoring framework for the second phase of the TA is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Under GACAP II ADB has adopted a risk-based approach to governance assessment \nand prioritizes three governance themes that are viewed as essential to poverty reduction and \ndevelopment  effectiveness:  public  financial  management,  procurement,  and  combating \ncorruption. These three themes apply at the national and subnational levels, and in ADB priority \nsectors  in  its  developing  member  countries  (DMC).  ADB  has  completed  country-level  risk \nassessments for eight DMCs6 and 17 sector-level risk assessments in eight DMCs.7 Additional \nresources and technical support are needed to assist regional departments in implementing the \nGACAP II requirements during preparation of country partnership strategies (CPS). Twelve \nCPSs are scheduled for consideration by the Board of Directors in both 2009 and 2010. \n \n4.  The first phase of the TA supported the preparation of the GACAP II guidelines,8 which \nprovide general guidance to ADB staff on the implementation of GACAP II, particularly on the \nrisk-based approach. A source book, which was also prepared under the first phase of the TA, \ncompiles existing governance tools and analytical frameworks to assist with the preparation of \ncountry-level  and  sector-level  risk  assessments. 9  During  the  next  phase  of  GACAP  II \nimplementation, the emphasis will be on more specific guidance for preparation of sector-level \nrisk assessments. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

Manila (draft). \n ", "2   \n5.  The CD Action Plan calls for capacity development to be institutionalized in ADB's \noperations through a results-based CPS, which assists DMCs in addressing priority capacity \ngaps. Resources and technical support will be required to ensure capacity assessments are \nundertaken as part of the governance risk assessment process (nationally and in priority sectors) \nfor the 24 CPSs scheduled for preparation in 2009\u20132010. Under the first phase of the TA, the \nPractical Guide to CD in a Sector Context 10 was prepared to guide staff in assessing capacity \nneeds and formulating capacity development strategies, particularly in addressing key risks to \ndevelopment effectiveness identified in country and sector governance risk assessments. In \nresponse to a request from the Government of Pakistan, ADB supported a study of public sector \ncapacity development with special reference to the delivery of pro-poor services. Study results \nwere disseminated at the third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra, Ghana in \nSeptember 2008.  \n \n6.  In preparation for the High Level Forum, more than 150 officials from 38 countries met at \nfour Asia\u2013Pacific subregional consultations. The consultations included representatives from \ndiverse ministries, civil society organizations, and development partners. The resulting Accra \nAgenda  for  Action  highlighted  the  central  role  of  capacity  development  in  meeting  the \ncommitments of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. At these consultations and the \nforum, there was resounding demand for support of national processes to localize the Paris \nDeclaration and Accra Agenda. However, countries called for support to be less event-driven, \nlonger term, and linked to country context. In response, ADB, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of \nJapan, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Bank developed \nthe  Asia\u2013Pacific  capacity  development  for  development  effectiveness  (CDDE)  program  to \nsupport  partners  as  they  implement  the  Accra  Agenda,  strengthening  their  aid  policy  and \naccelerating the achievement of development results.11  \n \n7.  The  ADB/OECD  Initiative  developed  an  anticorruption  action  plan  for  Asia  and  the \nPacific, which set goals and standards for sustainable safeguards for regional cooperation \nagainst  corruption.12 In  2001,  17  Asian  and  Pacific countries13 endorsed  the  plan,  and  an \nadditional  11  countries  and  jurisdictions14 signed  on  by  2008.  By  encouraging  continuous \nanticorruption  reforms\u2014through  research,  publications,  technical  advice,  regular  regional \nforums,  and  information  sharing\u2014the  ADB/OECD  Initiative  is  recognized  by  governments, \ndevelopment partners, civil society, and the private sector. The first phase of the TA supported \nthe initiative's biannual conference on fighting corruption in Asia and the Pacific and provided \ninitial financing for a review to assess the efficacy, continuing relevance, and future course of \nthe initiative.  \n                                                 \n10  Available: http://adbweb/Capacity-Development/default.asp \n11  The  CDDE  program  was  launched  at  ADB  on  12\u201313  March  2009  with  representatives  from  DMCs  and \ndevelopment partners. \n12 The action plan is a voluntary, legally nonbinding agreement with three pillars: (i) developing effective and \ntransparent systems for public service, (ii) strengthening anti-bribery actions and promoting integrity in business \noperations, and (iii) supporting active public involvement. The ADB/OECD Initiative's implementation and review \nmechanisms support the objectives of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the OECD Anti-\nBribery Convention in Asia and the Pacific. \n13  Bangladesh, Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kyrgyz Republic, Malaysia, \nMongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, and Vanuatu. \n14  Kazakhstan (2002); Cambodia (2003); Australia (2004); Hong Kong, China (2004); Palau (2004); Viet Nam (2004); \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (2005); Thailand (2005); Sri Lanka (2006); Macao, China (2006); and Bhutan (2007). \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA's impact will be assisting selected DMCs in responding more effectively to \ngovernance  risks  at  the  country  and  sector  level.  The  TA's  outcome  will  be  identified \ngovernance, capacity development, and anticorruption priorities addressed by DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Assessments of governance risks and capacity development will provide DMCs with \nmore focused diagnostics for prioritizing governance reforms and capacity development actions. \nIn responding to the assessments, the risk management plans and capacity development action \nplans  will  provide  practical,  actionable  measures  to  address  major  risks  that  have  been \nidentified. Good practice guidance for governance and capacity development will improve the \nquality  of  diagnostics,  enabling  DMCs  to  identify  the  actions  to  be  taken  to  strengthen \ngovernance capacity. By bringing together developed, middle-income, and weakly performing \ncountries\u2014supported by an advisory group comprising development partners, civil society, and \nthe private sector\u2014the ADB/OECD Initiative supports regional anticorruption efforts, fosters \nlearning, and generates regional and country knowledge. The knowledge generated through the \ninitiative not only supports DMC-led governance and anticorruption reforms, but also serves as \nan input to governance risk assessments. \n \n10.  Output  1:  Governance  Risk  Assessments  and  Risk  Management  Plans  Inform \nCPSs.  The TA will provide funds and technical support for preparation of governance risk \nassessments  for  selected  CPSs.  To  support  efforts  to  strengthen  quality  at  entry,  more \nemphasis will be placed on (i) the quality of risk management plans included in the CPS, and (ii) \nstrengthening the integration of risk management plans and sector road maps. \n \n11.  Output 2: Sector Capacity Development Assessments and Actions Plans Inform \nCPSs. The TA will provide funds and technical support for preparation of capacity development \nassessments focusing on risk mitigation measures identified in the governance risk assessment. \nThe  capacity  development  assessments  are expected  to  help  define  the scope  of  actions \nrequired to address major risks in the CPS governance risk management plans, improving the \nquality at entry of CPSs. \n12.  Output  3:  CDDE  Program  Supports  Government-Led  Capacity  Development \nInitiatives Across Asia and the Pacific. The TA will provide funds for the multidonor CDDE \nprogram designed to meet DMC government-led capacity development priorities to implement \npractical capacity development actions to further the Accra Agenda for Action.15 The CDDE \nprogram is organized around three key result areas: (i) signatories from Asia and the Pacific will \nachieve the Paris Declaration targets by 2010 and the Accra Agenda actions by the time of the \nfourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in 2011, (ii) Asian and Pacific countries will \nestablish  networks  with  each  other  that  will  improve  national  capacities  for  development \neffectiveness,  and  (iii)  Asian  and  Pacific  countries  will  contribute  to  the  institutional \nstrengthening of the global aid architecture. These will be achieved by supporting activities in \nthree  service  lines:  (i)  peer-to-peer  exchange,  (ii)  knowledge  management  and  help  desk \nservices, and (iii) an assessment of capacity development needs and strategies to meet them. \n                                                 \n15  This TA will provide funds for the CDDE first year's workplan. Subject to the results of the annual review, further \nfunding will be sought for the CDDE workplan for the second and third years. \n ", "4   \n \n13.  Output  4:  Good  Practice  Guides  Governance  and  Capacity  Development \nInitiatives. Building on the Guidelines for Implementing GACAP II, the TA will support the \npreparation of further guidance for ADB staff on sector-level governance risk and capacity \ndevelopment assessments and action plans. The first set of notes will focus on ADB\u2019s priority \nsectors, as defined in the long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020).16 The \nnotes will be informed by applied research on country and sector risk-based approaches to \nassessing public financial management, procurement, and combating corruption.17  \n \n14.  Output 5: Implementation of the ADB/OECD Anticorruption Action Plan for Asia \nand the Pacific Strengthened. The ADB/OECD Initiative's strategy and work plan for 2009\u2013\n2010  builds  on  the  successful  approach  taken  since  1999.  The  strategy  articulates  the \ninitiative\u2019s vision, role, and goals for 2009\u20132010. It takes into account recent changes in the \nanticorruption  landscape  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region  to  provide  member  countries  with \ntargeted  assistance  in  their  fight  against  corruption.  Key  elements  of  the  strategy  are  (i) \nensuring continual review of the progress of reform under the action plan, (ii) strengthening and \nexpanding  partnerships  in  the  fight  against  corruption,  and  (iii)  developing  capacity  for \nanticorruption activities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The cost of the TA, estimated at the equivalent of $2.05 million, will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program (TASF-IV) (equivalent to $1.55 \nmillion)  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  ($500,000), \nsupporting output 2. ADB will administer the e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund grant. The \nTA proceeds will cover consulting services, training, seminars, conferences, surveys and other \nstudies, and reports and publications. Indicative cost estimates and the financial plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency and will implement the TA. The Public Management, \nGovernance  and  Participation  division  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment, in collaboration with regional departments, will be responsible for TA activities for \noutputs 1, 2, and 4.  \n \n17.  Activities under output 3 will be managed by the UNDP Regional Center in Bangkok, \nwhich  is  the  CDDE  program  secretariat,  and  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  Some \ndevelopment partners have committed to financing the CDDE program.18 It is proposed that, \nthrough this TA, ADB will provide $150,000 to the joint development partners' fund that UNDP \nwill manage. An administrative arrangement between ADB and UNDP will be signed as set out \nin the memorandum of understanding between them,19 including an agreement that the CDDE \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2008.

The Australian Agency for \nInternational Development has expressed interest in the program. \n19 On 23 July 2007, ADB and UNDP signed a memorandum of understanding that covers cofinancing and other \narrangements for funding regional, subregional, and country programs and projects. A side letter covering the \nimplementation arrangements for this TA project will be signed with UNDP after Board approval. \n ", "  5\nprogram funds will be subject to the internal and external audit procedures provided in UNDP's \nfinancial regulations, rules, and directives. ADB will be a member of the program steering \ncommittee which will receive progress reports every 6 months.20 The CDDE program supports \nDMCs in Asia and the Pacific, and the contributions of all participants are made jointly. However, \na limited number of activities might occur in, or a consultant might be from, a non-ADB member \ncountry. Accordingly, it is recommended in para. 21(ii) that the ADB Board of Directors approve \nan exception to the procurement restrictions provided under Article 14 (ix) of the Charter for the \nCDDE program. \n \n18.  The  activities  under  output  5  represent  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  support  for  the  ADB/OECD \nInitiative. As in the past, ADB and OECD will have separate secretariat functions, and the TA \nwill be implemented jointly under the guidance of the initiative\u2019s steering group.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, starting in May 2009. The TA will require \ninternational consultants (estimated 27 person-months) and national consultants (estimated 129 \nperson-months)  with  expertise  in  governance,  public  financial  management,  procurement, \nanticorruption  practices,  and  capacity  development  at  country  and  sector  levels.  Terms  of \nreference for consultants will be further specified when specific governance risk assessment \nand  capacity  assessment  diagnostics  are  identified  by  regional  departments  for  CPS \npreparation. Copy editors (30 person days) will also provide support. \n \n20.  Given the intermittence of the assignments and the variety of skills required, consultants \nwill be recruited individually. Where appropriate, nongovernment organizations will be recruited. \nThe consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements will be made in accordance \nthe  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook.21 All  TA-financed  goods  will  be \nprocured in line with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n21.  The President recommends that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the provision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,050,000 \non a grant basis for the Governance and Capacity Development Initiative (Phase \n2). If the Board approves ADB providing technical assistance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $1,550,000, the President, acting under the authority delegated by \nthe  Board,  will  approve  ADB  administering  the  balance  of  the  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for the \nGovernance and Capacity Development Initiative (Phase 2).  \n(ii)  to facilitate ADB cooperation with other development partners in support of the \nCDDE program regarding (a) the selection and recruitment of consultants for the \nAsia-Pacific CDDE program referred to in paragraph 17 herein, in accordance \nwith the rules and procedures of UNDP; and (b) the procurement of consulting \nservices for the CDDE program in ADB member and nonmember countries, \nprovided Directors representing not less than two-thirds of the total voting power \nof the ADB members agree; to facilitate ADB cooperation with other development \npartners in support of the CDDE program implementation. \n                                                 \n20 The program steering committee will be comprised of representatives from two other development partners, one \nlegislature, three governments, and two civil society organizations. \n21 ADB. 2008.
