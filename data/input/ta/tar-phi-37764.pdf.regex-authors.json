The  Philippine  Government  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nprovide support for the promotion of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), in conjunction with \nthe implementation of the SME Development Plan 2004\u20142010. The Government considers \ndevelopment of SMEs as central to employment and income generation and further promotion \nof a sound and broad-based private sector. ADB\u2019s involvement in SME sector policy dialogue \nhas been extensive since 1999 which has facilitated the design of the Philippine Small and \nMedium-Sized  Enterprise  Development  Support  Project,  currently  under  processing.  This \ntechnical assistance (TA) is integral to the strengthening of risk management in SME finance \nand the promotion of product innovation by SME financial service providers.  This TA has been \ndesigned with the full cooperation and participation of the Department of Trade and Industry \n(DTI) and the Small Business Guarantee and Finance Corporation (SB Corp). 1  Agreement has \nbeen reached on the objectives, scope, cost estimates and financing and implementation \narrangments,  and  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  under  the  TA.    The  project \nframework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  SMEs represent a vital subsector of the Philippine economy. In 2002, SMEs contributed \n32% of value added, and accounted for 8% of business establishments2 and 31% of total \nemployment. Shares of value added and sales by SMEs have been increasing to 30% and 31%, \nrespectively, in 1998, from 21% and 22% in 1983, and both from  28%, in 1993. The SME \nsector\u2019s direct contribution to manufacturing exports was approximately 24%, but their indirect \ncontribution as suppliers to large exporters is likely much higher.  \n \n3.  Small  enterprises  are  defined  as  those  with  assets  valued  from  P3,000,001  to \nP15,000,000, while medium enterprises have assets from P15,000,001 to P100,000,000. Using \nan alternative definition based on number of employees, a small enterprise is one that employs \n10 to 99 people, while a medium enterprise employs 100\u2014199 people.3 SMEs are found in \npractically all subsectors, though more than 78% are concentrated within a range of traditional \nproduct groups: food processing, garments, gifts/toys/handicrafts, metal working, footwear and \nleather  goods,  wood  and  bamboo  products,  and  building  materials.  There  is  a  high \nconcentration  in  the  National  Capital  Region,  which  accounts  for  more  than  24%  of  all \nestablishments and 40% of all employees.  \n \n4.  The importance of SMEs to the Philippine economy is reflected in the so-called Magna \nCarta for SMEs, or Republic Act 6977 (RA) enacted in 1991.4 The RA lays out broad policy \ngoals related to the SME sector, which include improvement in productivity, upgrading of \nexisting\u2014and introduction of new\u2014technologies, lower costs of doing business, and better \naccess to financing. The RA also launched three major initiatives. First, the SME Development \nCouncil was created as the primary body for development of the country\u2019s SME sector through \npolicy  formulation,  interdepartmental  coordination,  and  promotion  of  programs  for  SME \ndevelopment. Second, the Magna Carta specified mandatory credit allocations for all banks to \nSMEs, 6% and 2% of lending to SMEs, respectively. Third, the government-owned financial \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 17 December 2003. \n2  There were 825,000 registered businesses in the Philippines in 2001, of which 62,000 are considered small and \n2,900 medium.  Of the remaining 92% of registered businesses, practically all are microenterprises. \n3  SME Development Council Resolution 1, 16 January 2003, and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Circular 376, 20 March \n2003. \n4  RA 6977 was enacted in 1991 and amended in 1997 by RA 8289. \n ", "2  \ninstitution (GFI), SB Corp, was created to provide SME finance nationwide at better terms than \nbanks could offer, i.e., by offering loans in smaller amounts, often with longer maturities, and \nbased on more flexible collateral requirements.  \n \n5.   In July 2004, President Arroyo announced a 10-point agenda of reforms for her 6-year \nterm. The first item is the creation of at least 6 million jobs in 6 years through supporting SME \ndevelopment by tripling of credit available to SMEs, developing land for agricultural business, \nand stimulating entrepreneurship. The Government also presented the SME Development Plan \n2004\u20142010,  a  comprehensive  sector  development  plan  to  be  implemented  by  concerned \nGovernment agencies in partnership with the private sector and external funding agencies. The \nSME plan is the result of numerous inputs from DTI, SME Development Council, and industry \nassociations in the Philippines as well as external agency-funded studies and TA.5 With the \nimplementation of this plan the Government projects that SMEs\u2019 gross value added will increase \nto 48% of the total, and that SME exports will grow by 16% annually.  \n \n6.  While the Philippine financial sector weathered the Asian financial crisis comparatively \nwell, SMEs suffered significant adverse effects in terms of availability of and access to finance. \nDespite  relatively  high  levels  of  liquidity,  rising  levels  of  non-performing  loans  and  a \ndeteriorating business environment have led to a reduction in lending by Philippine banks. \nDomestic credit to the private sector as a share of gross domestic product decreased from 62% \nin 1997 to 34% in 2003. Of total bank lending in 2003, 10.8% was channeled to the SME sector, \na decline from 13% in 2002.6 SME lending has accounted for at least 11.8% of annual gross \nlending since 1998. In 2003, loans to small and to medium enterprises accounted for 5.6% and \n5.2% of gross loans, respectively. This is lower than in comparable countries in the region such \nas Indonesia, where lending to small enterprise (with 5 to 20 employees ) was 17% of gross \nloans in both 2002 and 2003. Alternative formal sources of funding are limited for SMEs. The \nequity and bond markets are small in relation to the economy7 and SMEs cannot meet the \nrequirements for tapping these markets. Venture capital and lease financing are also limited. \nSmall enterprises in particular tend to rely more on informal sources of finance, which can be \nmore costly and far less stable than a bank credit line, regarding interest and repayment terms. \n \n7.  In response to the dramatic reduction in credit available to SMEs, the Government, in \n1999, authorized two GFIs, SB Corp and Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the \nPhilippines  (PhilEXIM),  to  lend  directly  (retail)  to  SMEs.  Until  then,  SB  Corp  had  offered \nguarantees and loans to SMEs on a wholesale basis via accredited financial institutions. SB \nCorp\u2019s current mandate is to support viable SMEs that cannot access bank finance due to \nbanks\u2019 stringent requirements, including those for collateral. Using its own offices as well as the \nDTI\u2019s regional offices and bureaus to disseminate information on both its retail and wholesale \nlending operations and guarantee programs, SB Corp aims to reach SMEs nationwide. \n \n8.  SB Corp has become a major innovator in the field of SME finance. It plays mainly a \ncatalytic role by promoting SME lending through wholesale operations with commercial and thrift \nbanks, on the one hand, while also experimenting with retail lending, on the other. SB Corp is \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1999. Strengthening Export Competitiveness. Manila (TA 3345 for $1 million); and ADB. 2002. Program to \nAccelerate Small and Medium Enterprise Financing. Manila (TA 4070 for $400,000).  The Japan International \nCooperation Agency provided advisory TA to draft the SME Development Plan. \n6  The upward adjustment of the asset-size ceiling of medium enterprises in 2001 from P60 million to P100 million \nmade it easier for the commercial banks to directly comply with SME credit allocation.  \n7  The total market capitalization of the Philippine Stock Exchange was 23.6% of GDP in 2003. \n ", "  3\nwell capitalized and profitable. Its nonperforming loans,8 at present amount to slightly more than \n10% of its overall portfolio, a level that is substantially below the average for commercial banks. \nSB Corp has an opportunity, if it can both substantially increase its lending activities and \nimprove the efficiency of its operations, to provide a powerful demonstration to the market about \nthe profitability of SME lending. Most of the clients served through both its wholesale and retail \noperations represent smaller, but still viable SMEs that cannot otherwise access commercial \nsources of funding due to the combination of the failure  of commercial banks to serve the \nmarket, and the difficulty in providing sufficient collateral that may be legally pledged. \n \n9.  SB Corp is a pioneer in using nontraditional collateral as security for SME loans, \naccepting as collateral a broader range of assets and at higher values than do banks. Collateral \nis taken as a sign of seriousness by both borrower and lender, mirroring standard microlending \nunderwriting techniques.  Legal enforcement is not an option, and the collateral must be \nsurrendered voluntarily.  Philippine banks rarely accept as collateral anything other than titled \nprime real estate. Collateral, therefore, is a key constraint to greater access by SMEs to bank \nfinancing. It is necessary to create a solid legal foundation under nontraditional collateral so that \ncommercial banks, seeing a demonstrable profit opportunity, will serve the SME market on a \nsecured basis.  Nontraditional collateral essentially means movable property. At present, there \nis no way to perfect legally a security interest in movable property, and there is no movable \ncollateral registry. This represents a significant legal gap in the secured transactions framework, \nand one that impacts SMEs disproportionately. \n \n10.  SB Corp\u2019s management has discovered (as have many other lenders in many places) \nthat there is no clear correlation between the kind and quality of collateral offered to a lender \nand loan default.  That means that loan underwriting techniques that do not rely on traditional \ncollateral are highly relevant in the Philippines context. Micro and small enterprise (MSE) \nlending  based  upon  evaluations  of  borrower  character  and  capacity  is  an  example  of  a \nsuccessful \u201cnontraditional\u201d lending technique, though often, microfinance institutions (MFIs) do \nrequire MSE borrowers to provide collateral, despite the fact that the legal basis for securing or \nseizing collateral may be weak. Experiments in other countries have shown that MSE lending \ntechniques, appropriately modified, can be applied prudently in small business lending as well. \n \n11.  In general, SMEs find it difficult to submit proper (let alone) audited financial statements, \nor to prepare business plans with sales and revenue projections that meet banks\u2019 requirements. \nNewer SMEs tend to rely on own funds, relatives, or expensive informal finance providers due \nto the difficulties of accessing formal finance.  DTI has recognized this situation and offers \ncounseling and some assistance through its SME Centers.  In addition, a number of donors, \nincluding  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  fur  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (German  Agency  for \nTechnical Cooperation),  and the  Canadian International Development Agency are active in \nproviding business development services to SMEs throughout the country.  On the financing \nside,  both  Kreditanstalt  fur  Wiederaufbau  and  the  International  Fund  for  Agriculture  and \nDevelopment are considering lending to SB Corp.   \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  Actual nonperforming loans, as of year-end 2003, amounted to 10.3% of total wholesale and retail lending. SB \nCorp\u2019s allowances for loan losses are presently 202% of these nonperforming loans, meaning there is more than \nadequate coverage of the potential losses from SB Corp\u2019s lending activities.   \n ", "4  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The goal of the TA is to promote financial deepening by expanding SMEs\u2019 access to \ncredit. The purpose is to expand and improve the quality of lending operations of SB Corp, while \nlowering risk, and mainstreaming market acceptance of nontraditional collateral.  Outputs will \ninclude:  \n \n(i)  Enhanced management information system (MIS) and analysis of lending \noperations at SB Corp, based on line of business reporting; \n(ii)  Updated/redesigned SME loan products incorporating cash flow, character, and \nnontraditional collateral into underwriting; \n(iii)  Credit scoring model for SB Corp\u2019s retail lending; and \n(iv)  Blueprint for movables collateral registry. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA aims to expand SB Corp\u2019s outreach and improve its financial performance, \nproviding a powerful demonstration effect in the loan market, while at the same time expanding \nthe scope for secured transactions in such a way that more SMEs can access commercial \nsources of credit. The outputs will be achieved through the provision of consulting services, \nfocused on activities in two key areas.  \n \n1.  Institutional Capacity Building at Small Business Guarantee and Finance \nCorporation  \n \n14.  The TA will provide international expertise to SB Corp managers and staff in support of \nbuilding efficient, profitable lending businesses that can achieve substantial outreach. SB Corp \nneeds to strengthen its capacity to evaluate the profitability, credit risk, costs, and efficiency of \nboth its wholesale and retail lending operations. The first key output of the TA will be the \nenhanced capacity to analyze costs, profitability, and credit risk in each of its two main lines of \nbusiness. MIS will be improved as part of this process, utilizing its Oracle-based system recently \nput into place.  \n \n15.  The second priority is to examine the retail loan underwriting process. SB Corp currently \nhas a more flexible approach to securing its loans, and accepts a broader range of collateral, \nthan  do  Philippine  commercial  banks.  The  TA  will  provide  a  specialist  in  loan  product \ndevelopment to work with SB Corp management to ensure that appropriate non-asset-based \nlending  methodologies  are  incorporated  into  their  underwriting  process.  To  the  extent \npracticable, those underwriting techniques should allow pledged items that could be secured via \na registry of movable property to be  accepted as collateral. The objective in this effort is to \nminimize paperwork, processing times, and transaction costs, and to expand lending volumes.  \n \n16.  Third, the TA will assist SB Corp to develop a proprietary credit scoring model that will \nincorporate SB Corp\u2019s own underwriting standards, and draw upon lessons learned from its own \nlending experience. A credit scoring model is a powerful way in which financial institutions can \nstreamline the processing of loans, and thereby increase the volume of their business. It is also \nthe purpose of the credit scoring model to select out borrowers with poor risk profiles by \nevaluating key factors impacting payment performance. SB Corp\u2019s database of retail customers \n ", "  5\nprovides an appropriate starting point for identifying key factors affecting credit quality, and this \ndirect customer experience is necessary to incorporate into a credit scoring model that fits SB \nCorp. As a result of these two activities, reviewing underwriting policies and procedures and \ndeveloping a credit scoring model, loan products may be streamlined or redesigned so as to be \nbetter tailored to SB Corp\u2019s clients, and be more profitable as well.  \n \n2.  Enhancing Legal Environment for Secured Transactions \n \n17.  The  TA  will  create  the  blueprint  for  a  movable  collateral  registry.  The  blueprint \nencompasses a review of existing laws and recommendations related to potential amendments \nand/or new legislation that might be required to expand the framework for secured transactions \nto encompass movable property. In addition, it will be necessary to outline a strategy for \nbringing the collateral registry into being, which will involve identifying and working with the key \nstakeholders, from both the public and private sectors, who will oversee the creation of the \nregistry, maintain it, and use it. The output will be a time-bound action plan for creating the \nmovable collateral registry. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The estimated cost of the TA is $718,500, comprising $410,000 in foreign exchange and \n$308,500  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide \n$500,000 equvalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $90,000 in local currency \ncosts. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment  of  Japan.  The  Philippine  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $218,500 \nequivalent  in  kind  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff,  transportation \nexpenses, and training. Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  DTI will be the Executing Agency for the TA. SB Corp will be the implementing agency \nfor activities related to its own institutional capacity building. Individual consultants will be \nrecruited  by  ADB in accordance with its  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  TA \nconsultants working at SB Corp will report directly to the implementing agency project manager \ndesignated for the specific consulting assignment, as well as to the ADB project officer. \n \n20.  Three international consultants will serve for a total of 14 person-months. They will \ninclude a bank financial management expert (2 person-months), a loan product development \nspecialist (4 person-months), and a credit scoring expert (8 person-months). One domestic \nconsultant, a secured transaction legal expert, will serve for 10 months. Appendix 3 presents the \noutline terms of reference for the consultants.  The TA is expected to begin in March 2005 and \nto be completed by February 2006. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for Strengthening SME Credit Management Systems, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators and    and Risks \nTargets   \n \nGoal       \n\u2022  Promote financial  \u2022  Increased lending  \u2022  SB Corp reports   \ndeepening by  to SMEs, in terms   \nexpanding SMEs\u2019  of both overall  \u2022  BSP reports \naccess to credit   volume of loans,   \n  and numbers of   \nSMEs serviced. \nKey indicators: \n \n\u2022  250% increase in \nnumbers of SMEs \nreceiving loans \nthrough combined \nwholesale and \nretail operations of \nSB Corp by year \nend 2009.  \n \nPurpose      Assumptions \n\u2022  Expand lending  \u2022  Performance and  \u2022  SB Corp reports  \u2022  SB maintains focus on \noperations of SB  output indicators to  SME lending \nCorp, while lowering  include:  \u2022  Continued high demand \nrisk, and  \u2022  ROA of no less  for credit by SMEs who \nmainstreaming  than 2.5% for SB  do not have traditional \nmarket acceptance  Corp overall, and  collateral to offer \nof nontraditional  also for individual   \ncollateral   retail and  Risk \n  wholesale lines of  \u2022  Major financial crisis \nbusiness from FY  impacts demand for \n2005 through 2009;
