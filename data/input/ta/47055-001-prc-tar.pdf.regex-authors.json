During the country programming mission in December 2012, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested capacity development technical assistance (TA) \nfor Strengthening Capacity for Low-Carbon Development in Ningbo. The concept paper was \napproved on 19 April 2013.1 \n \n2.  During the TA fact-finding mission, the impact and outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference \nwere agreed with the Ningbo municipal government (NMG) and the Ministry of Finance. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Energy  intensity  reduction  has  been  a  major  government  initiative  to  address \nenvironmental and climate change impacts from a rapidly growing economy dependent on fossil \nfuels.2 During the 11th Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010, the initiative achieved a reduction of 19.2% \nin energy intensity. The 12th Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 mandates a further 16% reduction in \nenergy  intensity.  The  government  has  initiated  financial  and  policy  incentives  to  stimulate \ninvestments to improve energy efficiency.  \n \n4.  The 12th plan target for reducing energy intensity requires a more strategic approach to \n(i) transform industrial structure from energy-intensive primary industries such as iron and steel \nto high-tech industries with higher value addition and a smaller carbon footprint, and (ii) expand \nthe services sector share of the economy. In addition, the energy supply mix needs to be \ntransformed from carbon-intensive coal to renewable energy and low-carbon fossil fuels such as \nnatural gas.  \n \n5.  Ningbo is a city in Zhejiang Province with a population of 7.5 million. It is one of the \nmajor coastal cities in the PRC, featuring high-tech manufacturing industries and a relatively \nmature and sophisticated finance sector. Manufacturing is dominated by petrochemicals and \nhigh-tech  products  such  as  precision  machinery,  automobiles,  and  information  technology \nequipment. Yet Ningbo retains many traditional industries, some of which still use obsolete and \ninefficient technologies. Limited access to debt financing, inadequate policies and regulations, \nand weak capacity constrain investment in more efficient technologies, especially constraining \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).3   \n \n6.  To enhance its efforts favoring low-carbon development, the NMG recently established \nthe Office of Climate Change Mitigation under the Ningbo Municipal Development and Reform \nCommission and started in 2012 to formulate its low-carbon development action plan (LCDAP). \nThe LCDAP emphasizes improving industrial energy efficiency and expanding the share of \nrenewable energy and natural gas. The NMG is keen to introduce market-based instruments to \npromote private sector investments to improve industrial energy efficiency under the LCDAP.  \n \n7.  Efforts to improve energy efficiency in Ningbo have so far been driven primarily by \nadministrative measures targeting large enterprises, or those that consume more than 100,000 \ntons of coal equivalent per year. Under the 12th plan, the NMG has widened the scope by \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 May 2013. \n2  Energy intensity is the amount of energy used per unit of gross domestic product. \n3  SMEs in the PRC have a turnover of less than CNY400 million and fewer than 1,000 employees.   \n ", "2  \ntargeting  enterprises  that  consume  more  than  3,000  tons  of  coal  equivalent  per  year.4 \nCombined with concerted efforts to promote energy conservation in commercial and residential \nbuildings, in public facilities, and in the provision of urban services such as heating and water \nsupply, this lower threshold has brought renewed focus on energy efficiency improvement in \nSMEs.  \n \n8.  Ningbo is endowed with excellent renewable energy resources that can help meet local \nenergy  needs  and  decarbonize  energy  supply.  Solar  energy  technologies  can  contribute \nsignificantly to meeting the electricity and heat requirements of residential and public buildings. \nHeat and power plants fueled by biomass and municipal solid waste can provide electricity and \nheat  in  large  urban  areas.  Heat  pumps  to  extract  shallow-ground  geothermal  energy  can \nreplace coal boilers in urban heating supply systems, thus decarbonizing heat supply. \n \n9.  The TA supports the PRC\u2019s 12th plan objectives of further reducing energy intensity. It is \nconsistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nthe  PRC,  which  emphasizes  environmentally  sustainable growth,  public\u2013private  partnership \n(PPP), and SME development in low-carbon economic sectors.5 It complements and advances \nADB\u2019s previous interventions and efforts to improve industrial energy efficiency through loans6 \nand nonlending projects,7 as well as by establishing emissions-trading markets in Tianjin and \nShanghai.8 It will help the NMG identify actions and policies to be initiated under its LCDAP to \naccelerate the improvement of industrial energy efficiency and the shift to renewable energy. \nThe TA aligns with the priorities of the Ministry of Finance and National Development and \nReform Commission to develop innovative financing mechanisms to further stimulate energy \nefficiency and renewable and clean energy investments through market-based mechanisms. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be reduced carbon emissions and energy consumption in Ningbo. The \noutcome  will  be  market-based  LCDAP  attractive  to  the  private  sector  is  developed  and \nlaunched. \n \n                                                \n4  The threshold stipulated by the central government under 12th plan for targeting energy consuming enterprises is \n10,000 tons of coal equivalent per year.  \n5  ADB. 2012.

The TA will address the NMG\u2019s critical gaps in capacity to design and implement a low-\ncarbon development strategy through a package of policy, regulations, and financial incentives \nto promote industrial energy efficiency and accelerate a shift to electricity generation using \ndistributed renewable energy resources. The TA will enhance the NMG\u2019s capacity to structure \nPPPs for clean energy investments, appropriately allocating responsibilities and risks between \nprivate and public entities.  \n \n12.  The TA will identify technologies and industrial processes to achieve benchmark energy \nefficiency  levels  and  help  the  NMG  establish  a  technology-transfer  mechanism  through \ntechnology providers such as energy service companies (ESCOs). As ESCOs have technical \nexpertise in appropriate technologies but are constrained by lack of access to debt financing, \nthe  TA  will  develop  innovative  financial  products9 and  instruments  and  recommend  the \nestablishment of a dedicated financing platform to overcome prevailing barriers and mobilize \nfinancing for energy efficiency projects implemented by ESCOs and SMEs. If successful, it can \nbe replicated in other parts of the PRC.   \n \n13.  The integration of distributed renewable energy sources poses a number of technical, \ninstitutional, and financial challenges, as investments must flow to a scattered multitude of small \nrenewable energy projects, rather than to a single large project. The role of private investments \nin such projects cannot be emphasized enough. The TA will review the current policy framework \nto  introduce  appropriate  policy  incentives  through  a  transparent  regulatory  regime,  feed-in \ntariffs, and tax incentives to promote private sector investments through PPPs in distributed \nrenewable energy.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, secretarial \nassistance, and other in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimate and the financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  Ningbo  Municipal  Development  and  Reform  Commission  will  be  the  executing \nagency. The Office of Climate Change Mitigation will be the implementing agency and ensure \nthat  the  policies  and  strategies  related  to  Ningbo\u2019s  LCDAP  are  communicated  to  the \nconsultants. The consultants will work with counterpart staff to ensure effective knowledge \ntransfer and information flow between the consultants and the executing and implementing \nagencies. Periodic tripartite meetings of ADB, the executing and implementing agencies, and \nconsultants will guide the consultants and review their reports. Workshops and seminars will \ncollect comments and discuss consultants\u2019 reports.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. Phase 1 will help the NMG identify strategies, \ninitiatives, and financial products that need to be launched as early actions under the LCDAP. \n                                                \n9  These may include guarantees specifically designed for ESCO transactions, dedicated credit lines that accept \nreceivables  under  energy  performance  contracts  as  collateral,  the  buying  back  and  securitization  of  cash \nreceivables under energy performance contracts, and direct equity investments. \n ", "4  \nPhase 2 will support (i) policy formulation and the design of institutional arrangements to deliver \nthe financial products identified under phase 1, and (ii) the preparation of PPP transactions in \nclean energy and capacity strengthening in government agencies, financial institutions, and \npotential investors toward encouraging private investments in clean energy.  \n \n17.  Due to the urgency of finalizing the Ningbo LCDAP, Phase 1 will be implemented by a \nteam  of  individual  consultants  to  be  recruited  by  ADB  and  consisting  of  two  international \nconsultants  contracted  for  a  total  of  6  person-months  and  four  national  consultants,  also \ncontracted for 6 person-months. For phase 2, ADB will engage a consulting firm to supply two \ninternational consultants for a total of 5 person-months and five national consultants for 13 \nperson-months. The TA will be implemented over 18 months, with phase 1 undertaken from 1 \nJuly to 31 December 2013 and phase 2 from 1 January to 31 December 2014. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants and the reporting requirements are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  The  consultants  recruited  for  phases  1  and  2  will  have  extensive  knowledge  and \nexpertise regarding (i) energy efficiency project preparation and due diligence, (ii) distributed \nrenewable energy technologies and implementation models for distributed renewable energy \nprojects,  (iii)  how  to  structure  PPP  projects  for  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency \ninvestments, (iv) financial regulations governing SME financing in the PRC, and (v) structuring \nfinancial products to overcome the barriers faced by ESCOs.  \n \n19.  The consulting firm for phase 2 will be engaged using quality- and cost-based selection \nwith  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10,  as  the  experience  and  expertise  of  the  consultants  in \ndesigning innovative financial products is highly relevant to achieving TA objectives. Selection \nwill be based on a simplified technical proposal. Consultant recruitment will accord with ADB \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). TA funds will be \ndisbursed in line with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n \n20.  Activities for capacity development and information dissemination, such as seminars, \nworkshops,  conferences,  and  study  tours,  will  be  finalized  during  TA  implementation  and \nadministered  by  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The  consultants  will  prepare \ncapacity  building  materials  and  facilitate  knowledge  transfer  on  key  aspects  of  the  TA  to \nstakeholders in Ningbo as well as to relevant central government officials.  \n \n21.  The  phase  1  consultants  will  submit  an  inception  report  within  2  weeks  of \ncommencement, an interim report after 2 months, and a draft final report after 4 months. The \nfinal report of phase 1 will be submitted 2 weeks after receiving ADB comments. The phase 2 \nconsultants will submit (i) an inception report within 1 month after signing the consulting contract, \n(ii) a midterm report 6 months after the commencement of consulting services, (iii) a draft final \nreport 1 month before TA completion, and (iv) a final report within 1 month after receiving \nfeedback from the executing and implementing agencies and ADB on the draft final report. \n \n22.  All  TA  deliverables  and  progress  reports  will  be  written  in  English.  The  national \nconsultants will be responsible for translating documents into Chinese. Three copies of each TA \ndeliverable will be submitted to ADB in English, and 10 copies (2 in English and 8 in Chinese) \nwill be submitted to the executing and implementing agencies. The deliverables and progress \nreports should address the terms of reference with details appropriate to that stage of the TA.  \n \n ", "  5 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.
