INTRODUCTION \n1.  The focus of the capacity development technical assistance (TA) is consistent with the \naims of the Government of Fiji\u2019s public sector reform program and ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach \n2010\u20132014, which accords priority to improved public sector management in the region.1 A TA \nfact-finding mission visited Fiji from 1\u20138 September 2011 and reached an understanding with \nthe  government  and  other  stakeholders  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2    \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  For more than a decade, Fiji has experienced low rates of economic growth, negligible \njob creation, and consistently high levels of poverty. The poverty incidence was estimated at \n35.2% of the population in 2009, far above Fiji\u2019s Millennium Development Goal target of 14.7% \nby 2015.3 Moreover, nearly half of the population could be considered to be poor or near poor, if \nthose with incomes near the poverty line are included. Poverty reduction challenges include \nhigh dropout rates in basic education; low participation rates in postsecondary education; a \nlifestyle-induced rise in noncommunicable diseases; the lack of access to clean drinking water \nand modern sanitation facilities by a large segment of the population; the growing numbers of \nfamilies that reside in urban squatter settlements; and the low levels of expenditure on, and poor \ncoverage of, social safety net programs. Per capita incomes in Fiji have declined steadily from \n2001 to 2011. Economic growth, has averaged \u20130.3% per annum since 2006, which is far below \nwhat is needed to meet Fiji\u2019s poverty reduction targets. \n \n3.  Fiji\u2019s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are a major impediment to both economic growth \nand poverty reduction. The SOEs absorb scarce government funding, use capital inefficiently, \nraise costs, and impede effective delivery of basic infrastructure services. Low productivity of \nSOE investment is a significant hindrance to economic growth. \n \n4.  SOEs make up a significant proportion of Fiji\u2019s economy\u2014there are 29 SOEs with \ncombined assets of $845 million dollars (22% of gross domestic product); two of these are in \nliquidation.4 The government\u2019s SOE portfolio represents close to 20% of Fiji\u2019s total economic \nassets. The average return on assets for SOEs in 2002\u20132009 was 0.4%, and the average return \non equity was 0.8%.5 In 2002\u20132009, SOEs generated profits of just $18.6 million, which was \nless than the $23.6 million the government injected into loss-making SOEs. Returns on private \ninvestment in 2008 were nearly seven times higher than returns on SOE investments.  \n \n5.  The government recognizes the urgent need for reform, and has launched a program of \nSOE divestment, corporatization, and outsourcing of SOE functions to the private sector. The \ngovernment has an explicit SOE reform strategy for 2010\u20132012, which is estimated to cost \n$13.6 million to implement. The following SOE reforms have been implemented: (i) the merger \nof Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries into Fiji Ports Corporation in 2009, (ii) corporatization of the \nWater  and  Sewage  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Utilities  into  a  commercial  statutory \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

Efforts are ongoing to divest the government\u2019s holdings in other SOEs, including the Fiji \nMeat Industry Board, Food Processors Fiji, and Post Fiji. \n \n6.  Nonetheless, implementation of the planned SOE reform agenda has been delayed by a \nseries of institutional and budgetary constraints. There is no detailed implementation plan for the \nSOE reform strategy to guide and sequence specific reforms. The government is unable to \nattract skilled persons for senior civil service positions, with the result that these positions are \nincreasingly  filled  with  personnel  that  lack  the  expertise  needed  to  design  and  oversee \ntechnically complex and contentious SOE reforms. The government\u2019s efforts to reform SOEs \nhave  also been  weakened  by  frequent  changes  in  senior  civil servant  positions.  Financial \nresources are limited, and several SOEs will require financial restructuring. There are high \nexpectations regarding implementation progress and associated near-term gains, despite the \nchallenges faced, and increasing recognition that target dates for completion must be pushed \nback.    \n \n7.  Acceleration of SOE reform can significantly contribute to growth and poverty reduction. \nBetter SOE service provision in areas such as power, water, and telecommunications can bring \nessential services to the poor and improve their livelihoods. Commercialization and privatization \nof  SOEs  will  boost  opportunities  for  private  sector  development.  SOE  reform  will  bolster \nproductivity  throughout  the  economy,  and  facilitate  growth  and  job  creation.  Better  SOE \nperformance is expected to reduce the need for government subsidies and budget transfers and \nallow redirection of savings to other priority areas for government expenditure.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be higher rates of economic growth and poverty reduction and improved \nprovision of services. TA performance will be monitored through achievement of fiscal and \nenterprise performance targets for SOE reform contained in the government\u2019s reform program. \nThe outcome will be strengthened SOE reform planning, management, and implementation \ncapacity  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises, \nCommunication, Civil Aviation, and Tourism (MPECCAT). The achievement of this outcome will \nbe reflected in reduced budgetary demands and declining levels of contingent liabilities from \nSOEs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will address a fundamental constraint to the effective implementation of SOE \nreforms,  i.e.,  the  lack  of  technical  capacity  among  key  public  sector  managers  in  central \nagencies of the government to design and manage SOE reforms. The TA will build on ADB\u2019s \nsignificant history of support for SOE reforms in Fiji to (i) support MOF and MPECCAT in \npreparing  a  coordinated  and  sequenced  SOE  reform  implementation  plan;  (ii) support  the \nimplementation  of  pilot  SOE  reforms;  and  (iii)  facilitate  an  effective  SOE  reform  steering \ncommittee. \n \n10.  Output 1: preparation of a coordinated and sequenced state-owned enterprise \nreform implementation plan. The government\u2019s SOE reform strategy will be reviewed by the \n ", "  3\nSOE reform steering committee (to be chaired by the permanent secretary for MPECCAT, and \ncomprising the permanent secretaries for MOF, Ministry of Strategic Development, National \nPlanning and Statistics, and Public Service Commission, and a representative from the Solicitor \nGeneral\u2019s Office). Staff of MOF and MPECCAT, supported by the TA, will serve as the steering \ncommittee\u2019s secretariat. Based on the review, the committee will identify policy and technical \ngaps,  constraints  to  implementation  and,  where  appropriate,  will  realign  and/or  reprioritize \nreform priorities. Reforms that have the best potential to bring about significant benefits to low-\nincome households in terms of job creation and/or more efficient provision of basic public \nservices will be prioritized and recommended for cabinet endorsement. Support will then be \nprovided for developing an implementation road map that will pilot actions from the strategy that \ncan be replicated across the various SOEs. The implementation road map will include policy \nframeworks  and  good  practice  guidelines  for  reorganization,  corporatization,  increased \ncommercialization, partial and full privatization, and outsourcing. \n \n11.  Output 2: Pilot state-owned enterprise reforms. One SOE will be selected as a pilot \nfor reform. It is expected that this SOE will be restructured and prepared for privatization. There \nare valuable lessons in restructuring and divestiture to be gained from this experience.     \n \n12.  Output  3:  An  effective  state-owned  enterprise  reform  steering  committee. \nInstitutional capacities for SOE reform will be developed. A needs assessment will identify \ncapacity development requirements. Based on the identified needs of MOF and MPECCAT \nstaff, a capacity development road map will be developed and implemented (primarily through \non-the-job training). This approach builds on lessons from previous ADB assistance to support \nSOE  reform  implementation  in  the  Pacific,  and  in  Fiji  in  particular,  which  points  to  the \nimportance of capacity building and development through on-the-job coaching, informal training \nsessions, workshops, and seminars. \n \n13.  SOE  reforms  can  be  contentious  and  will  require  strong  leadership  within  the \ngovernment.  Risks  to  implementation  include  (i)  changes  in  the  government\u2019s  SOE  policy \ndirection; (ii) external shocks, which could divert government\u2019s attention from SOE reform; (iii) \nlimited  government  capacity,  and  staff  changes; and  (iv)  stakeholder  resistance  to  reform. \nThese  risks  are  compounded  by  the  restrictions  on  public  consultation  and  open  debate \nestablished by the amended Public Order Act, 2012; both public consultation and open debate \nare essential to building broad ownership of SOE reforms. \n \n14.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  coordinated  oversight  of  the  TA  and  the \nimplementation of key tasks by the SOE reform steering committee; (ii) cabinet endorsement of \noutputs 1 and 2; (iii) close management of the TA by ADB at the field level; and (iv) an 18-month \nimplementation period to ensure that the appropriate building blocks for long-term capacity \nbuilding are put in place. Consultations with nongovernment stakeholders will be arranged and \nfacilitated by the steering committee in compliance with the amended Public Order Act. More \nimportantly, there is broad-based domestic support for SOE reforms. These reforms have long \nbeen a priority, as evidenced by (i) inclusion of specific policy measures in successive national \ndevelopment plans and national budgets; and (ii) the results of consultations with a wide range \nof public and private sector stakeholders prior to TA preparation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The government has requested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office \n ", "4  \naccommodation, office supplies, and secretarial assistance. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The executing agency will be MOF, and both MOF and MPECCAT will be implementing \nagencies. The government will form the SOE reform steering committee to coordinate TA \nactivities and track implementation progress. At present, ADB is the only development partner \nassisting  in  SOE  reform.  The  TA  consultants  will  liaise  with  relevant  development  partner \nprograms  and  projects  working  in  complementary  areas  to  ensure  a  coordinated  and \nharmonized approach to economic policy reform. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months (May 2012\u2013October 2013) and will provide \n17 person-months of international and 6 person-months of national consulting services. The \nconsultants will work as a cohesive team and comprise an SOE specialist and team leader \n(international,  8  person-months);  a  capacity  development  expert  (international,  3  person-\nmonths); a sector specialist (international, 6 person-months), and a local facilitation specialist \n(national, 6 person-months). \n \n18.  The consultants will be engaged through a firm based on a simplified technical proposal \nunder the quality- and cost-based selection process, using a 90:10 quality\u2013cost weighting in \nlight of the highly technical and complex nature of the activities. The consultants will be engaged \naccording to the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n19.  The team leader will produce a concise inception report outlining the work program and \nmilestones for the duration of the TA, and a final report summarizing the achievements, issues, \nlessons, and next steps. Throughout the TA, the team leader will submit brief monthly progress \nreports  summarizing  TA  activities,  progress,  issues,  and  constraints.  Team  members  will \nproduce reports on their respective activities for incorporation in the team leader's progress and \nfinal reports. The draft final report will be submitted at least 5 weeks prior to the end of the \nassignment, and finalized within 2 weeks of receipt of comments from the government and ADB. \n \n20.  TA progress will be monitored using performance targets described in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). ADB will assist the government in sharing all reports with \nother development partners. These will be disseminated through roundtable meetings, radio \ninterviews, and the ADB website.  \n \nIV.

Consultant services will support the technical assistance (TA). The team leader will be a \nstate-owned enterprise (SOE) specialist and will supervise all consultants and lead the work on \nthe TA. Consultants are expected to work together to ensure that TA is delivered in line with the \nintended scope and that subprojects are coherent. \n \n2.  The consultants will work as a cohesive team to deliver the tasks below. The TA will be \nimplemented by a team of three international consultants (total of 17 person-months) and one \nnational consultant (total of 6 person-months). The international consultant team will comprise \nan SOE specialist acting as team leader (8 person-months); a capacity development expert \n(3 person-months); and a sector specialist (6 person-months). These will be joined by a local \nfacilitation specialist (national, 6 person-months). \n \nA.  Team Leader and State-Owned Enterprise Reform Specialist (international, \n8 person-months, intermittent) \n3.  The specialist will have extensive experience in public sector reform across a range of \ntechnical  and  political settings.  The  specialist  must  have  (i) strong,  demonstrated  political, \nnegotiation,  and  process-facilitation  skills;  (ii)  a  demonstrated  ability  to  effect  change  in  a \nmanner that takes into account the social and political constraints of Pacific Island settings; and \n(iii)  a  practical  understanding  of  the  needed  consultative  and  participatory  processes.  The \nspecialist will undertake a joint secretariat role to the SOE reform steering committee chaired by \nthe permanent secretary for the Ministry of Public Enterprises, Communication, Civil Aviation \nand Tourism (MPECCAT). \n4.  Tasks will include but not be limited to the following: \n(i)  Review the government\u2019s current SOE reform program to ensure alignment with \nthe government\u2019s economic and political strategic focus and identify any potential \nsocial impacts. Update the reform program to ensure inclusion of (a) elements \nthat  address  reorganization,  corporatization,  increased  commercialization, \noutsourcing,  privatization,  rationalization,  and  regulation;  and  (b) \nrecommendations to strengthen the management and financial positions of SOEs \nthat  remain  under  government  ownership,  so  they  can  meet  the  principal \nobjective of SOEs as set out in the Public Enterprise Act, 1996. In undertaking \nthis task, the specialist should be cognizant of and guided by lessons from \nprevious  assistance  to  SOEs  in  Fiji,  the  broader  Pacific  context,  and  the \nprinciples of SOE reform set out in Schedule 1 of the Public Enterprise Act. For \nSOEs  in  which  privatization  is  considered  the  optimum  outcome,  develop  a \nprivatization pipeline. \n(ii)  Develop a detailed SOE reform implementation road map that will identify priority \nor first-order activities and outcomes of the strategy that can be used as pilot \nactivities and outcomes to build understanding and capacity within MPECCAT \nand the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to assist in full implementation of the strategy \nby  the  government.  Reforms  that  have  the  best  potential  to  bring  about \nsignificant benefits to low-income households in terms of job creation or more \nefficient  provision  of  basic  public  services  should  be  prioritized.  The \nimplementation  road  map  is  to  be  approved  by  the  SOE  reform  steering \ncommittee and endorsed by cabinet. \n ", "  Appendix 3  9 \n(iii)  Prepare  policy  frameworks  and  good  practice  guidelines  for  reorganization, \ncorporatization  and  increased  commercialization,  partial  and  full  privatization, \nand outsourcing. \n(iv)  Work  closely  with  the  capacity  development  expert  to  understand  capacity \nconstraints within MOF and MPECCAT that may impact upon the proposed TA \ninputs and propose a short-to-medium term approach for sustainable capacity \ndevelopment in SOE reform.
