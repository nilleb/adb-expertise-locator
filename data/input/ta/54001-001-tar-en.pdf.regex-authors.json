The proposed West Bengal Public Finance Management Reforms Program of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) seeks to keep improving operational efficiencies, resource planning \nand  management,  and  service  delivery  in  West  Bengal  by  taking  a  whole-of-government \napproach to public financial management (PFM). \n \n2.  The rationale of the program is to create fiscal space and improve public service delivery \nby  (i)  extending the  reforms  undertaken  under  earlier  programs to  other  departments  and \nparastatals;1 (ii) upgrading the integrated financial management system (IFMS) and linking it with \nthe financial management systems of other agencies, such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) \nand  West  Bengal's  Office  of  the  Principal  Accountant  General  (PAG);  (iii)  automating  the \nmanagement of projects and public works; (iv) improving the availability of information for more \neffective service delivery; and (iv) continuously building the PFM capacities of state government \nand parastatal employees.  \n \n3.  The effect of the reforms will be stronger operational efficiency of the Government of West \nBengal\u2019s PFM system, which will link the state Finance Department, parastatals, and external \nagencies (RBI and PAG). It will be achieved through the following reform areas: (i) automated \nand integrated systems for better management of social protection benefits, and grants to \nparastatals; (ii) improved resource planning, management, and control; and (iii) more effective \ninformation management and service delivery.2 \n \n4.  Based on the development financing requirements of the policy reform program, the \nGovernment of India requested a regular loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, \nan annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. There is no maturity premium \npayable to ADB. The central government will on-lend to the state government the local currency \ngenerated from the proceeds of the loan in accordance with its arrangement for the transfer of \nexternal assistance. Two tranches of $25 million each are envisaged: the first one disbursed upon \nloan effectiveness and the second one 24 months after the first tranche, or upon achievement of \nthe second-tranche policy actions agreed by the state government.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  The attached transaction technical assistance (TA) is being processed at the request of \nthe state Finance Department to support the effective implementation of the program, including \ncapacity building, and help ensure compliance with the second-tranche policy actions.3  \n \n \n \n \n1 Parastatals are supported wholly or partially through grants from the state\u2019s budget and include educational \ninstitutions, statutory boards and corporations, and local governments (urban and rural local bodies). \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 and the policy matrix is in Appendix 4 of the Report and \nRecommendation of the President. \n3  The TA is included in ADB. 2019.

Output 2: Gender-responsive medium-term expenditure framework developed. The \nTA will support the preparation of a gender-responsive medium-term expenditure framework \n(MTEF) by the Department of Women and Child Development and Social Welfare. The MTEF will \nbe linked with the budget for FY2022. A gender impact assessment will be conducted of at least \ntwo of the department's schemes. \n \n8.  Output 3: Social and gender aspects strengthened.

Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The state government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff remuneration, office accommodation \nand supplies, local transport, other logistical support, and other in-kind contributions.
