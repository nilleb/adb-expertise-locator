INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to support selected developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the South Asia Department (SARD)1 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to (i) plan the medium-term recovery from the economic impact of the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19), and (ii) adjust their long-term development strategies to changes in the \nglobal environment brought about by this pandemic. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, \nwhich stresses the importance of stepping up support to its DMCs in combating the effects of the \nglobal health crisis.2 The TA is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which endeavors to \nstrengthen subregional initiatives, e.g., by facilitating knowledge-sharing and collaboration.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  SARD DMCs, like other regions, have been affected by COVID-19, with total cases at \n329,625  as  of  8  June  2020.4 Governments  prioritized  the  saving  of  lives  from  the  health \nemergency and introduced large-scale community quarantine measures (travel restrictions and \nlockdowns) to prevent the spread of the disease and ease the burden on the health systems. \nThese measures have enormous economic impacts because they slowed economic activities to \na substantial degree, leading to the closure of businesses and to job losses. The poor and \nvulnerable, including women, as well as domestic and international migrants have borne the brunt \nof it. Governments provided financial aid in terms of cash transfers and other social security \ninterventions, and also extended support to the corporate sector to offset income losses and keep \nbusinesses afloat. However, economic growth in South Asia will still contract in 2020, with gross \ndomestic product projected at \u20133.0%.5 \n \n4.  ADB and other development partners also helped cushion the short-term impact by \nproviding relief to the DMCs, supplying much-needed medical equipment, building capacity for \nthe health sector, and providing budgetary support with a focus on protecting the poor and most \nvulnerable groups of society. Following these initial efforts, DMCs are starting to plan for economic \nrecovery from the pandemic and adjust their development strategies accordingly. Recovery may \ntake a long time, however.  \n \n5.  Social distancing practices and travel restrictions are likely to continue in the medium-term, \nunless vaccines or effective treatments become available. This would require embracing a new \nway of living for SARD DMCs. Economic recovery plans therefore can only be effective if they \nadopt the requirements of the \u201cnew normal.\u201d Payment systems will need to be moved quickly to \ndigital platforms and mobile applications to maintain some economic activities, businesses need \nto migrate to e-commerce and e-business to sustain operations, and schools need to adopt online \neducation to keep students learning. To restart the businesses, the stress on the banking system \nand  financial  institutions  caused  by  the  rescheduling  of  repayments  and  an  increase  in \nnonperforming loans should be mitigated so that necessary funding can be provided. Flexible \nlabor laws are required to enable the fast recovery of employment and job creation.  \n \n1 The TA targets India and Sri Lanka, which require additional resources for knowledge. Other countries, i.e., \nBangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, and Nepal, will be covered by a future increase in the TA amount. \n2 ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Asian Development Outlook Supplement. Manila. \n ", "2 \n \n6.  Further, taking the momentum gained in the economic recovery from COVID-19, various \nreform  agendas  could  be  implemented,  strengthened,  expanded,  and  institutionalized.  For \ninstance, the extended coverage of the social welfare system under the current pandemic may \nbe  mainstreamed  and  formalized.  Options  for  strengthening  business  resilience,  such  as \nenhancing financial stability and improving financial intermediation, should be explored to ensure \nbetter preparedness for similar outbreaks in the future. The supply chains and logistics of critical \nproducts (such as fuel, food, and pharmaceuticals) may be reassessed and restructured to ensure \ncontinued supply even during emergency situations. National stocks may need to be established \nfor critical products to ensure food security for those that depend on imports. Finally, fiscal \nconsolidation needs to be evaluated and its strategy adjusted to respond to increased domestic \nand international borrowing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \n7.  The TA will help DMCs formulate a policy agenda on these critical issues based on \nextensive analytical studies and supported by updated and reliable data. The results of these \nstudies will include actions plans on how key stakeholders can implement the recommendations.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: selected SARD DMCs\u2019 economies recovered \nfrom COVID-19.6 The TA will have the following outcome: the capacity of governments to design \nmedium-term economic recovery plans and adjust their long-term development strategies to the \neffects of COVID-19 enhanced.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Support for the preparation and/or strengthening of economic recovery \nplans provided. The TA will assess the impacts of COVID-19 on selected priority sectors and \ntheir significance to the economy. This will include an analysis of the components of each topic \nto come up with the status of current situations and identify ways of moving toward economic \nrecovery. Consultations with various stakeholders from the public and private sectors will underpin \nthe formulation of policy measures that would respond to the needs of those most affected, such \nas the poor and vulnerable, including women. The TA will also explore the role of civil society, \ncommunity support, and the private sector in planning and monitoring the economic recovery. It \nis planned to submit at least three knowledge products to governments and organize knowledge-\nsharing events to disseminate the findings of the studies. Topics that may need immediate support \nto better deal with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic could include the following:8 \n(i)  Strengthening the agricultural price monitoring systems by enhancing monitoring \nand evaluation through digital platforms.  \n(ii)  Strengthening the public distribution system for food. \n(iii)  Improving farm-to-fork supply chain systems by exploring interventions through \ncommon service centers. \n(iv)  Strengthening  fintech-based  solutions  to  promote  cashless  transactions  with \nminimal touch points. \n \n6  Defined by the TA. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n8  The health sector, which is not included in this TA, will be covered by TA 9982-REG: Support to Address Outbreak \nof COVID-19 and Strengthen Preparedness for Communicable Diseases in South Asia, which was approved on 20 \nMay 2020.    \n ", "3 \n(v)  Assessing the finance sector, particularly the stress on the banking system to keep \ncredit flowing amid deteriorating credit quality, and formulating policy reforms to \nstabilize the banking system and develop capital markets.  \n(vi)  Facilitating and promoting distance learning and digital education.  \n(vii)  Assessing the impact on the labor market in terms of (i) supply of migrant labor to \nongoing projects; (ii) medium-term job creation for micro, small, and medium-sized \nenterprises; (iii) protection of the most vulnerable workers, including women. \n(viii)  Promoting the business recovery of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. \n(ix)  Strengthening public sector management to help national and local governments \nraise resources to meet immediate and short-term needs.  \n(x)  Expanding access to information and communication technology connectivity. \n \n10.  Agriculture and logistics are being selected to ensure the continued supply of food and \nother important products even during lockdowns and social distancing, while education and \npayment systems gain from adopting methods with less physical contact. Migrant workers suffer \nthe loss of their livelihoods when their host countries implement lockdowns and close international \nborders. Finally, public finance should be strengthened for fiscal consolidation, since many \ncountries increased public debt to finance additional expenditures on the health sector, social \nprotection, and business support. Other topics may be added upon demand from DMCs.   \n \n11.  Output 2: Support to adjust development strategies provided. The TA will analyze \nexisting development strategies of governments and identify what can be modified and improved \nto respond to the changes in the global, regional, and national policy environments brought about \nby COVID-19. The TA will also (i) examine international best practices in responding to crises and \nhighlight those that the DMCs could adopt given their unique economic, social, and political \ncharacteristics;  (ii)  prepare  at  least  two  knowledge  products  which  will  include  policy \nrecommendations; and (iii) organize knowledge-sharing events to disseminate the findings. \nTopics that may need support would include, but are not limited, to the following areas: \n(i)  Logistics. Strengthening the manufacturing supply chains and building on food \nvalue chains, with a focus on the (a) establishment of benchmarks for activities \nsuch  as  storage,  short-  and  long-haul  transport,  handling,  and  distribution; \ninstitutional means for administration and enforcement of such standards; and \nmonitoring systems that enable administrators to make the different logistics \nservice providers accountable for meeting these standards; (b) formulation of \nmultimodal  transport  solutions;  (c)  design  of  programs  with  cluster-specific \napproaches for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises as well as industrial \nand export firms to scale up domestic production in key product lines; and (d) setup \nof self-help groups in supply chains at the village level. \n(ii)  Social schemes. (a) Creation of a common social registry for harmonization \namong various social schemes for efficient benefit delivery mechanism including \ndigitization of systems; (b) Conduct of impact evaluation of pro-poor and/or social \nwelfare schemes and the possibility of convergence for higher impact/benefits; (c) \nAssessment of service delivery in education, skills or social protection to identify \ngaps and in view of the need for digital modes of service delivery; (d) Establishment \nof welfare facilities for the urban poor and construction workers including migrant \nlaborers. Data disaggregated by sex and social aspects will be used to enable an \nextensive analysis of these schemes.  \n(iii)  Migrant  workers.  Explore  possible  solutions  to  their  vulnerability,  such  as \n(a) portability  of  social  sector  benefits  for  workers  outside  their  domicile; \n(b) regional cooperation to handle issues of undue fiscal stress on the host country; \n(c) safety of migrant workers, especially women, who might face prejudice and \n ", "4 \ndiscrimination; (d) food security and financial assistance support to families of \nmigrant  workers;  and  (e)  update  of  databases  of  migrant  workers  with  data \ndisaggregated by gender, age, and disability. \n \n12.  Regional cooperation and integration will be considered to ensure collective action and \ncomplementarity of efforts among SARD DMCs. As regards trade facilitation, there is a need to \nstrengthen the continuity of regional supply chains and achieve faster clearance of cargos at the \nborders to boost cross-border connectivity and enhance trade and investment.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. A future increase in the TA amount is likely as new analytical studies and \nknowledge-sharing opportunities are expected to be added given that the current global health \npandemic may likely to extend for a longer period of time and may delay economic recovery. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  through  SARD's  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations \nCoordination  Division,  in  cooperation  with  SARD  resident  missions,  sector  divisions,  other \nrelevant units and departments of ADB, and the governments of member countries. ADB will \nexplore collaboration with other development partners to avoid duplication of efforts and maximize \nthe use of resources. ADB will engage individual consultants and organize workshops for the \nimplementation of TA activities.  \n \n15.
