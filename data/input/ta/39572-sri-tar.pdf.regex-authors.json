The continued efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka to invigorate the economy and \nreduce poverty by reducing conflict-related poverty and creating opportunities for the poor to \nparticipate in economic activities1 have resulted in strong growth over the last few years. In the \nwake  of  the  tsunami  of  December  2004,  the  Government  has  also  focused  on  continued \ninvestment  to  improve  living  conditions  and  economic  opportunity  in  the  tsunami-affected \nareas.2 To support the Government in rehabilitating conflict- and tsunami-affected areas and to \nsupplement the ongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance for the Rural Finance \nSector Development Program,3 an advisory technical assistance (TA) grant4 was proposed to \nhelp mitigate risks for poor and low-income households5 and facilitate the economic recovery \nand rehabilitation of conflict- and tsunami-affected areas. An ADB fact-finding mission visited Sri \nLanka in September 2005. This TA report reflects the understanding reached by the mission \nwith the Government on the objectives, scope, cost, financing, implementation arrangements, \nand terms of reference of the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  For the poor, building productive assets and increasing income are a long and risky way \nout of poverty. Shocks like illness, fire, or theft can cause severe setbacks in the process of \naccumulating assets, and often force them deeper into poverty. Even shocks that would only \nmildly affect upper- and middle-income households can dramatically reduce the assets of poorer \nhouseholds, eliminate their income sources, reduce consumption, and thus adversely affect \ntheir  ability  to  improve  their  social  and  economic  welfare.  To  cushion  the  shocks,  these \nhouseholds  borrow  from  informal  sources,  withdraw  their  savings,  or  sell  productive  and \nnonproductive assets. But the coverage such mechanisms provide is insufficient and unreliable, \nand, for most poor and lower-income households, no alternative formal institutional mechanism \nof risk mitigation\u2014insurance service6\u2014is available.7 \n \n3.  The insurance sector in Sri Lanka comprises two government insurance schemes, 13 \nprivate insurance companies, and a handful of microfinance nongovernment organizations (MF-\nNGOs) that organize member-based insurance schemes. The Government offers subsidized \nmandatory and voluntary life insurance for those whose incomes are below the poverty line, and \ndeath,  disability,  crop,  and  livestock  insurance  for  low-income  farmers. 8 However,  the \ngovernment schemes are not based on actuarial principles and are deemed unsustainable \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Rural Finance Sector Development Program. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 28 October 2005. \n5  About 40% of the population is below the poverty line (Government of Sri Lanka. 2002. Framework for the Poverty \nReduction. Colombo). The poor and low-income households referred to in this paper are households with a \nmonthly income of SLRs10,000 (about $100) or less in urban areas and SLRs5,000 (about $50) or less in rural \nareas. These households are considered an unviable market and are not served by most insurance companies. \n6  There are various types of insurance, but this paper refers mainly to life (life, credit-life, life-savings, and disability) \ninsurance and general (fire, marine, motor, and miscellaneous) insurance for individual households. Agricultural, \ncrop, weather, or health insurance is beyond the scope of this technical assistance. \n7  Insurance penetration in the country is low, at only 6% of the population for life insurance and 8% for general \ninsurance. \n8  The government scheme includes insurance programs by the Samurdhi Authority and the Agriculture and Agrarian \nInsurance Board. \n ", "2   \nwithout  government  refinancing.  Private  insurance  companies  offer  a  variety  of  insurance \nproducts,  but  they  cater  mainly  to  the  corporate  sector  and  their  client  base  of  individual \ninsurance is highly skewed toward urban and middle- or upper-income households. A few \nMF-NGOs provide insurance services to their members,9 but these MF-NGOs are not licensed \nunder the existing insurance act and their services are largely informal. The premiums of most \nMF-NGO insurance schemes are not actuarially calculated but are often subsidized with donor \nfunding. As the current system has no means to regulate informal schemes, there is growing \nconcern about the protection of insurance policyholders and the viability of the providers. \n \n4.  The insurance industry in Sri Lanka is regulated and supervised by the Insurance Board \nof  Sri  Lanka  (IBSL)  under  the  Insurance  Act  of  2000.  The  Insurance  Act  requires \n(i) capitalization of at least SLRs25 million for life insurance and at least SLRs50 million for \ngeneral  insurance  businesses;  (ii)  conduct  of  insurance  business  only  by  limited-share \ncompanies; (iii) reinsurance of all insurers; (iv) registration of all insurance companies and \nbrokers; and (v) investment of 30% of the long-term fund of life insurance companies, and 20% \nof the technical reserves of general insurance companies, in government securities. \n \n5.  The present concentration of the insurance market in the upper- and middle-income \ngroups  and  the  scarcity  of  services  to  the  lower  segments  of  the  population  are  due  to \n(i) insufficient information about the potential of the poor and lower-income markets and lack of \na cost-efficient mechanism for service delivery by insurance companies or MFI-NGOs that are \nwilling to enter those markets, (ii) limited understanding of the insurance system and benefits \namong poor and low-income households, and (iii) insufficient focus in current institutions and \nregulations on the promotion of microinsurance. \n \n6.  Compared with corporate insurance, individual insurance is considered expensive by the \ninsurance companies because of the high cost of marketing, sales, commissions, underwriting, \nand individual administration. The perceived low capacity of poor households to pay premiums \nfurther deters insurance providers. A vicious cycle has been created: because of the limited \ninterest of the insurance companies, the poor and low-income households know little about \ninsurance services and thus have limited demand for those services, contributing to the lack of \ninterest  among  insurance  companies.  Yet  cost-effective  means  of  delivering  affordable \ninsurance services can be developed by linking insurance services to microfinance operations.10 \nSystematic efforts to establish and disseminate cost-efficient delivery and product models will \nmake insurance providers better able to serve the lower markets. Sri Lanka has no dedicated \nmicroinsurance policies and the requirements of the Insurance Act are considered prohibitive for \ninsurance providers that intend to serve the poor and low-income groups. A policy review and \namendment  focusing  on  microinsurance  promotion  based  on  successful  international \nexperiences11 would facilitate the participation of MF-NGOs12 in life, life-savings, and other \nforms of insurance without compromising the stability of the sector. \n \n                                                 \n9  MF-NGOs\u2019 member-based insurance schemes include credit-life insurance for borrowing members, and provident \nfunds linked to microcredit. \n10  SANASA ALMAO Insurance Company Co., which serves poor and low-income households, offers life insurance \nproducts to members of the SANASA credit cooperative. Most of its clients are low-income households with an \naverage monthly income of up to SLRs7,000. Their insurance benefits depend on the premium that they are willing \nto pay. \n11  The Philippines, for example, has lowered the capital requirements for mutual aid schemes, while Jordan has \nrelaxed the licensing conditions for insurance agents and nongovernment organizations. \n12  Including credit unions and credit cooperatives. \n ", "  3\n7.  Without insurance, the poor may enter into activities and asset portfolios with low risk but \nalso low returns, affecting their long-term income and their ability to move out of poverty. \nFurthermore, shocks may have long-lasting effects: productive assets may be destroyed or sold \nfor survival, health may be undermined, or children may have to leave school. The result is \nhigher poverty that may persist. Reduced risks through effective insurance services will not only \ninduce investment in economic activities but also reduce the welfare costs of the society. \nEffective microinsurance services complemented  with other financial services like credit or \nsavings are considered more concrete protection than other social protection mechanisms like \nthe Government\u2019s income supplementation scheme or community-based mutual associations. \nIn conflict- and tsunami-affected areas, confidence and security with appropriate insurance will \ncontribute to the speedy rehabilitation of the local economy. \n \n8.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  drawing  up  an  integrated  framework  for  the \ndevelopment  of  the  microinsurance  sector  through  favorable  policies  and  sector-wide \ninstitutional  capacity  building.  It  will  (i)  support  the  establishment  of  policies  and  a  legal \nframework conducive to the promotion of microinsurance, and (ii) make insurance services \nmore affordable and accessible to poor and low-income households. A comprehensive sector \nreview will enable policy makers, practitioners, and beneficiaries to understand better the sector \ndevelopment issues and constraints. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is expected to improve risk mitigation and reduce the vulnerability of the poor \nand low-income households in Sri Lanka by facilitating them access to affordable life and \ngeneral insurance products. To support the reconstruction and ease the sense of vulnerability of \nthe affected people, the TA will give emphasis to conflict- and tsunami-affected areas. \n \n10.  As  a  result  of  the  TA,  the  Government,  the  insurance  industry,  MFI-NGOs,  and \ngrassroots organizations are expected to gain a better understanding of microinsurance as an \neffective means of poverty reduction. Microinsurance service providers or potential service \nproviders will improve their grasp of the needs and demand for risk mitigation of the poor and \nlow-income  people,  and  be  able  to  develop  or  tailor  their  services  to  those  needs.  The \nawareness campaign, to be organized in pilot areas, will increase appreciation of insurance \nsystems and benefits among poor and low-income households. \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. Phase 1 will comprise: (i) a policy and legal \nreview, and (ii) a market assessment. Phase 2 will consist of: (i) an awareness campaign, and \n(ii) a pilot microinsurance scheme. \n \n12.  Policy and Legal Review, and Market Assessment. The Insurance Act of 2000 will be \nassessed, and policy and legal improvements based on successful microinsurance schemes in \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nother countries will be recommended, with a view to promoting microinsurance services while \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nm  aintaining the security of insurance policyholders, the financial viability of insurers, and the \nstability of the insurance sector. The capacity of IBSL to regulate and supervise microinsurance \nwill also be reviewed, and, if necessary, IBSL could be provided with capacity-building support. \n ", "4   \n \n13.  The comprehensive market assessment will involve a review of the profile of potential \nmicroinsurance clients\u2014their knowledge and understanding of insurance services, risks, income \nand  expenditure  patterns  (including  seasonality  of  income  and  spending),  ability  to  afford \ninsurance premiums, and association with informal risk mitigation systems like community-\nbased funeral funds. No comprehensive survey of the market for microinsurance in Sri Lanka \nhas  been  made,  and  there  is  strong  interest  among  insurance  companies  in  a  thorough \ninventory of existing and potential microinsurance clients. \n \n14.  The results of the policy review and market assessment will be widely shared through in-\ncountry workshops with government agencies, insurance companies and brokers, microfinance \ninstitutions, MF-NGOs, and donors, and publicized through print and online media. \n \n15.  Pilot Microinsurance Scheme and Awareness Campaign. Many rural communities in \nSri Lanka have a very limited understanding of insurance systems and benefits. An insurance \nawareness  campaign  will  therefore  be  conducted  in  four  districts  in  conflict-  and  tsunami-\naffected areas to be selected in cooperation with MF-MGOs, community-based organizations, \nand cooperatives. The awareness campaign will be followed by the implementation of a pilot \nmicroinsurance scheme. \n \n16.  The pilot scheme will test microinsurance products and delivery modes, and identify \ncost-effective means of providing insurance services especially to households in remote rural \nareas. The microinsurance products to be developed for testing will be based on the market \nassessment and the risks, premium-paying capacity, and socioeconomic specifics of the target \ngroups, as well as the distribution and administration capacity of existing and potential service \nproviders. Delivery modes to be tested will include a partner-agent link between MF-NGOs and \nexisting insurance companies to market microinsurance products in association with microcredit \nactivities.  Actuarial  valuation  for  microinsurance  will  also  be  included.  The  selection  of \nparticipating insurance companies and MF-NGOs will be based on their willingness to enter the \nmicroinsurance market, resources for insurance business, membership or client base, and \nunderstanding  of  the  targeted  poor  and  low-income  groups.  To  make  up  for  any  skill \ndeficiencies, capacity-building development training for MF-NGOs could be organized before \nthe pilot scheme is implemented.13 \n \n17.  The methods, outreach, and results of the awareness campaign and pilot testing will be \nwidely disseminated in the same way as the outputs of the activities in phase 1 (para. 14). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $755,000, consisting of $254,000 in foreign \nexchange  costs  and  $501,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  Poverty  Reduction \nCooperation Fund, which is funded by the Government of the United Kingdom and administered \nby  ADB,  will  fund  $600,000,  comprising  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $346,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The balance will be financed by the Government of Sri \nLanka. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n13  The activities under the TA complement the ongoing Rural Finance Sector Development Program (RFSDP) \n(footnote 3). RFSDP supports the comprehensive capacity development of the microfinance sector including \nproduct development. The results of the TA will be fed back into the capacity-building activities under RFSDP for \nthe dissemination and replication of microinsurance services. \n ", "  5\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) will be the Executing Agency. MOFP will \nform and chair a TA steering committee comprising representatives from MOFP, IBSL, the \nInsurance Association of Sri Lanka,14 and MF-NGOs.15 The TA steering committee, through its \nchairperson  designate,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  implementation.  IBSL  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency and will implement and coordinate the TA activities on behalf of MOFP. \nIBSL, in cooperation with MOFP, will provide office space, one counterpart staff, and support \nservices by its staff. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months from February 2006 to September 2006. \nThree tripartite review meetings involving the TA steering committee, the TA consultants, and \nADB will be organized by IBSL during the TA in connection with ADB missions to review the TA \nimplementation. The meetings will be chaired by MOFP. The TA will require 8 person-months of \ninternational and 38 person-months of domestic consulting services in microinsurance product \ndevelopment,  actuarial  valuation,  microinsurance  law  and  regulation,  market  survey  and \nresearch, awareness creation, and knowledge dissemination. The terms of reference for the \nconsulting services are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nselection  and  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod, with simplified technical proposals, will be used in selecting the consulting firm. The \nprocurement of goods will be subject to the provisions of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nGoods and equipment procured under the TA will be handed over to the Government after the \nTA. \n \n21.  The TA consultants will prepare (i) an inception report including a detailed work program, \nto be submitted within the first 3 weeks and to be discussed at the initial tripartite review \nmeeting; (ii) quarterly reports on the overall progress of work during the period under review, the \nwork program for the next quarter, and any outstanding issues; (iii) an interim report with draft \noutputs, to be submitted within the first 3 months for phase 1, and within the first 6 months for \nphase 2, and to be discussed at the interim tripartite review meetings for phases 1 and 2; (iv) a \ndraft final report compiling all the TA activities, to be submitted at least 1 month before the TA \ncompletion and to be discussed at the final tripartite review meeting; and (v) a final report at the \ncompletion of the TA. MOFP and IBSL will undertake a final evaluation of the TA together with \nADB on the basis of the draft final report. The final version of this report, to be prepared by the \nconsultants, will reflect the conclusions reached at the final tripartite review meeting. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB\u2019s \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to the Government \nof Sri Lanka to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for \nMicroinsurance Sector Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n \n14  Thirteen private insurance companies are members of the insurance industry association in Sri Lanka. \n15 The selection of MF-NGOs will be based on their involvement, or willingness to be involved, in the insurance \nmarket. \n ", "6     Appendix 1 \n \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \n  Mechanisms   \n \nImpact       \n       \nImproved access to  One year after the  Policy documents of the  Risk  \naffordable life and general  technical assistance  Government including the  \u2022 Government\u2019s willingness to \ninsurance products and  (TA) completion:  central bank  establish the appropriate \nreduced vulnerability of the      policy environment  \npoor and low-income  Government policies  TA completion report   \nhouseholds in Sri Lanka,  and legal framework    Assumption \nespecially in conflict- and  more conducive to the  Impact assessment report  \u2022 Absence of conflict  \ntsunami-affected areas  promotion of \n  microinsurance for poor \nand low-income \nhouseholds \n \nIncreased availability of \nlife and nonlife \ninsurance products to \npoor and low-income \nhouseholds \n \nLivelihoods of conflict- \nand tsunami-affected \nhouseholds restored, \nwith appropriate risk \nmitigation and \ninsurance \n \nOutcome       \n  At the TA completion:     \n      Assumption  \nEnabling policy environment  Recommendations from  Recommended policy and  \u2022 Absence of conflict \nfor the promotion of  the policy and legal  legal amendments \nmicroinsurance  review    \n    TA completion report \nIncreased  awareness  and  Increased knowledge  TA review missions \navailability of microinsurance  and skills of insurance   \n  companies and  Consultants\u2019 reports \nmicrofinance institutions  Impact assessment study \n(MFIs) in \nmicroinsurance \nbrokerage and \ndistribution \n \nSuccessful marketing of \npilot-tested \nmicroinsurance \nproducts, and methods \nof replication \nestablished \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2    7 \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \n  Mechanisms   \n \nOutputs       \n  During TA     \n  implementation:  TA review missions  Risk  \n      \u2022 Government\u2019s willingness to \n1.
