INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) implement Strategy 2030 by strengthening poverty and social analysis (PSA) in \nsupport of the operational priority 1 (OP1) agenda on addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities.1 The TA will (i) review and update guidance and analytical tools used to identify, \nassess, and address the poverty and social dimensions of ADB\u2019s operations; (ii) provide capacity \nbuilding and technical support for developing member countries (DMCs) on designing and \nimplementing projects that focus on strengthening poverty reduction and social inclusion; (iii) \nundertake strategic research on emerging vulnerability and social issues in Asia and the Pacific; \nand (iv) support DMCs in implementing innovative PSA approaches. \n \n2.  The TA was endorsed during the corporate priority framework meeting in November 20182 \nand is included in the management-approved 2019 results-based work plan of the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department (SDCC).3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  After decades of sustained growth, Asia and the Pacific has transformed into one of the \nmost dynamic areas in the world, but it also has clear and persistent disparities. Extreme poverty \nhas been dramatically reduced, and more than 95% of developing Asia\u2019s population live in middle-\nincome countries. However, about 264 million people still live below the $1.90/day poverty line, \nand the 1.1 billion  people who live on less than $3.20/day are particularly vulnerable to shocks \nand are at risk of falling back into poverty.4 Income inequality in countries has risen or remained \nat a high level, and significant nonincome disparities exist in access to decent jobs, quality \neducation and training, health services, and social protection. Access to and affordability of basic \nservices such as electricity, water and sanitation, and transport remain a challenge for many \npeople in Asia and the Pacific. Urbanization, climate change, demographic transition, digital \ntechnology, the changing nature of work, and migration all risk the creation of new vulnerabilities \nand  vulnerable  groups.  Significant  gender  disparities  persist  and  often  intersect  with  other \nvulnerabilities, thereby limiting potential for growth and attainment of equal opportunities for half \nof the population in Asia and the Pacific. \n \n4.  Strategy 2030 acknowledges the complexities of Asia and the Pacific and calls for a focus \non addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities under OP1. The Operational Plan for \nOP1 highlights the need for all sectors to address the inequality of access to opportunities, \nespecially for poor and vulnerable people.5 To do this effectively, robust PSA needs to be \nundertaken to better understand the complex contexts and interaction of social, economic, \npolitical, and institutional forces in DMCs; anticipate projects\u2019 differentiated impacts on various \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

The South Asia Department (SARD) is \nsupplementing this with $500,000 (also from TASF-other sources) for social inclusion work in SARD countries.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 October 2019. \n4  ADB  (Economic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation  Department).  2018.

OP1 stresses the role of investments in human capital and social protection and the importance \nof quality jobs as necessary enablers for creating inclusive societies that are resilient to risks, have the potential to \nachieve prosperity, and are sustainable. \n \n ", "2 \nsocial groups; and use this information to better address vulnerability in country partnership \nstrategies and programs, target projects, and design measures to support inclusion, access, \naffordability, and participation. \n \n5.  Strengthening the capacity of governments to conduct PSA and integrate findings into \nnational poverty reduction and social inclusion agendas and project design is needed. In many \ncountries, PSA approaches are limited, applied inconsistently, and focused strongly on risk and \nsafeguards. They do not (i) address the broader issues of heterogeneity in poverty, vulnerability, \nand inequality; or (ii) incorporate an assessment of the different impacts on poor and vulnerable \ngroups,  including  disadvantaged  youth;  older  people;  people  with  disabilities;  and  those \ndiscriminated against based on their gender, ethnicity, religion, class, or sexual identity. ADB has \ndeveloped  good  guidance  on  PSA,6  which  should  be  updated  to  (i)  address  links  to  the \nSustainable Development Goals; (ii) outline good practices for all lending modalities (e.g., results-\nbased lending); (iii) align the analyses for sovereign and nonsovereign projects; (iv) clarify how \nthe broad umbrella of PSA should be resourced and organized to feed into project design and \nkey areas of analysis, such as gender, participation, and safeguards; (v) integrate guidance for \nselected sectors, such as urban development,7 and develop new guidance in areas such as rural \ndevelopment or disability inclusion; and (vi) identify and integrate good practices and tools that \nhave been developed in DMCs or by TA and loan projects from ADB or other development \npartners. There is a need to (i) ensure that the tools and guidance better address the diversity of \nissues, social groups, and definitions of poverty and vulnerability across countries and regions; \n(ii) strengthen capacity in DMCs (through ADB projects\u2019 executing and implementing agencies) \nto implement PSA and, with governments and other development partners, develop harmonized \napproaches to monitoring and reporting; and (iii) help ensure that the tools and capacity building \nare adequately aligned with national poverty reduction and inclusivity agendas. \n \n6.  Undertaking strategic research is critical for keeping DMCs and ADB abreast of emerging \nissues and enabling them to address these issues in innovative and comprehensive ways. To \nquickly adapt and develop effective responses to rapid social and economic changes, conducting \ntargeted research on emerging poverty and inclusion issues and differential impacts on vulnerable \npopulations is necessary. Key areas for investigation include disability inclusion, climate change \nand disaster resilience, migration and displacement, and impacts of technology or other disruptors \nin sectors.8 Disability inclusion is a particular area where targeted research and strengthened \noperational approaches are needed. Of the 1 billion people with some form of disability globally, \n70% live in Asia and the Pacific. Many people with a disability face extreme poverty because of \nlack of access to and exclusion from opportunities. They represent one of the most left behind \nsegments of the population. The urban poor are among the most vulnerable to shocks as they \nhave fewer assets, are typically excluded from formal decision-making processes, and often live \nin unorganized settlements in the most hazardous parts of cities that are at a higher risk of being \naffected by climate change and disaster-related events. Targeted research in emerging areas will \nhelp improve the quality of analysis and design of interventions, and facilitate the development of \na network of researchers and collaborators across DMCs in Asia and the Pacific and improve \nknowledge dissemination. \n \n7.  Supporting innovation in PSA will help create better and more impactful projects and \nreplicable approaches. Using technologies such as geographic information systems; designing \n \n6  ADB. 2012.

In response to these challenges and issues, the TA will strengthen analytical tools and \nprocesses for PSA, improve capacity in DMCs, and develop knowledge and collaboration on new \nareas for engagement. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: remaining poverty and inequalities in the \nregion addressed (footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: pro-poor and social \ninclusion design elements in ADB operations improved.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Analytical tools for poverty and social inclusion updated and shared with \ndeveloping member countries. Effective assessment, from country strategies to project design, \nis necessary to develop a strong focus on OP1 priorities on poverty reduction and social inclusion. \nThe TA team will revisit and update the Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis and related \ndocumentation such as the initial poverty and social analysis and the summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy. The team will also prepare PSA tools, such as guidance notes and tip sheets, \nrelevant to the Strategy 2030 operational priorities and sector operations and aligned with DMC \nneeds and ADB financial instruments, including for urban sector operations, taking into account \nthe need for inclusive design. Taking into account the different financing instruments and nature \nof nonsovereign operations, tools and guidance notes will also be developed to support the \nPrivate Sector Operations Department\u2019s borrowers and clients. Printing of the handbook, tools, \nand guidance notes will be limited and happen on demand. Training modules will be developed \nand implemented to support capacity building in DMCs. A network of experts across the DMCs \nwill be established to support the exchange of good practices and continued capacity building. \n \n11.  To  develop  a  stronger  understanding  of  and  focus  on  poverty  and  the  complex \nintersectionality of social inequalities, the TA team will conduct research and training activities \nwith the South Asia Department (SARD) to develop a framework for integrating social inclusion in \nall SARD country operations. Close examination of specific regional issues and applications will \nprovide useful lessons and a replicable approach for other regional departments. \n \n12.  Output 2: Strategic research and knowledge exchange on poverty reduction and \nsocial inclusion strengthened. Disability, climate change and disaster risks, demographic \ntransition, digital technology, migration, and displacement are examples of areas where some of \nthe greatest change and social impacts are taking place in Asia and the Pacific and new \nvulnerabilities are being created. The TA will support strategic research and collaboration on \nemerging issues to improve knowledge and strengthen operational approaches to addressing the \ndifferential impacts. Consultative and participatory approaches to identifying opportunities for \nfurther strengthening social inclusion will be employed in DMCs. Governments, nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and civil society organizations will be consulted to distill social inclusion \ntrends and practices and to identify entry points to strengthen the social inclusion focus and impact \n \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nof ADB operations. Engagement forums on such issues as stocktaking on social inclusion in \nSouth Asia and male engagement in gender equality will help raise awareness, build common \nunderstanding, and share international good practices. ADB will engage the services of the Global \nDisability Innovation Hub (GDIH) to support disability inclusion through inclusive design and \nassistive technology. The research studies and engagement forums will inform the development \nof tools and capacity building materials for DMCs (output 1). \n \n13.  Output 3: Innovative approaches to poverty and social analysis applied in selected \nprojects. Prioritizing demand at regional and/or country level and using the results of output 2, \nthe TA will provide resources for (i) testing pioneering PSA approaches and (ii) integrating the \nanalysis of poverty and social issues into the design and implementation of innovative projects \nwith strong focus on poverty reduction and social inclusion (including gender). All DMCs and \nregional departments will be eligible to request funds. The criteria, guidelines, and approval \nprocess are in the attached a supplementary document. . \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.25 million, of which (i) $1.75 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and (ii) $500,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund10 under the \nUrban Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  Financing by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund supports (i) integration \nand leverage, identifying opportunities for scaling up ADB operations in urban development, with \na particular focus on disability inclusion and climate change resilience; and (ii) knowledge \ngeneration, dissemination, and use, including developing case studies, practice guides, and other \nknowledge products; and supporting knowledge dissemination platforms that promote sharing of \nlessons between target cities and wider audiences and build evidence around urban climate \nchange adaptation in practice.11 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA, with overall coordination by SDCC\u2019s Social Development \nThematic Group (SDTG) secretariat. The SDTG secretariat will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants; organize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons in workshops. \nGiven the range of SARD-specific activities, a focal point and support team from SARD will lead \nimplementation of those activities and work in collaboration with the SDTG secretariat. A core \nworking group will be mobilized from the Gender Equity Thematic Group; NGO and Civil Society \nCenter; SDCC\u2019s Safeguards Division; the Private Sector Operations Department; the Strategy, \nPolicy,  and  Partnerships  Department;  other  sector  and  thematic  groups;  and  operations \ndepartments to ensure ownership and provide inputs. Reporting will be made to the SDTG \nCommittee to monitor TA progress. \n   \n \n10 Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \n11 Financing by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF) will prioritize countries covered by \nUCCRTF (i.e., Bangladesh, Indonesia, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, and Viet Nam). \n ", "5 \n17.

The GDIH will be recruited using single source selection to provide consulting services. \nThe organization is of exceptional worth for the assignment. Based in the United Kingdom, the \nGDIH is a consortium of 20 entities representing academia, the private sector, and NGOs and \nhas a vast network of partners working on disability inclusion and a particular focus on working in \ndeveloping countries. It is a leading institution on inclusive design, smart city development, and \nassistive technology. ADB has been working with the GDIH for more than a year on disability \ninclusion. ADB and the GDIH are working on the implementation of a disability project in Mongolia \nand on a global case study on affordable housing in preparation for an urban development project. \nIn Georgia, the GDIH supported the preparation of legislation on inclusive design, which has been \nadopted in Tbilisi and will be used in other urban areas to be supported under the future Livable \nCities Investment Program (Multitranche Financing Facility).13 Under the TA, the GDIH will build \non  these  initiatives  to  further  strengthen  disability  inclusion  during  project  design  and \nimplementation of urban sector projects. \n \n \n12 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n13 ADB. 2019.
