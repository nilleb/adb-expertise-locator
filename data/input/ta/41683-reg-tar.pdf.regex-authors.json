Effective infrastructure regulation is vital for delivering water and energy services of an \nappropriate quality and cost to consumers and for ensuring that investing in infrastructure is \nattractive to the private sector. Water and energy infrastructure underpins the delivery of basic \nservices that are essential for pro-poor development1 and infrastructure development is a focus \narea in the medium-term strategy II (2006\u20132008) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 Over \nthe past two decades, ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) have undertaken significant \nregulatory  reform  of  infrastructure  and  utility  service  delivery.  However,  despite  recent \nimprovements,  in  many  developing  countries  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region  the  operating \nefficiency and quality of infrastructure still lag behind international standards. Underlying policy, \ninstitutional, and regulatory frameworks need to be established and to be operating well.  \n \n2.  In 1997, ADB conducted a regional technical assistance (RETA) project on Governance \nand  Regulatory  Regimes  for  Private  Infrastructure  Development3 to  assess  the  impact  of \ngovernance4 and regulatory reforms in several Asian countries.5 This RETA is still a leading \nsource of information on governance and regulatory regimes in Asia and one of only a few \ncomparative studies of regulatory institutions in Asia. Since 1997, the academic and policy \nliterature has expanded as has ADB\u2019s operational experience with policies, institutions, and \nregulation. ADB and its DMCs recognize there is a need for further analysis of successful and \nunsuccessful regulation in DMCs.  Building on the 1997 RETA, and on subsequent work by \nADB and other development partners, this RETA6 further investigates the formal and informal \nattributes of effective regulatory reform and governance in Asia through investigating regulatory \nreform in selected DMCs. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Over the past two decades, Asia\u2019s developing countries have undertaken varying levels \nof regulatory reform. The first wave of reforms has produced mixed results, for which various \nreasons  have  been  attributed.  These  reasons  include  that  (i)  models  of  pricing  and  \u201cbest \nregulation\u201d from developed countries and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) were often transplanted in developing countries without full consideration \nof the different contexts; (ii)  many policy and governance reform processes were incomplete \nand  measures  designed  to  be  transitional  became  end-points;  (iii)  regulators  were  not \nindependent  and  even  \u201ccredible\u201d  regulation  was  difficult  to  achieve;  (iv)  implementation  of \nreforms was hindered by poor governance; (v) the institutional context was not conducive to \nreform and regulatory issues were often more complex than in OECD countries;7 (vi) capacity \n                                                 \n1  ADB\u2019s water financing program for 2006\u20132010 is designed to double investments in the water sector and is \ndirected at reforms and capacity development programs in rural communities, cities, and river basins. This RETA\u2019s \nfocus on regulation will complement these priorities. ADB\u2019s water and energy policies recognize the need for better \nregulatory governance and substance. See: ADB. 2001.

There is broad agreement8 on the attributes of \neffective  regulation,  which  includes  clarity  of  roles  and  objectives,  autonomy,  participation, \naccountability, transparency, predictability, non-discrimination, proportionality, requisite powers, \nappropriate institutional characteristics, and integrity.9 In evaluating these, both formal attributes \n(such as the design of the regulatory framework) and informal attributes (such as the way the \nframework works in practice) must be considered. Less attention has been paid to date on \ninformal attributes of regulatory frameworks. \n \n4.  In evaluating the effectiveness of a regulatory framework, both regulatory governance \nand  regulatory  substance  must  be  considered.10 Regulatory  governance  is  the  \u201chow\u201d  of \nregulation\u2500it deals with the legal design of the regulatory system, the institutional arrangements \nand  the  process  of  regulatory  decision  making.  Regulatory  substance  is  the  \u201cwhat\u201d  of \nregulation\u2500it  involves  decisions  on  tariffs,  quality,  accounting,  investment,  and  social \nobligations.11 The objective of good regulatory governance is good regulatory substance\u2500to \nhave  competent  and  credible  regulatory  decisions.  Thus,  both  regulatory  governance  and \nregulatory substance are intertwined in achieving effective regulation and regulatory reform.  \n \n5.  Some work has already been done to assess regulatory effectiveness in Asian countries. \nAn  informal  survey  of  East  Asian  and  Pacific  utility  regulators  for  the  Fourth  Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation (APEC) Privatization Forum in 2003 revealed that East Asian regulators \nface issues that are harder to resolve than those in developed countries and that they have to \naddress them with less capacity and fewer resources.12 The Asian Development Bank Institute \n(ADBI) reached a similar conclusion in a 2004 paper on Infrastructure Regulation: Models for \nDeveloping  Asia.13   It  recommended  further  research  into  (i)  the  nature  of  information \nasymmetries within Asian developing economies and how these may be addressed, (ii) the role \nof incentives in different regulatory regimes and lessons learned, (iii) the rationale for regulatory \npractice and the comparative roles of market failure and political capture, (iv) the extent to which \n\u201cgood\u201d regulation can be realistically achieved in a developing country and the implications for \nregulatory reform, (v) optimal regulatory structures (and the relevance of independent regulation \nwhere capacity is weak), (vi) the relationship between utility regulation and broader regulatory \nprocesses, and (vii) the need for capacity building and the form this should take.  \n \n6.  In 2005, a survey of consumer participation in infrastructure regulation in East Asia and \nthe  Pacific  was  conducted  by  the  World  Bank. 14  This  survey  considered  (i)  whether \ninfrastructure  regulation  in  the  region  met  the  main  institutional  requirements  for  effective \nconsumer  participation,  (ii)  whether  regulators  were  performing  their  functions  vis-\u00e0-vis \n                                                 \n8 Cubbin,  John,  and  Jon  Stern.  2005.

Tokyo: ADBI. \n14 Forty-five regulatory bodies in 21 countries were considered, of which 17 are independent agencies, including \nthose in Cambodia; the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic; the Philippines; and Thailand.   \n ", "  3\nconsumers  effectively,  (iii)  whether  regulators  relied  on  stakeholders  and  intermediaries  to \ninvolve  consumers  in  the  regulatory  process,  and  (iv)  whether  regulators  had  in  place \nmechanisms to involve the poor in the regulatory process. The survey was based upon formal \nattributes of the systems and the response of regulators and not on the views of consumers or \non-the-ground research. A study in 2007 did report on consumer perspectives, but more needs \nto be done in this regard.15 In 2006, the World Bank made a significant contribution to research \nby publishing a handbook with an analytical framework for conducting practical case studies of \nregulatory systems.16 There is a need to apply this framework to actual regulatory systems in \nAsia.  \n \n7.  Most of the extensive analysis of infrastructure regulation has been at a theoretical and \npolicy level. There have been few case studies that can be used in a practical way to improve \ninfrastructure and utility service regulation in Asian DMCs. Of the case studies that do exist, \nincluding those in the earlier ADB RETA, most have focused on the formal aspects of the \nregulatory frameworks (i.e., on formal laws, regulations, rules, structures, and tariff-setting) and \ntheir  impact  on  overall  regulatory  reform.  There  has  not  been  enough  assessment  of  the \ninformal attributes of regulatory frameworks (i.e. how they work in practice) and the perspectives \nof private sector investors, consumers, and the poor on the effectiveness of regulatory systems \nhave not been taken sufficiently into account. \n \n8.  Effective regulation is limited by the formal lack of legal frameworks. Informal attributes \nthat  also  act  as  obstacles  to  effective  regulation  in  DMCs  include  information  asymmetry, \nmarket failure, political capture, weak capacity, and ineffective consumer participation. There is \na  need  for  further  detailed  investigation  of  these  obstacles,  including  how  and  why  these \nobstacles persist and the impact of regulatory systems on policy makers, consumers, and \ninvestors. Results can feed into the governance, institutional, and corruption risk assessments \nfor the water and energy sectors in the DMCs.17   \n \n9.  There has not been enough analysis in Asia of the need to (i) ensure infrastructure \nservice delivery to poor consumers, and (ii) reflect clean energy and energy efficiency issues in \nthe regulatory reform models that have already been adopted. The quality and experience of the \nregulators is another factor that is often overlooked. Regulatory systems with good policies, \nstrong government commitment, and intense concern for consumers and investors may still fail \nbecause of a lack of capacity. Finally, the question of whether it is possible to have effective \nregulatory agencies in countries without effective consumer representation or active and vigilant \ncivil society groups needs to be addressed. The lessons from the 1997 RETA and the work \ndone  by  ADB  and  others  is  that  a  systematic  comparative  case  study  that  evaluates  the \neffectiveness of formal and informal attributes of regulatory systems is required to define the \ncontours of further reform. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n15 Nakhooda, Smita, Shantanu Dixit, and Navroz K.

Currently, ADB is in the process of drafting guidelines for its staff \non the implementation of the second governance and anticorruption action plan.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of this RETA is expected to be improved design and implementation of water \nand energy sector reforms by DMCs and their development partners (including ADB) as a result \nof an improved understanding of the effectiveness of the water and energy regulatory reforms \nso far undertaken. The outcome of this RETA will be to identify and publish institutional and \ntechnical  factors  influencing  the  effectiveness  of  water  and  energy  regulatory  reforms \nundertaken in selected DMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The methodology for conducting the RETA will involve literature reviews and case-study \ninvestigations into the formal and informal attributes of water and energy regulation in several \nDMCs, which shall employ modes such as survey questionnaires of existing and potential \nprivate investors in water and energy infrastructure, DMC citizens and consumers of water and \nenergy utility services, and DMC government officials. The following criteria will be used to \nselect the DMCs for the case studies: (i) the countries should have a regulatory framework for \nthe water and energy sectors; (ii) regulatory data should be available; and (iii) there should be a \nrepresentative mix of countries, reflecting economic and cultural diversity, and there should be a \nbalance between subregions. \n \n12.  The  key  activities  will  be  (i)  a  literature  survey  of  issues  relating  to  infrastructure \nregulation and its reform; (ii) a review of ADB\u2019s experience in relevant DMCs; (iii) field research \ninto formal and informal policies and the institutional and regulatory frameworks in several \nDMCs; (iv) at least one workshop per DMC to solicit views from stakeholders; (v) external and \ninternal peer review of the draft report of findings; (vi) workshops involving ADB staff to explain \nthe  findings  of  the  RETA  and  to  consider  their  relevance  for  ADB\u2019s  operational  work  in \ninfrastructure policy; (vii) broad dissemination of the results of the investigation through written \nand web-based publications and workshops involving DMC officials, consumers, and investors; \nand (viii) strengthening of a series of ADB knowledge products currently being prepared. \n \n13.  The  findings  will  seek  to  expand  and  deepen  ADB\u2019s  knowledge  of  infrastructure \nregulation and to produce publications that share this knowledge within ADB, with DMCs, and \nwith other development partners. In disseminating the results, ADB will seek to use and build on \nsuch networks as the East Asia and Pacific Infrastructure Regulatory Forum, the South Asia \nForum  of  Infrastructure  Regulators,  the  Central  Asian  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  on \nInfrastructure,  and  the  Public-Private  Infrastructure  Advisory  Facility,  to  which  ADB  is  a \ncontributor.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The RETA is estimated to cost $564,000, to be financed by ADB on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. This amount will finance the research, workshops, consultants, and \npublication of the report. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB, through the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), will be the Executing Agency for \nand will be responsible for overall management and monitoring of activities. The counterpart \nagencies  in  the  participating  DMCs  will  be  identified  by  OGC  in  conjunction  with  ADB\u2019s \noperations departments.18 OGC will collaborate with and coordinate departments involved in the \nprovision of infrastructure as well as with the ADB communities of practice for water and energy \nand the Regional Sustainable Infrastructure Division (RSID). OGC is currently collaborating with \nRSID on various energy and water-related projects. OGC will also coordinate with the ADB \nInstitute, the World Bank, and other development partners.  \n \n16.  All  consulting  services  for  the  project  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  It is estimated that \nup to 32 person-months of consulting services will be required, of which 8 person-months will be \nperformed by international consultants and 24 person-months by national consultants. These \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  through  a  firm  following  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures on the basis of bio-data proposals. In addition, resource persons will be recruited for \n2.5 person-months to conduct a peer review and to assist ADB. Consultants will work closely \nwith specialists in the operations departments and resident missions of the participating DMCs \nand designated government counterparts. The outline terms of reference of consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n17.  The RETA will be implemented over 15 months, starting in April 2008 and ending in July \n2009. The consultants will submit inception, progress, draft final, and final reports. The outline of \nthe final report is in Appendix 4. The consultants will organize (i) one workshop for each \nparticipating DMC to solicit views from stakeholders; (ii) one workshop for each participating \nDMC to discuss the findings; (iii) one regional workshop to discuss the draft final report, share \npractical information on the challenges faced in establishing effective regulation, and identify \nkey areas for improvement of water and energy regulatory reforms; and (iv) two or three \nworkshops at ADB to discuss the findings with relevant ADB staff. Reporting requirements for \nthe consultants are as follows: (i) an inception report within 4 weeks of RETA commencement; \n(ii) individual country reports, including summaries of proceedings of national workshops; (iii) a \ndraft  final  report  at  least  1  month  before  the  regional  workshop;  and  (iv)  a  final  report \nsummarizing the outputs with an appropriately documented list of the achievements.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $564,000 on a grant basis for \nEnhancing Effective Regulation of Water and Energy Infrastructure and Utility Services, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n18  Any activity funded by this RETA will begin only after ADB has received a statement of no-objection in writing from \nthe government of the DMC concerned. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact       \nImproved design and  Number of DMC water and  Water and energy sector  Assumption \nimplementation of water and  energy sector reform  reform documents in  DMCs are committed  to \nenergy sector reforms by DMCs  programs incorporating good  selected DMCs  water  and  energy  sector \nand their development partners,  practices identified in the    reforms \nincluding ADB  study  Program approval and   \n  evaluation documents of \nbilateral and multilateral \ndevelopment \norganizations \nOutcome      Risk \nInstitutional and technical factors  Study published and  ADB records  DMCs do not see this \ninfluencing the effectiveness of  disseminated to relevant    research as a priority \nwater and energy regulatory  agencies in all DMCs and to  need. \nreforms in selected DMCs are  development partners \nidentified and published   \nNumber of website \ndownloads of publications \nOutputs      Assumption \nSuccesses and obstacles to  Consensus among ADB and  Survey of key ADB and  Governments will \neffective infrastructure regulation  DMC stakeholders that  DMC stakeholders  nominate key officials with \nin selected DMCs are identified,  successes and obstacles  decision-making power to \ntogether with suggestions to  and the suggested solutions  attend workshops. \novercome them  identified in the study are \nrealistic \n \n Professional peer review \nActivities   Inputs \n1.1 Carry out literature survey of issues relating to regulation  \u2022  $564,000 ADB grant \n1.2 Review ADB TA, program, and project experience in relevant DMCs.  \u2022  Consulting inputs \n  \u2022  Resource and time \n2.1 Carry out research to compile case studies of formal and informal policy, institutional, and  commitment from key \nregulatory frameworks in several ADB DMCs  government officials \n2.2 Conduct at least one workshop per DMC to solicit views from stakeholders and collect  with decision-making \nfield data.  powers and regulators  \n  \u2022  Stakeholder inputs \n3.1  Prepare draft report of findings. \n\u2022  Civil society inputs \n3.2  Ensure external and internal peer review of draft report of findings \n\u2022  Consumer inputs \n \n4.1  Conduct one workshop per DMC to discuss findings. \n4.2  Conduct one regional workshop to discuss findings. \n4.3  Train ADB staff to explain regulation issues in projects. \n \n5.1  Publish results in ADB knowledge products and on the website. \n5.2  Database recording successes and failures of existing regulatory reforms in  selected \nDMCs \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DMC = developing member country, RETA = regional technical assistance. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  7 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Financinga   \n  1.
