INTRODUCTION \n1.  In  2004,  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  (the  Government)  requested  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assistance to prepare a project to improve agricultural productivity \nthrough rehabilitation and improved management of irrigation schemes. The project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA)1 was initially included in the ADB country strategy and program for \n2005\u20132007.2 However, following a reconnaissance mission in 2004, processing of the PPTA \nwas  suspended  pending  progress  on  proposed  restructuring  of  the  National  Irrigation \nAdministration (NIA) and the Government\u2019s confirmation of budget for the project. Following \nconfirmation that (i) the NIA rationalization plan was initiated through Executive Order No. 718, \n8 April 2008; and (ii) the reformulated Irrigation System Operation Efficiency Improvement \nProject was included in the Government investment plan, an ADB fact-finding mission was \nconducted from 2 to 13 June 2008. The mission reached an understanding with NIA on the \nPPTA design including impact, outcome, implementation arrangements, financing plan, and \nterms of reference for consultants. The PPTA design and monitoring framework is Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector  is  a  significant  determinant  of  overall \neconomic growth in the Philippines. In 2006, it accounted for 19.1% of gross domestic product \nand provided employment for about 36.7% of the labor force. Agriculture is critical to poverty \nreduction as poverty incidence in the country is largely a rural phenomenon.4 Strengthening \nrural economies by accelerating agriculture and rural development is a critical component for an \ninclusive growth strategy to reduce rural poverty.5 By actively promoting agricultural and rural-\nbased opportunities, jobs can be created and rural to urban migration slowed. Promotion of \nyield-improving  technologies  and  expansion  into  high-value  commodities  and  value-adding \nservices are central elements of efforts to meet much-anticipated opportunities for employment \nand income growth in less well-developed regions of the country, as set out in the Medium-Term \nPhilippine Development Plan (MTPDP) for 2004\u20132010.6  \n \n3.  Agricultural production issues came into sharp focus in 2008 when international grain \nprices, including those for rice, soared with a 40% increase between March 2007 and March \n2008.7 In March 2008, the Government asked ADB for assistance in rehabilitating irrigation \ninfrastructure and postharvest facilities for rice. Rice is the basic food staple for the population. \nAs one of the largest importers of rice in the world, the higher rice price stimulated urgent efforts \nto return the country to self-sufficiency in rice production by 2013 through the development of \nseveral  agricultural  initiatives.8 Irrigated  agriculture  accounts  for  about  76%  of  annual  rice \nproduction and is therefore a major focus of the new initiatives on food security.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The name of the project at that time was the irrigation rehabilitation project. \n2  ADB. 2005.

The Philippines achieved self-sufficiency in rice in about 1970 as a result of steady \ninvestments in irrigation and green revolution technologies. However, during the last decades of \nthe 20th century, the rate of increase of production slowed due to recurrent droughts and \nreductions  in  investment  in  public  sector  agricultural  support  services,  such  as  research, \nextension, and irrigation development. While investment in the sector increased in recent years \nleading  to  rice  production  increasing  at  an  annual  rate  of  about  3.7%  since  2000,  the \npersistently high population growth rate of 2.3% results in a routine requirement to import, i.e., \nup to 1.8 million tons of rice in 2008.  \n \n5.  While the importance of irrigation in reducing the risk of crop failure and increasing crop \nproductivity is undisputed, the performance of irrigation investments have often fallen short of \nexpectations created during project design. A number of generic issues affect many irrigation \nsystems in the Philippines: \n \n(i)  Overoptimistic system development assumptions. Designed service areas \ntend to be larger than available water resources. Limited hydrological records do \nnot allow data-based hydrological analysis on water availability. Often the service \narea requires farmers to convert land, but due to shortage of resources and the \nvalue of existing crops, such lands are not developed.  \n \n(ii)  Inadequate operation and maintenance, and limited farmer participation. \nLimited operation and maintenance (O&M) activities result in deteriorating canals \nand  structures,  and  silted  and  defective  diversion  works.  O&M  costs  are \nexpected to be covered by irrigation service fees, but collection efficiency is very \nlow. Most O&M funding is utilized for NIA personnel and little remains for actual \nO&M. The irrigation management transfer (IMT) program aims to transfer system \nmanagement  to  the  implementing  agencies  and  thus  reduce  O&M  costs. \nAcceleration of IMT will depend on NIA rationalization and restructuring under the \nforthcoming World Bank irrigation project.9 \n \n(iii)  System deterioration. Irrigation development accelerated after the creation of \nNIA in 1963; however many of the schemes developed are now aging and have \naccumulated damage through natural calamities such that they are not able to \nfulfill the expected functions. Many systems now require comprehensive and \nsystematic upgrading to bring them to full operating status. \n \n6.  Upgrading  irrigation  infrastructure  and  operations  without  adequate  attention  to  the \nparticipation  of  beneficiaries  in  the  design  of  project  investments  and  development  of  the \nagricultural system is not likely to be successful and/or sustainable. The Southern Philippines \nIrrigation Sector Project has been successful in involving farmers in participatory planning and \ndesign of subproject investments.10 Projects without adequate attention to agricultural support \nservices will not achieve expected increases in crop yields and improved household income. \nEffective system management and agricultural development programs11 must be an essential \ncore activity in irrigation rehabilitation or development projects if system users are to obtain \nmaximum benefit from investments.  \n                                                 \n9  The Participatory Irrigation Development Project, under preparation for financing by a World Bank adaptable \nprogram loan in 2008, will partially fund the costs of the rationalization plan. Approval of the $70 million adaptable \nprogram loan is expected in January 2009. \n10  ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of the Philippines for the Southern Philippines Irrigation Sector Project. Manila \n11  System management and agricultural development program has been implemented in the Southern Philippines \nIrrigation System Project supported by ADB.  ", "  3 \n \n7.  Government\u2019s Response. The Government, in its MTPDP for 2004\u20132010 (footnote 6) \nset development strategies for the agriculture sector based on two main goals: (i) expanding the \nproduction base, and (ii) increasing productivity. The MTPDP identifies Mindanao as a focal \narea for agricultural development in view of the high potential for a diverse range of crops and \nagribusiness ventures. Under the MTPDP, self-sufficiency in rice production is identified as a \nkey component of the agriculture productivity goal; and the primary target of the 10-point legacy \nagenda of the President is to increase rice production, a key goal for most provinces. In \nresponse to the \u201crice-crisis\u201d in 2008, the Government committed resources to increase rice \nproduction to meet projected demand of 19.8 million tons in 2010 from 16.24 million tons in \n2007. These initiatives include the GMA rice12 program, the FIELDS initiative,13 and the Rice \nSelf-Sufficiency  Plan  2009\u20132010.  Each  of  these  initiatives  recognizes  the  importance  of \nupgrading and expanding irrigation infrastructure to enable farmers to capitalize on the range of \nimproved agricultural technologies promoted through the programs. The Rice Self-Sufficiency \nPlan  proposes  a  combination  of  physical  upgrading  of  irrigation  systems  with  irrigation \nmanagement improvements and agricultural support services, including subsidies for hybrid \nseeds, geographic-specific interventions, and other technical assistance including training and \ntechnology demonstrations, and improved provision of market information. \n \n8.  NIA has been a leading advocate of IMT as a method to increase the participation of \nsystem users in the O&M of irrigation systems.14 However, although NIA has implemented a \nvariety of approaches to IMT, the issue of surplus staff continues to reduce NIA\u2019s capacity to \nreduce costs.15 The enactment of Executive Order 718 (8 April 2008) authorizing the NIA \nrationalization plan opens the way for NIA to streamline its organization. The rationalization plan \nwill be implemented after approval of a transition plan16 which sets out the number of irrigation \nsystems to be rehabilitated and transferred to implementing agencies annually over 5 years, \nand  the  personnel  to  be  affected  by  the  transfers.  The  proposed  World  Bank-funded \nParticipatory Irrigation Development Project (footnote 9) is to support implementation of the \nrationalization plan and similar investments in system upgrading for the proposed ADB project. \n \n9.  Rationale of the Irrigation System Operations Improvement Project. In response to \nthe current concerns about soaring prices of staple grains and the Government\u2019s initiative to \nachieve self-sufficiency in rice production by 2010, a review of the agriculture sector and the \nability of current policies to achieve sustainable food security is urgently needed. As the country \napproaches the end of the current MTPDP (footnote 6), a review of agriculture sector strategies \nand the role of irrigation in food security would help the Government enunciate a clear vision for \nsector development beyond the period targeted by the Rice Self-Sufficiency Plan and enable \nADB to prioritize future short- and medium-term operations in the sector.  \n \n10.  The project will contribute to the Government\u2019s MTPDP objectives of reducing rural \npoverty,  increasing  agricultural  productivity,  and  enhancing  food  security.  The  envisaged \n                                                 \n12  GMA is acronym of Ginintuang Masaganang Ani in local language which means \u201cgolden bountiful harvest.\u201d  \n13 FIELDS is the acronym for a program to support fertilizer, irrigation, education and training of farmers and fisherfolk, \nloans,  dryers  and  other  postharvest  facilities,  and  seeds  of  high-yielding,  hybrid  varieties  as  the  core  of  \nP43.7 billion (approximately $1.0 billion) in government support to agriculture. \n14 Communal irrigation systems are owned (after payment of amortization charges) and operated by users, with \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \ntechnical support from NIA and local government units. NIA holds national irrigation system assets on behalf of the \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nstate. IMT is intended to increase user participation in O&M, reducing NIA costs and enabling improvement in \nservice delivery.   \n15  Ofrecio, Bayani P. 2006.

The PPTA will \nassist the Government in undertaking a review of the agriculture sector to identify binding \nconstraints and opportunities to adjust ongoing programs to better focus efforts to ensure food \nsecurity in the medium to long term. Institutional and structural constraints that limit agriculture \nsector  performance  will  be  assessed  and  an  investment  project  formulated  to  increase \nagricultural production in selected irrigation systems.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the proposed investment project is increased farm household incomes \nand reduced rural poverty. The outcome of the PPTA will be the formulation of an investment \nproject  that  will  improve  agricultural  productivity  and  production  by  (i)  improving  irrigation \nservices and institutional arrangements that increase the role of water users in system O&M; \nand  (ii)  upgrading  rural  infrastructure,  including  irrigation  systems,  roads,  and  postharvest \nfacilities of selected irrigation systems in Mindanao and the Visayas.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The PPTA will be conducted in two phases: (i) agriculture sector and irrigation subsector \nanalysis, and (ii) investment project design. \n \n1.  Phase 1: Agriculture Sector and Irrigation Subsector Analysis  \n13.  The key activities will be to (i) identify, analyze, and prioritize binding constraints in the \nagriculture sector with a major focus on staple food production and food security, (ii) analyze \nsector policies and development strategies, (iii) conduct a diagnostic analysis of the constraints \non performance of irrigated agriculture and the role of irrigation in national food production, \n(iv) evaluate irrigation subsector development needs, and (v) prepare a sector road map. \n \n2.  Phase 2: Investment Project Design \n14.  This phase will formulate a sector-type investment project, including preparing and/or \nupdating feasibility studies for core subprojects, and completing compliance and safeguard \nrequirements and project packaging. Specific activities include (i) formulate subproject selection \ncriteria;  (ii)  undertake  participatory  subproject  identification  and  feasibility  studies  for  core \nsubprojects; (iii) identify candidate noncore subprojects, including potential for expansion of \nirrigated areas; (iv) prepare social and environmental safeguards and requisite action plans;  \n(v) formulate social development strategies and action programs for development of service \nareas and provision of agricultural support services; (vi) assess NIA implementation capacity \nand support requirements; and (vii) formulate project packaging for implementation. The initial \npoverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent. ADB will provide \n$1,000,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide the balance of local currency \ncost of $250,000 equivalent through the provision of experienced counterpart staff, office space, ", "  5 \ndata, administrative and clerical services, logistics, and communications support. Details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 3. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  NIA, under the guidance of the Department of Agriculture, will be the Executing Agency \nfor the PPTA, and will assign a project coordinator with the rank of a division manager at NIA \nheadquarters in Manila to oversee overall activities and to coordinate with other agencies. An \nadequate number of full-time engineers, a sociologist, and an environmental specialist will be \nassigned to assist the project coordinator and will serve as counterparts to the consultants. NIA \nwill form a PPTA coordination committee to facilitate interagency coordination and review the \nprogress and outputs of the PPTA. The committee will be chaired by the administrator of NIA, \nand will comprise senior representatives from the National Economic Development Authority, \nDepartment of Agriculture, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of \nPublic Works and Highways, and local government units concerned.  \n \n17.  Consulting services will be provided in two teams. The phase 1 team will comprise  \nan  international  agriculture  sector  policy  specialist  (1  person-month),  and  four  national \nconsultants (11.5 person-months) to provide expertise in agricultural economics, agricultural \npolicy analysis and sector reform, and irrigated agriculture performance analysis; and facilitate \nworkshops. The phase 2 team will require 13.0 person-months of international consulting and \n39.5  person-months  of  national  consulting.  The  international  expertise  will  include  a  rural \ndevelopment specialist as team leader; and specialists in the fields of agricultural economics, \nsociology, environment, and institutional development. The expertise of the national consultants \nwill include irrigation engineering, hydrology, institution building, agronomy, rural sociology, \nresettlement, database and geographic information systems, and workshop facilitation. The \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. ADB will engage the phase 1 consultants on an \nindividual basis. The phase 2 consultants will be engaged through a firm, or association of firms, \nbased on simplified technical proposals evaluated using the quality- and cost-based selection \n(80:20) method. ADB will engage all the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  procure  equipment  in \naccordance with its Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). NIA will \nretain all equipment upon PPTA completion. The PPTA will be implemented from October 2008 \nto September 2009. ADB will assist the Government in implementing the PPTA with regular \nreview missions with participation of staff of the ADB Philippines Country Office and NIA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Philippines  for  preparing  the  Irrigation  System  Operation  Efficiency \nImprovement Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and/or \nDesign  Performance Targets  Assumptions \nReporting \nSummary  and/or Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nUpgraded irrigation  An estimated 40,000 ha of  NIA project monitoring data  The Government seeks \nsystems and services that  irrigated command area  ADB funding for proposed \nrespond to stakeholders  benefit from upgraded  investment project \nneeds to increase  infrastructure and services \nagriculture production  by 2016 \n \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nAgreed project design for  The Government and ADB  The Government confirms  Political support for rural \nupgrading irrigation  make loan project effective  the memorandum of  infrastructure investment \nsystems and services that  by Q2 2010   understanding of final  remains strong \nrespond to stakeholders    tripartite review mission \nneeds to increase    and endorses PPTA final \nagricultural production and    report \nfulfill ADB design and   \nsafeguard requirements  \n \nOutputs      Assumption \nPhase 1       \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1. Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of \nthe partner country. \nContribution of the Sector or Subsector to Reduce Poverty in the Philippines. The project will be implemented in less \ndeveloped regions of the country, namely the Visayas and Mindanao. The poverty situation in the target area will be analyzed \nthrough the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA). The southern Philippines, especially Mindanao, lags the rest of \nthe country significantly in most development indicators according to the country poverty analysis.a  \n \nThe project will address poverty in rural areas and contribute to increased food security. The country poverty analysis shows \nthat most of the poor are dependent on agriculture, and poverty rates among farming households have remained above 50% \nsince 1985. The project will help increase agricultural production and farm household income through construction and \nmodernization of irrigation infrastructure, and improvement of the performance of irrigation systems.  \n \nLinkage with National Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Philippines does not have a national poverty reduction strategy; but \nfreedom from persistent, pervasive, and intense poverty is the cornerstone of the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan \n2004\u20132010. ADB and the Government signed a poverty partnership agreement in October 2001 identifying agriculture \nmodernization with social equity as one of four broad goals and/or strategies. The proposed project will address modernization \nof  irrigation  infrastructure  through  rehabilitation  of  the  irrigation  infrastructure  serving  some  30,000  hectares.  Irrigation \nmodernization is one component of the Government\u2019s Food Self-Sufficiency Plan 2009\u20132010, which aims to reduce the \ncountry\u2019s exposure to elevated staple food grain prices as experienced in 2008.  \n \nLinkage with ADB's Country Strategy And Program for the Philippines (2005\u20132007). The project will be implemented in \nparallel to a World Bank-financed project (Participatory Irrigation Development Project) expected to be implemented from 2007; \napplying the same IMT strategies and processes and working to increase harmonization of procurement procedures. The \ncountry strategy and programb notes that processing of the loan for the proposed ADB project will be conditional on clarification \nand confirmation of adequate budget allocation for the eventual loan project. \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)  Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nThe project will increase beneficiary farmers\u2019 household income and reduce poverty by increasing agricultural production \nthrough rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and improvement of performance of irrigation systems. Individual farm families \nwill obtain direct benefits from participation in the project and access to improved agricultural support services. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \nDetailed poverty and social analysis will be conducted during the PPTA. Full poverty and social analysis is proposed. The \nPPTA will look at the incidence of poverty using existing data sources and the social survey of potential beneficiaries. The \nanalysis will be carried out following ADB\u2019s Poverty Handbook 2006c and Handbook on Social Analysis.d Particular attention is \nto be given to profiling the beneficiaries, including gender disaggregated demographic, economic, and social data where \npossible, plus the incidence of poverty, vulnerable groups, and any adverse impacts anticipated from the Project. The proposed \nproject areas in Mindanao and the Visayas are less developed than other areas in the Philippines and rural poverty rates \nexceed those of urban areas. \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \nA rural development specialist and a rural sociologist will be mobilized during the PPTA. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n ", "  Appendix 2     9 \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \nImmediate primary beneficiaries will be farming households in the project schemes that will receive improved irrigation \nservices enabling increased agricultural production and increased incomes. Increased agricultural production of staple \ngrains, namely rice, will benefit the poor by reducing upward price pressures and reducing exposure to international rice \nmarkets.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nFarming households may require agricultural extension to capitalize fully on the improved irrigation services, in addition to \naccess to other support services such as extension, agricultural inputs, rural credit, and postharvest marketing. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \nInefficient irrigation services constrain farmers from fully benefiting from access to irrigation water. The project will \nimprove performance of irrigation services by rehabilitating the systems and strengthening NIA and the irrigators \nassociations for system operations. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \nPrimary stakeholders have been identified namely: \n(i) beneficiary farmers, (ii) irrigator associations, (iii) landholders who own the right-of-way of the related facilities, \n(iv) upstream and downstream water users such as domestic water and industry, (v) farmers who conduct slash-and-burn \nagriculture in the catchment forest area, (vi) nongovernment organizations in the area, and (vii) government line agencies \nand NIA. \n2. What type of consultation and participation is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, community \nmobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nWorkshops and community mobilization will be undertaken of core subprojects during the PPTA. For the noncore subprojects \nthese actions will be carried out during project implementation.    \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation        Collaborative decision making         Empowerment7 \n \n4.  Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?   Yes          No    Please explain. \nThe project is to be designed using participatory approaches. The PPTA consultants will provide a plan during the inception \nphase. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector8 that are likely to be relevant to this project or program?      \nWomen\u2019s access to information, participation in irrigation management institutions, and ability to protect their interests and \nimprove their livelihoods need to be improved.   \n \n2. Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?9       Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \n         The gender action plan will include various steps to enhance women\u2019s access to information, participation in irrigation \nmanagement institutions, and ability to protect their interests and improve their livelihoods.
