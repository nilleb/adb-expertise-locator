The Government of Solomon Islands has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto provide technical assistance (TA) for preparing the Domestic Maritime Support Project and \nTechnical Support Program. The Project was initially discussed with the Government during the \nCountry Programming Mission1 in June 2006, and was refined during the Fact-Finding Mission2 \nin February 2007 to assess the proposed project components. The findings of the Missions, in \nthe  form  of  a  draft  TA  paper,  have  been  discussed  with  the  Government.  ADB  and  the \nGovernment have reached an understanding on the goals, purpose, scope, implementation \narrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference.3 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The proposed TA was included in ADB\u2019s current country strategy and program update4 \nfor Solomon Islands, which supports the Government's strategic development plans.5 ADB\u2019s \ncountry assistance strategy aims to achieve rapid, pro-poor, rural-focused development and \neconomic growth led by the private sector by (i) providing transportation infrastructure and \nservices, and (ii) strengthening the enabling environment for private sector development. The \nproposed TA will directly support both objectives, and is consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy.6 \nIn recognition of ADB\u2019s long experience in implementing projects and TA in the transport sector \nin Solomon Islands, the Government requested, and other partners agreed, that ADB take the \nlead in implementing and coordinating aid to the transport sector.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Solomon Islands is one of the least developed among ADB\u2018s Pacific developing member \ncountries (PDMC). Measured by the most recent United Nations human development index and \nhuman poverty index, Solomon Islands ranks below all but one PDMC, and the country is \nunlikely  to  meet  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  by  2015.  Solomon  Islands  is  now \nrecovering from several years of conflict and faces a long period of recovery and rehabilitation \nof essential infrastructure and services that were destroyed or have become derelict due to lack \nof maintenance and regulation, and have not been rebuilt because of a lack of commercial \nopportunities. \n \n4.  The national economy relies on forestry, fisheries, and cocoa and copra production, all \ncarried out in the rural areas (Appendix 2). The vast majority of the rural population live on a \nsubsistence basis, and social and economic disparities between the capital Honiara and the \nprovinces  are  wide.  Successive  governments  have  not  succeeded  in  providing  adequate \ninfrastructure and services, especially in the rural areas, nor in facilitating private-sector income-\ngenerating opportunities outside Honiara.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Comprising W. Wicklein, Senior Private Sector Development Specialist, Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office \n(mission leader); and R.

Country Strategy and Program Update (2007\u20132009): Solomon Islands. Manila. Approved by ADB\u2019s \nBoard of Directors in September 2006. A country operations business plan for 2008\u20132010 is under preparation.  \n5  The Government\u2019s development strategy is based on the National Economic Recovery, Reform, and Development \nPlan 2003\u20132006, and the Policy Translation and Implementation document published in August 2006. The \nGovernment has initiated the formulation of a new development strategy. \n6  ADB. 2004. Responding to the Priorities of the Poor: A Pacific Strategy for the Asian Development Bank 2005\u2013\n2009. Manila. Approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in October 2004. \n ", "2   \n5.  Interisland transport between Solomon Islands\u2019 70 plus inhabited islands covers long \ndistances and is characterized by infrequent and unreliable schedules, and unsafe vessels. The \nmain mode of travel by sea is via small craft in coastal areas and combined passenger and \nfreight  vessels  for  interisland  movements.  Before  the  recent  civil  conflict,  formal  shipping \nservices called at about 125 small wharves and 86 anchorages, and irregular or chartered \nvessels reportedly called at over 400 locations. However, these services have deteriorated \nbecause of the economic downturn, and the number of usable wharves has decreased because \nof poor maintenance. At many locations, vessels cannot berth and passengers and cargo are \ncarried ashore in small craft, adding to the costs and threatening the security of passengers and \ncargo. Safety regulations are outdated, incomplete, and not enforced consistently due to both \nlegislative gaps and capacity constraints. Although major routes are commercially viable, others \nrequire some public sector support to provide social services. These limitations to transport \nservices pose considerable barriers to market access and are a disincentive to productive rural \nactivity. \n \n6.  With  respect  to  infrastructure,  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development  (MID)  is \nresponsible for all maintenance related to transport via land, sea, and air. However, the poor \ncondition of infrastructure has lowered travel speeds, increased fuel consumption, and raised \nvehicle and vessel operating costs and reduced their economic lives, thereby suppressing \ntransport demand. Outside Honiara, operator user costs are estimated to be 25% higher and \ntravel speeds are approximately half what they would be if the infrastructure was in good \ncondition.  Access  to  rural  areas  has  therefore  declined  severely  due  to  deterioration  and \nclosures, thus restricting the contribution of transport to economic growth, poverty reduction, \nand social development. Significant rehabilitation and maintenance projects funded by ADB and \nother development partners are under way, but local capacity to improve maintenance and \nsustain investments is still being developed.  \n \n7.  Major impediments to sustainable shipping in Solomon Islands include the absence of \nan effective government policy to promote shipping investment and safe operations, and poor \nmanagement of infrastructure assets. Given the local capacity constraints, it is important to \ncontinue building the capacity for analysis, asset management, community participation, and \nimplementation to support investment projects and prevent further loss of the capital stock. MID, \nwhich  includes  the  Marine  Division,  has  limited  capacity  to  plan  and  manage  the  needed \nactivities, and needs support to restructure and implement reforms to assert control of the \nplanning process and execute its regulatory responsibilities. \n \n8.  Related TAs7 provided since 2004 have: (i) established a National Transport Fund to \nenable subsidies to implement a franchise tender scheme and ensure a minimum level of \nservice on prioritized uneconomic routes; (ii) established a Transport Policy and Planning Unit \n(TPPU); (iii) improved the policy, regulatory, and legislative framework for interisland shipping; \nand (iv) provided training to private sector contractors and ship operators. Activities by other \ndevelopment partners include provision of rural wharves, ships, and navigation aids by the \nEuropean Commission (EC), Japan, and Taipei,China. Reforms must be consolidated, capacity \ndeveloped, and activities coordinated within the Government's processes for development and \nrecurrent budgets, regulation, and policy analysis.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004.

Impact and Outcomes \n9.  The impact of the TA will be increased efficiency, safety, and reliability in the transport \nsector, contributing to economic growth with improved distribution of benefits. Two outcomes \nare expected from this combined project preparatory and advisory TA. The outcome of the \nproject preparatory component will be consensus on the design of the proposed Domestic \nMaritime Support Project, programmed for 2008. The outcome of the advisory component will \nbe  improved  capacity  of  MID  to  plan,  finance,  and  manage  the  implementation  of \nrecommendations from  previous TA projects (footnote 7).  \n \n10.  Improved transportation infrastructure and services, which would give rural produce and \ncommodities  reliable  access  to  domestic  and  international  markets,  will  contribute  to  (i) \nrebuilding  rural  economies,  (ii)  fostering  private  sector  development  and  rural  income \nopportunities, (iii) reducing migration of people in search of employment, and (iv) restoring basic \nsocial services in rural areas to increase achievements in health and education. The focus on \nimproving accessibility of rural areas will enhance poverty reduction.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Preparing the Domestic Maritime Support Project \n11.  The project preparatory component will build on previous recommendations to improve \ninfrastructure and establish a franchise tendering scheme in support of interisland shipping. It \nwill  prepare  a  project,  for  approval  in  2008,  that  will  include  an  infrastructure  investment \ncomponent  and  an  institutional  development  component.  Infrastructure  investments  would \ninclude  construction  and/or  rehabilitation  of  provincial  wharves  and  jetties.  Institutional \ndevelopment would create a franchise tendering scheme for support of uneconomic routes, \nincluding support and capacity building for the National Transport Fund and its secretariat.  \n \n12.  Activities under the project preparatory component will include: (i) transport planning and \neconomics, preliminary engineering, and estimation of costs of potential investments; (ii) design \nof a franchise tendering scheme; (iii) drafting of procedures, regulations, and legislation; and (iv) \nconsultations with the Government, transport operators, and transport users.  \n \n13.  A long list of potential investments in rural wharves and jetties is available in the National \nTransport Plan adopted by the Cabinet in late 2006. The TA will refine this list based on \neconomic, social, and technical analyses to determine priority sites. The priority sites will be \nsubjected to detailed analysis to determine the justification for funding under the ensuing project.  \n \n14.  The  design  of  a  minimum-subsidy  franchise  tendering  scheme  will  follow  the \nrecommendations of previous TAs (footnote 7) and the outcomes of an EC-funded project for \ninterisland shipping that will support shipping on uneconomic routes during the second half of \n2007. Based on data on demand for and supply of services obtained through those initiatives, \nand on objective criteria for designating uneconomic routes and determining affordability to \nusers, mechanisms to operate a tender scheme through the National Transport Fund Board will \nbe designed and agreed upon, for possible funding through the ensuing project.  \n \n15.  Project preparation will also include designing an associated TA for establishing the \nSolomon  Islands  Maritime  Authority  to  facilitate  market  development  and  safety  oversight. \nInstitutional, legislative, and regulatory reforms are required to convert the Marine Division of \n ", "4   \nMID into an independent corporatized agency. Financial reforms are required to update and \nharmonize fees and licensing requirements to achieve financial self-sufficiency. Management \nand technical training is required to build the capacity of senior staff and inspectors to operate \ncommercially.  \n \n16.  Consultations with a wide range of stakeholders including transport operators, users, \nand relevant government agencies will be arranged through a project steering committee to \nensure broad support for reforms. The Government\u2019s Transport Task Force8 (TTF), which has \noversight responsibility for all modes of transport, will be kept informed to ensure coordination.  \n \n2.  Technical Support Program \n17.  The advisory component of the TA will strengthen the ability of MID and its TPPU for \nanalysis, asset management, community participation, and implementation. Activities under this \ncomponent will include: (i) developing an infrastructure asset management system; (ii) creating \na  technical  resource  center  to  support  MID\u2019s  planning  and  policy  functions;  (iii)  improving \nmaterials testing and quality assurance capability; and (iv) further institutional strengthening, \nincluding training for staff and private sector contractors.  \n \n18.  The development of MID\u2019s infrastructure asset management system will build on, and \nrefine, the Solomon Islands Transport National Information System that was initially established \nunder  ADB  TA  (footnote  7).  Technical  support,  training,  equipment,  and  assistance  with \noperational expenses are required to enable newly recruited MID staff to plan and conduct \ncondition surveys and accurately maintain the database.  \n \n19.  A technical resource center is urgently needed to facilitate access of MID staff and \nprivate  sector  contractors  to  current  specifications,  government  guidelines  and  manuals, \nbuilding codes, maps, aerial photos, and databases. Very little information is available in either \nelectronic or printed form in MID. The TA will permit the purchase, cataloging, and management \nof  technical  resources  to  support  MID\u2019s  role  as  a  planning  and  contracting  agency.  The \ntechnical resource center would be located within and managed by TPPU. \n \n20.  Improved capacity in materials testing and quality assurance are vital to enable MID to \nperform  its  contract  supervision  functions  and  facilitate  the  involvement  of  private  sector \ncontractors. The existing testing laboratory was almost completely destroyed during the civil \nconflict, leaving the Government to rely on either self-testing by contractors, which creates \ninherent  conflicts  of  interest,  or  on  overseas  laboratories,  which  are  expensive  and  time-\nconsuming. The TA will purchase some new testing equipment, allow renovation and calibration \nof existing equipment, and provide training in testing procedures.  \n \n21.  Further training for MID and TPPU staff and institutional strengthening are required in a \nnumber  of  areas  to  consolidate  MID\u2019s  developing  capacity  as  an  asset  management  and \ncontracting agency. These areas include (i) application of the new procurement guidelines and \nharmonization across development partners, (ii) capacity development in financial planning and \nmanagement, consistent with the recently upgraded national systems, (iii) transport planning \nand economics to enable TPPU to establish an effective role as secretariat to the National \nTransport Fund Board, and (iv) procurement practices and tender preparation for private sector \n                                                 \n8  The TTF is chaired by the permanent secretary of the Ministry of National Planning and Aid Coordination and \nincludes the permanent secretaries of MID, Provincial Development, and Finance and Treasury as members.  \nTPPU acts as the secretariat. The governments of Australia and New Zealand are also members by invitation of \nthe Government in recognition of their key role in the sector. \n ", "  5\ncontractors. A combination of training methods will be used to maximize exposure to best \npractices, including on-the-job training in MID and structured attachments to other public works \nagencies in the region to gain experience. A \u201ctwinning\u201d arrangement that was piloted in 2004\u2013\n2005 will be reassessed, adjusted, and supported to allow a more developed infrastructure \nagency from the region to act as an institutional mentor to MID. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The TA cost is estimated at $2,500,000 equivalent. Of this, $2,000,000 will be financed \non  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The \nGovernment of Solomon Islands will finance $500,000 equivalent through domestic resources. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the TA will be MID. A project steering committee will be \nestablished, chaired by the permanent secretary of MID, with membership drawn from relevant \nministries and private sector representatives. The committee will oversee detailed activities and \nwill report progress on a regular basis to the TTF to ensure coordination. The undersecretary of \nMID will be the TA coordinator. \n \n24.   The TA will be coordinated in cooperation with the Economic Reform Unit in the Ministry \nof Finance and Treasury, which has been formed to oversee, coordinate, and implement (i) \nregulatory reforms, (ii) a policy for infrastructure service provision and regulation, (iii) state-\nowned enterprise reform, (iv) financial sector reforms, (v) provincial economic development, (vi) \nstatistical  collection  service  reforms,  and  (viii)  specific  sector  policy  reforms  to  promote \ninvestment in potential growth areas.  \n \n25.   The TA will be closely coordinated with other initiatives by ADB and other development \npartners. They include the European Commission\u2019s Marine Infrastructure Project, ADB\u2019s Road \nImprovement  Project  and  Emergency  Assistance  Project,  and  Japan\u2019s  land  transport \ninvestments. Outputs from the TA will be disseminated through stakeholder consultations and \ninterim  reports  during  the  TA,  and  through  final  reports  at  its  completion  as  described  in \nSupplementary Appendix A (Outlines of the Final Reports). \n \n26.  The TA will require 48 person-months of international and 48 person-months of national \nconsulting services, utilized intermittently over 24 months as described in the outline terms of \nreference in Appendix 4. The TA will be concluded within 24 months, beginning in January 2008 \nand ending in December 2009. The consultants will be engaged by ADB using the quality-based \nselection  method,  following  submission  of  full  technical  proposals,  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Procurement of \nequipment, materials, and software will use the shopping method in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Upon  TA  completion,  the \nequipment will be handed over to MID. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n27.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Solomon \nIslands for preparing the Domestic Maritime Support Project and Technical Support Program. \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicatorsa  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  By 2010:    Assumptions \n       \nIncreased efficiency,  Maritime transport  Government statistics as  Government development \nsafety, and reliability in  services operate on  compiled in annual update  and transport sector \nthe transport sector,  more reliable routes  of National Transport Plan  priorities remain consistent. \ncontributing to  and schedules.     \neconomic growth with    MID work program  The Government maintains \nimproved distribution of  Access to provinces via    support for funding the NTF. \nbenefits   all transport modes is  National Economic   \nimproved.
