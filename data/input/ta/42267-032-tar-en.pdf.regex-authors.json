The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Government of \nRajasthan in its efforts to improve the quality of life of people and drive cultural economic growth \nby harnessing technology for urban planning, development, and management. Through the \napplication of smart technology in urban planning, the TA will support the state government in \nstrengthening urban planning by bringing various sectors and disciplines together in search of \nsynergy and developing integrated urban solutions that make better use of local resources and \nassets so that cities can thrive.  \n \n2.  The Government of India requested the TA, which is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan for India, 2021\u20132023 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The TA is aligned \nwith the guidance note on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and livable cities in Asia and the \nPacific.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Rajasthan is the largest state in India, with 10% of the country\u2019s land area. Rajasthan is \nthe seventh most populous state in India and home to 69 million people (5% of the country\u2019s \npopulation), 10 million of whom are poor. Since 2005, Rajasthan has made good progress in \nreducing poverty supported by fast growth in services\u2014mainly tourism\u2014and industry. However, \ngrowth  has  been  volatile  because  the  traditionally  strong  agriculture  sector  is  increasingly \nthreatened by severe water shortages that are aggravated by climate change.3 Tourism and \nmanufacturing demonstrate potential for alternative growth to agriculture and mining driven one. \nTherefore, the national and state governments have created initiatives to stimulate tourism and \nindustrial development and create jobs for migrants and local people. Tourism contributed 15% \nof the state economy. The 53.8 million tourists\u2019 arrivals in 2019 (including 1.6 million foreign \ntourists) were double the 2010 figure.4  \n \n4.  However, poor urban infrastructure and services have hampered the state\u2019s economic \ngrowth. Urban areas containing industry and tourism hubs occupy 25% of the state, and their \ncontinuous expansion has outpaced the state\u2019s ability to provide adequate infrastructure and \nquality  services  that  meet  the  basic  needs  of  residents  and  the  demands  of  the  growing \nmanufacturing and service industries. Compounding these unresolved urban challenges, COVID-\n19 hit the Rajasthan economy hard, especially tourism. Tourist arrivals dropped by 71% to 15.5 \nmillion (including 0.4 million foreign tourists) in 2020 (footnote 4), causing millions of job losses \nand wiping out many micro, small, and medium-sized businesses in tourism value chains.  \n \n5.  The state government is preparing for a rapid post-COVID-19 economic recovery by \nrevisiting pre-COVID development plans and prioritizing development and reform agendas. One \nsuch agenda is to implement and strengthen Rajasthan\u2019s strategic framework for Inclusive \nRevitalization of Historic Towns and Cities, promulgated in 2018 with support from the Cities \nAlliance, the National Institute of Urban Affairs, and the World Bank.5 The framework emphasizes \nenhancing urban planning and improving basic service provision and infrastructure development \nwhile strengthening heritage management systems to optimize the economic potential of the \n \n1  ADB. 2020.

Among the actions recommended in the framework\u2019s implementation \nplan is the building of an information and communication technology (ICT)-based platform to \nfacilitate urban and investment planning for quality urban infrastructure and services that is \nintegrated with heritage management. The state government has carried out basic social and \neconomic data for situation analysis, but no further actions have been taken in Jodhpur, the pilot \ncity, or Nawalgarh, the pilot town.  \n \n6.  The city of Jodhpur is located in central-west Rajasthan and has a population of about 1.2 \nmillion. Known as the \u201cBlue City\u201d because of the predominant indigo color of its buildings, Jodhpur \nretains much of its medieval character. Notable features include the famous Ghantaghar (clock \ntower) market; baori (stepwells), the ancient climate-resilient measures to mitigate drought; and \nlarge mansions, some of which have been converted into heritage hotels. The historic core of \nJodhpur suffers from traffic congestion and lack of basic infrastructure. The absence of proper \ncontrol  measures  on  the  use  of  heritage  assets,  including  buildings  with  historical  and/or \narchitectural  value  threatens  the  city\u2019s  rich  heritage,  including  its  historic  markets  and \nstreetscapes.  \n \n7.  The town of Nawalgarh, located in the northeast of the state, has a population of about \n100,000. Famous for its fresco and havelis (mansions), it is known as the \u201cGolden City\u201d of \nRajasthan. Temples and mansions decorated with frescos are densely concentrated in the old \ncity areas. Despite this cultural richness, Nawalgarh lacks adequate infrastructure and services. \nOther valuable heritage assets such as large baori and johad (ancient rainwater storage tanks) \nare in poor condition. Although Jodhpur and Nawalgarh differ in their level of urbanization, \ncomplexity,  scale,  and  the  condition  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  and  other \nsocioeconomic, environmental, and spatial dimensions, both areas lack holistic, systematic, and \nintegrated  urban  planning.  This  deficiency  has  become  a  hurdle  to  developing  adequate \ninfrastructure and services to address basic needs and capture the full value of their rich heritage \nto boost the cultural economy.  \n \n8.  The TA will support operational priority 4 of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: making cities more \nlivable. The three strategic pillars of this priority are to (i) improve coverage, quality, efficiency, \nand reliability of services in urban areas; (ii) strengthen urban planning and financial sustainability \nof cities; and (iii) improve urban environment, climate resilience, and disaster management of \ncities.6 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: livelihoods in cultural economies of Rajasthan \nsupported, sustained, and enhanced (footnote 5). The TA will have the following outcome: \nintegrated and heritage-sensitive urban planning and programming established in Jodhpur and \nNawalgarh. The outcome supports the state government\u2019s efforts to improve quality of life for all \nand unlock growth benefits by capturing the full value of cultural and historic assets.7  \n \n \n \n \n6 ADB. 2018.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output  1:  Information  and  communication  technology-based  urban  planning \nmapping tools for Jodhpur and Nawalgarh developed. Using geographic information systems \nand space-based technologies, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, the TA will \ndevelop smart urban planning mapping tools to visualize the results of situation analyses to \nfacilitate urban master planning and investment road maps in Jodhpur and Nawalgarh. The \nproject will carry out the analyses, which may include the following topics: urban land use, \nhydrogeology for rising groundwater levels, land subsidence, flood- and drought-prone zones, \ntransport networks, energy system bottlenecks, public services and facilities coverage, waste \nmanagement, air pollution, and building controls, including heritage buildings and other heritage \nassets.8 The selection of the focus areas for analyses would be determined with the consultation \nwith city governments. The artificial intelligence function of these smart urban planning platforms \nwill enable data updates, analyses, and simulations that can optimize adaptive urban planning \nand management. The platforms can be further expanded by linking and/or adding sector- and \ntheme-based data and information to address complex issues; seek synergetic solutions; and \nimprove  open,  transparent,  multidirectional  communication  among  stakeholders,  including \nauthorities, civil society organizations, and the public.9 \n \n11.  Output  2:  Feasibility  studies  for  priority  urban  investments  in  Jodhpur  and \nNawalgarh prepared. Based on the science- and knowledge-based urban planning supported \nby smart technologies, the TA will prepare feasibility studies for priority investments in Jodhpur \nand Nawalgarh. The selection of priority investments will consider whether measures address \nurgent basic needs, bring multifunctional benefits, and demonstrate transformative effects while \nstimulating behavior changes. Learning from the ancient climate-resilient measures, such as baori \nand johad, feasibility studies may include climate-resilient measures that are necessary to \naddress water scarcity and drought but are also of cultural, aesthetic, social, and/or environmental \nvalue to revitalize the urban environment. These solutions will help Jodhpur and Nawalgarh \nbecome more sustainable, inclusive, resilient, and livable by providing clean, safe, comfortable, \nand pleasant living environments that all residents and visitors can enjoy. The TA will conduct \nscoping activities to identify and suggest concept designs of priority measures and assess \nfinancial sustainability.10 \n \n12.  Output 3: Capacity of the state and urban local bodies for heritage-sensitive urban \nplanning, development, and management strengthened. The TA will actively engage public \nauthorities from the state government and urban local bodies (ULBs) in Jodhpur and Nawalgarh, \npossibly include other stakeholders like local civil society organizations and experts, and break \n \n8  Future Cities Laboratory, ETH Singapore SEC; Asian Development Bank. Bandung Smart Systems. Unpublished. \nSimilar smart systems were developed for Bandung, Indonesia under regional technical assistance for Establishing \nthe Future Cities Program in the Asia and Pacific Region (ADB. 2015. Establishing the Future Cities Programme in \nthe Asia and Pacific Region).  \n9  The Government of India promotes information and communication technology (ICT) application and deployment. \nMany states, including Rajasthan, emphasize the use of ICT to enhance e-governance and have built a state data \ncenter. The Government of Rajasthan is considered a pioneer in this area, establishing its data center in 2005 and \ncontinuing to expand ICT platform applications. In addition, several cities in Rajasthan were selected for Smart Cities \nMissions, a national program initiated by the Government of India to promote cities that provide core infrastructure \nand give their citizens a decent quality of life and a clean and sustainable environment through the application of \nsmart solutions. Cities such as Jaipur have developed digital infrastructure solutions, including Wi-Fi, environment \nsensors, smart parking, and smart lighting.  \n10  The priority measures identified under this TA are proposed to be implemented through additional financing for the \nADB-supported Rajasthan Secondary Towns Development Sector Project (ADB. India: Rajasthan Secondary Towns \nDevelopment Sector Project), which is expected to be approved in 2023. \n ", "4 \nthe siloed mentality and culture to establish participatory and integrated urban planning processes. \nThe TA will prepare and implement a capacity-building program for knowledge transfer and \ninstitutional strengthening to enhance (i) integrated and heritage-sensitive urban master planning; \n(ii) better use of smart urban planning tools; (iii) designing integrated multisector solutions for \nsynergetic and transformative urban development; and (iv) institutions and governance to enable \nmunicipal resource mobilization and financial sustainability of high-quality urban assets. The TA \nwill encourage the participation of women staff and elected representatives in such capacity \nbuilding activities. To ensure the replication of high-quality urban planning, development, and \nmanagement and unlock full growth potential of culturally rich cities and towns, the TA will also \ntrain other ULBs in Rajasthan. Capacity-building activities will include training, workshops and \nseminars, and/or site study visits. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $825,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (EAKPF) and administered by \nADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, data and information, and other in-kind \ncontributions. It will not finance civil works, procurement of large-scale equipment, permanent \nstaffing costs, or hiring of staff consultants. The TA will have an estimated climate mitigation cost \nof $28,000 and an adaptation cost of $35,000, which will be financed by the EAKPF. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.
