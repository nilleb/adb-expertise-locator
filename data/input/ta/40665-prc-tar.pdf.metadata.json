INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the 2006 Country Programming Review Mission, the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) confirmed the request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and \nManagement  Project.  Fact-finding  for  the  TA  was  undertaken  in  April  2007  and  an \nunderstanding was reached with the Government on the impact and outcome, scope, costs and \nfinancing, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Demand for urban infrastructure in the PRC is rising with increasing urbanization, and \nmore than half the population is expected to live in cities by 2030. The Government\u2019s 11th Five-\nYear Program (11th FYP), 2006\u20132010, focuses on continued urbanization and the development \nof large, medium-sized, and small cities and towns. Rapid urbanization in the PRC has taken a \nsevere toll on the environment, and has also challenged the capacity of local governments to \npromote good governance, effective planning and management, sustainable financing, and \ntimely delivery of public services. While significant progress has been made in building urban \ninfrastructure over the past two decades, such infrastructure tends to be concentrated in the \nmore highly developed eastern and southern coastal plains. The expansion and upgrading of \npublic services have not kept pace with rapid industrial growth. The rural migration to urban \ncenters currently taking place in the inland regions, in response to Government policies to \npromote economic development and job creation in those areas, is putting a further strain on \nurban infrastructure and services. \n \n3.  Cities  in  the  north  and  west  and  around  the  Songhua  River  basin  (SRB)  are \nexperiencing widespread pollution due to the discharge of untreated wastewater and improper \nmanagement of solid waste. Shortages of safe drinking water are also common, particularly in \nthe northern part of the PRC. The Government has classified more than 108 cities as having \nserious water problems, and 60 as being critically short of water. Municipal wastewater is a \nmajor contributor to the pollution of PRC\u2019s rivers and lakes, with the most severe pollution \nimpacts in the northern region of the country. Currently, only about 40% of urban wastewater in \nthe PRC is treated and the rest is discharged untreated into rivers and lakes. Further, the \ngrowing and uncontrolled disposal of solid waste contributes to increasing contamination of \ngroundwater supplies. Cities and towns in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces must overcome \nwidespread environmental degradation and meet increasing demands for public services to \nensure that their economic development is sustainable.   \n \n4.  The SRB is the third largest river basin in the PRC after the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. It \nhas an area of 557,000 square kilometers and a population of 62 million. Major cities such as \nChangchun, Harbin, Jiamusi, and Qiqihar are located in the SRB. Agriculture is well-developed \nand there is a large industrial base. The Songhua River catchment area covers portions of three \nprovinces: Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces and the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. \nChangchun is located in the upstream part of the Songhua River, which flows through Harbin. \nAfter  Harbin,  the  river  joins  the  Heilongjiang  River,  enters  the  Russian  Federation,  and \neventually discharges to the sea.  \n \n5.  The  SRB  is  seriously  polluted  and  is  acknowledged  by  the  State  Environmental \nProtection Administration (SEPA) as being one of the four most polluted river basins in the PRC. \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 April 2007.  ", "2   \nWater pollution issues in the SRB, especially in relation to the protection of drinking water \nresources for the municipality of Harbin, have received increased national and international \nattention due to a widely publicized pollution incident in the SRB in November\u2013December 2005. \nThe Songhua River is contaminated with a number of known and suspected trace organic \nchemicals, metals, and conventional pollutants. It is classified by the Government as Class IV2 \n(falling below Class V during the 6-month low flow winter season), and is considered unsuitable \nfor municipal domestic water use. In March 2003, ADB approved the Harbin Water Supply \nProject ($100 million)3 to address the needs of Harbin City (population 3 million) for clean and \nreliable drinking water from an alternative water source (Lalin River), since their existing source \nfrom the Songhua River was highly polluted. Because of the deteriorating water quality in the \nSonghua River, the Harbin municipal government expedited the construction of the Harbin \nWater Supply Project, which was completed 1 year ahead of the original schedule. \n \n6.  During  the processing of  the  Harbin  Water  Supply  Project,  extensive  dialogue was \nconducted with the Government on addressing pollution control in the SRB. Consequently, in \n2002,  ADB  provided  a  TA  for  the  Songhua  River  Water  Quality  and  Pollution  Control \nManagement.4  The  TA,  which  was  considered  highly  successful,5  (i)  addressed  technical \nknowledge gaps, (ii) strengthened the capacity of the Songhua Water Resources Protection \nBureau, and (iii) assisted the Government in developing a long-term water pollution control plan \nfor the SRB beyond 2010. The TA provided strategic policy inputs to the 11th FYP and the SRB \nWater Pollution Prevention and Control Plan (SRBPCP).  \n \n7.  The  Government  is  paying  increasing  attention  to  water  resources  management, \nwastewater treatment and pollution control, and the formulation of investment plans to address \nwater supply shortages and wastewater treatment. The SRBPCP (2006\u20132010), approved in \nprinciple by the State Council on 29 March 2006, is an action program to set pollution control \ntargets from 2006 to 2010, requiring that urban environmental pollution and ecological damage \nbe controlled by 2010. Large and medium-sized cities\u2019 wastewater treatment rate should not be \nless than 70% by 2010. \n \n8.  The Jilin Water Supply and Sewerage Development Project ($100 million),6 approved in \n2005, was the first major ADB investment directly addressing pollution control in the SRB. The \nproposed  Jilin  Urban  Environmental  Improvement  Project  ($100  million),  currently  being \nprocessed for approval in 2007, is the second, and follows the priority list of the SRBPCP. The \nproposed project with an indicative ADB loan of $200 million will be the third major ADB \ninvestment in the SRB, and also follows the priority list of the SRBPCP. This comprehensive \nstrategic approach to addressing pollution control in the SRB will serve as a good model for \nreplication elsewhere in the PRC. \n \n9.  The proposed project municipalities are Baishan, Changbaishan, Changchun, Huinan, \nJilin,  and  Tonghua  in  Jilin  Province;  and  Harbin,  Heihe,  Jiamusi,  Qiqihar,  Qitaihe,  and \n                                                 \n2   PRC water quality standards have five classes covering about 40 pollution parameters. Class I is pristine, while \nclass V is suitable only for industrial use.  \n3  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "  3\nShuangyanshan in Heilongjiang Province. Heilongjiang has identified 14 subprojects focusing \non wastewater treatment and water supply. Jilin has identified 15 subprojects focusing on water \nsupply, wastewater treatment, solid waste management, and river improvement. Sector and \nproject  lending  were  thoroughly  discussed  and  considered  as  alternative  approaches.  The \nGovernment  expressed  its  strong  preference  for  the  project  lending  approach  because  all \nsubprojects  have  been  identified  and  feasibility  study  reports  have  been  prepared.  All \ncomponents  of  the  proposed  project  have  one  common  impact,  to  improve  the  urban \nenvironment and enhance the quality of life in the above cities and contribute to pollution control \nin the SRB.  \n \n10.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  water  policy7  and  will  help  the  PRC  achieve \nMillennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  7,  target  10,  which  establishes  the  2015  target  of \nreducing by 50% the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and \nimproved sanitation. The project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s strategic objectives in the PRC to \nmake  markets  work  more  efficiently  through  infrastructure  development  and  to  promote \nenvironmental  sustainability.  Over  the  past  decade,  ADB  has  significantly  increased  its \ninvolvement in urban development and water resource management in the PRC through its \nlending and TA operations. The experience gained from similar projects in Changchun, Fuzhou, \nHarbin,  Hefei,  Nanjing,  Shandong,  Shanghai,  Tianjin,  Wenzhou,  and  Wuhan  has  been \nconsidered in the design of the proposed TA. Given the large financing needs of pollution \ncontrol in the SRB, during TA implementation innovative options for attracting private sector \nparticipation will be explored and discussed, including the public\u2013private participation model \ndeveloped  under  the  Nanjing  Qinhuai  River  Environmental  Improvement  Project.8  The \nenvironmental  aspects  of  the  ensuing  project  will  be  assessed  comprehensively,  including \ninnovative approaches to addressing environmental issues.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The expected impact of the TA is an improved urban environment and enhanced quality \nof life in the municipalities of Baishan, Changbaishan, Changchun, Huinan, Jilin, and Tonghua, \nin  Jilin  Province;  and  Harbin,  Heihe,  Jiamusi,  Qiqihar,  Qitaihe,  and  Shuangyanshan  in \nHeilongjiang Province. The expected outcome is the agreed-upon design of the SRB Water \nPollution  Control  and  Management  Project.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1, and the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will (i) evaluate the project in the context of strategic long-term development \nplans, the 11th FYP, the SRBPCP, alternative strategies for wastewater management, water \nsupply  capacity  development,  and  solid  waste  management,  to  meet  the  project  cities\u2019 \nincreasing demand; (ii) identify sector investment priorities in each city; (iii) review and assess \nthe feasibility of the selected subprojects based on technical, institutional, environmental, social, \neconomic, and financial assessments; (iv) develop an institutional strengthening component, \nbased on a needs assessment for the implementing agencies (IAs) of the subprojects in each \ncity; and (v) design a corporate development plan for the IAs, based on a financial management \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2001.

Manila.     ", "4   \nassessment. Household surveys will be conducted to address issues of public awareness and \npreference, willingness to pay, and affordability. The TA will identify stakeholders and develop a \nparticipatory strategy for project preparation, design, construction, and operation. Consultation \nworkshops and tripartite meetings will be scheduled strategically during the implementation of \nthe TA.  \n \n13.  The  major  assumptions  and  risks  that  need  to  be  considered  for  successful  TA \nimplementation  include  (i)  inadequate  counterpart  support  and  performance,  (ii)  lack  of \nadequate and timely provision of necessary data, (iii) delay in submitting required studies, (iv) \ndelays  in  appointing  and  mobilizing  consultants,  and  (v)  inadequate  performance  of  the \nconsultants. The Government has agreed to provide sufficient counterpart support, to provide all \nnecessary data when required, and to undertake and update all required studies according to a \ntimetable agreed on with ADB. Efforts will be made to ensure that consultants are recruited on \ntime and that their performance is closely monitored and reviewed. Close coordination among \nADB,  the  executing  agencies  (EAs)  and  IAs,  and  the  consultants  will  further  mitigate  the \npotential risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,700,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $1,300,000 equivalent.9 The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  ($1,104,000)  and  the  Cooperation  Fund  for  the  Water  Sector \n($196,000). The Government has agreed to provide the balance of $400,000 in kind to cover \ncounterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative support services, and local transport and \nlogistics. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government \nhas been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance the ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  A project steering committee will be established at the central Government level to \ncoordinate project activities in Heilongjiang and Jilin. The Heilongjiang provincial government \n(HPG) will be the EA for the Heilongjiang component, and the Jilin provincial government (JPG) \nwill be the EA for the Jilin component.  A vice governor will chair the provincial-level TA steering \ncommittee  in  each  province,  with  members  from  the  respective  development  and  reform \ncommissions,  and  bureaus  of  construction,  finance,  environment  protection,  and  water \nresources.  \n \n16.  The TA offices in Heilongjiang and Jilin will be headed by the vice directors of the \ndevelopment and reform commissions, and will include staff from the abovementioned bureaus \nto ensure consultants\u2019 access to relevant project information and data, and to liaise with ADB on \nmatters relating to TA implementation. HPG and JPG have agreed to provide 10 experienced \nand qualified counterpart staff each to work with the consultants on a full-time basis. Prior to the \nstart of TA implementation, the concerned municipal governments in Heilongjiang and Jilin will \nestablish similar organization structures, chaired by their respective vice mayors, to implement \nthe TA. HPG and JPG will provide the consultants with a suitably furnished office with utilities, \ntelecommunication access, materials, maps, data, and all required project documents.  \n \n                                                 \n9 The TA budget will be $650,000 for Heilongjiang, and $650,000 for Jilin. Cost tables for Jilin and Heilongjiang \ncomponents have been prepared separately.   \n ", "  5\n17.  The TA will be implemented over a 6-month period. It is expected to start in January \n2008 and be completed by July 2008. Total consultants\u2019 inputs are estimated at 90 person-\nmonths, 34 international and 56 national.10 The consultants will be engaged through a firm in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). ADB will select and engage consultants on the basis of the quality of the proposal (90%) \nand the cost (10%) of the services to be provided (the quality- and cost-based selection method) \nusing the full technical proposal procedures. The 90:10 weighting is considered appropriate \nbecause the TA is a complex multidisciplinary assignment involving two provinces that requires \ninnovation and creativity, and the quality of the consulting services will have a high impact on \nthe ensuing loan. The TA will be conducted by a separate team for each province. The TA will \nhave one project team leader11 who will be responsible for coordinating the work among the two \nseparate teams of consultants and establishing synergies, particularly in terms of demonstration \neffects  and  innovativeness  among  the  two  provinces;  and  two  teams  of  international  and \nnational consultants who will be stationed in the two provinces, respectively, to implement the \nTA. The consultants will have expertise in water supply, wastewater treatment, domestic solid \nwaste  management,  river  hydrology  and  flood  control,  financial  and  economic  analyses, \ninstitutional and regulatory development, social analysis, resettlement, and environment. The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. TA equipment will be procured \nby the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time), and will be retained by the EAs upon completion of the TA.   \n \n18.  The consultants will submit to ADB and HPG and JPG, in English and in Chinese, the \ninception, interim, draft final, and final reports; the summary environmental impact assessment \nreport; and an English translation of the Government\u2019s resettlement plan and its summary. The \nconsultants will maintain close working relations with ADB, HPG, and JPG, and will regularly \ndiscuss progress and findings. Tripartite meetings involving ADB staff, the consultants, and \nHPG and JPG will be held in Harbin and Changchun cities, respectively, to provide guidance to \nthe consultants and to review their reports. Study findings on the project objectives and scope, \ncomponents, cost and financing plan, implementation arrangements, and main issues will be \npresented in three workshops.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $196,000 to be financed on a grant basis \nby the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $1,104,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina for preparing the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management Project. \n                                                 \n10  17 person-months international consultants and 28 person-months national consultants, each for Jilin Province \nand Heilongjiang Province, respectively. \n11  The team leader will be in the field for 6 person-months.

Introduction \n \n1.  The assignment is to prepare an investment project suitable for Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  financing.  The  project  will  help  the  selected  subproject  cities,  municipalities, \ncounties, and townships in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces improve their urban environments \nand  achieve  long-term  sustainable  development  through  investments  in  (i)  water  supply \ntreatment  and  distribution,  (ii)  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  (iii)  solid  waste \nmanagement, and (iv) river water treatment.   \n \n2.  The final output of the consultants is a report and associated appendixes, prepared in \naccordance with the policies and guidelines of ADB, which will serve as the basis for formulating \nan investment project to improve the urban infrastructure and environment of the concerned \ncities, municipalities, counties, and townships in Heilongjiang and Jilin. The terms of reference \nfor the consultants are described in the following sections. \n \nB.  Overview of Requirements \n \n1.  Review  of  Subproject  Cities  Comprehensive  Urban  and  Specific  Sector \nDevelopment Plans \n \n3.  The  consultants  will  review  the  comprehensive  urban  development  plan  of  the \nsubproject cities, particularly with regard to the cities\u2019 overall strategies for sustainable growth \nand development. They will also evaluate relevant municipal sector development plans and \nprograms  pertaining  to  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  solid  waste  management, \nintegrated water resources management, river basin management, and water resources and \nregional watershed; and higher-level planning documents for the Songhua River basin (SRB), \nYalu and Tumen river basins, including proposed activities for controlling pollution in the SRB in \nthe 11th Five-Year Plan. \n \n4.  Following  the  review,  programs  and  projects  aimed  at  improving  the  urban \nenvironment and quality of life in the subproject cities in Heilongjiang and Jilin will be identified \nand assessed in terms of their relative importance and in the context of the proposed project. \nFor additional information, the consultants can also refer to the relevant reports on ongoing \nLoan  2175-PRC:  Jilin  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Development  Project  and  associated \ntechnical assistance (TA) reports on the completed TA 4061-PRC: Songhua River Water Quality \nand Pollution Control Management and TA 4804-PRC: Jilin Urban Infrastructure Project, and \nthe proposed Jilin Urban Environmental Improvement Project.  \n \n5.  On the basis of the review of these plans and background materials, the consultants \nwill  carry  out  a  situation  analysis  of  the  urban  environment  improvement  program  of  the \nsubproject  cities  to  ensure  that  least-cost  options  have  been  considered  in  selecting  the \nsubprojects. The situation analysis will also serve as the basis for recommending a strategic \npolicy and program improvements for the subproject cities to achieve sustainable development \nthrough the implementation of the various sector plans (e.g., wastewater master plan, water \nsupply master plan, solid waste management plan) relevant to the project. In evaluating the \nselected subprojects in the context of these plans, the consultants will undertake technical, \nenvironmental,  social,  financial,  economic,  and  institutional  studies  following  relevant  ADB \nguidelines. Additional subprojects may be identified or proposed for possible inclusion in the \nproject during the inception phase of the TA, and subprojects may be changed or dropped. The \n ", "  Appendix 4   15 \nconsultants should identify other externally assisted projects dealing with public infrastructure or \nthe environment and those that have been proposed for funding by other external agencies, with \nthe view of promoting coordination with such agencies.  \n \n  2.  Policy Discussion and Related Activities \n \n6.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and ADB have closely collaborated on several \npolicy-oriented  studies  and  investment  projects  aimed  at  promoting  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment and environmental protection. This partnership has grown substantially and is \nexpected to continue as urbanization accelerates in the PRC. To strengthen the policy content \nof the project, the consultants will prepare notes on such policy issues as (i) water, wastewater, \nand solid waste cost recovery and tariff reform; (ii) corporate governance and enterprise reform; \n(iii)  integrated  water  resources  management  and  water  conservation;  (iv)  environmental \nregulatory enforcement and monitoring; (v) private sector participation; and (vi) urban poverty \nreduction and social protection. The consultants will review material prepared under related \nTAs.1   \n \n  3.  Review of Domestic Feasibility Studies \n \n7.  The consultants will review domestic project proposals, feasibility studies, environmental \nassessments, resettlement plans (RP) for the subprojects, and other related reports used to \nsubstantiate the analyses of the feasibility studies.  \n \n8.  The  findings  of  the  domestic  feasibility  study  reports  (FSRs)  will  be  confirmed,  as \nrequired, on the basis of the consultants\u2019 review involving the following points:  \n \n(i)  Review  of  the  preliminary  design,  including  cost  estimates  and  civil  works \npackages and project implementation schedules. \n(ii)  Assessment to determine whether identified subproject alternatives adequately \nrepresent possible options including, as appropriate, alternative facility routes \nand  sites,  alternative  levels  of  capacity  development,  alternative  process \ntechnologies, alternative facility designs, alternative management policies and \npractices, etc.. \n(iii)  Confirmation that the proposed subproject (a) is a defensible least-cost option, \n(b) is compliant with environmental and social requirements, and (c) will meet \nspecified goals and objectives. \n(iv)  Based  on  the  review,  the  consultant  will  provide  guidance  and  support  to \nresponsible specialists in finalizing the FSRs in line with ADB\u2018s policies and \nguidelines. Where details are lacking or analyses are inadequate, the consultants \nwill collaborate with the reports\u2019 authors to make the necessary changes so as to \nsatisfy  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  appraising  projects.  In  this  collaboration,  the \ndomestic  authors  will  assume  primary  responsibility  for  providing  missing \ninformation, including information describing project alternatives for the least-cost \nanalysis.  The  domestic  authors  will  also  assume  primary  responsibility  for \nrevisions and new analyses.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000.
