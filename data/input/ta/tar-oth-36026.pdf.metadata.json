INTRODUCTION \n1.  The overall goal of the proposed technical assistance (TA) is to promote viable and \nsustainable rural financial systems in the Central Asian republics (CARs). This goal will be \nachieved by developing approaches and modalities for efficient intermediation of rural financial \nresources specifically by (i) diagnosing the current state of rural financial systems, identifying \nconstraints and issues and potential approaches and institutional mechanisms for delivering \nfinancial services; (ii) examining approaches through which the banking system can deliver \nservices more effectively, while considering viable, alternative institutional mechanisms that \nhave  served  well  in  other  countries;  and  (iii)  discussing  approaches,  modalities  and  best \npractices for efficient intermediation in delivering rural financial services at the international, \nnational, and regional levels. The TA will bring together rural finance experts and market \nparticipants, as well as other stakeholders, to encourage the debate on issues facing rural \nfinancial systems, as well as disseminate recommendations.  The TA will draw on the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB\u2019s) and other aid agencies' existing policy and country work in rural \nfinancial markets. The TA1 framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since  1991,  the  newly  market-oriented  financial  systems  in  CARs  have  been \npreoccupied with laying the basic foundations of a commercial banking system.  CARs have \nseen  a  great  deal  of  bank  insolvency  and  restructuring  due  to  excessive  exposure  to \nirresponsible state lending and poor regulations and governance. Initially in the transition period, \ngovernments used the banking systems to continue financial support for agricultural and other \ntargeted enterprises, without regard to the financial consequences on the banks involved. As a \nresult, the banking system, including the state-owned agricultural banks, ended up burdened \nwith an excessive amount of nonperforming loans. As most of these institutions were shut down \nacross the region, bank lending to purely agricultural enterprises has come to a virtual halt.   \n \n3.  The financial sectors of CARs2 have now stabilized, yet remain underdeveloped.  Critical \nsectors of the economy have only limited access to formal financial services.  For instance, the \nfinancial system underserves the rural sector that employs from 34-53% of CARs' populations, \nwith agricultural production contributing from 9% to 72% of gross domestic product (Appendix 2 \nshows key indicators for the rural/agricultural sectors for all CARs).  In the transition, the CARs \nhave (i) dismantled rigid, state-controlled systems of agricultural production; (ii) encouraged \nsubstantial  and  growing  participation  of  private  farmers,  herders,  and  households;  and \n(iii) subsidized directed credit to rural and agriculture systems as well as small and medium \nenterprises (SMEs) and the micro and small enterprises (MSEs) through special state-driven \nprograms.     \n \n4.  The CARs have launched several initiatives to provide credit to the rural and agriculture \nsectors as well as to SMEs and MSEs. Evidence suggests that the poorest segment of the rural \nand agriculture sectors remains predominantly underserved by both the banks and alternate \nmechanisms that are either ineffective or at a rudimentary stage of development.  Varied issues \nand constraints face the rural financial market intermediation process. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities  in August 2002. \n2  Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. ", "2 \n5.  Status of Alternate Channels of Delivery. In CARs, financial intermediation related to \nrural and agriculture sectors takes place through the banking system. The cost of credit remains \nhigh due in large part to operational inefficiencies and poor governance of financial institutions.  \nBanks have either channeled, directed subsidized credit or rediscounted money targeted to \nagriculture or SMEs, mainly funded by aid agencies. None of these initiatives represents a \nsustainable funding mechanism. Bankers, on their own account, are reluctant to reach out \nbeyond the larger corporate customers in the largest cities and leave poorer, rural clientele \nwithout access to banking services.  Furthermore, banks are not equipped to deal with the \nnatural  risk  of  lending  to  primarily  agricultural  enterprises.  Capacity  building  in  credit/risk \nmanagement, product design and pricing, and marketing remains an acute need. \n \n6.  CAR rural enterprises are in many cases organized around households or otherwise fall \ninto the category of MSE or SME. Rural households are often engaged in a combination of \nagricultural  and  nonagricultural  income-generating  activities,  that  when  evaluated  together, \nprovide a bankable mix of cash flow sources. Rural microfinance institutions (MFIs), therefore, \nhave a key role to play in providing services. In other parts of developing Asia and in Latin \nAmerica, MFIs have often been provided unsecured or semi-secured retail credit by banks, with \nsome degree of success.  The challenge for CARs\u2019 commercial banks is to create the right mix \nof products and services for the new rural MSEs and SMEs, delivered through the right \norganization structure and channels and administered by an effective governance regime.       \n  \n7.  Many nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have ventured into rural areas, but these \ninstitutions often have a problematic ownership structure and mixed set of missions, some \npurely social. There are interesting lending programs in every CAR.  Most of the programs will \nhave difficulty transforming themselves into sustainable, full-service financial institutions. Yet \nthey are filling a need for credit in underserved rural areas. Approaches ought to be developed \nto ensure the sustainability of this channel of financing, drawing on the experience of the best-\nrun programs that have been or will be transformed into formal financial institution, and which \ncan offer a meaningful level of services in rural areas (e.g., XAC Fund, now XAC Bank in \nMongolia).   \n \n8.  Small financial institutions (SFIs), like savings and credit unions (SCUs), can play a vital \nrole in filling the rural financial service vacuum.  ADB's recent experiences in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Mongolia show that SCUs are popular, but require substantial and prolonged TA \nprogramming, including social intermediation, to ensure that both the SCUs and their support \nsystems are set up and operate properly. Still, decades of experience with SCUs in Latin \nAmerica  and  more  recent  experience  in  Asia  demonstrate  that  if  run  on  clear  business \nprinciples, SCUs can achieve considerable outreach3 and serve the economically active poor.  \n \n9.  The development of rural financial markets can be catalyzed by promoting new and \ninnovative financial products that have served other markets well. These products include \ninsurance and reinsurance, which deal with natural and other kinds of risk, and equipment \nleasing.  These  products  and  businesses  require  the  adoption  of  a  conducive  legal  and \nregulatory framework; the financial institutions themselves require capacity building so as to \nmanage the new and different kinds of risk.   \n \n                                                 \n3  In 2000, the amount of credit provided by savings and credit unions in Latin America reached $2 billion, compared \nwith $800 million provided by microfinance institutions.

On the policy side, one major constraint to the \ndevelopment of rural finance is lack of an explicit framework for financial sector development \nthat considers at all times the needs of the rural economy and rural population. One constraint is \nthe lack of laws governing insurance, which renders the CARs, each with a large agriculture \nsector, fully exposed to natural risk.  As for the regulatory side, capacity building remains the \nmajor challenge.   \n \n11.  In many CARs, the legal and regulatory approach is to draft laws specifically for MFIs on \none hand, and SCUs on  the other, and to consider regulation needs separately for each.  \nCommercial banking laws and regulations, for better or for worse, are considered separately \nfrom those that govern SFIs.  In most CARs, regulations governing the operations of SFIs are \ninadequate, and resources and capacity to effectively regulate SFIs are insufficient.   \n \n12.  Mindful of the system and moral hazard risks and given many bank failures and the low \nlevel of public trust in banks, regulators are reluctant to allow deposit taking by SFIs. The \nconcern with system risk is understandable, but it impedes mobilization of deposits.  SFIs tend, \ntherefore,  to  overemphasize  their  only  product,  credit,  when  rural  dwellers  have  a  more \nfundamental need for deposit and payment services.  Even though limited amounts of credit are \navailable in rural areas, no real financial intermediation is taking place. Aside from deposit \ninsurance, which was recently introduced in Kazakhstan, CAR regulators have few strategies for \nincreasing the level of deposits.   \n \n13.  Role of the Central Bank and Government. Central banks often play two roles. The \nfirst and essential role is that of guardian of the public\u2019s trust in financial institutions that are \nclassified as deposit-taking institutions, which the central bank regulates and supervises. The \nother role is that of promoter of new kinds of financial institutions.  Given their lack of skills, often \nregulators in CARs struggle to play the former role effectively. To date, governments and central \nbanks have received a great deal of policy advice and technical support from the aid community \nin  developing  of  SFIs.  Though  most  of  this  advice  is  well-intentioned,  it  has  often  been \nuncoordinated and delivered ineffectively.  The aid agencies' record notwithstanding, it is clearly \nthe responsibility of CAR governments and central banks to develop their financial sectors to \nserve the needs of urban and rural dwellers, SMEs as well as and micro entrepreneurs. CAR \npolicymakers have received advice and expertise  but the challenge is to sift through the \ninformation, determine what has worked and why, and design coherent long-term strategies that \nare politically supportable. \n \n14.  Corporate governance remains weak, with managers relatively free to operate without \ndue  regard  for  acceptable  risk,  efficiency,  or  profitability  benchmarks.  In  more  developed \ncountries, the public debt and equity markets serve to impose discipline on managers even \nwhen board members do not act decisively. In CARs, with market discipline entirely absent and \nboards of directors unassertive or otherwise unprepared, regulators become the only effective \ncheck on management.  Regulators rarely act until an institution has failed or is on the brink of \nfailure.  In  the  absence  of  fully  functioning  market  mechanisms,  governments  and  the  aid \nagencies that support them have a responsibility to vigorously promote principles of operational \nefficiency, good corporate governance, and transparency. \n \n15.  The proposed TA aims to review and analyze in depth the current state of rural financial \nmarkets in CARs, focusing on issues related to meeting the requirements of micro and small \nborrowers.  The findings will be compared with approaches and modalities that have resulted in \nimproved rural financial services in other parts of the world. The TA will outline frameworks for \nexpanding the range of financial services and giving greater access to those services to as ", "4 \nbroad a spectrum of rural society as possible in CARs. Within CARs, rural financial markets are \ndeveloping  more  rapidly  in  some  countries  (Kazakhstan  and  Mongolia)  than  in  others \n(Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan), and experiences in the former may give \nuseful lessons, that can be applied in the latter. ADB's past TA programs at the regional level \nhave  been  prescriptive  and  produced  general  recommendations  for  national-level \nprogramming.4 The national TA programs have primarily supported individual components, \nincluding the promotion of SCUs, village cooperatives, or NGOs engaged in microfinance. The \nTA will draw on both ADB and other aid agency activities and programs to evaluate the \neffectiveness of external interventions to date, and to determine next steps that are geared to \nbuilding sustainable financial institutions that serve the needs of the rural people in CAR. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n16.  The goal of the TA is to promote the development of sound and viable rural financial \nmarkets to make improved financial services widely accessible to rural micro entrepreneurs and \nSMEs. The TA will support a regional study that will give a comprehensive overview and \nanalysis of the size and structure of rural financial activity in each CAR and related issues. \nConsidering local requirements and conditions, the TA will give advice on efficient alternate \napproaches and modalities for developing sustainable rural financial systems that serve the \nrequirements of small and micro borrowers. The TA findings and recommendations will be \ndiscussed at national and regional levels.  \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n17.  The TA will \n \n(i)  carry out diagnostic studies of the current state of rural financial systems for the \nsix targeted CARs, which will identify constraints and issues in the delivery of \nfinancial  services.  The  review  will  examine  rural  financial  markets  from  the \nperspectives  of  the  customer/beneficiary,  product,  institution-regulatory \nframework, and policy; will define, measure, and evaluate the full spectrum of \nfinancial  activity\u2014from  formal  to  informal\u2014including  the  role  of  commercial \nbanks, SCUs, NGOs, and other nonbank financial institutions;   \n(ii)  examine ways to use the banking system for more effective service delivery, \nwhile considering viable, alternative institutional mechanisms that have served \nwell in other countries;  \n(iii)  identify specific subsector needs for financial services through case studies of \nrural finance customers (and potential customers). \n(iv)  catalogue aid agency assistance and evaluate its impact on rural finance; \n(v)  draw on international, regional, and national best practices in rural financial \nservice delivery to help each CAR to promote the building of strong, sustainable \nrural financial service providers; and  \n(vi)  support dialogue with key stakeholders in each country. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2000.

", "    5 \n18.  A team of international and domestic consultants will conduct an intensive research into \nthe rural financial systems in each CAR at national and regional levels. The result will be six \nnational diagnostic studies, which will be collated to provide a regional overview.  The findings \nwill be discussed in national workshops to include key stakeholders, with workshop insights \nincorporated into the final drafts of the studies.  The set of national studies will be the basis for a \nregionwide analysis of rural financial systems. Selected participants in the national workshops \nwill be invited to participate in a regional workshop, the purpose of which is to arrive at \nconclusions and recommendations for either national or regional projects to promote rural \nfinance.   \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The estimated cost of the TA is $600,000, composed entirely of foreign exchange.  The \nTA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program.  Detailed cost estimates and \nthe financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The ECGF will implement the TA, with logistical support from ADB\u2019s Resident Missions \nin the CARs; ADB will be the executing agency.  The Missions, as well as government agencies \nwith which ADB maintains close contacts in the CARs, will be asked to help coordinate national \nworkshops and the final regional workshop.  ADB will review and monitor the implementation of \nthe TA through regular missions and consultant\u2019s reports.  ADB will organize and participate in \nthe national workshops and the final regional workshop.   \n \n21.  A team of 17 consultants will be recruited to implement the TA. Five international \nconsultants (16 person-months) will coordinate the work of the domestic consultants (36 person-\nmonths). The international consultants will be led by a rural financial systems advisor/team \nleader (8 person-months), supported by four rural finance country specialists (2 person-months \neach).  Twelve domestic consultants will be fielded, two from each of the six CARs, for 3 months \neach.  The domestic consultants will have a background in economics, finance, and/or banking. \nAll consultants will be selected and recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Outline  terms  of \nreference for the international and domestic consultants are in Appendix 4.  The TA is expected \nto start in January 2003 and to be completed in December 2003. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under  the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis for \nRural Finance in Central Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
