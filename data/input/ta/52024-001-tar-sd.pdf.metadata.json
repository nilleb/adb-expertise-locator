Introduction \n \n1.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has a long tradition of formulating five-year plans \nto address development challenges and promote social and economic development. The plans \nlay out the strategic objectives of the country, set up work priorities of the government, and provide \nguidance for market activities. Since the founding of the PRC, the country has formulated a total \nof 13 five-year plans; each one has had a significant impact on the PRC\u2019s development during \nthe plan period. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided support through number of \ntechnical assistance (TA) that provided strategic advice to both the 12th and 13th plans. Currently, \nthe  implementation  of  the  13th  plan,  2016\u20132020  is  ongoing,  and  close  to  midterm.  The \nGovernment plans to start the midterm review of the 13th plan in June 2018 and then, drawing on \nthe review\u2019s findings and conclusions, start the preparation of the 14th plan, which will cover the \nperiod 2021\u20132025. This will be a critical period for the PRC as it aims to move beyond the current \ngoal of a \u201cmoderately prosperous\u201d society and transitions towards a high-income economy and a \nmodern society focused on developing the broader well-being of the population. \n \n2.  Three areas tightly relevant to this broader well-being of the population were jointly \nidentified and selected by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and ADB \nfor the proposed TA.  \n(i)  People-centered and environmentally sustainable urbanization. The substudy \nwill focus on issues in these areas: (a) low-carbon and climate-resilient urban \ndevelopment;  (b)  city-cluster  and  urban\u2013rural  development  cooperation  and \npartnerships; and (c) social inclusion, covering issues of the social protection \ndesign and accessibility to social protection benefits and basic public services, \nmaking cities healthier, and the migrant-related aspects of these challenges. \n(ii)  Demographic transition. The substudy will cover the following issues: (a) trends \nand characteristics of demographic transition; (b) family planning policies and \nservices, including the two-child policy, reproductive health for mothers, and others \nthat respond to the needs of families following the policies; (c) health and education \nservices for infants and young children; (d) and other salient demographic issues \nincluding  the  skewed  birth  ratio,  regional  and  urban\u2013rural  distributions  of \npopulation, and migration. \n(iii)  Ecological civilization. The substudy will build on past and ongoing ADB work, \nand  international  best  practices  to  recommend  necessary  policy  reforms  for \nenvironmental protection (air, water, and soil pollution control), ecosystem and \nnatural resources management, and environmental regulation and administration. \n \n3.  The TA will be divided into two phases. The immediate goal of the TA is to conduct a \nmidterm review of the 13th plan in the above-mentioned three key areas. The midterm review will \nassess progress against the objectives of the 13th plan in these areas, the effectiveness of the \npolicy changes and institutional and or legal reforms that have been implemented, and the \nchallenges that remain to achieve the goals of the 13th plan. It will also discuss the challenges to \nthe 13th plan posed by trends in global and domestic socioeconomic context.  \n \n4.  The second phase of the TA will build on the findings and conclusions of the midterm \nreview and carry research in these three areas forward to provide inputs into the preparation of \nthe 14th plan. The research will draw on relevant international experience in formulating its \nanalysis and recommendations. The proposed reforms will be sequenced and linked to a central \n ", "2 \n \ntheme of transitioning to higher quality development in the pursuit of national well-being. To this \nend, the second phase will develop an overarching central theme for the study that will be \ndiscussed  and  agreed  once  the  governments  priorities  for  the  14th  plan  are  more  firmly \nestablished. An overview report will be prepared that will summarize the findings, conclusions, \nand policy recommendations under the overarching central theme. \n \n5.  To facilitate the transition from the midterm review of the 13th plan to the initial research \nof the 14th plan, and to better define the overarching central theme for the study, it is proposed \nthat a high-level academic conference be convened in the second half of 2018. The conference \nwill involve senior PRC government officials, eminent international experts, and celebrated \nnational specialists to (i) comment on the midterm review; (ii) discuss the latest thinking on \u201cnew \nmodels of progress\u201d and how  the PRC may apply these to its own long term-strategy; and (iii) \ncommission a series of papers for the conference that could provide the intellectual underpinnings \nfor the study for the 14th plan.1 The conference would aim to draw experts from the PRC, ADB, \nCanada, France, Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, United States, and others.  \n \n6.  The proposed TA will require a total of 45 person-months of consulting services (11 \ninternational consultants for a total of 22 person-months and 8 national consultants for a total of \n23 person-months).2 ADB will engage individual consultants and procure TA financed goods in \naccordance with ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nassociated Project Administration Instructions/TA Staff Instructions.
