INTRODUCTION \n1.  One of the goals of Strategy 2020\u2014the long-term strategic framework of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)\u2014is increased partnership-based cofinancing and implementing of \nADB operations.1 The strategy specifies that ADB\u2019s cofinancing will increase at a faster rate \nthan its stand-alone financing operations, with a long-term objective of having total annual direct \ncofinancing  exceed  the  value  of  ADB\u2019s  standalone  project  financing.  Specifically,  ADB\u2019s \ncofinancing partnerships aim to (i) mobilize additional financial resources through cofinancing; \n(ii) complement and draw upon the comparative advantage and knowledge of its partners; and \n(iii)  broaden,  replicate,  and  sustain  its  development  impact  by  ensuring  coordination  and \navoiding duplication. This regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) project will \nbenefit developing member countries (DMCs) by enhancing timely cofinancing opportunities and \ndeepening dialogue between potential donors and recipient DMC governments at the pre-\nproject design stage. It will also add to DMCs\u2019 knowledge about each donor\u2019s development \nagenda and unique policies, guidelines, and requirements for financing partnerships. \n \n2.  To be successful in official cofinanced projects, DMC governments need to be familiar \nwith (i) their current and potential donors\u2019 priority areas of financing, (ii) cofinancing procedures \nand regulations, and (iii) ADB\u2019s cofinancing frameworks. The TA will provide a range of tools to \nsupport DMCs with donors to gain this knowledge. It will also enhance the networks of DMCs, \ndonors,  and  ADB,  including  the  Resident  Mission  and  Representative  Offices  Cofinancing \nAnchors Network established in early 2011.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The ability of DMC governments to strategize their approach to donors\u2019 aid frameworks \nvaries across regions, countries, and agencies. A lack of knowledge about donors\u2019 requirements \nand procedures may limit DMCs\u2019 access to potential new financing opportunities and result in \nweak  policy  dialogue  and  results  monitoring,  and  less  attractive  sector  and  thematic \ndevelopment scenarios. There are a number of common challenges, including insufficient staff \nresources combined with high staff turnover and weak knowledge transfer. \n \n4.  In order for DMCs to respond to recent challenges, it is important to have a sophisticated \nresults-monitoring  environment.  Because  of  donors\u2019  growing  demands  for  more  stringent \nmanagement practices of cofinanced projects and reporting of development results, as well as a \nmore  focused  and  streamlined  approach  to  strategic  development,  precise  knowledge  of  \ndonors\u2019 detailed requirements is crucial. \n \n5.  The  need  to  develop  a  wider  range  of  cofinancing  opportunities  is  driven  by  (i) \nchallenges in the global partner environment, (ii) the emergence and availability of efficient \ninformation sharing mechanisms, and (iii) a more sophisticated framework of match making \nbetween the needs of DMCs and potential donors. This requires a variety of tailor-made tools, \nincluding information technology solutions, so that ADB can be more effective and efficient in \naddressing the demands of both potential donors and recipient governments. The TA framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

The TA will contribute to DMCs by assisting them to increase their portfolio of cofinanced \nprojects in line with ADB\u2019s long-term objective of increasing direct value-added cofinancing. This \nwill be measured by the Strategy 2020 monitoring reports for the progress of partnerships. The \nTA project outcome will be a more systematic approach to potential donors for increasing \ncofinancing opportunities for DMCs. The impact of this TA will be measured by the increased \npipeline  of  potential  cofinancing  projects,  more  practical  dialogue  on  the  potential  future \nfinancing  opportunities  and  collaboration  with  ADB,  and  closer  person-to-person  networks \namong DMC officials, the cofinancing anchors network, and donors. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The outcome will be achieved through three outputs. The first output will be to develop \ncomprehensive tools and materials for the external financing opportunity seminars, which will be \ncarried out for selected DMCs. Representatives from the donors\u2019 field offices will also be invited. \nThis component will include research on donors to identify their official aid budget framework, \nincluding the authority and responsibilities delegated to their field offices. The results of this \nresearch will be one of the key inputs of the Financial Partners Handbook to be produced under \nthe second output of the TA. The seminar materials will also include (i) general requirements \nand procedures for processing projects with cofinancing, (ii) the cofinancing opportunities that \nexist  at  each  stage  of  the  project  cycle,  and  (iii)  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  implementing  and \nadministering projects with cofinancing. Several case studies will be included, particularly on \nprojects with issues. The seminar will be conducted in at least three DMCs. Lessons learned, \nincluding participant feedback, will be shared with other DMCs to improve successive seminars.  \n \n8.  The second output will be a Financial Partners Handbook based mainly on the research \nconducted for the first output. This handbook will include each donor\u2019s (i) governance structure \nfor official development assistance budget decision making; (ii) process for setting their aid \ntarget areas; (iii) current potential or notional amounts for each aid target; (iv) procedures on \nhow to allocate the aid budget for each field office; (v) relationship between their capital\u2019s central \naid budget unit and field offices, and the background for their delegation of power and authority; \nand (vi) critical issues relating to each donor for DMCs\u2019 awareness. For this component, the TA \nimplementation  team  will  pay  careful  attention  to  honoring  each  donor\u2019s  confidentiality \nrequirements. \n \n9.  To maintain the sustainability and improve the quality of information for stakeholders, it \nis essential to have a strong platform for a knowledge network. The third output of this TA will be \nthe establishment of such a platform to provide practical benefits to the network participants. \nSupported by the cofinancing anchors network, the TA implementation team will identify and \nsurvey the potential beneficiaries of the network to identify their needs and anticipated benefits. \nAfter developing a framework and an organizational modality, the team will examine with the \nbeneficiaries the feasibility of the network\u2019s sustainability. This component will also include \ndeveloping an appropriate database for single and multi-donor trust funds, including Financing \nPartnership Facilities. Finally, the TA will announce the establishment of the network to the \nrelevant agencies to ensure its visibility. \n \n ", "3 \n \n10.  The  selection  of  DMCs2  will  be  based  on  consultations  with  regional  departments \nconsidering the following criteria: (i) the number of cofinancing transactions: current portfolio \nand pipelines; (ii) the type, frequency, and complexity of cofinancing arrangements, issues, or \nproblems; (iii) the number and operations of cofinancing partners present in the DMC; (iv) the \nopenness of the DMC to cofinancing; and (v) the willingness of the resident mission to host the \nseminar. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-other sources). The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB is the executing agency. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance \nwith the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \nThe consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (April 2010, as amended from time to time). The assignment will require input from \ninternational (10 person-months) and national (18 person-months) consultants on an intermittent \nbasis. The consultants will be recruited on an individual basis.  \n \n13.  The Office of Cofinancing Operations will lead the implementation of the TA and will \ncooperate with the cofinancing anchors network. The TA will be implemented over 18 months \n(from 1 February 2012 to 31 July 2013). The TA implementation team\u2014in collaboration with \nmembers of the cofinancing anchors network\u2014will submit work plans, organize cofinancing \nopportunity seminars, coordinate and participate in the events, and collate statistics and data to \nmeasure the TA performance. Consultants will assist TA implementation by (i) handling the \nlogistical aspects, (ii) carrying out the activities in paras. 7\u20139, and (iii) suggesting a possible \nfuture plan and improvements in conducting the seminars and maintaining the network. The \noutline terms of reference for these consultancy services are in Appendix 3.  \n \n14.  For cofinancing opportunity seminars, resident missions will be responsible for all local \narrangements such as issuing invitations to interested participants and providing conference \nrooms, audiovisual equipment, and secretarial assistance. The host organizers,3 if any, may \nprovide financial assistance for the participants, including the costs of renting conference rooms \nand lunch. ADB will provide the resource speakers and seminar materials.  \n \n15.  Should the donors request cofinancing opportunities seminars, the Office of Cofinancing \nOperations will communicate with the host organization and design and plan the seminar in \nclose cooperation with the organizers to suit their particular needs and preferences. Seminars \nwill be conducted in English. The Office of Cofinancing Operations recommends the seminars \nlast 1 day each.  \n \n16.  In case there are any additional events proposed and sponsored by any donor and/or \nDMC, these will be carefully assessed on a case-by-case basis, using agreed criteria to ensure \nthat  the  events  are  complementary  and  the  links  with  the  seminar  add  value.  Criteria  for \n                                                 \n2 Special consideration may need to be given to Group A countries with less cofinancing experience, if regional \ndepartments require. \n3 Like the Business Opportunities Seminar, any donor agency or development partner organization can offer to host. \n ", "4 \n \nidentifying suitable additional events may include the following: (i) the events are well publicized, \n(ii) the theme is consistent with cofinancing opportunities offered by the donors and ADB, (iii) \nthe participants\u2019 profile fits the target group for ADB cofinancing opportunities, (iv) there are \nopportunities for meaningful interaction among network participants, and (v) the organizers have \nexperience delivering well-organized events. \n \n17.  For the Financial Partners Handbook, the international consultant will be required during \nthe inception of the TA to identify donors whose detailed information are not available in public \ndocuments; the consultant may then recommend visiting the headquarters of those donors. With \nconsent from each such donor\u2019s headquarters, ADB may send the consultant to those countries \nwithin the TA budget. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening  Capacity  of  Developing  Member  Countries  in  Resource  Mobilization  and \nImplementation of Cofinanced Projects, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n \n ", "5 \nAppendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions and Risks  \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   \nImpact      Assumptions \nIncrease cofinanced  Contribute to ADB\u2019s  Cofinancing targets  ADB can continue to attract \nproject portfolio across  long-term objective: the  achieved under ADB\u2019s  financing partners by enhancing \nADB developing  total annual direct value  results framework and  their network with DMCs \nmember countries   added cofinancing will  other Strategy 2020   \nexceed the value of  progress review and \nADB\u2019s stand-alone  accomplishment reports \nfinancing operations \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncreased knowledge,  Double potential  OCO pipeline projects  Established platform works well \nskills, and confidence of  cofinancing opportunities  database for cofinancing   and appropriately \nkey DMC government  with a clearer     \nofficials in external  understanding on the  Resident mission anchor   \nresources mobilization  donors\u2019 requirements by  network reports   \nand utilization through  the DMCs personnel   Key staff turnover in concerned \neffective dialogue with    DMC and partner agencies will \nADB and financing  Closer person-to-person  be carried out smoothly with the \npartners with systematic  networks among DMC  appropriate hand-over of \napproaches.  officials, and/or regional  responsibilities \n  departments including   \nresident missions, and    \ndonors \n \nPractical dialogue on  \npotential future \ncofinancing opportunities \nand collaboration with \nADB \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
