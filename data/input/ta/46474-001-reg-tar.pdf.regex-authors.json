INTRODUCTION \n1.  Under Strategy 2020, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) identifies environmentally \nsustainable growth, including infrastructure and climate change, as a priority for development \nand operations.1 The regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) for green cities \nwill operationalize ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan,2 2012\u20132020 focusing on its three principles of \nenvironment, equity, and economics; and build on existing knowledge products developed by \nthe urban community of practice to ensure green, inclusive, and competitive cities. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \n2.  The TA emerged from discussions related to green city action plans by the Indonesia\u2013\nMalaysia\u2013Thailand  Growth  Triangle  subregional  economic  cooperation  program  of  ADB\u2019s \nSoutheast Asia Regional Cooperation Division. Scoping studies for the plans were fielded under \na 2010 regional TA project for the cities of Melaka, Malaysia and Songkhla, Thailand.4 \n \n3.  The proposed green cities TA will focus on Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and \nViet Nam to assess the potential for replicability in Southeast Asian cities. It will develop green \ncity action plans for two cities from the participating countries, subject to the agreement of the \nrespective governments. The TA will pilot test innovative approaches for urban management for \ngreen cities. It will catalyze sustainable urban development of selected Southeast Asian cities \nas regional economic green growth centers with improved quality of life. \n \n4.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  urban  sector  assessments,  strategies,  road  maps,  and \ncountry partnership strategies (CPSs) of Southeast Asian countries. The green city initiative is \nincluded as part of the stock taking and lessons from the ADB CPS, 2007\u20132011 and for the \nCPS 2012\u20132016 for Thailand;5 the interim CPS, 2011\u20132012 for Malaysia;6 and the country \noperations  business  plans,  assessments,  strategies,  and  road  maps  for  Cambodia,  Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam, which prioritize integrated urban development \nand capacity building. The TA could provide a model for taking this forward. The TA is aligned \nwith the five strategic thrusts of the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program \nStrategic Framework, 2012\u20132022.7 Subject to government agreement, in coordination with the \nresident missions, the model could be applied in all Southeast Asian countries. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Rapid urbanization is a key challenge for balancing economic growth and environmental \nsustainability to achieve improved quality of life. While Southeast Asia is one of the world\u2019s least \nurbanized regions, its urban population is growing 1.75 times faster than the world\u2019s urban \npopulation.8 Rapid urbanization strains a municipality\u2019s capacity to meet infrastructure and other \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

Cities and Climate Change.  \n2 (3). \n ", "2   \nurban service demands. Cities, as drivers of economic growth, are resource intensive. They \noccupy about 2% of the world\u2019s land, consume 75% of land resources, and contribute to global \nclimate change with their increased rate of greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the challenges \nbrought on by climate change, energy production and consumption in Southeast Asia remains \nunchanged and continues to generate enormous quantities of waste and pollution, contributing \nto environmental degradation.  \n \n6.  Lack  of  comprehensive  urban  planning  and  increased  vulnerability  from  impacts  of \nclimate-induced change are exacerbating the challenge. Cities are confronted with increasing \nair  and  water  pollution,  inadequate  water  supply,  nonrevenue  water,  inefficient  sanitation, \ndeficient drainage, flooding, and inundation due to increased vulnerability to climate change \nimpacts. Poverty makes the urban poor vulnerable to even the slightest local weather change. \nAbout 28% (57 million) of Southeast Asia\u2019s urban population lives in informal settlements often \nlocated in unsafe areas, which generates further risks to life, health, and property. \n \n7.  Lack of coordination between environmental management and urban planning has led to \ninefficient use of resources and the deterioration of environmental conditions, affecting urban \nservices and quality of life in Southeast Asian cities. Urban systems are complex, involving \nmultiple  sectors,  administrative  boundaries,  and  jurisdictions.  Thus  urban  governance  and \nmanagement  are  key  to  the  effective  delivery  of  urban  services.  The  capacity  of  local \ngovernment units and other stakeholders to mainstream environmental management quality and \nresilience into urban planning processes and service delivery needs to be enhanced. This will \nlead to efficient resource utilization and improved environment conditions, making cities livable.  \n  \n8.  For selected cities in the participating countries, the TA will promote a paradigm shift and \ndevelop comprehensive green city action plans in response to urbanization and environmental \nchallenges to balance new initiatives with required retrofits as short-, medium-, and long-term \nstrategies.  \n \n9.  The TA will help build capacity among developing member countries to develop and \nimplement policies, programs, and projects that mainstream integrated urban planning and \nenvironmental  management  that  will  enhance  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nsustainability of urban infrastructure and services. The TA will build on knowledge products \ndeveloped by the urban community of practice and synergize with proposed TA projects of the \nRegional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  for  developing  urban  management \npartnerships for capacity enhancement of urban sector agencies. Increased capacity among \ndeveloping member countries will enable ADB to better align all urban operations with the three \nstrategic agendas of Strategy 2020: inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable \ngrowth, and regional integration. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be sustainable green cities with improved quality of life in selected \nSoutheast  Asian  countries.  Such  improvements  will  be  measured  by  city  adoption  and \nimplementation of green city action plans. The outcome will be enhanced capacity of local \ngovernment units and other stakeholders for green city development and resource-efficient \nurban planning in selected cities in Southeast Asia.  \n ", "  3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA  will  have  two  outputs:  green  city  action  plans  and  urban  management \npartnerships. Additional activities, or additions to initial activities, may be proposed later based \non knowledge-sharing partnerships.  \n \n12.  Green city action plans. Plans will be developed for each city in the selected countries \nby  2015  to  mainstream  an  integrated  urban  planning  and  development  process  by \nincorporating environmental criteria and climate change adaptation and mitigation to improve \nurban  service quality  and  resilience. The  plans  will  create  a  pipeline  of  projects  and key \ninvestments for green cities by  \n \n(i)  developing  an  urban  profile  covering  environment  and  socioeconomic \nconditions,  and  a  needs  assessment  for  each  city  to  identify  and  prioritize \npotential urban sector projects for increasing resource efficiency and resilience \nin urban services; and  \n(ii)  developing  an  urban  management  and  implementation  plan,  including \ninvestment and capacity development plans for new initiatives and retrofits for \nthe short and long term. Short-term investment projects will focus on resilient \nurban services in transport, energy, and environment (water, wastewater, and \nsolid waste). \n \n13.  Urban management partnerships. Partnership will be established to develop the core \ncapacities of national and local governments, civil society, and the private sector in green city \nplanning and management by developing innovative implementation mechanisms based on two \nbroad pillars:    \n \n(i)  Knowledge.  Partnerships  will  support  knowledge  sharing  and  improved \ncompetency  in  integrated  urban  planning,  environmental  management,  and \nclimate resilience to strengthen capacity for green city project implementation. \nPartnerships  will  strengthen  linkages  with  national  strategies  to  support  the \neducation curriculum, skills and vocational education for green industry, and civil \nsociety awareness and ability to act as agents for delivery. Ultimately this will \nlead to a green economy and green jobs. Partnerships will also provide the \nplatform for green technology exchange and private sector participation, which \ncould be developed and anchored within a broader regional knowledge hub for \nSoutheast Asia.  \n(ii)  Finance. A review of existing financial mechanisms for urban sectors in the \nselected countries will identify innovative finance mechanisms for sustainable \ngreen city development, such as structuring country-specific models for urban \ninfrastructure  finance  facilities,  and  their  scope  of  operation  and  indicative \nfinancing needs.  \n \n14.  The TA will promote synergies with ongoing TA projects and knowledge products for \ninstitutional development and comprehensive needs assessments. It proposes to build on the \nUrban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund currently being prepared.9 The TA will utilize \nrelated knowledge products as applicable from ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, such as the \nintegrated urban sustainability assessments, the green cities and inclusive cities toolkits, and \n                                                \n9   To  be  financed  by  the  Department  for  International  Development  of  United  Kingdom  and  the  Rockefeller \nFoundation. \n ", "4   \ntools such as the rapid assessment of city emissions and transport emissions evaluation models \nfor project cities in partnership with the Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities. These will be used to \nconduct  economic,  environmental,  social,  financial,  and  capacity  needs  assessments  in \npreparing the green city action plans. Prioritization of projects can be conducted in partnership \nwith  the  Cities  Development  Initiative  for  Asia  using  the  city  infrastructure  investment \nprogramming and prioritization toolkit.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $720,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  governments  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, \nsecretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. No activities will \nbe financed in any participating country unless a no objection is obtained from the government \nof that country. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan is presented in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.    As the executing agency, ADB will administer the TA, through the Southeast Asia Urban \nDevelopment and Water Division (SEUW). It expects to implement the TA from January 2013 \nto July 2015. SEUW, in close coordination with Southeast Asia Regional Cooperation and \nOperations Coordination Division; Regional and Sustainable Development Department; and \ncountry  offices,  will  work  in  cooperation  with  the  national government  organizations,  local \ngovernments,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  other  international  organizations  in  the \ntargeted countries. An urban development expert (international consultant, 15 person-months) \nwill coordinate the TA. The consultant will collaborate and coordinate inputs from key divisions \nwithin  ADB  and  other  agencies  to  develop  synergies  with  sustainable  transport,  energy \nefficiency, and regional cooperation. ADB will engage an international consulting firm (about 56 \nperson-months), including national specialists to carry out the TA activities in close coordination \nwith the project officer and urban development consultant (Appendix 3). Key expertise will \ninclude an urban and regional planner, environmental engineer, energy efficiency specialist, \nsustainable transport specialist, water and wastewater specialist, solid waste management \nspecialist,  institutional  management  specialist,  financial  specialist,  and  social  development \nspecialist. ADB will engage the consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection with \n90:10  weightage  for  technical  and  financial  expertise.  This  ratio  is  proposed  due  to  the \nimportance of specific technical skills required in delivering the task, comprising the integration \nof  urban  planning,  environment  management,  climate  resilience,  and  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment. Consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n17.  The  TA  will  adopt  an  implementation  framework  for  each  participating  country \n(supplementary  appendix,  available  upon  request).  Each  country  will  establish  a  national \nworking group and a city working group to implement the TA.  These groups will comprise \nsenior government officials and enable incorporation of green growth strategies linked to long-\nterm national economic development policies. The green growth strategies will influence project \nmanagement in the cities and be coordinated across various local departments focusing on \nurban development. Each ministry will designate a green growth officer to oversee its projects \nand coordinate with the national and city working groups. The working groups will include \nrepresentatives from the planning, finance, energy, environment, urban development, housing, \n ", "  5 \npublic works, and transport ministries. They will provide strategic direction, policy reform, and \nguidelines  to  prepare  green  city  action  plans;  develop  and  operationalize  a  green  growth \nstrategy; prepare a time-bound action plan with specific targets and indicators; and establish the \nlegal framework for enactment. City working groups will be established in local governments \nand  include  representatives  of  local  government,  private  sector,  academia,  industry, \nnongovernment organizations, and community-based organizations. The TA will generate ideas \nfor engaging the private sector to mobilize green city investments.  \n \n18.  SEUW will develop a monitoring system for the TA to cover activities, inputs, outputs, \noutcomes, and financial management. A regional conference and in-country workshops will be \nused  to  disseminate  project  results  and  knowledge  products  on  successful,  replicable \ninternational practices, and develop country-appropriate response mechanisms for green city \ngrowth. A green city index (indicators) will be developed as part of the TA\u2019s environment quality \ndata and urban profile. Green city citizen scorecards will be developed for the city governments \nto monitor quality of life indicators. Community-based organizations will participate in developing \nthe criteria for scoring and in mobilizing the citizen feedback mechanism.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.
