INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will contribute to strengthening \ngender mainstreaming processes and instruments and their implementation within government \nstakeholders in India, specifically select state departments and executing and implementing \nagencies of Asian Development Bank (ADB)-supported projects. To achieve this, the TA will help \n(i) create and strengthen mechanisms that can methodically and systematically incorporate \ngender-responsive measures across sectors; (ii) enhance the capacity of state department \nofficers  in  applying gender  budgeting tools;  (iii)  develop  customized  resources  on gender-\nresponsive planning and budgeting across select sectors and thematic areas; and (iv) develop an \ne-governance tool that collates information on schemes and entitlements related to women, \nincluding good practices on gender mainstreaming across sectors and thematic areas. The TA \nwill contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5 to \nachieve gender equality and empower all women and girls in India. \n \n2.  This TA supports the Three-Year Action Plan (2017-18 to 2019-20) of the Government of \nIndia.1 The key action agenda of the plan includes building an inclusive society with special \nemphasis on enhancing the welfare of vulnerable groups, including women. This TA is also in line \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, which supports gender equality and women\u2019s \nempowerment (GEWE) in key sectors.2 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s Country Operations Business \nPlan for India, 2019\u20132021.3 \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Despite its comprehensive efforts to promote GEWE, India has witnessed persistent \ngender inequality challenges. While India\u2019s gender development index improved in 2016 (0.819 \nfrom 0.795 in 2015), it continues to be grouped with countries with low gender equality in human \ndevelopment.  The  Human  Development  Report  2016  by  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme reflects stark inequalities in important indicators such as mean years of schooling \n(4.8 among females and 8.2 among males) and estimated gross national income per capita \n($2,184 among females and $8,897 among males).4 This is consistent with the Global Gender \nGap Report 2016 of the World Economic Forum, which ranked India 113th (out of 144 countries) \nin economic participation and opportunities, and educational attainment.5 Other gender issues \nhighlighted in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India are (i) female employment in India\u2019s \norganized sector was low (20.5%); and (ii) low asset ownership, particularly land, affects women\u2019s \naccess to extension services, training, new technologies, and credit. \n \n4.  The  international  discourse  on  gender  budgeting  developed  (i)  out  of  a  growing \nunderstanding that macroeconomic policies contribute to narrowing or widening gender equality \ngaps, and (ii) when gender budgeting emerged as an important tool to scrutinize government \nbudgets for their contribution to gender equality. Gender budgeting is now widely accepted as an \nimportant  strategy  for  good  governance  and  inclusive  policy  implementation.  There  is  an \nincreased  recognition  and  evidence  that  gender  equality  investments  could  help  achieve \ndevelopment goals, including alleviating poverty, enhancing human security and increasing \n                                                \n1  NITI Aayog. 2017.

Geneva. \n ", "2 \n \nlivelihood options.6 Empirical data from existing studies that explore the links between gender \ninequality, economic growth, and development showcase the gains of investing in the education \nof girls. A 30-year data set across select Asia and Pacific countries indicate that, for a 1% rise in \nthe ratio of female\u2013male secondary schooling, the annual per capita gross domestic product \ngrowth rates were increased by 0.3%. A 1-year rise in schooling attainment of females over 15 \nyears of age resulted in decreased total fertility rates of 0.4%. Also, a 1.0% rise in the female\u2013\nmale education ratio decreased under-5 mortality rates by 1.4%.7 Given the centrality of budgets \nin public policy, gender budgeting in India is recognized and officially endorsed as a framework \nto  promote  and  analyze  government  policy  commitments  in  mitigating  gender  inequality \nchallenges. \n \n5.  Almost 90 countries have engaged in some form of gender budgeting initiative. In Asia \nand the Pacific alone, around 29 countries have adopted gender budgeting strategies.8 A few of \nthese countries\u2014Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, and Sri Lanka\u2014have \nadopted  innovative  strategies  including  institutionalizing  legislative  commitment  to  gender \nbudgeting,  strengthening  mechanisms  within  the  budgetary  processes,  implementing \ncollaborative action between important actors in gender budgeting, strengthening gender audits \nwithin beneficiary-oriented programs and schemes, mainstreaming audit of gender budget as part \nof the audit mandate, introducing penalty systems for noncompliance with gender budgeting \nguidelines,  and  planning  gender  budgeting  initiatives  (GBIs)  with  a  thematic  focus. These \ncountries provide a wide array of GBIs that can be studied, scaled up, and customized for \nstrengthening gender budgeting in India for improved GEWE outcomes.  \n \n6.  In India, the Ministry of Women and Child Development is the nodal agency for promoting \ngender equality. The government officially endorsed gender budgeting as an effective strategy for \ngender mainstreaming at the national level, and state governments were also directed to follow \nsuit.9 The Ministry of Finance introduced a gender budget statement in 2005\u20132006, which \ncaptures  the  quantum  of  allocations  for  women  across  programs  of  line  ministries  and \ndepartments. Gender budget cells were constituted within various ministries and departments \nwith the express mandate to serve as nodal mechanisms to ensure that gender issues are \nidentified  and  addressed  across  sectors.  Several  state  governments  took  measures  to \ninstitutionalize gender budgeting. The slow pace and uneven magnitude of gender budgeting \nremains  across  most  states. 10  GBIs  at  the  state  level  are also faced  with  (i) \nan ineffective approach  centered  on  gender  budget  statements;  (ii)  weak  institutional \nmechanisms  and  capacities,  e.g.,  nonfunctional  gender  budget  cells;  (iii)  methodological \nlimitations of the gender budget format; and (iv) methodological irregularities in reporting gender \nbudgets  under  identified  categories.  Further,  interregional  cross-learning  from  innovative \nstrategies is also lacking, which could play an important role in encouraging national and state \ndepartments to adopt good practices.  \n                                                \n6  United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, 56th session. 27 February\u20139 March 2012.

Gender Responsive \nBudgeting in the Asia\u2013Pacific Region: A Status Report.  \n9  In 2005\u20132006, the Government of India officially adopted and institutionalized  the gender budget, with the \nintroduction of the gender budget statement in the union budget. The Eleventh Plan (2007\u20132012) identified the \ngender budget as an important strategy for gender equality. The plan underlined that the gender budget should be \nimplemented across the board and sectors. State governments were directed to adopt the same approach and reflect \nthis in the annual plans. \n10 Swapna Bist Joshi. 2014. Assessing Gender Equality Investments: A Multi-State Perspective.

The need for capacity development remains broad given the size and diversity of India, \nthe growing number of stakeholders involved in governance and the entry of new staff for new \nprojects.  Moreover,  with  greater  devolution  of  funds  from  the  union  government  to  state \ngovernments through the Fourteenth Finance Commission, and the increasing share of funds for \nstate governments to implement development programs, it is imperative that efforts are invested \nin gender budgeting capacity development at the state level. It is important that cross-learning \nfrom first-hand experience in selected regional gender budgeting strategies is initiated through \nnational learning workshops. The peer learning programs will support study of these experiences \nand their customization to strengthen state-specific GBIs. \n \n8.  E-governance has emerged as an important tool to ensure enhanced access to services. \nThe vision of the national e-governance plan, approved by the government in 2006, is to make all \ngovernment  services  accessible  through  common  service  delivery  outlets  and  ensure  the \nefficiency, transparency, and reliability of such services. The potential of e-governance as a key \nmechanism to facilitate cross-learning within and across various tiers of governance and to \nenhance awareness and access of women to schemes and entitlements remains unexplored. \n \n9.  The TA is a response to these problems and gaps. It will contribute to an improved gender \ndevelopment  index and gender  empowerment  measure  and  help  mitigate  gender-specific \ndevelopment  challenges.  The  TA  initiatives  will  help  develop  and  reinforce  institutional \nmechanisms that will sustain and impact gender equality investments within sectors, therefore \naffecting relevant indicators, albeit gradually. More specifically, under the TA (i) gender budgeting \nmechanisms will be refined and strengthened; (ii) training methodologies and knowledge products \nwill be informed of specific sector and thematic gender issues; (iii) capacities of state officials on \napplication of gender budgeting tools and in regional GBIs will be enhanced; and (iv) an e-\ngovernance tool will be created to promote cross-learning among different levels of government \nand also enhance awareness and access of women to schemes and entitlements.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Greater gender benefits through government \nschemes and programs.11 The TA will have the following outcome: Institutional capacities in \ngender budgeting and gender mainstreaming of state departments of select TA states and \nexecuting and implementing agencies of ADB-assisted projects enhanced.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Gender budgeting mechanisms refined and strengthened. The TA will help \nrefine and strengthen gender budgeting mechanisms in four states: Andhra Pradesh, Himachal \nPradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Manipur.13 This will be done after a thorough diagnosis of issues \nthrough scoping studies and through recommendations for endorsement and follow-up. Existing \nADB-assisted gender-oriented projects in the state concerned may be taken up as platforms for \ndemonstrating gender budgeting mechanisms. \n \n                                                \n11 Mission statement of the Ministry of Women and Child Development on budgeting for gender equity. \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 The states were selected based on: (i) being recommended by the Ministry of Women and Child Development and \nDepartment of Economic Affairs, and (ii) being ADB priority states. \n ", "4 \n12.  Output 2: Knowledge products developed, including customized training modules. \nThrough research, the TA will help (i) create the evidence on sector application of gender \nbudgeting tools, and (ii) develop customized training resources and knowledge products based \non the evidence generated. The training modules will be used to build capacities of sector state \ndepartments and executing and implementing agencies of ADB-assisted projects. \n \n13.  Output 3: Gender budgeting capacities of government stakeholders strengthened. \nUnder the TA, a comprehensive gender budgeting capacity development plan will be prepared to \nfacilitate sustained capacity building of state departments, executing and implementing agencies \nof ADB-assisted projects, and other stakeholders. This will involve (i) a training needs assessment \nto  guide  needs-based  training  programs;  (ii)  a  comprehensive  gender  budgeting  capacity \ndevelopment plan and calendar based on the training needs assessment; (iii) trainings and \nworkshops for government representatives; (iv) national lateral learning programs with national \nand international resource team members to understand GBIs and assess their scalability; and \n(v) pre- and post-assessment tools to evaluate training and exposure visit effectiveness and also \nto prepare a methodology to evaluate training impacts. \n \n14.  Output 4: E-governance tool developed. This output will develop an e-governance tool \nto strengthen support mechanisms focused on gender mainstreaming practices and information \nrelated to women\u2019s schemes and entitlements. This will include research to (i) list various gender-\nspecific schemes and entitlements across departments, and other information; and (ii) create a \nknowledge pool of information on good practices on gender mainstreaming and gender budgeting \nacross state governments and development partners. This will help create a knowledge bank and \nfacilitate cross-learning on gender mainstreaming practices across all stakeholders. It will also \nfacilitate  enhanced  access  of  the  most  marginalized  women  to  government  schemes  and \nservices. Special efforts will be made to ensure that the services reach the socially excluded and \nthe most vulnerable women. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.5 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. 14 The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n16.  The following are ineligible expenditures under the 2017 JFPR policy guidelines and are \nnot included in the TA project\u2019s financing plan (Appendix 2): (i) purchase of vehicles, (ii) salaries \nfor civil servants, (iii) foreign travel,15 (iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) detailed engineering \ndesign, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) items on ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items \n(or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List.16  \n \n17.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace for the project management unit, meeting venues, access to data and information, staff \ntime  to  review  outputs  of  consultants  and  conduct  periodic  field  visits,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The counterpart fund will be 25% of the JFPR TA value and 20% of of the TA total. \n \n \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2011.
