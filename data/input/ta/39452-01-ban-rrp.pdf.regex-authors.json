I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Strengthening  Governance  Management \nProject.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting \nGovernance Management Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project seeks to improve transparency and accountability of public service delivery \nin  tax  and  land  record  administrations  in  Bangladesh  with  the  help  of  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT). The three outputs of the project are (i) online filing of tax \nreturns, (ii) digitized land records management system in selected districts, and (iii) improved \naccess to tax and land information in specialized information and service centers.1 \n \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Despite persistent poverty,2 Bangladesh is on track to achieve the 2015 Millennium \nDevelopment Goal target of reducing income poverty by half, has made progress in other \nindicators of well-being (such as for infant and child mortality), and has met the target for gender \nparity in primary and secondary schooling. While some progress has been made in alleviating \npoverty (e.g., during 2000\u20132005, income poverty was reduced from 48.9% to 40%, or by 1.8 \npercentage points annually), income inequalities widened, especially in the 1990s, and poverty \nreduction has been uneven across regions (with the urban areas not seeing great reduction in \npoverty). It does not help that the country has a rather limited resource base, especially from \ndirect taxes, from which to augment public investment in economic and social infrastructure. \nThe income tax to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio in Bangladesh is hovering around 2%, as \nagainst 4% in Pakistan and more than 6% in India. \n \n4.  Compounding this problem is the lack of good governance in the country. For five \nconsecutive years from 2001 to 2005, Bangladesh was placed at the bottom of the list in \nTransparency International's corruption perceptions index.3 Other universal indices (such as the \nGlobal Integrity Report, Doing Business Survey) and national surveys (such as the state of \ngovernance) also consistently show that there is still much progress to be made in governance \nreforms, and in ensuring that the average citizen perceives that the state provides effective, \ntransparent, and accountable public services.  \n \n5.  It is now universally recognized that good governance can help a country to improve \nallocative  efficiency  of  limited  resources. While  macro  policy-based  reforms  are  necessary \n \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance to help prepare a follow up \nprogram to the Good Governance Program. ADB. 2009. Technical assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of \nBangladesh for Preparing the Governance Management Program. Manila. \n2  Bangladesh is a country that is primarily dependent on agriculture and has a narrow base of exports. Although \nagriculture and allied activities contribute 21% of gross domestic product (GDP), 48% of the labor force depends \non agriculture. Given the rather poor performance of the agriculture sector historically, this has contributed to \npersistent poverty, with an estimated 56 million in poverty in 2005. \n3  Transparency International. 2005. Corruption Perceptions Index. Berlin. ", "2   \nconditions for good governance,4 the conditions need to be commensurate with the changes in \nthe delivery mechanism, supported by state-of-the-art technologies. ICT applications have the \npotential to trigger and shape significant changes in the delivery of public services and in the \nway governments function. The ruling party's own election manifesto and the Government's \nDigital Bangladesh strategy acknowledge this. In this regard, as in many other developing \ncountries, the Government has promoted e-governance applications in recent years to foster \ngrowth and development and to enhance the quality of service delivery.  \n \n6.  The project is consistent with the country partnership strategy 5and is in conformity with \nthe recommendations made in the 2009 country assistance program evaluation in Bangladesh, \nwhich found  that  lack of good governance  in  many  areas  is  one  of  the  country's  binding \nconstraints on growth, and recommended support for further governance reforms.6 The Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) country operations business plan for 2010\u20132012 for Bangladesh7 \nstates that ADB will continue to provide assistance in improving governance in Bangladesh by \nenhancing governance management capacity. Recognizing the need for the application of ICT \ntools for improved governance, the Supporting Governance Management Project identifies three \nkey  areas  where  the  application  of  ICT  tools  has  the  potential  to  enhance  efficiency, \ntransparency, and accountability in public service delivery: \n \n(i)  Tax administration is one of the most promising areas where good governance \ncan lead to significant gains in terms of increasing tax revenues and in enhancing \ntransparency in tax filing. Indeed, a country's tax policy is in many ways only as \ngood as the supporting tax administration.8 It is widely accepted that filing tax \nreturns online can significantly improve tax compliance and revenue buoyancy. \nElectronic tax filing is one example of how automation can assist in facilitating \nprocessing of tax files.9 Another benefit of electronic tax filing is the elimination of \nthe  interface  between  the  taxpayer  and  tax  officer,  thereby  reducing  the \nincidence of corruption and other alleged fraudulent practices. \n \n(ii)  Proper land records management is another area where the application of ICT \ntools can greatly enhance the quality of public service delivery. Digitization of \nland records is one of the important prerequisites for improvements in land-\nrelated services and good administration that also aim to reduce harassment of \nthe average landowner and small business owner in registering property. In an \nagriculture-dependent  economy  where  marginalized  landholding  by  small \nfarmers is a defining characteristic, maintaining land records is a precondition not \nonly for land reform policies to be successfully implemented but also for social \n                                                \n4  Steps taken by the previous caretaker government and the present one as part of the support rendered by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) under the Good Governance Program have provided a broad measure of policy \ncoverage to such good-governance reforms. Two of the most critical reforms are the separation of the judiciary \nfrom the executive, and promulgation of the Right to Information Act. ADB. 2007.

Manila.  \n8  For example, empirical estimates suggest that Indonesia's tax administration reforms since 2002 had a strong \npositive impact on the tax yield. The non-oil and gas revenue to GDP ratio increased from 9.9% in 2002 to 11.6% \nin 2005 without many changes in tax policies. The result was particularly striking in the case of value-added tax. \nSome of the important reforms include (i) setting up a unit for large taxpayers, (ii) improving tax audit, and (iii) \nimproving human resource management. (Source: J. Brondolo et al. 2008. Tax Administration Reform and Fiscal \nAdjustment: The Case of Indonesia. IMF Working Paper No. WP-08-129. Washington, DC.)  \n9  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (Appendix 2). ", "  3 \njustice. Moreover, Bangladesh is one of the most crowded countries in the world \nand competition for land is fierce. As such, and because of forged ownership \nrecords, disputes over land ownership are the biggest single cause of court \ncases in Bangladesh. It has been reported that land disputes can take anywhere \nfrom 3 years to 45 years to be resolved.10 It has also been reported that almost \n80% of legal battles (criminal cases) in Bangladesh are about land (the number is \nexpected to be even higher in civil cases). Given that court cases (both civil and \ncriminal) can be a major source of harassment to the poor, it makes business \nsense to try to alleviate the primary cause of the case, i.e., inaccurate records of \nland holdings. The use of ICT in land records management enables accelerated \nstorage, processing, and retrieval of information in land records. Digitization of \nland records can also help to generate revenue, since proper land records help \nthe government to raise significantly higher revenue from land. \n \n(iii)  The success of any good governance initiative\u2014based on the principle of a \nparticipatory approach\u2014critically depends on equal access to information, and \nbidirectional information flows. Good governance principles alone cannot help to \nalleviate poverty without equal and easy access to all relevant information for the \ncitizenry.11 Weak and inadequate information infrastructure systems, as well as \nlimited financial resources to develop or strengthen them, could easily derail the \ngood governance initiatives. The advent of ICT tools through the designated \ninformation  centers makes  equal  access  to  information  possible  even  in the \nremote villages, provided these centers are effectively designed and properly \nmanaged. Thus, the information centers could benefit the communities and the \ngovernment in many ways, including by: (a) saving on costs of compliance with \ngovernment rules and procedures, (b) reducing harassment by middlemen, (c) \nproviding  additional  information  to  make  the  good  governance  initiatives \nsuccessful, and (d) helping the government to accomplish the desired outcomes \nof the proposed good governance initiatives. However, considerable efforts are \nneeded to address the information constraints and difficulties with financial and \ntechnical support.12 Research has shown that the benefit on investment from a \ntelecenter can be high. Thus, supporting the government's endeavor to promote \ninformation sharing is important to achieving the overall impact of the project.13 \n \n                                                \n10 See,  e.g.,  Shahjahan  Siraj.  2009.  Bangladesh:  Reduced  to  Beggars  by  Land  Dispute.  11  May \n(http://www.panos.org.uk/?lid=27387);  and  Corruption  blamed  for  poor,  lengthy  land  services \n(http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=150899&cid=2). In 2004, economics professor Abul Barkat of Dhaka \nUniversity calculated that, at the current rate of progress in dispensing with court cases, it would take \u201c30 million \nyears for all the cases to be resolved\" (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3533817.stm).  \n11 Nora  Quebral  of  the  University  of  the  Philippines  first  emphasized  the  importance  of  communication  and \ninformation in the participatory development process, and used the term \u201cdevelopment communication\u201d (N.C. \nQuebral. 1971. Development communication in the agricultural context. Paper presented at the symposium In \nSearch  of  Breakthroughs  in  Agricultural  Development, College  of  Agriculture,  University  of  the  Philippines, \nLaguna). \n12 This is especially true because Bangladesh ranks very poorly in terms of internet penetration when compared with \nother Asian countries (http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats3.htm#asia). Internet penetration is just 0.4% of the \npopulation, as against the Asian average of 20.1%. \n13 There are many examples of ICT applications for improved service delivery: (i) Lokavani in the Sitapur district of \nIndia; (ii) People First Network (PFNet) in Solomon Islands; (iii) Akshaya, Bhoomi, e-Seva, and Janmitra in India; \nand (iv) Sarvadaya Program in Sri Lanka (http://www.apdip.net/apdipenote/11.pdf for details).

Overarching the support in these three areas is the project focus on capacity building. \nImproved  business  processes  and  public  service  delivery  cannot  be  implemented  and \nmaintained unless capacity development is an integral part of the new initiatives. Therefore, the \nproject seeks to build the capacity of government staff members concerned, including those of \nthe executing agencies. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The intended impact of the project will be enhanced public trust in central government \nfor service delivery. The project outcome will be improved transparency and accountability in tax \nand land record administrations. Its focus on e-governance at the local level is important as it \ncarries forward the policy-based reforms of the ongoing Good Governance Program (footnote \n2). The project will be spread over 45 upazilas in five districts, in relation to land records \ndigitization, and in 20 information and service centers throughout the country, in relation to \naccess to tax information.14 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  The project will have three outputs: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Online filing of tax returns. The areas that will be targeted here are \n(a) online filing of tax returns by designing the software, and (b) strengthening the \nICT capacity of the income tax circles.15  \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Digitized land records management system in selected districts. \nThe project will help pilot a digitized land records management system in 45 \nupazilas (subdistricts) of five districts in phases, with necessary corrections in the \nproject implementation strategy. The activities will include (a) digitizing text data, \n(b) digitizing cadastral paper maps, and (c) linking all spatial and text files. The \nproject will develop a web-based database of (a) land records in five districts and \n45 upazilas, and (b) the particulars of any plot of land including its map and \nrecords of rights in the selected districts and upazilas.   \n \n(iii)  Output  3:  Improved  access  to  tax  and  land  information  in  specialized \ninformation  and  service  centers. The project will help design, set up, and \nmanage (a) 20 tax information and service centers at the major income tax \ncircles (including one at the National Board of Revenue office in Dhaka), and (b) \n20  land  information  and  service  centers  in  the  selected  upazilas  out  of  45 \nupazilas selected for digitized land record management system. The activities will \ninclude (a) creating an effective design for these centers, (b) procuring computer \nhardware, (c) planning and designing the information and service contents of \nthese centers,16 and (d) recruiting customer service associates to manage these \ncenters for a limited period.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n14 The selection of districts and upazilas shall be finalized in the immediate near term.  \n15 The country is geographically divided into 303 income tax circles for the purpose of revenue administration. \n16 It is envisaged that the taxpayers will file tax returns online from the tax information centers. Similarly, the digitized \nland records will be available online from the land information and service centers. ", "  5 \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n10.  The project is estimated to cost $30.3 million. The investment plan is summarized in \nTable 1.

The government has requested a loan in the amount of SDR16,489,000 (approximately \nequivalent to $25 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n12.  The financing plan for the project is given in Table 2. Of the total costs, ADB will finance \nSDR16,489,000 (approximately $25 million equivalent) or 82%, and the government will provide \n$5.3 million (or 18%), primarily in in-kind contributions.

One \nof the initiatives under the BICF would finance hardware for a proposed data center at NBR headquarters to \ncoordinate at the central level the process of online filing of tax returns.  \n ", "6   \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  There will be two project executing agencies for the project. The National Board of \nRevenue (NBR) will be the executing agency for outputs 1 and 3a and the Department of Land \nRecords and Survey (DLRS) will be the executing agency for outputs 2 and 3b. Each executing \nagency  shall  incorporate  a  dedicated  project  management  unit  (PMU).  A  project  steering \ncommittee (PSC) will be established to provide overall direction and guidance to\u2014and oversight \nand monitoring of\u2014the project. The secretary, Ministry of Land will chair the committee, which \nwill include one senior official at the level of a joint secretary of the relevant ministries and \nagencies. Two separate PMUs will be set-up\u2014one at NBR for outputs 1 and 3a,18 and the other \nat DLRS for outputs 2 and 3b. The PMUs will be headed by a senior level government official \nnot below the rank of a joint secretary as the project director, who will report to the PSC.   \n \n14.  The project implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in \ndetail in the PAM, which also describes the fund flow arrangements for the project. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspect   Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2010\u2013December 2013 \nEstimated project completion date  31 December 2013 \nProject management \n1.

", "  7 \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n15.  Improvements in business processes and public service delivery cannot be achieved \nand maintained unless capacity building is an integral part of the new initiatives. Therefore, the \nproject will also focus on building the capacity of government officials concerned, including staff \nof the executing agencies and implementing agencies. Thus, it is proposed that the TA for \nSupporting Governance Management Project be approved and provided in tandem with the \nStrengthening Governance Management Project in order to provide support to the government \nto enhance the capability of the relevant agencies to effectively manage the project. The TA \nproject will enhance staff members' familiarization with rules and processes and help them to \nimplement  the  loan  components.  All  procurement  in  the  TA  project  will  be  managed  in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). No \nadvance procurement or advance action is envisaged for the TA project. Capacity building will \ninclude the following three outputs  corresponding to the three project outputs: \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Project  implementation  support;  preparing  the  income  tax  audit \nmanual and training; setting up the research capacity of the National Board of \nRevenue,  including  training  on  techniques  related  to  revenue  forecasts  and \ncompliance costs; and other training.19 \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Creating adequate capacity in the PMUs to implement the proposed \nactivities. This will require hiring long-term consultants (project implementation \nexpert and information technology expert) and training government staff. \n \n(iii)  Output 3: Creating adequate capacity in the PMUs to implement the proposed \nactivities. \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA project is estimated at $980,000 equivalent. ADB will finance \n$800,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  its  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV)  to  be \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  remaining  $180,000  equivalent  will  be  contributed  by  the \ngovernment,  and  will  include  counterpart  staff  remuneration,  office  accommodation  and \nsupplies, local transport, and other logistical support.  \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements for the TA project will mimic those of the loan project. \nThe TA project components will be implemented by the relevant PMUs, with overall supervision \nby the PSC and coordination by the PMU (paras. 12\u201313). A total of 139 person-months of \nconsultancy services will be required, including 6 person-months of international consultant \nservices and 133 person-months of national consultant services.20 A consulting firm will be \nengaged  for  recruiting  the  national  consultants  using  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod with a standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. All consultants will be recruited in line with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). No advance \ncontracting  or  retroactive  financing  is  envisaged  for  consulting  services.  All  disbursements \nunder the TA  will  be made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).21  \n \n                                                \n19 Training for using the e-filing software is also included in the project cost.  \n20 These experts are available locally. Moreover, the consultants need to be proficient in the local language (Bengali). \n21 Detailed terms of reference for the consultancy packages are on file with the project office, and are available upon \nrequest. \n ", "8   \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  Outputs  1  and  2  of  the  loan  project  have  technical  components  at  their  core. \nStrengthened tax administration is expected to be brought about through the introduction of \nonline  tax  filing  software  that  has  been  tested  and  standardized.  The  software  will  be \ncustomized to fit the Bangladesh context. Digitization of land records is to be done through an \nindustry standard as well as one adopted by other governments.22 Some customization of this \napplication is expected. Positive impacts of the introduction of technology include speedier \nprocesses, and so reduced compliance costs. There are no expected negative impacts as a \nresult  of  introducing  the  technologies.  Capacity  building  support  in  the  project  will  help \ngovernment departments better manage the required technical operations. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n19.  Financial  analysis  performed  on  the  proposed  project  concluded  that  its  benefits \nconsiderably  outweigh  the  costs.23 The  financial  viability  and  sustainability  analysis  of  the \nproject was based on main financial parameters and sensitivity analysis, and on a with-project \nand without-project scenario, using the financial internal rate of return calculation on the net \nbenefits accruing from project implementation. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrated the \nrobustness of these results, with the project being financially viable even when the combination \nof changed assumptions in a worst-case scenario was tested. Comparisons of the project \nbenefits were also made against the weighted cost of capital. The economic benefits of the \nproject are harder to calculate as they are not easily quantifiable. In this context, the least-cost \napproach was followed while designing the project components to ensure that the benefits of \nthe project are most efficiently derived from the investment in this project.24  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  project  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \n21.  A  governance  risk  assessment  of  public  financial  management,  procurement,  and \ncorruption was carried out. While public expenditure and financial accountability assessment for \nBangladesh shows some systemic weaknesses in the public financial management domain, \nthese are not expected to constrain effective project implementation. Governance weakness in \nthe area of procurement primarily arises from the fact that the Government has not necessarily \nadhered to some provisions in the Procurement Act in the recent past,25 and this has meant that \ngovernance  weaknesses  in  this  area  need  to  be  more  diligently  tracked,  and  national \ncompetitive bidding should follow the ADB guidelines. While there have been substantial policy \nreforms related to the fight against corruption, recent steps to weaken the independence of the \n                                                \n22 For example, the National Land Resources Management Program in India. The National Informatics Centre in India \nis currently helping many states to develop and customize the software for this project (e.g., see one such web-\nbased software application at http://tsu.trp.nic.in/jami/). Off-the-shelf software programs are also available. \n23 Financial and Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n24 Moreover, detailed estimates of the fiscal gains of the project arising out of higher income tax and land revenue \nhave been worked out (Financial and Economic Analysis [Appendix 2]). \n25 For example, the government in 2009 abolished the clause on the need for 2 years experience for participating in \nbids of less than Tk20 million, and introduction of a lottery in case of two bidders quoting the same price. This \nrelaxation could lead to bid manipulations by vested interested groups.  ", "  9 \nanticorruption commission may not augur well for progress in anticorruption measures. Some \nmajor steps of the government (such as the right to information and the soon-to-be approved \nnational integrity strategy) demonstrate the commitment to deal with malgovernance issues, but \nthe failure to yet put in place whistleblower protection measures or establish an ombudsman's \noffice, can be construed as weaknesses in the governance agenda of the government. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n22.  The poverty reduction and social impacts of the project are very positive, although not \nvery direct.26 Enabling online tax filing and easy and accurate access to land records will reduce \nthe  scope  for  human  interaction  with  government  officials,  thus  reducing  the  scope  for \ndemanding illicit extra payments for services. This is expected to reduce the degree of hairani \n(harassment) of the average citizen and business owner. Stemming the revenue losses inherent \nin the existing system of tax filing and improving the tax auditing ability of the government will \nmean increased direct revenues for the government. These, in turn, become available for \nproductive social and economic infrastructure. There are no adverse social impacts (such as \nHIV/AIDS, human trafficking, etc.) of the project. Moreover, sex-disaggregated data on land \nownership and taxpayers will help future advocacy on gender-targeted policy reforms in the \nareas of tax and land registration. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n23.  Given the nature of the project, all three safeguard categories (environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples) are categorized as C.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n24.  The  key  risks  in  the  project  are  (i)  a  lack  of  government  commitment,  including \npersonnel, to continue with reforms and to allocate resources to implement them; (ii) a low level \nof capacity in central and local government agencies to implement the reform measures; and \n(iii) an inability or unwillingness of the citizenry to use ICT and the information centers. Overall, \nhowever, while there are risks, the integrated benefits and impacts of the project are expected \nto outweigh the potential costs from such risks. Further analysis on the risks and mitigating \nmeasures are in the Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2).  \n \n25.  The major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \n1.  Lack  of  continued  The  most  effective  mitigating  measure  for  this  risk  is  to \ngovernment  commitment  to  sustain  engagement  with  the  central  government  in \nthe reforms, and to allocating  conjunction  with  other  development  partners  so  that  a \nresources  for  implementing  consistent message is sent about the need to adhere to the \nand sustaining them  reform measures.  \n2.  Weak  implementation  There are two mitigating measures for this risk: (i) setting \ncapacity  of  implementing  aside  specific  support  to  help  the  government  agencies \nagencies  implement the reforms, and (ii) engaging continually with the \ngovernment to make more long-term and sustained provisions \nto  provide  the  necessary  capacity  to  central  and  local \ngovernment agencies. \n                                                \n26 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n ", "10  \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \n3.
