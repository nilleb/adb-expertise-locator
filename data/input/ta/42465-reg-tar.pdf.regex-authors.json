INTRODUCTION \n1.  Much of the rural population in many Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) lacks \naccess to safe, reliable, affordable, and versatile energy such as electricity. Rural electrification \nin Vanuatu is 7% and in the Solomon Islands 5%. Less than 10% of Papua New Guinea (PNG), \npredominantly urban areas, is electrified. With power often unreliable even in major urban \ncenters, it is unlikely that many rural areas will be connected to the grid in the near future. While \nenergy efficiency projects offer excellent cost effectiveness and can improve the energy security \nof Pacific DMCs, they alone will not fully address the growing energy needs of Pacific DMCs or \nprovide access to safe, reliable, affordable, and versatile energy for the bulk of the population \nliving in rural areas. Innovative approaches are required, such as using renewable energy. \n \n2.  The  lifetime  cost  of  renewable  energy  is  becoming  more  competitive  with  diesel \ngeneration as new technology and mass production bring down costs. New sources of funding \nsuch as carbon credits have become available and may be leveraged to bring down the cost of \nrenewable energy projects. Although petroleum prices have declined in recent months, they \nremain high by historical standards, and further price rises are likely once the world economy \nbegins to recover. Meanwhile, the uptake of renewable energy remains low.  \n \n3.  The Governments of PNG, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu have requested assistance \nfrom ADB to promote access to renewable energy. The concept paper for the proposed TA was \napproved on 20 October 2008. Fact-finding was conducted in Vanuatu on 11\u201317 November \n2008,  Solomon  Islands  on  8\u201312  December  2008,  and  PNG  on  2\u20136  February  2009.  The \ngovernments concur with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The experience of ADB TA for the Promotion of Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, \nand Greenhouse Gas Abatement Projects highlights the problems and pressing issues that \nhave faced renewable energy projects.2 These are (i) a focus on larger, more glamorous \ndevelopment  partner-driven  projects  at  the  expense  of  promising  smaller,  demand-driven \nproducts; (ii) a focus on engineering and technical issues at the expense of policy, social, and \ncommunity considerations; (iii) insufficient local ownership of donated products including agency \nsupport  for  backup  maintenance services  and  providing  spare  parts,  as  well as  a  lack of \ncommunity engagement generally; (iv) limited consideration of repair and maintenance costs \nand issues; and (v) insufficient regulations and guidelines for energy tariffs. Such lessons from \npast renewable energy projects globally and in the Pacific can be used to inform improved \nproject designs to address current energy challenges.  \n \n5.  The unreliability, poor coverage, and high cost of diesel power generation in Solomon \nIslands is a major constraint to private sector development and economic growth. Over 80% of \nthe rural population is without electricity. Blackouts are common. While many businesses and \ngovernment offices rely on standby generators, many small and medium-sized enterprises and \nmost  microenterprises  cannot  afford  this  option.  High  energy  costs  and  an  increasingly \nproblematic balance of payments have forced the Government to explore alternatives such as \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 6 April 2009. \n2 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for the Promotion of Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Greenhouse Gas \nAbatement Projects. Manila \n ", "2  \nimport  substitution  using  renewable  energy.  The  most  promising  solutions  to  the  energy \nproblem given the natural endowments of the country are hydropower, alternative fuels, and \nmini hydropower for provincial centers. \n \n6.  Similarly, PNG has made little progress in rural electrification in recent years. Rural \nelectrification  is  becoming  a  key government  priority,  with  power  likely  to  be added  to  its \nmedium-term development strategy. In particular, the Energy Division of the Department of \nPetroleum and Energy and PNG Power aim to rehabilitate and in some cases replace defunct \ndiesel generators in remote regional population centers and provide electricity in places not \npreviously electrified.  \n \n7.  Progress  has  been  slow  despite  high  renewable  energy  potential,  particularly  for \nhydropower and mini hydropower, throughout PNG. A uniform tariff across the country for \nelectric power has tended to discourage PNG Power from expanding electrification to less \nprofitable  rural  areas.  Another  difficulty  with  previous  projects  has  been  ensuring  that \nconsumers pay, which necessitates innovative solutions such as prepayment meters.  \n \n8.  In contrast with other Melanesian countries, Vanuatu has high-quality power supply to \nthe main urban centers of Port Vila and Louganville, albeit at high cost, but little electricity \nsupplied outside of these areas. To reduce costs and free up money for rural electrification, \nrenewable energy has been increasingly used to supply power to the grid. Unelco SUEZ, the \nurban concession holder, has integrated a small wind farm into the grid and is piloting coconut \nbiodiesel generator in provincial centers. The company has developed a rural electrification \nmaster plan for the Government, and savings from an externally funded hydropower scheme in \nSanto are being collected in a fund administered by the Government for providing power to rural \nareas. However, further work is required to render both the plan and the fund operational. The \nGovernment plans to provide additional support to on-grid renewable energy, and a solar farm \nand an additional wind farm for Port Vila are under active consideration. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be the increased use of sustainable, safe, reliable, affordable, \nand versatile renewable energy products by Pacific DMCs. The outcome will be the successful \ndemonstration of selected examples of such products and their readiness for replication and \nscaling up. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. The outputs of the TA will be \n(i)   the  completed  design  of  small  pilot  projects  for  testing  technology  and \nmanagement approaches in the first 8 months (phase 1) to be executed and \ncompleted under this TA in the second phase; \n(ii)   the completion in phase 2 of a number of pilot projects for mini hydropower in \nPNG, alternative fuels in Solomon Islands, and solar power in Vanuatu, and, \n(iii)   the completion of preparatory work for scaling up mini hydropower in PNG and \nSolomon Islands, alternative fuels in Solomon Islands, and renewable energy \nsources in Vanuatu in phase 2.  \n \n ", "  3\n11.  These outputs are based on careful consultation with Pacific DMC governments, and in \nresponse  to  direct  requests  from  them,  to  ensure  strong  local  buy-in  and  support  as \ndemonstrated by the memorandums of understanding agreed with the three countries during \nfact-finding.  Capacity  building  and  sustainability  have  been  emphasized  in  the  choice  and \ndesign  of  subprojects.  In  addition,  strong  national  consultant  support  will  supplement  the \ncapacity of the implementing agencies to implement the subprojects. While previous renewable \nenergy projects have been criticized for building pilot projects but not providing support to \nfollow-up work, preparatory work for replication and scaling up will be an integral part of the TA \ndesign. This support will take the form of feasibility studies, including due diligence assessments \nof existing studies as appropriate. A pipeline of potential projects will be developed based on the \nresults  of  the  pilot  projects,  which  ADB  may  finance  after  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance. Descriptions of each of the subcomponents by country are in paras 12\u201314. \n \n12.  In PNG, the TA will support a pilot project for mini hydropower development to supply \nelectricity to a remote rural population center. Diesel-fueled mini-grids have been installed in a \nnumber of these centers, but the high cost of diesel, problems transporting diesel to remote \nsites,  management  issues,  and  the  lack  of  maintenance  have  rendered  most  of  them \nnonfunctional. The TA will choose a rural population center with existing power distribution \ninfrastructure and replace the nonfunctioning diesel generator with hydropower generation. The \ninnovative features of this project in PNG are the use of hydropower in a remote setting and \nprepayment  meters.  The  TA  will  include  (i) support  for  designing  the  hydropower  system \nincluding the hydropower station itself and distribution, billing, maintenance, and management; \n(ii) installing the hydropower plant and distribution network where required; (iii) developing a \nsustainable business model; (iv) installing prepayment meters and developing a centralized \ncollection  system;  (v)  training  national  staff  to  manage  and  maintain  the  system;  and  (v) \ndeveloping  external  maintenance  contracts.  For  the  scaling-up  component,  the  TA  will \nundertake screening studies for 14 mini hydropower sites identified by the Government of PNG, \nselect 10 priority sites, and undertake prefeasibility studies and finance planning. Financing \nalternatives will then be assessed for implementation.  \n \n13.  In Solomon Islands, the TA will support the development of alternative fuels through a \npilot  project  potentially  including  (i)  retrofitting  an  existing  provincial  center  diesel-fueled \ngeneration system to run on alternative fuels, (ii) providing milling equipment and developing a \nsupply chain for the sustainable provision of alternative fuel, and (iii) developing a sustainable \nbusiness model, possibly including prepayment meters to improve system financial viability and \nefficient energy use. Support will be provided to scaling up renewable energy by (i) preparing \nfeasibility studies for a number of small projects for generating hydropower and power from \nalternative fuels in provincial centers and (ii) developing a financing program to support the \nimplementation of priority projects. \n \n14.  The  Government  of  Vanuatu  has  asked  ADB  to  support  development  of  on-grid \nrenewable energy to reduce the national dependence on imported diesel for power generation.  \nThe component will assist in the development of a solar farm to supply the Port Vila grid. The \ncomponent will include (i) development of feasibility studies, (ii) development of a pilot on-grid \nsolar project, and (iii) development of project financing options to upscale renewable energy for \non-grid supply. \n \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $3.6 million equivalent, of which $3.0 million equivalent will \nbe  financed  as  a  grant  by  the  Multi-Donor  Clean  Energy  Fund3  under  the  Clean  Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. The governments of PNG, Solomon \nIslands, and Vanuatu will provide an in-kind contribution of $600,000 equivalent, or $200,000 \neach. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Executing Agency will be the ADB Pacific Department, which will be responsible for \ncoordination. The implementing agencies for subprojects will be the (i) Energy Division of the \nDepartment of Petroleum and Energy in PNG; (ii) Energy Division of the Ministry of Mines, \nEnergy, and Rural Electrification in Solomon Islands; and (iii) Energy Unit of the Ministry of \nLand, Energy, Rural Water Supply, Geology, and Mines in Vanuatu. \n \n17.  The TA will have a term of 3 years from August 2009 to August 2012 and require 49 \nperson-months of international consultancy and 37 person-months of national consultancy. The \noutline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  3.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nConsulting firms will be requested to submit full technical proposals. The ratio for selection will \nbe 80% quality and 20% cost. It is anticipated that TA will be implemented under three separate \ncontracts with international consulting firms, one for each country, because of the variety of \ntasks to be carried out and the importance of country-specific experience when operating in \nchallenging environments such as rural PNG. Several workshops and seminars will be held \nunder the TA to provide training and build community awareness. Consulting firm contracts will \ncover the administration of seminar, workshop, and pilot project funds. Equipment and materials \nfor TA will be procured by the consultants or by ADB in accordance with ADB Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and remain with the implementing agencies \nfollowing  TA  completion.  The  proceeds  of  TA  will  be  disbursed in  line  with  the  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.4 Activities will be financed in PNG, Solomon Islands, or \nVanuatu under this TA only after a no-objection certificate is obtained from the government of \neach country. \n \n18.  The final report, including pilot project completion reports, country- and technology-\nspecific studies, and lessons learned, will be disseminated widely at regional conferences and \nother fora, as well as in the regional press. Jointly hosting the media at the TA commencement \nand  completion  events  will  ensure  that  people  in  Pacific  DMCs  are  informed  of  the  new \nrenewable energy products, delivery modes, possible financing arrangements, and lessons \nlearned. The TA will be subject to annual review by the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility secretariat. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n19.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nMulti-Donor Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for \nPromoting Access to Renewable Energy in the Pacific. \n                                                 \n3  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n4  ADB. 2008.
