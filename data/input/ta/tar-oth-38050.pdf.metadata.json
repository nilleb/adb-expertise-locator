Several  studies  on  gender  and  development  (GAD)  in  the  Central  Asia  republics \n(CARs)1 were conducted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the late 1990s.2 However, \ndue to the rapid economic transformation, which has some significant impact on women, it is \nessential to update the country gender assessment (CGA). The updated CGA will support the \nachievement of gender equity goals as stated in the millennium development goals (MDGs) and \nnational poverty reduction strategy (NPRS).3 The need for this regional technical assistance \n(TA) arises from the evidence that gender plays an important role in determining economic \ngrowth, poverty reduction, and development effectiveness.  The TA will cover four developing \nmember countries (DMCs): Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan.4   These \ncountries are experiencing similar political and economic transition, but have different levels of \npoverty and gender concerns.  The TA will assist the DMCs to integrate and address gender \nissues more consistently and systematically in planning and/or implementing the respective \nNPRS and country strategy and programs (CSPs), and strengthen the institutional capacity of \nthe government women\u2019s machinery for addressing GAD issues. Fact-finding for the TA was \nundertaken in Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan in March\u2013April 2004 to discuss with \nthe  governments  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  financing  and  implementation  arrangements.5   \nOther  key  stakeholders  who  were  consulted  included  representatives  of  civil  society  and \ndevelopment partners. The TA Framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Evidence is growing that gender-inclusive development strategies contribute significantly \nto economic growth, poverty reduction, as well as to equity objectives by ensuring that all \ngroups  of  beneficiaries  share  development  benefits.    Yet,  differences  between  men  and \nwomen\u2019s needs are often not fully recognized in poverty analysis and are frequently not taken \ninto consideration in designing and implementing of NPRSs and CSPs.   Poverty reduction \nstrategies  that  both  empower  women  to  enhance  their  capabilities  and  facilitate  their \nparticipation in economic, political, and social spheres are essential. \n \n3.  The CARs have a relatively gender-equal society, which is protected by laws, where \nwomen and men of all ages have similar access to activities in the economic, social, and \npolitical spheres.  In general, the transition has resulted in a significant fall in living standards for \nmost of the population in the CARs. The transition period has been accompanied by (i) a decline \nin  production;  (ii)  an  increase  in  unemployment,  declining  the  standard  of  living;  and  (iii) \nincreasing income differentiation and inequalities.   \n \n4.  While both men and women have experienced growing poverty, unemployment, and \nweakening social support and social services, the economic and social costs of the transition \nclearly  weigh  heavily  on  women.    For  instance,  the  decline  of  the  health  and  education \nsystem\u2014sectors traditionally dominated by women\u2014has meant a reduction in income and loss \n                                                 \n1  Henceforth, in this document we will, unless otherwise specified, use the terms \u2018Central Asia or Central Asia \nrepublics or CARs interchangeably to refer to the four countries viz. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and \nTajikistan all of which are members of the Asian Development Bank.  The discussion in the main text therefore \ncovers four countries. \n2  ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n3  NPRS is a framework for implementing the government\u2019s development agenda. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 10 February 2004. \n5  The governments of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan have sent no-objection letters for the \nproposed TA.  During the Fact-Finding Mission, the Government of Uzbekistan declined to participate in the TA.   \n ", " 2  \nof employment for many women. Likewise, there are widening inequalities in access to health \ncare services that are disproportionately used by women and children.  The balance between \nwomen\u2019s roles in the public and private spheres appears to be changing and many of the \nadvances in gender equality that were gained under the former Soviet Union (FSU) system are \nnow at risk.   \n \n5.  At the household level, the major consequences of poverty include increased alcoholism \nleading to domestic violence against women, malnutrition, worsening health status, increased \nincidence of HIV/AIDS,6 out-migration, commercial sexual activities, human trafficking leading to \nsocial fragmentation and social exclusion.  Positive aspects of the transition were identified, \nsuch as women gaining the opportunity to start their own business.  However, they were \nconstrained by lack of capital and access to credit, and lack of information and knowledge on \nhow to start a business\u2013 all of which hinder women\u2019s participation in entrepreneurial activities.7   \nAt the macro level, major areas of concern include (i) the process of labor market deregulation \nand the related growth in inequalities in earnings experienced across the region, (ii) women\u2019s \nperceived  disadvantage  in  participating  in  the  process  of  privatization  and  economic \nliberalization, and  (iii) the gender gap in access to credit. \n \n6.  As  a  result  of  shrinking  income,  increasing  unemployment,  and  an  eroding  social \nprotection system, the incidence of poverty is rapidly growing, specifically among vulnerable \ngroups. In Azerbaijan, 49% of the population live in poverty.8 The economic decline affected \nwomen more adversely than it did men. Women are more vulnerable on the labor market due to \nthe high percentage of women working in such sectors as health, social welfare, and education, \nwhich have been adversely affected by the economic transition. A large number of women \nparticipate in political parties, however, they usually occupy secondary technical positions.  \n \n7.  The social and economic costs of the transition in Kazakhstan have been immense.  By \nthe end of 2002, approximately 26.4% of the population were living below the poverty line.9  A \n1996 Government survey on working conditions showed that women comprised 60% of the \nunemployed  and  nearly  80%  of  the  long-term  unemployed.    Since  independence,  female \nrepresentation in political positions has decreased.  Wherein the past up to 30% of the seats in \nparliament were reserved for women, that percentage dropped to under 10% in the 1996 \nparliament (footnote 2). \n \n8.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  regional  differences  in  poverty  are  very  large  and  striking. \nDeterminants of poverty include level of participation in the labor market. The situation of \nwomen in the labor market is worse than that of men. Women are at least 1.5 times more likely \nto be unemployed than men because the sectors in which women tended to be employed in the \nFSU have been retrenched more than those in which men worked.10 A similar phenomenon is \nobserved in terms of the insufficient representation of women in government and management \npositions.  Women in management positions are less than 30%, and they account for less than \n20% of all owners of enterprises and peasants\u2019 farms.11  Furthermore, social and economic \nproblems, as well as poverty, reduce the level of women\u2019s safety.   \n                                                 \n6  HIV/AIDS = Human immunodeficiency virus/Acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \n7  Sasser, B. 2001.

The economic transition in Tajikistan has also resulted in the discontinuation of many \nstate  structures  and  benefits  that  supported  women  in  combining  their  productive  and \nreproductive roles.  In 2003, it was estimated that 68% of the people lived below the poverty line \nand  that  a  third  of  the  economically  active  population  were  unemployed.  In  contrast  to \nelsewhere in the FSU, women\u2019s formal labor market participation in Tajikistan has fallen below \nthat of men\u2019s. However, women remain concentrated in the lowest paid sectors of agriculture, \neducation, and health where wages are below the national average.  Since independence, there \nhas been a dramatic change in the gender balance in politics.  The number of women in \nparliament  and  senior  posts  within  the  government  at  the  central  and  regional  levels  has \ndecreased substantially. \n \n10.  In summary, the transition is affecting men and women differently, partly because of \nexisting gender roles and stereotypes based on tradition, religion, and a patriarchal way of life \nand thinking, gender disparities in the labor market, decreased provision of social services and \nsocial protection, and women's participation in decision making.  To prevent the deterioration of \nwomen\u2019s  social  and  economic  status,  protect  families  particularly  vulnerable  groups,  and \npromote gender equity, governments in the CARs have developed and implemented coherent \nnational GAD policies. Due to the weak institutional capacity of women\u2019s machinery in the CARs \nand lack of understanding of the GAD concept as a crosscutting issue, there is a critical need to \ndevelop  the  capacity  of  government's  women  machinery,  line  ministries  and  civil  society \norganizations working on implementation of the national gender action plan in government. \n \n11.  In supporting governments to achieve NPRS and the MDGs, particularly in relation to \npromoting gender equality, ADB has been integrating gender issues more consistently into its \npolicy dialogue, projects, and programs. Gender mainstreaming in ADB\u2019s CSPs will increase the \nopportunities for improving the poverty reduction impact, i.e., by making ADB\u2019s interventions \nmore responsive to country gender conditions and commitments; making the intervention more \nstrategic; and improving the alignment of ADB policies, process, and resources to support such \ninterventions. The TA is particularly timely, as it will formulate a gender strategy for Azerbaijan \nfor 2005 and will provide critical inputs to the CSP updates in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and \nTajikistan. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The TA aims to contribute to the poverty reduction goal of four selected CARs by \nsupporting  their  governments  in  identifying  key  gender  issues  for  poverty  reduction  and \nstrengthening their capacities to implement the GAD strategies.   The objectives are to improve \nthe quality of NPRS by identifying and implementing policies and programs that will benefit both \nmen and women and maximize potential benefits for the poor.  The key outputs are (i) DMCs \nassessment of the gender dimensions of poverty and development of strategic interventions to \naddress those dimensions, (ii) interventions for potential ADB financing to address the gender \ndimensions  of  poverty,  (iii)  strategic  papers  on  gender,  and  (iv)  strengthened  capacity  of \ngovernments of the DMCs to monitor and evaluate gender impacts and ADB's poverty reduction \nstrategy.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will assist the DMCs to assess the gender dimensions of poverty by conducting \nCGA. The CGA is the principal means by which ADB and the borrowing countries participate in \n ", " 4  \na collaborative process to analyze the gender dimensions of poverty; identify gender-responsive \npolicies and action important for poverty reduction; and integrate these strategies and actions \ninto the DMCs strategy for poverty reduction.   The TA will have the following activities:  \n \n(i)  Participatory  gender  assessment.  Participatory  gender  assessment  focuses  on \nunderstanding and documenting the differences in gender roles, activities, needs, and \nopportunities in a given context. Through a participatory process, this assessment will \nprovide  a  profile  of  (a)  the  different  roles  of  males  and  females,  including  their \nparticipation in both the market and household economies; (b) gender disparities in \naccess to, control over, and use of assets and productive resources; (c) gender \ndisparities  in  human  development  indicators;  (d)  inequalities  between  males  and \nfemales in the ability to participate in development decision making at local and \nnational  levels;  and  (e)  laws,  institutional  frameworks,  norms,  and  other  societal \npractices that lead (explicitly or implicitly) to gender discrimination and/or gender \ninequality.  A CGA (outlined in Appendix 2) will be prepared for each country. Its \npreparation will involve all key stakeholders through participatory gender assessment, \npublic consultations, and workshops. The paper will be published subsequently as a \nstand-alone ADB publication and distributed.  \n \n(ii)  Policies and institutional analysis. The assessment will (a) review the country \ncontext, including its policies, priorities, legal and regulatory framework, institutional \narrangements for implementing its gender and development goals for MDGs and \nNPRS; (b) review the gender dimensions of ADB\u2019s portfolio of ongoing projects in the \ncountry; and (c) provide a set of suggested gender-responsive priority policy and \noperational  interventions  that  the  evidence  indicates  are  important  for  poverty \nreduction. A country gender strategy (CGS) paper will be prepared for each country. \nA  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  for  tracking  and  evaluating  gender \nmainstreaming in MDGs, NPRS, and CSP will also be developed.  \n \n(iii)  National workshop. Dialogue with the government and other stakeholders to identify \npolicy and operational interventions for mainstreaming gender into the NPRS will be \nconducted through public consultations and in-country workshops.  \n \n(iv)  Regional  workshop.    A  regional  workshop  will  be  held  in  one  of  the  countries \ncovered by the TA.  The workshop will provide opportunities for dialogue, cross-\ncountry sharing of experiences and lessons, exchange of strategies in integrating \ngender in the NPRS and the CSP. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $410,000 equivalent.  The Cooperation Fund in \nSupport of the Formulation and Implementation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies will \nfund the TA for $350,000 equivalent on a grant basis.12 The remaining $60,000 equivalent will \nbe contributed by the governments of the four participating countries in kind and will cover office \nspace and counterpart staff remuneration.  ADB will administer the TA. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months. It is expected to begin in July 2004 and end \n                                                 \n12 The TA was endorsed at the 3rd Strategy Meeting for NPRS on 28\u201330 July 2003 in Manila. ", "      5\nin March 2005.  Consultants\u2019 inputs will amount to 24 person-months: 16 for four domestic \nconsultants  and  8  for  two  international  consultants.  Two  international  gender  and  poverty \nreduction specialists will be responsible for coordination; organizing research, consultations, \nsupervising the country-level consultants; and producing the inception, interim, and final reports \nfor four countries and one regional gender assessment report. Each international consultant will \nbe  responsible  for  preparing  gender  briefing  and  strategy  papers,  facilitating  country-level \ndiscussions, and organizing a national workshop for two countries as well as preparing a \nregional workshop and a regional gender strategy paper. Four domestic consultants, specialists \nin gender and participatory development (4 person-months for each country), will assist the \ninternational consultants in preparing  gender briefing and strategy papers, facilitate country-\nlevel  discussions,  and  organize  a  national  workshop.    The  consultants  will  be  selected \nindividually and  engaged by ADB according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements for engaging domestic consultants. Appendix 4 gives the outline terms of \nreference for the consultants.    \n \n16.  The Social Sector Division of the East and Central Asia Department will execute the TA, \nin consultation with the concerned resident missions.  At the country level, the consultant will \nwork with the country GAD working group, which will be established before the TA starts.  The \nworking groups, which will be established one in each participating country, will be chaired by a \nnational women\u2019s committee as a focal point for the TA in each participating country and will \ncomprise representatives from Ministry of Finance, Women\u2019s Committee, executing agencies for \nfuture and ADB ongoing projects, and prominent nongovernment organizations (NGOs) working \non gender. The composition of the working group may vary from country to country. The \nconsultants in collaboration with the government\u2019s focal point in each country will supervise and \nfacilitate all these processes. \n \n17.  The consultants will submit short two-monthly progress reports summarizing project \nactivities, issues, and constraints for the duration of the TA.  In addition, four major reports will \nbe submitted: (i) an inception report, including a work plan for the TA, within 3 weeks after the \nTA starts; (ii) individual country reports, which will be discussed at the country workshop 4 \nmonths after inception; (iii) draft final report of CGAs and/or CGSs to be presented in  the \ncountry workshops and the regional workshop; and (iv) a final report from each country after \ncomments are received from its government and ADB.  Equipment items such as computers \nand printers will be procured by consultants under arrangements satisfactory to ADB and turned \nover to the Government's focal point at the end of the consulting arrangements. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance, not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Cooperation Fund in Support of the Formulation and Implementation of \nNational  Poverty  Reduction  Strategies  for  Mainstreaming  Gender  into  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategies in Four Central Asia Republics, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "", "", "8  Appendix 2 \n \nOUTLINE OF THE COUNTRY GENDER ASSESSMENT \n(Draft Table of Contents) \n \nExecutive Summary \n \nBackground and Rationale of the Assessment \n(Asian  Development  Bank  strategic  objectives  and  gender  and  development  policy, \ncountry and strategy program for the country, objectives of the study, the process, and \nintended use, etc.) \n \nI.
