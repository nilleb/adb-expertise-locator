The 1997 Country Program for Sri Lanka includes project preparatory technical\nassistance (TA) to help the Government's Road Development Authority (RDA) prepare a project\nto augment the capacity of the 160 kilometer (km) road transport corridor between the capital,\nColombo, and the southern area of the country, which is centered on the port city of Galle, capital\nof the country's Southern Province. A Bank TA Fact-finding Mission visited Sn Lanka from 9 to 27\nJune 1997 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, costs,\nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference, for the TA.1\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Government has targeted the country's southern region, which consists\npredominately of the Southern Province, as one of several economically weak parts of Sri Lanka\nwhere development initiatives can be taken without waiting for the protracted civil war to end.2\nThese initiatives focus on stimulating economic growth and reducing unemployment and poverty.\nTo give coherence to this policy, the Government formed the Presidential Task Force for\nSouthern Area Development in 1995, which became the Southern Development Authority in\n1996. The Authority's main mandate is to attract investment in the Southern Area, but it also has\nstatutory powers to direct development activities with Presidential approval.\n3. A master plan for the development of the Southern Area was prepared in 1995/96\nwith assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency. The master plan is intended to\nprovide a strategy for economic growth in the South and advocates, among other things,\nstrengthening the links to Colombo and improving access to inland areas and the southeast dry\nzone. The master plan identifies many potential development projects, one of the most important\nbeing improved road connections from the southern area to Colombo, by the coastal corridor, and\nalso by an existing but yet to be improved central route. Preparation of the master plan and\nestablishment of the Southern Development Authority reflect the Government's determination to\nrealize economic growth in the south. Fundamental to the success of many of the coriomic and\nsocial development projects proposed for the southern region is the need to ensure that basic\ninfrastructure facilities are available to avoid bottlenecks to development. The TA reflects this\naspect of the master plan strategy.\n4. Southern Province, one of the country's nine provinces, covers nearly 5,500 km2,\nabout 8.4 percent of the country. The population is approximately 2.2 million, making it the\ncountry's second most densely populated province. About 20 percent of the population live in\nurban areas, including Galle (the provincial capital and district center, with a population of\n100,000), Matara and l-ambantota towns (the other district centers) and four other towns.\nUnemployment, underemployment, and poverty rates are high throughout the province and are\nseen by the Government as key concerns that must be addressed.\n5. The coast road is the primary access to Southern Province from Colombo, its port,\nthe country's only international airport, and the economically advanced western province centered\non Colombo. This road is one of the country's two most heavily trafficked intercity rpad links, the\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 1996.\n2\t\nOne such initiative is the proposed Bank-financed Southern Provincial Roads Project, for whrch a loan of\n$30.0 million is being processed for Board consideration in October 1997.", "other being the Colombo to Kandy highway. Although the coast road has been rehabilitated over\nthe past few years with World Bank and Korean Government assistance, it remains very narrow,\nseverely congested, and subject to extensive ribbon development over much of its length. Its\ncapacity cannot be increased significantly where this development exists, at least on its present\nalignment, without very substantial land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. Even were this\nacquisition and resettlement possible (extremely difficult in Sri Lanka), the widened road would\ncontinue to pass through densely populated areas. With greater volumes of traffic moving at\nhigher speed, the safety and environmental conditions in these areas would deteriorate further.\n6. The Government is aware of the need for increased primary road capacity between\nColombo and the south, but it is equally aware that social and environmental considerations\nprevent this capacity from being delivered through significant improvement to the existing coast\nroad, at least along those lengths that pass through urban areas. To resolve this situation, RDA\nhas studied a possible inland route for a new southern highway, and completed some detailed\nengineering for it. The study was primarily engineering in nature, with only limited financial,\neconomic, traffic, environmental, or social content. Subsequently, the Government equested the\nBank to consider financing construction of the new highway, since it is an important element of\nthe Government's southern area development strategy. The Bank advised the Government that it\nwished to undertake a more comprehensive study of capacity-enhancing alternatives that would\ntake into account the economic, financial, environmental, and social aspects that the earlier\nstudies had not fully addressed. Further, the Bank-assisted study would look at the corridor as a\nwhole, meaning the existing coast road and a new inland alignment. The study would examine all\nreasonable options for meeting future traffic demand, possibly including specific improvements to\nthe existing road, bypasses of major urban areas, some dual-caniageway sections, and some\nlengths of new road on a new alignment. The outcome of the study would be an investment plan\nphased over time, based on traffic forecasts, economic and flnancial analyses. and social and\nenvironmental considerations.\n7. In formulating its new alignment proposal, the Government had also given some\nconsideration to it being implemented through a build-operate-transfer or similar approach. The\nBank study will examine the scope for private sector involvement in appropriate components of\nthe corridors capacity-enhancing works. In addition to a full private sector option, the study will\nalso include a detailed examination of toll options, with the objectives of (i) introducing the\nconcept of 'user pays\" for transport services; (ii) developing an understanding of the legislative,\nlegal, and regulatory constraints within which a toll road would have to operate, or developing\nchanges in those constraints if these are found to be necessary; and (iii) generating sufficient\nrevenues to fund operation, maintenance, and possibly debt-servicing obligations for appropriate\nsections of new road. Concerning the related issue of managing the new road sections, the study\nwill also assist the Government with developing frontage access control legislation or regulations,\nto ensure that the facility continues to operate as a high-speed high capacity road link without the\nribbon development-induced congestion that so impacts on the capacity of the existing coastal\nroad, and on most other similar links in the country's highway network.\n8. The Bank's long-term strategy in Sri Lanka is to promote broad-based and\nsustainable development that leads to poverty reduction and more balaried regional\ndevelopment. The strategy has a particular focus on the southern area of the country. The Bank's\ninvolvement in the Southern Transport Corridor Project is consistent with the strategy, and also\nsupports the Government's efforts to develop effective transport linkages between Colombo and\nthe less advantaged southern area.", "THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n9. The objective of the TA is to assist the Government with preparing a time-based\ninvestment plan for improving the primary road system in the southern transport corridor, to\nincrease its capacity in line with projected demand. The plan will include two separate elements:\n(i) a medium-temi (10-year) firm investment plan from which the Bank could develop an\ninvestment project; and (ii) a longer term strategy for subsequent development of the primary\nroad network in the corridor that could, after refinement towards the end of the medium-term plan\nperiod, form the basis for further external or Government-financed projects. The-projects that will\nbe developed from the medium-term investment plan will maximize to the extent possible\ninvolvement of the private sector.\nB.\t Scope\n10. The TA will include five broad types of activities, which are described in more detail\nin the summary terms of reference in Appendix 1. All of the activities will take into account the\nwork already done by RDA.\n11. Economic and financial activities will include traffic and traffic diversion studies, toll\nand private sector studies, and economic and financial analyses. Technical activities will include\nroad capacity and axle load studies; alignment studies; and preparation of alignment, pavement,\nand structural designs in sufficient detail to provide reliable costs for the economic and financial\nanalyses. Environmental impact activities will include initial environmental examinations, the\noutputs of WhiCh will be taken into account in the selection of suitable improvement options.\nSocial impact activities will include social impact surveys (land requirement. involuntary\nresethement, etc.) for the various improvement options. The survey outputs will be used as an\nimportant input into the selection of the improvement options, so as to reduce land acquisition\nand involuntary resettlement to the extent possible. Policy and institutional activitie will be based\non the outcome of the toll and private sector studies, and will include an analysis of options for\nmanaging the road investments in the corridor. These options may include, for new lengths of\nhighway specifically, (i) a full private-sector operation; (ii) a Government-managed toll facility, with\ntoll levels set to recover at least operation and maintenance costs; and (iii) a conventional\nGovernment-operated free-to-user facility. This component of the TA will also include assistance\nto the Government with developing or amending legislation to control frontage development along\nthe new lengths of road.\n12. The TA's principal outputs will be\n(i) a time-based investment plan for road investments in the southern transport\ncorridor, to increase the corridor's capacity in line with projected traffic demand; the\nplan will include two separate elements: (i) a medium-term (10-year) firm\ninvestment plan from which the Bank could develop an investment project; and (ii)\na longer term strategy for the remainder of the corridor, which' with detailed\nrefinement towards the end of the medium-term plan period, could form the basis\nfor further external and/or Government-financed projects: and\n(ii)\t detailed scope of work, terms of reference, and cost estimates, for the subsequent\ninvestment project, to include detailed engineering; environmental impact analysis;", "4\nsocial impact analysis and preparation of resettlement action plans; assistance with\nprocurement of civil works contractors; and, if the private- sector option proves to\nbe feasible, appropriate assistance to the Government with preparing suitable\ncomponents of the project for private sector investment.\nC..\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The estimated total cost of the TA is $1,200,000 equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange component is $759,000 and the local currency component is $441,000 equivalent (see\ndetailed estimate in Appendix 2). The Government has requested the Bank to finance $1,000,000\nequivalent, of which the foreign exchange component will be $741,000 and the local currency\ncomponent will be $259,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis\nfrom the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide\nthe remaining $200,000 equivalent in the form of social and environmental impact surveys;\npavement roughness, traffic, and other surveys; furnished office space in Colombo; counterpart\nstaff; telephone (local communications only); maps; reports; etc. The Government has been\ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit the Bank to financing a subsequent project.\nE.\t Implementation Arrangements\n14. Overall management of the TA will be the responsibility of a Project Steering\nCommittee, which will consist of representatives of the Ministry of Finance and Planning (External\nResources Department [ERD]) and the Ministry of Transport and Highways (MOTH), the Southern\nDevelopment Authority, the Board of Investment, and other agencies as appropriate. RDA, which\nwill also be a member of the Committee, will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Within RDA, the\nDirector of Engineering Services will be the Project Director, and will be responsible for the TAs\noverall implementation. The Project Director will provide or arrange, as appropriate, the technical\nservices and surveys referred to in para. 13. The Project Director will also ensure that RDA and\nthe TA consultants interact with the Southern Development Authority, and other relevant\nGovemment agencies, during TA implementation.\n15. RDA will also appoint a full-time Project Manager to manage the TA on a day-to-\nday basis. The Project Manager, who will report to the Project Director and will be provided by\nRDA with appropriate support staff and facilities, will have experience in successfully managing\nprojects of this importance, magnitude, and complexity. The Project Manager may be an RDA\nofficer or may be engaged specifically by RDA for this purpose from the private sector. RDA will\nprovide the Bank with the name, experience, and other details of the proposed Project Manager\nfor its review and approval before RDA formally appoints the nominee to the position, and before\nthe Bank enters into a contract with the consulting firm selected to undertake the TA.\n16. The consulting services for the TA will require about 27 person-months of\ninternational specialists, with expertise in feasibility studies; economic and financial analysis; toll\nstudies; private sector involvement in infrastructure projects; highway, materials and pavement\nengineering; environmental and social impact analyses; and land use planning in the context of\ntransport sector developments. The TA will also require about 43 person-months of senior\ndomestic consultants, with generally similar expertise, with the exception of the toll and private\nsector studies. The consultants will be selected by the Bank in accordance with its  Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants. and other arrangements acceptable to the Bank for the engagement of\ndomestic consultants. The terms of reference for the consulting services are given in Appendix 1.", "5\n17. The TA consultants are expected to mobilize in Colombo in the second week of\nJanuary 1998. The services will be completed in September 1998. Depending on the outcome of\nthe TA, the ensuing engineering studies will either be implemented as a component of the\nproposed Road Network Improvement Project, or will be processed as a separate TA\n(engineering) loan. Assuming the TA is completed on schedule, the engineering studies could\ncommence in early 1999.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n18. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Democratic\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 for the\npurpose of the Southern Transport Corridor Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, Page 1\nSUMMARY TERMS OF REFERENCE\nA,\t Scope\nThe scope of the Technical Assistance (TA) will include:\n(i) reviewing existing studies and proposals prepared by the Road Development\nAuthority (RDA) and others;\n(ii) overseeing traffic, pavement condition and roughness, social impact, and other\nsurveys that RDA is to undertake as part of the Government's contribution to the\nTA, to ensure that they are carried out appropriately and that they produce results\nthat can be used reliably as inputs for the TA's various activities;\n(iii) developing forecasts of (a) traffic growth rates in the study corridor, based on the\ncountry's projected economic growth;

The 1997 Country Program for Sri Lanka includes project preparatory technical\nassistance (TA) to help the Government's Road Development Authority (RDA) prepare a project\nto augment the capacity of the 160 kilometer (km) road transport corridor between the capital,\nColombo, and the southern area of the country, which is centered on the port city of Galle, capital\nof the country's Southern Province. A Bank TA Fact-finding Mission visited Sn Lanka from 9 to 27\nJune 1997 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, costs,\nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference, for the TA.1\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Government has targeted the country's southern region, which consists\npredominately of the Southern Province, as one of several economically weak parts of Sri Lanka\nwhere development initiatives can be taken without waiting for the protracted civil war to end.2\nThese initiatives focus on stimulating economic growth and reducing unemployment and poverty.\nTo give coherence to this policy, the Government formed the Presidential Task Force for\nSouthern Area Development in 1995, which became the Southern Development Authority in\n1996. The Authority's main mandate is to attract investment in the Southern Area, but it also has\nstatutory powers to direct development activities with Presidential approval.\n3. A master plan for the development of the Southern Area was prepared in 1995/96\nwith assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency. The master plan is intended to\nprovide a strategy for economic growth in the South and advocates, among other things,\nstrengthening the links to Colombo and improving access to inland areas and the southeast dry\nzone. The master plan identifies many potential development projects, one of the most important\nbeing improved road connections from the southern area to Colombo, by the coastal corridor, and\nalso by an existing but yet to be improved central route. Preparation of the master plan and\nestablishment of the Southern Development Authority reflect the Government's determination to\nrealize economic growth in the south. Fundamental to the success of many of the coriomic and\nsocial development projects proposed for the southern region is the need to ensure that basic\ninfrastructure facilities are available to avoid bottlenecks to development. The TA reflects this\naspect of the master plan strategy.\n4. Southern Province, one of the country's nine provinces, covers nearly 5,500 km2,\nabout 8.4 percent of the country. The population is approximately 2.2 million, making it the\ncountry's second most densely populated province. About 20 percent of the population live in\nurban areas, including Galle (the provincial capital and district center, with a population of\n100,000), Matara and l-ambantota towns (the other district centers) and four other towns.\nUnemployment, underemployment, and poverty rates are high throughout the province and are\nseen by the Government as key concerns that must be addressed.\n5. The coast road is the primary access to Southern Province from Colombo, its port,\nthe country's only international airport, and the economically advanced western province centered\non Colombo. This road is one of the country's two most heavily trafficked intercity rpad links, the\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 1996.\n2\t\nOne such initiative is the proposed Bank-financed Southern Provincial Roads Project, for whrch a loan of\n$30.0 million is being processed for Board consideration in October 1997.", "other being the Colombo to Kandy highway. Although the coast road has been rehabilitated over\nthe past few years with World Bank and Korean Government assistance, it remains very narrow,\nseverely congested, and subject to extensive ribbon development over much of its length. Its\ncapacity cannot be increased significantly where this development exists, at least on its present\nalignment, without very substantial land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. Even were this\nacquisition and resettlement possible (extremely difficult in Sri Lanka), the widened road would\ncontinue to pass through densely populated areas. With greater volumes of traffic moving at\nhigher speed, the safety and environmental conditions in these areas would deteriorate further.\n6. The Government is aware of the need for increased primary road capacity between\nColombo and the south, but it is equally aware that social and environmental considerations\nprevent this capacity from being delivered through significant improvement to the existing coast\nroad, at least along those lengths that pass through urban areas. To resolve this situation, RDA\nhas studied a possible inland route for a new southern highway, and completed some detailed\nengineering for it. The study was primarily engineering in nature, with only limited financial,\neconomic, traffic, environmental, or social content. Subsequently, the Government equested the\nBank to consider financing construction of the new highway, since it is an important element of\nthe Government's southern area development strategy. The Bank advised the Government that it\nwished to undertake a more comprehensive study of capacity-enhancing alternatives that would\ntake into account the economic, financial, environmental, and social aspects that the earlier\nstudies had not fully addressed. Further, the Bank-assisted study would look at the corridor as a\nwhole, meaning the existing coast road and a new inland alignment. The study would examine all\nreasonable options for meeting future traffic demand, possibly including specific improvements to\nthe existing road, bypasses of major urban areas, some dual-caniageway sections, and some\nlengths of new road on a new alignment. The outcome of the study would be an investment plan\nphased over time, based on traffic forecasts, economic and flnancial analyses. and social and\nenvironmental considerations.\n7. In formulating its new alignment proposal, the Government had also given some\nconsideration to it being implemented through a build-operate-transfer or similar approach. The\nBank study will examine the scope for private sector involvement in appropriate components of\nthe corridors capacity-enhancing works. In addition to a full private sector option, the study will\nalso include a detailed examination of toll options, with the objectives of (i) introducing the\nconcept of 'user pays\" for transport services; (ii) developing an understanding of the legislative,\nlegal, and regulatory constraints within which a toll road would have to operate, or developing\nchanges in those constraints if these are found to be necessary; and (iii) generating sufficient\nrevenues to fund operation, maintenance, and possibly debt-servicing obligations for appropriate\nsections of new road. Concerning the related issue of managing the new road sections, the study\nwill also assist the Government with developing frontage access control legislation or regulations,\nto ensure that the facility continues to operate as a high-speed high capacity road link without the\nribbon development-induced congestion that so impacts on the capacity of the existing coastal\nroad, and on most other similar links in the country's highway network.\n8. The Bank's long-term strategy in Sri Lanka is to promote broad-based and\nsustainable development that leads to poverty reduction and more balaried regional\ndevelopment. The strategy has a particular focus on the southern area of the country. The Bank's\ninvolvement in the Southern Transport Corridor Project is consistent with the strategy, and also\nsupports the Government's efforts to develop effective transport linkages between Colombo and\nthe less advantaged southern area.", "THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n9. The objective of the TA is to assist the Government with preparing a time-based\ninvestment plan for improving the primary road system in the southern transport corridor, to\nincrease its capacity in line with projected demand. The plan will include two separate elements:\n(i) a medium-temi (10-year) firm investment plan from which the Bank could develop an\ninvestment project; and (ii) a longer term strategy for subsequent development of the primary\nroad network in the corridor that could, after refinement towards the end of the medium-term plan\nperiod, form the basis for further external or Government-financed projects. The-projects that will\nbe developed from the medium-term investment plan will maximize to the extent possible\ninvolvement of the private sector.\nB.\t Scope\n10. The TA will include five broad types of activities, which are described in more detail\nin the summary terms of reference in Appendix 1. All of the activities will take into account the\nwork already done by RDA.\n11. Economic and financial activities will include traffic and traffic diversion studies, toll\nand private sector studies, and economic and financial analyses. Technical activities will include\nroad capacity and axle load studies; alignment studies; and preparation of alignment, pavement,\nand structural designs in sufficient detail to provide reliable costs for the economic and financial\nanalyses. Environmental impact activities will include initial environmental examinations, the\noutputs of WhiCh will be taken into account in the selection of suitable improvement options.\nSocial impact activities will include social impact surveys (land requirement. involuntary\nresethement, etc.) for the various improvement options. The survey outputs will be used as an\nimportant input into the selection of the improvement options, so as to reduce land acquisition\nand involuntary resettlement to the extent possible. Policy and institutional activitie will be based\non the outcome of the toll and private sector studies, and will include an analysis of options for\nmanaging the road investments in the corridor. These options may include, for new lengths of\nhighway specifically, (i) a full private-sector operation; (ii) a Government-managed toll facility, with\ntoll levels set to recover at least operation and maintenance costs; and (iii) a conventional\nGovernment-operated free-to-user facility. This component of the TA will also include assistance\nto the Government with developing or amending legislation to control frontage development along\nthe new lengths of road.\n12. The TA's principal outputs will be\n(i) a time-based investment plan for road investments in the southern transport\ncorridor, to increase the corridor's capacity in line with projected traffic demand; the\nplan will include two separate elements: (i) a medium-term (10-year) firm\ninvestment plan from which the Bank could develop an investment project; and (ii)\na longer term strategy for the remainder of the corridor, which' with detailed\nrefinement towards the end of the medium-term plan period, could form the basis\nfor further external and/or Government-financed projects: and\n(ii)\t detailed scope of work, terms of reference, and cost estimates, for the subsequent\ninvestment project, to include detailed engineering; environmental impact analysis;", "4\nsocial impact analysis and preparation of resettlement action plans; assistance with\nprocurement of civil works contractors; and, if the private- sector option proves to\nbe feasible, appropriate assistance to the Government with preparing suitable\ncomponents of the project for private sector investment.\nC..\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The estimated total cost of the TA is $1,200,000 equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange component is $759,000 and the local currency component is $441,000 equivalent (see\ndetailed estimate in Appendix 2). The Government has requested the Bank to finance $1,000,000\nequivalent, of which the foreign exchange component will be $741,000 and the local currency\ncomponent will be $259,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis\nfrom the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide\nthe remaining $200,000 equivalent in the form of social and environmental impact surveys;\npavement roughness, traffic, and other surveys; furnished office space in Colombo; counterpart\nstaff; telephone (local communications only); maps; reports; etc. The Government has been\ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit the Bank to financing a subsequent project.\nE.\t Implementation Arrangements\n14. Overall management of the TA will be the responsibility of a Project Steering\nCommittee, which will consist of representatives of the Ministry of Finance and Planning (External\nResources Department [ERD]) and the Ministry of Transport and Highways (MOTH), the Southern\nDevelopment Authority, the Board of Investment, and other agencies as appropriate. RDA, which\nwill also be a member of the Committee, will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Within RDA, the\nDirector of Engineering Services will be the Project Director, and will be responsible for the TAs\noverall implementation. The Project Director will provide or arrange, as appropriate, the technical\nservices and surveys referred to in para. 13. The Project Director will also ensure that RDA and\nthe TA consultants interact with the Southern Development Authority, and other relevant\nGovemment agencies, during TA implementation.\n15. RDA will also appoint a full-time Project Manager to manage the TA on a day-to-\nday basis. The Project Manager, who will report to the Project Director and will be provided by\nRDA with appropriate support staff and facilities, will have experience in successfully managing\nprojects of this importance, magnitude, and complexity. The Project Manager may be an RDA\nofficer or may be engaged specifically by RDA for this purpose from the private sector. RDA will\nprovide the Bank with the name, experience, and other details of the proposed Project Manager\nfor its review and approval before RDA formally appoints the nominee to the position, and before\nthe Bank enters into a contract with the consulting firm selected to undertake the TA.\n16. The consulting services for the TA will require about 27 person-months of\ninternational specialists, with expertise in feasibility studies; economic and financial analysis; toll\nstudies; private sector involvement in infrastructure projects; highway, materials and pavement\nengineering; environmental and social impact analyses; and land use planning in the context of\ntransport sector developments. The TA will also require about 43 person-months of senior\ndomestic consultants, with generally similar expertise, with the exception of the toll and private\nsector studies. The consultants will be selected by the Bank in accordance with its  Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants. and other arrangements acceptable to the Bank for the engagement of\ndomestic consultants. The terms of reference for the consulting services are given in Appendix 1.", "5\n17. The TA consultants are expected to mobilize in Colombo in the second week of\nJanuary 1998. The services will be completed in September 1998. Depending on the outcome of\nthe TA, the ensuing engineering studies will either be implemented as a component of the\nproposed Road Network Improvement Project, or will be processed as a separate TA\n(engineering) loan. Assuming the TA is completed on schedule, the engineering studies could\ncommence in early 1999.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n18. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Democratic\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 for the\npurpose of the Southern Transport Corridor Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, Page 1\nSUMMARY TERMS OF REFERENCE\nA,\t Scope\nThe scope of the Technical Assistance (TA) will include:\n(i) reviewing existing studies and proposals prepared by the Road Development\nAuthority (RDA) and others;\n(ii) overseeing traffic, pavement condition and roughness, social impact, and other\nsurveys that RDA is to undertake as part of the Government's contribution to the\nTA, to ensure that they are carried out appropriately and that they produce results\nthat can be used reliably as inputs for the TA's various activities;\n(iii) developing forecasts of (a) traffic growth rates in the study corridor, based on the\ncountry's projected economic growth; (b) investments in the study corridor and in\nthe southern area generally (with particular reference to the master plan for the\nsouthern area prepared with assistance from the Government of Japan); (c) the\nrole of the railway in the corridor, both as it presently exists and also with any\nimprovements to it that the Government might be proposing over the medium to\nlong term; and (d) other relevant factors;\n(iv) studying likely population and urban area growth trends, to determine when\nsections of the existing road that are not yet congested will become so:\n(v) studying capacity enhancing options for the corridor, including (a) bypasses on the\nexisting highway; (b) a new highway for part and all of the corridor length, based\non diversion between the existing and new highways at varying toll rates (to\ninclude a no-toll option); (c) construction, operation, and maintenance costs; and\n(d) such other factors as may be appropriate;\n(vi) studying options for private sector involvement in enhancing road capacity in the\ncorridor, with the options to include a build-operate-transfer or similar modality with\nand without Government participation (for example, in the form of land for the road\nworks themselves, land for commercial and residential development that might\nresult from construction of the road, taxation concessions, etc.);\n(vii) studying whether and how, under existing legislation, tolls could be applied to new\nand existing highways and, assuming this is possible, how newly constructed\nlengths of highway within the corridor could be tolled, how appropriate toll levels\ncould be determined, what might be the revenues generated from a range of toll\noptions, and the extent to which these revenues could fund operation and\nmaintenance costs of both new and existing roads in the corridor and also to\nservice debts incurred for the capacity enhancement works;\n(viii) studying how a toll facility could be managed, for example by an especially-created\nunit within RDA, or by some form of autonomous organization reporting either to\nRDA or directly to the Ministry of Transport and Highways (MOTH);"], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080229161323+08'00'", "Creator": "Envision OCR", "Keywords": "southern transport corridor, japan special fund, ministry of transport and highways, road development authority, sri lanka primary road network, adb technical assistance 2892, adb project 26522", "Producer": "www.adlibsoftware.com:EXS3185-Windows 2003:TNG", "ModDate": "D:20080925120749+08'00'", "Title": "Southern Transport Corridor Project (Financed from the Japan Special Fund)"}}
