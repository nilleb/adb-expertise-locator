The Project has experienced substantial cost overrun in \ncivil works, mainly because of (i) price underestimation of noncore \nsubprojects at the period of processing of the original loan, and \n(ii) price  escalation  of  construction  labor  and  materials  during \nconstruction.  Local  currency  appreciation  during  construction \nfurther  increased  the  financing  gap.  The  total  additional  cost \nrequired under the public sector portion of the Project is estimated \nat $307 million. \n   \n  The supplementary loan is proposed to ensure completion of the \nProject by addressing remedial measures to the implementation \ndelay as well as the issue of the cost overrun in civil works. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will finance $100 million to cover \npart of (i) the price escalation during construction, and (ii) the \nfinancing  gap  caused  by  local  currency  appreciation.  The \nGovernment of India will finance the remaining $207 million.  \n   \n  The risk of further cost overrun is low because (i) all subproject \napproval and civil works contract awards have been completed, \n(ii) the overall physical progress of civil works has exceeded 80%, \nand  (iii)  the  revised  cost  estimate  includes  sufficient \ncontingencies.  \n   \n  While nine civil works contracts in the states of Madhya Pradesh \nand Rajasthan are well under way, the progress of three civil \nworks contracts in Uttar Pradesh is behind schedule. By extending \nthe supplementary loan, the Government and ADB will be able to \nensure  implementation  of  these  contracts  to  the  required \nstandards.  \n   \n  The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the Executing \nAgency,  has  undertaken  measures  to  ensure  smooth \nimplementation. High-level coordination meetings between NHAI \nand the state government of Uttar Pradesh have been instituted to ", "ii \n \nexpedite site clearance. NHAI management has been meeting \nwith the contractors at management level on a quarterly basis to \ndiscuss and resolve issues smoothly and substantively. With the \nother  nine  contracts  well  under  way,  both  the  supervision \nconsultants and the project implementation unit of NHAI are now \nfocused on the three contracts in Uttar Pradesh. Project progress \nwill also be monitored at the tripartite portfolio review meetings \n(TPRMs).  TPRMs  are  periodical  meetings  held  among  the \nMinistry of Finance, executing agencies for ADB-assisted projects, \nand ADB to review the India portfolio. Since 2005, TPRMs have \nproven to be effective in ensuring smooth project implementation.  \n   \nRevised Cost Estimates  Revised costs for the Project, including those to be financed under \nthe proposed supplementary loan, are estimated at $1,099 million \nincluding taxes and duties, contingencies, and financing charges \nduring implementation.  \n   \nRevised Financing Plan  Under the revised financing arrangements, the two ADB loans will \ncover 45.5% of the total investment costs. The Government will \nfinance  45.1%,  and  the  private  sector  will  finance  9.4%.  The \nGovernment  will  make  the  proposed  supplementary  loan \nproceeds available to NHAI promptly. \n   \nSupplementary Financial  A  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \nAssistance Amount and  (OCR) will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \nTerms  (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The supplementary OCR loan will \nhave a term of 19 years, including a grace period of 2 years, an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft \nsupplementary loan agreement. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 December 2011 \n   \nImplementation  Implementation  arrangements  for  the  proposed  supplementary \nArrangements  loan will remain the same as for the original loan, except for (i) a \n  revised  implementation  period,  (ii)  continuous  engagement  of \ncontractors and consultants, (iii) procurement of equipment, and \n(iv) the use of retroactive financing. \n \nEnvironmental  and  social  safeguards  assessments  were \nconducted prior to approval of the original loan and subprojects. \nSince there is no physical change within the original scope and/or \ndesign, or modified or incremental activities or components, no \nadditional environmental and social safeguards assessments are \nnecessary.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary loan to India for the National Highway Corridor (Sector) I Project.1 \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  Project Rationale \n2.  India\u2019s economy had long suffered from the national highway system\u2019s chronic capacity \nshortage. In August 2001, of the national highway network of 58,112 kilometers (km), 40% were \nstill single lane and 57% were two lanes. Four-lane highways, a desirable standard for arterial \nnational  corridors,  accounted  for  only  3%.  The  Tenth  Five  Year  Plan  (2002\u20132007)  of  the \nGovernment of India (the Government) thus set forth several investment programs to improve \nthe  national  highway  system  by  (i)  widening  22,000  km  of  two-lane  roads  to  four  lanes; \n(ii) constructing  2,000 km  of  expressways;  (iii)  widening  22,500  km  of  single-lane  roads  to \ntwo lanes; and (iv) strengthening 19,300 km of pavement. The total investment required to \nimplement these programs was estimated at $37 billion.  \n \n3.  Because of the magnitude of investments required, the Government placed highest \npriority on the National Highway Development Program (NHDP) to upgrade three key arterial \ncorridors:  (i)  Golden  Quadrilateral\u20146,000  km;  (ii)  North\u2013South  Corridor\u20144,000  km;  and \n(iii) East\u2013West  Corridor\u20143,300  km.  In  2003,  the  total  program  cost  was  estimated  at \n$13 billion\u2013$15 billion, to which the Government decided to allocate the central road funds on a \npriority basis. The NHDP was expected to help contribute to the increased integration of the \ncountry by connecting the entire eastern and western and also northern and southern ends of \nthe country. \n \n4.  Since 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) had supported NHDP with three loans \nand provided another two in 2003 and 2004, totaling $1.54 billion (12% of the total program \ncost).2  \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n5.  In support of the NHDP, ADB approved the National Highway Corridor (Sector) I Project, \nthe  fourth  in  the  series,  for  $400  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  in \nDecember 2003. The overall objective of the Project is to establish a policy and institutional \nframework for the efficient delivery of highway development and operation and maintenance \n                                                 \n1  A design and monitoring framework was revised based on the program and project framework for the original loan \nin ADB. 2003.

Under  this  framework,  the  Project  focuses  on  the  East\u2013West  Corridor  to \nachieve the following:  \n \n(i)  upgrading key national arterial corridors connecting the eastern and western \nends of the country, \n(ii)  facilitating public sector participation (PSP) in highway development,  \n(iii)  contributing  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  prevent  the  spread  of  human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) and increase awareness of the possible risk of \nwomen and children trafficking,  and \n(iv)  enhancing road safety through pilot introduction of a safety zone concept for part \nof the national highway under the East\u2013West Corridor.  \n \n6.  In line with the objectives and scope, the Project includes the following components:  \n \n(i)  Part A: Highway investment component. This component is to widen stretches \nbetween Chittorgarh in the state of Rajasthan and Orai in the state of Uttar \nPradesh into four-lane roads.  \n(ii)  Part B: Private sector participation component. This component is to widen \nthe stretch between Orai and Barah in Uttar Pradesh into four-lane roads through \nPSP scheme. \n(iii)  Part  C:  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  component.  This  component  is  to \nconduct campaigns to help prevent the spread of HIV and increase awareness of \nthe risk of trafficking in women and children. \n(iv)  Part D: Road safety component. This component is to develop a safety zone \nconcept and carry out pilot testing of the concept in a selected section between \nthe cities of Jhansi and Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh.  \n \nC.

Status of and Progress in Project Implementation \n10.  Overview. After the initial 1-year delay in procurement and subproject approval, the \nNational  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI),  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project,  made \nsubstantial progress in project implementation. All 12 civil works contracts under the ADB-\nfinanced highway investment component were awarded in 2005. Out of the 12 civil works \ncontracts, 6 contracts were substantially completed in 2008, and 3 contracts will be substantially \ncompleted by the middle of 2009. The performance of the remaining 3 contracts, which are all in \nUttar Pradesh, is at a low level\u2014about 50%. Substantial completion of the remaining contracts \nis anticipated by June 2010. The overall physical progress of all 12 civil works contracts, \nhowever, has exceeded 80% on a weighted average basis. With respect to the PSP component, \nNHAI engaged a financial adviser to support development of part of the project corridor through \nPSP. After competitive bidding, a build-operate-transfer (BOT) annuity concession was awarded \nin  April  2006,  and  construction  works  commenced  in  October  2006.  Completion  of  the \nconstruction works is currently anticipated by the end of 2009. With respect to the HIV/AIDS and \nanti-trafficking  component,  NHAI  has  conducted  the  awareness  campaign  through \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). For the road safety component, NHAI identified the \nJhansi\u2013Orai  section  as  a  pilot  section  for  implementation  of  a  safety  zone.  Consultant \nrecruitment is currently in process. Appendix 2 details the project implementation status.  \n \n11.  Cost Overrun. The Project has experienced a substantial cost overrun in civil works. \nThe total civil works cost under the ADB-financed component was estimated at Rs24,633 million \n(or  $547  million)3 at  the  time  of  processing  the  Project.  However,  the  total  contract  price \nawarded in 2005 amounted to Rs34,354 million (or $763 million), i.e., cost overrun of 39%. In \naddition, during the construction period after the contract awards, all major construction input \nitems experienced price escalation. The total final contract price of the 12 ADB-financed civil \nworks contracts is now expected to be Rs39,170 million (or $870 million), 14% above the total \nawarded price and 59% above the original estimates. When ADB approved subprojects and \ncontract awards in 2005, substantial cost overrun was observed. NHAI opted to keep ADB \n                                                 \n3 In this paragraph, $1 = Rs45 is used\u2014averaging the whole project period. \n ", "4   \nfinancing to all subprojects by lowering the ADB financing percentage, so that all subprojects \ncould be implemented to the required standards set out in the loan agreement. This matter was \ndiscussed and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), NHAI, and ADB agreed that counterpart funds \nwould be used to finance the balance. However, as construction prices have further escalated \nand  NHDP  has  been  substantially  enlarged  since  commencement  of  the  Project, 4  the \nGovernment requested a supplementary loan from ADB to secure long-term loan funds for the \nProject. With respect to the original loan proceeds, as ADB has kept financing 67% of the civil \nworks expenditures in accordance with the original loan agreement, cumulative disbursement \nunder the loan has exceeded 97% of the net loan amount of $400 million. The loan proceeds for \ncivil works have been depleted.  \n \n12.  Strength of the Project. The effectiveness of the project management arrangements for \nthe  major  part  of  the  Project  has  been  proven.  Particularly,  the  project  team  at  NHAI \nheadquarters and three project implementation units (PIUs) located in Madhya Pradesh and \nRajasthan demonstrated the capacity to implement the Project successfully. This is shown as (i) \nall  12  civil  works  contracts  under  the  ADB-financed  highway  investment  component  were \nawarded in 2005; and (ii) out of 9 contracts in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, 6 contracts were \nsubstantially completed in 2008, and the remaining 3 contracts will be substantially completed \nby the middle of 2009. The progress in these contracts contributed to the achievements in \ndisbursement since 2006 ($101 million in 2006, $152 million in 2007, and $131 million in 2008). \nThe overall physical progress of the highway investment component has already exceeded \n80%. \n \n13.  Weakness of the Project. There are three main areas experiencing delays in project \nimplementation. First, at the initial stage, the Project experienced a delay of about 1 year \nbecause of (i) a longer procurement period mainly caused by implementation of prequalification \nfor  civil  works  contracts,  and  (ii)  prolonged  process  for  subproject  approval.  Second,  the \nprogress of the three civil works contracts in Uttar Pradesh has been slow. The delay is the \nresult  of  (i)  an  initial  delay  in  site  clearance,  (ii)  slow  mobilization  of  contractors,  and \n(iii) insufficient staffing at the construction supervision side. Third, the road safety component is \nyet to be implemented. As NHAI realized the implications of the cost increase in civil works for \nthe Project, NHAI made a policy decision that the utilization of the ADB loan proceeds be \nprioritized for completion of the civil works and the road safety component be financed from \nNHAI\u2019s own resources.5 NHAI did not receive any response from its invitation for proposals from \nconsulting firms.   \n \n14.  The supplementary loan is proposed to ensure completion of the Project by addressing \nremedial measures to the implementation delays as well as the cost overrun in civil works \n(paras. 27\u201331).  \n \n                                                 \n4  The Project is in NHDP phase II. The NHDP has been substantially enlarged from Rs646,390 million (up to \nphase II)  to  Rs2,198,350  million  (up  to  phase  VII  excluding  phase  IV  which  is  under  consideration)  since \ncommencement of the Project. \n5  $12.3 million ($11.8 million for equipment and $0.5 million for consulting services) was originally envisaged to be \nfinanced from ADB\u2019s loan proceeds. However, experiencing a substantial cost overrun in civil works, NHAI \nprioritized utilization of the ADB loan proceeds for civil works.  ", "  5\nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Cost Overrun \n15.  The reason for the cost overrun is an increase in civil works cost, caused mainly by two \nfactors: (i) price underestimation of noncore subprojects at the period of processing of the \noriginal loan, and (ii) price escalation of construction labor and materials during construction. \nThe original price underestimation is Rs9,721 million or $216 million (footnote 3) (67%) of the \ntotal civil works cost overrun and the construction price escalation amounts to Rs4,816 million or \n$107  million  (33%)  of  the  total  civil  works  cost  overrun.  The  slow  startup  of  project \nimplementation also had an adverse effect on these factors. Appendix 3 analyzes the cost \noverrun in civil works. \n \n(i)  Underestimation at the period of processing of the original loan. During \nprocessing of the original loan, a cost estimate of $0.90 million per kilometer was \nused for noncore subprojects. This was based on prices of upgrading artery \ncorridors to four lanes in previous similar projects because detailed estimates \nwere not ready. The actual price during the noncore subproject approval and \ncontract award period was $1.35 million per kilometer. MOF, NHAI, and ADB \nagreed that counterpart funds would be used to finance this financing gap (para. \n11).   \n \n(ii)  Price escalation during construction. Contracts for the highway construction \nprovide for price adjustment for the increase (or decrease) in rates and prices of \nlabor, cement, steel, plant, machinery and spares, fuel and lubricants, and other \nlocal materials in accordance with the contracts. During the construction period, \nall these items experienced price escalation. Price escalations accounted for \n100%  of  the  cost  increase  during  the  construction  period  after  the  contract \nawards. The financing gap has been greater than would have been because the \noriginal cost estimates at the time of processing of the original loan did not \ninclude contingencies. \n \n16.  In addition to the cost overrun, local currency appreciation contributed to the financing \ngap of $21 million under the ADB loan. At the time of loan appraisal of the Project in 2003, the \nexchange rate was Rs45 per $1. However, ADB utilized most of the original loan proceeds \nwhen the local currency appreciated against the US dollar. $373 million (93% of the original \nloan) has been utilized to date at an average rate of Rs42.5 per $1 for civil works, leading to the \n$21 million financing gap because of currency fluctuation.   \n \nB.  Impact on the Project  \n17.  The Government needs to bear all additional costs required under the public sector \nportion of the Project, estimated at $307 million,6 to complete the Project if no supplementary \nloan is provided. In addition, the following risks are envisaged relating to the achievement of the \noriginal project objective if the supplementary loan is not provided: (i) further delay in completion \nof  the  ADB-financed  highway  investment  component,  which  will  decrease  economic  and \nfinancial benefits to the country and NHAI; and (ii) further delay in implementation of the road \nsafety component. With respect to the highway investment component, although NHAI has \n                                                 \n6  The cost overrun of civil works is estimated at $323 million. As there are some savings of the costs in right-of-way, \nrelocation of utilities, and consulting services, the additional cost required under the public sector portion of the \nProject is estimated at $307 million.   \n ", "6   \ndemonstrated  its  capacity  to  implement  the  Project  satisfactorily  in  Madhya  Pradesh  and \nRajasthan, the progress of three contracts in Uttar Pradesh has been slow. Currently, it is \nexpected that these three contracts will be substantially completed in 2010. By extending the \nsupplementary loan, the Government and ADB will be able to monitor the progress of these \ncontracts continuously and address implementation issues. If this leverage is lost, completion of \nthese contracts, i.e., completion of the entire highway investment component, may be delayed \nfurther. Delay in completion of the remaining section also means delay in commencement of \ngeneration of the Project\u2019s full economic and financial benefits to the country and NHAI. It is \nestimated that $14 million of economic benefit to the country and $10 million of toll revenue to \nNHAI will not be captured if completion of the remaining section is delayed by 1 year. In \naddition, NHAI is yet to implement the road safety component. With the supplementary loan, \nADB can extend implementation support for the component. If ADB\u2019s involvement in the Project \nis not continued, this component may suffer further delay.  \n \nC.  Rationale \n18.  Compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Supplementary Financing. The Project is under \nthe NHDP, which is part of the Government\u2019s Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007\u20132012), so the \nProject continues to be a priority in the Government\u2019s development strategy. The objective of \nthe  supplementary  loan  is  to  ensure  completion  of  the  Project  as  originally  envisaged  by \naddressing remedial measures to the implementation delays as well as the issue of the cost \noverrun in civil works (paras. 27\u201331). The overall physical progress of ADB-financed civil works \ncontracts under the Project has exceeded 80%, and physical completion of the Project is \nexpected by June 2011, including the road safety component and the defect liability period of \nthe last civil works contract under the highway investment component. The Project is in an \nadvanced stage of implementation and can be completed within a relatively short time.  \n \n19.  The  increase  in  the  original  cost  estimates  in  the  Project  was  caused  by  price \nunderestimation  of  noncore  subprojects  at  the  original  loan  processing  period  and  price \nescalation of labor and materials during the construction period. Therefore, there is (i) no \nphysical change within the original scope and/or design, or modified or incremental activities or \ncomponents; and (ii) no change in environment and social safeguards requirements. \n \n20.  Economic and Financial Viability and Financial Sustainability. Revised economic \nand  financial  analyses  have  been  conducted  for  the  whole  stretch  of  the  project  corridor, \nincluding core and noncore subprojects, to provide the complete economic and financial status \nof the Project.7 The revised total costs and benefits have been used for evaluating the Project. \nThe  revised  study  on  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  confirms  the  Project  is \neconomically viable; the EIRR is 15.2%. The analysis also shows that the quantified economic \nbenefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. In the worst-case scenario\u2014overall benefits \nreduced by 20%\u2014the EIRR remains at 13.4%. In the revised financial assessment, the financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  analysis  is  5.8%,  which  is  above  NHAI\u2019s  marginal  weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC) in real terms, estimated at 2.5%. In the sensitivity tests, FIRR is \nmost adversely affected by the increase in O&M cost and decrease in revenue. Under this \nscenario, the FIRR of 4.0% is still above NHAI's marginal WACC, so the Project remains \nfinancially viable. With respect to the sustainability of the Project, NHAI has the capacity to \noperate and maintain the project roads. NHAI collects tolls, part of which is utilized for O&M \n                                                 \n7  The original report and recommendation of the President (RRP) provided only the EIRR and FIRR for the core \nsubprojects because of the sector loan modality.  ", "  7\nactivities.8 A designated corridor management unit has been established in NHAI to oversee \nO&M activities of highways. For the project roads, operate-maintain-transfer concessions are to \nbe awarded (except the section where a BOT annuity concession has been awarded) to parties \nthat  will  offer  the  highest  periodical  payments  to  NHAI.  Therefore,  the  Project  remains \neconomically viable and financially sustainable.   \n \nD.  Revised Cost Estimates  \n21.  Revised  costs  for  the  Project,  including  those  to  be  financed  under  the  proposed \nsupplementary loan, are estimated at $1,099 million including taxes and duties, contingencies, \nand financing charges during implementation. Table 3 summarizes the revised cost estimates \nfor the Project and details are in Appendix 4. \n \nTable 3: Revised Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amountsa \nA.

Commitment charges are paid amount and estimates computed at 0.15% for undisbursed \nsupplementary loan amount and 0.75% for undisbursed original loan amount. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and National Highways Authority of India. \n \nE.  Revised Financing Plan \n22.  Among the additional cost under the public sector portion of the Project, estimated at \n$307 million, ADB will finance $100 million to cover part of (i) the price escalation during \nconstruction, and (ii) the financing gap caused by local currency appreciation. The Government \nwill close the remaining financing gap of $207 million.  \n \n23.  The original loan of $400 million was allocated from ADB\u2019s OCR. With an additional \n$100 million proposed under the supplementary loan from OCR, the total available ADB loan \namount will be $500 million. The supplementary OCR loan will have a term  of 19 years, \nincluding a grace period of 2 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft supplementary loan agreement. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \n                                                 \n8  According to NHAI\u2019s financial statement for FY2008, NHAI collected Rs45.7 billion in tolls and spent Rs23.8 billion \non maintenance of highways during FY2008. \n ", "8   \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere the Government\u2019s own independent decision and not in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB.  \n \n24.  Under  the  revised  financing  arrangements,  the  two  ADB  loans  will  cover  45.5% \n($500 million) of the total investment costs of $1,099 million. The proposed supplementary loan \nwill cover 29.5% ($100 million) of the total additional financing requirement of $339 million.9 The \nsupplementary  loan  will  finance  a  portion  of  civil  works  under  the  highway  investment \ncomponent ($97.2 million) and consulting services ($2.0 million for the highway investment \ncomponent and $0.8 million for the road safety component). The loan proceeds under the \noriginal loan have been disbursed on the basis of 67% of civil works expenditures, and 100% of \nconsulting services expenditures excluding taxes and duties. However, the loan proceeds under \nthe supplementary loan will be disbursed on the basis of 90%10 of civil works expenditures, and \n100% of consulting services expenditures excluding taxes and duties.  \n \n25.  The financing charges during implementation will not be capitalized in the ADB loans. Of \nthe total investment costs, the Government will finance 45.1%, which will include taxes and \nduties, a portion of civil works, right-of-way, relocation of utilities, a portion of consulting services, \nequipment, project management, and financial charges. The construction cost of the Orai\u2013\nBarah section ($103 million) being developed under a PSP scheme will be covered by a private \nconcessionaire. The revised financing plan (showing both the public and private sector portions) \nis summarized in Table 4. Details of the revised financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n \n26.  The Government will make the proposed supplementary loan proceeds available to \nNHAI promptly. The Government\u2019s policy of assistance to NHAI for the East\u2013West Corridor is a \nloan-grant ratio of 20:80. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan.  \n \nTable 4: Revised Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSources  $ Million  Percent \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary Capital Resources: Original Allocation       400.0  36.4 \nOrdinary Capital Resources: Supplementary Allocation       100.0  9.1 \nGovernment     \nOriginal Allocation       291.6  26.5 \nSupplementary Allocation       204.1a  18.6 \nPrivate Sector     \nOriginal Allocation         68.6  6.2 \nSupplementary Allocation         34.7  3.2 \nTotal     1,099.0  100.0 \n          a   The additional cost required under the public sector portion of the Project is $307.3 million. ADB \nwill finance $100.0 million, and the Government will finance $207.3 million. Because there is \nsaving of $3.2 million in the Government expenditures under the private sector portion of the \nProject, the net supplementary loan allocation of the Government will be $204.1 million. \n         Sources: Asian Development Bank and National Highways Authority of India. \n \n                                                 \n9 The amount of $339 million includes cost overrun in the private sector portion. \n10 90% is proposed because now civil works expenditures are being borne solely by the Government as the original \nADB loan proceeds for civil works have been depleted. By the time the supplementary loan becomes effective, the \nGovernment will have financed most of the $207 million, i.e., the Government\u2019s financing part of the additional cost \nunder the public sector portion. Therefore, for ADB to fully finance $100 million under the constraint of the \nretroactive financing ceiling of 20%, ADB\u2019s disbursement percentage for the supplementary loan needs to be \nincreased. However, this arrangement will not increase ADB\u2019s overall financing share for the Project from that in \nthe original financing plan. ADB\u2019s overall financing share in the original financing plan is 52.6% and that in the \nrevised financing plan is 45.5%. ", "  9\nF.  Remedial Steps \n27.  Cost Overrun. The risk of further cost overrun is low because (i) all subproject approval \nand civil works contract awards have been completed, (ii) the overall physical progress of civil \nworks has already exceeded 80%, and (iii) the revised cost estimate for the supplementary loan \nincludes contingencies while the original cost estimate did not include contingencies because of \nthe sector loan modality.  \n \n28.  Performance of Remaining Civil Works Contracts in Uttar Pradesh. Civil works \nprocurement and subproject approval, which caused initial delay in project implementation, have \nbeen completed. The remaining risks of the Project are (i) delays in the three civil works \ncontracts  in  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  (ii)  further  delay  in  implementation  of  the  road  safety \ncomponent.  \n \n29.  The delays in civil works in Uttar Pradesh are attributed to (i) initial delays in site \nclearance, (ii) contractors\u2019 slow mobilization, and (iii) insufficient staffing at the construction \nsupervision  side.  NHAI  has  undertaken  measures  to  resolve  these  issues.  High-level \ncoordination meetings between NHAI and the state government of Uttar Pradesh to resolve the \nsite  clearance  matter  have  been  conducted  since  2007.11 NHAI  management  has  been \nconducting  regular  meetings  with  management  of  the  contractors  to  discuss  and  resolve \ncontract  issues  smoothly  and  substantively.  Both  the  supervision  consultants  and  the  PIU \nJhansi can better focus on the three contracts, and the capacity of the PIU is no longer an \nissue.12  \n \n30.  To address the implementation issues for the three remaining contracts in Uttar Pradesh \ncontinuously, NHAI has assured that it will continue meetings with the three contractors in Uttar \nPradesh at management level on a quarterly basis. NHAI will also enable ADB to be present at \nsuch meetings upon ADB\u2019s request. By such arrangement, ADB will also be able to review any \ncontract management issues such as contractor performance, construction safety, and contract \nvariation, if required.  \n \n31.  Implementation of Road Safety Component. Unsuccessful recruitment of a consulting \nfirm to date is mainly attributed to two factors. First, the original costing of the consulting \nservices ($0.5 million) was an underestimation of the input costs. Second, NHAI had tried to \nrecruit consultants using its own funds and procedures, which lessened the opportunity to \nadvertise widely the business opportunity to international firms, so no bids were received. With \nrespect  to  the  first  factor,  sufficient  costing  for  the  assignment  is  proposed,  estimated  at \n$0.9 million. With respect to the second factor, NHAI has resumed the recruitment process \nusing ADB\u2019s procedures and loan proceeds. ADB is also extending the necessary support to \nexpedite the process. NHAI has assured that it will carry out pilot testing of a safety zone \n                                                 \n11 The chairman and/or member from NHAI and the chief secretary and/or principal secretary of the Public Works \nDepartment from the state government of Uttar Pradesh usually participate in these meetings, which have helped \nexpedite site clearance. \n12 The supervision consultants for the three Uttar Pradesh contracts cover a total of six contracts (three in Madhya \nPradesh). As the contracts in Madhya Pradesh have been substantially completed, the supervision consultants can \nshift personnel from Madhya Pradesh to Uttar Pradesh. In addition, the PIU Jhansi used to cover four contracts of \nthe Project, including a BOT contract under the PSP component. However, because the BOT contract was \ntransferred from the PIU Jhansi to another PIU in 2008, the PIU Jhansi now has only three project contracts to \noversee. The other three PIUs under the ADB-financed component (PIUs Chittorgarh, Baran and Shivpuri), which \nare satisfactorily implementing the Project, also cover three project contracts per PIU. The PIU Jhansi is headed by \na project director supported by three technical managers. This is a standard setup to manage three project \ncontracts.  \n ", "10  \nconcept in a timely manner. Consultants to be recruited will assist NHAI in implementing the \ncomponent. \n \n32.  Measures  for  Future  Projects.  In  addition  to  project-specific  measures,  the \nGovernment and ADB have been exerting intensive efforts in countrywide portfolio management \nin recent years. The tripartite portfolio review meeting (TPRM) has been held 2\u20133 times a year \nsince 2005 among MOF, executing agencies, and ADB, which significantly improved India\u2019s \nportfolio performance. During TPRMs, impediments to project implementation for each project \nare identified and solutions to overcome them are agreed, covering procurement, accurate cost \nestimation, cost overrun, realistic scheduling, safeguards, and other matters. Time-bound action \nplans  are  developed  for  ongoing  and  upcoming  projects  to  improve  overall  portfolio \nperformance.13 In 2008, TPRM was geared up to monitor project outcomes and outputs to \ndemonstrate ADB\u2019s development effectiveness.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n33.  Implementation arrangements for the Project under the proposed supplementary loan, \nincluding project management; procurement (a procurement plan is in Appendix 5); consulting \nservices;  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date); 14 disbursement \narrangements;  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting;  project  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation; and project review remain the same as those in the original loan, except four specific \naspects: \n \n(i)  Revised  implementation  period.  The original closing date of 31 December \n2007  has  been  extended  to  31  December  2009  because  of  implementation \ndelays.  Substantial  completion  of  civil  works  is  expected  in  June  2010. \nCompletion of the road safety component is expected in June 2011. Under the \ncircumstances, the completion date of the Project needs to be extended until \n30 June 2011 and the closing date of the original loan needs to be extended until \n31 December 2011. A revised implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.  \n \n(ii)  Continuous engagement of contractors and consultants. Under the original \nloan for the Project, 12 civil works contractors and 3 international construction \nsupervision  consulting  firms  under  the  highway  investment  component  were \nengaged in accordance with the original loan agreement. In addition, a consulting \nfirm for the road safety component is under recruitment in accordance with the \noriginal loan agreement. When the loan proceeds under the original loan are \n                                                 \n13 Major actions identified in the TPRM and being implemented include (i) the project readiness checklist that has \nbeen institutionalized by the Government since July 2008, which aims at improving the project quality at entry and \ndisbursement soon after loan signing; (ii) the business opportunity seminar that has been strengthened since 2007 \nto  attract  more  qualified  contractors,  suppliers,  and  consultants  to  ADB\u2019s  projects  and  make  procurement \nsuccessful; and (iii) the capacity building programs that have also been intensified, targeting staff of executing \nagencies to familiarize themselves for various project activities, which helps avoid price escalation caused by \ndelays in project implementation. \n14 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government and NHAI. Consistent with its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly \nor through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing \nAgency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. ", "  11\nexhausted, the loan proceeds under the supplementary loan will continue to \nfinance the existing contracts until the end of project implementation.  \n \n(iii)  Procurement  of  equipment.  Safety  equipment  originally  planned  for  ADB \nfinancing will be procured by a concessionaire through operate-maintain-transfer \narrangements. This approach is practical to make the safety zone operational as \nan operator is required for its implementation. Consultants being recruited under \nthe road safety component using ADB\u2019s loan proceeds will assist NHAI in the \nprocurement of equipment. \n \n(iv)  Retroactive  financing.  To  ensure  continuity  of  the  works  under  ongoing \ncontracts, the Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval of retroactive financing \nof  up  to  20%  of  the  proposed  supplementary  financing  amount  for  eligible \nexpenditures in civil works incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but no earlier than \n12 months before the signing of the Loan Agreement. The Government has been \nadvised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  retroactive  financing  does  not  constitute  a \ncommitment to finance the supplementary financing. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n34.  The increase in the original cost estimates was caused by price underestimation of \nnoncore subprojects at the period of processing of the original loan and price escalation of \nconstruction labor and materials during construction. There is (i) no physical change within the \noriginal scope and/or design, or modified or incremental activities or components; and (ii) no \nchange in environment and social safeguards requirements. Therefore, the project benefits, \nimpacts, assumptions, and risks will remain the same as for the original loan, except for the \nproject impacts on economic and financial viability. \n   \n35.  Economic Viability. The Project is economically viable; the estimated EIRR value is \n15.2%. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for (i) generated traffic reduced by 50%, \n(ii) benefits from time savings reduced by 50%, (iii) overall benefits reduced by 20%, and (iv) the \nscenario in which construction was completed in 2008 on schedule in accordance with the \noriginal contracts. The results show that the quantified economic benefits are robust to various \nsensitivity tests. The project roads according to the original schedule in the contracts should \nhave been completed in 2008, but the delay has only an insignificant impact on the overall \neconomic analysis results. Economic analysis is in Appendix 7.   \n \n36.  Financial  Viability  and  Sustainability.  Toll  revenues  are  estimated  based  on  the \nprojected traffic levels and applicable toll rates for national highways.15 The FIRR for the 30-year \noperation period is 5.8%. This is well below the level to attract PSP with full cost recovery from \ntoll revenue. Therefore, the validity of the decision to award the BOT component on an annuity \nbasis is confirmed. NHAI\u2019s marginal WACC in real terms is estimated at about 2.5%. The FIRR \nindicates a rate of return higher than the WACC, so the project is financially viable. Sensitivity \nanalysis has been carried out on the following scenarios: (i) O&M cost increased by 20%, \n(ii) revenue reduced by 20%, (iii) O&M cost increased by 20% and revenue reduced by 20%, \nand (iv) completion in 2008 on schedule in accordance with the original contracts. The results of \nthe sensitivity analysis on various cost and revenue assumptions confirm that NHAI can recover \nthe  project  investment  through  tolls.  Financial  analysis  is  in  Appendix  7.  With  respect  to \n                                                 \n15 The Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways. 2008.

In addition to the assurances set forth in the Loan Agreement (Ordinary Operations), and \nthe  Project  Agreement,  dated  27  October  2004,  both  for  the  National  Highway  Corridor \n(Sector) I Project, the Government of India and the National Highways Authority of India have \ngiven the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that NHAI convenes a quarterly management level \ncontract performance review meeting, with contractors that have not substantially \ncompleted Works under the Project. NHAI will inform ADB in advance of such \nmeetings and upon ADB\u2019s request, ADB may be present at the meeting as \nobserver. \n(ii)  Within 3 months after the effective date, NHAI will have recruited consultants for \nthe road safety component. Furthermore, the Government will ensure that NHAI \nimplements pilot testing of the safety zone concept within 21 months after the \nrecruitment of the consultants.  \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that NHAI provides the required counterpart funds \nfor project implementation on time, to cover the required remaining funds needed \nto cover the cost overrun. NHAI will ensure prompt disbursement of appropriated \nfunds to ensure the successful completion of the Project implementation. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed supplementary loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nsupplementary  loan  of  $100,000,000  to  India  for  the  National  Highway  Corridor  (Sector)  I \nProject from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  19  years, \nincluding a grace period of 2 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n5 June 2009 \n ", "Appendix 1     13 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and/or  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved mobility of  Average annual growth rates of  Post-implementation  Delivery of the Project is \npeople and goods to  passenger vehicles in the project  measurement  timely. \ncontribute to the  corridor achieve 7% and goods vehicles     \neconomic growth of the  achieve 5% from 2003 to 2015    State government\u2019s  Economy remains stable. \nstates connected by the    socioeconomic statistics   \nproject corridor   Direct contribution by road transport    Market mechanism functions \n  sector to gross state domestic product  well. \nincreases by 1% by 2015 (in FY2006 at   \ncurrent prices: 3% in Rajasthan, 3% in \nMadhya Pradesh, 4% in Uttar Pradesh) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved road transport  Travel time decreases (average running  Post-implementation  Delivery of the Project is \nservices and safety  speed increases) upon completion of  measurement  timely. \nalong the project  project roads: cars 80 kph (51.5 kph in     \ncorridor  2002) and trucks 60 kph (40 kph in  State government\u2019s data and  Enforcement and education \n2002)  statistics  of road safety function over \n    time \nNumber of traffic fatalities of project   \ncorridor in 2012 does not exceed pre-\nproject level (308 fatalities in 2001)  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Background \n \n1.  The Project was approved on 4 December 2003 for $400.0 million, and became effective \non  24  January  2005.  The  Project  has  the  following  components:  (i)  highway  investment \ncomponent to widen stretches between Chittorgarh and Orai into four-lane roads, (ii) private \nsector participation (PSP) component to include 10% of project highways to be developed \nthrough  PSP  scheme,  (iii)  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  component  to  conduct  awareness \nprogram, and (iv) road safety component to implement a pilot road safety zone. The National \nHighways Authority of India (NHAI), the Executing Agency of the Project, has made substantial \nprogress in project implementation. All civil works contracts have been awarded, and the overall \nphysical progress of civil works under the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed component \nhas exceeded 80%. Cumulative disbursement under the loan has exceeded 97% of the net loan \namount.  \n \nB.  Project Management \n \n2.  The project management arrangements under the Project are as follows: \n(i)  Highway investment component and PSP component. The project team of \nNHAI and project implementation units currently located at Chittorgarh, Baran, \nShivpuri, Jhansi, and Kanpur are implementing the components. \n(ii)  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  component.  The  Environmental  and  Social \nDevelopment Unit of NHAI is implementing the component. \n(iii)  Road  safety  component.  The  Corridor  Management  Unit  of  NHAI  is \nimplementing the component. \n \nC.  Highway Investment Component \n \n3.   After an initial 1-year delay in procurement and subproject approval, all 12 ADB-financed \ncontract packages were awarded for 595 kilometer (km) stretches of part of the East\u2013West \nCorridor in 2005. The overall physical progress has exceeded 80% on a weighted average \nbasis. The physical progress of each contract package is summarized in Table A2. \n \nTable A2: Status of Physical Progress \nPackage  Physical Progress (%)  Substantial \nLength (km)  Commencement \nNo.  As of end of March 2009  Completion \nRJ-6  41  October 2005  Substantially completed  December 2008 \nRJ-7  60  October 2005  Substantially completed  December 2008 \nRJ-8  61  October 2005  Substantially completed  December 2008 \nRJ-9  43  October 2005  95  (mid-2009) \nRJ-10  60  October 2005  92  (mid-2009) \nRJ-11  70  September 2005  Substantially completed  October 2008 \nMP-1  53  August 2005  Substantially completed  October 2008 \nMP-2  35  August 2005  Substantially completed  November 2008 \nMP/UP-1  41  October 2005  98  (mid-2009) \nUP-3  15  November 2005  55  (mid-2010) \nUP-4  66  October 2005  59  (mid-2010) \nUP-5  50  September 2005  33  (mid-2010) \nkm = kilometer, MP =  Madhya Pradesh, RJ = Rajasthan, UP =  Uttar Pradesh. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and National Highways Authority of India assessment. \n \n4.  Out of 12 civil works contract packages, 6 packages were substantially completed in \n2008, and 3 packages will be substantially completed by the middle of 2009. The performance \nof  packages  in  Rajasthan  and  Madhya  Pradesh  has  been  generally  satisfactory,  but  the \n ", "16     Appendix 2 \nprogress of three packages in Uttar Pradesh is still at a low level. NHAI has undertaken several \nmeasures to resolve this issue, including meetings with the three contractors in Uttar Pradesh at \nmanagement  level.  Through  such  efforts,  the  contractors  have  mobilized  to  speed  up  the \nprogress of work recently. In addition, the least performing contractor has recently increased \nlabor  forces  further  to  expedite  the  works.  Substantial  completion  of  the  remaining  three \npackages is anticipated by the middle of 2010.  \n \nD.  Private Sector Participation Component \n \n5.   The  Orai\u2013Bara  section  (62  km)  in  Uttar  Pradesh  was  selected  as  a  section  to  be \ndeveloped under PSP. NHAI engaged a financial adviser to support development of part of the \nproject corridor through PSP. Competitive bidding was conducted and a build-operate-transfer \n(BOT)  annuity  concession  was  awarded  in  April  2006.  Construction  works  commenced  in \nOctober 2006. Physical progress of civil works as of the end of March 2009 was 66%. The \ncompletion of civil works is anticipated by December 2009.   \n \nE.  HIV/AIDS and Anti-Trafficking Component \n \n6.   NHAI engaged nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to conduct a HIV/AlDS and human \ntrafficking awareness program. All the activities were conducted by the NGOs at worksites and \nin project-influenced areas. The activities included (i) awareness-raising among construction \nworkers, (ii) public awareness raising and a change behavior campaign among high-risk groups, \n(iii)  strengthening  the  referral  systems  for  sexually  transmitted  infection  and  HIV  for  early \ndiagnosis along priority highways, (iv) condom promotion and distribution, and (v) capacity \nbuilding of service providers and decision makers. In addition, civil works contracts incorporated \na provision requiring contractors to carry out HIV/AlDS awareness and prevention programs for \nits laborers. Contractors conducted HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns at project sites. No child \nlabor was employed, and women were engaged on the principle of equal pay for equal work at \nthe  worksites.  Monitoring  has  been  conducted  periodically  by  NGOs  and  supervision \nconsultants. \n \nF.  Road Safety Component \n \n7.   NHAI identified the Jhansi\u2013Orai section (120 km) in Uttar Pradesh as the pilot section of \nthe road safety zone. Subsequently, ADB approved a short list and request for proposals for \nconsulting services. However, as the selected section was unlikely to be ready for the road \nsafety zone in a timely manner because of the delay in the section\u2019s civil works, NHAI selected \na road section of about 150 km from the RJ-11, MP-1 and MP-2 packages as the pilot section. \nNHAI intended to include installation of road safety equipment in the operate-maintain-transfer \nconcession for the alternative section. To award this concession in a timely manner, NHAI \nneeded to expedite recruitment of a consulting firm that would prepare specifications of road \nsafety  equipment.  Thus,  NHAI  used  its  own  consultant  recruitment  procedures,  which  are \nusually much shorter than ADB\u2019s procedures. However, NHAI did not receive any proposals \nfrom consulting firms. The consultant recruitment process has been resumed using ADB\u2019s \nprocedures for the originally selected pilot section, i.e., the Jhansi\u2013Orai section. ADB is also \nextending the necessary support to expedite the process. A consulting firm is expected to be \nrecruited by September 2009, and completion of the component is expected by June 2011.  \n \nG.  Loan Covenants \n \n8.  The Project is in substantial compliance with the covenants in the Loan Agreement. \nAlmost all of the loan covenants have been either complied with or are being complied with. ", "Appendix 2     17 \nWith respect to audit project accounts, auditors did not raise any significant points of concern. \nThe covenant that requires NHAI to carry out a road safety audit for subproject highways during \nthe construction and operation stages and to develop recommendations to be used on other \nparts of the national highway system is yet to be complied with. Consultants being recruited \nunder the road safety component will carry out a road safety audit, and develop and implement \na pilot road safety zone in the project corridor, which will create a model for replication on other \nsections of the national highway system.  \n \nH.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n \n9.   Resettlement. Under the Project, efforts have been made to minimize land acquisition \nand reduce resettlement impacts as much as possible by (i) keeping rights-of-way to 45 meters \nwide in built-up areas and reserve forest areas, (ii) adopting concentric symmetrical widening, \n(iii) raising carriageways over congested segments, and (iv) using bypasses to avoid congested \nurban settlements. Resettlement plans were prepared as part of the report and recommendation \nof  the  President1 and  subproject  appraisal  reports.  Key  measures  to  mitigate  resettlement \nimpacts include compensation at full replacement cost for all lost assets to the affected persons. \nIn addition, the affected persons are receiving resettlement and rehabilitation assistance such \nas  shifting  allowance  for  shifting  the  affected  assets,  transitional  allowance  for  loss  of \nworkdays/income because of dislocation, and an economic rehabilitation grant for livelihood \nrestoration. NHAI engaged six NGOs for implementing the resettlement plans in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Significant progress has been achieved for \nboth land acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation activities. Out of 657 km, 635 km (97%) \nof  the  land  was  acquired  and  handed  over  to  the  contractors,  and  compensation  paid  to \ntitleholders. For disbursement of resettlement and rehabilitation assistance, non-titleholders had \nbeen fully paid. For titleholders, resettlement and rehabilitation assistance has been completed \nin  the  RJ-6,  RJ-7,  RJ-8,  RJ-11,  MP-1,  and  MP-2  packages.  Delivery  of  all  the  remaining \ncompensation and/or resettlement and rehabilitation assistance payments to titleholders for all \npackages is expected to be completed in a timely manner.  \n \n10.   Indigenous Peoples. During appraisal of the Project, it was confirmed that the Project \nwould not adversely affect indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities since (i) scheduled tribes \ndirectly  affected  by  the  Project  are  shop  owners  and  business  people;  (ii)  their  economic \nactivities are strongly tied to mainstream economic activities and are unlikely to be affected any \ndifferently than non-tribal people; and (iii) resettlement plans paid special attention to scheduled \ntribes and other vulnerable groups within the resettlement processes\u2014particularly livelihood and \nincome restoration, including a separate income restoration program for them in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). As such, a separate indigenous peoples \ndevelopment plan for scheduled tribes was not needed. During project implementation, the \nProject has not adversely affected indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities. \n \n11.   Environmental Aspects. An initial environmental examination was carried out for each \nsubproject. During project implementation, (i) the Project is in full compliance with Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  safeguard  requirements;  (ii)  necessary  clearances  and  permits  have  been \nobtained for all the contract packages, the conditions laid in these clearances/permits are being \ncomplied with, and the status of compliance is being reported to concerned authorities on a \nregular basis; and (iii) the mitigation measures proposed in the environmental management plan \nare being implemented by contractors, and the environmental quality performance is being \nmonitored and reports are submitted to statutory agencies. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "18     Appendix 3 \nANALYSIS OF COST OVERRUN IN CIVIL WORKS \n \n1.  Summary. There is a cost overrun of Rs14,537 million in civil works for the Project, a \n59% increase from the original cost estimate. The reasons are (i) price underestimation of \nnoncore  subprojects  during  processing  of  the  original  loan;  and  (ii)  price  escalation  of \nconstruction  labor  and  materials  during  the  construction  period.  The  original  price \nunderestimation  amounts  to  Rs9,721  (67%)  of  the  total  civil  works  cost  overrun  and  the \nconstruction cost escalation amounts to Rs4,816 (33%). In addition, disbursement made during \nthe strong Indian rupee period created a financing gap of $21 million in the loan of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Table A3.1 provides the timing and scope of the cost overrun. \n \nTable A3.1: Summary Table of Cost Increase in Civil Works \n(Rs million) \nSubproject  A. RRP Cost\u00aa  B. Awarded Cost  C.

A cost overrun of Rs9,579 million occurred in \nnoncore subprojects from the time of processing of the original cost estimates to the period of \ncontract awards in 2005; this amounts to 99% of the total cost overrun in that period. The cost \noverrun  is  because  a  cost  estimate  of  $0.90  million  per  kilometer  was  used  for  noncore \nsubprojects during processing of the original loan. There were no detailed estimates because of \nits sector loan modality\u2014only core projects were appraised in detail at the time of processing. \nThe estimation of $0.90 million per kilometer1 was based on prices of previous similar projects \non upgrading artery corridors to four lanes. The actual cost during the awards period was \n$1.35 million per kilometer for the noncore subprojects.  \n \n3.  When ADB approved noncore subprojects as well as contract awards in 2005, this \nsubstantial cost difference was observed. However, because all subprojects were included in \nthe original scope, the National Highways Authority of India did not want to leave out any of the \ncivil  works  contracts  from  the  ADB-financed  component.  This  issue  was  discussed  during \nsubsequent tripartite portfolio review meetings and the Ministry of Finance, National Highways \nAuthority of India, and ADB agreed that counterpart funds would be used to finance the balance. \nTherefore, the substantial cost overrun upon the approval of noncore subprojects as well as \ncontract awards was not an issue.    \n \n4.  Cost Increase during Construction after Contract Awards. The contract prices for \nthe highway construction need to be adjusted for the increase (or decrease) in rates and prices \n                                                 \n1  For example, the cost estimates for the section from Porbandar to Deesa (468.3 km) were $0.89 million per \nkilometer at the time of the approval of Loan 1944-IND (ADB. 2002.

During the construction period, all these input items \nexperienced price escalation as shown in Table A3.2. Price escalations account for 100% of the \ncost increase during the construction period.2 Comparing the 2008 average with the 2005 \naverage, the consumer price index for industrial workers had increased 22%. Some construction \nmaterials costs had increased even more, such as iron and steel (34%), cement (37%), and \nbitumen (150%). In addition, the original cost estimates at the time of processing of the original \nloan did not include contingencies because of the sector loan modality, which also contributes to \nthe widening of the financing gap.  \n \nTable A3.2: Index Price of Input Items for Highway Construction in 2005 and 2008 \n \nItem  A. 2005 Average  B. 2008 Average  B/A\u00aa \nConsumer Price Index for Industrial Worker \n(Base 1982 = 100)  536.0  655.9  1.22 \n \nWholesale Price Index (WPI) for Cement \n(Base 1993\u20131994 = 100)  162.5  222.7  1.37 \n \nWPI for Iron and Steel \n(Base 1993\u20131994 = 100)  253.5  338.4  1.34 \n \nWPI for Heavy Machinery and Parts \n(Base 1993\u20131994 = 100)  197.8  219.3  1.11 \n \nWPI for Bitumen \n(Base 1993\u20131994 = 100)  272.1  678.8  2.50 \n \nWPI for High Speed Diesel \n414.9  487.9  1.18 \n(Base 1993\u20131994 = 100) \na  2008 Average over 2005 Average. \nSources: Labour Bureau, Ministry of Labour and Employment, India; and Office of the Economic Advisor, Ministry of \nCommerce and Industry, India. \n \n5.   Effect of Currency Fluctuation. At the time of the loan appraisal of the Project in 2003, \nthe exchange rate was Rs45 per $1. However, the Indian rupee has fluctuated considerably \nfrom 2003 to 2009\u2014dropping close to Rs39 per $1 in July 2007 and peaking at Rs51 per $1 in \nMarch 2009. Despite this fluctuation, ADB disbursed a major part of the original loan proceeds \nduring the strong Indian rupee period between April 2007 and August 2008 (Figure A3.1)\u2014$373 \nmillion (93% of the original loan) has been disbursed to date at an average rate of Rs42.5 per \n$1 rate for civil works, creating a $21 million financing gap because of currency fluctuation. \n \n                                                 \n2 There is no cost increase in the total cost of 12 civil works contracts relating to change in work volume. \n ", "20     Appendix 3 \n \nFigure A3: Monthly Average Rupee and United States Dollar Exchange Rate \n52.0 \n50.0 \n 1\n$\ner  48.0 \np\ne \ne\nup 46.0 \nR\nn \na\ndi 44.0 \nn\ns: I\nate 42.0 \nR\ne \ng\nn 40.0 \na\nh\nc\nx\nE 38.0 \n36.0   Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar\n2005  2006  2007 2008  2009\nSource: Reserve Bank of India \n \n ", " \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($ million) \nOriginal Cost and Financing Plan    Revised Cost and Financing Plan \nGovernment  Private \nADB  ADB  Government  Private \nItem  of India  Sector \nTotal    Total  of India  Sector \n            OL  SL  Subtotal \n$  %  $  %  $  %  $  $  $  %  $  %  $  % \nA.

General \n1.   The Project comprises the rehabilitation and widening of 657 kilometers of existing \nintermediate or two-lane highways to dual two-lane carriageways. A financial and economic \nevaluation of the Project was undertaken to reassess the economic viability of the Project in \nlight of the cost increase, comparing the with- and without-project scenarios as well as the \nimpact  of  delays  in  project  completion.  The  analysis  follows  the  same  approach  used  for \nappraisal of the original loan1 for the Project, with updates and additional considerations. The \ntraffic data was verified with limited counts, and traffic growth was moderated based on the \nanalysis. \n \n2.  The project road comprises five sections, A to E, stretching from Chittorgarh in the west \nto Barah in the east. Table A7.1 shows the details of each section.  \n \nTable A7.1: Section Details \nSection  Section Name  Length (km) \nSection A  Chittorgarh\u2013Kota excluding Kota bypass (NH76)  162 \nSection B  Kota\u2013Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh border (NH76)  173 \nRajasthan and Madhya Pradesh border\u2013Jhansi excluding \nSection C  129 \nJhansi bypass (Shivpuri Bypass and NH25) \nSection D  Jhansi\u2013Orai including Jhansi bypass (NH25)  131 \nSection E  Orai\u2013Barah (NH25)   62 \nkm = kilometer, NH = national highway. \nSource: National Highways Authority of India. \n \n3.   Project implementation commenced in the second half of 2005 for sections A\u2013D, and for \nsection E in the second half of 2006. Completion was scheduled for the first half of 2008 for \nsections A\u2013D and in 2009 for section E. Implementation of sections A\u2013D is funded by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Section E is being \nimplemented  with  private  sector  participation  as  a  build-operate-transfer  project,  with  the \nconcessionaire paid through annuity payments over the concession period. The Project is being \nimplemented in 13 contract packages\u20146 contract packages were substantially completed by \nthe end of 2008, 4 packages are expected to be substantially completed by 2009, and the \nremaining 3 in 2010.  \n \nB.   Traffic Forecast \n4.  Traffic volume and growth rates adopted in the previous analysis have been reviewed. \nPassenger vehicles traffic observed ranges from 2,000 to 2,500 in sections A\u2013D and about \n3,300 in section E. Goods vehicles traffic observed was very low in sections A and B (below \n1,000) and fairly high in sections C, D, and E (over 3,000). Sections A and B are to the west of \nnational highway (NH)3; and sections C, D, and E are to the east of NH3, a major north\u2013south \nroute  linking  Mumbai  and  Delhi.  The  sections  west  and  east  of  NH3  show  distinct  traffic \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2003.

In sections B and D, the growth rate projected in the previous analysis was 7.7% for \npassengers, 6.5% for goods, and 7.0% for total traffic during 2003\u20132010. The observed growth \nrate is much higher than the projected rate in section B while the observed growth rate in \nsection D is lower than the projected rate. Section B was in very poor condition as well as \nhaving bad geometry and an intermediate lane. The survey was conducted about 39 kilometers \n(km) from Kota in contract package RJ-11, which was substantially completed in October 2008. \nA  substantial  increase  in  traffic  was  observed  because  such  a  section  was  substantially \nimproved to a four-lane road, coupled with the robust economic growth in India in that period. \nTherefore, the additional traffic can be attributed to generated traffic. The generated traffic \ncontribution is estimated to be about 25%\u201330%, which is normal with upgrading of a single or \nintermediate lane carriageway in poor condition to a dual two-lane carriageway.  \n \n6.   In section D, the generated traffic contribution expected is negligible, based on the \nassessment of travel conditions. The traffic count was carried out about 30 km from Jhansi \ntoward Orai in contract package UP-4. Construction in this section is considerably delayed and \nprogress so far is about 50%. This may have affected traffic growth in this section. Another \nmajor contributory factor to a lower growth rate could be the effect of the economic slowdown on \nrecent counts. The economic slowdown is reported to have reduced traffic, especially long-\ndistance traffic, which is reflected in the current counts in section D. The observed total traffic of \n6,725 vehicles in section D is about 8% lower than the projected traffic level for 2008 using 2003 \ntraffic  and  projected  growth  rates.  The  reduction  in  traffic  level  because  of  the  economic \nslowdown is likely to be more than this, based on the general assessment of the situation. This \nindicates that projected traffic growth rates could have been achieved in section D if not for the \nrecent economic situation.  \n \n7.  Truck traffic volume in 2003 in section B was very low and the origin\u2013destination survey \nindicates only very local traffic using the road because of its poor condition. On the other hand, \nsection D had a high truck traffic volume (above 3,000). A large portion of this was long-distance \ntraffic, which has been affected by the economic slowdown.   \n \n8.  The current economic slowdown is expected to continue through 2010 or even 2011 and \nthen  recover.  Therefore,  traffic  growth  rates  adopted  in  the  earlier  analysis  are  slightly \n ", "Appendix 7     27 \n \nmoderated (Table A7.3) and used in the current analysis along with the base year traffic of 2003 \nprojected for all sections to arrive at the normal traffic for the analysis. The growth rates were \nmoderated based on the observed trend for the 2003\u20132008 period and the growth trends of \ndifferent vehicle types in the recent past. It is observed that the growth rate of two wheelers and \nthree wheelers is slowing down, and the growth rate of cars is rising. In goods traffic, the growth \nrate of larger vehicles is rising on national highways.  \n \nTable A7.3: Annual Traffic Growth Rates (%) Adopted for Present Analysis \nLight  Trucks \nTime  Car/  Three  Two  Articulated \nBus  Commercial  (2 and 3  Tractor \nPeriod  Jeep/Van  Wheeler  Wheeler  Trucks \nVehicles  axle) \n2004\u2013\n7.0  6.5  7.0  5.5  6.0  5.5  5.5  4.0 \n2010 \n2011\u2013\n8.0  6.0  7.0  6.0  6.5  6.5  6.5  4.0 \n2020 \n2021\u2013\n7.0  5.0  6.0  5.0  6.0  6.0  6.0  3.0 \n2030 \n2031\u2013\n6.0  4.0  5.0  4.0  5.0  5.0  5.0  3.0 \n2040 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n9.  The review of project reports prepared in 2003 has indicated the potential for traffic \ndiversion when the corridor is fully built, especially to sections A and B. The project corridor \nprovides a much shorter route for traffic between Gujarat (western part) and the project corridor \narea in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh and beyond. Because of the narrow roads and poor \ncondition along the project corridor, this traffic is currently using NH8 and NH2 or NH59, NH3 \nand NH25. The distance saving by diverting to the project corridor for traffic between Gujarat \nand Uttar Pradesh is about 200 km.  \n \n10.  In  the  absence  of  a  detailed  origin\u2013destination  survey  on  these  alternate  routes, \navailable origin\u2013destination survey data on potential alternate routes have been studied to \nassess the potential. The origin\u2013destination survey results from NH79 near Bhilwara and on \nNH76 between Udaipur and Chittorgargh give a good indication of the traffic diversion potential. \nAnalysis of origin\u2013destination data2 shows that about 398 goods vehicles on this alternate route \nare potential candidate traffic to divert to the project corridor.  \n \n11.  Potential divertible traffic using the NH59 and NH3 route go through the NH25, which is \npart of the project corridor beyond Shivpuri toward Jhansi and Orai. The magnitude of this traffic \ncould be 10% of the traffic observed on the project corridor.   \n \n12.  Traffic levels along the project corridor indicate lower traffic levels in sections A and B, \nand higher traffic levels in sections C, D, and E. The overall traffic level and traffic distribution \nare also similar in these two groups. Sections A and B had mostly a single to intermediate lane \ncarriageway and very poor road surface and geometry. Sections C, D, and E mostly had a two-\nlane carriageway. Upgrading of the roadway will improve traffic flow conditions drastically and \nthis is likely to induce additional traffic. Considering the very poor condition of sections A and B, \ngenerated  traffic  is  considered  in  addition  to  normal  and  diverted  traffic.  Generated  traffic \nestimates are normally assessed based on elasticity of travel demand to transport cost. The \nupgrading is estimated to reduce the vehicle operating cost by an average of 34% for cars \n(including time savings) and 23% for trucks. With travel demand elasticity of 1.0, this will result \n                                                 \n2  The Louise Berger Group, Inc. 2008.

The \nobserved change in traffic growth in sections A and B also indicates a similar generated traffic \ncontribution. Based on both these assessments, generated traffic is assumed to be 30% for \npassenger  traffic  and  25%  for  goods  traffic  for  sections  A  and  B.  No  generated  traffic  is \nconsidered for sections C, D, and E\u2014to be on the conservative side\u2014as the existing project \nroad sections are well utilized. \n \nC.   Economic Analysis \n13.  The economic analysis was conducted for the project corridor to reassess the economic \nviability of the Project in light of the construction delays and cost increase. The economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of the project corridor as a whole was calculated on the basis of \nincremental economic costs and benefits resulting from the Project over an assumed period of \n30 years of operation. In addition to the benefit to normal traffic, benefits to the estimated \ngenerated traffic have been included in the analysis. Additional benefits to diverted traffic from \ndistance saving, if any, have not been included\u2014on the conservative side.  \n \n14.  Construction and Maintenance Costs. The construction costs have been calculated \nbased on the costs already incurred and projected to complete the construction. Estimated \nfinancial construction costs for completion of the Project, as reported by the NHAI project \nimplementation units, were used for each of the years since 2005 when the subprojects began. \nThe costs considered do not include the price escalation and all costs are valued at 2005 \nprices. \n \n15.  The  economic  costs  of  implementing  the  Project  are  based  on  the  financial  cost \nestimates as stated above, and include civil works, environmental improvement works, land \nacquisition, relocation of utilities, resettlement costs, and construction supervision. A standard \nconversion factor of 0.90 was applied to the financial construction cost to arrive at the economic \nconstruction cost.  \n \n16.  The routine maintenance cost was assumed to be the same in both without- and with-\nproject cases as in the earlier analysis. Periodic maintenance costs were considered every \n5 years for a renewal course for both with- and without-project cases, and a structural overlay in \n20 years in the with-project case.  \n \n17.   Benefits.  Upgrading  of  the  project  corridor  to  a  four-lane  highway  will  provide  a \ndesirable level of service for the project analysis period of 30 years; and will provide improved \ntraffic  flow,  higher  vehicle  speeds,  and  shorter  travel  time\u2014all  resulting  in  lower  vehicle \noperating costs. Economic benefits estimated include vehicle operating cost savings (as a result \nof better roads and increased vehicle operating speeds) for all vehicles (normal and generated \ntraffic), and time savings for cargo traffic. The value of passenger time was not considered\u2014on \nthe conservative side. The upgrading is expected to reduce traffic accidents. However, higher \nspeed may increase traffic accidents in some cases. This has not been included in the analysis \nbecause of the difficulty in estimating the net effect.  \n \n18.  The vehicle operating and time cost savings to traffic have been estimated using the \nhighway design and maintenance 4 model, with vehicle operating cost input data valued in 2005 \nprices to be compatible with the construction cost data. The fuel cost as obtained for 2005\u20132006 \nwas used. Where such cost data were not available for 2005, they were estimated from 2008 \nprices assuming 5% inflation during the period. \n \n ", "Appendix 7     29 \n \n19.  Economic Internal Rate of Return. Economic evaluation was carried out for the whole \nProject. Sections A and C were assumed to be substantially completed by the end of 2008. \nSection B is expected to be substantially completed by mid-2009, section D by mid-2010, and \nsection E by the end of December 2009.

The economic analysis indicates an acceptable EIRR for the investment.

The cost estimate used is the incurred cost. \n ", "Appendix 7     31 \n \nSince the Project as a whole is over 80% complete, very little variation in cost estimate is \nanticipated. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for (i) generated traffic reduced by 50%, (ii) \nbenefits from time savings reduced by 50%, (iii) overall benefits reduced by 20%, and (iv) a \nhypothetical  scenario  of  completion  as  scheduled  in  the  original  contracts.

The sensitivity analysis results show that the quantified economic benefits are robust to \nvarious sensitivity tests. Therefore, it can be concluded that the overall Project is justifiable in \nsocial cost benefit terms. The Project as a whole is almost 80% complete, so no further change \nin projected time or cost of completion is anticipated. The projects should have completed in \n2008 in accordance with the original contract schedule, but the delay only has an insignificant \nimpact on the overall economic analysis results.  \n \n22.  Financial Analysis. Financial analysis was carried out for all the sections using the \nfinancial model developed as part of the National Highways public-private partnership (PPP) \nproject. Financial analysis considered the financial construction cost, costs associated with \nimplementation as a PPP project, toll collection and operating expenses, routine and periodic \nmaintenance expenses on the cost side, and toll revenue on the benefit side. The net of costs \nand benefits are used to calculate the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the total Project.  \n \n23.  The FIRR for the entire corridor was calculated on the basis of incremental financial \ncosts and benefits resulting from the Project over an assumed period of 30 years of operation, \nwith a residual value proportional to the estimated remaining economic life. Financial costs are \npresented in 2005 constant prices. Project costs comprise capital costs and operation and \nmaintenance costs. Capital costs include civil works; environmental improvement works; land \nacquisition, relocation of utilities, and resettlement costs; construction supervision; and taxes \nand duties. Capital costs are taken based on actual disbursement starting in 2005. Operation \nand maintenance costs include annual routine maintenance cost (estimated at Rs180,000 per \nkm), annual operation cost (estimated at Rs8.0 million per toll plaza) and periodic maintenance \nundertaken every 5 years (estimated at Rs5.4 million per km) and 20 years (estimated at \nRs16 million per km and implemented over 2 years).  \n \n24.  Toll revenues are based on the base traffic levels and traffic growth rates in Table A7.3 \nand have been estimated using 2008\u20132009 toll levels for national highways3\u2014Rs0.65 per km for \ncars; Rs1.05 for light commercial vehicles and minibuses; Rs2.20 for 2-axle trucks and large \nbuses; and Rs3.45 for trucks with more than three axles, assuming a capture ratio of 80%.  \n                                                 \n3  Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways. 2008. National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and \nCollection) Rules.  New Delhi. \n ", "32     Appendix 7 \n \n \n25.  The results of the financial analysis are in Table A7.7. The FIRR is estimated at 5.8%. \nTo  assess  whether  the  investment  can  be  financially  sustainable  for  NHAI,  through  toll \ncollection, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for NHAI has been assessed. NHAI\u2019s \nWACC  was  assessed  at  about  6%4 (assuming  85%  government  funding  through  taxation \nrevenue, loans, and grants; and 15% through issue of capital gains tax-free bonds). Further, \nassuming a domestic long-term inflation rate of 5% and a long-term debt rate of 9%,5 NHAI\u2019s \nmarginal WACC in real terms is estimated at about 2.5%. The financial analysis indicates a \nFIRR higher than this rate for the project corridor with a 30-year operation period, so the Project \nis financially sustainable.  \n \n26.  The results of the sensitivity analysis on various cost and revenue assumptions are in \nTable A7.8. These confirm that, for NHAI, the Project can recover the investment through tolls \nwith a FIRR well above its average cost of capital in real terms. Section E is being implemented \nas a build-operate-transfer project with annuity payment, in which the concessionaire is paid a \nfixed amount over the concession period. Based on the analysis, NHAI will be able to recover \nthe cost of implementing the Project if NHAI decides to recover the investment through tolls with \na FIRR well above its marginal WACC.  \n                                                 \n4  Approximately equal to 10-year Treasury bond rate and coupon rate for tax-free bonds. \n5  Based on the publicly traded triple-A corporate bond rate as of January 2009. \n ", "Appendix 7     33 \n \nTable A7.7: Financial Analysis\u2014Annual Cost and Benefit Streams for the Whole Project \n(all amounts in Rs million) \n \nRoutine \nInvestment  Periodic \nYear  Maintenance   Toll Revenue  Net Revenue \nCost  Maintenance \nand Operation \n2005  2,058.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  (2,058.3) \n2006  6,175.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  (6,174.8) \n2007  10,291.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  (10,291.3) \n2008  11,761.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  (11,761.2) \n2009  8,880.0  79.3  0.0  387.0  (8,572.0) \n2010  2,000.0  158.6  0.0  1,547.8  (610.8) \n2011  0.0  158.6  0.0  1,903.6  1,745.0 \n2012  0.0  158.6  0.0  2,029.1  1,870.6 \n2013  0.0  158.6  0.0  2,163.0  2,004.4 \n2014  0.0  158.6  3,429.5  2,305.7  (1,282.4) \n2015  0.0  158.6  0.0  2,457.9  2,299.3 \n2016  0.0  158.6  0.0  2,620.1  2,461.5 \n2017  0.0  158.6  0.0  2,793.2  2,634.6 \n2018  0.0  158.6  0.0  2,977.7  2,819.1 \n2019  0.0  158.6  3,429.5  3,174.4  (413.7) \n2020  0.0  158.6  0.0  3,384.3  3,225.7 \n2021  0.0  158.6  0.0  3,588.9  3,430.4 \n2022  0.0  158.6  0.0  3,806.0  3,647.5 \n2023  0.0  158.6  0.0  4,036.3  3,877.7 \n2024  0.0  158.6  3,429.5  4,280.6  692.5 \n2025  0.0  158.6  0.0  4,539.7  4,381.1 \n2026  0.0  158.6  0.0  4,814.6  4,656.0 \n2027  0.0  158.6  0.0  5,106.1  4,947.6 \n2028  0.0  158.6  5,144.3  5,415.4  112.6 \n2029  0.0  158.6  5,144.3  5,743.6  440.7 \n2030  0.0  158.6  0.0  6,091.6  5,933.1 \n2031  0.0  158.6  0.0  6,400.0  6,241.4 \n2032  0.0  158.6  0.0  6,724.0  6,565.4 \n2033  0.0  158.6  0.0  7.064.6  6,906.0 \n2034  0.0  158.6  3,429.5  7,422.5  3,834.3 \n2035  0.0  158.6  0.0  7,798.6  7,640.0 \n2036  0.0  158.6  0.0  8,193.9  8,035.3 \n2037  0.0  158.6  0.0  8,193.9  8,035.3 \n2038  0.0  158.6  0.0  8,193.9  8,035.3 \n2039  (24,699.0)  158.6  3,429.5  8,193.9  29,304.9 \n        FIRR  5.8% \n( ) = negative.
