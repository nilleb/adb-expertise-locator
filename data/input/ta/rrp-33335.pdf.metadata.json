A  technical\nassistance (TA) grant will be provided on approval of the SSSDP.\nRationale From  1921  to  1990  Mongolia  achieved  high  levels  of  human\ndevelopment with no recorded poverty. Since 1990 poverty levels\nhave risen to over 35 percent, with real unemployment estimated\nat over 17 percent. Among the most adversely affected are the\nelderly, disabled, children, and single parent families. Government\npolicy for poverty reduction is to (i) reduce unemployment, (ii)\nprovide essential social welfare services for the most vulnerable\nwho are incapable of working, and (iii) provide social insurance\nservices to support working people at risk of falling into poverty.\nCivil  society  has  also  become  active  in  addressing  poverty\nthrough providing informal social security services.\nHowever, much of the formal social security system has shown\nitself to be increasingly ineffective. In particular, its emphasis on\nuniversal  coverage  has  proven  unsustainable  given  severe\nbudgetary constraints. Average disbursements to more than the\nover 228,000 beneficiaries of the Social Assistance Fund in 2000\namounted to just $3.82 equivalent per person per month. There is,\ntherefore, an urgent need to focus public resources more on the\npoorest to allow for increased levels of assistance per beneficiary.\nIn addition, the Government needs to mobilize communities and\nto work with the private sector to increase resources and improve\nefficiency  of  social  services  provided  to  the  most  vulnerable.\nCombating  unemployment  is  hindered  by  the  low  coverage  of\nemployment  services,  including  retraining  and  job  counseling,\nwhich reach only a small proportion of the unemployed. The ability\nof social insurance systems to prevent people from falling into\npoverty has also been curtailed by the falling number of people\ncontributing  to  the  schemes  and  employers\u2019  low  levels  of\ncompliance with compulsory contributions. Arrears of public sector\nagency social insurance payments exceed $3.1 million equivalent.\nReform is, therefore, necessary to ensure that the social security\nsystem can serve Mongolia\u2019s needs. Top priorities must be the\nmaintenance and improvement of social welfare services for the\nmost vulnerable: the elderly, disabled, and children, and single-\nparent families. At the same time, the system needs to help the\nunemployed  and  underemployed  to  find  productive  and\nsustainable jobs.", "ii\nExternal support is required for restructuring the social security\nsystem given the Government\u2019s financial and technical capacity\nconstraints,  including  lack  of  experience  in  market-based\nsystems. This process will require investments at both policy and\ninvestment levels for social welfare, employment promotion, social\ninsurance, and improved sector planning. Loan resources will be\ndirected at establishing effective and sustainable social security\nsystems in line with the development requirements of modern\nMongolia.\nClassification Core Poverty Intervention\nThematic: Human Development\nEnvironmental Category  C:  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no\nAssessment significant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\nThe Sector Development Program\n    Objectives and Scope The sector goals are to reduce poverty and increase security\namong  vulnerable  groups  by  increasing  employment  and\nproviding essential social security services for those incapable of\nworking. The specific purpose of the SSSDP is fully compatible\nwith the sector goals and aims to strengthen the social security\nsystem\u2019s  ability  to  deliver  essential  welfare,  insurance,  and\nemployment services to the ultra poor, very poor, and those close\nto the poverty line.\nAs a core poverty intervention, the SSSDP will include both direct and\nindirect poverty interventions. Policy reforms to social welfare services\nand benefits, employment services, and social insurance systems\n(unemployment and occupational injury and disease insurance), will\ndirectly benefit up to 820,000 people, of whom 72 percent live below\nthe  poverty  line.  Primary  beneficiary  groups  are  people  with\ndisabilities, the elderly, female-headed households, the unemployed,\nand children in difficult circumstances. The SSSDP will contribute to\nhuman development by providing employment-oriented education and\ntraining for the unemployed and vulnerable groups, including people\nwith disabilities. The SSSDP will also improve the quality of life for the\npoor who depend on social welfare services by improving existing\nservices  and  developing  community-based  social  welfare  services\nmore sensitive to local needs and demands.\nThe  investment  project  will  directly  assist  2,500  poor,  especially\npeople with disabilities and the elderly in difficult circumstances, by\nupgrading nursing services and the National Center for Rehabilitation\nof the Disabled. In addition, three pilot social security centers will\nimprove service provision to more than 5,000 poor clients. Targeting\nthe extremely poor, the investment project will initiate community-\nbased projects supporting 4,000 people. The investment project will\nalso aim to promote employment of the poor by educating and training\n14,000  unemployed  people  and  developing  essential  employment", "iii\nadvisory and counseling services.\nDevelopment of a social security master plan will indirectly benefit\npoor  people  by  improving  social  welfare,  social  insurance,  and\nemployment services. The intervention will contribute to a shift from\nuncoordinated short-term interventions to a more effective system,\nwhich will address poverty reduction on a sustainable basis.\nThe SSSDP will consist of a policy program with four policy areas and\nan  investment  project  with  four  components.  Associated  with  the\nSSSDP will be an advisory TA for strengthening policy for social\nsecurity reform.\n     Policy Framework The  SSSDP  will  support  the  development  of  comprehensive\n     and Actions poverty reduction policies focusing on employment promotion and\nthe provision of essential social welfare and insurance services to\nthe most vulnerable, who are unable to work. The SSSDP will aim\nto  improve  the  quality  and  coverage  of  services  through\nstrengthening Government capacities and fostering the role of the\nprivate sector in providing social security services, in a bid to\nmobilize additional resources and to achieve greater efficiencies.\nThe  SSSDP  will  also  promote  long-term  strategies  for  the\ndevelopment of social security in Mongolia, covering a 10-year\nperiod.\nThe policy loan will support (i) improving the quality and coverage\nof social welfare services and benefits, (ii) developing pro-poor\nlabor  market  policies,  (iii)  strengthening  participation  in  social\ninsurance  (unemployment and occupational injury and  disease\ninsurance), and (iv) developing a social security master plan.\n      Capacity Building Capacity building is included in each component of the investment\nproject,  including  support  for  central  and  local  government\nagencies,  and  nongovernment  and  community-based\norganizations.\n      The Investment Project The investment project shares the same structure as the policy\nprogram portion of the SSSDP and focuses on reducing poverty\nthrough promoting employment while addressing the needs for\nsocial welfare and insurance services of the most vulnerable. The\nproject aims to develop the Government\u2019s capacity to provide high\nquality services and to expand coverage while fostering the role of\nthe private sector in service development and provision.\nThe project has four components with several subcomponents.\nThe  social  welfare  component  includes  (i)  developing  and\nupgrading  social  welfare  service  facilities  for  the  elderly  and\ndisabled, (ii) developing community-based social welfare services,\nand (iii) strengthening the State Social Welfare Agency\u2019s capacity\nfor social welfare management. The employment promotion and\nimprovement of working conditions component includes support", "iv\nfor (i) demand-driven skills training for the unemployed and poor;\n(ii) entrepreneurship development for the unemployed and poor;\nand  (iii)  capacity  building  for  employment  services  and\nimprovement  of  working  conditions,  including  support  for  the\nCentral Employment Regulation Office and the Labor and Social\nWelfare  Inspection  Agency.  The  social  insurance  component\nincludes support for (i) social insurance management in the State\nSocial Insurance General Office, and (ii) training social insurance\ninspectors  at  provincial  and  district  levels.  The  project\nmanagement support component  will  assist  the  executing  and\nimplementing  agencies  in  the  efficient  and  effective\nimplementation of project activities.\n     Social and Social  and  environmental  assessments  indicated  that  no  SSSDP\n     Environmental elements  will  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  poor,  or  on  the\n     Measures environment.  The  integrated  package  of  policy  measures  and\ninvestments in social security services will both directly and indirectly\nbenefit the poor and the unemployed living throughout the country.\nThe Policy Loan\n     Loan Amount and A loan of $8 million equivalent is proposed from ADB\u2019s Special\n     Terms Funds  resources  to  support  the  policy  program,  to  meet\nadjustment costs of $9.5 million. The loan will have a maturity of\n24 years including a grace period of 8 years. Interest will be\ncharged at 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent thereafter.\n     Program Period and The  loan  will  be  used  over  four  years  from  the  date  of  loan\n     Tranching: effectiveness. The loan funds will be disbursed in three tranches,\nthe first of $2 million and two subsequent tranches of $3 million\neach. The first tranche will be released upon loan effectiveness.\nThe second tranche will be released 24 months after the initial\ntranche, when five conditions have been met. The third tranche\nwill be released when four more conditions are met, 48 months\nafter release of the first tranche.\n      Executing Agency The Ministry of Finance and Economy\n      Procurement The proceeds of the policy loan will be used to finance the foreign\nexchange cost of items produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s\nmember countries (other than items specified in a negative list\nand imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources).\nEligible  items  will  be  procured  through  normal  commercial\npractices  by  the  private  sector  or  standard  Government\nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  procurement  by  the  public\nsector.\n      Counterpart Funds The counterpart funds will be used to support the costs of the\npolicy program. Any counterpart funds not required for the policy\nprogram will be used first to finance local currency costs of other\nADB-financed  projects  and,  second,  for  general  development", "v\npurposes.\nThe Investment Loan\n       Loan Amount and The total project cost is $10 million equivalent. The proposed ADB\n       Terms loan is for $4 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources.\nThe loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period\nof 8 years.

The TA is estimated to cost $0.72 million equivalent,\ncomprising  $0.45  million  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $0.27\nmillion equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will provide $0.6\nmillion on a grant basis to finance the entire foreign exchange\ncost and part of the local currency cost.", "vi\n     Risks and safeguards Although  the  Government  is  committed  to  the  policy  measures\nsupported by the SSSDP, a potential risk to the policy program is a\ndelay in implementing policy actions due to institutional constraints of\nsocial  security  agencies  or  unexpected  socioeconomic  problems.\nSafeguards include a three-tranche structure to encourage sustained\npassage  of  reforms  and  a  period  of  one year  between  the  third\ntranche and the end of the program to give adequate time for the\ncompletion of the reform program. In addition, most of the policy\nmeasures are integrated with components of the investment project\nand  associated  TA,  so  that  support  is  indirectly  provided  for\nimplementing the policy measures.\nA potential risk for the investment project involves the provision of\nadequate counterpart financing. The governance program approved\nby ADB in 1999 will, however, reduce such risks by improving public\nexpenditure management.\nThe successful implementation of the project will also depend on the\ncapacity of the social security agencies at national, provincial, and\ndistrict levels. All project components, however, comprise capacity\nbuilding and training activities to address this issue. In addition, the\nproject management support provided under the investment project\nincludes assistance for improving monitoring and evaluation systems.", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on two proposed\nloans to Mongolia for the Social Security Sector Development Program (SSSDP). The Report\nalso describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Policy for Social Security\nReform, and if the proposed loans are approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority\ndelegated to me by the Board, shall approve the TA.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In  1996,  the  Government  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  to\ndevelop an investment proposal for poverty reduction and social protection activities to address\nthe needs of the poor, including the most vulnerable1, the unemployed, and those at risk of\nslipping into poverty. In response, ADB undertook a sector review in mid-1997 and approved a\nTA to support the design of a sector development program (SDP) proposal for social safety net\nstrengthening.2  Although the 1998 country assistance plan included the proposed Social Safety\nNet SDP, the SDP was removed from the pipeline because the Government was dissolved on\n24 July 1998. Processing of all proposed loan projects was halted until ADB could confirm\ninvestment priorities with the Government.\n3. In February 2000, the Government reiterated its request for ADB assistance to support\nthe social safety net. Other key stakeholders also confirmed the need to reform the social safety\nnet to help reduce poverty. An ADB fact-finding mission subsequently visited Mongolia in April\n2000 to define the objectives and scope of the Social Safety Net SDP.\n4. Following general elections in July 2000 and the formation of a new Government by the\nMongolian People\u2019s Revolutionary Party, a preappraisal mission was fielded in November 2000\nto review the proposed SDP taking into account changes in priorities and policy directions of the\nnew Government, changes in ministerial structures, and the Poverty Partnership Agreement\n(PPA) between the Government and ADB. Agreement was reached on revising the objectives\nand overall scope of the SDP to focus on a narrower range of issues in the Government\u2019s social\nsecurity system.3 The SDP\u2019s name was changed to the Social Security SDP (SSSDP).\n5. The ADB appraisal mission was fielded in February 2001.4 To ensure full consultation\nwith all stakeholders a national consultative workshop was held in April 2001. Members of\nparliament, local and central government officials, civil society organizations, the private sector,\nand the international funding community endorsed, and provided extensive feedback on the\nscope and activities of SSSDP.\n6. This report is based on the various TA reports; consultations with the Government, civil\nsociety,  international  organizations,  and  other  stakeholders;  findings  of  the  Mission;  and\nsubsequent work by ADB staff. Appendix 1 presents the program framework.\n                  \n1 The most vulnerable groups are  the elderly, disabled, children and single-parent families.\n2 TA 2978-MON: Social Safety Net Strengthening, for $985,000 approved on 31 December 1997.\n3 The principal elements of the system are (i) social welfare (ii) social insurance (iii) employment promotion and\ncreation and (iv) ensuring minimum standards for working conditions\n4 The mission consisted of (i) R. Schoellhammer, Mission Leader; (ii) G. Altay, Senior Counsel; (iii) L. Kulp, Social\nSector Specialist; (iv) T. Konishi, Programs Officer; and (v) S. Wendt, Social Development Specialist.", "2\nIII. THE SECTOR\nA.  Macroeconomic and Social Context\n1. Macroeconomic Context\n7. Since the beginning of the transition in 1990, Mongolia has made great progress in\ndeveloping a democratic form of government and a market-based economic system. During the\nfirst  four  years  of  adjustment,  the  economy  contracted  sharply  due  to  the  withdrawal  of\nassistance from the former Soviet Union, equivalent to about 30 percent of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), and the break up of the trading system with the member countries of the Council\nfor  Mutual  Economic  Assistance.  The  collapse  of  the  state  budget  led  to  drastic  cuts  in\nsubsidies  and  welfare  programs.  Furthermore,  economic  restructuring  and  the  privatization\nprocess led to a severe retrenchment in public sector employment, and to the closure of many\nnonviable enterprises. Although much of the labor force shed was absorbed by the extensive\nlivestock sector, and by the growing informal economy, unemployment and poverty increased\nrapidly.\n8. From 1994 to 1999 the economy recovered, with real GDP growth averaging 3.6 percent\nannually.  The  source  of  growth  was  primarily  a  private-sector-led  recovery  in  agriculture\nfollowing the privatization of livestock, manufacturing, and services. In 1996 the Government\nadopted  an  ambitious  reform  program  to  complete  the  transition  to  a  market  economy,\naccelerate growth, and reduce poverty. Key elements of the program included reducing inflation,\nliberalizing prices, streamlining the public sector, developing the private sector, and establishing\na restructured social security system. As a result, private sector activity increased sharply and\nexports grew as terms of trade improved in 1997. The exchange rate stabilized and inflation fell\nfrom 47 percent in 1996 to 20 percent in 1997. In 1997 Mongolia joined the World Trade\nOrganization and most import taxes were abolished.\n9. However, in 1998 the terms of trade deteriorated following the financial crises in Asia\nand the Russian Federation. Lower tax revenues and undermining bank loan portfolios and thus\ncontributing to severe problems in the banking system. Political uncertainty, resulting in two\nchanges of Government, undermined Mongolia\u2019s capacity to respond to these external changes.\nThe fiscal deficit widened to 12 percent of GDP, from 9 percent in 1997, and the togrog\ndepreciated by 11 percent against the United States dollar. Despite external shocks and political\ncrises, the economy continued to grow and inflation declined to 6 percent. But the number of\nhouseholds  living  below  the  poverty  line  remained  almost  unchanged,  suggesting  less\ninequitable growth. 5\n10. In 1999, economic growth was sustained at 3.5 percent and income per capita reached\nan estimated $435 equivalent. Mainly due to the disruption of oil supplies from the Russian\nFederation and increasing world market prices for petroleum products, inflation picked up and\nreached 10 percent by the end of the year. The exchange rate depreciated by 19 percent thus\ncontributing to a reduction in the trade balance from 15 percent of GDP in 1998 to 9 percent in\n1999. Fiscal performance improved in 1999 as a result of a package of revenue measures, and\nthe external imbalance and the budget deficit were increasingly met by external borrowings at\n                  \n5 According to the Government\u2019s income-based poverty line, 26 percent of the population was living below the\npoverty line in 1998. Living standards measurement surveys carried out in 1995 and 1998 estimated that in both\nyears about 36 percent of the population lived below the expenditure based poverty line.", "3\nlong-term concessional rates. By the end of 1999, the external debt had grown to 78 percent of\nGDP, and official development assistance contributed to 30 percent of the budget.\n11. According to the action plan of the new Government that came to power in July 2000,\nthe economic policy during the next four years will focus on continuing and deepening economic\nreform and accelerating economic growth. This includes ensuring macroeconomic stability;\nsetting  up  a  sound  banking  system  and  financial  sector;  restoring  domestic  industries;\npromoting exports, in particular livestock and raw materials; and developing infrastructure.\n12. Major  achievements  in  macroeconomic  management  during  the  second  half  of  the\n1990s include the control of inflation and continued growth; however, short to medium term\neconomic prospects are uncertain. The dependence of the economy on the export of a few\nprimary commodities, such as copper, gold, and cashmere, makes the country vulnerable to\nexternal shocks and contributes to the weakness of the external account. The extremely harsh\nwinters  of  1999-2000  and  2000-2001  have  resulted  in  the  loss  of  close  to  20  percent  of\nMongolia\u2019s livestock, which may have far reaching implications for growth and poverty reduction\nin the coming years. Tax revenue collection needs to be improved to strengthen the fiscal\nposition and direct foreign investment should be encouraged. The banking system continues to\nbe relatively weak, and the range of available financial services narrow, thereby constraining\nprivate sector development and employment growth.\n2.  Social Context\n13. Under the command economy before 1990, the social sectors in Mongolia received high\nlevels  of  investment  and  fiscal  support.  Access  to  employment  was  nearly  universally\nguaranteed and there was no recognized unemployment. Health and education services were\nwidespread and accessible because of the high priority the Government placed on human\ndevelopment. The social security system was based on a combination of consumer subsidies,\nuniversal benefits supported by the central budget, and state sector wages. All sectors of\nsociety were covered by the pension system and the state also provided a comprehensive\nrange of social protection benefits to families, children, and groups designated as \u201cvulnerable.\u201d\nAbout 40 percent of Government expenditures were devoted to social development.6\n14. Following transition, the Government made steps to change the social welfare system\nfrom provision of universal access to targeted interventions. Expenditures on social security\nremained relatively high, at 16.5 percent of total public expenditures in 1998. Despite these\nefforts, the social welfare system, which covers retirement, disability and survivor pensions,\nwork  injury,  unemployment,  maternity  benefits,  health,  social  insurance  system,  and  the\nNational Poverty Alleviation Program (NPAP) has had limited success in reducing poverty.\n15. The 1995 and 1998 Living Standards and Measurement Surveys showed incidence of\npoverty stable at about 36 percent, with about 20 percent of the population living in extreme\npoverty.7 The last official estimate showed that poverty was disproportionately urban, with 57.2\npercent of the poor residing in urban and 42.8 percent in rural areas. However the weather-\ninduced  shock  of  the  harsh  storms  in  the  winters  of  1999-2000  and  2000-2001  and  the\nintervening drought in the summer of 2000 has had a deleterious impact on the rural population.\n                  \n6 Mongolia, A Poverty Reduction Strategy for ADB Operations in Mongolia, May 2000.\n7 From the 1998 Living Standards and Measurement Survey. The survey is based on an expenditure-based poverty\nline for an intake of 2,100 kilocalories, which is comparable to other developing countries.", "4\n16. Growth in income poverty since 1990 has been accompanied by a concomitant decline\nin the ability to fill basic needs. Malnutrition among children under five and low birth rates have\nraised concerns about food security. Previous achievements in education have been eroded.\nEnrollment in grades 1 to 8 declined from near universal levels at 99 percent in 1990 to 82\npercent  in  1997.  While  concerted  efforts  by  the  Government  resulted  in  an  increase  in\nenrollment rates to 90 percent, the decline in the intervening years has produced a large\nnumber of children whose capacities in the long term have been impaired by the years of lost\neducation.\n17. The official unemployment rate is 6.5 percent8 (39,000 people), but actual levels are\nundeniably higher and are estimated (after adjusting for persons employed outside the formal\nsector) at 17-23 percent of the population. The provinces in particular have suffered from\nmassive layoffs of workers by private firms and the public service. Also, the incidence of young\npeople being unable to find work is increasing, with severe social and economic consequences.\nLoss of employment is the most prevalent trigger of poverty in Mongolia;9 nearly 58 percent of\nthe unemployed are poor.\n18. The Government has identified orphans, the physically handicapped, single pensioners,\nfemale-headed households, households with more than four children, the unemployed, and\nsmall-scale  herders  in  remote  areas  to  be  particularly  vulnerable  to  poverty.  The  groups\nidentified as the poorest and most vulnerable include those who work outside the formal sector\nand hence find themselves ineligible for assistance from the formal social security system.\n19. However, the most important source of social security for the very poor and vulnerable\ngroups  remains  the  informal  safety  nets  through  extended  kinship  networks,  usually  from\nyounger to older members of the family. This is particularly strong in rural areas, but has\nincreased  in  urban  areas  as  a  result  of  the  dramatic  rural-to-urban  migration  during  the\ntransition. Growing inequality has modified the nature of kinship networks, often turning them\nmore into patron-client relations, as poorer relatives offer their labor to wealthier kin in exchange\nfor food and other services.\n20. During  the  transition,  the  economic  and  social  independence  of  women  has  been\nseverely  undermined.  More  women  than  men  were  released  when  state  factories  closed.\nKindergartens  have  become  costly  or  have  closed,  maternity  homes  have  closed,\nunemployment benefits have been limited in duration and are inadequate. Reduction in health\nand/or social services results in women having to spend more time caring for the young, sick,\nand elderly. In practice women tend to have less job security than men and less access to\ninformation  and  credit.  In  1998  in  Ulaanbaatar,  the  proportion  of  poor  female-headed\nhouseholds (44 percent) was more than twice the proportion of male-headed households (21\npercent).\n21. Women account for 52.2 percent of the unemployed.10 Women were the first to be laid\noff during restructuring of the processing, service, and trade industries, industries where women\nwere  predominantly  employed.  After  the  disintegration  of  Government-owned  farms  and\n                  \n8 The official definition recognizes only people who have registered with the labor registry as unemployed. This\nexcludes first time-labor market entrants ineligible for labor registry services and those who perceive no value in\nregistering. Hidden unemployment is estimated at 12 percent (footnote 6).\n9 Participatory Living Standards Assessment, Draft, 2000\n10The National Convention on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) Watch Network Center, 2001", "5\nprivatization of livestock and machinery, more than 20,000 trained women lost their jobs.11 Only\n40 percent of women receive any social benefits as compared to 60 percent of men.\n22. A survey conducted by the National Center for Rehabilitation for the Disabled in March\n2001 showed that Mongolia had 115,000 people with disabilities (PWD). Of an estimated 39,700\nPWD capable of working, only 5,200 (13.1 percent) were actually employed. The unemployment\nrate of PWD is therefore, extremely high at 87 percent. Due to the massive deterioration of\nsocial welfare and social insurance services for PWD since 1991, 50 percent of PWD live in\npoverty, 60 percent of them women. Although legislation to protect and support PWD is fairly\nwell developed, implementation is inadequate due to severe budgetary constraints. In the first\nthree quarters of 2000, 20,085 PWD received disability pensions from the Ministry of Social\nWelfare and Labor (MSWL). However, the assistance to which they are entitled is inadequate\nand forces them to rely on relatives and/or charity for support.\nB.  The Social Security Sector\n1. Overview\n23. Despite  acute  budgetary  constraints,  the  Government  is  working  to  maintain  the\nachievements of the socialist period while restructuring the overall social sector to meet tight\nfiscal constraints and the new concept of the state\u2019s role. Prior to the transition, social services\nwere  fully  funded  by  the  state  through  its  central  ministries  with  semistate  and  semiparty\norganizations12 responsible for the delivery of services. However, since 1990, the old system\nhas collapsed as semistate organizations disappeared. In response, the Government created a\nnew  social  security  system  comprising  three  key  elements  (i)  social  welfare  services  and\nassistance benefits, (ii) employment services, and (iii) social insurance.\n24. Extensive  legislation  governs  the  social  security  sector,  although  effective\nimplementation has been constrained by acute resource constraints. MSWL has the central\npolicy role for the social security sector and is responsible for ensuring the welfare of vulnerable\ngroups such as the children, elderly, poor, and disabled. MSWL has six specialized agencies\nresponsible for the implementation and regulation of social insurance, social assistance, and\nemployment and labor markets. An organization chart for MSWL and its agencies is provided in\nAppendix 2.\n2. Social Welfare Services\n25. A number of laws define social welfare service provision in Mongolia.\n(i)  The Social Welfare Law (November 1998) regulates provision of social welfare to\nvulnerable  groups  including  the  disabled,  very  poor,  poor,  elderly,  orphans,\nparents with many children, and single elderly or disabled persons unable to live\nindependently.\n(ii)  The Elderly Persons Social Welfare Law (November 1998) defines requirements\nfor the elderly to be eligible for social welfare services and discounts.\n                  \n11Situational Analysis of Women in Mongolia, 2000, Draft. United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM).\n12State-funded autonomous entities: included the Women\u2019s Federation, National Children\u2019s Committee, Veterans\u2019\nAssociation, Youth Federation and Red Cross, which maintained branches nationwide at provincial and district\nlevel guaranteeing almost universal coverage.", "6\n(iii)  The Disabled Persons Social Welfare Law (November 1998) defines eligibility\nrequirements for the disabled for social welfare services and discounts.\n26. The  State  Social  Welfare  Agency  (SSWA),  established  in  April  1997,  is  the  lead\norganization for the delivery of social welfare services and social assistance benefits. SSWA\ndelivered such assistance to over 228,000 people in 2000. The assistance comprises:\n(i)  in-kind services including residential facilities for the elderly and disabled as well\nas services for the poor and homeless such as feeding and bathing;\n(ii)  discounts  to  the  elderly,  disabled,  and  other  groups  to  reduce  the  costs  of\nhousing, health care, wheelchairs, and hearing aids; and\n(iii)  monetary benefits from the Social Assistance Fund (SAF), including short-term\nbenefits for pregnancy and delivery, child care and infant nursing, support for\nadopting orphans as well as for families with large numbers of children, and long-\nterm pensions for those not eligible for pensions from the social insurance funds\n(due to insufficient contributions having been made). Many benefits are means-\ntested, based on a living-standard minimum that in 2000 was $12-$16 equivalent\ndepending on the region.\n27. SSWA has a national vertically structured delivery mechanism comprising the central\nSSWA office plus social welfare and service centers in nine districts of Ulaanbaatar and 21\nprovinces, and social welfare inspectors in 341 districts.13 As in many transition countries, the\nprovision  of  in-kind  social  welfare  services  is  dependent  on  the  institutionalization  of\nbeneficiaries. These include residential facilities under SSWA such as (i) 11 nursing homes for\nelderly and disabled persons (about 500 residents), and (ii) sanitoria for short-term (2-3 weeks)\nmedical care for the elderly. Children use sanitoria facilities in the summer. The National Centre\nfor Rehabilitation of the Disabled under the MSWL is concerned with rehabilitation and training\nof  people  with  disabilities.  In  addition  to  the  services  offered  by  SSWA,  the  Ministry  of\nEducation, Culture and Science (MECS) is responsible for residential and day care services for\ndisabled and orphaned children. Approximately 800 children reside in MECS homes. In addition,\na number of national and international nongovernment organizations (NGOs), have established\nhomes for children in especially difficult circumstances.\n28. Given the high costs14 and debatable benefits of institutionalization, the Government is\nmoving  to  increased  promotion  of  community-based  approaches15  and  away  from\ninstitutionalization. Key features of community-based approaches are as follows:\n(i)  Emphasis on preventive rather than reactive measures. By identifying potential\nsocial problems in advance, mitigating measures can be taken earlier and will be\nmore effective. For this, a system of social workers with a broad mandate will\n                  \n13The district government officer in charge of social policy is responsible for social welfare inspection, employment\nand poverty issues.\n14For example, a total of about $250,000 equivalent is spent annually on the 500 residents of 11 state nursing\nhomes, amounting to $500 per resident, a figure higher than Mongolia\u2019s annual GDP/capita.\n15One key example is with street children. Although some donors have expressed interest in establishing homes for\nstreet  children,  the  Government  is  concerned  that  this  could  provide  an  incentive  for  children  in  difficult\ncircumstances to leave home. As such, the preferred policy is to place children in need with foster families.", "7\nneed to be established to work at the community and family levels. Mongolia\ndoes not currently have such a system.\n(ii)  Use  of  community  resources  to  supplement  state  resources.  With  acute\nbudgetary constraints, mobilizing additional community resources can have a\nsubstantial impact on increasing coverage of services. This can include involving\ncommunity service organizations in delivering services to vulnerable groups or\nraising funds at the community level to meet essential needs. Mongolia has a\nwealth  of  suitable  community-based  organizations  throughout  the  country\nincluding  district-based  offices  of  national  NGOs  such  as  the  Veterans\u2019\nAssociation, National Children\u2019s Committee, and Youth Federation.\n(iii)  Improved quality of life for beneficiaries of social welfare services. By delivering\nservices in a decentralized manner, beneficiaries are able to stay within their own\ncommunities.\n(iv)  Improved efficiency of service delivery. By eliminating the large overhead costs\nof  centralized  institutions,  the  costs  of  service  delivery  will  decline.  If  real\nexpenditure levels are maintained, greater numbers of vulnerable groups could\nreceive  essential  services.  Targeting  of  beneficiaries  can  be  done  more\neffectively at the community level given the greater levels of transparency.16\n29. Since 1990, the number of NGOs has increased significantly in the country. Mongolia\ncurrently has more than 400 registered domestic and international NGOs. Although not all are\neffective, most are filling gaps in social service delivery especially to vulnerable groups. Many\nGovernment and international donor programs in the social sector are contracted out to and\nimplemented by NGOs that have proven highly effective in promoting and strengthening the\ncommunity mobilization aspects of projects and raising public awareness at the local level.\n3.  Employment Services and Worker Safety\n30. The Central Employment Regulation Office (CERO) is the primary agency responsible\nfor providing employment services to the unemployed. These include information and advisory\nservices as well as support for direct job placement (e.g., through public works) or organization\nof training courses for the unemployed. CERO has 20 staff in its central office responsible for\n117 staff throughout the country in 29 employment regulation offices (EROs).\n31. The EROs are the primary point of contact for the unemployed in their search for jobs.\nHowever,  availability  of  services  is  restricted  to  only  a  small  proportion  of  the  de  facto\nunemployed, due to complex registration requirements. To be formally registered with EROs, a\nworker must have contributed to the unemployment insurance fund for two years prior to being\nunemployed,  or  have  worked  continuously  for  the  preceding  nine  months.  These  criteria\neffectively  exclude  the  young  and  recent  school  graduates  with  no  work  experience,  who\ncomprise the majority of the population looking for work, and people working in the informal\nsector. Consequently in 2000 only 8,842 people, 23 percent of the formally unemployed were\neligible to receive employment services. However, as most unemployment is unrecorded, fewer\nthan 8 percent of the de facto unemployed are likely to be able to avail of employment services.\n                  \n16Of the roughly 100 residents in the state nursing home for the elderly in Huvsgul, fewer than 40 percent actually\nmeet the eligibility criteria for residency at the home", "8\n32. Training for employment is a key element of the Government\u2019s active labor market\npolicy. The MSWL is responsible for organizing such training and contracting training providers\nfor this purpose. The dominant training institutions for this purpose are the 24 MECS vocational\ntraining and production centers, which are located around the country. By design, the centers\ncater primarily for formal full-time vocational training courses for pupils in grades 8 to 10 (where\napproximately 10,000 students are currently enrolled). Nonformal vocational training provided\nby the public and private sectors together with NGOs has expanded rapidly in recent years and\nis supported by the Centre for Nonformal education under MECS. During the 4-year National\nProgram for the Development of Nonformal Education, nearly 30,000 people have participated\nin short-term skills training aimed at promoting employment and entrepreneurship. On-the-job\ntraining  by  private  sector  employers  is  rare,  partly  due  to  the  lack  of  any  tradition  for\napprenticeships or similar schemes but primarily because of the lack of resources to organize\nstructured training programs.\n33. Established in 1996, the Labor and Social Welfare Inspection Agency (LSWIA) is the\nregulatory agency under MSWL responsible for occupational safety and health. LSWIA has a\nstaff of 25 in the central office and 1 to 2 in each province. It has a wide range of functions\nrelated  to  labor  issues,  particularly  with  ensuring  compliance  with  the  Labor  Law,  and  is\nresponsible  for  monitoring  wage  rates,  hours  of  work,  and  industrial  relations;  inspecting\nworking conditions in industrial establishments to ensure they meet safety standards; monitoring\nemployment injuries and occupational disease insurance; and assessing loss of capacity for\nPWD claiming insurance benefits (whether under employment injuries or normal disabilities\ninsurance). LSWIA is also responsible for monitoring the implementation of laws and regulations\ngoverning all social insurance and social welfare payments.\n4.  Social Insurance\n34. A number of laws define social insurance provision in Mongolia, including the\n(i)  Law on Unemployment Benefits provided by the Fund of Social Insurance (June\n1994), which governs eligibility for payment of unemployment benefits;\n(ii)  Law on Benefits provided by the Fund of Social Insurance Against Employment\nInjury  and  Occupational  Diseases  (January  2000),  which  governs  matters\nrelating to pensions, benefits, and other payments for employment injuries and\noccupational diseases; and\n(iii)  Law on Social Insurance (June 1999), which defines the branches of social\ninsurance and its operations, financing, and services.\n35. The  lead  Government  agency  responsible  for  social  insurance  is  the  State  Social\nInsurance General Office (SSIGO), established in 1994, with nationwide representation and a\nvertically organized delivery system. SSIGO has 22 staff at the central level, and 791 staff\nworking in 9 districts of Ulaanbaatar, 21 provinces, and in over 300 districts. SSIGO administers\nfive insurance funds including pensions, benefits, health, employment injury and occupational\ndisease,  and  unemployment.  The  funds  are  supported  by  insurance  fees  and  budgetary\nsubsidies. At present, 92 percent of the employed are covered by compulsory social insurance\nand 22 percent of herders and the self-employed are covered on a voluntary basis. Over 92\npercent of the population are covered by health insurance. Compulsory contributors and their\nemployers pay 29 percent of their salaries (10 percent and 19 percent, respectively) to the\nSocial Insurance Fund (SIF), while voluntary contributors pay only 11.5 percent of salaries.", "9\n36. Total expenditure for social insurance was $40.2 million equivalent in 1999 covering old\nage pensions, disability pensions, military retirees\u2019 pensions, survivors\u2019 pensions, temporary\nworking disability benefits, funeral benefits, professional disability pensions, work-related injury\nbenefits, and unemployment benefits and to approximately 650,000 beneficiaries. The largest\nexpenditure item was old age pensions, which received $15.3 million equivalent from the central\nbudget. In 2000, 327,702 people received financial disbursements from the SIF; 8,842 people\nreceived unemployment benefits; and 6,131 people receiving benefits and pensions for work-\nrelated injuries and diseases.\nC.  Constraints and Issues\n1.  Social Welfare Services\n37. Mongolia currently is attempting to maintain a complex and very extensive social welfare\nnetwork  on  minimal  resources.17  With  few  resources  available  in  the  SAF,  benefits  are\ncompletely inadequate to lift beneficiaries out of poverty. In 2000 228,014 SAF beneficiaries\nreceived an average of just $3.82 equivalent per month. In addition, well over 650,000 poor\npeople are unable to avail of even this support under the SAF. This is compounded by the fact\nthat a large number of SAF beneficiaries are not poor, as benefits are provided on a universal\nbasis. With little prospect of increased budgetary support, existing resources should be better\nfocused on the ultra poor and very poor who are not capable of working.\n38. Effective planning and targeting of scarce resources is, however, difficult given the lack\nof comprehensive data available to policy makers and planners. Although excellent information\non poverty exists at the district level, the processing of such information up to the central level is\nweak, which makes it difficult for planners to respond adequately to shifting patterns of demand\nfor social welfare services. Improved information systems are needed.\n39. With  regard  to  in-kind  services  (including  nursing  homes),  Mongolia\u2019s  reliance  on\ncentralized institutions for the elderly and disabled is costly, and limits coverage of services,\nexcluding many in need. While institutionalization may be required for a limited number of\npeople, a complementary system needs to be developed to expand service coverage. The\nGovernment  prefers  a  community-based  approach  whereby  services  are  developed  and\nprovided at the community level. In Mongolia this can typically be done at the district level.\nAlthough such approaches have been implemented in Mongolia in a limited manner, they are\nstill relatively new. They do, however, offer substantial scope for mobilizing vitally needed\nresources at the community level for the provision of social welfare services to the vulnerable in\ntheir own communities.\n2.  Employment Services\n40. During the socialist era, Mongolia had no recorded unemployment although, as in most\ncommand economies, underemployment was rife. During the early years of the transition, many\npeople lost their jobs as industries closed. In 2000, the working age population was 1.3 million,\nwith a labor force of 870,000, of whom 830,000 were formally employed. However, official\nunemployment figures remain low at just 6.5 percent in 2000 (about 39,000 persons) with urban\nunemployment especially high. This represents an improvement from 7.5 percent in 1997.\n                  \n17In 2000, the SAF administered more than 30 types of pensions and benefits with a total expenditure of $10.45\nmillion equivalent.", "10\nHowever, these figures represent only those unemployed formally registered with EROs. Recent\nMSWL  surveys  estimate  the  real  unemployment  rate  to  be  over  15  percent  with  148,000\nunemployed.\n41. Unemployment  is  serious  for  most  families  due  to  the  high  dependency  ratio  in\nMongolia. With approximately 47 percent of the population under 20 years of age, Mongolia\nfaces an acute problem of labor absorption. Current cohorts between the ages of 15 and 19 and\n19 and 24 constitute 11 and 10 percent of the labor force, respectively. Every year the country\nneeds to absorb 25,000 new workers into the labor market, making new job creation a major\nchallenge for the country.\n42. Of  the  de  facto  unemployed,  approximately  75  percent  have  no  professional\nqualification,  making  it  very  difficult  for  them  to  find  employment.  Many  of  the  poor  and\nunemployed also lack basic literacy and numeracy skills. Although the registered unemployed\nare entitled to a small grant for vocational training, the amount is considered too small to\npurchase suitable training. Adult education and training programs are also limited in number and\nnormally  confined  to  major  population  centers.  Although  there  is  a  nationwide  network  of\nvocational training institutions, their courses are geared to the vocational training needs of\nyounger  pupils  in  grades  8  to  10  and  to  general  education.  Their  capacity  for  providing\nemployment-related  training  is  limited  by  low  investments  over  recent  years.  As  a  result\ncurricula, methodology, materials, equipment, facilities need overhauling before training that\nbetter meets the requirements of labor markets can be provided. Although some training is\nprovided by the private sector, providers are limited by lack of access to suitable facilities,\nequipment, and materials as well as funds for contracting well-qualified trainers. To encourage\nthe private sector, the Government intends to promote contracting out of training services and to\nsupport  private-public  sector  partnerships  in  employment  promotion  and  entrepreneurship\ndevelopment.\n43. Advisory services also need reform, especially as they are available only to the few\nunemployed  registered  at  EROs.  Advisory  services  must  be  made  available  to  all  the\nunemployed,  and  EROs  need  to  develop  their  activities  to  cover  informal  and  formal\nemployment labor markets. Advisory services must also be expanded to help the unemployed to\ndevelop their own businesses; this can include providing information and counseling on sources\nof finance, legal provisions and obligations, and specific training for this purpose.\n44. Worker safety is of increasing concern with increases in informal sector employment and\nfew resources available to enforce adherence to relevant safety legislation. Although LSWIA\nexists for this purpose, its role is hampered by institutional inefficiencies and overlaps; for\nexample, the function most closely associated with the employment injury responsibilities of\nLSWIA (occupational diseases) is also covered by the Center for Occupational Diseases of\nSSIGO. Both are responsible for administration of the same piece of legislation, providing\ncompensation for victims of occupational diseases or employment injuries/disabilities. LSWIA\nstaff  need  to  be  better  trained  and  equipped  to  deal  with  issues  of  worker  safety  in  the\nincreasingly diverse environment of Mongolia\u2019s economy. Improved information systems will be\nessential for LSWIA to be able to effectively enforce employment legislation on worker safety.\n3. Social Insurance\n45. Mongolia retains a valuable social insurance system that could be vital in efforts to\nreduce poverty and prevent more people from falling below the poverty line. However, chronic\nunder funding means that the disbursements to the 327,702 beneficiaries in 2000 amounted to", "11\njust under $14 equivalent per month. Apart from general budgetary constraints, another reason\nfor the under funding is due to evasion of compulsory social insurance contributions. This has\nbeen  compounded  by  the  increasing  number  of  people  working  informally  and  in  self-\nemployment, areas not covered by social insurance schemes. In addition, the large population\nof nomadic herders is not covered by social insurance.\n46. Contribution and participation problems are not confined to these sectors. Arrears of\nstate  employers  currently  exceed  $3.1  million  equivalent,  despite  budgetary  allocations  for\nsocial  insurance  contribution  obligations.  Private  sector  employers  commonly  fail  to  meet\nobligations too, and account for $6.1 million worth of arrears. The ability of SSIGO to increase\ncompliance is hampered by the lack of information on employment records and the relatively\nlimited powers of social insurance inspectors to enforce compliance. Data available to taxation\nauthorities are not routinely available to SSIGO and social insurance inspectors do not  have\nsufficient investigative authority.\n47. Coverage of social insurance schemes needs to be expanded, particularly to the poor\nand unemployed. The current unemployment insurance system assists only a small proportion\nof the unemployed in terms of the provision of benefits and training. Currently, only about 20\npercent of the registered unemployed, and none of the unemployed in the informal sector, are\nable to avail of unemployment insurance benefits.18 With high levels of noncompliance, people\ninjured at work or afflicted with an occupational disease cannot seek compensation. They may\nalso find it difficult to gain alternative sources of income from social assistance benefits, given\nthe low coverage of this scheme.\n48. One of the principal issues concerns coverage of herders and the self-employed. The\nwinter storms of the last two years have demonstrated the vulnerability of these communities.\nDespite the potential benefits of participation in social insurance schemes, the feasibility of\nexpanding services to these communities must first be carefully examined, especially as many\nherders live in a barter economy and may not have the means with which to make contributions.\n4. Institutional Issues and Capacity\n49. Delivery and administration of social welfare and employment services and the payment\nof social welfare benefits and insurance across a sparsely populated country is costly in terms\nof human and financial resources. More appropriate and cost effective institutional structures\ncan be developed, especially at the local level. Clarification of the roles and responsibilities of\nthe various organizations within the social security sector is required to reduce overlapping\nresponsibilities and duplication of services.\n50. Capacities need to be developed across all organizations in the social security sector,\nespecially in the context of movement toward new systems of delivery. An important area that\nneeds  strengthening  is  information  collection,  analysis,  and  dissemination.  Systems  for\ninformation sharing among agencies and clients need to be improved. LSWIA, with limited staff\nand outreach, has to deal with over 30,000 enterprises with no existing information network\nbetween their offices and those of the agency. Related to this is the need to build capacity to\n                  \n18The minimum amount payable for unemployment insurance is equivalent to 75 percent of the minimum wage and\nbenefits are payable for a maximum of 76 days. The amount of benefits payable ranges from 45 percent of the\naverage of wages received in the last three months for a person with less than five years of contributions, to 70\npercent for those who have contributed for 15 years or more", "12\nevaluate different, new, and often innovative interventions within the sector, to learn lessons,\ndevelop best practices, and inform policy makers.\n51. Organizations need to develop the ability and willingness to cooperate more with civil\nsociety  organizations  and  with  the  private  sector  in  carrying  out  their  duties.  Equally,\ncoordination and linkages across ministries and agencies with the responsibility of different\nministries needs to be strengthened. Strengthening collaboration and cooperation between\nMSWL and MECS in training for employment is essential.\nD.  Government Expenditure\n52. In 2000 Mongolia spent $13.4 million equivalent on social security,19 amounting to 14.1\npercent of GDP. This marks a large increase since 1996 (8.7 percent of GDP), and reflects the\nincreasing number of ultra poor and very poor people in Mongolia. During the transition years,\nbudgets  for  health,  education,  and  social  security  and  welfare  as  a  percentage  of  GDP\ndecreased markedly. The decline continued until 1995, and not until 1996 was overall social\nsector expenditure increased. Expenditures for social protection from 1991-2000 are shown in\nAppendix 3. While overall social sector expenditures have increased since 1996,  education and\nhealth expenditures (in terms of GDP and total government expenditure) have declined since\n1991. At the same time, social security and welfare expenditures have increased from about 12\npercent of total Government expenditures in 1991 to nearly 18 percent in 2000.\nE.  Government Objectives and Strategies\n53. The 2000-2004 Action Plan of the new Government adopted in September 2000 outlines\nkey objectives in the main policy areas including economic, social, and regional and rural\ndevelopment policy. The stated objective in the plan is that it \u201cshall improve the wealth and\nincome distribution system, stall the decline in the living standard of the people, narrow the\nincome gap among social groups, and eliminate absolute poverty.\u201d Key elements related to the\nsocial security system include\n(i)  reducing the number of poor households living under the poverty line by half\nthrough  a  complex  set  of  social  and  economic  measures  to  prevent  living\nstandard decline and by providing jobs to poor citizens of working age, and\n(ii)  developing and strengthening a national social security system.\n54. The action plan includes other elements within the three areas of social security cover by\nthe SSSDP. Within social welfare, the plan aims to (i) improve social protection measures for\npoor and disabled people, and mothers with many children; (ii) increase the number and types\nof benefits and services rendered to senior veterans; and (iii) create favorable conditions for\nneglected children to live in their own homes and provide them with assistance and services.\n55. Within the area of employment promotion and worker conditions, the plan aims to (i)\nrevise and enforce the labor safety and sanitary standards in accordance with the Labor Law,\n(ii) provide unemployment insurance for uninsured people and professional training and labor\nmarket activities, and (iii) develop the content of vocational training and activities of centers for\nvocational training.\n                  \n19$6.91 million equivalent from the budget, $1.04 million from the SAF, and $5.44 million from the SIF", "13\n56. Within  social  insurance  the  plan  aims  to  (i)  expand  social  insurance  coverage,\nstrengthen the responsibility for timely payment of insurance contributions, and improve self\nfinancing of social insurance contributions; (ii) cover herders and the self-employed and improve\ntheir  social  protection;  and  (iii)  enforce  the  regulation  on  payment  from  the  occupational\ninjuries/diseases insurance fund of (a) benefits to people disabled by industrial accidents or\nprofessional sickness, and (b) expenses for the resulting care and treatment.\n57. To  identify  priority  interventions  and  reforms  required  within  the  action  plan,  the\nGovernment has developed the Good Governance for Human Security Program. The SSSDP\nwill contribute to achieving overall human security by reducing poverty and unemployment,\noptimizing  income  distribution,  and  improving  living  standards.  The  Government  is  also\ndeveloping an interim poverty reduction strategy that will lead the way to the development of a\nfull  poverty  reduction  strategy  program.  The  poverty  reduction  strategy  program  will  help\ncoordinate  all  interventions  aimed  at  reducing  poverty  and  integrate  social  security  sector\ninvestments and policy reforms into a comprehensive package for poverty reduction.\nF.  External Assistance to the Sector\n58. The SSSDP has been designed to be fully compatible with other external support for\nsocial security development. During preparation, close coordination was maintained with other\nfunding agencies including Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) of Germany,\nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  United  Nations  Development  Programme\n(UNDP), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), United States Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAID), and the World Bank to ensure optimal coordination and to benefit from\nthe experience of other agencies active in the sector. Although several other interventions are\nongoing in the broad field of social security, the SSSDP will make ADB the lead external agency\nin this field. Other agencies and their activities are described in the following paragraphs.\n59. In the social welfare subsector, support has been focused on the needs of vulnerable\nchildren.  UNICEF,  with  $6.1  million  financing  since  1997,  has  played  the  leading  role  in\nassisting (i) street and neglected children, and (ii) community-based rehabilitation of disabled\nchildren, in addition to its activities in health and education. UNICEF also supports community-\nbased interventions to help vulnerable groups. GTZ has provided $140,000 equivalent since\n1997 to assist street children and children in especially difficult circumstances. International\nNGOs,  including  Save  the  Children  Fund,  United  Kingdom,  and  World  Vision  are  also\nimplementing major activities focusing on vulnerable children.\n60. In  employment  promotion,  the  European  Union  (EU)  has  taken  the  lead  role  in\nstrengthening employment services through two grant-financed projects totaling $2.63 million\nequivalent. The EU observatory program has supported sustainable labor market analysis. GTZ\nis leading support to develop the formal vocational training system, with $1.12 million equivalent\nfinancing between 2000 and 2003. Under its $10 million Gobi Regional Economic Initiative,\nUSAID is supporting skills training and entrepreneurship development for the provinces in the\nregion of the Gobi Desert. In addition, UNDP, the Swedish International Development Agency\nand United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and Danish International\nDevelopment  Agency  are  providing  support  to  nonformal  training  for  employment.  The\nemployment promotion activities envisaged within the SSSDP will also be linked with existing\nexternally-supported microfinance schemes.20\n                  \n20These include the UNDP-supported micro-start program and other schemes supported by EU, GTZ, and USAID.", "14\n61. ADB has provided two advisory TAs to support reform in social insurance. Additional\nassistance  for  reform  of  pension  financing  is  being  provided  through  the  ADB-supported\nFinancial Sector Program.21 From 1997 to 2000, USAID provided $2 million in TA to promote\npension reform, with focus on capacity building of SSIGO. The SSSDP has been designed to\ncomplement and continue activities supported under these programs.\n62. The development of a social security master plan within the SSSDP with the support of\ninterested  funders  will  facilitate  donor  coordination  and  resource  mobilization  for  key\ninterventions in this area not covered by the current program. Major external agencies and\nprojects in support of the social security sector are listed in Appendix 4.\nG.  ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n1.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy\n63. The country operational strategy (COS) for Mongolia22 states that the objectives of\ngrowth and poverty reduction can best be achieved by focusing on five core sectors, one of\nwhich is the social sector (education, health, and social protection). The COS is foremost a\npoverty reduction strategy. This has been confirmed through the PPA signed by ADB and the\nGovernment in March 2000. The PPA aims to increase the productivity of the economy through\nimproved governance, and of the people through viable employment generation. The SSSDP is\nfully compatible with the principal elements of the PPA, which aims, inter alia, to provide for the\nspecific needs of different income groups as follows:\n(i)  for people above the poverty line but likely to become poor: skills development\nand labor advisory programs, and small enterprise development;\n(ii)  for the poor below but close to the poverty line: skills development and labor\nadvisory programs, small enterprise development, sustaining access to social\nservices, and developing social infrastructure;\n(iii)  for the very poor: training and labor advisory programs, sustaining access to\nsocial services, and developing social infrastructure; and\n(iv)  for the ultra poor: targeted assistance for the really vulnerable including PWD,\naged, orphans, and multi children households.\n64. ADB\u2019s strategy to reduce poverty is to (i) generate viable and widespread employment,\nparticularly  in  the  urban  and  provincial  centers  where  the  poor  and  unemployed  are\nconcentrated;  (ii) involve the private sector to deliver the needed employment opportunities; (iii)\nput in place a strong social security system for the very poor and vulnerable who might be\nbeyond the reach of the self-help opportunities; and (iv) maintain active social service delivery to\nthe poor and vulnerable, particularly in the rural areas, to prevent levels of deprivation from\nincreasing.\n65. Poverty  in  Mongolia  is  not  a  transitory  problem;  rather  it  is  a  structural  one.  The\nincreasing depth of poverty indicates that the current level of development and economic growth\n                  \n21Loan 1743-MON: Second Financial Sector Program, for $15 million, approved on 22 June 2000 (in cooperation\nwith the World Bank\u2019s $32 million Financial Sector Adjustment Credit).\n22Mongolia Country Operational Strategy, ADB, February 2000.", "15\nis inadequate to generate sufficient opportunities for viable employment and income, and the\npoor are sinking deeper into poverty through asset depletion and a breakdown in vital kinship\nnetworks. The SSSDP is well in line with the COS as it provides for a one-time intervention to\nestablish a strong security system for the very poor and most vulnerable who might be beyond\nthe reach of self-help opportunities. However, the SSSDP recognizes that social insurance and\nwelfare are not sufficient to reduce structural poverty in a sustainable way and hence addresses\npro-poor growth through promoting employment and income generation activities.23\n2.  ADB Experience\n66. Since Mongolia joined ADB in 1990, ADB\u2019s activities in the social security sector have\nincluded two advisory TAs to support social insurance development,24 one advisory TA to\nsupport the NPAP,25 and one preparatory TA to support the development of the SSSDP.26\n67. Experience from the social insurance TAs revealed the principal constraints facing this\nsubsector, including (i) low compliance with payments by individual and employers from both\npublic and private sectors; (ii) low coverage levels, with nomadic herders and the self-employed\nnot covered; and (iii) a need to enhance the capacity of social insurance management with\nfocus on SSIGO. Work under the TAs led to provision being made under the Second Financial\nSector Reform Program27 for pensions development and under the SSSDP for  unemployment\nand occupational injuries and diseases.\n68. Under the support for the NPAP, ADB gained experience working in poverty reduction,\nincluding  areas  such  as  employment  generation  and  social  welfare.  The  specific  areas  of\nactivity were to determine appropriate means of measuring poverty, and to update Mongolian\nagencies on cost-effective methodologies and techniques needed to implement the national\npoverty reduction activities. These activities highlighted the need in the social security sector to\nbetter identify and target the poor, including development of means-testing and management\ninformation systems, both of which are being addressed under the SSSDP. Activities related to\nthe NPAP also revealed the need to increase cost-effectiveness of social security programs by\nverifying that public spending is allocated for actual provision of social services and the need to\nensure that institutional structures are in place for the delivery of social security programs.\nFindings indicate that, overall, local structures (particularly those involving local NGOs with\nstrong  community  participation)  have  been  successful  in  achieving  beneficiary  impact,\naddressing local needs, and sustainability. These lessons have all been taken into consideration\nin the design of the SSSDP.\n69. The preparatory TA28 built on the findings of the previous TA interventions in designing\nthe SSSDP. In its preparation, support was provided for amending legislation in key areas,\nincluding  reform  of  the  Social  Welfare  Law  to  allow  greater  focus  on  community-based\napproaches for social welfare service deals as well as the drafting of a new employment law.\n                  \n23For a detailed poverty analysis refer to the poverty impact assessment (Appendix 5) and the ADB COS (footnote\n23) pp. 15-17 and Appendix 1.\n24TA 2252-MON: Strengthening Social Insurance, for $84,000, approved on 20 December 1994; TA 2371-MON:\nAdministrative Reform of Social Insurance, for $900,000, approved on 28 July 1995.\n25TA 2683-MON: Strengthening the National Poverty Alleviation Program, for $422,000, approved on 7 November\n1996.\n26TA 2978-MON: Social Safety Net, for $985,000, approved on 31 December 1997.\n27Loan 1743-MON: Second Financial Sector Reform Program, for $15 million, approved on 22 June 2000.\n28 Footnote 2.", "16\nEmphasis was also placed on making the SSSDP fully compatible with interventions of other\nagencies working on poverty reduction activities in Mongolia.\nIV. THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n70. From 1921 to 1990, Mongolia achieved substantial progress in human development.\nThese  gains  are,  however,  being  rapidly  eroded,  largely  through  declines  in  quality  and\ncoverage of social security and other social services, and poverty levels have risen sharply. The\nGovernment has responded though interventions such as the NPAP as well as commencing\nmajor  reforms  in  the  social  sector.  Civil  society  has  responded  well  to  the  challenges  as\nwitnessed by the rapid development of NGOs providing informal social security services. The\nnew Government has also adopted an action plan that sets reducing unemployment as the main\npillar of its bid to reduce poverty, while providing social welfare services to the most vulnerable\nand social insurance services to prevent people from falling into poverty.\n71. However, much of the formal social security system has shown itself to be increasingly\nineffective in Mongolia\u2019s move to a market-oriented economy. In particular, its emphasis on\ncash transfers to a large number of beneficiaries has proven unsustainable under the severe\nbudgetary constraints faced by the Government. In addition, employment promotion services\nand unemployment insurance systems reach only a small proportion of the de facto unemployed\nand even when they do so, are largely ineffective. Reform is, therefore, necessary.\n72. Top priorities must be the maintenance and improvement of social welfare services for\nthe most vulnerable groups of society to help them out of poverty and to ensure all their basic\nneeds are met. These groups are most affected by poverty. At the same time, the system needs\nto support the unemployed and underemployed to find productive, viable, and sustainable jobs.\n73. External  support  is  required  for  restructuring  the  social  security  system  given  the\nGovernment\u2019s  financial  and  technical  capacity  constraints,  including  lack  of  experience  in\nmarket-based systems. This process will require investments at both policy and investment\nlevels for social welfare, employment promotion, social insurance, and better sector planning.\nLoans will need to be directed at establishing effective and sustainable social security systems\nin line with the development requirements of modern Mongolia.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n74. The objective of the SSSDP is to reduce poverty among the most vulnerable groups of\nsociety through strengthening the social security system. The SSSDP will include direct and\nindirect poverty interventions, and poor people are expected to comprise at least 72 percent of\nthe beneficiaries. The primary strategic development objective is poverty reduction and the\nsecondary objective is human development. The SSSDP is fully in line with the COS, the PPA,\nand the Government\u2019s Action Plan.\n75. Improving  the  sustainability  of  the  social  security  system  is  a  principal  immediate\nobjective of the SSSDP. To ensure this, the SSSDP will seek to maintain real levels of public\nspending on social security and to mobilize additional resources, particularly at the community\nlevel. Simultaneously, the SSSDP will improve the effectiveness of the social security system for\npoverty reduction by better targeting of the poor while increasing the efficiency of services by", "17\nshifting focus more to preventative approaches at the community and family levels and away\nfrom reactive, centralized approaches.\n76. The SSSDP comprises a policy program with four policy areas and the investment\nproject with four components. Associated with the SSSDP will be TA for Strengthening Policy\nfor Social Security Reform.\nC. Policy Framework and Actions\n77. The policy reform agenda is designed to build on issues identified and addressed in\nprevious  TA  interventions  in  the  social  security  sector  in  Mongolia  as  well  as  from  the\nexperience of other agencies in this field. The policy loan will support essential reforms in social\nwelfare, social insurance, and employment services for poverty reduction and to enhance the\nsocial and economic security of vulnerable groups. It will also define a long-term vision and\nstrategic framework for the sector, through a social security master plan.\n78. The program of policy reforms is in line with the Government\u2019s action plan adopted in\nSeptember 2000, and will support several of the Government\u2019s planned initiatives. The program\nis also closely linked to the SSSDP\u2019s investment component. The development policy letter is in\nAppendix 6 and the policy matrix setting out the policy framework is in Appendix 7. The policy\nprogram will support the following:\n(i)  The program will help (a) rationalize the system of social assistance to focus\nresources on the poorest by modifying eligibility criteria to include only the poor\nand those at risk of poverty; and (b) develop community-based social welfare\nservice delivery mechanisms to mobilize additional resources for social security\nand improve access to, choice of, and quality of such services. Social work\nservices will also be reorganized to reflect the need for more flexible community-\nbased systems, which can work more on poverty prevention than on current\npractices, that focus on inspection and reporting.\n(ii)  The  program  will  help  develop  pro-poor  labor  market  policies,  including\nexpanding  the  eligibility  for  employment  services  (education  and  training,\ninformation and counseling services, public works programs) to the uninsured\nunemployed  and  to  the  poor.  New  education  and  training  programs  will  be\ndeveloped and provided in collaboration with the private sector. New programs\nwill  also  be  delivered  at  district  level29  in  collaboration  with  district-level\nsecondary schools.\n(iii)  The program will strengthen social insurance to increase the resources available\nfor insurance for unemployment and injuries and diseases. Related policy action\nincludes  strengthened  cooperation  between  SSIGO  and  the  State  Taxation\nGeneral  Office  (STGO),  particularly  on  information  sharing.  State  budgetary\norganizations will be required to clear social contributions\u2019 arrears amounting to\nmore than $3.1 million and the enforcement powers of the social insurance\ninspectors will be increased. A public education campaign will be launched to\nencourage  eligible  people  to  make  social  insurance  contributions.  As  self-\nemployed  people  including  herders  are  not  covered  by  the  existing  system,\noptions for including them will also be formulated.\n                  \n29The vast majority of training programs are available only in cities or at the provincial level and are out of reach of\nmost unemployed people.", "18\n(iv)  The  program  will  develop  a  medium-  and  long-term  policy  and  planning\nframework  for  the  social  security  sector.30  Related  policy  actions  include\nformulation and approval of a comprehensive 20 year sector master plan for\nsocial security. The strategy will be realized through a series of rolling programs,\neach of three years\u2019 duration. The Government will request all external funding\nagencies to provide support within the framework of this program. The master\nplan will also address the issue of program budgeting in the social security\nsector.\n79. During the National Consultative Workshop hosted by MSWL in Ulaanbaatar in April\n2001, policy measures under the SSSDP were discussed with the principal stakeholders in the\nsocial security sector (including parliamentarians, central and local government officials, social\nsecurity specialists, and representatives of NGOs and funding agencies). Valuable feedback\nwas provided and incorporated into the SSSDP design and full endorsement gained for the\nSSSDP.\nD.  Capacity Building\n80. The SSSDP\u2019s investment project will strengthen the Government\u2019s ability to oversee,\ncoordinate, and manage social security services. It will also boost the role of the private sector,\ncivil society organizations, and communities in service development and provision. To achieve\nthis, the SSSDP will support a comprehensive program of staff development to ensure that\nMongolia gains access to the highest levels of knowledge and experience of other countries in\nsocial  security  issues.  In  addition,  staff  will  be  supported  in  their  work  through  access  to\npertinent  reference  materials  and  systems,  including  facilities  for  information  and\ncommunications technologies (ICT). To combat the high turnover in Government staff, plans will\nbe developed to ensure optimum use of limited staff resources. The functions of MSWL and its\nspecialized agencies will be analyzed to identify means of improving service delivery.\n81. The SSSDP will also support the establishment and operation of benefit monitoring and\nevaluation systems to facilitate higher efficiency and effectiveness of social security services on\na sustained basis.\nE.  The Investment Project\n82. The investment project will address each of the three main elements of the social\nsecurity sector in Mongolia: social welfare, employment services, and social insurance in line\nwith the goals of the PPA to promote training and advisory programs and maintain social\nassistance and social services for the ultra poor, very poor, and those near the poverty line. It\nwill be implemented nationwide.\n1. Component 1: Social Welfare\na.  Development and Upgrading of Social Welfare Service Facilities\n83. Social welfare services for members of ultra-poor vulnerable groups will be improved\nunder the project. Specifically, support will be provided to improve the national system of\n                  \n30In the area of social insurance, the framework will cover only insurance for unemployment and occupational\ndiseases and injuries.", "19\nnursing homes for the elderly and disabled. The project will support a shift away from large,\ncentralized  institutions  to  smaller,  more  sustainable  community-based  facilities,  which  can\nsupport integration of vulnerable groups into the community. The project will support renovation\nof five community-based facilities;31 construction of new cost-efficient facilities;32 provision of\nfurniture, equipment, materials, staff training, and communications; and assistance for planning\nand management. Project consultants will help MSWL (i) draw up plans for the gradual phasing\nout of the centralized facilities at Batsumber and Huvsgul, and (ii) propose modifications to\nregulations on nursing homes to permit a more flexible approach to service delivery. The project\nwill improve rehabilitation services and supplies of artificial limbs and other aids for PWD by\nupgrading the National Centre for Rehabilitation of the Disabled, and identify options for the\nprivate sector to supply necessary items (domestic as well as imported products). Support for\nthe National Centre for Rehabilitation of the Disabled will include furniture, equipment, materials,\nstaff training, planning,  management, and marketing, and establishment of links with overseas\nentities. The improvement of nursing homes will be undertaken in close coordination within the\noverall strategy to develop more community-based approaches to social welfare delivery. The\nProject will also establish three pilot social security centers at provincial level. The centers will\noffer  the  full  range  of  social  security  services  in  one  facility.  The  number  of  expected\nbeneficiaries for the various activities under this component is provided in Appendix 1.\n      b. Development of Community-Based Social Welfare Services\n84. The project will support the development of community-based social welfare services\naimed at the ultra-poor and very poor (including the elderly, children, PWD and single-parent\nfamilies) through pilot-testing of innovative small-scale projects designed and implemented at\nthe  community  level  by  government  agencies,  NGOs,  individuals,  or  groups.  Maximum\nemphasis will be placed on contracting services to private sector providers, in line with reforms\nundertaken under the policy program. Eligible activities are aimed at the poorest and will include\nup to 4,000 beneficiaries during the project. Activities will include development and provision of\nday-care  and  preschool  services,  recreational  and  educational  services,  catering  services,\ncounseling and advisory services, accommodation-related services, and  skills training. Training\nand public education programs will also be provided to support the new activities, for which both\nprivate and public entities will be eligible. The small-scale subcomponents will be financed\nthrough a community social welfare innovation facility  to be established under the project. State\nagencies, NGOs, community organizations, groups, and individuals will be eligible to apply for\ngrants from the facilities up to a ceiling of $10,000 equivalent for community-based projects.\nFurther details of the facility are set out in Appendix 8. Lessons from the community social\nwelfare innovation facility subcomponents will support the development of a national strategy for\ncommunity-based social welfare service delivery and refinement of procedures for contracting\nout services to the private sector and identifying of the most successful practices.\n            c. Strengthening Social Welfare Management\n85. The efficiency and effectiveness of social welfare service and benefit delivery will be\nimproved  by  the  project.  Support  will  be  provided  to  help  SSWA  develop  management\ninformation systems, including provincial and district-level branches, to improve management of\nsocial welfare resources, and monitoring and evaluation of social welfare services and benefits.\n                  \n31Nine small-scale nursing homes are run by provincial administrations in addition to two large centralized institutions\nat Batsumber and Huvsgul. The five homes to be renovated are in accordance with the Government\u2019s Regional\nDevelopment Programme.\n32Although plans have not yet been finalized, the National Consultative Workshop proposed that in some cases tent\ncommunities could be established.", "20\nInputs will include modern ICT (which will be integrated with social insurance and employment\nservices\u2019 systems), equipment, furniture, materials, and support for planning and management.\nA  training  needs  analysis  will  be  conducted  among  officials  from  MSWL  and  SSWA  and\npersonnel from private sector agencies, Minor renovations will also be made to SSWA facilities\nat provincial level and in Ulaanbaatar to allow for increased efficiency of operations.\n2. Component 2: Employment Promotion and Improvement of Working\n           Conditions\n           a. Skills Training for the Unemployed and the Poor\n86. Following a labor market analysis and survey of the training needs of the poor, the\nproject will support the availability of demand-driven education and training courses for the\nunemployed and poor people who wish to upgrade or obtain skills and knowledge. Principal\ntarget groups will include the very poor, the poor below but close to the poverty line, and people\nabove  the  poverty  line  but  likely  to  become  poor.  Up  to  25  private  and  public  training\ninstitutions33 will be selected as employment training centers (ETCs) under the subcomponent,\nto provide capacity for training up to 5,000 participants per year. In addition, a network of 6\nregional resource centers will be established on the base of existing training institutions; these\ncenters will provide methodological support for ETCs and serve as training centers for staff from\nthe ETCs. Up to 40 interdistrict schools (schools that serve multiple districts) will also be\nselected as employment education centers and will provide basic skills and vocational education\n(including literacy and numeracy training) for up to 4,000 unemployed and poor people. The\nsubcomponent will support selected training providers with civil works, furniture, management\nsupport,  curriculum  and  syllabus  development,  learning  materials,  and  teachers\u2019  guides,\nprograms for training of trainers, training, and administrative equipment. The subcomponent will\nalso develop assessment systems and methodologies to enable trainees to receive formal\ncertification  on  successful  completion  of  training  courses.  To  support  the  sustainable\ndevelopment of the skills training programs, the subcomponent will support the establishment of\na national curriculum and methodological center for vocational and skills training within an\nexisting educational institution. The subcomponent is directly linked to policy reform regarding\nestablishment of a strategy for national training for employment.\nb.  Entrepreneurship Development for the Unemployed and Poor\n87. The subcomponent will support potential and existing entrepreneurs (who are classified\nas poor, unemployed, or likely to become poor) to develop and manage small enterprises.\nExisting advisory services will be reviewed and upgraded. ETCs will offer training in enterprise\ndevelopment to cover aspects such as (i) procedures for establishing a business, (ii) preparation\nof a business plan, (iii) availing of credit, (iv) basic accounting, (v) fiscal and legal obligations,\n(vi) production, and (vii) marketing. A system of business incubators will also be established\nwithin five pilot ETCs to support up to 750 new entrepreneurs in developing their businesses.\nThe  subcomponent  will  provide  ETCs  with  management  and  marketing  support,  basic\nproduction and management equipment, information materials, and programs for training of\ntrainers.  The  subcomponent  will  cooperate  closely  with  the  proposed  ADB-financed  Rural\nFinance SDP and GTZ to facilitate access of beneficiaries to microloans available under their\nmicrofinance programs.\n                  \n33These will include MECS Vocational Training and Production Centers as well as private sector and nonformal\ntraining providers.", "21\nc. Capacity Building for Employment Services and Improvement of\n              Working Conditions\n88. The subcomponents will enable CERO to develop management information systems,\nincluding province and district-level branches, to improve (i) management of resources for\nservices to the unemployed, and (ii) monitoring and evaluation of employment services. The\nsubcomponent will provide ICT equipment, management support, and a full program of staff\ntraining.  LSWIA  will  also  be  strengthened  through  provision  of  technical  equipment,  staff\ntraining, and development of new systems for improved monitoring of employment conditions\nand worker safety. Public education campaigns34 will also be undertaken to encourage the\nunemployed to avail more of employment services.\n 3.  Component 3: Social Insurance Management and Training\n89. The  component  will  support  upgrading  of  SSIGO\u2019s  capacity  for  managing  social\ninsurance  programs  by  providing  staff  training,  advanced  information  and  communications\ntechnologies, and information materials. Support will be provided for upgrading accounting\nsystems, and  strengthening the unemployment and occupational disease insurance programs.\nA study will also be conducted to identify mechanisms for including the self-employed in the\nsocial insurance system and to develop an action plan for expanding systems accordingly.\n90. A training needs analysis for provincial and district social insurance inspectors will also\nbe  conducted  to  assess  their  (i)  knowledge  of  most  recent  practices  and  procedures,  (ii)\ncomputer literacy and data processing skills, and (iii) management skills and client relations.\nBased on the assessment, a training program will be launched for up to 250 inspectors around\nthe country. The subcomponent will also support a public information campaign through the\nmass media on participation in social insurance schemes. The campaign will include provision\nof brochures, newspaper, television, and radio advertisements.\n 4.  Component 4: Support for Project Management\n91. The Project will establish a project management unit (PMU) in MSWL to support project\nimplementation. A sub-PMU will also be established in MECS to implement the skills training\nand entrepreneurship development subcomponents of the employment promotion component.\nThe PMU and sub-PMU will be responsible for day-to-day aspects of implementation in their\nareas of responsibility, including procurement, disbursement issues, reporting, and logistical\nsupport.  The  PMU  will  be  involved  in  technical  issues  related  to  the  project,  in  close\ncoordination with the relevant departments of MSWL and local administrations. The PMU will be\nstaffed by a project manager, project management adviser (international consultant for eight-\nperson-months),35  a  social  welfare  and  insurance  specialist,  a  procurement  officer,  an\naccountant, a secretary, and a driver. The sub-PMU will be headed by a project coordinator\n(duties will include responsibility for procurement) who will report to the project manager, and\nwill be staffed by a training specialist and an accountant. Each unit will be provided with the\nnecessary facilities and equipment, and a vehicle. Key PMU and sub-PMU staff will be trained in\nproject planning and management, monitoring, and evaluation. The component will also fund\nthe PMU\u2019s recurrent operational expenses under normal Government budgetary allocations.\nThe Project organization chart is provided in Appendix 9.\n                  \n34Public education campaigns will be conducted jointly with the social insurance component to ensure optimal\ncoordination.\n35With support from TA 2978 (footnote 28), MSWL has commenced recruiting the consultant.", "22\nF.  Social and Environmental Measures\n1.  Environmental Analysis\n92. No adverse environmental effects are expected from the SSSDP. Civil works will be\nmostly upgrading of existing social welfare facilities scattered throughout the country.\n2.  Social Analysis\n93. The social analysis  (Appendix 10) indicates that the SSSDP will improve the quality and\ncoverage of social assistance benefits and welfare services, employment services, and social\ninsurance for poor people, including vulnerable groups (para.18) in particular. The SSSDP will\nincrease the proportion of poor and vulnerable groups that are covered and the amount they\nreceive through improved means testing.\n94. The current system of welfare services for the elderly, PWD, and children in difficult\ncircumstances is highly centralized and institution based. The SSSDP will focus on development\nof community-based approaches to providing welfare services, to enable those requiring social\nservices to remain close to their communities. A community-based approach has proved very\neffective  in  targeting  the  intended  beneficiaries.  In  economic  terms,  a  community-based\napproach provides benefits, delivery costs will be reduced, and income generation opportunities\nfor the local economy will increase. A community-based approach is based on an understanding\nof peoples\u2019 vulnerability and needs, and of their assets and capabilities. Different groups in\ndifferent localities, will require varied types of interventions. To support a community-based\napproach, a new framework for social services is required to define the institutions, assign\nresponsibilities, and ensure proper training of social workers to adapt to the new system.\n95. One of the main factors contributing to the high poverty level in Mongolia is lack of\nemployment opportunities. Vocational and skills training is required to upgrade the skills of a\nlabor  force  that  has  been  trained  to  meet  the  job  requirements  of  a  command  economy.\nVocational and skills training is also essential for the many young people who need to enter the\nlabor market for the first time. There is a marked rural-urban disparity in access to training\nopportunities. By decentralizing vocational and skills training as suggested in the SSSDP, rural\nunemployed will have increased access to improve their skills and employment opportunities.\n96. The social analysis indicates that Mongolia has a large number of PWD who are capable\nof working. Mainstreaming PWD in vocational and skills training will provide these groups with\nincome opportunities, lift a significant number of PWD out of poverty, and integrate some\nexcluded groups in the mainstream of the economy.\n97. Social insurance systems have been recognized as important because they provide a\nbuffer against poverty. Many families in Mongolia depend almost entirely on the income from\ntheir social insurance (pensions), and all recipients of social insurance would be poor if they did\nnot receive their pensions. Almost 90 percent of pensioners are poor. At present 92 percent of\nthe employed are covered by social insurance on a compulsory basis. However, only 22 percent\nof herders and the self-employed are covered on a voluntary basis. Thus, most of these groups\nare vulnerable to loss of income due to illness, disability, work injury, and old age.\n98. Unemployment benefits from the social insurance system only cover 3 percent of the\nunemployed. The incidence of unemployment and number of unemployed is very high among", "23\nthe age group 15-25, who are ineligible for unemployment-related services through the labor\nregistry, and informal sector workers are not eligible for labor force registry services.\nV.  THE PROPOSED LOANS\nA.  The Policy Loan\n1.  Amount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n99. The proposed loan is for $8 million equivalent from the ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources,\nand will support the SSSDP policy program. The Borrower will be Mongolia. The loan will have a\nmaturity of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The interest charge during the grace\nperiod will be 1 percent per annum and 1.5 percent thereafter. The loan is expected to be used\nover 48 months, commencing from the date of loan effectiveness.\n100. Anticipated total costs arising from the policy reform program will exceed $9.5 million\nequivalent. This figure comprises structural adjustment costs, which are estimated as being at\nleast $6.5 million equivalent (Appendix 11) and costs of settling arrears pertaining to social\ninsurance  contributions  of  state  budget-funded  entities,  currently  amounting  to  about  $3.1\nmillion.  Structural  adjustment  costs36  will  result  from  the  following  policy  measures:  (i)\nrestructuring SSWA (including Ulaanbaatar, 21 provincial offices, and 341 district offices to\nimplement the reformed social welfare benefits\u2019 system targeting the ultra poor and very poor;\n(ii) commencing phasing out of centralized social welfare institutions and restructuring of SSWA\nto permit greater community-level service provision, including extensive contracting out to the\nprivate sector; (iii) restructuring of EROs, the vocational training system, and district-based\nschools to introduce employment-related education and training for the unemployed, including\nprovision for contracting out training services to the private sector; (iv) restructuring of the\nCERO and EROs so that uninsured unemployed people can avail of employment services; (v)\nrestructuring of SSWA and branches to develop a new community- and family-based social\nwork service; and (vi) restructuring of SSIGO and the STGO to permit greater information\nexchange and improved support to social insurance inspectors for enforcing payment of social\ninsurance contributions.\n101. The expenditure impact of reforms to social welfare services and benefits is expected to\nbe neutral. The expenditure impact on developing pro-poor labor market policies is expected to\nbe positive, due to the expansion of employment services to greater numbers of unemployed.\nThe establishment of new structures for development and delivery of employment services is\nexpected to increase expenditure. However, as existing structures will be used, the increase is\nexpected to be modest. The social insurance reforms are expected to increase revenues due to\nincreased levels of compliance and settlement of arrears. Increased costs of the reforms are\nexpected to be offset by greater efficiencies in the sector as a result of (i) improved policies and\ndevelopment  plans,  (ii)  greater  management  and  monitoring  capacity  within  government\nagencies, and (iii) contracting services to the private sector.\n                  \n36 Defined as one-time, nonrecurrent costs to finance reform to government and other agencies, institutions, and\nother structures and systems to reorient themselves in accordance with the demands of the reformed social\nsecurity system.", "24\n2.        Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n102. The  Executing  Agency  for  the  policy  program  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and\nEconomy (MFE). MFE will be responsible for initiating withdrawals under the policy loan, the\nuse of counterpart funds generated by the loan proceeds, and the monitoring of these funds.\n103. A steering committee for the SSSDP as a whole will comprise the Minister of Social\nWelfare  and  Labor  as  chair;  Vice  Minister  of  Finance  and  Economy  as  deputy  chair;\nrepresentatives from MECS, MFE, MSWL, and the Ministry of Health (including the project\ndirector);  and  appropriate  representation  from  stakeholder  groups  such  as  the  National\nChildren\u2019s  Committee,  Veterans\u2019  Association,  NGOs  representing  PWD,  and  employers\u2019\nrepresentatives. The steering committee will provide policy guidance for the investment project.\nThe steering committee will be established prior to loan effectiveness, and will meet as often as\nnecessary, but at least once every three months.\n3.  Procurement and Disbursement\n104. Eligible items will be procured through normal commercial practices by the private sector\nor standard Government procedures acceptable to ADB for procurement by the public sector.\nABD will ensure that standard procurement procedures used in the country are adequate from\nthe point of view of competition and efficiency.\n105. The proceeds of the policy loan will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost of\nitems produced in and procured from ADB member countries (other than those items specified\nin a negative list [Appendix 12] and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources).\nDisbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans, approved by\nADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 16 April 1998. With each withdrawal request, the Government will\ncertify that the value of Mongolia\u2019s total eligible imports is equal to or greater than the amount of\nADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit\nthe use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.\n4.  Counterpart Funds\n106. The local currency generated by the loan proceeds (i.e., the counterpart funds) will be\nused to support the costs of the policy loan program. Any counterpart funds not required for the\npolicy program will be used first to finance local currency costs of other ADB-financed projects\nand, second, for general development purposes.\n5.  Monitoring and Tranching\n107. MSWL will monitor the implementation of the policy program, and will prepare and\nsubmit  to  ADB  quarterly  reports  on  the  implementation  of  the  policy  matrix,  including  the\ncompletion of the actions set forth in the development policy letter and the policy matrix. The\nGovernment and ADB will review implementation semiannually, and assess the impact of all\nrelevant reforms on the social security sector and labor markets in particular and the economy\nin general. This will include active policy dialogue between the Government and ADB, and\nconsultations  with  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies  supporting  social  security\ndevelopments and employment promotion. On behalf of the Government, MFE in cooperation\nwith MSWL and MECS will monitor the implementation of policy reforms supported by the\nSSSDP. Training for monitoring and evaluation in MSWL and MECS will assist the Government", "25\nin monitoring program impacts. ADB will combine its reviews of the investment project with a\nreview of the implementation of the policy program.\n108. The loan funds will be disbursed in three tranches, the first of $2 million and two\nsubsequent tranches of $3 million each. This allocation of funds allows for a relatively slow start\nto the process of policy reform, given the capacity of key agencies. Once capacity building and\nother activities commence under the investment project and the attached TA, the Government\nwill be able to accelerate the reform process by the time the second and third tranches are due.\nThe three-tranche structure allows for a more sustained passage of reform over a longer period\nof  time,  which  is  essential  for  the  more  complex  policy  components  to  succeed.  Such\ncomponents  include  promotion  of  community-based  approaches,  rationalizing  of  social\nassistance  benefits,  and  expansion  of  employment  services.  In  addition,  the  three-tranche\nstructure will allow for improved monitoring of the implementation of reforms and their impact on\nthe poor. The first tranche will be released upon loan effectiveness. The Borrower has satisfied\nthree conditions prior to Board consideration of the program loan. The nine conditions for\nrelease of the second and third tranches, which are expected to take place 18 and 36 months\nafter the loan becoming effective, respectively, are set forth in the policy matrix (Appendix 7).\n109. The Government will fulfill the following second tranche conditions by 31 October 2003:\n(i)  in  consultation  with  ADB,  amend  the  Social  Welfare  Law  to  allow  for  more\ncommunity-based approaches to social welfare, including participation of civil\nsociety organizations and the private sector;\n(ii)  based on the related study and in consultation with ADB, introduce the necessary\nregulatory framework concerning eligibility of people to benefit from employment\nservices, including training;\n(iii)  SSIGO  and  the  STGO  will  design  and  implement  a  nationwide  program  of\nsharing data between themselves, in consultation with ADB; and\n(iv)  a social security master plan will be developed covering medium- and long-term\ndevelopment  of  MSWL\u2019s  mandated  areas  of  responsibility,  including  social\nwelfare, employment services, and social insurance (insurance to unemployment\nand occupational injuries and diseases).\n110. The Government will fulfill the following third tranche conditions by 31 October 2005:\n(i)  following  amendment  of  Social  Welfare  Law,  introduce  new  systems  for  the\ndistribution of social assistance benefits and means testing on a nationwide\nbasis, and, in agreement with ADB, allocate sufficient financial resources from\nthe budget and staff to implement the system;\n(ii)  develop a legislative framework satisfactory to ADB for providing training for\nemployment;  include  provision  to  promote  competition  between  public  and\nprivate organizations offering training services and to allow private sector training\nproviders to lease and operate state-owned training institutions, facilities, and\nassets;\n(iii)  develop procedures and criteria (including core standards) for accrediting public\nand private sector vocational and skills training entities; develop and maintain a", "26\ndatabase  of  accredited  providers;  and  develop  and  implement  supervision\nsystems to safeguard the quality of training in accredited institutions, to the\nsatisfaction of ADB;\n(iv)  in  consultation  with  ADB,  introduce  the  regulatory  framework  necessary  to\nensure full access to skills and vocational training for PWD, both in terms of\nphysical accessibility and suitability of courses, and establish mechanisms to\nmonitor implementation of the regulatory framework; and\n(v)  have MFE deduct the outstanding social insurance contributions owed by state\nbudget-funded  entities  from  budget  allocations  in  2004,  and  transfer  the\nresources to the appropriate social insurance fund as defined by the Social\nInsurance Law.\n111. The policy program also includes other conditions that ADB will require the Borrower to\nfulfill prior to the end of the Program (expected in October 2005).\nB.  The Investment Loan\n1. Amount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n112. The total project cost is $10 million equivalent. The proposed ADB loan is for $4 million\nequivalent,  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  32  years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years. Interest will be charged at 1 percent per annum during the\ngrace  period,  and  1.5  percent  thereafter.  The  Project  will  be  cofinanced  by  the  Nordic\nDevelopment Fund (NDF) on a parallel-financing basis. NDF will finance skills training and\nenterpreneurship development subcomponents under the employment promotion component.\nThe proposed NDF loan is for $4 million equivalent. The loan will have a maturity of 40 years,\nincluding a grace period of 10 years. A service charge of 0.75 percent per annum and a\ncommitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum will be levied. Project cost estimates are provided in\nAppendix 11 and summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ \u2018000)\nComponent      Foreign Local Total Percent of\n  Exchange Currency Cost Base Cost\nSocial Welfare\n830 1,314 2,144 25\nEmployment Services and 2,610 2,302 4,912 57\nWorking Conditions\nSocial Insurance 468 397 864 10\nProject Management Support 642 63 705 8\nPhysical Contingencies 455 408 862\nPrice Contingencies 109 204 313\nService Charge 200 200\nTotal 5,313 4,687 10,000", "27\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ \u2019000)\nSource Foreign Local Total Cost Percent\nExchange Currency\nAsian\n2,773 1,226 4,000 40\nDevelopment\nBank\nNordic 2,540 1,461 4,000 40\nDevelopment\nFund\nGovernment 0 2,000 2,000 20\n5,313 4,687 10,000\n            Total\n2. Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n           a. Executing Agency and Implementing Agency\n113. MSWL will be the executing agency for the investment project. The subcomponents on\nskills  training  and  entrepreneurship  development  will  be  implemented  by  MECS,  arranged\nthrough a joint order between MSWL and MECS outlining their responsibilities.\nb. Project Management Arrangements\n114. The Minister, MSWL, will appoint a project director who will assume responsibility for the\noverall execution and supervision of the project. The steering committee for the SSSDP (para.\n103) will be established prior to loan effectiveness, and will meet as often as necessary, but at\nleast once every three months. A PMU will be established in MSWL37 (para. 91), appointed by\nthe Government subject to ADB and NDF concurrence. A sub-PMU will also be established in\nMECS to implement the skills training and entrepreneurship development subcomponents of the\nemployment promotion component. Staff will be seconded from MSWL, SSWA, CERO, SSIGO,\nLSWIA, provincial and district administrations, MECS vocational training and production centers,\nnursing homes, and other social welfare facilities to ensure effective implementation of project\nactivities. MSWL will be requested to provide a staffing plan prior to loan effectiveness detailing\nstaff resources available to the project.\n115. The project director will be responsible for coordination with other externally-financed\ninterventions, including the Business Services Development Project financed by UNDP and the\nSwedish International Development Agency as well as with the GTZ Microfinance Program. The\nproject director will also be involved in coordinating the SSSDP with the proposed ADB Rural\nFinance Project and GTZ, to ensure that beneficiaries of training and other support under the\nSSSDP have facilitated access to support under their microloans program.\n                  \n37 MSWL commenced preparations for establishing the PMU in the latter half of April 2001, and appointed key staff\npositions to coincide with loan negotiations.", "28\n                       c.  Implementation Schedule\n116. The project will be implemented over five years in accordance with the implementation\nschedule  given  in  Appendix  13.  It  is  expected  to  commence  in  October  2001,  and  to  be\ncompleted by October 2006. Given MSWL\u2019s relative inexperience with ADB- and NDF-financed\nprojects, a relatively slow start to the project has been planned, with only 7.5 percent of funds\nprojected  for  disbursement  in  the  first  year  of  implementation.  This  will  allow  a  focus  on\nestablishment of project management, implementation, monitoring systems, and initial surveys\nand other analyses required to implement of the key project activities. Disbursement rates are\nexpected to peak in the third year, reaching 30 percent of total project funds.\n3. Procurement and Consulting Services\na. Procurement\n117. All procurement under the ADB loan will be accordance with ADB's Guidelines for\nProcurement. Procurement of equipment, furniture, vehicles, and materials will be awarded\nthrough  international  shopping  for  contract  packages  of  less  than  $300,000  equivalent,  in\naccordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Small  contracts  of  less  than  $100,000\nequivalent each may be filled by direct purchase. Local competitive bidding will be undertaken\nfor civil works contracts. The PMU will be responsible for overall procurement activities; the sub-\nPMU will be responsible for procurement activities under skills training and entrepreneurship\ndevelopment subcomponents implemented by MECS.\n118. Civil works under the Project will involve the construction, upgrading, and rehabilitation\nof social welfare and training facilities. These include (i) nursing homes for the elderly and other\nvulnerable groups, (ii) the National Center for Rehabilitation of the Disabled, (iii) technical and\nvocational schools, (iv) common premises for MSWL agencies, and (v) provincial and district\nsocial security centers. As these civil works components are relatively small and scattered\nthroughout the country they are unlikely to attract the interest of international construction firms.\nTherefore, procurement will be through local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB,\nwithout precluding interested foreign bidders from participating. Suitable contractors will be\nidentified through prequalification. Contractors will be required to give appropriate warranties for\ntheir work. Given the small size of many contracts, where the borrower has the capacity to\nundertake works expeditiously and at reasonable cost, a force account may be used. Similarly,\ncommunity participation in small-scale civil works will be promoted where applicable. Appendix\n14 shows the indicative contract packages for procurement.\nb. Consulting Services\n119. The project provides for a total of 50 person-months of international services and 153\nperson-months of domestic consulting. Consulting services will also be provided under civil\nworks contracts on a lump sum basis. The international and domestic consultants, with input\nduration ranging from 1 to 12 months, will support MSWL, its specialized agencies, MECS, and\nother social security entities covered by the project in all aspects of training and development.\nInternational consultants under the ADB loan will be selected and recruited in accordance with\nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Domestic consultants will be recruited by the PMU", "29\nunder  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB.38  The  terms  of  reference  of  the  consultants  are\nsummarized in Appendix 15.\n4. Disbursement Arrangements and Imprest Fund\n120. All forms of disbursements under the project will be carried out in accordance with\nGovernment and ADB guidelines and procedures. To expedite disbursement of loan proceeds,\nthe project will use an imprest account. The imprest account will be established in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements between the Government\nand ADB. The account will be opened by the PMU in a commercial bank to be selected\naccording to Government and ADB guidelines. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest\naccount will not exceed six months of project expenses and is estimated at $250,000.\n121. Statement of expenditure procedures will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures\nunder the project, and to liquidate advances provided to the imprest accounts in accordance\nwith procedures satisfactory to ADB and consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nEach individual payment reimbursed or liquidated under the procedures will not exceed $50,000\nequivalent for each item of expenditure.\n122. While  the  community  social  welfare  innovation  facility  will  be  governed  by  its  own\nspecific  procedures  (Appendix  8),  the  funds  for  this  development  facility  will  be  disbursed\naccording  to  the  same  guidelines  and  procedures  as  for  other  project  components.  Upon\napproval of proposals and by the technical committee, the PMU may use either the project's\nimprest account or submit withdrawal applications to ADB to release the required funds.\n5.  Anticorruption\n123. During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to Government\nofficials, including the need to ensure transparency and accountability in all project activities.\nThey were advised that (i) ADB will reject a proposal of award if it determines that a bidder has\nengaged in corrupt or fraudulent practices when competing for the contract in question; (ii) any\nexpenditure incurred with or through corrupt or fraudulent practices will not be reimbursable;\n(iii) any firm or individual found to have engaged in such practices will be declared ineligible for\nADB-financed contracts, either indefinitely or for a stated period; and (iv) where such practices\nhave been engaged in and the Government has not taken timely and appropriate remedial\naction, the relevant portions of the loan may be canceled.\n6.  Project Reviews\n124. In addition to semiannual reviews, a comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken\nby the Government and ADB at about the end of the second year of project implementation to\nassess the project\u2019s progress and achievements against its objectives; to identify any difficulties\nbeing encountered; and recommend remedial action, if and where required.\n7.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n125. The PMU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and provide them to\nADB within 30 days after the end of the applicable period. The reports will be provided in the\n                  \n38 According the specific packages of consulting services, domestic consultants will be recruited both under separate\ncontracts and under the same contracts as international consultants.", "30\nformat of ADB\u2019s project performance report and will include progress made against established\ntargets and problems encountered during the period under review, steps taken and proposed to\nbe taken to resolve the problems, compliance with loan covenants, and the work program\nproposed to be undertaken during the succeeding quarter. Brief monthly reports by facsimile or\nelectronic mail are also recommended to enhance proactive project management. The PMU will\nmonitor the progress of implementation. Within three months after the physical completion of the\nproject,  MSWL  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  providing  details  on\nimplementation, accomplishments, benefits, and evaluation.\n126. Separate records and accounts for all expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of\nthe loans will be maintained by MSWL in accordance with sound accounting principles. The\nsub-PMU at MECS will also maintain separate reports and accounts for NDF-financed activities\nunder the employment promotion and improvement of working conditions component. They will\nspecify the expenditures for all activities and identify all expenditures to be financed out of the\nloan proceeds. Project accounts, including financial statements, statements of expenditures,\nand imprest account records, will be audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The\nauditors\u2019 report, and copies of the certified accounts and related financial statements, including\nthe auditors\u2019 opinions on the use of loan proceeds, compliance with loan covenants, and the use\nof the imprest account under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures, will be submitted to\nADB in English not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n8.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n127. MSWL will modify the existing management information system for the social security\nsystem to allow clear and ongoing impact assessment of project activities without establishing\nduplicate  reporting  structures.  This  will  include  quantitative  and  qualitative  data  on  social\nwelfare,  social  insurance,  and  employment  promotion  services  and  will  include  indicators\nspecified in the SSSDP framework (Appendix 1). Efficiency of service provision will also be\nmeasured under this system. The project will support achievement of the required modifications.\nMSWL  will  develop  additional  indicators  for  the  system  and  the  finalized  system  will  be\nsubmitted to ADB for concurrence within three months after loan effectiveness.\nVI. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n128. The SSSDP will be accompanied by advisory TA to support the Government\u2019s efforts to\nstrengthen  social  security  reform.  Specifically,  the  TA  for  Strengthening  Policy  for  Social\nSecurity Reform will help develop a long-term vision and strategic framework and action plans\nfor social security development in the country. The TA will build the activities started during the\nproject preparatory TA and assist Government officials in carrying out a full review of the\ncountry\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats with respect to the social security\nsector.  Existing  legislation,  policies,  and  programs  will  be  reviewed  and  proposals  for\nimprovement  enshrined  in  a  social  security  master  plan,  which  will  developed  with  full\nparticipation of key stakeholders and bilateral and multilateral agencies. MSWL will be the\nExecuting Agency for the TA. The TA is estimated to cost $720,000 equivalent, comprising\n$450,000 in foreign exchange and $270,000 equivalent in local currency cost. Of these costs,\nADB will provide $600,000 equivalent on a grant basis, from the ADB-funded TA program to\nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and $150,000 equivalent of the local currency cost.\nThe TA is described in Appendix 16.", "31\nVII. BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Expected Impacts\n1.  Benefits\n129. The main benefit of the SSSDP will be to reduce poverty and increase security of\nvulnerable  groups  by  creating  a  sustainable  social  security  system  that  is  (i)  capable  of\ndelivering adequate essential services to the poor, and (ii) cost effective and efficient. The\nproject will improve quality and coverage of social assistance benefits and welfare services,\nemployment services, and social insurance, which will directly benefit poor and vulnerable\ngroups dependent on social services. Principal beneficiaries of the reformed social security\nsystem  will  include  870,000  people,  72  percent  living  below  the  poverty  line.  The  direct\nbeneficiaries of the investment components of the project are 20,000 very poor, including most\nvulnerable children, elderly and PWD: all groups that have disproportionately borne the brunt of\nthe difficult transition period.\n130. Developing management information systems in social welfare agencies and EROs at\nprovincial and district levels, will contribute to more effectively monitoring mechanisms of the\nimpact of different social welfare and employment services, and thus allow for more effective\nand equitable use of social welfare resources and improved employment conditions.\n131. The focus on fostering private sector participation in providing social security services\nover the medium to long term is expected to mobilize resources to supplement public budgetary\nexpenditure and provide users with a greater choice of services. Improved targeting will mean a\nmore  efficient  use  of  resources  and  institutional  and  organizational  reforms  will  result  in\nsignificant recurrent cost savings.\n132. The development of a comprehensive master plan will benefit the social security sector\nby providing a formal framework for medium- and long-term policy and planning. This will permit\na shift from short-term, uncoordinated interventions to a more effective system better able to\naddress poverty reduction on a sustainable basis.\n2.  Impact on Poverty\n133. The SSSDP addresses key areas of reform in social protection and labor markets. The\npolicy conditions of the SSSDP are pro-poor and contribute to overall poverty reduction by\npromoting human resource development, improved governance, and pro-poor growth through\nallowing the poor to compete better in challenging labor markets. Policy reforms related to\nimproving  the  quality  and  coverage  of  social  welfare  benefits  and  allowances  will  have  a\nsubstantial impact on the welfare of the poor by increasing the proportion of poor who are\ncovered by the system.\n134. Up to 230,000 people are expected to benefit from the social assistance and welfare\npolicy services component of whom 160,000 currently live below the poverty line. The main\nbeneficiaries are the most vulnerable among the elderly, PWD, pregnant and nursing mothers,\nmothers with many dependent children and single-headed households.\n135. Policy  reforms  related  to  the  labor  market  and  skills  training  will  enable  access  to\nadvisory and counseling services offered by EROs and quality employment-oriented education\nand training to increased numbers of the unemployed who currently have no such opportunities.", "32\nThe availability of such programs will be enhanced by enabling private sector participation in the\ndelivery of education and training programs. Up to 260,000 unemployed people, of whom\n143,000 live below the poverty line, are likely to benefit from expanded access to employment\nservices.\n136. Improving  SSIGO\u2019s  ability  to  enforce  compliance  of  social  insurance  payments  will\nincrease levels of security for workers close to the poverty line by ensuring that they receive\nbenefit payments in the case of unemployment or occupational injuries or diseases. Clearing up\nthe sizable arrears of state budget organizations will reduce delays in providing social insurance\nbenefits, a major source of income for poor households. About 330,000 people will benefit from\nthis intervention, including 285,000 who live below the poverty line.\n137. The investment project is directly targeting the extreme poor and vulnerable groups.\nSocial welfare service facilities will be improved, targeting, among others, PWD and elderly. To\ntarget the extreme poor, community-based projects will be established to improve the quality of\nlife, protect the poorest of the poor, and raise levels of human development in selected areas.\nAbout 10,000 poor people will directly benefit from these activities. Additionally, 9,750 very poor\nunemployed (of whom females are disproportionately represented) will be trained to increase\ntheir income opportunities under the investment component.\nB. Risks and Safeguards\n138. Political  Risks.  Although  the  Government  changed  frequently  in  the  late  1990s,\ndelaying the processing of the SSSDP, the current Government is stable and the SSSDP\u2019s\nimplementation is not likely to be disrupted. Implementation of reforms, which will change\ncriteria for entitlement to social welfare benefits, could prove controversial and may encounter\nresistance. Consequently, effective support measures, especially for employment promotion,\nneed to be provided for people whose entitlement is removed. At the same time, the quality of\nsocial welfare services must be improved to convince the public of the need for such reforms.\nReforms in social insurance must also be handled carefully to prevent loss of confidence in the\nsystem. To mitigate these risks, the principal safeguard will be ensuring maximum popular\nparticipation in designing and implementing the measures. To achieve this, the local parliaments\nmust have a role in the change, and public education campaigns should be well used to gain\nsupport for policy reforms.\n139. Institutional Risks. A potential risk to effective implementation is the lack of institutional\ncapacity  for  undertaking  and  sustaining  wide-ranging  reforms,  given  the  severe  budgetary\nconstraints that have led to shortages of qualified personnel. Capacity building, with focus on\nupgrading of skills and knowledge of key staff, will, therefore, be crucial to the success of the\nSSSDP. Foreign and local training should be offered at postgraduate levels to ensure that\nMongolian specialists have access to the latest and most comprehensive learning resources.\nThis will also serve as a major incentive to staff to remain in public service.\n140. In  addition,  the  implementation  of  the  SSSDP  requires  close  coordination  between\nseveral  central-  and  regional-level  government  agencies.  Costs  of  communication,  staff\nshortages, and imperfect coordination procedures generally render this difficult. Furthermore,\nkey  agencies  have  little  experience  with  international  project  management,  including\nmanagement of efficient procurement and disbursement processes. While capacity-building\nmeasures should be in place to develop these competencies, a dedicated project management\nstructure should be established for the lifetime of the SSSDP to ensure achievement of its\nobjectives.", "33\n141. Economic Risks. One of the key objectives of the SSSDP is to reduce unemployment.\nAs, however, the responsibility now for creation of new jobs lies primarily in the private sector,\nthe overall enabling environment, and especially the macroeconomic situation, will determine\ntheir ability to provide employment. Thus, the SSSDP will need to coordinate fully with other\ninterventions designed to promote macroeconomic stability and engender economic growth in\nMongolia.\n142. Other Risks. The Government\u2019s formal social security system is an important element of\na comprehensive social security system but not the only one. The design and implementation of\nthe  social  security  system  must  be  coordinated  with  strategies  aimed  at  addressing  other\ndimensions of vulnerability for the Mongolian people.\nVIII. ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n143. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Within six months after the loans become effective, MSWL will develop indicators\nfor modification of the standard monitoring and evaluation subsystem, and submit\nthe specifications of the modified system for ADB\u2019s concurrence.\n(ii)  Within  18  months  after  the  loans  become  effective  the  Government  will\ncommence  training,  retraining,  and  skills  upgrading  programs  for  the\nunemployed, in accordance with a plan acceptable to ADB.\n(iii)  Within  18  months  after  the  loans  become  effective,  the  Government  will\ncommence implementing a program for facilitating access of beneficiaries to\nongoing  and  planned  microfinance  schemes,  in  accordance  with  a  plan\nacceptable to ADB.\n(iv)  The first three applications slated for approval by the community social welfare\ninnovation  will be reviewed jointly with ADB before final approval.\n(v)  The Borrower will ensure that the investment project is carried out, and all project\nfacilities are constructed, operated, maintained, and monitored in accordance\nwith the existing laws, regulations, and standards of the Borrower concerning\nenvironmental protection, and with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines.\nB.  Conditions for Loan Negotiations\n144. Prior to negotiations the Government:\n(i) established the steering committee for the SSSDP, acceptable to ADB;", "34\n(ii) presented for approval by the Parliament, a new law on employment, which\nincludes a definition of the role of training for employment in active labor market\npolicy;\n(iii) established  a  broad-based  working  group  to  evaluate  the  efficiency  and\neffectiveness of social assistance benefit systems in reaching the poor and very\npoor, and assessed the current impact of benefits on poverty reduction;\n(iv) established  a  broad-based  working  group  to  evaluate  the  efficiency  and\neffectiveness of existing social work systems for supporting the poor and very\npoor, and assessed the quality of programs for training and preparing social\nworkers;\n(v) established  a  broad-based  working  group  to  assess  levels  of  coverage  of\nemployment services to the de facto unemployed, and assessed the impact of\nexternal and domestic programs in support of employment services; and\n(vi) had MSWL commence recruitment of the project manager and key staff of the\nPMU and sub-PMU, subject to ADB\u2019s concurrence.\nC.  Conditions for Loan Effectivenes\n145. The Loan Agreement for the investment Project will not become effective until\n(i) MSWL has appointed the project director and key staff of the PMU and sub-\nPMU,  with ADB\u2019s concurrence;\n(ii) conditions for effectiveness of the NDF loan for cofinancing the SSSDP are \nfulfilled.\nD. Conditions for Disbursement\n146. Before any disbursement is made for the community social welfare innovation facility,\nMSWL will have (i) established the technical committee in accordance with terms of reference\nand membership criteria acceptable to ADB; (ii) finalized, with ADB\u2019s concurrence, the criteria\nand procedures for screening and selecting innovations in community social welfare service\nprovision; and (iii) finalized, with ADB\u2019s concurrence, procedures for availing of the development\nfacility.\nIX. RECOMMENDATION\n147. I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve:\n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 6,378,000 to\nMongolia for the Social Security Sector Development Program, with a term of 24\nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate\nof 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in", "35\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Program Loan Agreement presented\nto the Board;

Under the command economy before 1990, the social sectors in Mongolia received high\nlevels  of  investment  and  fiscal  support.  Access  to  employment  was  nearly  universally\nguaranteed and there was no recognized unemployment. Health and education services were\nwidespread and accessible because of the high priority the Government placed on human\ndevelopment. The social security system was based on a combination of consumer subsidies,\nuniversal benefits transferred from the central budget, and state sector wages. All sectors of\nsociety were covered by the pension systems and the state also provided a comprehensive\nrange of social protection benefits to families, children, and groups designated as \u201cvulnerable.\u201d\nAbout 40 percent of government expenditures were devoted to social development.a\n2. Following transition, the Government made steps to change the social welfare  system\nfrom provision of universal access to targeted interventions. Additionally, expenditures allocated\nto social security remained relatively high, 16.5 percent of total public expenditures in 1998.\nDespite these efforts the present social welfare system, which covers retirement, disability and\nsurvivor pensions, work injury, unemployment, maternity benefits, health, a social insurance\nsystem, and a national poverty alleviation program have had limited impact on poverty.\nA.       Poverty and Social Characteristics\n3. The incidence of poverty in Mongolia is high; about 36 percent of the population live\nbelow the poverty line and about 20 percent live in extreme poverty.b The last official estimate of\npoverty showed that poverty was disproportionately urban, with 57.2 percent of the poor resided\nin urban areas and 42.8 percent residing in rural areas. However the weather-induced shock of\nthe severe storms in the winters of 1999 \u2013 2000 and 2000-2001 and the intervening drought in\nthe summer of 2000 has had a deleterious impact on the rural population.\n4. Growth in income poverty since 1990 has been accompanied by a concomitant decline\nin the ability to enjoy basic capabilities. Problems of malnutrition among children under five have\nraised concerns about food security. Previous achievements in education have been eroded.\nEnrollment in grades 1 to 8 declined from near universal levels (99 percent) in 1990 to 82\npercent  in  1997.  While  concerted  efforts  by  the  Government  resulted  in  an  increase  in\nenrollment rates to 90 percent, the decline in the intervening years however, has produced a\nlarge number of children whose capacities in the long term have been impaired by the years of\nlost education.\n5. The official rate of unemployment is 6.5 percentc (39,000 people) but actual levels are\nundeniably higher. Actual unemployment (after adjusting for those employed outside the formal\nsector) ranges from 17 to 23 percent of the population. The provinces in particular have suffered\nfrom massive layoffs of workers by private firms and the public service. Also, the incidence of\nyoung people unable to work is increasing with severe social and economic consequences.\nLoss of employment is the most prevalent trigger of impoverishment in Mongolia.d Nearly 58\npercent of all unemployed are poor.\n                  \na  Mongolia, A Poverty Reduction Strategy for ADB Operations in Mongolia, May 2000.\nb  From the 1998 Living Standard and Measurement Survey, (LSMS). The LSMS is based on an expenditure-based\npoverty line for an intake of 2,100 Kilocalorie., which is comparable with the norm in other developing countries.\nc  The official definition considers the unemployed to be the number of people who have registered with the labor\nregistry as unemployed. This excludes first time labor market entrants ineligible for labor registry services and\nthose who perceive no value in registering. Hidden unemployment is estimated at 12 percent (footnote 1).\nd  Participatory Living Standards Assessment, Draft, 2000", "Appendix 5, page 2\n53\n6.  The existing social security system has proved inadequate dealing with poverty. Social\ninsurance and social assistance do not guarantee recipients freedom from poverty as minimum\nand average pension rates are very low, and access to unemployment benefits is limited for\ngroups  such  as  small-scale  herders  and  informal  sector  workers.  Only  9,000  individuals\nreceived unemployment benefits from the social insurance system in 2000. The unemployment\ninsurance system is performing virtually no role in reducing poverty because the eligibility\ncriteria for payment exclude are too strict in relation to the mainly young unemployed population.\nNor is the system assisting in employment generation, as few beneficiaries take advantage of\nthe small training grant to which they are entitled.\n7. Addressing the structural nature of poverty in Mongolia, the social security system,\nincluding employment generation, should be the main program for assisting the poor.e Studies\non sources of livelihood in Ulaanbaatar, provincial centers, and district Centers indicate that the\npoor and the very poor in particular rely significantly on pension and allowances,f indicating the\nimportance of strengthening these schemes to improve the economic and social security for\npoor and vulnerable groups.\n8. The social welfare system will need considerable restructuring to reduce the cost of\nservices delivered and to streamline social welfare beneficiary rolls (some categories such as\nwar  veterans  have  tripled  in  size  over  a  three-year  period).  Significant  new  investment  is\nneeded as there has been little investment in the last 10 years and the legacy infrastructure of\nthe Soviet era is expensive to operate. The level of services has deteriorated due to decaying\ninfrastructure-heating and electricity are examples. Deterioration is also apparent in health and\neducation services and the number and quality of facilities and homes for those with physical\nand mental disabilities have been reduced. Families are finding it harder to take care of their\nmore vulnerable members in the difficult economic circumstances and the traditional social\nnetworks of assistance are gradually breaking down. Finally, some of the subsidies provided are\nenjoyed more by nonpoor than poor.\nB. Social Dimensions\n1.  Vulnerable Groups\n9. The  Government  has  identified  orphans,  people  with  disabilities  (PWD),  single\nhousehold pensioners, female-headed households, households with more than four children,\nthe unemployed, and small herders in remote areas to be particularly vulnerable to poverty. The\ngroups identified as the poorest and vulnerable include those who work outside the formal\nsector and hence find themselves ineligible for the formal safety net.\n10. The most important safety net for very poor and vulnerable groups in Mongolia remains\nthe informal safety nets through extended kinship networks, usually from younger to older\nmembers of the family. This is particularly strong in rural areas, but has increased in urban\nareas as a result of the dramatic rural-to-urban migration that has been taking place during the\ntransition. Kinship networks are likely weaker than before but still play an important role in\n                  \ne  The Poverty Partnership Agreement between the Government and Asian Development Bank (ADB) has identified\nunemployment as one of the leading causes of poverty\nf  In Ulaanbaatar, 56 percent of the poor and 100 percent of the very poor rely on pension and allowances. The same\nfigure is 46 percent and 89 percent in provincial center, and 50 percent and 61 percent in district centers.\nParticipatory Living Standards Assessment, Draft, 2000.", "54\nAppendix 5, page 3\ncoping strategies for households. The growing inequality has modified the nature of kinship\nnetworks, often turning them into patron-client relations, as poorer relatives offer their labor to\nthe wealthier kin in exchange for food and other services.\n2.  Gender\n11. During the transition to a new market economy, the economic and social independence\nof the female half of the population has been severely undermined. Reduction in health and/or\nsocial services results in women having to spend more time caring for the young, sick, and/or\nelderly.\n12. Women account for 52.2 percent of the unemployed.g Women were the first to be laid off\nupon closure or restructuring of processing, and trade industries that traditionally hired many\nwomen. After disintegration of Government-owned agricultural farms and privatization of their\nlivestock and machinery, more than 20,000 trained women lost their jobs.h Only 39.7 percent of\nwomen receive any social benefits as compared to 60.4 percent of men.\n13.  According to the Law on Pensions and Benefits from the Social Insurance Fund (1995),\nmany women aged 36-55 who had 4 or more children are pushed into retirement. Because of\nthis law, women\u2019s right to work, and choose their jobs is limited. Additionally, women aged 55\nwho contributed to the Pension Fund for not less than 20 years can receive pension if they\ndesire so; men must be 60. This forces women into earlier retirement than men.\n14. Specific attention needs to be paid to women\u2019s unique problems and life patterns when\nconsidering social welfare services and benefits, labor market policies, and strengthening of the\nsocial insurance system. Labor market interventions must go beyond a purely traditional agenda\nto adequately address special concerns of women, such as a higher incidence of homework,\ncompeting demands from other household responsibilities, and the particular needs surrounding\nchild bearing. Social insurance programs need to be designed to take into account the longer\nlives of women, and the additional implications for women of the risk of loss of support due to\ndeath, of abandonment by or divorce from a spouse, and the less stable earning patterns found\namong women.\n3.  People with Disabilities\n15. A survey conducted by the National Center of Vocational Training and Rehabilitation in\nMarch 2001, showed that Mongolia has 115,000 PWD. Of an estimated 39,700 PWD capable of\nworking, only 5,200 (13.1 percent) are actually employed. The unemployment rate of PWD is\ntherefore, extremely high at 86.9 percent. Combined with the massive deterioration of social\nwelfare and social insurance services for PWD since 1991, poverty rates of PWD show that\nmore than 50 percent live in poverty and more than 60 percent are women.\n16. Although legislation to protect and support PWD is fairly well developed, implementation\nis insufficient due to severe budgetary constraints. In the first three quarters of 2000, 20,085\nPWD received disability pensions from the MWSL. However, the social welfare to which they\nare entitled is frequently insufficient and forces them to rely on relatives and/or charity for\nsupport.\n                  \ng  The National CEDAW Watch Network Center, 2001\nh  Situational Analysis of Women in Mongolia, 2000, Draft.

The Project will improve the quality and coverage of social assistance benefits and\nwelfare services, employment services, and social insurance, which will directly benefit poor and\nvulnerable groups by increasing the proportion of poor that are covered and the amount they\nreceive through improved means testing. Improving the quality and coverage of social welfare\nservices and benefits will sharpen the targeting of benefits to cover a greater proportion of  the\npoor  through  improved  means  testing.  The Project will benefit 870,000 individuals of which\n72.3 percent is living below the poverty line.\n18. Component 1. The beneficiaries of the social assistance and welfare policy services\ncomponent are the currently about 230,000 social welfare beneficiaries receiving short-term\nbenefits, discounts, and in-kind benefits. The main recipients of social assistance benefit and\nwelfare services are the elderly, PWD, pregnant and nursing mothers, mothers with many\ndependent  children,  and  surviving  dependents  of  household  that  have  lost  their  main\nbreadwinner. About 70 percent of the social welfare beneficiaries can be considered income\npoor. Thus, about 160,000 poor people will benefit directly from improving the quality and\ncoverage of social welfare services and benefits.\n19. The investment component will upgrade nursing homes and the National Center for\nRehabilitation of the Disabled. Upgrading of nursing homes will improve access for 1,000 poor\npeople especially PWD and elderly. The support to the National Center for Rehabilitation of the\nDisabled will provide improved service to 1,500 PWD. Three pilot social security centers will\nimprove services to more than 5,000 poor clients. To target the extreme poor, and develop\nmodels for community-based social welfare services, the investment component will initiate 50\ncommunity-based projects supporting up to 4,000 people, including vulnerable groups such as\nPWD, elderly, children, and single-parent families.\n20. Developing community-based social service delivery will lower cost and increase quality\nand  the  utilization  rate  by  the  needy  who  remain  largely  unserved.  At  the  same  time,  a\ncommunity based approach will help keep social welfare clients in their own communities while\ncreating needed income generating opportunities.\n21. Component 2. Employment services focus on upgrading the skills of the labor force\nwhich is key to expansion of the private sector generating sustainable employment creation and\nto enabling Mongolia to compete in an increasingly globalized economy. Policy reform will\nenable access to labor registry services and quality vocational and skills training to the bulk of\nunemployed  who  remain  unserved  and  ensure  that  unemployed  are  equipped  with  skills\nrelevant to the labor market. The availability of skills training resources will be enhanced by\nenabling private sector participation in the delivery of skills training. The increased pool of skilled\nworkers will support expansion of the private sector currently hampered by limited availability of\nskilled workers and promote pro-poor growth. This in turn will generate revenues through taxes\nthat  can  be  used  to  fund  further  investment  in  human  resource  development  and  social\nprotection.\n22. Increased vocational and skills training will be provided to about 260,000 unemployed\npeople.  As  55  percent  of  the  unemployed  are  poor,  the  number  of  poor  beneficiaries  is\nestimated at 143,000, including about 90,000 school graduates and  leavers who are unable to\nfind employment and not eligible for unemployment-related services through the labor registry.", "56\nAppendix 5, page 5\n23.  Component 2 will rehabilitate 25 Employment Training Centers (ETCs) and train 5,000\nunemployed people.  Decentralized Employment Education Centers (EECs)  will  be established\nproviding training opportunities for 4,000 young unemployed.i Business development services\nwill be developed in 10 ETCs, targeting the unemployed and poor in particular; 5,000 people will\nbe trained in business development services. Increasing the provision of vocational training and\nskills training programs to the unemployed and poor will reduce these groups\u2019 risk of/and\nvulnerability to interruption of income due to illness or temporary unemployment.\n24. Component 3. In 1999, social insurances covered 650,000 individuals. Social insurance\ncover pensions, benefits, health, employment injury, and unemployment.  The SSSDP will\nupgrade the management capacity of the Social Insurance General Office (SSIGO), which will\nensure  more  efficient  and  effective  handling  of  social  insurance  services.  Increasing  the\ncoverage to the self-employed and herders will improve security of many vulnerable people, at\nrisk of falling into poverty.\n25. Many retirees and their families depend almost entirely on the income from their social\ninsurance, and most recipients of social insurance would be poor if they did not receive their\npensions. Some proportions of social insurance recipients are poor because their pension may\nbe the only income of the household. About 330,000 beneficiaries will benefit from the social\ninsurance program, and 285,000 of the beneficiaries live below the poverty line.\n26. Indirectly  the  SSSDP  will  benefit  the  poor  by  developing  management  information\nsystems in social welfare agencies and Central Employment Regulation Office at provincial and\ndistrict levels. This will contribute to more effectively monitoring mechanisms of the impact of\ndifferent  social  welfare  and  employment  services,  and  thus  allow  for  more  effective  and\nequitable use of social welfare resources as well as improved employment conditions.\n27.  The development of a comprehensive master plan will benefit the social security sector\nby providing a formal framework for medium-and long-term policy and planning. This will permit\na shift from short-term, uncoordinated interventions to a more effective system better able to\naddress poverty reduction on a sustainable basis.\n28. Estimated number of beneficiaries of SSSDP are detailed in the following table:\nTable A5.1: Investment Project Beneficiaries\nComponents No. of Beneficiaries No. of poor beneficiaries Percentage of poor\nbeneficiaries\nSocial  Assistance  and 230,000 160,000 70\nWelfare Services\nEmployment Services 260,000 143,000 43\nSocial Insurance 330,000 285,000 85\nTotal 820,000 588,000 72\nD. Poverty Impact of Policy Actions under the Program\n29. Improving the Quality and Coverage of Social Welfare Services and Benefits. The\nobjective is to be achieved by (i) rationalizing the system of social assistance, (ii) developing\ncommunity-based  social  welfare  service  delivery  mechanisms;  (iii)  establishing  a  new\nframework for social work services.

The levels of current allowances paid are too low to have a substantial impact on\nthe welfare of the poor while a large proportion of the poor are not covered.  Developing\ncommunity- based social service delivery will lower cost and increase quality  and the utilization\nrate by the needy who remain largely unserved.  At the same time, a community based\napproach will help keep social welfare clients in their own community while creating needed\nincome generating opportunities.  Development of a framework is needed to institute the reforms\ndeveloped under the program.\n30. Developing Pro-Poor Labor Market Policies. The objective is to be achieved by (i)\nincreased provision of vocational and skills training programs to the unemployed and poor, and\n(ii) expanded eligibility for employment services to uninsured and unemployed applicants. The\npurpose of this policy area is to expand the provision of vocational and skills training program in\na manner responsive to the needs of the private sector.  Introducing standards for accreditation,\nimproving supervision, and upgrading training programs and teachers protects the students by\nensuring a relevant and quality education is provided.

These measures will ensure vocational high\nschool skills training students with skills relevant to the labor market. Encouraging private\nsector participation in the delivery of skills training increases level of resources for skills\ntraining.  The increased pool of skilled workers will support expansion of the private sector\ncurrently hampered by limited availability of skilled workers and will thus promote pro-poor\ngrowth. This in turn will generate revenue through taxes that can be used to fund further\ninvestment in human resources development and social protection.\n31. Strengthening  Social  Insurance  to  Increase  Compliance. The  objective  is  to  be\nachieved  by  (i)  improve  institutional  framework  and  organizational  structures  for  Social\nInsurance;  (ii)  clearing  of    arrears  in  contributions  from  state  budget  organizations,  (iii)\nupgrading of the powers of social insurance inspectors to those of tax inspectors, (iv) expanded\nsocial insurance for self-employed and herders.

Improving the\norganization of the State Social Insurance General Office, particularly the information systems,\nand amending the powers of social insurance inspectors helps ensure that workers receive the\nlevel of pension to which they are entitled.  Clearing up the sizable arrears of state budget\norganizations will improve the financial health of SSIGO reducing delays in payment pensions,\na major source of income for poor households.\n31. Developing a Social Security Master Plan. A comprehensive master plan will benefit\nthe social security sector greatly by providing a formal framework for medium-and long-term\npolicy and planning.  This will lead to improvements in services to social welfare recipients,\nsocial insurance beneficiaries, and recipients of employment services. This will permit the shift\nfrom short-term, uncoordinated interventions to a more effective system better able to address\npoverty reduction on a sustainable basis.

Rationale.  At  present,  Mongolia  relies  on  an  inherited  system  of  institutional  social\nwelfare services for vulnerable groups. The system is not cost effective, is against traditional\nMongolian regard for the family, and (most important) is not the best way to deal with members of\nvulnerable groups in need of assistance. While institutionalization may be required for a limited\nnumber of people, community-based approaches to social welfare services will address the\nabove  issues.  Although  such  approaches  have  been  implemented  in  Mongolia  in  a  limited\nmanner they are comparatively new. They also require adapting to the specific situation in\nMongolia today and people will need time to adjust to them. They will also require cooperation\nbetween local government and civil society organizations. To gain greater understanding of the\npossible interventions suitable to Mongolia, to demonstrate the effectiveness of such approaches,\nand  to  support  the  development  of  a  national  strategy  for  community-based  social  service\ndelivery, a development facility for innovations in this area will be incorporated into the project.\n2. Objective. This facility is intended to support community-based social welfare service\ninterventions on a pilot basis. It will address issues related to vulnerable groups, including, (i) the\nelderly, (ii) people with disabilities (PWD) (iii) children, and  (iv) single-parent families.\n3. Nature of the Facility. Funding will be provided for implementing innovative approaches\nto community-based interventions for social welfare services. Proposals will be reviewed and\napproved by a technical committee appointed by the minister of the Ministry of Social Welfare and\nLabor (MSWL) and chaired by the director of MSWL\u2019s Policy Coordination Department. 1 Awards\nwill be in the form of block grants not normally in excess of $10,000 equivalent; the exact amount\nand phasing of disbursements will depend on the proposal. The amount of each block grant may\nvary, and will be determined by the technical committee.\n4. Criteria for Evaluation and Award. Evaluation criteria for the proposals will include\ntechnical  soundness  of  the  proposed  innovation,  relevance  to  priority,  development  and\nimplementation  costs,  beneficiary  coverage  and  needs,  potential  for  replication,  and\nsustainability. Special consideration will be given to proponents who can provide counterpart\nsupport or mobilize community or local government support. The State Social Welfare Agency\n(SSWA) and Policy Coordination Department of the MSWL in consultation with the technical\ncommittee  will  be  responsible  for  developing  and  submitting  the  detailed  criteria  for  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) concurrence, also as a condition of disbursement.\n5. Eligible  Participants.  The  facility  may  be  availed  of  by  local  government  agencies,\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), groups or individuals. Government agencies may also\navail of the facility for contracting services out to private sector social security service providers.\n6. Implementation Arrangements. The funds for the facility will be disbursed according to\nguidelines  and  procedures  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  funds  will  be\nadministered by the project management unit (PMU) under the guidance of SSWA and MSWL\u2019s\nPolicy Coordination Department. Block grants will be disbursed in a phased manner according to\nmonitorable milestones or indicators that must be elaborated in the proposal. The PMU will\nconduct training workshops for all eligible participants about the availability and operating policies\nand guidelines of the fund. Proposals will be reviewed and approved quarterly.

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n1. The TA is designed to address the shortcomings in social security services in Mongolia\nwhich arise from the absence of any comprehensive policy and planning framework for medium\nand long-term reform and development and for coordination of internal and external resources for\nthe sector. With a lack of any such comprehensive approach at present the sector suffers from\nmajor inefficiencies caused by short-term, ad hoc and often uncoordinated planning processes.\n2. The TA is also designed to address the urgent need to mobilize additional resources for\nsocial security. Reflecting their communist origins in Mongolia, social security services remain\nvery much the preserve of the Government, with relatively little participation of civil society or the\nprivate sector. In addition, the lack of effective coordination of donor activities means that this\nassistance does not always yield optimal results.\n3. There is, therefore, an urgent need for a sector-wide framework for policy and strategy \u2013\nwhich has broad popular support - to better guide programs of support and to ensure that they\nare in accordance with domestic legislation, policies and priorities.\nB. Objectives\n4. The TA for Strengthening Policy for Social Security Reform will assist the government in\nthe development of a comprehensive Social Security Sector Master Plan comprising policies and\nstrategies  designed  to  establish  an  efficient  social  security  sector  appropriate  to  a  market-\noriented economy. The TA will help the Government, and the Ministry of Social Welfare and\nLabor (MSWL) in particular, develop a comprehensive framework for the medium and long-term\ndevelopment  of  the  social  security  sector.  It  will  also  render  support  for  mobilization  and\ncoordination of both internal and external resources for financing of the social security sector.\nC.  Scope\n5. The TA has four components:\n(i)  Development of legislative and policy frameworks for the social security sector, including\nclarification of the role of MSWL and other stakeholders in the sector (attention will be\npaid to (a) MSWL\u2019s role policy and strategy and for ensuring standards, and (b) promoting\npublic-private sector partnerships for service delivery);\n(ii)  Support  for  institutional  organization  of  the  sector  including  reforms  to  MSWL,  its\nregulatory and implementing agencies, and other organizations within its structure or\nreporting to MSWL.\n(iii)  Development of an overall social security sector strategy (the Master Plan) for 10 years as\nwell as the first rolling three-year plans of action for implementing it.\n(iv)  Development of the following strategies and mechanisms that will feed into the overall\nSocial Security Sector Master Plan (i) social assistance benefit delivery and eligibility (ii)\ncommunity-based social service delivery (iii) community-based social worker system.", "87\n         Appendix 16, page 2\nD.  Consultant Requirements\n6. The TA will provide a total of 47 person-months of consulting services.
