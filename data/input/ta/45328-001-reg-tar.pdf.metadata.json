INTRODUCTION \n1.  Improving development effectiveness and engagement in fragile and conflict-affected \nsituations (FCASs) is an increasingly important challenge for development partners. This reality \nis  acknowledged  and  supported  by  (i) the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment (OECD) in its Fragile States Principles; (ii) donors committed to the 2008 Accra \nAgenda for Action; and (iii) the World Bank in its 2011 World Development Report.1 Participants \nin the International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding (the Dialogue), including the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), endorsed the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States (the \nNew Deal) at the 4th High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in November-December 2011 \nin Busan, Republic of Korea.2 ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 provides an even stronger endorsement.3 \nMoreover, in 2007, ADB adopted a framework for  planning, implementing, and guiding its \napproach to dealing with FCASs, including a methodology for identifying such situations.4 The \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the  continued  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s \napproach, and is aimed at helping ADB\u2019s FCAS developing member countries (DMCs) build \neffective  institutions  that  will  support  their  peace-building  and  state-building  efforts.  It \ncomplements an ongoing TA supporting ADB\u2019s engagement in fragile situations.5 The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  There is broad consensus on the need to work differently in FCASs, as the approaches \ngenerally used in DMCs are not effective in fragile states. Understanding state fragility was a \nkey  concern  raised  during  the  4th  High-Level  Forum  on  Aid  Effectiveness.  The  Busan \nPartnership for Effective Development Co-operation, which was signed at the end of the forum, \nemphasized the need to arrive at a collective understanding of the unique challenges facing \nfragile  states,  overcome  these  challenges,  and  promote  a  solid  foundation  for  lasting \ndevelopment.7 The OECD has developed principles to guide good international engagement in \nFCASs (footnote 1). However, much work needs to be done to understand better the local \ncontext and specific complexities of fragility in each country and to develop more effective \nmechanisms for engagement and support.  \n \n3.  Those who participated in the Dialogue and endorsed the New Deal point out that  \n \n                                                \n1 OECD. 2007.

A New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States.  \n3 Strategy 2020 emphasizes that ADB should employ innovative means to strengthen effectiveness of country-led \nmodels of engagement, sustain commitments for longer periods, align development assistance with other funding \nagencies at strategic and project levels, and pursue deeper, more flexible, and longer engagement in capacity \nenhancement and institutional development.

DMCs ranked in the fourth or fifth quintile on \ncountry performance assessments (CPAs) in 2 of the most recent 3 years, or deemed to be in conflict or \npost-conflict situations, are considered FCAS DMCs. ADB\u2019s approach covers fragile and conflict-affected situations \n(including those that affect only part of a country), sensitive post-conflict transitions, and peace-building situations.  \n5  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Supporting ADB's Engagement in Fragile Situations. Manila (TA 7269-REG). \n6 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 January 2012. \n7 4th High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness. 2011. Busan Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation. \nSigned at the close of the forum, held in Busan, Republic of Korea, from 29 November to 1 December 2011.  \n ", "2 \n \n\u2015international partners can often bypass national interests and actors, providing aid in \noverly technocratic ways that underestimate the importance of harmonizing with the \nnational and local context, and support short-term results at the expense of medium- to \nlong-term  sustainable  results  brought  about  by  building  capacity  and  systems.\u2016 \n(footnote 2) \n \nThe Dialogue is therefore committed to undertaking the necessary actions and reforms, in the \nbelief that a new development architecture and new ways of working, better tailored to the \nsituations and challenges of fragile contexts, are needed to build stable states and societies.  \n \n4.  In 2010, 10 Asian Development Fund countries were identified as FCAS DMCs.8 Five of \nthese\u2014Afghanistan,  Nepal,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Solomon  Islands,  and  Timor-Leste\u2014are \nmembers of the g7+ group that endorsed the New Deal along with development partners and \ninternational organizations.9 Nepal is now in transition and no longer considered a FCAS DMC, \nand the New Deal is being implemented on a pilot scale in conflict-affected Afghanistan and \nTimor-Leste. Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste (i) are small, isolated \nmarkets with limited natural resources and infrastructure; (ii) are weak in policy formulation \nbecause of underdeveloped political and social systems; (iii) have weak social, political, and \nsecurity systems, which are adversely affecting the delivery of essential services; and (iv) are \nhighly vulnerable to climate change and at risk from natural disasters.10 These three DMCs are \nall in the Pacific, where most of ADB\u2019s current FCAS DMCs are located. \n \n5.  Country-led assessments of the causes and features of fragility and sources of resilience \nprovide a better understanding of the local context and a firm basis for the countries to build \nleadership, ownership, and progress out of fragility. In Sri Lanka, where there is subnational \nfragility, a conflict risk assessment was undertaken for all ADB-assisted projects in conflict-\naffected areas. In both Nepal and Sri Lanka, successful conflict-sensitive approaches aimed at \nidentifying conflict risks and peace-building opportunities yielded preliminary tools that were \nused to improve project design and implementation. Such approaches must be sustained and \nstrengthened to address current gaps in development assistance. In particular there is a need \nfor all stakeholders\u2014governments, development partners, civil society, beneficiaries, and the \nprivate  sector\u2014to  participate  effectively  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  development \ninterventions. Their ownership is critical to achieving development outcomes in fragile situations. \n \n6.  The earlier TA (footnote 5) laid the foundation for working differently in FCAS DMCs, to \nassist  in  long-term  capacity  building  in  these  fragile  states. The TA  included  pilot  fragility \nassessments  of  urban  settlements  in  the  Pacific  using  a  community-based  approach  and \nfocusing on the impact of fragility on the delivery of basic services. The expected outcome was \nan improved model for integrated service delivery to informal settlements in fragile states.  \n \n7.  Lessons  from  the  earlier  TA  include  implementation  of  a  peace  filter  supporting  a \nconflict-sensitive approach in Nepal; a political economy analysis supporting implementation of \nthe CPS in Papua New Guinea; and fragility assessments piloted in the Pacific. These will be \ntaken into consideration in designing country-led capacity development plans, and also following \nthe recommendation of the special evaluation study on FCAS to develop a step-by-step plan for \n                                                \n8 Eight of the 10 FCAS DMCs are fragile and are in the Pacific: Kiribati, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the     \nFederated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. The two other \nFCAS DMCs\u2014Afghanistan and Timor-Leste\u2014are conflict affected.  \n9  The g7+ brings together 19 of the world\u2019s most fragile states.  \n10  ADB. 2009.

Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be improved effectiveness of development assistance in FCAS DMCs. \nThe use of differentiated and better implemented country-led models of engagement will support \ncountry-owned transitions out of fragility. The TA will contribute to improved alignment with DMC \ngovernments\u2019  national  development  plans  and  state-building  activities,  as  well  as  stronger \nharmonization with other development partners in the FCAS DMCs in support of country-led \nefforts to move out of their present state of fragility.  \n \n9.    The outcome will be the enhanced capacity of key government agencies in FCAS DMCs \nto address fragility issues. The TA will help develop in government counterparts a keener \nawareness and a stronger capacity to apply appropriate elements of the approach to engaging \nwith FCASs, and thereby build more effective institutions. The TA is expected to promote \nunderstanding of the local context and the nature of fragility in FCAS DMCs. A more targeted \nand effective response to fragility can thus be made through stronger national development \nplans and country partnership strategies, and country-led programs and projects in FCAS can \nbe better designed to advance peace-building and state-building efforts.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  To support growth and economic development and to build effective institutions in FCAS \nDMCs,  the  TA  will  help  in  identifying  peace-building  and  state-building  opportunities  by \ndeveloping  and  conducting  customized  fragility  assessments  using  inclusive  participatory \napproaches and by formulating specific capacity development plans. The aim is to improve the \nuse of innovative instruments and approaches in FCAS DMCs, including peace and fragility \nfilters, and analyses of the political economy to enable the design and implementation of more \neffective country strategies and projects. Country-led capacity development will be carried out to \nenable  governments  to  formulate  and  implement  strategic  and  operational  approaches  to \naddress the challenges of fragility. \n \n1.  Output 1: Country-Led Fragility Assessment Processes and Tools \nSuccessfully Tested and Documented in Selected Fragile and Conflict-\nAffected Situations  \n \n11.  Output 1 responds to the growing recognition that an improved understanding of the \nlocal context, through sound analysis of the political economy and its influence on reform and \ndevelopment in FCAS DMCs, is a crucial step in designing more effective strategies, programs, \nand projects. It is also critical to providing more appropriate and realistic policy advice. Fragility \nassessments are important implementing elements of the New Deal supporting country-led and \ncountry-owned transitions out of fragility (footnote 2).  \n \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2010.

Output 1 will build on previous work on conflict-sensitive approaches in South Asia \n(Nepal and Sri Lanka) and on the fragility assessments developed and pilot-tested in selected \nPacific DMCs. Working closely with government counterparts and development partners, ADB \nwill develop and further test, refine, and validate innovative fragility assessment tools in selected \nFCASs to address conflict sensitivity and fragility issues. The tools will support peace-building \nand state-building efforts, and reinforce \u2015do-no-harm\u2016 approaches. The tools and assessments \nto be developed and tested will include strategic communication plans, inclusive participatory \nprocesses, and identification of implementation constraints and mitigation measures to facilitate \nprivate  sector  development  and  improved  public  service  delivery.  Joint  conflict  or  fragility \nassessments and joint monitoring will be undertaken with government and nongovernment \norganizations, including key national stakeholders, non-state actors, and development partners. \nCountry-led  fragility  assessments  will  identify  the  causes  and  features  of  fragility  and  the \nsources of resilience, to provide a basis for the recommendation of peace-building and state-\nbuilding priorities at the country level.  \n \n2.  Output 2: Country-Led Capacity Development Plans Implemented in \nSelected Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations \n \n13.  Output 2 will involve building critical capacities for peace building and state building, and \naugmenting  the  capacity  of  government  counterparts  to  formulate  and  implement  different \nstrategic and operational approaches. Country-led capacity development plans, covering all \naspects of fragility and conflict (analysis of the political economy, policy dialogue, institutional \nreform, conflict resolution, peace building), will be designed and implemented in selected FCAS \nDMC institutions to strengthen the appropriate skills mix and operational expertise, and to \nsupport improved service delivery.  \n \n14.  Building on research and dialogue already carried out, the TA will map the political \neconomy in selected Pacific FCAS DMCs. This mapping will be used to help strengthen the \ncapacity of government counterpart staff to undertake and apply political economy analysis in \ntheir work. The TA will also support the design of selected projects through political economy \nanalysis. Where appropriate, support will also be provided for political economy analysis in non-\nPacific FCAS DMCs or for specific sector studies.  \n \n15.  Output 2 will build on country initiatives developed and groundwork undertaken under \nthe earlier TA (footnote 10). These include strengthening the FCAS resource center to enable it \nto  share  and  disseminate  knowledge  and  provide  technical  information  to  development \npractitioners on ADB\u2019s field experiences in conflict and fragility situations. This information will \nfeed into customized capacity development plans as well as provide a foundation for evidence-\nbased advice with particular attention to the quality and effectiveness of capacity assessments \nin FCAS DMCs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000 equivalent (Appendix 2). The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The participating \ngovernments will provide counterpart support in the form of in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from April 2012 to April 2014. ADB will be \nthe executing and implementing agency. The focal point for FCAS, working under the guidance \n ", "5 \nof the FCAS steering committee, will be responsible for overall coordination and supervision.12 \nThe TA will focus on ADB\u2019s FCAS DMCs and countries where there is subnational fragility. \nConcerned  regional  departments  will  prepare  requests  for  TA  support  addressing  specific \nchallenges of conflict and fragility in consultation with relevant agencies in the participating \ncountries and with the assistance of the FCAS focal point.  \n \n18.  The  TA  will  share  and  disseminate  the  lessons  learned  through  technical  reports, \nknowledge products, and a database of operational experiences. Good practices identified \nduring the TA will also be disseminated through the FCAS network and resource center and \nthrough a final TA report.  \n \n19.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n20.  Two international development specialists with expertise in fragile and conflict-affected \nsituations (11 person-months, intermittent) will assist in identifying the need for services and \ndeveloping activities, tools, fragility assessments, and plans for capacity development based on \ncountry context, CPA, and country diagnostics. They will assist in developing and pilot-testing \ncountry-led  fragility  assessments  and  capacity  development  plans.  An  international \ncommunications specialist (3 person-months, intermittent) will provide guidance and support in \nthe development, production, and dissemination of knowledge products dealing fragility and \nconflict.  A  national  research  and  knowledge  management  specialist  (20  person-months, \nintermittent),  based  at  ADB  headquarters,  will  assist  the  focal  point  and  support  the \ndevelopment  specialists.  Up  to  12  national  country  specialists  (up  to  30  person-months, \nintermittent) will support the implementation of pilot initiatives in selected FCAS DMCs. The \nconsultants will be recruited individually by ADB according to its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The focal point will submit TA progress \nreports  together  with  other  reports  to  the  steering  committee.  Terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION   \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nEnhancing ADB\u2019s Engagement in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                \n12 The FCAS steering committee, established in 2007, is chaired by the director general of the Strategy and Policy \nDepartment and composed of ADB's heads of departments (Office of the General Counsel, Central and West Asia \nDepartment, East Asia Department, Pacific Department, Regional and Sustainable Development Department, \nSouth Asia Department, Southeast Asia Department, Central Operations Services Office, and Office of Cofinancing \nOperations).
