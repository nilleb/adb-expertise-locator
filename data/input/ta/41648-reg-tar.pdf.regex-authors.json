The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  committed  to  strengthening  governance, \npromoting  sustainable  private  sector  development,  and  encouraging  effective  financial  and \ncorporate  disclosures  in  its  developing  member  countries  in  accordance  with  international \nstandards and best practices. Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, recognize the importance of \ngood financial governance standards for enhancing their investment enabling climate, measured \nby a rising ratio of stock market capitalization to gross domestic product.1 Rational public and \nprivate investment decisions need accurate and timely disclosure of information relating to the \nfinancial condition of institutions. ADB and the three countries concur that enhancing their \naccounting standards in line with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)2 and their \nauditing standards in line with International Standards of Auditing (ISAs) is necessary to achieve \nimproved standards of financial disclosure and governance. \n  \n2.  ADB approved in 2005 a regional policy and advisory technical assistance grant3 to help \nthree Central Asian republics and Mongolia enhance financial disclosure standards. Specifically, \nthe TA sought to improve accounting standards in the four countries in line with IFRSs and \nauditing standards in line with ISAs. The outputs of the TA were widely appreciated by all four \ncountries as relevant to addressing capacity issues in the implementation of IFRSs and ISAs. \nGiven (i) the basic structural similarity of the former Soviet Union (FSU) countries\u2019 legal and \nregulatory framework for accounting and auditing and (ii) the wide appreciation of the outputs of \nthe TA, the ADB staff assessment is that it could be replicated in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and \nGeorgia  with  suitable  adjustments.  A  recent  ADB  mission  discussed  with  the  relevant \nstakeholders in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia the scope of support needed.   \n \n3.  Drawing on the experience gained and lessons learned from the earlier TA, the present \nTA4 will train accountants, auditors, and regulators to enforce more effectively accounting and \nauditing standards while fostering knowledge sharing in applying IFRSs and ISAs. Adopting an \nintegrated  approach,  the  TA  will  identify  and  address  country-specific  weaknesses  in  the \ninstitutional, legal, and regulatory frameworks of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia affecting the \nadoption of IFRSs and enforcement of ISAs. A regional approach under ADB\u2019s aegis has the \nbenefit of encouraging better interface, debate on the common problems, and the cost-effective \nsharing of experiences. The TA inputs will be used to develop country-specific action plans for \nstrengthening financial disclosure standards in the three countries, allowing them to benefit from \nopportunities afforded by sharing experiences. The regional interface sought under the TA will \ncomplement,  not  substitute  for,  the  country-specific  focus  envisaged,  given  the  differing \nprogress made by the three countries in accounting and auditing reforms. The TA\u2019s design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Enacting  and  enforcing  transparent  financial  disclosure  standards  pose  particular \nchallenges for the three countries, given the nascent state of their regulatory and jurisprudence \n                                                 \n1 At present, the ratio of stock market capitalization to gross domestic product is 0.8% in Armenia, 1.9% in \nAzerbaijan, and 8.9% in Georgia. \n2  International Accounting Standards were classified as IFRS in 2001 by the International Accounting Standards \nBoard of the International Federation of Accountants. \n3  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Enhancing Financial Disclosure Standards in Transitional Economies. Manila \n(TA 6249-REG, approved on 8 August for $500,000, covered Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, and \nUzbekistan). \n4  The TA first appeared in the Business Opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 March 2008. \n ", "2   \nsystems  (Appendix  2).  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  and  Georgia  nevertheless  recognize  the \nimportance  of  sound,  uniform,  and  transparent  financial  disclosure  standards  to  provide \ncomprehensive information about transactions and institutions undertaking them. The three \ncontiguous countries face broadly similar problems in their accounting and auditing arenas \nattributable to their shared history. While their accounting and auditing sector reforms have \nbeen varied and their devolution asymmetrical, all three countries aim to have IFRS-compliant \naccounting and ISA-compliant audit laws.  \n \n5.  Armenia\u2019s accounting and auditing regulatory framework needs revamping for current \nrelevance  (Appendix  2).  The  Republic  of  Armenia\u2019s  Law  on  Accounting,  enacted  in  2000, \nmandates all legal entities to follow Accounting Standards of the Republic of Armenia. These \nare based on 2000 International Accounting Standards (IASs) and have not since been updated, \nthereby  creating  a  standards  gap.  This  gap  could  be  addressed  through  the  adoption  of \nlegislation in line with the European Union\u2019s 8th Directive (EU8D).5 The rule-based (rather than \nprinciple-based)  practical  application  of  the  Armenian  accounting  standards  has  rendered \nlegally  disclosed  corporate  financial  information  perfunctory.  Only  financial  institutions6 are \nlegally required to follow IFRSs by their regulators. This dichotomy renders comparisons of \nfinancial and other companies difficult. A more serious issue is the compliance gap when \nfinancial statements wrongly claim to have followed IFRS, thereby compromising their truth and \nfairness. The Republic of Armenia\u2019s Law on Auditing mandates auditors\u2019 compliance with 2000 \nISAs, which have not been updated. The two laws mandate the Ministry of Finance7 with \nlicensing and supervising auditors and with monitoring corporate compliance with its accounting \nstandards. Capacity constraints both in the Government and in the auditors\u2019 profession make \nthis task difficult. \n \n6.  Azerbaijan has pursued noteworthy accounting and auditing reforms in the recent past \n(Appendix 2). Azerbaijan\u2019s Law on Accounting is moving towards IFRS compliance. Importantly, \nthe law provides for the automatic incorporation of IFRS updates, without the need for fresh \nlegislative approval, on the principle of EU8D, thereby addressing the standards gap. Further, \nthe  law  mandates  the  Ministry  of  Finance  as  the  enforcer  of  accounting  standards  and \nparticularly of companies\u2019 publication of their financial statements and auditors\u2019 opinions on their \nwebsites  and  local  media.  This  measure  supports  efforts  to  address  the  compliance  gap. \nAzerbaijan\u2019s Law an Auditing Service has undergone, and is undergoing, amendments towards \nISA compliance. Importantly, the regulation, licensing, and supervision of the auditing profession \nis mandated by the Law on Auditing Service to the Azerbaijan Chamber of Auditors (AZCOA), a \nself-regulatory  organization  (SRO)  and  an  IFAC  member.  AZCOA  nevertheless  remains \nanswerable to the office of the President of Republic of Azerbaijan in the prudential discharge of \nits mandate. This maintains the right balance of autonomy with accountability for AZCOA. \n  \n7.  More than its neighbors, Georgia needs significant reforms to its accounting and auditing \nregulatory infrastructure (Appendix 2). Georgia\u2019s Law on Accounting, based on 1999 IASs, \nneeds  updating  to  be  effective.  Enforcement  relies  on  the  Parliamentary  Commission  on \nAccounting, whose resource constraints have inhibited it from doing so effectively. Georgia\u2019s \naccounting standards suffer from both the standards gap and the compliance gap. Georgia\u2019s \nLaw on Auditing, enacted in 1995, has since abolished mandatory audits of companies except \n                                                 \n5  The EU8D on Accounting and Auditing Standards was revised on 17 May 2006 and provides for harmonizing \nfinancial reporting standards by accountants and auditors in the European Union in accordance with IFRSs and \nISAs. \n6  Comprising banks, insurance companies, mortgage companies, security trading companies, and pension funds. \n7  The Ministry of Finance and Economy of Armenia was bifurcated in April 2008 into separate ministries of finance \nand economy. Accounting and auditing are the responsibility of the former. \n ", "  3\nfor listed ones and financial institutions. It has also abolished the licensing of auditors. Auditors \nmay be certified either by the Georgia Federation of Professional Accountants and Auditors, an \nSRO with IFAC membership, or by the Audit Council, which is not an IFAC member. The \nformer\u2019s certification criteria is more stringent than the latter\u2019s. This has created a divergence in \nthe quality of certified accountants and auditors. As a result of the factors cited above, company \nfinancial statements and auditors\u2019 reports cannot be relied on for rational investment or credit \ndecisions.  A  new  consolidated  Law  on  Accounting  and  Auditing  was  drafted  in  2007.  Its \nenactment could help address these issues. The efficacy of the new law would depend on \nsubstantial training for Georgia\u2019s accountants and auditors in the application of IFRSs and the \nenforcement of ISAs, which will be facilitated by this TA. \n  \n8.  Some common generic constraints on the adoption of IFRSs and the enforcement of \nISAs  were  observed  in  the  three  countries.  These  are  (i)  inadequate  knowledge  among \nsupervisors, practicing accountants, and auditors of post-2003 IFRS and ISA developments and \nthe IFAC\u2019s professional ethics for lack of textbooks in the regional languages or opportunities for \ncontinuing professional education; (ii) the lack of normative guidelines for practicing accountants, \nauditors, and regulators in interpreting and implementing IFRSs and ISAs; and (iii) conflicts \nbetween the countries\u2019 civil and tax codes and IFRS principles, which impinge on companies\u2019 \napplication of the latter (Appendix 2). \n \n9.  All  three  countries  have  benefited  from  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment technical assistance in this sector (Appendix 2). Azerbaijan also benefited from a \nWorld Bank loan approved in 2008 to strengthen corporate and public sector accountability. \nADB\u2019s interventions in the region thus far have been limited to a TA covering Azerbaijan along \nwith the Central Asian republics.8 \n \n10.  The  present  TA  will  concentrate  on  facilitating  the  implementation  and  regulatory \nenforcement of IFRSs and ISAs in the three countries. In doing so, it will complement and \ncontinue the efforts of ADB and other donors\u2019 interventions (Appendix 2). This TA will help to \naddress gaps in standards, compliance (para. 5), and differences in income recognition and \nasset valuation between IFRS principles and the countries\u2019 tax codes. The outcome will be \nfacilitated by (i) providing methodologies for addressing legal and regulatory impediments to the \napplication  of  ISAs;  (ii)  training  regulators  on  the  updated  IFRSs  and  ISAs;  (iii)  providing \nmethodologies for reconciling income and asset values computed according to IFRS standards \nand by local tax authorities; (iv) providing specific guidelines for interpreting and implementing \nISAs; (v) recommending criteria for entry, such as examinations, and continued membership in \nthe  profession;  (vi)  translating  accounting  and  auditing  textbooks,  ISA  and  IFAC  ethics \nguidelines, and other updated relevant material into the local language; (vii) establishing criteria \nfor domestic audit firms\u2019 audit of publicly listed companies and quality control of audits; and (viii) \nconducting,  after  the  completion  of  country-specific  domestic  training  programs,  a  regional \nseminar that will provide an interface for accountants, auditors, and regulators from the three \ncountries to share their knowledge in applying IFRSs and ISAs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA impact will be to help improve governance in the corporate and financial sectors \nnationally and regionally. The TA outcome will be improved quality of accounting standards in \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia in line with IFRSs and auditing standards in line with ISAs. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Regional Financial Sector Development. Manila (TA 6137-REG). \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The  TA  will  enhance  the  regulators\u2019  capacity  for  setting  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards and carrying out quality control, through both country-specific and regional training for \nregulators. Providing a common forum for participants to discuss and ameliorate their common \ngeneric constraints will foster better knowledge sharing among countries and thereby enhance \nregional cooperation. Drawing on this work, the TA will develop country-specific action plans to \nimprove financial disclosure. Specifically, the TA will undertake the following activities.  \n \n13.  Formulate guidelines for interpreting and implementing ISA. The TA will examine \nthe countries\u2019 audit laws and, where required, provide definitive and normative guidelines for \ninterpreting and implementing ISA-compliant provisions of audit laws. \n  \n14.  Build local ISA-compliant audit capacity. The TA will (i) facilitate the translation and \npublication  of  current  IFRSs,  ISAs,  and  other  relevant  material  (para.  10)  into  regional \nlanguages; (ii) research and analyze local audit firms\u2019 audit capabilities in implementing IFRSs \nand  ISAs;  (iii)  recommend  minimum  qualifications  and  entry  requirements  for  the  auditing \nprofessions in the three countries; and (iv) establish criteria for domestic audit firms\u2019 audit of \npublicly listed companies and quality control of audits. \n \n15.  Train regulators. The TA will train accountants, auditors, and regulators from the three \ncountries in (i) the impartial application of IFRSs and ISAs, (ii) tax reconciliation procedures, and \n(iii) developing ISA-compliant audit interpretation and implementation guidelines. \n \n16.  Conduct a seminar as an interface for country participants. After completing the \nactivities listed in paras. 13\u201315 within each country, the TA will organize a seminar to provide an \ninterface  for  regulators  from  the  three  countries  to  share  knowledge  and  experience  in \nimplementing IFRS and ISA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000 equivalent. It will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe  Investment  Climate  Facilitation  Fund9 under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility,  and  administered  by  ADB.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in \nAppendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will start in April 2009 and be completed by October 2009. ADB will be the \nExecuting Agency for the TA. The Governance, Finance, and Trade Division of the Central and \nWest  Asia  Department  will  administer  and  implement  the  TA  with  support  from  national \nregulators and other stakeholders. The Ministry of Finance of Armenia, Chamber of Auditors of \nAzerbaijan, and Georgia Federation of Professional Accountants and Auditors will be the TA \nimplementing agencies (IAs).  \n \n19.  The TA will require 24 person-months of consulting services between April and October \n2009.  The  international  consultant  will  be  the  team  leader  and  accountant.  The  national \nconsultants will be accountants, one from each country. The four consultants will be assisted by \ncounterpart  staff  from  the  three  countries\u2019  IAs.  The  IAs\u2019  counterpart  staff  will  guide  the \n                                                 \n9  Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "  5\nconsultants\u2019 research, facilitate access to relevant government and other agencies and officials, \nand provide necessary information. The three countries\u2019 IAs will provide the team leader and the \nnational consultants with office space, furniture, and a telephone line during TA implementation. \nAn  international  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  using  quality-  and  cost-based  consultant \nselection10 and the biodata technical proposal method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Selecting a firm for this purpose \nwill facilitate better coordination between the team leader and the three national consultants in \nthe three countries covered. Appendix 4 gives the outline terms of reference for consultants. \nConsultants will procure equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time).11  \n \n20.  The team leader, with the help of the national consultants, will conduct training courses \nfor practicing accountants, auditors, and regulators. The courses will be customized to fit the \nrequirements of each country and are expected to be conducted in September 2009. A regional \nseminar will be conducted in October 2009 after the consultants complete their diagnostic and \nadvisory work and domestic training. Resource speakers will be invited to add knowledge value \nto the regional seminar. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  Enhancing  Financial  Disclosure  Standards  in \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n10  The technical proposal will be given a weight of 80% and the financial proposal a weight of 20% to reflect the \nprimary focus on quality, with some appreciation of cost factors. \n11  Equipment to be purchased includes computers, printers, photocopiers, and an overhead projector. After the \ncompletion of the TA, equipment items will be handed over to the IA of the country where it was used. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \n   \nImpact       \n       \nImproved governance in the  Visible reduction by at least  Annual reports of the  Assumption \ncorporate and financial  50% in financial irregularities,  listed companies and  Governments\u2019 \nsectors of Armenia,  improprieties, and illegalities  their regulators in the  commitment to good \nAzerbaijan, and Georgia  by listed companies in the  three countries  corporate and financial \n  three countries in 2010a  beginning 1 January  governance, \ncompared with a 2008  2010  demonstrated by their \nbaseline    capacity and willingness \nReports by the ministries  to punish impartially acts \nof finance (MOFs) and  of fraudulent, opaque, or \nother statutory  incomprehensive financial \nregulators of stock  disclosure by companies, \nexchanges  accountants, auditors, \n  and regulators \n \nOutcome       \n       \nImproved quality of  100% of listed companies  Annual audited financial  Assumptions \naccounting standards in line  and 50% of all unlisted  statements of listed  Governments\u2019 \nwith International Financial  companies in the three  companies  commitment to the \nReporting Standards (IFRSs)  countries adopt IFRSs and    application of IFRSs and \nand auditing standards in line  comply with ISAs beginning 1  Reports from stock  the enforcement of ISAs \nwith International Standards  January 2010  market and other  by accountants, auditors, \nof Auditing (ISAs) in all three  corporate regulators  and regulators \ncountries.     \n  Reports from MOFs and  Transparency in \n  other regulators and  governments\u2019 corporate \nsupervisors of the  reports and regulators\u2019 \naccounting and auditing  reports \nprofessions in the three   \ncountries  Risks \n  Outward migration has \nCountries\u2019 laws on  left a lack of trained \naccounting to determine  accountants and auditors \nIFRS compliance, and  to apply IFRSs and ISAs \nlaws on auditing to  in the actual practice of \ndetermine ISA  accounting and auditing  \ncompliance   \n  Lack of continued \nBack-to-office reports  regional dialogue among \n(BTORs) of Asian  the three countries\u2019 \nDevelopment Bank  regulators and the \n(ADB) review missions  accounting and auditing \n  professionsb \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  7\nDesign  Performance  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \n   \nOutputs       \n       \n1.

For  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  and  Georgia,  republics  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU) \nselected for this regional policy and advisory technical assistance (TA), adopting International \nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)1 and rigorously enforcing International Standards of \nAuditing (ISAs) present particular challenges, given the nascent stage of the development of \ntheir legal, regulatory, and jurisprudence systems and the different purposes accounting and \nauditing served in the days of central planning. The countries\u2019 original accounting and auditing \nsystems were designed to provide information necessary for operating a centrally planned \neconomy. In this system, state agencies were the only users of accounting information. The \nprime function of accounting was to monitor and control the use of economic resources to meet \nplanned  targets.  There  were  asymmetries  and  fragmentation  in  corporate  information \ndisclosures and access to them that were vestiges of the Soviet era.2 This system of accounting \ndiffered substantially from IFRSs in (i) matching costs to revenues, (ii) valuing assets, (iii) \ncomputing the cost of production, (iv) its preference for legal form over substance as the basis \nfor  presentation,  and  (v)  the  treatment  of  owners\u2019  equity.  Auditing  in  a  centrally  planned \neconomy  was  limited  to  an  inspection  function  where  compliance  with  regulations  took \nprecedence  over  truth  and  fairness.  Since  enterprises  were  wholly  state-owned  and  their \ncreditors  were  also  the  state  or  other  state-owned  enterprises,  the  need  for  independent \nfinancial control and reporting was never appreciated.  \n \n2.  The  three  countries\u2019  former,  inherited  accounting  and  auditing  systems  were \ninappropriate to the needs of a market economy toward which these countries were moving, \nalbeit at varying speeds. Inevitably, the dichotomy created regulatory gray areas, which allowed \nfinancial  irregularities,  improprieties,  and  illegalities  in  the  three  countries\u2019  enterprise  and \nfinancial  sectors.  These  infractions  were  undoubtedly  exacerbated  by  weak  economic \nmanagement, poor governance structures, and weak legal and regulatory frameworks. Lack of \ntransparency in financial disclosure was a serious detriment to investor confidence for the \ncountries in transition. \n \n3.  Another major and congenital constraint on the creation of rigorous auditing standards \nhas been the conflict between some IFRS and ISA principles on one hand and the three \ncountries\u2019 civil and tax codes on the other. In some instances, provisions of these laws have \nimpeded  the  application  of  IFRSs  and  enforcement  of  ISAs,  particularly  in  areas  such  as \ndepreciation accounting, the provision of gratuity and pension liabilities, and the valuation of \nforeign  exchange-denominated  assets  and  liabilities.  The  origins  of  this  conflict  may  be \nattributed to the three countries\u2019 socialist civil law legacy, where provisions of the civil code \noverrode those of other statutes and, in socialist times, were not questioned by the courts. The \ngoals of revenue collection are different from the needs of investors, which IFRSs and ISAs can \nsatisfy. Moreover, as the ministries of finance (MOFs) or the tax committees spun off from them \nare also responsible for revenue collection, they have generally allowed the countries\u2019 tax codes \nto override the provisions of their accountancy and audit laws where revenue collections were \n                                                 \n1  International Accounting Standards were renamed International Financial Reporting Standards in 2001 by the \nInternational Accounting Standards Board of the International Federation of Accountants. \n2  During Soviet times, information was geared towards the needs of the State Statistics Committee, taxation \nauthorities, and enterprises\u2019 pension obligations to their employees, in that order. Such practices continue. \nInformation about corporate directors\u2019 remuneration and their holdings, as well as the identity of owners, is still \ndifficult for a company stakeholder to discern. \n ", "  Appendix 2  11   \naffected. Although differences between financial and tax reporting are common in developed \ncountries, they are new to accountants and tax collectors in the three FSU countries. \n \n4.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  sound  and  rigorous  financial  standards  for  good \ngovernance, efficient financial intermediation, and sustainable growth, the three countries have \ntaken  steps,  at  varying  speeds  and  with  the  help  of  development  partners,  to  adopt \ninternationally accepted accounting and auditing standards, with some donor assistance. \n \n5.  Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia benefited from United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID) technical assistance to improve accounting and auditing systems (paras. \n6, 8, 10, and 20). Azerbaijan will benefit from a World Bank loan in this regard and from its \nparticipation in an earlier ADB TA. While seeking to create a critical mass of accountants with \nbasic knowledge of IFRSs, and of auditors with ISAs, the countries need more assistance in \napplying this knowledge on a practical and functional basis. The following paragraphs describe \nthe progress, issues, and challenges faced by each country. \n \nB.  Armenia \n \n6.  Armenia\u2019s regulatory framework for accounting is the Republic of Armenia\u2019s Law on \nAccounting  (RALOA),  enacted  in  2000.  RALOA  mandates  that  all  legal  entities  follow  the \nAccounting Standards of the Republic of Armenia (ASRAs). ASRAs are based on 1999 and \n2000 IASs. Companies may voluntarily prepare a parallel set of financial statements using \nIFRSs, but few do so. RALOA\u2019s enactment and ASRAs\u2019 creation through the translation of 1999 \nand  2000  IASs  were  financed  and  supported  by  a  USAID  Accounting  Reform  TA  grant \napproved  in  1997.  ASRAs  themselves  have  been  declared  normative  bylaws  stipulated in \nRALOA.  In  addition,  all  enterprises  have  to  submit  their  financial  statements  to  the  tax \ninspectorate, whose requirements are different from ASRAs and IFRSs. \n \n7.  ASRA application has been based more on rules than on the principles that are the very \nrationale for IFRSs. As a result, the financial information disclosed by companies in Armenia \nremains perfunctory. ASRAs have not been updated since 2000, creating a standards gap in \nrelation  to  2008  IFRSs.  Legally,  RALOA  does  not  allow  amendments  to  ASRAs  without \nreference to the legislature. This gap can be addressed by adopting legislation in line with the \nEuropean Union\u2019s 8th Directive (EU8D).3 Financial institutions4 are, however, required by their \nfinancial  regulators  to  prepare  their  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  IFRSs.  The \nArmenian financial sector has moved more quickly in establishing its compliance requirements \nwith international norms than have other sectors. \n \n8.  The USAID Accounting Reform TA grant, approved in 1997, facilitated the establishment \nof the Association of Accountants and Auditors of Armenia (AAAA). It was USAID\u2019s intention \nthat AAAA become the professional self-regulatory organization (SRO) to regulate the country\u2019s \naccounting and auditing professions. In pursuit of this goal, USAID approved a second TA grant \nin 2002 to strengthen AAAA. Under this TA, AAAA adopted, with the help of the Institute of \nChartered Accountants of Scotland, the national accounting certification scheme syllabus of the \nAssociation of Certified Chartered Accountants of the United Kingdom. This certification scheme \nis  compliant  with  the  International  Education  Standards  of  the  International  Federation  of \n                                                 \n3  The EU8D on Accounting and Auditing Standards was revised on 17 May 2006 and provides for harmonizing \nfinancial reporting standards by accountants and auditors in the European Union in accordance with IFRSs and \nISAs. \n4  Comprising banks, insurance companies, mortgage companies, security trading companies, and pension funds. \n ", "12        Appendix 2   \nAccountants (IFAC). In 2005, after a visit and comprehensive assessment by IFAC staff, IFAC \nmade AAAA its associate member. \n \n9.  Notwithstanding  AAAA\u2019s  progress,  RALOA  mandates  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nEconomy (MOFE) as the supervisor and regulator of accounting standards in accordance with \nASRAs. MOFE continues to certify and license accountants and auditors. It has limited capacity \nto enforce compliance with ASRAs, and even less with IFRSs. This has encouraged financial \nstatements wrongly claiming to have followed IFRSs, thereby compromising on their truth and \nfairness.  \n \n10.  As a follow-up to its earlier interventions, USAID in 2007 approved yet another TA grant \nfor Financial Sector Deepening, whose activities began in June 2008. Under this TA, USAID \nfinances the translation into Armenian of certain IFRSs relevant to the financial sector, IFRSs 1\u2013\n8  and  certain  guidelines  of  the  Standards  Interpretation  Committee  of  the  International \nAccounting  Standards  Board  (IASB).  After  the  acquisition  in  2007  of  the  Armenian  stock \nexchange by a subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange, the demand for more transparent \ndisclosures from listed companies will increase. The USAID project\u2019s accounting component is \nan important link in this process. \n \n11.  The regulatory framework for auditing is provided by the Republic of Armenia\u2019s Law on \nAuditing  (RALAD),  enacted  in  2001.  RALAD  requires  legal  entities  in  Armenia  to  follow \nInternational Standards of Auditing (ISAs) prevalent in 2000. There have been no updates to \nthese  standards,  thereby  creating  a  standards  gap.  MOFE  licenses  auditors  who  obtain \nprofessional qualifications from it. MOFE\u2019s examination and qualification criteria for accountants \nand auditors are reported to be at variance with IFAC guidelines. There is no requirement in \nRALAD for practicing auditors to undergo a minimum continuing professional education (CPE) \nannually to retain their licenses. A clear need exists to draw a regulatory boundary between \nMOFE and AAAA in the efficient and prudential regulation of the accounting and auditing \nprofessions.  While  Government  oversight  over  the  accounting  and  auditing  profession  is \nnecessary, AAAA needs the operational autonomy to license and regulate auditors for quality \ncontrol and professional integrity. These functions are currently exercised by the Ministry of \nFinance. \n \n12.  The important areas needing attention but not covered by USAID\u2019s 2007 TA are \n(i)  translating into Armenian updates of ISAs; \n(ii)  translating into Armenian IFAC\u2019s ethics guidelines; \n(iii)  developing training programs for regulatory and professional agencies (training \nthe  trainers  and  regulators)  in  the  practical  application  of  IFRSs  and  the \nprudential enforcement of ISAs; \n(iv)  developing a proper mechanism for entry into and the retention of membership in \nthe accounting and auditing professions; \n(v)  developing mechanisms for quality control of audits in accordance with ISAs; \n(vi)  preparing CPE curricula for accountants and auditors in accordance with IFRSs, \nISAs, and international best practices; and \n(vii)  developing methodologies for reconciling IFRS-compliant financial statements \nwith those required by the tax inspectorate. \n \n13.  Armenia will therefore benefit considerably from the ADB TA, which will specifically \ncover the areas above and thereby complement the current USAID TA. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  13   \nC.  Azerbaijan \n \n14.  The World Bank\u2019s Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on \nAzerbaijan was published in September 2006. This document identified structural weaknesses \nin Azerbaijan\u2019s accounting and auditing policy and regulatory infrastructure. Azerbaijan\u2019s policy \nsince 2007 in accepting and addressing those weaknesses is noteworthy.  \n \n15.  Azerbaijan\u2019s Law on Accounting (AZLOA) was enacted in September 2004. AZLOA \nmandates the Ministry of Finance (MOF) with responsibility for implementation. Initially, AZLOA \nrequired all companies in Azerbaijan to follow Azerbaijan National Standards (AZNASs), which \nwere based on 1994 IASs. AZLOA was amended in 2007 (paras. 16\u201317 below). AZLOA now \nrequires all financial institutions and public interest enterprises5 to follow 2008 IFRS standards in \ntheir financial disclosures. Azerbaijani subsidiaries of foreign companies are required to follow \neither IFRSs or the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, depending on the \ncountry of incorporation of their holding companies. Other domestic companies are required to \nfollow AZNASs. Recognizing the standards gap between AZNASs as they existed in 2007 and \n2007 IFRSs, MOF translated (with the permission of IASB and IFAC) into Azeri 36 IASs and 8 \nIFRSs6  and, after obtaining the comments of the big four audit firms with offices in Azerbaijan, \nadopted 27 such standards through draft amendments to AZLOA.7 \n \n16.  In a far-reaching decision, an amendment was enacted to AZLOA in 2007, providing \nunder Article 6.02 for the automatic incorporation of future amendments into the law, and of \nfuture IFRS amendments and updated standards, directly into AZNASs without the need for \nfresh parliamentary approval for each standard or update separately. Based on the principle of \nthe EU8D on Accounting and Auditing, this amendment addresses a major impediment to the \nstandards gap.  \n \n17.  For addressing the compliance gap and improving transparency in companies\u2019 financial \ndisclosures, Articles 12.3.1 and 12.3.2 of AZLOA, as amended in 2007, require every public \ninterest enterprise and financial institution to publish its annual financial statements, and the \nauditors\u2019 opinions thereon, on their websites and in the local media. These entities\u2019 publications \nare required to state that their financial statements are published in accordance with IFRSs, as \nrequired by AZLOA. Other companies\u2019 declarations are required to state unequivocally that their \nfinancial statements are in accordance with AZNASs, as is required by AZLOA. As MOF is \nresponsible for executing and implementing all accounting standards under AZLOA, it is also \nresponsible under the law for supervising and enforcing companies\u2019 declarations. To reiterate \nthis prudential function, a presidential decree was issued in December 2007 providing to MOF \nadditional  powers  to  monitor  and  enforce  companies\u2019  compliance  with  this  provision  and \nrequiring  MOF  to  impose  penalties  on  companies  that  do  not  comply  with  this  statutory \nrequirement. MOF will benefit substantially from this TA through the education and training of its \nstaff in IFRSs to enable them to carry out MOF\u2019s mandated role diligently.  \n \n18.  Importantly, the Azerbaijan MOF\u2019s Accounting Policy Office provided for the drafting of \nAZLOA. The Government of Azerbaijan engaged in policy dialogue with the World Bank under \nthe policy loan (para. 20) and during the preparation of the ROSC, as well as with other \n                                                 \n5  A public interest enterprise is defined as one whose shares are listed on the country\u2019s stock exchange, as well as \nall financial institutions, public utilities, and other companies that provide public services. \n6   IASs 12, 29, 33, and 39\u201341 were not translated. \n7  The draft amendments were submitted to the cabinet of ministers on 11 April 2008 for approval and onward \ntransmission to Parliament.  \n ", "14        Appendix 2   \ninternational audit firms, in the formulation of its amendments to its AZLOA and Azerbaijan\u2019s \nLaw on Auditing Service (AZLAS).   \n \n19.  AZLAS was enacted in 1994, originally based on 1991 ISAs. It has since undergone \nseveral amendments and is due for major structural amendments in 2008. AZLAS provides for \ndelegating  to  the  Azerbaijan  Chamber  of  Auditors  (AZCOA)  functions  in  the  areas  of  (i) \nconducting examinations,  (ii)  controlling  entry  into  the  auditing  profession,  (iii)  professional \nethics,  (iv)  licensing  and  regulating  auditors,  (v)  quality  control  of  auditors,  (vi)  rights  and \nresponsibilities of auditors, and (vii) auditors\u2019 liabilities and disciplinary provisions. AZCOA is a \nprofessional accounting SRO established in 1996 and a full IFAC member. It receives no \nbudgetary support. As an SRO, it is independent of MOF, which according to AZLAS exercises \nno power over AZCOA\u2019s operations. Under AZLAS, MOF does not micromanage the auditing \nprofession. AZCOA nevertheless remains answerable to the Office of the President of the \nRepublic of Azerbaijan in the discharge of its legally mandated function. This arrangement \nmaintains the right balance of autonomy with accountability.   \n \n20.  The World Bank approved on 29 February 2008 a SDR7 million loan to Azerbaijan under \nthe Corporate and Public Sector Accountability Project. The third component of this project, \nStrengthening  Accounting,  Auditing  and  Financial  Management  Capacity,  includes  (i) \nestablishing  the  Azerbaijan  Center  for  Professional  Accounting,  Auditing,  Training,  and \nResearch under MOF, with broad responsibility for strengthening Azerbaijan\u2019s capacity; (ii) \nestablishing  accounting  and  auditing  educational  standards  for  universities\u2019  curricula  and \nhelping  them  deliver  on  the  standards;  (iii)  establishing  benchmark  for  professionals;  (iv) \ndeveloping an Azeri lexicon of accounting terminology; and (v) providing official translations of \nIFRSs. The World Bank loan partly addresses some of the challenges faced by Azerbaijan\u2019s \nauditing  profession.  Azerbaijan\u2019s  Central  Bank  received  USAID  technical  assistance  for \nenhancing financial institutions\u2019 disclosures in accordance with IFRSs. \n \n21.  Azerbaijan participated in an ADB TA approved in 2003 for Regional Financial Sector \nDevelopment.8 That TA focused on transparent financial disclosure and prudential financial \nregulation and supervision standards. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan \nparticipated  in  the  deliberations  of  this  TA.  The  TA  specifically  (i)  undertook  a  survey  of \ncompliance with IFRSs by nonfinancial joint stock companies (NFJSCs), (ii) helped MOFs to \nbegin  or  continue  implementing  IFRS  guidelines  based  on  best  international  practice,  (iii) \nidentified some constraints to IFRS implementation in NFJSCs, (iv) conducted practical IFRS \nworkshops for accountants from NFJSCs, and (v) conducted two regional training workshops on \nIFRS implementation for regulators and key participants in those countries. \n \n22.  To sustain the progress of its reforms undertaken thus far, Azerbaijan needs further \nassistance to (i) help MOF better exercise its mandate in enforcing companies\u2019 publication of \ntheir  financial  standards  and  (ii)  help  AZCOA  with  the  challenges  faced  by  the  auditing \nprofession by  (a) translating into Azeri updates of ISAs; (b) translating into Azeri IFAC\u2019s ethics \nguidelines; (c) developing training programs for regulatory and professional agencies (training \nthe trainers and regulators) in the practical application of IFRSs and prudential enforcement of \nISAs; (d) developing proper mechanisms for entry into and the retention of membership in the \naccounting and auditing professions; (e) developing mechanisms for quality control of audits in \naccordance with ISAs; (f) preparing CPE curricula for accountants and auditors in accordance \nwith IFRSs, ISAs, and international best practices; and (g) developing methodologies for the \nreconciling IFRS-compliant financial statements with those required by the tax inspectorate. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003.

In so doing, it will cover those areas not \nspecifically covered by other donors\u2019 interventions and thereby complement them. \n \nD.  Georgia \n \n23.  The present state of regulation of the accounting and auditing professions in Georgia is \nin need of significant reform. There is no single agency responsible for either (i) the holistic and \nprudential  supervision  and  regulation  of  the  accounting  and  auditing  professions,  (ii)  the \nimplementation of IFRSs, or (iii) the enforcement of ISAs. \n \n24.  The Georgia Law of Accounting (GLOA), enacted in 1999 with inputs from USAID TA \napproved in 1996, is outdated. Georgia\u2019s existing accounting standards according to GLOA are \nbased on 1999 IASs and do not correspond to IFRSs. According to GLOA, the Parliamentary \nCommission  on  Accounting  is  theoretically  responsible  for  approving  accounting  standards \ncompliant with IFRSs. In practice, however, the commission has neither office nor budget to \ncarry out its mandate. Under GLOA, only the commission is empowered to introduce normative \nlegislation  to  incorporate  IFRS  standards,  but  it  has  been  unable  to  enforce  companies\u2019 \napplication of IFRSs. \n \n25.  The major impediments to the adoption of IFRS are (i) a standards gap, (ii) a compliance \ngap, and (iii) faulty IFRS-tax accounts reconciliation. The standards gap arose from the time lag \nbetween the introduction of an IFRS standard by IASB and its incorporation into Georgian law.  \n \n26.  The compliance gap poses more serious problems. It arises from accountants\u2019 lack of \nknowledge  of  IFRSs,  partly  because  of  their  conceptual problem  in  understanding  accrual \naccounting. It has resulted in them certifying financial statements as being IFRS compliant when \nthey are not so in reality. This materially affects the truth and fairness of disclosures in such \nfinancial statements, which therefore cannot be used. Georgian financial statements deviate \nfrom IFRSs notably in (i) the consolidation of the accounts of affiliated companies; (ii) provisions \nfor impairment of assets; (iii) related parities disclosure; and (iv) the valuation of property, plant, \nand equipment. They are therefore fundamentally different from parities followed under all \nrecognized double-entry accrual accounting systems and can therefore not be relied on. At \npresent only banks, insurance companies, and other financial companies follow near IFRSs. \nThe country\u2019s central bank regulates financial institutions\u2019 compliance with banks\u2019 adherence to \nIFRSs  and  ISAs.  The  State  Insurance  Supervision  Service  does  the  same  for  insurance \ncompanies. Even in banking and insurance companies\u2019 financial statements, serious deviations \nfrom IFRSs have been reported.9 For nonfinancial undertakings, there is no single regulator \nresponsible for the oversight of company financial statements. Other companies\u2019 compliance \nwith either IFRSs or even Georgia\u2019s own outdated accounting standards therefore remains poor. \n \n27.  Georgia\u2019s compliance gap is further exacerbated by the country\u2019s tax requirements. Like \nin other FSU countries, Georgian tax law recognizes only cash-based accounting, and many \ncompanies prefer following cash-based accounting. The tax authorities have been unwilling to \naccept  IFRS-defined  income  for  taxation  or  offer  methodologies  for  reconciling  income \naccording to tax legislation and IFRSs. \n \n28.  Auditing in Georgia is governed by the Law on Auditing, enacted in 1995. The licensing \nof auditors has been abolished. One SRO, the Georgia Federation of Professional Accountants \nand Auditors (GFPAA), is responsible for training accountants and auditors. GFPAA is the only \n                                                 \n9  World Bank. 2007. Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes\u2013Georgia. Washington, D.C. (January). \n ", "16        Appendix 2   \nSRO in Georgia that is an IFAC member. GFPAA has translated some IFRSs and ISAs into \nGeorgian. GFPAA is also responsible for the education of accountants and auditors and setting \nstandards. GFPAA is, however, only one of the organizations that may certify auditors. For \ndoing so, GFPAA requires candidates to undergo 3 years\u2019 training to obtain a diploma, using the \ntranslated syllabus of the Association of Certified Chartered Accountants of London. Another \nagency in Georgia, the Audit Council, is also empowered to issue certificates to accountants, \nusing much lower entry barriers. The Audit Council is a Soviet-era relic and not an IFAC \nmember. This certifies a plethora of poorly qualified accountants and auditors practicing in \nGeorgia. GFPAA can initiate disciplinary action against only its members and not against those \ncertified by the Audit Council.  It is absolutely necessary to have rigorous quality control of \nauditors to ensure the high quality of audits. This can be facilitated only by ensuring that \nagencies certifying auditors are themselves professionally credible. Moreover, audits are no \nlonger mandatory except for financial institutions and listed companies. Exemption encourages \nlax standards.  \n \n29.  Unlike in the United States, with its Public Companies Accounting Oversight Board, or \nthe  United  Kingdom,  with  its  Financial  Regulation  Council,  there  is  no  external  agency \nresponsible  for  the  prudential  oversight  of  GFPAA  in  Georgia.  Georgia\u2019s  accounting  and \nauditing oversight has not taken into account post Sarbanes-Oxley practices in other developed \ncountries. In Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, however, it has been \nincreasingly recognized in the past several years that the accounting and auditing professions \nneed external oversight to avoid members\u2019 possible conflict of interest from corporate and \nfinancial governance perspectives. This tautology, whose validity is recognized for developed \ncountries, is even more relevant for transitional ones such as Georgia, where independent \ninstitutions are still not fully developed. External prudential oversight over the accounting and \nauditing professions is therefore of utmost importance. \n \n30.  A new consolidated law on accounting and auditing was drafted in 2007 but has not \nbeen approved by Parliament. The proposed law was intended to (i) provide for the application \nof  harmonized  and  IFRS-compliant  accounting  disclosure  standards  for  all  companies  in \nGeorgia, except for small and medium-sized enterprises; (ii) facilitate the automatic import of \nIFRS updates into the proposed law based on the EU8D on Accounting and Auditing (which \nwould allow for the seamless integration of Georgian accounting standards with IFRSs, without \nthe need for legislative approval for each IFRS separately); and (iii) provide for regulating entry \ninto  the  accounting  profession  by  raising  professional  entry  barriers  consistent  with  best \ninternational  practice.  Enactment  by  Parliament  could  significantly  improve  Georgia\u2019s \naccounting and auditing regulatory infrastructure. \n \n31.  The current TA prepares for the enactment of the new law on accounting and auditing \nand can benefit Georgia by (i) educating accountants and auditor members of GFPAA in the \napplication of IFRSs and the enforcement of ISAs; (ii) provide a methodology for reconciling \nIFRS financial statements with those required under domestic tax laws; and (iii) translating into \nGeorgian the relevant IFRSs, ISAs, and other IFAC guidelines.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  17 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nInvestment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional   \nCooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facilitya \n  1.
