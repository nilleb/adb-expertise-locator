INTRODUCTION \n1.  Building  the  capacity  of  Pacific  supreme  audit  institutions  (SAIs)  is  fundamental  to \nimproving  regional  governance.  Public  auditing  in  the  Pacific  region  overall  has  advanced \nsubstantially in the past decade. Numerous audit backlogs have been cleared, and both audit \nquality and the performance of almost all Pacific SAIs have improved. These gains have been \nmade in the face of intimidating challenges. Sustaining such gains is difficult in smaller country \nsettings  because  auditing  in  tight-knit  social  and  cultural  environments  involves  significant \npolitical, professional, and personal pressures. In addition, Pacific SAIs are at different stages of \ndevelopment and, for some, much more remains to be done to reach uniformly high standards. \n \n2.  In October 2005, Pacific Islands Forum1 (PIF) leaders endorsed for further study and \nanalysis the Pacific Plan initiative 12.1, which included the Pacific Regional Audit Initiative \n(PRAI).2 The PRAI design was subsequently developed by the Pacific Association of Supreme \nAudit Institutions (PASAI),3 with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the \nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID), under the coordination of the PIF \nSecretariat.4 The August 2008 PIF Leaders\u2019 meeting endorsed the PRAI design. Following this \nendorsement, ADB, AusAID, and the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions \n(INTOSAI) Development Initiative supported the successful initial implementation and delivery of \nPRAI outputs from 2008 to 2010.5 \n \n3.  The proposed regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) will support the \ncontinued implementation of the PRAI in Pacific island countries and has been developed in \nconsultation with the PASAI secretariat and development partners.6 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Pacific SAIs face similar challenges in the areas of human resource capacity and the \neffectiveness  of  their  audit  methodologies,  systems,  and  governing  legislation.  Common \nchallenges  include  small  numbers  of  trained  and  qualified  personnel,  the  disproportionate \neffects  of  staff turnover  or  absences,  outdated  audit methodologies,  inefficient governance \narrangements, and legislation that does not provide for the appropriate independence of the \naudit function. These issues mean that public accounts are often not audited to high standards \nin a timely manner and legislatures do not always act on audit findings and recommendations. \nTo be effective, SAIs must (i) audit all entities within the audit portfolio, (ii) issue timely audit \n                                                \n1  PIF member countries are Australia, the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, \nNew Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, \nand Vanuatu. \n2  Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2005.

Manila (TA 6499-REG, for $1,900,000, approved on 3 November 2008, cofinanced by the Japan \nSpecial Fund and the Government of Australia). \n6  The PRAI is supporting the audit institutions in American Samoa, the Cook Islands, the Federated States of \nMicronesia (including the state audit institutions in Pohnpei, Kosrae, and Yap), French Polynesia, Fiji, Guam, \nKiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, \nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n ", "2 \nopinions and reports, (iii) be managed effectively with well-qualified staff, (iv) have a modern \nrisk-based audit methodology, and (v) be independent of the legislature and the executive. \n \n5.  To address these issues, the PRAI design was developed during a 2-year period of \nconsultation with participating countries, development partners, regional organizations, and civil \nsociety. During the initial implementation period of the PRAI (2008\u20132010), progress has been \nmade under each of the four project output areas as follows: \n(i)  Regional cooperation. Regional cooperation and coordination of audit activities \nbetween SAIs has been strengthened. A new PASAI Charter was developed and \napproved by the 12th Congress of PASAI in Palau in July 2009. In addition, as \npart of moving to the new strengthened institutional arrangements for PASAI, a \ngoverning  board  was  established  and  membership  was  agreed  at  the  12th \nCongress. A small secretariat for PASAI was officially opened in January 2010. \n(ii)  Organizational capacity. Initiatives to enhance the organizational capacity of \nSAIs are ongoing. A PASAI Capacity Development Program was presented to \nthe  12th  PASAI  Congress  and  endorsed  for  implementation.  The  INTOSAI \nDevelopment Initiative is funding a staff position in the PASAI  secretariat to \nimplement the Capacity Development Program. \n(iii)  Technical ability. A cooperative performance audit has been undertaken in the \nPacific region on the topic of waste management involving 10 PASAI members \nusing a common methodology. In addition, the Subregional Audit Support (SAS) \nProgram has completed its first phase. The program is using a unique model to \ndeal with public auditing challenges by pooling resources on a subregional basis. \nThe program is working to raise the quality of public auditing in Kiribati, Nauru, \nand Tuvalu through the establishment of a team of secondees from each of the \nparticipating countries, supported by specialist audit expertise. Through such \ninitiatives, SAIs\u2019 technical ability to undertake financial and performance audits is \nbeing strengthened. \n(iv)  Transparency  and  accountability.  SAIs  are  now  collectively  advocating \ntransparency  and  accountability.  The  first  PASAI  annual  report  on  regional \naccountability  and  transparency  issues  (linked  to  PIF\u2019s  Eight  Principles  of \nAccountability) has been published.7 The report will become an annual document \non the state of accountability and transparency in the Pacific region. \n \n6.  A 3-year work plan for PASAI has been developed and was reviewed by PASAI's \ngoverning  board  and  development  partners  in  November  2009.8 As  part  of  this  review, \nimplementation lessons to date were considered in the finalization of the plan, in particular the \nneed  to  ensure  adequate  logistical  and  administrative  support  for  the  implementation  of \nactivities both at the preparatory stage and while they are underway. The proposed TA will \nsupport the implementation of the plan in cooperation with other development partners. \n \n7.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Pacific  Approach,  2010\u20132014,  which  identifies \ncontinued  support  to  good  governance  and  regional  cooperation  and  integration  activities, \nincluding public financial management. 9 Furthermore, in supporting the Paris Declaration on Aid \nEffectiveness, recipient countries have committed to publishing timely, transparent, and reliable \naudited financial reports, while development partners (including ADB) have committed to relying, \n                                                \n7  PIF. 1997.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will support public entities in Pacific island countries to improve transparency \nand accountability in managing and using their public resources. The outcome of the TA will be \nthat SAIs in the participating states will operate in accordance with uniform standards at a \nmeasurably higher level. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will deliver the following outputs (and associated activities) during the remainder \nof the PRAI program period (2011\u20132013): \n \n(i)  Strengthened  regional  cooperation  and  coordination  of  audit  activities \namong SAIs. The TA will support (i) the development of a strategy and plan for \nmoving toward a common financial audit methodology; and (iii) the development \nof a rolling program for cooperative performance audits and peer reviews. \n \n(ii)  Enhanced organizational capacity of SAIs. One of the founding principles of \nthe PRAI is that the appropriate involvement of private sector auditors in public \nsector  auditing,  under  the  auspices  of  SAI  heads,  will  be  supported  and \npromoted.13 The TA will develop a generic model for contracting out and assuring \nthe quality of audits completed by private sector auditors on behalf of the SAI. \nGuidelines will also be prepared on contract management and the engagement \nof  specialists.  The  PASAI  secretariat  will  provide  direct  advice  to  SAIs  on \nnegotiating and managing contracted-out audits. \n \nPeer reviews are internationally accepted as an effective quality assurance tool. \nINTOSAI has developed peer review standards14 and peer reviews are required \nby the United States (US) Government Auditing Standards. Moreover, US insular \nareas in the Pacific have already successfully introduced a peer review program. \nRecognizing INTOSAI progress on peer review standards, the TA will work with \nSAIs to develop peer review guidelines and establish and support peer review \nteams.  Moreover,  the  peer  review  process  will  help  support  institutional \nstrengthening requirements and approaches. \n \n                                                \n10 High Level Forum. 2005.

Cooperative audits involve multiple audit institutions working together on \na single audit. They also enable high quality audit services to be delivered\u2014\nparticularly  in  specialist  or  complex  areas\u2014and  support  effective  capacity \ndevelopment. The TA will support the completion of the Pacific region\u2019s second \ncooperative performance audit using this approach. \n \nThe TA will also support the second phase of the SAS program for Kiribati, Nauru, \nand Tuvalu.15 The program\u2019s objective is to enable the public accounts of these \ncountries to be audited to uniformly high standards in a timely manner. The \nprogram will also strengthen in-country public financial management capacity and \nenhance accountability mechanisms. \n \n Few  SAIs  are  large  enough  to  establish  and  sustain  the  in-house  technical \ncapacity that is necessary to respond effectively to the increasingly complex \nfinancial reporting and auditing environment. Recognizing the benefits of regional \neconomies of scale, the TA will provide advice to SAIs on technical accounting \nand audit issues, and related issues, such as approaches to align governing \nlegislation with INTOSAI\u2019s Mexico Declaration on SAI Independence.16 \n \n(iv)  Collective advocacy for transparency and accountability. In keeping with the \nPIF\u2019s  Eight  Principles  of  Accountability,17 the  PASAI  secretariat,  under  the \nguidance of the PASAI governing board, will prepare and publish an annual \nreport on the regional status of SAI independence, the progress in addressing \naudit  findings,  and  an  assessment  of  other  issues  of  transparency  and \naccountability in the Pacific region. \n \n10.  The outputs are described in detail in the PRAI summary design document18 and the \nPASAI 3-year work plan.19 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000 equivalent, of which $1,300,000 will be financed \non  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  administered  by  ADB. \nParticipating governments will provide $200,000 through in-kind contributions (Appendix 2). The \ntotal cost of the PRAI, including the PASAI secretariat, over the remainder of the PRAI program \nperiod (2011\u20132013) is to be jointly funded with AusAID, the INTOSAI Development Initiative, \nand the World Bank. \n \n                                                \n15 The subregional group reflects their geographical adjacency (albeit transport links are indirect), indications of \ninterest, small populations, currency unit (Australian dollars), and similar auditing and accounting environments. \n16 INTOSAI. 2007.

Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB will be the executing agency and the PASAI secretariat will be the implementing \nagency.20 Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n13.  The TA will require international consultants (estimated 31 person-months of inputs) with \nskills and expertise in public auditing, performance auditing, and undertaking peer reviews. All \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  as  individuals.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). TA activities will be implemented over 30 months, starting in March 2011. The expected \nfinancial  completion  date  of  the  TA  is  February  2014.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  Monitoring of the broader aims of the TA will draw on the findings of assessments by \nADB and development partners. A full evaluation is planned at the end of the PRAI design \nprogram period (2013). This will include measuring the performance of each PASAI member \nagainst  the  PASAI  capability  model.21 Ongoing  monitoring  of  activities  will  be  undertaken \nthrough regular meetings of the PASAI governing board. Good practices and lessons will be \ndisseminated throughout the implementation of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,300,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Implementing the Pacific Regional \nAudit Initiative, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n20 PASAI operates a small secretariat located in Auckland, which is back-stopped by the New Zealand Office of the \nController and Auditor-General. \n21 The PASAI capability model considers the status of five attributes: (i) audit types, (ii) audit management, (iii) office \nmanagement, (iv) human resource management, and (v) information and communication technology.
