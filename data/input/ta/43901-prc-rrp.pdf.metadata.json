The proceeds of the Loan will be channeled as a part of CEEEL's investment \nin project companies that will be established to build and operate WTE plants with clean \ntechnologies in secondary cities in the PRC .1 If approved, the Project will be ADB\u2019s first private \nsector project to assist municipal WTE projects. It will constitute ADB\u2019s 26th private sector \nassistance in the PRC. This report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA). If the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve ADB\u2019s administering the TA grant not exceeding the equivalent of $653,000 from the \nClean Energy Fund2 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Municipal Solid Waste Management \n1.  Issues and Technologies \n2.  Municipal solid waste (MSW) is a waste type consisting principally of household waste, \nbut includes commercial waste, generated in municipal areas. It is estimated that 5.2 million tons \nof  solid  waste  is  generated  daily  worldwide,  of  which  3.8  million  tons  is  from  developing \ncountries.3 The failure to manage MSW appropriately causes serious local, regional, and global \nenvironmental problems such as air pollution, soil and groundwater contamination, and emissions \nof greenhouse gasses, methane (CH ) in particular. \n4\n \n3.  The goal of MSW management is to treat MSW in an environmentally and socially \nacceptable manner with appropriate clean technologies. The three main MSW treatment options \nare landfill, composting, and incineration. All waste disposal alternatives eventually decompose \norganic materials into simpler carbon molecules such as carbon dioxide (CO ) and/or CH . In \n2 4\ndeveloped countries with rich experience in waste management, incineration is recognized as the \nsingle most effective method for MSW treatment,4 as it reduces waste volume by 90% and \neliminates  CH   emissions.  Furthermore,  WTE  technologies  recover  the  waste  heat  from \n4\nincineration process and steadily produce electricity and heat. By substituting for fossil fuel \ncombustion and avoiding CH , it reduces greenhouse gas emissions and mitigates climate \n4\nchange. Using abundant MSW as fuel makes WTE plants attractive and dependable sources of \nrenewable energy.  \n                                                 \n1 \u201cPrimary cities\" include Beijing, Dalian, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Shanghai, Shantou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Xiamen, and \nZhuhai. \"Secondary cities\" are provincial capitols, if the province is not a \u201csuper province\u201d such as Guangdong, and \nother regionally important cities. \n2 Contributors are the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n3 Cointreau, S. 2007.

Municipal Solid Waste Incineration \u2013Decision Maker\u2019s Guide. Washington, DC. \n ", "2   \n2.  Municipal Solid Waste Management in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n4.  Successful  economic  reforms  and  significant  growth  in  the  PRC  economy  have \naccelerated urbanization5 and led to increases in MSW generation by 8\u201310% annually.6 The \nPRC is now the world's largest MSW generator, producing 148 million tons annually. Yet the \nPRC's per capita MSW is still only 120 kilograms (kg) per annum, which is less than a quarter of \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average of 560 kg per \nannum, leaving significant upward potential.7 \n \n5.  The effective disposal of MSW has been a serious environmental challenge in the PRC.  \nNearly 50%8 of MSW is untreated and dumped in un-engineered landfills that contaminate soil \nand groundwater. This is a particular problem in coastal regions, which have high groundwater \ntables and land values. Emission control and leachate treatment in engineered landfills often \nunderperform in the PRC for lack of adequate clean technologies and operational know-how.9  \n \n6.  This also poses a serious social challenge, as ever increasing numbers of migrants from \nrural areas often live near polluting landfills, making them vulnerable to the air pollution and soil \ncontamination. The urban poor are exposed to infectious diseases from MSW and respiratory \ndiseases from air pollution, threats to access to safe drinking water, and the risk of food poisoning \nfrom soil and groundwater contamination. Therefore, a more integrated approach to developing \nan efficient, environmentally sustainable, and well-managed MSW system is needed. \n \n3.  Waste  to  Energy  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Private  Sector \nParticipation \n7.  The promotion of WTE technologies has been seen as an effective way to mitigate \nenvironmental degradation, but it challenges the capacity of local governments to promote good \nWTE infrastructure with sustainable financing and the timely delivery of public services. Up to \n2007, only 67 WTE plants have been built since the first in 1988. They process 11 million tons \nannually, or only 7.6% of the MSW generated. By 2020, the WTE market is projected to more than \nquadruple to 47 million tons, and the investment required to meet projected incineration demand \nis estimated at over CNY70 billion ($10 billion). \n \n8.  Most WTE developers in the PRC have used locally produced circulating fluidized bed \n(CFB) incinerators, which require supplemental fuels10 of up to 20-30% coal to burn MSW. The \nextensive use of coal without adequate emission control may worsen urban air pollution. The \nsubstantial deployment of clean WTE technologies is urgently needed. \n \n9.  The Government alone cannot continue to be the main funding source for WTE expansion \nwith clean technologies. Private sector participation through public-private partnership (PPP) is \nexpected to play a critical role in improving the sector by (i) providing capital for new investment; \n(ii)  bringing  in  advanced  technology,  management,  and  operations;  (iii)  helping  municipal \n                                                 \n5 The PRC is undergoing massive urbanization, with over 41% of its population already living in urban areas, more than \ndouble the rate of less than 18% in 1978. \n6 Nie, Y. 2008. Development and Prospects of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Incineration in China. Frontiers of \nEnvironmental Science and Engineering in China Vol. 2, No.1. Beijing: Higher Education Press. \n7 Assuming a relatively conservative 3% annual MSW increase, MSW generation in the PRC is projected to be 224 \nmillion tons in 2020. \n8 Among the 661 municipalities throughout the country, 334 cities do not have any MSW treatment facilities. In terms of \nthe waste collected, only 52% was treated in 2006, while the remainder was disposed of in unimproved landfills. \n9 Altogether, 90.5% of MSW collected in the PRC was dumped into landfills in 2006. \n10 Supplemental fuels mean fuel to be added during operation (after start-up) to burn MSW. \n ", "  3 \ngovernments to mitigate environmental impacts; and to free up limited public funds for other \nimportant social spending. \n \n10.  In 2006, China Everbright International Limited (CEIL), the project sponsor, commenced \ncommercial operation of the first project in the PRC to adopt advanced clean technologies, \nincluding grate incinerator technology, which is state-of-the-art, reliable technology in the United \nStates and Europe and does not require coal as supplemental fuel; and advanced flue gas \nemission control to meet the world's most stringent standards, such as the European Union II \nstandard for dioxin.  \n \n4.  Policies and Regulations \n11.  In the 1980s, the Government of the PRC began studying and addressing the challenges \nof prospective energy supply shortages and environmental degradation stemming from the \nfast-growing  economy.  Following  rapid  economic  development,  the  Government  further \nemphasized environmental protection at the 17th Chinese Communist Party Congress and the \nChina Central Economic Works Conference in 2007. It urged the country to pursue scientific \ndevelopment and included in its aims building a society conscious of environmental issues and \nenergy conservation. In November 2007, 18 Government ministries jointly published the Action \nPlan for Environmental Protection and Good Health in China (2007\u20132015), which strengthened \npeople-orientated environmental protection policies. \n \n12.  To promote waste management and WTE, the Government enacted a series of laws and \nregulations. The Law on the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution from Solid Waste \n(2004) provides the basic framework for treating different kinds of wastes, and the Urban \nDomestic Waste Management Regulations (2007), the most recent and comprehensive laws in \nthe PRC, address urban environmental protection and waste management. Further, WTE was \nidentified as a key source of renewable energy in the Renewable Energy Law (2005). The \nGovernment has passed new regulations under which grid companies are obliged to take all \nelectricity generated from qualified WTE plants in its grid area and offer a price premium.  \n \n13.  Under the 11th Five Year Plan (2006\u20132010), the Government sets the development of a \nrecycling economy as a national goal. Establishing a resource recycling system for the whole \nsociety is emphasized in accordance with the principle of resource use reduction, reutilization, \nand  conservation.  Primary  cities  such  as  Beijing  started  segregating  MSW  for  recycling. \nMeanwhile, the Government set a long-term target for WTE, thermal recycling, to increase from \n1% of the total waste managed in 2002 to 30% by 2030. The Government has strengthened its \ncommitment  to  renewable  resources  generally  through  investment  and  favorable  taxation \npolicies, and specifically in relation to WTE, having made a high priority of developing the \nnecessary technology. Other relevant targets in the 11th Five Year Plan include (i) investing \nCNY1,375 billion ($200 billion) in environmental protection;11 (ii) 35% of the MSW in the eastern \ncoastal area to be treated through WTE; and (iii) the daily treatment capacity of MSW to be \nincreased by 320,000 tons.  \n \n                                                 \n11 In addition, environmental protection was identified as one of the 10 priority investment areas in the stimulus \npackage. \n ", "4   \nB.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n1.  Country Strategy \n14.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC12 is based on four development thrusts: \n(i) inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  (ii)  resource  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability, (iii) regional cooperation and public goods, and (iv) an environment conducive to \nprivate sector development.   \n \n15.  The PRC has been steadily transforming into a market economy, which has become the \ndriving force for economic growth and job creation. In addition to ADB\u2019s policy advice to the \nGovernment on private sector development, ADB provides project-based financial assistance. \nADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on infrastructure, energy, finance, and \nenvironmental improvement. Regarding infrastructure and energy, ADB prioritizes pioneering \nprojects  with  innovative  contractual  and  financial  structuring  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation, enhance management expertise, and improve corporate governance.  \n \n2.  Strategy 2020 \n16.  ADB's long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)13 emphasizes ADB\u2019s \nsupport for achieving poverty reduction and inclusive growth through environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment and private sector development. The Project is in line with infrastructure and \nenvironment  being  two  of  the  five  core  areas  of  operations  in  the  strategy.  In  terms  of \ninfrastructure, specifically energy, the Project will embody the strategy, which sets forth that ADB \nwill (i) help expand the supply of energy; (ii) promote energy efficiency through supply-side and \ndemand-side measures; (iii) support clean energy; and (iv) facilitate the removal of policy, \ninstitutional, regulatory, technological, and legal constraints on promoting efficient energy use. \nWith respect to the environment, the Project is in line with the strategy's focus on (i) climate \nchange, (ii) livable cities, and (iii) complementary actions. The strategy also aims to promote a \nlarger role for the private sector in financing infrastructure by supporting PPP. \n \n17.  In addition to consistency with the strategy's operational priorities, the proposed Project \nwill contribute to achieving results in areas under the strategy\u2019s results framework. The proposed \nProject will contribute to regional outcomes by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which \naddresses the global climate challenge. Its contribution to country outcomes is significant in \nimprovement of the urban environment through clean energy and improved MSW management. \nThe Project will contribute to operational effectiveness as well by bundling multiple medium-sized \nWTE projects, which is an innovative structure to reduce transaction costs.  \n \n3.  Energy Sector Strategy \n18.  ADB seeks to meet energy security, facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy, and \nachieve ADB\u2019s vision of a region free of poverty. ADB also seeks to help developing member \ncountries (DMCs) to provide reliable, adequate, and affordable energy supplies for inclusive \ngrowth in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way. ADB applies three pillars \nfor policy implementation: (i) promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy; (ii) maximizing \naccess  to  energy  for  all;  and  (iii)  promoting  energy  sector  reform,  capacity  building,  and \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2008.

The existing and proposed WTE plants will generate renewable energy in an \neconomically  and  environmentally  sustainable  manner.  The  Project  also  promotes  energy \nefficiency with advanced and cleaner technologies.  \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Description \n19.  The Project is to support the construction and operation through PPP of CEIL's WTE \nprojects with advanced clean technologies including grate incinerator technology, and advanced \nflue gas emission control. This will serve the need to treat MSW in secondary cities of the PRC \nand supply electricity to the local grid. Each WTE plant incinerates waste, recovers waste heat for \npower generation, purifies waste gas, treats leachate, and disposes of ash. CEEEL, a wholly \nowned subsidiary of CEIL, was set up to hold CEIL's WTE operations. The portfolio approach, \nbroad in reach, will enable ADB to provide financing support for multiple WTE projects that are \noften too small for ADB or international banks to finance on a standalone basis. \nB.  Financing Clean Technologies \n20.  Despite the recent policy shift in favor of WTE and the increased interest of municipal \ngovernments in clean technologies, market barriers still limit the expansion of WTE projects with \nclean technologies in the PRC. One of the key bottlenecks is the lack of access to finance, leaving \nmunicipalities' demand unmet.  \n \n21.  According to comments obtained through ADB\u2019s Energy Efficiency Initiative consultation \nprocess and project due diligence, the main reasons why financially viable clean technology \nprojects fail to attract finance are as follows: \n(i)  There are gaps in clean technology knowledge and misperceptions of actual \ntechnology risks.  \n(ii)  Clean technologies require higher initial capital expenditure, making the total \ninvestment requirement higher, while commercial banks are often unfamiliar with \nenvironment and health benefits that are difficult to quantify. \n(iii)  The due diligence costs associated with WTE projects with clean technologies are \nhigh because of the need for technical evaluation regardless of the project size. \n(iv)  Under PPP arrangements, municipal governments often require private sector \npartners to fund project equity in hard currency. However, availability of long-term \nloan to finance project equity, in US dollar in particular, is limited. \n  \n22.  A window of opportunity exists for ADB to make a real impact in the emerging WTE sector \nwith clean technologies in the PRC. Under the Project, the ADB loan will be provided to a holding \ncompany and channeled to the WTE project companies, playing an anchor role to mobilize local \nfunds and create better awareness among international banks. \n \nC.  Sponsor \n23.  Since its establishment in 1993, CEIL has become one of the leading private companies in \nthe environmental protection industry in the PRC. Following the Government\u2019s policy to introduce \nthe  private  sector  participation  in  the  environment  sector  in  2003,  CEIL  has  focused  on \nenvironmental protection infrastructure including WTE and wastewater treatment. CEIL has so far \n ", "6   \nbeen awarded concessions to operate environmental protraction projects in Suzhou, Yixing, and \nChangzhou in Jiangsu Province and Jinan, Qingdao, Zibo, and Binzhou in Shandong Province.  \n \n1.  Shareholders \n24.  CEIL is a private company established in Hong Kong and listed on the main board of the \nHong Kong Stock Exchange (stock code 257). The majority shareholder is China Everbright \nHoldings Company Limited (CEHCL), a company established in Hong Kong that holds over 56% \nof CEIL's issued share capital. CEHCL is owned by the state-owned China Everbright Group, \nwhich is under the supervision of the State Council of the PRC. The group held total assets of \napproximately CNY800 billion in 2007 and had over 18,000 employees.  \n \n2.  Operations \n25.  CEIL's  main  environmental  protection  services  include  solid  waste  and  wastewater \ntreatment. As of the end of 2008, CEIL managed 22 environmental protection projects with an \nannual WTE processing capacity of 1.5 million tons, annual on-grid power generation capacity of \n450 GWh, daily wastewater treatment capacity of 1.5 million tons, and other waste treatment \ncapacity of 20,000 cubic meters per annum.  \n \n26.   CEIL's board of directors has 10 directors, of which seven are executive directors and the \nremaining three are independent nonexecutive directors.  \n \n27.  CEIL will be responsible for identifying, evaluating, selecting, negotiating, implementing, \nand administering the WTE projects. CEIL aims to set the bar high for the industry by achieving \ninternational best practices and technologies.  \n \nD.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environment, Safety, and Health \n28.  The Project is categorized as FI in accordance with ADB's Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines (2003), and CEIL will adopt an environmental and social management system (ESMS) \nin  compliance  with  ADB's  Environment  Policy  (2002).  WTE  plants  have  required  a  full \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) in the PRC since 2002, and any future WTE subprojects \nidentified for ADB finance will follow the EIA and disclosure procedures as required by both the \nGovernment and ADB. WTE plants have been well regulated in the PRC, with emission standards \nin place, and the implementation of environmental mitigation will be closely monitored by both \nnational and local governments.  \n \n29.  CEIL\u2019s  experience  with  its  existing  plants  ensures  that  the  environmental  impacts \nassociated with WTE plants are well identified and that adequate mitigation measures and \nmonitoring programs are in place. Flue gas emissions from the WTE plants will meet ADB \nsafeguard requirements and national standards, and CEIL has set out to meet more stringent \nstandards, such as the European Union II standard for dioxin of 0.10 nanograms (ng) international \ntoxicity equivalent per normal cubic meter (I-TEQ/Nm3), which is 10 times more stringent than the \nChinese requirement and twice as stringent as the World Bank\u2013International Finance Corporation \nstandard of 0.22 ng I-TEQ/Nm3. Fly ash will be treated with solidification technologies before \ndisposal in designated landfills. The WTE plant site location will be selected by the municipal \ngovernment to minimize environmental impacts on communities and the environment. \n \n ", "  7 \n2.  Social \n30.  The Project is classified as involuntary resettlement category B and indigenous peoples \ncategory C. Land acquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation needs are not \nsignificant and, if needed, are normally carried out by the municipal governments before the \nconcessions are opened for competition. This means that CEIL has only a limited role in this \nregard. Nonetheless, CEIL will adopt a resettlement framework that sets out the policy principles \nand the screening, due diligence, and resettlement planning process in the event of involuntary \nresettlement, to ensure that national requirements are met and ADB's Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995) requirements are complied with in ADB-financed subprojects. As the subprojects \nwill be located in urban areas, the Project will not have significant impact on indigenous peoples.  \n \nE.  Development Impacts \n31.  The Project aims to promote environmental improvement in the PRC by contributing to \nresolving urban environmental problems caused by untreated MSW, which contaminates soil and \nemits harmful gasses. The impact of catalyzing private sector investment in the PRC\u2019s emerging \nWTE industry with the deployment of clean technologies will improve the urban environment and \nmitigate  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  avoiding  CH   emissions  and  replacing  electricity \n4\ngenerated by coal-fired plants.  \n \n32.  The Project features a strong model for private sector participation in WTE through a PPP \nfor multiple projects in medium-sized municipalities and thus encourages, with multi-faceted \ndemonstration effects, the private sector to invest in WTE projects beyond the Project\u2019s specific \ninterventions. First, it will encourage other private investors to invest in WTE projects with clean \ntechnologies. Second, by mobilizing available domestic funds, ADB can create better awareness \namong commercial banks and willingness to finance more WTE projects with clean technologies. \nThird, the Project will demonstrate a new mechanism to provide a long-term, reliable solution to \naddress MSW problems, which is applicable to other municipalities in PRC and in line with the \nGovernment  policy  to  promote  a  resources-saving  society.  TA  will  ensure  information \ndissemination to municipal governments and policy makers. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Loan \n33.  ADB's proposed loan is an A-loan of up to $100 million funded by ADB and a B-loan of up \nto $100 million funded by international banks, made to CEEEL and supported by a full, irrevocable \nguarantee from CEIL. The A-loan will carry an interest rate, as well as commitment and front-end \nfees, to be approved by ADB\u2019s pricing and credit enhancement committee. The Borrower may \nhave the right to convert the interest rate from a floating rate to a fixed rate or vice versa on terms \nagreed between ADB and the Borrower.  \n \n34.  The B-loan of up to $100 million will have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the \nA-loan and be on terms and conditions agreed by the Borrower, CEIL, participating banks, and \nADB. ADB will charge an annual administration fee determined by ADB\u2019s pricing and credit \nenhancement committee. \n \n ", "8   \nB.  Technical Assistance \n1.  Impact, Key Activities, and Output \n35.  As ADB's first private sector project to provide assistance to municipal WTE projects, the \nproposed Project will facilitate the deployment of advanced and clean WTE technologies that do \nnot require supplemental fuel and can therefore meet high environmental standards, ensure \nproject implementation, and demonstrate WTE as a solution to MSW disposal in the PRC and \nother DMCs. The lessons learned will be disseminated to municipal governments. The TA will \nhave two components: (i) assessment and evaluation of operational performance of the WTE \nplants, and (ii) capacity building in CEIL in environmental management in relation to WTE \ntechnologies. The TA is classified as capacity development technical assistance category B.   \n  \n36.  The outputs of the TA will be annual reports and a final report prepared by independent \ntechnical advisors and the dissemination of lessons learned on the operation of the WTE plants \nand their applicability to other municipal governments in the PRC and DMCs through seminars \nand conferences, as well as through published reports.  \n \n2.  Cost and Financing \n37.  The TA is estimated to cost $705,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance $653,000 as a \ngrant through the Clean Energy Fund14 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nprogram.  \n \n3.  Implementation Arrangements \n38.  ADB,  as  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  TA,  will  be  responsible  for  all  technical \nimplementation issues, but with full support and cooperation from CEIL. The outputs will be \nmonitored by ADB through consultants' reports, and certain key documents will be reviewed by \nADB and CEIL for approval. ADB and CEIL will form a TA task force comprising representatives at \nappropriate levels from ADB and CEIL, as well as the consultants to be hired. The task force will \ncommunicate regularly to assess needs, monitor progress, and discuss relevant issues. The TA \nwill be implemented intermittently over 54 months from the date its services start. \n \n39.  Consulting  services  required  for  the  TA  include  17  person-months  of  international \nconsulting and 25 person-months of national. A consulting firm will be selected using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method with the simplified technical proposals. The recruitment of the \nfirm will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Disbursements under TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.15 \n \nC.  Justification \n40.  ADB\u2019s assistance for the Project is justified by its development impacts. It supports the \nGovernment\u2019s development plans and ADB\u2019s operational strategies, and ADB\u2019s participation will \nadd value to the Project in the following ways: \n(i)  The Project will provide access to clean, reliable, and safe MSW treatment to \npeople living in secondary cities where adequate WTE infrastructure is lacking \n                                                 \n14 Contributors are the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n15 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "  9 \nand demand is currently not fully met. It will support the Government's strategic \npriorities for the environment as set forth in the 11th Five Year Plan. The Project \nintroduces a new mechanism to efficiently address both MSW management and \nelectricity  supply,  which  will  help  to  raise  urban  living  standards,  arrest \nenvironmental degradation, and advance sustainable urban development. This \nwill particularly benefit the urban poor, who suffer severely from air and water \npollution.  \n(ii)  The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy for the PRC, which is based on \nfour development objectives, one of which is environmental improvement. The \nProject will embody ADB's Strategy 2020, which emphasizes more support in \nADB's lending portfolio for environmentally sustainable development and private \nsector  development.  The  Project  seeks  to  address  regional  and  global \nenvironmental impacts. By introducing clean technologies to utilize abundant \nMSW as fuel, the Project will address regional environmental problems and \nmitigate greenhouse gas emissions. \n(iii)  The Project will support a series of medium-sized WTE projects with clean \ntechnologies to be built through PPP. It will contribute to the introduction and \ntransfer  of  state-of-the-art  technologies  to  be  utilized  to  address  urban \nwaste-management problems, which is in line with ADB public sector efforts and \ncan be used by the Government as a model for other projects. TA will ensure \ninformation dissemination to municipal governments and policy makers.  \n(iv)  The  Project  has  pioneering  features  that  embody  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \noperations policy in the PRC. As a multi-project facility, the Project will enable \nADB to extend its reach to multiple municipal WTE projects that would be difficult \nto  assist  directly,  while  leveraging  the  experience  and  know-how  of  an \nexperienced developer. The ADB loan in US dollar is essential for a holding \ncompany to invest in US dollar as often required and will act as a leverage to \nmobilize local currency financing from local banks, which are unfamiliar with the \nclean technologies that the Project will employ.  \n \nD.  Anticorruption, Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n41.  CEIL and CEEEL were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and policy relating to the Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require CEIL and CEEEL and its subsidiaries to institute, maintain, and comply with \ninternal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the purpose of \npreventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant \nwith ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB, CEIL, and \nCEEEL  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these \nundertakings. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n42.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank16,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed loan. No funding \nwill be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation.  \n \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 1966. Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank.
