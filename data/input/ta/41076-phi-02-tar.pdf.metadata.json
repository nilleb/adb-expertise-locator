", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  Philippines  has  requested  capacity  development  technical \nassistance (TA) to strengthen transparency and accountability in the road subsector. During \n2009, Asian Development Bank (ADB) missions met with the Department of Public Works and \nHighways (DPWH) to discuss the TA and reach an agreement on its impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Governance has been recognized as a constraint to sustained economic growth and \npoverty reduction in the Philippines. The Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 2004\u2013\n2010  attributes  the  limited  effectiveness  of  public  management  to  the  influence  of  vested \ninterests  and  a  system  of  patronage  throughout  government.  The  Public  Expenditure  and \nFinancial Accountability report2 identifies weaknesses in various aspects of the Philippine public \nfinancial  management  system,  specifically  in  budget  execution  and  financial  management \nreporting. The system is fragmented, and oversight agencies include the Commission on Audit \n(COA), Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and Department of Finance. Important \nreforms  have  been  introduced  to  reduce  governance  risks.  According  to  the  country \nprocurement assessment report,3 since the passage of the Government Procurement Reform \nAct,4 the  public  procurement  system  has  become  more  efficient,  and  many  loopholes  for \ncorruption opportunities have been closed. The promotion of electronic procurement through the \nPhilippine  government  electronic  procurement  system  (PhilGEPS)  has  vastly  improved \ntransparency and efficiency.5 However, despite these reforms, the quality of governance in the \nPhilippines deteriorated gradually during the past decade. According to a World Bank report,6 \nthe control of corruption indicator ranks the Philippines lowest among countries in the region; \nand the country\u2019s ratings for all indicators, except rule of law and development effectiveness, \nhave deteriorated since 1998. Opportunities for civil society organizations to engage with the \nbureaucracy through formally established mechanisms remain limited.  \n \n3.  Governance issues are prevalent in the transport sector as well, due to the nature of the \ncivil  works,  which  are  usually  capital  intensive  and  difficult  to  inspect  and  evaluate  for \nreasonableness of costs; the size and structure of DPWH, which makes monitoring difficult; and \nthe vulnerability of the subsector's resources to vested interests. In previous years, DPWH was \nidentified as one of the top agencies in which corruption is perceived to be prevalent. A recent \nDPWH  corruption  case  involving  the  World  Bank-financed  Philippines  National  Roads \nImprovement and Management Program, phase 1, further damaged DPWH's reputation and \nresulted in DPWH and all major development partners placing increased emphasis on mitigating \ngovernance risks.7  The government, including DPWH, recognizes governance as a constraint \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 October 2009. \n2  World Bank. 2009.

Governance Matters VIII: Governance Indicators for 1996\u20132008. Washington, DC.   \n7  The  World  Bank  integrity  vice  presidency  investigation  uncovered  collusive  practices  involving  local  and \ninternational companies bidding on National Roads Improvement and Management Program, phase I contracts. \nSeven companies and one individual were debarred for engaging in collusive practices. \n ", "2   \nto  sustained  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  in  general,  and  development  of  the \ncountry's road infrastructure, in particular, as demonstrated in the Medium-Term Philippine \nDevelopment Plan 2004\u20132010 and the country procurement assessment report. DPWH has \ntaken a number of steps to assess and mitigate governance risks. It adopted an integrity \ndevelopment action plan in 2005, for which the code of conduct has recently been submitted.8 A \n2006 integrity development review9 resulted in the adoption of an action plan; DPWH reports \nprogress  with  the  action  plan  to  the  Office  of  the  Ombudsman.10 DPWH  also  prepared  a \nseparate  integrity  development  action  plan  comprising  22  predetermined  steps  to  improve \nprevention, education, deterrence, and critical partnerships.11 An integrity strengthening action \nplan12 was  prepared  for  the  World  Bank's  National  Roads  Improvement  and  Management \nProgram,  phase  2,  incorporating  a  comprehensive  range  of  measures  designed  to  build \ninstitutional  capacity  and  governance,  strengthen  fiduciary  controls  over  the  use  of  loan \nproceeds, and strengthen social accountability and demand for good governance from civil \nsociety.  \n   \n4.  In addition, DPWH is currently undertaking efforts to improve its organizational and \nnetwork capacity and to mitigate governance risks. These include (i) reforming procurement by \ndeveloping a computerized registry of contractors for eligibility screening and postqualification of \nbidders;  (ii)  instituting  value  engineering  to  ensure  the  most  cost-efficient  design;  \n(iii) establishing a cost estimation system; (iv) establishing a database management system \nconnecting the central, regional, and district offices; and (v) posting procurement information on \nthe DPWH website. DPWH is also making significant progress in strengthening its financial \nmanagement system, which operates in a decentralized financial management environment, \nand utilizes COA's electronic new government accounting system (e-NGAS) as its financial \nsystem.  DPWH  has  made  significant  progress  in  introducing  e-NGAS,  which  is  either \nimplemented or undergoing implementation in all 16 regional offices and about one third of \ndistrict offices. DPWH is also installing DBM's e-budget system in 17 offices, including all \nregional offices. The accuracy and reliability of current transactions has increased substantially \nin offices in which e-NGAS and e-budget are installed. However, the full benefit of the system \ncannot be realized until all DPWH offices are effectively utilizing it and e-NGAS and e-budget \nare  fully  harmonized.  DPWH  also  strongly  supports  implementation  of  DBM's  National \nGuidelines  on  Internal  Control  Systems,  and  developed  and  implemented  the  Financial \nManagement Policies and Procedures Manual in 2008.  \n \n5.  Civil society organizations (CSOs) are undertaking initiatives to combat corruption in the \nsubsector. Under the National Roads Improvement and Management Program, phase 2, the \nWorld Bank and Australian Agency for International Development are strengthening the role of \nCSOs in the transport sector, particularly Bantay Lansangan (Road Watch), to improve the \ndelivery of quality services in an efficient and corruption-free manner and to improve DPWH's \n                                                 \n8  Department of Public Works and Highways. 2005.

Corruption Resistance Review and \nCorruption Vulnerability Assessment. Manila. \n10  The integrity development review of critical government agencies is spearheaded by the Office of the Ombudsman \nand has been piloted in five agencies, including DPWH. The latest report was submitted to the Office of the \nOmbudsman in October 2007. \n11  The action plan follows Presidential Anti-Graft Commission requirements and quarterly reporting structures. It \nincludes the conduct of an integrity development review as one of the measures, but does not translate the findings \nof the review into an action plan. It includes institutionalization of an internal audit unit. \n12  The integrity strengthening action plan builds on combined actions taken from the integrity development review and \nthe integrity development action plan and some additional measures resulting from internal World Bank financial \nrules and procurement procedures. Many of these measures have been strengthened due to the incorporation of \nlessons from the investigation of the National Roads Improvement and Management Program, phase 1 by the \nWorld Bank\u2019s internal investigations unit, the Department of Institutional Integrity (INT).     \n ", "  3\nresponsiveness to the needs of road users. Bantay Lansangan is monitoring and analyzing \nsources and uses of public funds, implementation and delivery, and institutional performance. \n \n6.  The initiatives to address governance in the road subsector have strengthened financial \ncontrols and management and improved the efficiency of financial management processes and \nprocurement.  However, much remains to be done to improve governance in the subsector. \nCollusion in selection of firms and awarding of contracts continues to be a major problem. This \ncan be addressed by strengthening internal and external accountability mechanisms. \n \n7.  The government has requested ADB to resume an active role in supporting the roads \nsubsector.  ADB  plans  to  begin  this  re-engagement  with  the  subsector  by  addressing \ngovernance  issues.  The  proposed  TA  will  facilitate  ADB's  re-entry  into  the  subsector  by \naddressing  one  of  the  subsector's  core  issues  before  new  loan  support  is  provided.  The \nproposed  TA  is  expected  to  be  followed  by  other  ADB-financed  initiatives  to  address \ngovernance issues in the subsector, with future initiatives likely to focus on strengthening the \ncapacity of CSOs to use (i) value engineering to address overpricing by evaluating whether cost \nestimates  for  civil  works  contracts  are  reasonable,  and  (ii)  nondestructive  techniques  for \ninspection and evaluation of completed civil works. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be that economic growth and investment increase as a result of \nincreased  efficiency  in  the  road  subsector.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  increased \ntransparency and accountability of road subsector budgets and investments, including those \ncovered under planned ADB-financed road subsector activities.  \n \n9.  The TA will play a key role in mitigating corruption risks for planned ADB-financed road \nsubsector  activities  and  in  strengthening  governance  and  capacity  to  achieve  improved \ntransparency  and  accountability  in  the  road  subsector.  The  TA  will  build  on  the  ongoing \nactivities of the government, CSOs, and other development partners to improve subsector \ngovernance  by  combating  corruption  and  strengthening  institutional  capacity.  The  TA  will \ndeepen reforms in procurement, participatory auditing, and internal auditing; and will strengthen \norganizational and network capacities of the DPWH internal audit service, CSOs, and COA. The \nTA  supports  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  government's  Medium-Term  Philippine \nDevelopment Plan 2004\u20132010 which are relevant to the transport sector. The TA is consistent \nwith ADB's long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020), under which ADB will \nincrease support for good governance and the building of development capacities. The TA will \nsupport  ADB's  new  Philippines  Country  Partnership  Strategy,  which  will  likely  emphasize \naddressing inadequate infrastructure and governance concerns, which are critical development \nconstraints. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The outcome of the TA will be achieved through three outputs: mitigation of corruption \nrisks for planned ADB-financed road subsector activities, strengthened internal accountability \nmechanisms, and strengthened external accountability mechanisms.  \n11.  Output 1: Mitigation of procurement risks. Mitigation of corruption risks related to \nprocurement  for  planned  ADB-financed  road  subsector  activities  will  be  achieved  through \nsupport for a procurement advisory team. The team will be composed of international and \n ", "4   \nnational consultants and will participate as an observer in all stages of the procurement process \nfrom the preprocurement conference through contract award. The advisory team will review all \nprocurement documents, and report its assessment on the integrity of the process and its \ncompliance with ADB's procurement guidelines to ADB for use in ADB's procurement review \nand to the DPWH bids and awards committee. DPWH will provide the procurement advisory \nteam with all relevant documents and originals of all submissions received from bidders and \ncorrespondence related to procurement under planned ADB-financed road subsector activities. \nDPWH will retain full responsibility and accountability for conducting procurement of ADB-\nfinanced  activities  in  accordance  with  national  laws,  DPWH  procurement  guidelines, \nharmonized national procurement procedures, and ADB's procurement guidelines. The advisory \nteam will provide recommendations for and assistance to DPWH to strengthen its procurement \nprocess.  \n12.  Output 2: Strengthening internal accountability mechanisms. Internal accountability \nmechanisms within DPWH will be improved by strengthening internal audit capacity. This output \nwill build on the work conducted under the Australian Agency for International Development-\nfinanced Philippines\u2013Australia Economic Governance Reform Partnership's Internal Controls \nand Internal Audit Capacity in DPWH project, in particular the baseline assessment of the \ninternal control system, internal auditing, and the action plan to implement recommendations of \nthe assessment. The TA will strengthen critical capacities of internal auditing by providing \nadvisory support and on-the job training for (i) conducting the internal audit of planned ADB-\nfinanced  activities,  which  will  serve  as  on-the-job  training  for  DPWH  internal  auditors;  (ii) \nmonitoring and implementing COA audit report recommendations, and developing capacity in \nconducting risk-based internal audits; and (iii) profiling corruption cases for use in the training \nthe participatory audit team and the Internal Audit Unit. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Strengthening  external  accountability  mechanisms.  External \naccountability mechanisms, and organizational and network capacities of key stakeholders, \nincluding  CSOs  and  COA,  will  be  improved  through  support  for  participatory  audits  and \nmonitoring of public expenditures. The sustainability of this output will be addressed through a \nrequirement  for  the  government,  under  planned  ADB-financed  road  subsector  activities,  to \nfinance participatory audits following the initial financing provided under the TA. The TA will \nprovide  support  for  joint  COA\u2013CSO  participatory  audits  of  procurement  and  construction \nthrough community participation. A special feature will be the networking between CSOs and \noversight agencies. As a first step, an interagency agreement on mitigating governance risks in \nthe road subsector will be signed by oversight bodies, such as COA, DBM, DPWH, and a \nselected CSO. Cooperation with oversight agencies and DPWH will ensure access of the CSO \nto  technical  knowledge.  The  participatory  audit  team  will  conduct  independent  reviews  or \nrandom inspections during the preparation and implementation of works and services on topics \nincluding appropriateness of design; cost estimates, specifications, and procurement of works; \nquality  of  supervision  and  finished  works;  selection  of  consultants  and  performance  of \nconsultant services; and contract variations and amendments. A joint audit program will be \nprepared and carried out by the audit team and the CSO. DPWH will be informed in order to \navoid delays in project implementation. Reporting will be made to the joint oversight members, \nfinancial stakeholders, and DPWH. An audit report on planned ADB-financed road subsector \nactivities  will  be  produced  on  a  biannual  basis  by  the  participatory  audit  team  to  provide \ninformation on the status and performance of the road subsector.  \n \n14.  The TA will also provide support to a CSO specializing in expenditure tracking and \nbudget monitoring in the road subsector. The CSO will be supported in analyzing all funds \nallocated to DPWH, including from the General Appropriations Act allocation, the Road Users' \nTax, the Priority Development Assistance Fund, and official development assistance. DPWH \n ", "  5\nhas agreed to upload information on allocated funds on the DPWH website. The CSO will be \nsupported in analyzing the annual report on the utilization of the DPWH budget and funds \nreceived from all sources, including the Road Board, which DPWH has agreed to submit to ADB. \nThe TA will provide operating and advisory support for the newly established participatory audit \nand  expenditure  tracking  teams;  and  will  finance  the  conduct  of  training,  studies,  and \ndissemination of findings in close cooperation with DPWH. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The  TA  cost  is  estimated  at  $1.3  million  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  $1.0  million \nequivalent. The TA will be financed from ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013\nother sources). The government will finance the balance of $0.3 million equivalent by providing \noffice accommodation, remuneration, and per diem for counterpart staff, and other items, mostly \nin kind. The cost estimates and financing plan for the TA are shown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  DPWH will be the executing agency for the TA and the implementing agency for outputs \n2 and 3. ADB will be the implementing agency for output 1 (procurement advisory team).The \nDPWH project management office will coordinate the TA activities and communicate with ADB. \nSince  the  project  management  office  will  also  be  responsible  for  procurement  activities, \ncoordination with ADB for activities under TA output 1 will be straightforward. Disbursements \nunder the TA will be done in accordance with ADB's Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook13. The TA will be implemented from January 2010 to March 2012. \n \n17.  The TA will require a total input of 12 person-months of international and 24 person-\nmonths of national consultants, in addition to input from CSOs. For the procurement advisory \nteam under output 1, ADB will engage an experienced international procurement specialist and \nan experienced national procurement specialist for 9 person-months, each on an intermittent \nbasis. For strengthening internal audit (output 2), ADB will engage an experienced international \ninternal audit specialist for 3 person-months and a national consultant for 15 person-months on \nan intermittent basis. For the participatory audit (output 3), ADB will engage a national CSO \nnetwork with expertise in procurement, budget transparency and monitoring, and monitoring civil \nworks. CSOs from the network will be fielded to oversee the procurement process jointly with \nCOA representatives, monitor funding allocations and the budget for the road subsector, and \nmonitor civil works being implemented under planned ADB-financed subsector activities using \nnondestructive testing equipment. The national CSO network will be engaged using consultants\u2019 \nqualifications selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in the \nRoad Subsector, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2008.
