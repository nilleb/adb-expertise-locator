INTRODUCTION\n1. The Operations Evaluation Office (OEO) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has\nexpanded its role to evaluate, not only completed but also ongoing projects to provide more up-\nto-date feedback that is helpful both to ADB and its developing member countries (DMCs). OEO\nnow evaluates a broad range of ongoing and completed country and sector-specific projects,\nand other ADB operations. This change in mandate has  arisen from  the need  to  provide\ncomprehensive and timely feedback both to DMCs and ADB. OEO evaluations enhance the\nDMCs\u2019 and ADB\u2019s knowledge about the impact and effectiveness of ADB operations in recipient\ncountries. The special studies conducted under OEO\u2019s expanded role now account for about\n40 percent of total OEO evaluations.\n2. In 2000, OEO\u2019s technical assistance (TA) program of special evaluation studies covers\n10 studies, 5 of which were approved under part I of this regional technical assistance (RETA).1\nPart II2 of the RETA covers another five studies: (i) ADB assistance for rural credit in selected\nDMCs,  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  crisis  management  intervention  in  Indonesia,  (iii)  ADB  participation  in\ninvestment  funds,  (iv) privatization  of  public  sector  enterprises  (PSEs)  in  DMCs,  and\n(v) synthesis  of  ADB\u2019s  response  to  four  crisis-hit  Asian  countries.3  The  TA  framework  is\npresented in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. OEO has increasingly focused on thematic evaluations comprising impact evaluations of\nADB\u2019s lending to specific sectors, and special studies of ADB\u2019s processes and operations. This\nresults from a recommendation of the Task Force on Improving Project Quality (January 1994).\nWhile the evaluations are based on the results of individual projects, the thematic approach is\nexpected to widen the applicability of findings and provide strategic direction to sector work, and\nto country programming.\n4. In the evaluations OEO initiates, it must maintain its independent status in selecting and\nundertaking a broad range of studies. As a rule, studies with an immediate impact on ADB\u2019s\ninternal  operations\u2014such  as  project  or  program  performance  audit  reports  and  country\nassistance plan (CAP) evaluations for internal use\u2014may be funded as internal administrative\nexpenses, while studies addressing thematic or operational issues with direct benefits to DMCs\nas well as ADB are financed from RETA funds.4 Studies financed from RETA funds cost about\n$1.5 million in 1997 and the same in 1998. Acknowledging the operational relevance of this\nimportant activity, the ADB President in November 1998 approved the creation of an annual TA\nindicative planning figure for OEO to finance consultant inputs for certain studies. In 1999, six\nstudies were financed under an umbrella RETA.5\n                                               \n1 TA 5903-REG: Special Evaluation Studies of ADB Operations in Developing Member Countries-Part I, for\n$840,000, approved on 9 February 2000. The studies are (i) policy-based program lending in selected DMCs,\n(ii) assistance for agriculture and natural resources research, (iii) gender and development, (iv) sustainability of\npolicy reforms through advisory TAs, and (v) country assistance program evaluation for the Philippines.\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 28 January 2000.\n3 Individual logical frameworks will be included in the position papers for each of these studies (para. 20).\n4 Memo on the Use of Bank Resources: RETA vs. Administrative Budget, BPMSD, 28 February 2000.\n5 TA 5832-REG: Evaluation Studies in the Bank\u2019s DMCs, for $1 million, approved on 12 February 1999. The studies\nwere (i) impact evaluation study of ADB\u2019s assistance for technical and vocational education, (ii) impact evaluation\nstudy of ADB\u2019s assistance to key sectors in Nepal, (iii) special evaluation study of ADB\u2019s assistance for poverty\nreduction, (iv) special evaluation study on the role of nongovernment organizations in ADB-assisted projects,\n(v) special evaluation study on the role of resident missions in project implementation, and (vi) evaluation of the\nViet Nam CAP.", "2\n5. For 2000, $1.6 million has been approved to finance four impact evaluation studies, five\nspecial evaluation studies, and one country assistance program evaluation. ADB\u2019s programs\nand  projects  departments  proposed  over  40  studies,  from  which  10  were  selected  to  be\ncompleted in 2000. Four evaluation studies and one country assistance program evaluation are\ncovered under part I of OEO\u2019s 2000 TA program. Part II of this RETA covers the five new\nstudies.\n6. In  preparing  the  2000  work  program,  OEO  considered  ADB\u2019s  strategic  objectives,\npolicies, and operations. The impact evaluation study of ADB assistance for rural credit in\nselected DMCs will compare experience of ADB assistance in rural credit in the region. The\nseven DMCs selected for this study are Bangladesh, People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia,\nNepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. The  special evaluation study on  ADB's  crisis\nmanagement intervention in Indonesia will provide real-time feedback on ADB\u2019s contribution to\n(i) support financial governance reforms, (ii) strengthen social safety nets for poverty reduction\nand social protection, (iii) help implement the decentralization initiative of the Government, and\n(iv) address critical issues in the power sector. The impact evaluation study of ADB participation\nin  investment  funds  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  independent  internal  review  of  its  $245  million\ninvestments in funds that can be broadly classified as (i) international portfolio investment funds,\n(ii) venture capital funds, (iii) private equity funds, (iv) domestic mutual funds, and (v) debt\nfunds. The special study on the privatization of PSEs in DMCs will evaluate overall progress\ntoward privatization, its impact, and its integration into DMC programming plans. The study of\nADB\u2019s  responses  to  crises-stricken  Asian  countries  will  draw  conclusions  from  ADB\u2019s\nemergency assistance and crisis management in Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Philippines, and\nThailand. It will provide early feedback and overall insights on how ADB has coped with this\nchallenge.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n7. The TA will assess ADB operations and processes in the selected DMCs within the\ncontext of the four identified themes. The feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the\nprojects evaluated will help to strengthen ADB operations in the region.\nB.  Scope of Activities\n8. The TA comprises five independent studies that will be implemented separately and will\nbe supervised by five OEO staff. These studies will enable OEO to provide timely feedback on a\nbroad  range  of  operational  issues.  In  preparing  this  work  program,  OEO  continued  the\nestablished consultative process with the operational departments concerning the needs of\nDMCs. Preparatory work involved extensive direct contact and interaction with concerned ADB\nstaff, government counterparts, and project stakeholders and beneficiaries.\n9. Impact Evaluation Study of ADB Assistance for Rural Credit in Selected DMCs.\nBeginning with an agricultural credit loan to Nepal in 1970,6 ADB has financed numerous loan\nand TA projects in rural credit.7 ADB assistance has been extended both as stand-alone loans\nto exclusively rural credit projects and as subcomponents of larger projects that included rural\ncredit.  Most  of  this  assistance  has  been  provided  for  agricultural  and  natural  resources\n                                               \n6  Loan 59-NEP(SF): Agricultural Credit Project, for $2.4 million, approved on 23 December 1970.\n7  The term rural credit here is taken to include, but is not confined to, credit for agricultural purposes. Neither rural\ncredit nor agricultural credit is categorized as a subsector by ADB.", "3\ndevelopment. The objectives of such assistance have been to promote growth, reduce poverty,\nand enhance agricultural productivity. Most of the exclusively rural credit projects benefit the\nagricultural support services subsector. Thirty-eight of the 93 loans to the agricultural support\nservices subsector had been postevaluated by the end of 1999. Of the 38, 17 were exclusively\ncredit projects. One TA project on rural credit was postevaluated8 and one impact evaluation\nstudy  on  credit  in  Nepal  was  also  undertaken.9  However,  ADB  has  not  done  a  regional\nevaluation of the impact of its assistance to rural credit projects.\n10. The  primary  objective  of  this  study  is  to  review  and  assess  the  impact  of  ADB\u2019s\noperations in rural credit based on projects that have been completed. References to ongoing\nprojects will be made where necessary, data permitting. The study will cover seven DMCs from\ndifferent parts of Asia, with a significant number of completed rural credit projects, implemented\nunder a wide range of circumstances. The regional scope of the study will provide lessons\napplicable to a wide area of ADB intervention in rural credit.\n11. Special Evaluation Study of ADB's Crisis Management Intervention in Indonesia.\nThe  Asian  financial  crisis  in  1997  exposed  serious  structural  problems  in  the  Indonesian\neconomy, particularly the financial sector. To mitigate the adverse impacts of the crisis and\nprovide a basis for economic recovery, ADB adopted an interim country strategy to support\npolicy and institutional reforms. This strategy called for shifting the focus of ADB assistance\nfrom project to policy-based lending to help meet the costs of adjustments arising from policy\nand  structural  reforms.  In  1998  and  1999,  ADB  approved  five  policy-based  operations\namounting to $2.8 billion. The quick disbursing portion of these five projects amounted to\n$2.2 billion, of which $1.4 billion had been disbursed by early February 2000. The severity of the\ncrisis, and the speed and size of ADB's intervention call for real-time feedback. The study is\nintended to provide this feedback by assessing the relevance, efficacy, and interim impacts, in\nreal-time context, of ADB's crisis management intervention in Indonesia.\n12. The  main  purpose  of  the  study  is  to  evaluate  the  adequacy,  timeliness,  and\nappropriateness of the ADB response to the economic crisis in Indonesia and draw lessons\nfrom it. The study will analyze the five policy-based  operations financed by  ADB, provide\nfeedback on lessons learned, and recommend best practices. The evaluation will focus on the\nmanner in which ADB responded in Indonesia. It will assess the impact that ADB\u2019s lending\nprocedures had on its ability to respond quickly in a crisis. Specifically, the review will (i) assess\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of ADB's response; (ii) determine the impact of the lending\nprocess on the quality and content of the assistance program; and (iii) identify and discuss key\nissues, required follow-up action, and guidelines for future emergency interventions.\n13. Impact  Evaluation  Study  of  ADB  Participation  in  Investment  Funds.  ADB  has\ninvested in 29 funds from 1983 to 1999. The funds represent a total of $3.4 billion in investor\ncommitments, of which ADB\u2019s share is $245 million. A recent review conducted by ADB\u2019s\nPrivate Sector Group (PSG) concluded that (i) the overall financial performance of ADB\u2019s funds\nportfolio has been satisfactory, and (ii) the development impacts of the majority of these funds\nhave been positive. The review highlighted several lessons learned while introducing \u201cbest\npractice  principles\u201d that  may  guide  ADB\u2019s funds  investments  in  the  future.  The  study  will\nevaluate the ADB participation in funds from the investment and development viewpoints.\n                                               \n8  Technical Assistance Performance Audit Report (TE-15) on TA 1961-VIE: Development of Small-Scale Rural\nCredit Project, circulated in September 1996.\n9  Impact Evaluation Study (IE-7) on Bank Operations in the Agricultural Credit Subsector in Nepal, circulated in\nSeptember 1988.", "4\n14. The study aims to draw lessons from ADB participation in these funds and recommend\nfuture practices. The assessment will focus on (i) development impacts and achievements of\nspecific objectives, (ii) financial performance and risk profiles, and (iii) fund mobilization effects\nand ADB\u2019s catalytic role. After an initial review of all the funds, four will be identified for detailed\nassessment. Performance indicators for the initial reviews and selection criteria of funds for the\ndetailed assessments will be determined at an early stage of the study. The lessons learned\nand the \u201cbest practice principles\u201d identified in the recent PSG review will be used in assessing\nthe selected funds.\n15. Special Study on the Privatization of Public  Sector  Enterprises  in  DMCs.  The\nprivatization of PSEs has been a recurrent theme on the international development agenda\nsince  the  early  1980s,  although  largely  as  a  long-term  goal.10  As  a  consequence,  the\nprivatization  process  has  been  monitored  and  evaluated  largely  in  terms  of  increasing\nautonomy,  restructuring  toward  corporatization/commercialization,  deregulating  pricing,\nremoving  subsidies, and drawing  up  schedules for  public divestment.  There  has been  no\nevaluation of the following for ADB\u2019s DMCs: (i) the overall progress towards privatization, (ii) the\nimpact of privatization, (iii) the extent to which privatization is integrated into DMC programming\nplans, and (iv) lessons learned that could guide and spur on the privatization process.11 In\nrecognition of the need for a more concrete understanding of the privatization process, the study\nwill prepare a report on ways to design more effective projects. The results of the study will help\nto  review  ADB\u2019s  strategic  framework  for  development,  country  assistance  programming\nmissions, new project formulations, and evaluations of ongoing and completed programs and\nprojects.\n16. The scope of the study includes (i) reviewing the process, rationale, and economic\nbenefits of privatization;12 (ii) evaluating the extent to which privatization of PSEs is an integral\npart of DMC development plans and ADB\u2019s country strategies; (iii) analyzing results achieved\namong ADB\u2019s DMCs, including results from case studies; reviewing the lessons learned from\nexperience; and identifying the policy reforms and project design features necessary for the\neffective privatization of PSEs; and (iv) identifying and preparing guidelines on the enabling\nfactors associated with effective policy reforms.\n17. Study of ADB\u2019s Responses to Crises-Stricken Asian Countries. In response to the\n1997 Asian financial crisis, ADB provided emergency assistance to selected DMCs, including\nIndonesia,  Republic  of  Korea,  Philippines,  and  Thailand.  OEO,  in  1999,  evaluated  the\nappropriateness and interim impact of its crisis management intervention in Thailand and has\nincluded a similar assessment of the Indonesian experience in its work program for 2000. While\nADB has gained ample experience in the formulation of policy reform programs, the response to\nlarge-scale economic crisis was a challenge first posed to ADB in 1997. The analysis will focus\non ADB\u2019s lending processes and procedures and on its ability to respond quickly and effectively\nto a crisis. To the extent that these processes have affected the substance of ADB's responses,\n                                               \n10 The primary objective of ADB support to PSEs has been to meet expansion requirements and improve operational\nperformance.\n11 The process of privatization is considered to be any action that diminishes public ownership and control. In a\nbroader, more generally accepted context, privatization also involves any action that increases participation in\nmarket-driven activities. ADB\u2019s loan and advisory TA has been extensive, although uneven, across DMCs. Many of\nthe enabling reforms have been effected in collaboration with other international development agencies together\nwith advisory TA.\n12 This aspect has considerable practical application for understanding the scope of privatization, justification for\nprivatization, and the reasons for the different privatization methods followed. Within these categories, it includes\nenlightening understanding of issues relating to regulatory reform, corporate governance, foreign investment\n(including the implications for pricing with variable exchange rates), subvert forms of privatization, change, and\nproject management.", "5\nthe  responses  themselves  will  be  reviewed.  The  long-term  impact  of  ADB's  emergency\ninterventions in terms of their relevance, efficacy, and sustainability may be examined at a later\nstage.\n18. The  main  purpose  of  the  study  is  to  evaluate  ADB's  regional  experience  in  crisis\nmanagement and recommend guidelines for similar emergency interventions in the future. The\nstudy will cover four countries\u2014Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Philippines, and Thailand\u2014all\naffected by the Asian financial crisis. The analysis will draw on completed projects in the\nRepublic of Korea and Thailand, and other OEO studies in Indonesia and the Philippines.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n19. The total cost of the TA is expected to be $760,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed\nby ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program. Cost estimates are in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n20. OEO will implement the RETA. An OEO staff member will carry out each of the five\nevaluation studies with the assistance of international and domestic consultants. OEO staff\nmembers will devote a total of 28 person-months to the RETA. The RETA will also require\n20.2 person-months of international and 24.5 person-months of domestic consultant inputs. The\nrequired  areas  of  expertise,  duration  of  engagement  of  consultants,  and  outline  terms  of\nreference are in Appendix 3. Seminars and workshops will be conducted to present results and\nfindings of some studies, as well as to elicit feedback. In keeping with OEO\u2019s guidelines for\npreparing evaluation reports, each OEO staff member responsible for a study will prepare a\nposition paper13 prior to engaging consultants and embarking on evaluation missions. Individual\nevaluation reports will be prepared for each study. Consultants will be engaged by ADB in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  TA  is  planned  to\ncommence in May 2000 and is to be completed by the end of 2000.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n21. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$760,000 for Year 2000 Special Evaluation Studies of Asian Development Bank Operations in\nDeveloping Member Countries\u2014Part II, and hereby reports such action to the Board.\n                                               \n13The position papers will be prepared based on reviews of relevant project files and discussions with project\nofficers. They will present the backgrounds, objectives, scopes, and activities for the evaluations, along with\ntimetables for field missions, engaging consultants, and finalizing the reports.
