INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  (ADB\u2019s) country strategy and program (CSP) for Pakistan focuses on poverty \nreduction and highlights support for governance reforms that will help reduce poverty. In this \nframework, attention is given to policy and institutional reforms at the provincial level, including \npublic resource management. The proposed Punjab Resource Management Program (PRMP) \nloan, which will be processed in 2003, will initiate ADB\u2019s involvement in holistic province reforms \nin Pakistan. The program incorporates reforms in development planning, fiscal and financial \nmanagement, and public service delivery. \n \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper was  approved by the Federal \nGovernment in November 2001. The full national level Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper \n(PRSP) to be completed in early 2003 will be closely linked with the provincial poverty reduction \nstrategy  papers  (P-PRSPs).  Punjab  Government  (PG)  has  started  drafting  a  P-PRSP  in \nconsultation with the federal PRSP secretariat, civil society, and district governments. However, \nthe completion and subsequent implementation of the P-PRSP and the reform effort supported \nby PRMP will present new challenges to the staff and elected leadership of the PG. To enhance \nits existing resources and build new capacities, PG has requested a technical assistance (TA) \ngrant from the ADB to assist in completing and implementing the P-PRSP and the PRMP. The \nTA is included in ADB\u2019s 2002 program1 and is consistent with ADB\u2019s CSP for Pakistan. The TA \nwas designed during the Fact-Finding Mission2 fielded on 15-19 July 2002, and understanding \nwas reached with PG on the objectives, scope, effectiveness measures, and implementation \narrangements.3 The TA framework is attached as Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Rise  in  Poverty.  Income  poverty  in  Punjab  increased  significantly  from  25.2%  in \nFY1991 to 33% in FY1999. Poverty in the rural areas in FY1999 was estimated at 36%, and that \nin the urban areas was 25.5%. Together with income poverty, most key social development \nindicators in Punjab have also displayed a disappointing trend. For example, the primary school \ngross enrollment rate declined from 80% in FY1991 to 75% in FY1999.  \n \n4.  Lack of Clarity in Development Objectives.  Development planning in Punjab has lost \nmuch of its efficacy.  As a result, Punjab lacks a coherent and focused strategy for poverty \nreduction  and  socioeconomic  development.  Development  priorities  in  the  province  are \ninadequately informed by public consultation or engagement with elected leaders at local and \nprovince levels.  Commitments are made incrementally on the basis of individual investment, \nrather than in the wider frame of medium-term priorities and poverty goals and a robustly \ndetermined estimation of corresponding resource availability \n \n5.  Inadequate Fiscal and Financial Management. A direct result of weak development \nplanning is the inadequate level of resources for poverty-focused development expenditures.  \nEqually, if not more, problematic is that available resources are not efficiently utilized because of \nweak public sector fiscal and financial management. Fiscal management is severely constrained \nby inflexible expenditure and revenue policies and procedures, which do not allow the provincial \ngovernment to undertake/generate necessary investment needed to stimulate economic growth.  \nSalaries absorb the bulk of current expenditures. Complicated procedures encourage rent \n                                                 \n1  The TA was originally titled Enhancing Capacity for Resource Management and Institutional Reforms in Punjab. \n2  The Mission comprised N. Hamid, Senior Economic Advisor, PRM and S. Aftab, Project Specialist \u2013 Social Sectors, \nPRM.  ADB consultant S. H. Kardar also joined the Mission. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in September 2002.  ", "2 \nseeking and prevent the timely release of allocations to service delivery sites.  The poor quality \nof monitoring, reporting, and accountability systems has compromised the quality of public \nresource management. Provincial accounts are not fully reliable, and timely reconciliation of \naccounts is lacking.   \n \n6.  Public Service Delivery and Changing Role of Provincial Government. Punjab's \npublic administration is overstaffed, underpaid, and generally operating below potential. In \naddition, devolution has far-reaching implications for the structure and role of the provincial \ngovernment. With responsibility for the delivery of most social and productive services now \nassigned to local governments, the province must restructure itself and adopt new systems \nconsistent with its new responsibilities to make policy, and to support, supervise, and monitor \nthe performance of agencies with which it has no direct command-and-control relationship.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The TA will promote poverty-focused development planning and effective use of public \nresources in Punjab for poverty reduction, human development, and economic growth. To this \nend, the TA will support completion and implementation of the P-PRSP, and poverty reduction \naction plans at the district level. The TA will also assist in developing needed systems and \nmodalities  for  enhanced  effectiveness  of  public  expenditures  and  increased  resource \nmobilization. Finally, the TA will engender broad-based ownership of the poverty reduction \nstrategy and reform process in the political and administrative organs of the province and local \ngovernments, and within civil society and other stakeholders, while at the same time enhancing \nthe capacity to enable PG to undertake key activities necessary for developing the strategy and \nimplementing the reform program.   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will fund domestic as well as international experts on needs basis, workshops \nand forums to promote the participation of civil society and other stakeholders, and studies and \nsurveys. The TA will have two interrelated components. The first will focus on promoting \npoverty-focused  and  effective  development  planning  in  Punjab  with  the  aim  to  develop  a \nprovincial poverty strategy and district-based poverty action plans. The second component will \nassist in translating the poverty reduction strategy and action plans into a medium-term budget \nand expenditure plan to ensure that the resource needs identified by the poverty strategy are \nprioritized and met on an ongoing basis. This component will also enhance the effectiveness of \ndevelopment and poverty-related spending by supporting improvements in fiscal and financial \nmanagement.       \n1.  Effective, Poverty-Focused Development Planning \n9.  The TA will assist PG in developing a medium-term poverty reduction strategy, along \nwith specific targets and key performance indicators (KPIs). The TA will support these activities:  \n \n(i)  Complete and implement the P-PRSP,4 which will provide a comprehensive \nframework for social development and poverty reduction, and will be based on an \nextensive consultative process. \n                                                 \n4 PG has initiated work on preparing the P-PRSP, which will be supported by the Government of the United \nKingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) prior to the effectiveness of the TA. ", "    3 \n(ii)  Initiate the process of poverty-focused planning at the district level by providing \nintellectual and logistic support, and organizing subregional (i.e., between groups \nof districts) workshops and consultations with government officials and elected \nrepresentatives at the district level, while building synergies with the district \nplanning work planned under the Decentralization Support Program (DSP). \n(iii)  Facilitate the preparation of district poverty assessments, along with action plans \nfor reducing poverty and benchmarks for assessing performance in selected \ndistricts5. \n(iv)  Establish linkages between development planning and the budgetary processes \nto permit the preparation of an effective, rolling, poverty-focused medium-term \ndevelopment program within the available resources. \n(v)  Promote the participation of major stakeholders and civil society institutions in the \nreform and development process through provincial and subregional workshops \non  poverty  and  development  issues,  preparation  of  user-friendly  reports  on \neconomic  and  social  indicators,  and  information  dissemination  through  the \nInternet. \n(vi)  Upgrade  and  expand  existing  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  to  more \neffectively track progress in implementing the P-PRSP, and the implementation \nand outcomes of investment projects, establish the framework for a regular \nreporting system for user-friendly province- and district-specific economic and \nsocial indicators.  \n2.  Effective Resource Management \na.  Fiscal and Financial Management \n10.  The TA will assist PG in developing and implementing a poverty-focused medium-term \nfiscal  restructuring  plan  and  a  program  for  improving  financial  management.  The  specific \nactivities follow: \n \n \n(i)  Develop a medium-term budgetary framework (MTBF), as well as build capacity \nto  ensure  that  the  exercise  becomes  sustainable  and  is  carried  out  on  an \nongoing basis. \n(ii)  Develop  instruments,  measures,  and  procedures  for  improved  resource \nmobilization and institutional arrangements for efficient tax collection. \n(iii)  Strengthen the reliability and accuracy of provincial accounts and the reporting \nsystems involving timely reconciliation of accounts. \n(iv)  Undertake a comprehensive exercise to determine the actual and contingent \nliabilities of the provincial government (such as pensions).  \n(v)  Enhance transparency and accountability by including in the budget documents \n  information  to  facilitate  informed  assessment  of  the  financial  status  of  the \n  provincial government, and posting quarterly fiscal accounts on the Internet.\n \n(vi)  Build capacity at the provincial and local levels for PG\u2019s eventual take over of \naccounting  functions.  The  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  is  already \nproviding support to the office of the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) at the \nfederal level in the area of financial management, one component of which is to \nsupport  the  CGA\u2019s  work  to  enable  the  provinces  to  take  over  accounting \nfunctions by 2006. \n                                                 \n5  The selection of districts that will have support for undertaking poverty assessments and preparing action plans will \nbe based on evidence of sufficient ownership of this process within a particular district, its existing technical and \nmanagement capacity, and its level of poverty.  ", "4 \nb.  Improved Public Service Delivery \n11.  The TA will assist PG developing modalities and instruments for meeting P-PRSP goals \nin the changed environment where responsibility for social service delivery has been devolved \nto local governments, and in improving the management of its human resources. The activities \nwill include the following: \n \n(i)  Work  closely  with  institutions  nominated  by  PG  to  provide  the  necessary \ninformation and analysis to the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) so that its \nfinance  award  for  district  governments  incorporates  incentives  for  poverty-\nfocused social sector expenditures at the district level. \n(ii)  Evaluate the impact of ongoing innovative schemes in education and health, and \npromote the use of third-party validation of outcomes. \n(iii)  Streamline  procedures  for  timely  release  of  funds  for  recurrent,  nonsalary \nexpenditures. \n(iv)  Conduct a comprehensive civil service census to develop a human resource \ndatabase, a functional review of provincial departments, and an assessment of \ntraining requirements for critical jobs.   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000 equivalent, comprising foreign exchange costs of \n$193,000 and local currency cost of $657,000 equivalent.  ADB will provide $680,000 to finance \nthe entire foreign exchange costs, and $487,000 of the local currency costs on a grant basis \nfrom ADB\u2019s TA funding program, through the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund (PRCF), and \nby the Government of the United Kingdom. The estimated cost of component 1 is $300,000 \nequivalent, of which $33,000 will be the foreign exchange costs and $267,000 equivalent the \nlocal currency costs. An amount equivalent to $230,000 will be provided from the PRCF to \nfinance the entire foreign exchange costs, and $197,000 equivalent of local currency costs of \nthe component, while PG will contribute the remaining local currency cost of $70,000 equivalent \nin kind by providing office accommodation, counterpart staff support, and facilities for seminars \nand meetings.     \n \n13.  The estimated cost of component 2 is $550,000 equivalent, comprising foreign exchange \ncosts of $160,000 and local currency costs of $390,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $250,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from its TA funding program, and the Government of the United \nKingdom will finance $200,000 equivalent on a grant basis, administered by ADB, to finance the \nentire  foreign  exchange  costs,  and  $290,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs.  PG  will \ncontribute the remaining local currency cost of $100,000 equivalent in kind by providing office \naccommodation, counterpart staff support, and facilities for seminars and meetings.  Appendix 2 \nsummarizes the cost estimates. Appendix 3 presents component 1 using the PRCF budget \nframework. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The executing agency (EA) for the TA will be the Punjab Planning and Development \nBoard (P&D).  Implementing Agencies (IAs) to be supported by the TA will include P&D, and the \ndepartments of finance, excise and taxation, and management and professional development. \nEach IA will set up a core team, which, together with the consultants for the TA, will be \nresponsible for undertaking the key activities agreed upon for their particular area. The EA will ", "    5 \nestablish a project management unit (PMU)6, and will appoint a senior official to act as TA \ndirector and as Director of PMU. The PMU will have a core staff of 2 persons, assisted by \nconsultants recruited for the TA. \n \n15.  A project coordinator, who will be domestic consultant, will be responsible overall for the \nTA. Under the project coordinator, two teams of consultants will be appointed, one for each \ncomponent.  Each team will have a team leader. Consultants will report in the first instance to \ntheir respective team leader who will be responsible for the quality of their activities. The PMU \ndirector will be responsible for overall day-to-day supervision in consultation with the project \ncoordinator and the two team leaders. The deployment of international consulting resources (6 \nperson-months) will be identified during TA inception and finalized no later than 3 months of the \neffectiveness of the TA.  A steering committee chaired by the Chairman of P&D and consisting \nof representatives of the concerned provincial departments, will provide overall guidance and \ncoordination.   \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from December 2002 to May 2004.  A total \nof 135 person-months (6 for international and 129 for domestic consultants) will be required to \nimplement the TA (Appendix 4).    \n \n17.  The  project  coordinator  and  the  two  international  consultants  will  be  engaged \nindividually.  Two domestic consulting firms, with the required diversity of experience, will be \nengaged, one for each component. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the quality and cost-based selection method with \nsimplified technical proposals, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Ownership of all \nmaterials and equipment purchased by the consultants (in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \nfor Procurement) out of ADB funds for the purpose of the TA will be transferred to the EA on \ncompletion of the TA. \n \n18.  An inception mission will be fielded within 4 weeks from initiation of the TA to finalize the \nterms of reference for the consultants as well as their work assignments. The consultants will be \nrequired to submit quarterly progress reports. Quarterly tripartite meetings of the EA and the \nsteering committee, consultants engaged under the TA, and ADB will review implementation \nprogress. In addition, a midterm review will assess project progress and overall achievement will \nbe assessed at TA completion. The performance of the consultants will be evaluated through \nADB\u2019s specified consultant evaluation processes.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $230,000 to \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund; (ii) ADB administering \na portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of United Kingdom; and (iii) the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis; all to the Government of Pakistan for \nEnhancing Capacity for Resource Management and Poverty Reduction in Punjab, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n6  A PMU to support the DSP is already planned to be established in the Department of Finance.  In this regard, close \ncoordination and interaction between the PMU for DSP and the PMU for the present TA will be ensured for \nsynergistic functioning and operations.
