THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $300 million equivalent in dollars and yuan without government guarantee to Sound \nGlobal Ltd. and Beijing Sound Environmental Engineering Co., Ltd. (BSEE), comprising (i) a \nproposed A-loan of up to $100 million equivalent in dollars and yuan, and (ii) a proposed \ncomplementary loan1 of up to $200 million equivalent in dollars and yuan for the Rural Smart \nWastewater Treatment Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Pollution exacerbates water scarcity in the PRC. The enormous volume of wastewater \ngenerated  by  rural  areas\u2014home  to  a  half  of  the  country\u2019s  population\u2014poses  a  major \nenvironmental threat to the country\u2019s rivers, lakes, and underground aquifers. The responsibility \nfor wastewater management falls on local governments outside of major city areas. However, \nwastewater treatment facilities and sewage pipelines are scarce. Among the limited pipeline \nnetworks,  most  have  a  combined  sewer  system,  where  storm  water  and  wastewater  are \ncollected in a single pipe system, allowing untreated wastewater to escape into the environment \nwith the storm water. In rural areas, less than 20% of wastewater was treated; the rest was \ndischarged untreated into rivers and the lakes.3 Furthermore, only 10% of rural wastewater \ntreatment projects were properly maintained.4 With most untreated wastewater flowing directly \ninto the local surface water, the quality of local water sources has greatly deteriorated, often \nexceeding water quality limits specific to the source\u2019s water body.5 In 2012, 31% of 10 major \nriver systems and 39% of 62 primary lakes could not meet the water quality requirement for \ndrinking water. The quality of as much as 57% of total national groundwater is classified \u201cbad\u201d or \n\u201cvery  bad.\u201d6 This  pollution  in  upstream  areas  can  have  a great  sanitation  impact  on  local \npopulations who depend on these local water sources for their water supply; this problem is \nexacerbated in rural areas where drinking water treatment is inadequate or nonexistent. \n \n3.  Along  the  spectrum  of  wastewater  treatment  systems,  the  decentralized  wetland \napproach relying on natural purification has been most widely implemented. It is mechanically \nsimple, yet biologically complex. However, this treatment method often cannot meet the central \ngovernment\u2019s higher discharge standards.7 As constructed wetlands are open-air, the facilities \nare vulnerable to adverse weather, secondary contamination, and local sanitation problems. \nThe long-term efficiency and stability of purifying ever-increasing wastewater is uncertain. \n                                                \n1  Complementary loan is an ADB syndicated loan funded by commercial banks, where ADB is the lender of record.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, State Council. 2012.

To  address  this  challenge,  the  central  government  set  a  target  to  increase  the \nwastewater  treatment  rate  in  townships  to  30%  by  2015.8 Furthermore,  the  government \nreemphasized the importance of integrated urban and rural development through the Central \nCommittee Resolution: Concerning Some Major Issues in Comprehensively Deepening Reform. \nThis shift is expected to yield high environmental benefits but will require significant investment \nin wastewater plants and sewage networks. As for technology selection, conventional large-\nscale wastewater treatment systems in urban areas typically employ oxidation ditch, sequencing \nbatch reactor, and anaerobic\u2013anoxic\u2013oxic, with a fast-growing trend for membrane biological \nreactors. Those approaches require high up-front capital expenditure and a number of highly \nskilled operations staff on site to constantly adjust oxygen, chemical, and retention time. The \nlocal utilities owned by local governments have limited financing, technology, and operating \nknow-how for rural wastewater treatment. A cost-effective and flexible technical solution that \ncan adapt to the characteristics of rural areas is urgently needed. \n \n5.  Water management, including drinking water and wastewater treatment, has been a \nfocus area for Asian Development Bank (ADB) operations in the PRC since 1992. ADB\u2019s long-\nterm support for broad-based policy and regulatory reforms has played a critical role in enabling \nprivate sector participation (e.g., lifting tariffs to reach cost recovery, strengthening technical \nstandards). ADB has been taking a lead in supporting private sector participation in the water \nsector since the government requested ADB support for the first water sector public\u2013private \npartnership (PPP) project and the national water tariff guidelines encouraging cost recovery.9 \nRecently ADB has helped various provincial and city governments in the Songhua River Basin \nto develop pollution control strategies via the use of technical assistance projects to develop a \nlong-term road map for PPP, and to fund projects using sovereign and nonsovereign modalities \nto achieve higher environmental performance.10 \n \n6.  Through continuous project screening and discussion with stakeholders, ADB identified \nSound Global Ltd., an integrated water services provider, as having an innovative business \nmodel and proprietary technology to address rural wastewater management. The proposed \nproject is timely and builds on the achievements of earlier projects that addressed wastewater \ntreatment and reuse in cities.11 The project represents the first opportunity for ADB to provide \ndirect assistance focusing on rural wastewater management. \n \n                                                \n8  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, State Council. 2012.

The  project  will  support  Sound  Global  Ltd.  to  build  and  operate  a  series  of  small \nwastewater treatment plants and build the associated sewage trunk pipelines across the PRC. \nThe  project  involves  the  design,  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  multiple \nwastewater treatment subprojects using the small multiple modular automatic rapid technologies \n(SMART) solution with capacity of up to 240,000 tons/day and construction of the associated \ntrunk sewage pipeline networks by 2017. ADB\u2019s loans will be channeled to subprojects through \nSound Global Ltd. and BSEE, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sound Global Ltd. \n \n8.  Each subproject will have a mother plant that controls multiple daughter plants, which do \nnot  require  control  rooms  for  operations.  The  concession  agreement  between  the  project \ncompany and a county or municipal government will cover both types of plants, which is in line \nwith  the  PRC\u2019s  urban\u2013rural  integration  policies,  under  which  a  municipality\u2019s  regulatory \njurisdiction covers both the county center and surrounding villages and communities.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n3.  The Sponsor and the Borrowers \n9.  The project sponsor and borrower, Sound Global Ltd., is a private company established \nin 1993 in Beijing and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The major shareholders \ninclude Yibo Wen, the founder and chairman (50.2%),12 Schroders PLC (7.4%), International \nFinance Corporation (7.3%), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (6.0%).13 Sound Global Ltd. reported \npretax  profit  of  CNY566  million  ($91  million),  total  assets  of  CNY8.8  billion  \n($1.4 billion) with gearing of 55% in fiscal year (FY) 2013. BSEE, the second borrower, is \nincorporated in the PRC as an onshore platform fully owned by Sound Global Ltd. to develop \nwastewater treatment-related business and hold wastewater treatment project companies.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n10.  Sound  Global  Ltd.\u2019s  core  value  is  integrated  water  environment  management.  The \nbusiness lines cover engineering, procurement, construction, operation, and maintenance of \nwater and wastewater treatment facilities; and the manufacturing of water and wastewater \ntreatment  equipment.  In  2013,  Sound  Global  Ltd.  operated  a  portfolio  of  25  municipal \nwastewater treatment projects with a combined treatment capacity of 1.2 million tons/day and \ntwo rural wastewater treatment projects with a combined treatment capacity of 42,400 tons/day \nunder build\u2013operate\u2013transfer (BOT) arrangements. It also provided operation and maintenance \nservices to 19 projects with an aggregate treatment capacity of 310,000 tons/day. \n \n11.  Sound  Global  Ltd.  differentiates  itself  from  its  peers  by  adding  a  focus  on  rural \nwastewater  treatment.  Since  2005,  Sound  Global  Ltd.  has  been  developing  an  innovative \n                                                \n12 Yibo Wen owns his shares through Sound Water (BVI) Limited, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, a \ncompany jointly owned by Yibo Wen and his wife. The Global Forum for Transparency and Exchange of \nInformation for Tax Purposes recently rated British Virgin Islands as a \u201cnoncompliant\u201d jurisdiction. The project team \nhas referred this significant integrity issue to ADB PSOD Operations Coordination Division (PSOC), Office of \nAnticorruption and Integrity, and Office of the General Counsel and conducted detailed due diligence to satisfy ADB \nthat there are valid business and commercial reasons for the use of such an intermediate jurisdiction. \n13 Schroders PLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. hold shares of Sound Global Ltd. as nominee shareholders on behalf \nof individual investors. ", "4 \nbusiness model and technology for rural wastewater management based on international best \npractice. Building on the rotating biological contactor (RBC) technology mainly used in Europe \nand the United States for industrial wastewater treatment, Sound Global Ltd. developed SMART \ntechnology. The RBC is being used for an integrated rural wastewater treatment process for the \nfirst  time  worldwide.  The  PRC  National  Intellectual  Property  Bureau  awarded  SMART  six \npatents for its various components. The SMART solution is a small-scale wastewater treatment \nsystem  with  several  distinguishing  features  suited  for  rural  wastewater  treatment:  (i)  an \nautomated system requiring a minimum of on-site operations staff; (ii) a centralized control \nsystem  integrating  multiple  small  plants  and  improving  operating  efficiency  and  monitoring \neffectiveness;  and  (iii)  small-scale  standardized  modular  equipment  (capacity  of  300\u2013500 \ntons/day for each module); additional units can be installed to cope with increased wastewater \nresulting from future expansion. \n \n12.  Each SMART module comprises a multipurpose pretreatment tank for primary treatment, \na high-efficiency RBC for secondary treatment, and a double filtration tank for tertiary treatment. \nAfter the pretreatment process with the multipurpose treatment tank, the wastewater will be \nlifted to the high-efficiency RBC for the removal of organic pollutants, ammonia nitrogen, total \nnitrogen, and total phosphorus. A series of closely packed discs are mounted on a rotating \nshaft, supported just above the surface of the wastewater (i.e., around 40%\u201345% of the disc \nmedia are constantly being submerged in the wastewater and the rest are exposed to the air). \nThe rotational motion provides a chain of reactions that involve oxidation, adsorption, and \ndecomposition of organic pollutants presented in the incoming wastewater. Then the double \nfiltration tank removes the remaining suspended solids, lowering the total phosphorus before \neffluent discharge. The double filtration tank comprises a filtration tank and a rotating microfilter \nmade up of microfiber cloths capable of filtering fine particles through different pore sizes. Each \nunit of the SMART module can be designed for the specific treatment needs at each wastewater \ntreatment plant. The  local  environmental  protection  bureaus  will  monitor  the quality  of the \ntreated wastewater using a continuous emission monitoring system. \n  \n13.  Sound  Global  Ltd.  is  responsible  for  identifying,  evaluating,  selecting,  negotiating, \nimplementing, and administering the project companies.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n14.  The project impact includes enhanced environment and mitigated pollution in the PRC\u2019s \nrural  areas,  particularly  in  townships  currently  without  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  The \nproject is expected to be an important catalyst for private sector participation in wastewater \nmanagement, and thereby expedite the achievement of government targets and reduce threats \nto public health. By establishing better sanitation management, the project will contribute to \nMillennium  Development  Goal  7.14 The  outcome  is  improved  private  sector  wastewater \nmanagement in rural areas. The outputs include the installation of rural wastewater treatment \nfacilities with capacity of up to 240,000 tons/day and associated trunk sewage pipeline networks \nthat comply with ADB safeguard standards and technical and financial eligibility criteria. The \nproject helps the local economy and community by providing employment and through the local \npurchase of goods and services. \n                                                \n14 Millennium Development Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability (Indicator: Proportion of population with \naccess to improved sanitation, urban and rural (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\u2013World Health Organization). ", "5 \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 \n15.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which identifies \ninfrastructure  and  environment  as  two  of  the  four  strategic  priorities  to  sharpen  ADB\u2019s \noperational focus.15 Regarding  infrastructure,  the  project  is  in  line  with  Midterm  Review  of \nStrategy 2020\u2019s focus on inclusive growth, as well as with its emphasis on PPP. Regarding the \nenvironment,  the  project  mitigates  water  pollution  and  health  threats,  and  promotes \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. \n \n2.  Consistency with Country Strategy \n16.  By  supporting  inclusive  growth  and  environmental  sustainability,  the  project  directly \naddresses two of the three development goals of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u2013\n2015 for the PRC and aligns with the strategy\u2019s sector priority of rural environment protection, \nwater management, and pollution control.16 It strongly complements current ADB initiatives in \nwastewater treatment and water pollution control in urban areas. \n \n3.  Consistency with Sector Strategy \n17.  The project aligns with ADB\u2019s Water Policy, which recognizes the crucial importance of \nwater to the rural poor and the critical impacts of water scarcity, pollution, and degradation of \nwatersheds;  and  highlights  the  importance  of water  resource  management.17 ADB\u2019s Water \nOperational Plan, 2011\u20132020 identifies the need for concerted efforts to seek innovative ways to \ninvolve the private sector in rural water management.18  \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n18.  Sound  Global  Ltd.\u2019s  investment  plan  indicates  a  total  investment  of  $400  million \nequivalent, including civil works, equipment and materials, and other local procurement in rural \nareas for FY2015\u2013FY2017. \n \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2014.

Table 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements.19 \n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  Each subproject will enter into concession agreements with city or county \ngovernments for a mother plant and a cluster of daughter plants in the \nsurrounding townships and villages under build\u2013operate\u2013transfer arrangements. \nEach plant will be implemented in accordance with granted approvals, and \nduring construction and operation will be subject to government inspections on \nvarious aspects, including environment, safety, quality, and sanitation. Influent \nand effluent will be metered with minimum offtake quantities in all the plants. \nWastewater tariffs will be governed by the cost\u2013plus regulations set by the \ncentral government and paid by the city or county governments based on the \nconcession agreements. Sound Global Ltd. will construct the trunk sewage \npipeline networks to link the plants based on a build\u2013transfer arrangement.  \nManagement  Sound Global Ltd. will centrally control all project development, procurement, \nand financing arrangements across its operations. Sound Global Ltd. will assign \na seconded experienced general manager to the each plant. Cash is centrally \nmanaged through the cash management system. \nImplementation period  January 2015\u2013December 2017 \nConstruction  SMART application will be sourced by Sound Global Ltd. Other goods and \narrangement  services will be procured from Asian Development Bank members in a \ntransparent manner. Sound Global Ltd. will centrally manage engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contracts with subcontractors. \nOperation arrangements \nRevenue structure  Build\u2013operate\u2013transfer plants generate construction revenue, operating income, \nand interest income. Trunk sewage pipelines under build\u2013transfer contracts \ncontribute construction revenue. \nMajor cost structure  The major operating costs comprise electricity, chemicals, and payroll and \nmaintenance expense. \nOperation and  Daughter plants do not need skilled staff on site for operations. Seconded staff \nmaintenance  from Sound Global Ltd. will handle most operation and maintenance work of the \nmother plant with support from locally recruited staff. \nPerformance  The mother plant will monitor each daughter plant. Sound Global Ltd. will report \nmonitoring  data on key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, \nand compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \nSMART = small multiple modular automatic rapid technologies. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n20.  Initial financial projections indicate the project would yield a minimum financial internal \nrate of return is higher than the weighted average cost of capital. The project is economically \nviable as the economic internal rate of return is higher than the social discount rate of 12%. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n                                                \n19 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "7 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n21.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance to Sound Global Ltd. and BSEE comprises (i) an A-loan of \nup to $100 million in dollars and yuan, and (ii) a complementary loan of up to $200 million \nequivalent in dollars and yuan. ADB will fund the A-loan from its ordinary capital resources; the \ncomplementary loan will be funded by participating banks with ADB acting as lender of record. \nThe  proposed  A-loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  up  to  10  years  from  the  date  of  the  first \ndisbursement. The complementary loan will have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the \nA-loan.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n22.  The project will bring urgently needed infrastructure into rural areas. Access to finance is \nidentified as one of the key bottlenecks to better sector performance. City commercial banks are \nless active in rural areas. Rural credit cooperatives and village and township banks are the main \nofficial banking institutions servicing borrowers outside of cities. Each branch office cannot \noperate beyond its designated township or village. Their loans are mainly provided to township \nand village enterprises, which are managed by township and village governments. ADB support \nis crucial to encourage private sector participation in rural environmental infrastructure, where \ncommercial finance is still scarce. \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s value addition is to link the private sector-led rural infrastructure projects with the \nwider financing community, including international banks by aggregating small-scale subprojects \nand providing in-depth technical and safeguard due diligence. ADB\u2019s assistance is designed to \nlower  transaction  costs  by  adopting  a  portfolio  approach  to  finance  multiple  wastewater \ntreatment subprojects, which are often too small and time-consuming for international banks to \nfinance on a stand-alone basis. \n \nC.  Risks \n24.  Revenue risk. Sound Global Ltd. still derives a majority of its revenue from construction \nservices, which has only short-term revenue visibility and is dependent on a steady stream of \nengineering  procurement  construction  contract  wins.  However,  greater  emphasis  on \nenvironmental  protection  in  the  PRC  should  result  in  higher  demand  for  engineering \nprocurement construction services and Sound Global Ltd. can leverage its in-house research \ncapabilities to secure more contracts. In the BOT segment, Sound Global Ltd.\u2019s subprojects \noperate under standardized concession arrangements with guarantee minimum offtake and \nregulated cost\u2013plus tariffs. Further mitigating this risk are (i) large latent demand for rural \nwastewater  treatment  and  (ii)  strong  policy  pressure  for  tariff  reform  to  achieve  full  cost-\nrecovery. \n \n25.  Offtake  counterparty  risk. Wastewater treatment fees are publicly announced and \nreliably collected from end-users through bundling with water distribution fees and backstopped \nby host governments under concession agreement obligations. Sound Global Ltd. practices \ncomprehensive financial analysis of government counterparties. The project benefits from its \nportfolio approach to diversify offtake risk among subprojects. \n ", "8 \n26.  Financial risk. Sound Global Ltd.\u2019s new business strategy to shift to more BOT and \nbuild\u2013transfer projects will require large up-front capital costs. Each BOT concession will need \nto be debt financed through long-term project loans, which will increase Sound Global Ltd.\u2019s \nfinancial leverage. At the same time, free cash flow at the project level will remain negative for \nthe first few years of operation. The risk is partially mitigated by (i) Sound Global Ltd.\u2019s strong \nliquidity position with sufficient cash on hand and revenue growth from its cash-generating \nconstruction business, (ii) more stable and predictable operating cash flows from its expanding \nportfolio of BOT projects, and (iii) strengthened equity base after recent full conversion of \nconvertible notes. \n \n27.  Completion  and  operating  risk.  Sound  Global  Ltd.  has  a  proven  technical  and \nmanagement track record in construction, and operation and maintenance. The risk is mitigated \nby the homogeneous nature of the subprojects, and the modularized and standardized nature of \nthe SMART technology, as well as low number of staff required for plant operation. \n \n28.  Associated  infrastructure  risk. The success of a wastewater treatment subproject \nrelies not only on the construction and operation of the plant, but also on the readiness and \nreliability  of  the  associated  infrastructure,  especially  the  pipelines  and  pump  stations. \nTraditionally, this infrastructure is constructed and owned by municipal governments. This risk is \npartly mitigated by Sound Global Ltd.\u2019s business model to take over the construction of trunk \nsewage pipelines under a build\u2013transfer arrangement. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n29.  Safeguards. The project is classified category B for environment as potential adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  of  future  subprojects  are  negligible  if  the  water  treatment  system \nfunctions properly. Detailed facility location, design, and operation plans will be determined by \nthe concession agreements, and an initial environmental examination will be prepared for the \nproject according to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), after subprojects are identified. \nThe initial environmental examination will include an environmental management plan, which \nwill manage possible environmental adverse impacts during construction and operation. \n30.  At this stage, ADB proceeds are not allocated for implementing specific subprojects. \nTherefore, this loan is classified as general corporate finance, defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. Sound Global Ltd. commissioned qualified external experts to conduct a \ncorporate audit of its current environmental and social management system (ESMS) and the \ncompany\u2019s past and current performance against the objectives, principles, and requirements of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The experts prepared corrective action plans for the current \nESMS to address gaps identified between the current ESMS and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements. The company has committed to incorporate the corrective action plans \ninto its ESMS. ADB will confirm the company\u2019s revised ESMS before the first disbursement. \n \n31.  The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for \nindigenous peoples. The audit finds that the land acquisition is expected to be located in \nsparsely populated rural areas near or surrounding the townships, which reduces impacts on \nlocal residents. As the area is generally nonresidential, house demolition in the buffer zone can \nbe avoided. Land acquisition is not expected to be significant and is normally carried out by the \nlocal governments before awarding the concession. The audit also finds that the client needs to ", "9 \nimprove its ESMS performance and staffing issues. Sound Global Ltd. will follow its revised \nESMS prior to the disbursement for the first subproject and hire capable staff to ensure that the \nESMS is implemented. The ESMS will include resettlement policy principles and procedures to \nmake sure that subprojects using ADB funds are screened. If the subprojects entail physical and \neconomic displacement, resettlement plans will be prepared following national laws of the PRC \nand in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, Requirement 2 on Involuntary \nResettlement. The audit also notes that the project will not impact ethnic minorities. \n \n32.  Other social dimensions. The project is categorized as no gender elements. Sound \nGlobal Ltd. upholds gender equality, and provides equal benefits and training opportunities for \nboth men and women. Priorities are provided to women if the jobs are more appropriate for \nfemale staff, such as in the finance and human resource departments, and laboratories. Sound \nGlobal Ltd. is committed to undertaking the following measures: (i) support the engagement of \nwomen in construction activities by contractors, and (ii) regularly reach out to concerns of \nresidents including women, through consultations with resident welfare associations. Sound \nGlobal Ltd. will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and report regularly to ADB on \nmeasures taken to ensure compliance (including that of contractors) with national labor laws \nand adherence to internationally recognized core labor standards.20 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n33.  Sound  Global  Ltd.  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n34.  The proposed direct loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n35.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),21 the government\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to Sound Global Ltd. and \nBSEE  will  be  obtained.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of \nDirectors. \n \nV.
