I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan  of  up  to  $75,000,000  or  its  AZN  equivalent  to  AccessBank  Azerbaijan  (ABA);  (ii)  a \nproposed A-loan of up to $20,000,000 or its AZN equivalent to Finca Azerbaijan (FIA), and (iii) a \nproposed B-loan of up to $5,000,000 to FIA to be funded by participating commercial banks, for \nImproving Financial Service Outreach for Agriculture in Azerbaijan.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Fueled  by  hydrocarbons,  the  Azerbaijan  economy  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate   \n12.4%  during  2001\u20132013,  supporting  an  impressive  reduction  in  poverty  by  public  work \nprograms and budget transfers, with the poverty headcount falling from 50% in 2000 to 5% in \n2013. However, rural areas have benefitted from this achievement less than urban areas, and \nthe sustainability of this benefit is vulnerable, as hydrocarbon income is expected to diminish by \n2034. In view of this challenge, the government is emphasizing inclusive growth with a focus on \ndiversifying away from hydrocarbons into productive sectors. Foremost is agriculture, which \nemploys 38% of the labor force, but only generated 5.7% of gross domestic product in 2013. \nThe  lagging  performance  of  agriculture\u2014which  is  the  primary  source  of  employment  and \nincome for nearly half the population\u2014points to its low productivity, providing mainly low wage \nand seasonal jobs that contribute to poverty vulnerability.2 Improving agricultural productivity is \ncentral to developing the rural economy and is the most direct route to improving employment \nand income opportunities. \n \n3.  Structural  issues  and  inefficiencies  contribute  to  low  agricultural  productivity.  Land \nreforms  after  independence  in  1990  distributed  1.3  million  hectares  of  agricultural  land  to \n870,000 households. Cereal production, which increased by a compound annual growth rate \n(CAGR) of 8% during 2000\u20132009, has since stagnated. Food and livestock production show a \nsimilar picture. Today, smallholders produce 90% of agricultural goods on farms of less than 3 \nhectares,  posing  challenges  for  improving  farmer  know-how  and  scale  production,  which \nrequires  massive  fixed  and  working  capital  investments.  Marketing  of  produce  is  largely \nuncoordinated by companies that lack adequate storage, causing high wastage of produce and \nexcessive charges to farmers. Factors resulting in low agricultural productivity include (i) small \nfarm size, (ii) low quality standards, (iii) the absence of efficient logistics and marketing, (iv) \ninadequate irrigation infrastructure, (v) limited research and slow adoption of modern agricultural \npractices, (vi) low integration of farmers into agribusiness value chains, and (vii) limited and \ncostly access to financial services. Foremost, limited access to affordable funding constrains \ninvestment for many small farmers. \n \n4.  Rural residents have inadequate access to finance. Banking is highly concentrated in the \ncapital, Baku, representing 83% of bank loans and 92% of deposits.3 Penetration to rural areas \nis  poor,  as  many  villages  lack  access  to  basic  financial  services.  Regions  outside  Baku \nrepresent 78% of the population and 62% of entrepreneurs; they receive only 17% of lending. In \n2013, agriculture obtained only 5% of institutional credit (footnote 3). \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. On 21 February 2015, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan \nannounced a 34% devaluation of the Azerbaijan manat against the dollar. In this report, historical financial analysis \nuses the historical exchange rate. The use of the new exchange rate is indicated where relevant.   \n2  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3  Government of Azerbaijan, Central Bank of Azerbaijan. 2014. Monthly Bulletin December. Baku. \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Low  financial  services  outreach  to  agriculture  is  a  major  impediment  to  improving \nproductivity. Typical financial services to farmers are limited to basic payments and deposits \nand,  to  a  lesser  extent,  credit,  as  lending  processes  require  collateral  and  financial \ndocumentation that most farmers are unable to produce. Services customized to a farmer\u2019s \ncash flow are still in their infancy. Creative solutions are needed to address the challenge of \nlimited financial inclusion and low agricultural productivity. \n \n6.  Compared with emerging markets in Eastern Europe, Azerbaijan\u2019s depth and efficiency \nof financial intermediation is low, as evidenced by the low private credit\u2013gross domestic product \nratio of 30.5% (2014) and high lending\u2013deposit rate spreads. The finance sector depends \nlargely on external borrowing, as evidenced by the high loan\u2013deposit ratio of 166% (2014) \nreflecting weak savings. A 2011 survey indicated that only 15% of the adult population had a \nsavings account and only 2% of those who indicated having saved during the preceding year \nhad done so through a bank, reflecting public mistrust of the banking system.4 \n \n7.  On  21  February  2015,  the  Central  Bank  of  Azerbaijan  (CBAR)  announced  a  34% \ndevaluation of the manat against the dollar. The devaluation follows the decline in oil prices, the \ndrain of foreign reserves and bank deposit, as well as deposit shifts from manat to dollar. \nCBAR\u2019s  move  aims  to  improve  diversification  and  competitiveness  of  the  non-oil  sectors, \nespecially agriculture. The immediate impact to the finance sector is a significant reduction of \nbank and nonbank capital adequacy given their significant foreign currency lending.5 Adverse \nasset liability currency mismatches can be mitigated by (i) prudential open currency position \nlimits imposed by CBAR, (ii) currency hedging contracts, and (iii) prudent underwriting policies \nof some banks that require comfortable debt service ratios as risk buffers. As some loans will \nshow stress in debt service, financial intermediation will be subdued in 2015. This underscores \nthe need for international financial institutions (IFIs) to instill public confidence in markets by \ncontinuing operations with commercially sound financial institutions. \n \n8.  To improve financial inclusion in Azerbaijan and, in particular, the low outreach of the \nformal financial sector to agriculture, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) selected ABA, an \nexisting partner and the sixth largest bank in Azerbaijan with $1.2 billion assets (25 February \n2015); and FIA, the largest nonbank financial institution with $231 million of assets (25 February \n2015) and the most extensive rural footprint, as a new ADB partner.  ABA provides loans \ntypically in the range of $1,000 to $3 million with an average loan size of $5,200; whereas FIA, \nthrough its village banking model, offers smaller loans of up to $100,000, with an average size \nof $1,557. While the customer segments targeted by ABA and FIA overlap, the market is quite \nlarge and demand is high. Customers in remote villages and small enterprises can also benefit \nfrom competition of services, thereby improving their connectivity to markets and value chains. \nGiven the leading role of ABA and FIA in agriculture finance over the past 8 years, both should \nretain their continued focus despite the adverse  devaluation impact. Both institutions have \nstrong  corporate  governance,  supported  by  their  IFI  shareholders,  sound  and  responsible \nlending processes, strong development orientation, and an ability to develop products to further \npenetrate underserved agriculture segments. The December 2014 Fitch rating upgrade of ABA \nto BBB\u2013 investment grade underscores ADB\u2019s and Fitch\u2019s comfort with shareholder support.6  \n \n                                                \n4  A.

ADB has supported the development of private finance in Azerbaijan since 2005 with \ninterventions  to  build  up  banks  that  finance  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(MSMEs). Initially, this support largely benefited banks and enterprises centered in the capital. \nTo support increased access to finance in secondary towns and rural regions, ADB provided in \n2013 a loan to ABA who expanded its regional footprint through branch openings and support to \nfarmers and small trade and service businesses.7 However, an enhanced focus is needed to \nadvance the outreach of custom-suited financial products for agriculture through sound financial \ninstitutions and, especially in the short term, to respond to the adverse devaluation impact. \n \nB.  AccessBank Azerbaijan  \n \n10.  Business  overview  and  strategy.  Established  in  2002  as  a  greenfield  bank  by \ninternational investors, ABA is now the leading lender to MSMEs in Azerbaijan, serving 160,000 \nborrowers with a loan portfolio of $0.9 billion (28 February 2015). In 2007, ABA established its \nmicro-agriculture loan product, which represents 18% of its loans. ABA\u2019s extensive network of \n37 branches located outside Baku provides a good platform to reach farmers. ABA\u2019s non-IFI \ncommercial borrowing is expected to increase more than twofold by 2017 from $204 million \n(2014) to become at par with traditional IFI and microfinance investment fund (MIF) borrowing \nand deposits. During 2013\u20132014, annual credit growth averaged 40%, or double the business \ntarget. The ABA business plan for 2015\u20132018 projects a more moderate loan portfolio CAGR of \n15%, which is prudent in the context of the adverse impact on demand under moderating growth \nscenarios. ABA will review its business plan for 2015 to reflect the market impact of the recent \nmanat devaluation. While moderation of credit demand is likely for 2015, it is expected to be \ntemporary.  \n \n11.  Ownership.  ABA  is  predominantly  owned  by  IFIs,  with  Black  Sea  Trade  and \nDevelopment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International \nFinance Corporation, and German development cooperation through KfW each holding 20% of \nshares. Access Microfinance Holding AG holds 16.5% and LFS Financial Systems 3.5%.8 IFIs \nprovide strong support through continued funding. \n \n12.  Management. ABA\u2019s board of management (BOM) is chaired by the chief executive \nofficer (CEO), and has two additional members responsible for (i) business banking and risk, \nand (ii) retail banking and operations. The CEO, a German commercial banker with 19 years of \nexperience in Europe and the Russian Federation, joined ABA in mid-2012. The other members \nare Azerbaijani nationals with strong academic backgrounds and in-depth knowledge of ABA \noperations,  having  moved  up  from  credit  officers  to  their  current  positions  since  ABA\u2019s \nestablishment. The BOM sets strategic targets for approval by the board of directors (BOD). \n \n13.  Governance structure. A two-tier board, the BOD and the BOM, governs ABA. The \nBOD  oversees  implementation  of  key  policies,  approves  strategies  and  business  plans, \nappoints management, and monitors their performance. The four IFIs nominate four of the five \ndirectors (including the chairperson), who are currently all senior bankers with international \nexperience. Access Microfinance Holding nominates the other director, a German banker, who \nwas ABA\u2019s first CEO. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2013.

ABA\u2019s audit department reports directly to the BOD audit committee and is led by an \nexperienced auditor. The external auditor changes periodically, with Ernst and Young holding \nthe mandate since 2013. Historically, audit observations relate to addressing minor fraud cases \nidentified at branches. ABA dismisses staff if fraud is substantiated. To reduce operating risk \nand meet the requirements of its growing business, ABA successfully migrated to Temenos 24, \nan advanced core banking system. Audits have not identified any major accounting, operating \nrisk, or compliance issues. ABA internal audits have improved through a focus on risk-based \naudit supported by specialized software. ABA\u2019s audit function is well established. In 2013 ABA \nestablished  a  unit  reporting  to  the  CEO  to  identify  suspicious  transactions  by  scanning \ninformation  by  source  of  wealth,  politically  exposed  persons,  and  watch  lists.  ABA  has \nestablished \u201cknow your customer\u201d processes and policies countering money laundering and the \nfinancing of terrorism. ABA reports findings to the CBAR Financial Services Unit.9 \n \n15.  Total capital adequacy. Under Basel I (using international financial reporting standards) \nand national prudential regulations, ABA comfortably exceeded prudential requirements, backed \nby a conservative dividend policy and high profitability supporting the buildup of capital through \nretained earnings. Although Basel I capital adequacy declined from 24.3% to 22.5% during \nFebruary 2015, and regulatory capital adequacy declined from 16.3% to 14.0% due to the \nmanat devaluation, it remains well within the prudential limit of 12%.  \n \n16.  Loan portfolio and asset quality. ABA\u2019s loan book is segmented into 41% micro loans \n(18% agriculture), 47% small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) loans, and 12% retail and \nmortgage loans (31 March 2015). The manat devaluation resulted in an 11% reduction of the \nloans in dollar terms. Currently, 62% of the loans are in dollars to about 16,000 borrowers that \nearn revenues in manat\u2014mainly SME and mortgage borrowers\u2014who almost all continue to \nreport very strong asset quality. ABA\u2019s asset quality remains very strong due to rigorous client \nselection and monitoring, short cash-flow cycle of loans, high degree of repeat loans, effective \nintegration of sales and risk functions, and a quality-oriented bonus system. The nonperforming \nloan ratio was 1.2% in 2014, and since 2007 has never exceeded 1.4%.10 While asset quality \nmay temporarily deteriorate in 2015, it is expected to remain very healthy. To comply with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards 9, ABA developed a model to estimate probability of \ndefault and loss-given default through back testing its portfolio on the 2008\u20132009 crisis scenario. \nThis model is currently being updated to reflect the latest devaluation. The granularity of the \nloan portfolio and MSME sector diversification support the robustness of asset quality.  \n \n17.  Earnings and profitability. Net income grew at a CAGR of 27% during 2008\u20132014 \nreaching $43 million in 2014. In 2014, return on equity was a solid 33.2% and return on assets \n4.7%. Although ABA\u2019s net interest margin (NIM) dropped by 150 basis points in 2014, reflecting \nfalling interest rates due to increased competition, it remained strong relative to emerging \nmarket comparators and appropriate due to ABA\u2019s staff-intensive business model. Profitability is \nexpected to moderate, with a temporary decline in 2015 reflecting cost of the branch expansion \nand tightening margins due to increased competition and the recent manat devaluation. \n \n18.  Liquidity, funding, and market risk. Deposits increased from 14% in 2008 to 39% in \n2014, while commercial borrowings dropped to 61% of total funding. However, significant manat \n                                                \n9  Azerbaijan participates in the Financial Action Task Force. Its compliance is monitored by MONEYVAL Council of \nEurope Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of \nTerrorism. \n10 In this report, nonperforming loans are defined as the sum of loans (i) overdue above 90 days but not impaired,  \n(ii) impaired according to International Financial Reporting Standards, and (iii) restructured within 12 months of the \nreporting date and not included in (i) or (ii). \n ", "5 \ndeposits has been shifted to dollars and partly withdrawn, indicating that retail deposits are \nvulnerable to withdrawal and dollarization. To address this vulnerability, ABA plans to improve \nits customized services and provide a more customer-friendly branch environment, as well as \nnew contractual term investment products for retail customers. ABA\u2019s funding strategy aims to \nminimize deposit volatility through commercial borrowings targeted to reach equal funding for (i) \ndeposits, (ii) commercial external borrowings, and (iii) IFI and MIF borrowing. ABA matches its \nforeign currency funding with lending in the same currency, and requires customer debt service \nratios of at least 1.5. In the absence of cross currency swaps, the minimum debt service ratios \nare appropriate to manage currency-induced credit risk. \n   \nC.  Finca Azerbaijan  \n \n19.  Business overview and strategy. Established in 1998 and licensed as a nonbank \ncredit institution, FIA is the leading nonbank lender to microenterprises and farm households \nserving 156,000 borrowers, with $191 million in loans (25 February 2015). In 2012, FIA shifted \nfrom group to individual lending, which now represents more than 75%. Agriculture represents \n52% of its loans and its 56 rural branches give it a large platform to reach farmers. FIA\u2019s funding \nstrategy relies on external borrowings from IFIs and MIFs and limited domestic borrowing. \nDuring 2012\u20132014, loans grew at a CAGR of 35% before moderating to 20% in 2014 due to \nincreasing competition. FIA expects agriculture loan growth at $30 million per annum and total \nloan growth at a CAGR of 15% (2015\u20132019) with a temporary moderation in 2015 due to the \ndevaluation. \n  \n20.  Ownership. FIA is owned by Finca Microfinance Cooperatief UA, Netherlands,11 which \nis  owned  by  Finca  Microfinance  Holding  LLC,  Delaware,12 which  is  owned  62%  by  Finca \nInternational Inc. New York, a not-for-profit corporation in the United States (US), and 38% by \nIFIs  including  Financierings  Maatschappij  voor  Ontwikkelingslanden  N.V.,  Netherlands,  the \nInternational Finance Corporation, and KfW, and private MIFs (responsAbility and Triodos). With \ntheir support, FIA has adopted high integrity and responsible finance standards.  \n \n21.  Management. FIA\u2019s BOM comprises the CEO (chair), chief finance officer, and chief \noperations officer, all experienced bankers. The CEO, a US national, is a microfinance banker \nwith 16 years of experience in Eastern Europe and various Finca subsidiaries. The newly \nappointed chief finance officer was previously chief finance officer of Finca Tajikistan. The chief \noperations officer is an Azerbaijan national who has worked for FIA since its establishment. The \nBOM manages FIA\u2019s business and sets strategic targets for approval by the BOD.  \n \n22.  Governance structure. FIA has a two-tier board including the BOD and the BOM. The \nBOD  issues  and  supervises  FIA\u2019s  strategy,  policies,  and management. It  comprises  Finca \nInternational nominees, currently all experienced international bankers, two of which are senior \nstaff at Finca International; the others are 2 CEOs of Finca Eurasia and Middle East South Asia \nsubsidiaries  and  Senior  Investment  Officer  from  Finca  International.  FIA\u2019s  governance \nstandards follow that of all 23 subsidiaries of Finca International, with a strong mission focus on \nsupporting lending to low income households and businesses, staff integrity, transparency, \nprudent lending policies and underwriting, and adequate risk management. FIA governance \nstructures and functions are well established reflecting an adequate separation of functions by \n(i) micro loans; (ii) SME loans; (iii) administration and security; (iv) human resources; (v) legal \n                                                \n11 The Netherlands cooperative structure benefits from a double taxation treaty between the two countries, which is a \ncommon solution for many international MSME lenders to reduce transaction tax. \n12 The incorporation in Delaware is for many US-based companies a choice of default, due to its advanced investor- \nfriendly legislation and favorable corporate taxation.    \n ", "6 \n \nand compliance; and (vi) treasury, accounting, and financial control. \n \n23.  FIA\u2019s audit department is led by an experienced auditor. The external auditor changes \nperiodically, with Deloitte holding the mandate since 2012. Usually audit observations relate to \naddressing minor fraud identified at branches, leading to staff dismissal if substantiated. Audit \nobservations have not identified any major accounting, operating, or compliance issues. FIA\u2019s \naudit function is well established and supervised by Finca International. FIA has dedicated staff \nreporting to the CEO to identify suspicious transactions by scanning information by source of \nwealth,  politically  exposed  persons,  and  watch  lists.  It  has  \u201cknow  your  customer\u201d  policies \ncountering money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and reports findings to CBAR. \n \n24.  Capital  adequacy.  As  a  nonbank  financial  institution,  FIA  uses  a  more  restrictive \ncapital\u2013assets ratio than the capital to risk-weighted assets used by banks. Since 2010, FIA has \ncomfortably exceeded prudential minimum requirements for banks supported by healthy profits \nand moderate dividends, allowing a buildup of capital through retained earnings. Although the \nrecent manat devaluation resulted in a drop of capital adequacy from 18% to 16%, it remains \nabove the 12% prudential limit for banks.  \n \n25.  Loan portfolio and asset quality. Micro loans made up 98% of FIA\u2019s loans, 56% of \nthese for agriculture and 2% for SMEs (25 February 2015). FIA has maintained sound asset \nquality with a portfolio at risk greater than 30 days of 1.4% of the gross loan portfolio at the end \nof 2014. This is supported by a rigorous client selection and monitoring process, the short cash-\nflow cycle of loans, and the high granularity of the loan portfolio. Although the nonperforming \nloan ratio increased by 100 basis points due to increased competition and signs of cross-\nindebtedness of some borrowers in 2014, it remained comfortable at 1.4%. About 13,000 (or \n8%) FIA borrowers currently borrow dollar-denominated loans while relying on manat revenues \nhave now realized the adverse impact of the manat devaluation through an increase in their \nloan principal. The impact on FIA is mitigated through prudent underwriting policies, requiring a \nminimum debt service ratio of 1.4, which is likely to absorb the devaluation impact. While asset \nquality may temporarily deteriorate in this segment in 2015, it is manageable given FIA\u2019s robust \nasset quality and underwriting standards.  \n \n26.  Earnings. Net income was $10 million in 2014 with a CAGR of 31%. Return on equity \nexceeded 20% during 2011\u20132014, primarily the result of high business growth and healthy \ninterest margins. While FIA\u2019s NIM contracted by almost 7% during 2011\u20132014, and is expected \nto contract further due to increasing competition, profitability remained sound with return on \nequity  at  23.1%  and  return  on  assets  at  4.2%  in  2014.  FIA\u2019s  NIM  remains  strong  and \nappropriate due to FIA\u2019s staff-intensive, low transaction volume business model. Although FIA \nanticipates an annual loan growth rate of 15% during 2015\u20132019, it expects net profits to \ntemporarily contract in 2015 due to higher provisioning, reduced operating margins, and the \nadverse impact of the manat devaluation. \n  \n27.  Liquidity and market risk. With its development-focused business model and good \nprofitability and asset quality, FIA is attractive for IFI and MIF funding, which represents 78% of \nits funding. Domestic commercial banks provided the remaining 22% in 2014. FIA is hedging its \nforeign exchange exposures through hedges with domestic and international counterparties \narranged  by  The  Currency  Exchange,  MFX  Solutions,  and  the  International  Finance \nCorporation.  \n \n   \n ", "7 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n28.  The proposed ADB assistance entails two direct senior, unsecured loan facilities for  \n(i) ABA of up to $75 million (or AZN equivalent) with a maximum 7-year tenor, and (ii) FIA of up \nto $25 million comprising, of an A-loan of up to $20 million (or AZN equivalent) with a maximum \n6-year tenor, and a B-loan of up to $5 million with a 4-year tenor to be funded by participating \ncommercial banks. The loan to ABA will be structured in several tranches, each with a 5-year \nmaturity, to be drawn down within a 2-year period. The loan to FIA will also be structured in \ntranches, each with a 4-year maturity, to be drawn down within a 2-year period. The proceeds \nwill be used exclusively to support borrowers engaged in agricultural production, processing, \nlogistics, and marketing.13   \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n29.  ABA  and  FIA  will  provide  annual  audited  financial  statements,  quarterly  financial \nstatements, and compliance certificates for agreed covenants. Reporting includes updates on  \n(i) financial, solvency, and profitability metrics; (ii) governance, safeguards, and social protection \ncompliance; and (iii) business performance and utilization of the ADB loans. ADB will field \nmissions at least annually to review and discuss progress with ABA and FIA management.14 \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n30.  Economic diversification and access to finance. The proposed loans to ABA and FIA \nwill support economic diversification away from hydrocarbons and improve access to working \nand fixed investment capital for agriculture, and lead the way for the finance sector to fund \nhouseholds  and  MSMEs  operating  in  agriculture.  The  concurrent  support  of  two  leading \ninstitutions will support competition to the benefit of farmers by earning higher incomes. This in \nturn will support poverty reduction in the regions. \n \n31.  Long-term funding. ADB loans will help increase the tenor for lending to agriculture \nMSMEs and provide stable long-term funding to ABA and FIA that cannot be raised through \ndeposits and domestic borrowings, given the public\u2019s limited confidence in Azerbaijan capital \nmarkets. While commercial funding is expected to return, financial institutions continue to rely \nheavily on IFIs to fund their asset growth. ADB\u2019s contribution also helps diversify ABA and FIA \nfunding sources. Along with ongoing IFI support, the loans will send a strong signal to the \nmarket to boost confidence that is currently shaken by the manat devaluation.  \n \n32.  Leveraging resources from the private sector. ADB expects to mobilize commercial \nparticipation in the project and leverage its assistance through expected risk participations and a \nB-loan, which is important given the country\u2019s current environment.  \n \n33.  Technical assistance. ADB\u2019s loans will be complemented by technical assistance to \nhelp  improve  ABA\u2019s  manat  resource  mobilization  (retail  term  deposits  and  contractual \ninvestment products) and agriculture finance product offerings; as well as FIA\u2019s outreach to \nremote villages and farmers through mobile banking and financial literacy programs.15 The \n                                                \n13 Subloans will not exceed $3 million equivalent. \n14 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Azerbaijan for Capacity Building for Rural Financial Inclusion. \nManila. \n ", "8 \n \nliteracy programs will help address potential over-indebtedness of households. Through close \non-site monitoring and dialogue with ABA and FIA management and their shareholders, ADB \nwill strengthen relationships with holding companies of both institutions and develop business \nopportunities to support financial inclusion in the south Caucasus and Central Asia regions.              \n \nD.  Risks \n \n34.  Country risk. Financial institutions are exposed to the hydrocarbon market cycles, given \nAzerbaijan\u2019s dependence on oil production and to a lesser extent non-oil exports in the context \nof currency devaluations and slowing demand of Azerbaijan\u2019s neighboring trade partners. ABA \nand FIA have well-diversified risk exposures through substantial business in the regions and \ngranular MSME loans in multiple sectors. \n \n35.  Currency risk and related asset liability management. The manat devaluation was an \nunprecedented step taken by CBAR to respond to the significant net outflow of foreign currency \nreserves, prompted by the devaluation of trading partners\u2019 currencies and decline of oil prices. \nThis has impacted banks\u2019 capital adequacy, dollarization of deposits, and to some extent asset \nquality and profitability. ABA and FIA have strong IFI shareholder and parent support to raise \nnew equity and debt. Both have robust risk management processes that have proven effective. \nExperience from the 2009 crisis has proven their ability to withstand large shocks such as the \nimpact of devaluation. ABA and FIA have effectively mitigated an important part of this risk by \nhedging and limiting open dollar positions. Subject to market conditions and availability, the \nADB loans may be partly funded in manat. While further adjustment cannot be ruled out, the \nrecent devaluation somewhat mitigates market uncertainty regarding government actions.  \n \n36.  Corporate  governance  and  integrity.  Azerbaijan  banks  typically  have  significant \nexposure  to  related  party  transaction  lending  and  weakness  in  corporate  governance  and \nintegrity. Supported by their international and IFI shareholders, ABA and FIA have built a strong \nintegrity culture to withstand such pressures and are leading the way for other institutions. \n \n37.  Asset quality and internal controls. Although asset quality is very strong, rapid loan \ngrowth and signs of household cross-indebtedness may expose ABA and FIA to higher credit \nrisk, particularly for borrowers affected by the manat devaluation. ABA and FIA are limiting this \nrisk by maintaining prudent underwriting and using credit registry information.  \n \n38.  Profitability. Competition in Baku and the manat devaluation will impact the margins \nand profitability of ABA and FIA in 2015. Their business focus will strengthen their competitive \nposition in the regions, and efforts to enhance efficiency will mitigate this risk. \n \n  \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n39.  Impact.  The  expected  impact  is  increased  availability  of  credit  to  agriculture  in \nAzerbaijan. This will be reflected by increased private bank credit to agriculture.  \n  \n40.  Outcome. The expected outcome is sustained financial service provision by ABA and \nFIA to farmers, and agriculture MSMEs. ABA and FIA are expected to set examples for other \nfinancial institutions in funding farmers and agriculture MSMEs, thus providing employment and \nincome opportunities. \n \n ", "9 \n41.  Outputs. ABA and FIA will improve their service outreach to agriculture in particular by \noffering a wider product range customized to farmer and MSME needs. Emphasizing lending \nbased on MSME cash flows, expanding into remote areas, and providing term finance will help \nserve the regional economy and diversify ABA\u2019s risk and income profile. \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n42.  Consistency with  ADB  strategy and country strategy. Inclusive finance is a key \nfocus of ADB assistance as set forth in the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which notes \neconomic growth, stimulated by private investment and finance sector development, as a key \ncontributing factor in reducing poverty; and emphasizes the importance of generating jobs, with \nprivate employment being the major income source for workers and their families. 16 Inclusive \nfinance  will  be  supported  through  the  emphasis  of  ABA  and  FIA  on  agriculture  where \nproductivity is low, and the potential for employment and income generation is high. The loans \nto ABA and FIA will reach agriculture MSMEs and farmers, providing longer tenors for their \ninvestments. This is consistent with government and ADB strategy to promote diversification to \nprivate non-oil activities through deepening financial intermediation across the agriculture value \nchain.17  \n   \n43.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. Inclusive finance is \nalso a key focus of ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan. MSME beneficiaries of financial \nintermediation  are  important  employers  and  providers  of  income.  Supporting  financial \nintermediaries is important to instill confidence and restore the finance sector in countries \naffected  by  macroeconomic  shocks  and  financial  crises.  Since  2005,  ADB  has  provided \nnonsovereign loans of $120 million to banks, comprising loans to ABA, Azerigas Bank, Bank \nRespublika, and Demir Bank, as well as to International Bank of Azerbaijan. ADB also plays an \nimportant role in supporting microfinance in Azerbaijan through sovereign interventions.18 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n44.  The investments are classified category FI for environment, and FI treated as C for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social \nimpacts of the investments and associated risks were assessed, as well as the commitment and \ncapacity of ABA and FIA for environmental and social management. Their business activities \nare unlikely to entail impacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. ABA and FIA \nwill  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list;  exclude  subloans  categorized  A  for \nenvironment  and  A  or B for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous peoples;  ensure  that \ninvestments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, as well as ADB \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009); take measures to comply with internationally recognized \ncore labor standards including provisions prohibiting any discrimination against women in hiring \nand providing equal pay for equal work for men and women in compliance with ADB Social \nProtection  Strategy  (2001);  and  in  the  case  of  FIA,  finalize  its  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system satisfactory to ADB before ADB\u2019s first disbursement of the respective \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2014.

ABA and FIA were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance.   \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n46.  The proposed senior loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary resources are within the medium-term \ncountry, industry, group, and single investment exposure limits for nonsovereign operations, \nand, in the case of ABA, loan disbursements will be monitored over the availability period to \nensure that amounts will only be disbursed if, at the time of such disbursement, the single \ninvestment exposure limit is complied with. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n47.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),20 ADB will take the necessary steps to ensure that the Government of Azerbaijan has \nno objection to the proposed assistance to ABA and FIA. ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n48.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve (i) a loan of \n$75,000,000 or its AZN equivalent to AccessBank Azerbaijan, (ii) an A-loan of $20,000,000 or \nits AZN equivalent to Finca Azerbaijan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and B-loans of up \nto  $5,000,000  to  Finca  Azerbaijan,  to  be  funded  by  participating  commercial  banks,  for \nImproving  Financial  Service  Outreach  for  Agriculture  in  Azerbaijan,  with  such  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board. \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n31 March 2015 \n                                                \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary; and Financial \nIntermediaries: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n20  ADB. 1966.
