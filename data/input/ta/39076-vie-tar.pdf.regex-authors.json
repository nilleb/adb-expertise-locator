Increasing evidence of the rapid deterioration of air quality and the associated potential \nhealth impacts on poor populations in Asian cities prompted the Clean Air Initiative for Asian \nCities (CAI-Asia) secretariat of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to develop a project concept \non air pollution, poverty, and health effects in July 2004.  The Vice President (Operations 1) \napproved the concept clearance request on 25 October 2004. The Fact-Finding Mission was \nheld in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and Hanoi during 1-4 February 2005. The potential partners of \nthe  technical  assistance  (TA)\u2014Health  Effect  Institute  (HEI),  Norwegian  Institute  for  Air \nResearch  (NILU),  East  West  Center  (EWC),  and  United  States\u2014Asia  Environmental \nPartnership (US\u2013AEP)\u2014also took part in the Mission. The People\u2019s Committee of HCMC signed \na  memorandum  of  understanding  covering  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, and financing arrangements of the TA on 30 June 2005. The TA design \nand monitoring framework is given in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  One of the main short-term objectives, set out in the National Strategy for Environmental \nProtection in Viet Nam,2 is to restrict pollution, remedy environmental degradation, and improve \nthe quality of the environment in industrial and densely populated areas in major cities and \nseveral rural areas. Thus, urban air pollution control is an important part of this Government \nstrategy. Reducing air pollution in urban and industrial areas has also been identified as a \npriority area, among others, by the Strategic Orientation for Sustainable Development in Viet \nNam  (Viet  Nam  Agenda  21).3  While  the  environmental  policies  and  strategies  of  the \nGovernment have a clear focus on urban air quality management (AQM), the existing strategies \nhave not related poverty issues with AQM. For example, the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction \nand Growth Strategy (CPRGS) of Viet Nam does not elaborate the linkages between poverty \nreduction and AQM. \n \n3.  The interface between air pollution, health, and poverty in Asia is important, especially, \nin  areas  where  large  populations  of  the  lowest  socioeconomic  status  are  exposed  to  air \npollution. The potential public health and social policy implications under these circumstances \ncan be significant, yet the links among air pollution, poverty, and health effects in the Asian \ncontext are not well understood. There is emerging evidence, largely from studies in North \nAmerica and Europe, that economic deprivation increases the magnitude of air pollution-related \nmorbidity and mortality. Among the reasons why this may be true, two stand out: the poor have \nhigher exposure to air pollution, and/or may be more susceptible to air pollution due to poorer \nnutrition, lack of access to medical care, and other factors. At the same time, air pollution could \nexacerbate the conditions of poverty.  \n \n4.  The economic consequences of an increased burden of diseases due to air pollution, \nincluding cost of illness and loss of income, can also be substantial for the poor. For example, a \nday\u2019s absence from work due to respiratory illness for a permanently employed non-poor person \nmay not be translated into severe economic hardship as he/she can avail of paid sick leave, but \na poor laborer could lose his/her day\u2019s wages. Similarly, a hike in mass transit fare caused by \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 19 February 2005. \n2 Ministry of Natural Resources. 2004.

", "2     \nregulatory actions may be translated into significant diversion of household income for a poor \nperson, but may not impact those who use private means of transport. \n \n5.  Policy makers in Viet Nam and other developing countries in Asia may hold the general \nperception that the poor are disproportionately affected by air pollution and they are more \nsusceptible to air pollution-related morbidity and mortality effects. Yet, there is no scientific \nevidence on health and other effects of air pollution on the poor in Asian cities. The results from \nWestern studies cannot be simply extrapolated to Asia for use in poverty intervention policy \nassessments  either  by  governments  in  Asia  or  by  ADB  and  other  development  agencies. \nMoreover, the composition and relative contribution of indoor and outdoor sources of exposure \nin Asia are different from those in the West and need to be studied in greater detail.  \n  \n6.  AQM is still a relatively new policy area in many Asian countries. Experiences from past \nand ongoing loans and TAs show the importance of decision makers having well-documented \nresearch findings on the negative impacts of air pollution as well as the policy instruments to \ntackle the sources of pollution.4 Previous ADB loans and TAs have frequently referred to the \nassumed relations between health, poverty, and air pollution but have not included in-depth \nanalysis to substantiate this relationship.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The expected project impact is improved air quality and decreased occurrence of air \npollution-related health impacts among the poor populations, in HCMC in particular and in Asian \ncities in general. The impact will be achieved by developing an enabling framework that will \nintegrate  poverty  effects,  perceptions,  coping  mechanisms,  and  economic  burden  of  air \npollution-related health effects into policies and action plans for AQM in HCMC. The TA will \nfacilitate the use of the developed framework by other Asian cities. \n \n8.  The proposed TA will develop a conceptual framework of the linkages among urban air \npollution, poverty and health effects, and empirically test the developed framework in HCMC. \nThe empirical analyses will consist of (i) an assessment of the impact of air pollution on the \nrespiratory health of children in HCMC; (ii) a household survey to assess (a) exposure to \nmultiple sources of air pollution; (b) baseline health conditions; and (c) perceptions, coping \nmechanisms, and economic burden of air pollution; (iii) a policy impact study, which integrates \nthe results from (i) and (ii) for enhanced policy making in AQM for HCMC as well as for the \nCPRGS in Viet Nam.   \n    \n                                                 \n4  ADB  lending  and  non-lending  assistance  on  air  quality  management  include  ADB.1998.

The  TA  will  generate  scientific,  social,  and  economic  information  on  the  linkages \nbetween  air  pollution,  poverty,  and  related  health  impacts  on  communities  in  HCMC.  The \ninformation will help in formulating policies and programs to avoid, minimize, or mitigate such \nimpacts.  More  specifically,  the  outputs  of  the  project  include  (i)  documented  relationships \namong  socioeconomic  status,  air  pollution,  and  health  effects  for  children  in  HCMC;  (ii) \ndocumented  relationship  between  baseline  health  and  exposure  to  multiple  sources  of  air \npollution for the general population stratified by socioeconomic status; (iii) documented evidence \non  perceptions,  coping  mechanism,  and  economic  burden  of  air  pollution,  stratified  by  \nsocioeconomic status in HCMC; (iv) policy options to mitigate air pollution that take specific \naccount of the poor; (v) enhanced local capacity of relevant Viet Nam agencies to undertake \nsimilar analyses of air pollution, poverty, and health effects; and (vi) increased awareness by \ndecision makers and other stakeholders, including the urban poor, in selected countries and \ncities and in ADB, with respect to health impacts, coping mechanisms, and economic burdens of \nair pollution on the poor. Appendix 2 gives an outline of the contents of reports that will be \nproduced under the project. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  Brief descriptions of the study objectives and methodologies, which will be used as the \nstarting point for developing detailed study protocols, are in paras. 11\u201319. The methodologies \nwill be further developed collaboratively by Vietnamese and international researchers and the \nconsultants. \n \n11.  Assessment of Air Pollution Impact on Respiratory Health of Children (component \n1). This component estimates the effect of short-term exposure to air pollution on hospital \nadmission for respiratory illnesses, including acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), among \nyoung children. The study will use existing data from records of two pediatric hospitals on \nclinical  and  sociodemographic  characteristics.  Socioeconomic  status  will  be  determined  in \nseveral ways, including access to free or subsidized health care (medical insurance card) and \nlocation of residence. Air quality data at the HCMC Environmental Protection Agency (HEPA) \nwill be used to estimate daily exposure for children. The impact of air pollution on the respiratory \nhealth of children will be assessed using case-crossover methodology. A stratified analysis will \nbe used to evaluate any differential impacts of socioeconomic status.  \n \n12.  Detailed Assessment of Exposure to Air Pollution among the Poor (component 2). \nExposure  to  outdoor-related  pollution  from  major  \u201cmicroenvironments,\u201d  including  traffic  and \nstationary  sources,  indoor  air  pollution,  environmental  tobacco  smoke,  and  occupational \nexposure  will  be  assessed,  and  differences  in  exposure  by  socioeconomic  status  will  be \nexamined. The findings will help in setting priorities for control strategies to abate air pollution. \nDifferences between modeled estimates of exposure derived from ambient air quality monitors, \nhousehold concentrations, and individual exposures will be explored.   \n \n13.  Baseline Health Survey (component 2). Respiratory health symptoms of household \nmembers will be assessed using internationally accepted survey instruments. Together with the \nresults of the exposure assessment, a baseline health survey can help assess the risk factors \nfor air pollution-related respiratory illnesses. \n \n14.  Public Perceptions Survey (component 2). This activity will assess people\u2019s opinion \non how air pollution affects their lives and what type of coping mechanisms they adopt to avoid \nor minimize the impacts of air pollution. The survey will take account of the details of mitigating \nand averting activities undertaken by people who have been sick due to air pollution.  The ", "4     \nsurvey will also assess people\u2019s perception of appropriate methods for reducing air pollution- \nrelated health impacts. \n \n15.   Economic  Burden  of  Air  Pollution  (component  2).  The  economic  burden  of  air \npollution will be estimated taking into account the cost of mitigation, cost of averting activities, \nand  income  loss  due  to  air  pollution-related  morbidity.  Analysis  will  be  segregated  into \nsocioeconomic groups to compare the impacts on the poor and the non-poor.  \n \n16.   Policy  Analysis  (component  3).  The  existing  air  pollution  policies  and  laws,  and \nregulatory analysis conducted will be reviewed. This component will integrate the findings of all \nthe other components to refine the air pollution control policies and practices, with special \nreference to their impact on poor segments of the population in HCMC. This activity will assess \nthe possibilities of upscaling the finding to other cities and the national level in Viet Nam in \nparticular and in Asia in general. The policy analyses will also focus on the implications of the \nstudy finding on the CPRGS of Viet Nam. \n \n17.   Capacity  Building.  Capacity  building  will  involve  a  number  of  local  and  national \nagencies, including environmental scientists, public health researchers, and biostatisticians, \nwho  will  receive  targeted  training5  as  well  as  on-the-job  experience.  The  special  training \nprograms designed for various technical aspects will be open to a selected number of people \nwho are not involved in the project.  \n \n18.  Awareness  Building.  A  web  page  in  the  CAI-Asia  website \n(http://www.cleanairnet.org/caiasia)  will  be  set  up  to  provide  information  about  the  project \nactivities and its findings. National workshops will be held to inform local stakeholders of the \nproject\u2019s progress. A regional workshop will be held to disseminate the findings of the TA. \nResearchers involved in relevant projects and programs of CAI-Asia in other countries will be \ninvited to the workshops. The researchers will also be invited to visit HCMC to meet the project \nteam and learn about the project approach.  \n \n19.  The project requires the involvement of a number of government agencies in HCMC and \na number of international institutes. An important assumption for the success of the project is \nsmooth  coordination  and  cooperation  between  the  different  agencies  in  conducting  and \nfollowing up on the different studies to be carried out under the project. It is important that the \nsteering  committee,  to  be  established  by  the  HCMC  People\u2019s  Committee,  identify  any \ncoordination  problems  at  an  early  stage  and  develop  quick  responses  to  overcome  any \nproblem. A second important assumption is that secondary data, which have been collected by \ndifferent agencies, will be made available to the groups responsible for project implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $950,000 equivalent comprising $625,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $325,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $600,000 \nequivalent to cover $500,000 of the foreign exchange cost and $100,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. HEI will provide $200,000 equivalent to cover $125,000 of the foreign exchange \ncost and $75,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will provide $150,000 \nequivalent to cover the remaining local currency cost. The ADB component of the TA will be \n                                                 \n5  Capacity building includes targeted training for local agency personnel on statistical analysis, analytical technology, \ndesign and conduct of health and socioeconomics surveys, and operation and maintenance of microenvironment \nair quality monitoring equipment.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The recipient of the Air Pollution Poverty and Health Effects in HCMC (APPH) project is \nthe HCMC People\u2019s Committee. The Committee will appoint a steering committee, which will \noversee  the  implementation  of  the  project  from  the  Viet  Nam  Government\u2019s  side.  The \nDepartment of Health (DOH) of HCMC will take the lead role as the Executing Agency. HEPA, \nDepartment of Natural Resources and Environment of HCMC, and Department of Labor Invalid \nand Social Affairs (DOLISA) of HCMC will serve as implementing agencies. HEPA, DOH, and \nDOLISA will take primary responsibility for pollution, health, and poverty-related aspects of the \nproject, respectively.  \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 30 months commencing in December 2005 and closing \nin May 2008. This period gives adequate time for phasing the planning, implementation, and \nreview  of  the  different  components  under  the  project.  ADB  will  enter  into  a  partnership \nagreement with HEI6 for implementing the project. HEI will enter into sub-agreements with other \ninternational and Vietnamese organizations to assist in implementing the project. Relevant ADB \nguidelines  such  as  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  as  well  as  Guidelines  for \nProcurement will be followed. Appendix 4 describes the main tasks to be realized in the project \nand the areas of expertise required. \n \n23.  APPH will be part of the Public Health and Air Pollution for Asia Program (PAPA), which \nis implemented by HEI on behalf of CAI-Asia. The International Oversight Committee of the \nPAPA program will be requested to provide scientific oversight to the project. DOH will appoint a \nlocal project director and he/she will be working on part-time basis to supervise the project \nactivities. A full-time local project coordinator7 will be recruited to undertake day-to-day activities \nof the project. The project coordinator\u2019s salary will be paid from the project and he/she will carry \nout the work under the guidance of the project director. The methodology and findings of the \nproject will be discussed in three national workshops: inception workshop, midterm workshop, \nand final workshop. A broad group of local, national, and international stakeholders will be \ninvited to the workshops.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n24.  The President acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to the \nGovernment of Viet Nam on a grant basis from the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for the \nAir Pollution, Poverty, and Health Effects in Ho Chi Minh City, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n \n                                                 \n6  The reason for engaging HEI is because of HEI\u2019s track record both internationally as well as in Asia making it the \nbest institute to handle this project. It has been providing globally refuted, high-quality, and relevant scientific \nexpertise  on  the  health  effects  of  air  pollution  since  1980.

Component 1: Case-Crossover Study of Impact of Air Pollution on Children\u2019s \nHospital Admissions in HCMC \n \n1.  This first component is a hospital-based study to assess the impact of air pollution on \nacute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in children in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). The study will \nbe conducted using case-crossover methodology, a method used to examine the acute effects \nof intermittent exposure to air pollution. The study has two major objectives:  \n \n(i)  Estimate the effect of short-term exposure to air pollution on hospital admissions \nfor ALRI in young children (<5 years) in HCMC. \n(ii)  Compare the magnitude of the effect of air pollution on poor children with other \nchildren. \n \n1.  Activities and Tasks \n \n2.  The specific activities are as follows: \n \n(i)  Data on admissions for pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and bronchitis in children under \n5 years of age will be extracted from the computerized records of pediatric \nhospitals  #1  and  #2.  Admissions  for  asthma  may  also  be  included. \nSociodemographic characteristics (including age and sex) for each case will also \nbe obtained. \n(ii)  Poverty status for each case will be determined by access to free or subsidized \ncare (medical insurance card).   \n(iii)  Exposure assessment data will be provided by HCMC Environmental Protection \nAgency (in collaboration with Norwegian Institute for Air Research) \n(iv)  A workshop to train local researchers on methods to evaluate the short-term \nhealth effects of air pollution will be held. \n \n2.  Required Expertise  \n \n3.  Under the partnership agreement between HEI and ADB, HEI will be providing the \nconsulting and other services9 in the following areas of expertise  (approximate person-months \nare enclosed in parentheses): international biostatistician (3), international senior epidemiologist \n(1.5), international quality assurance auditor (2), international and domestic air quality experts \n(5), international senior investigator (1), international junior investigator (2), domestic survey \nadministrator (6), local coordinator (18), and external peer review group10. \n \nB.  Component  2:  Household-Based  Survey:  Pollution  Exposure,  Baseline  Health, \nEconomic Burden, and Public Perceptions of Social Economic Costs Associated \nwith Air Pollution \n \n4.  This component will conduct a household-based survey of exposure to air pollution, \nbaseline  health,  economic  burden,  and  public  perceptions  of  social  and  economic  costs \n                                                 \n9 Subject to the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n10 External peer review will be undertaken by International Oversight Committee of the PAPA program as a honorary \nservice ", "14   Appendix 4 \nassociated with air pollution. A key consideration of the survey will be the ability to maintain \nlinkage with key elements of component 1 (the case-crossover study).   \n \n1.  Exposure Assessment  \n \n5.  This activity aims to test the hypothesis that the poor are more exposed to critical air \npollutants than those who are better-off economically. While households with young children are \nselected, exposure estimates for all members of the family will be made. \n \n2.  Tasks \n \n6.  The specific tasks are as follows: \n \n(i)  Obtain district and ward\u2013level data and maps from local urban planning, land use \nplanning, labor and social issues and surveys such as Vietnam living standards \nsurvey (VLSS) and demographic and health survey (DHS) to identify areas of \nentire city as low-, middle-, and high-income areas. \n(ii)  Design a sampling scheme to select relevant individuals from within those areas. \n(iii)  Assess exposure to selected individuals through the use of 24-hour personal \nmonitoring (individual or in major microenvironments) and detailed daily time \nactivity diaries. \n \n3.   Baseline Health Survey  \n \n7.  A health prevalence study will assess the respiratory health status of all household \nmembers using a survey that will be based on internationally validated survey instruments. If \nfeasible, pulmonary function tests (spirometry) will be performed on a subset of household \nmembers.  These  data,  in  conjunction  with  results  from  the  exposure  component  of  the \nhousehold survey, may provide information on local risk factors for respiratory illness. \n \n4.   Economic Costs and Public Perceptions  \n \n8.  The aims of this survey activity are as follows: \n \n(i)  Develop a conceptual model of the direct and indirect costs of and benefits from \nair pollution control at the household level. \n(ii)  Survey households across socioeconomic groups to collect data for the above \nmodel. \n(iii)  With the view to both supplement and complement the insights from (i) and (ii), \nsurvey households for their perceptions regarding air pollution. \n \na.  Tasks \n \n9.  Both focus group discussions and household surveys will be used. The surveys will be \nintegrated with the surveys on activity patterns and health prevalence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "          Appendix  4  15 \nb.  Required Expertise \n \n10.  Under the partnership agreement between HEI and ADB, HEI will be providing the \nconsulting and other services11 in the following areas of expertise  (approximate person-months \nare enclosed in parentheses): international and domestic health economist (4), international air \nquality  expert  (1),  international  quality  assurance  auditor  (2),  international  senior  exposure \nassessment  expert  (7),  international  junior  exposure  assessment  expert  (2),  international \nepidemiologist/biostatistician  (1),  local  survey  administrator  (12),  international  and  local \nperceptions expert (4), local project coordinator (18), surveyors (18) and external peer review \ngroup. \n \nC.  Component 3: Policy Impact Study \n \n11.  This component aims to develop and communicate to decision makers the policy options \nto mitigate air pollution that take specific account of the poor. It will involve institutional analysis \nof air quality management (AQM) stakeholders to analyze their strengths and weaknesses as \nwell as identify key decision makers. Recommendations on how to address air pollution in the \nViet Nam Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) will be discussed \nin consultations with local and national decision makers and other stakeholders, including the \nurban poor in HCMC as well as poverty specialists in the Asian Development Bank (ADB).     \n \n1.  Activities and Tasks \n \n12.  The following activities will be undertaken: \n \n(i)  Review existing and proposed AQM-related policies outlining the relative benefits \nto  different  groups  in  the  community  from  implementation  of  one  or  more \nmeasures, as well as the specific impact on the poor. \n(ii)  Review  and  analyze  the  existing  institutional  framework  to  assess  the \nresponsibilities  of  each  relevant  institution  in  monitoring  and  enforcing  air \npollution management. \n(iii)  Hold  a  regional  workshop  to  increase  awareness  of  decision  makers  and \nstakeholders, including the urban poor in selected countries and cities, and ADB \nwith respect to the impact of air pollution on the poor and the coping mechanisms \nof the poor. \n \n2.
