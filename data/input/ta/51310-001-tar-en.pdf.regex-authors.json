INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the capacity and \nnetworks of university-level educators and institutions to improve the teaching and application of \nenvironmental and climate change laws in developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  leading  to  more  effective  implementation,  compliance,  and \nenforcement of national laws and better implementation of international commitments such as the \nParis Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).1 The TA will (i) improve the quality \nof teaching of environmental and emerging climate change laws through train-the-trainers (TTTs) \nprograms;2 (ii) expand national, subregional, and regional networks; and (iii) enhance knowledge \nplatform to increase national and regional expertise.3 \n \n2.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  (i)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Operational  Directions, 4  which \nemphasize  the  importance  of  strengthening  environmental  governance  and  management \ncapacity, and responding to the climate change imperative towards green growth; (ii) the Climate \nChange Operational Framework, which provides direction for enhancing resilience and supporting \nclimate adaptation and mitigation actions;5 and (iii) the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,6 which \nreaffirms  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  linking  operations  to  inclusive  and  sustainable  growth  by \nimproving governance, strengthening policies, and building capacity.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Environmental  degradation  threatens  ecosystems;  food  and  water  security, 8  and \nlivelihoods,9 particularly  for  the  poor;  and  contributes  to  climate  change  impacts.10 Many \nenvironmental problems are worsened by illegal activities, and exacerbated by weak governance \nand ineffective implementation, compliance, and enforcement. Moreover, sustainability outcomes \nare being impeded by the lack of qualified practitioners who work with and in the government, \njudiciary, private sector and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and possess expertise in \nenvironmental and emerging climate change laws. Although the demand for environmental law \n                                                \n1  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 2016. Paris Agreement (adopted 12 December 2015, \nentered into force 4 November 2016) FCCC/CP/2015/L.9; United Nations. Sustainable Development Goals. The TA \nwill directly address the SDGs relating to environmental and climate change (SDGs 13, 14, and 15), but can also \nhelp achieve SDGs 11 and 16. \n2  Environmental laws regulate the impact of human activities on the environment, and cover a broad range of activities \nthat affect air, water, land, flora, or fauna. For the purposes of this TA, climate change laws generically refer to laws \nrelated to greenhouse gas reduction, emission standards, and adaptation. Climate change law is still under \ndevelopment in many developing countries, and many do not yet have such laws.  \n3 The TA was not included in the regional cooperation operations business plan, management-approved annual work \nprogram of the department or a sector or thematic group, or an endorsed corporate priority, and has therefore been \napproved by the Vice-President for Administration and Corporate Management. \n4  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n9  A recent review by ADB indicates that the Asia and Pacific region has a high dependence on natural capital for \nrevenue generation and employment. ADB. 2017. Opportunities for Investing in Natural Capital. Working paper \n(forthcoming); and ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Promoting Ecosystem Services and Forest Carbon Finance. \nManila (TA 8564-REG). \n10 For example, coastal and marine ecosystems are under threat, with significant losses of mangroves, sea grasses, \nand coral reefs, which reduce coastal resilience to climate change. \n ", "2 \n \nexpertise is growing\u2014resulting from new policies and laws, and in some cases through a new \nsystem  of  specialist  environmental  law  courts\u2014there  are  insufficient  suitably  trained \nenvironmental law experts to work within governments, private companies, and the courts.11 \nAdditionally, the adoption in 2015 of the Paris Agreement and SDGs requires qualified experts to \ntranslate international obligations into domestic policy and law, and support and advise countries \nin conducting international negotiations. \n \n4.  A major challenge in meeting the increasing need for environmental and climate change \nlaw practitioners is the lack of capacity in legal education or academia.12 A recent survey of 14 \nDMCs found that less than half made environmental law a compulsory subject at the basic law \ndegree  level,13 while  many  law  schools  do  not  offer  it  as  an  elective.14 The  teaching  of \nenvironmental law is currently under resourced and inadequate in almost all countries in the Asia \nand Pacific region, even those that have decreed the subject mandatory within a basic law degree \ncurriculum. Most ADB DMCs have insufficient (or an unknown number) of qualified environmental \nlaw professors or specialists, and some DMCs have reported that environmental law is being \ntaught by lecturers with no expertise in the subject. The lack of environmental law capacity is even \nmore prevalent in Greater Mekong Subregion member countries, such as Cambodia and the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).15 Moreover, the teaching of environmental law is \ndifficult because (i) the legal and policy aspects of environmental and climate change issues are \ncomplex, multidisciplinary,  and  evolving;  (ii)  training  programs,  teaching  curricula,  technical \nresources, and tools are very limited; and (iii) many resources are in English, originating from \nAustralia,  Europe  or  the  United  States.  Additionally,  environmental  law  educators  and \npractitioners lack networks linking them to their peers, experts and other stakeholders (e.g., those \nworking in government, the judiciary, NGOs, and the private sector), both in their own countries \nand in the region, for sharing of knowledge and problem solving.16 Similar challenges will apply \nto emerging climate change laws. \n \n5.  To  address  the  need  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  university-level  educators  and \ninstitutions in the teaching and application of environmental laws, ADB approved a regional TA \nproject in December 2013.17 The TA has supported training of an initial batch of 57 law professors \n                                                \n11 On a worldwide basis, numerous constraints result in a lack of legislators, administrators, lawyers, judges, and others \nwho are sufficiently informed about or have the resources to implement sustainable development.

Technical Assistance for Strengthening Capacity for Environmental Law in the Asia\u2013Pacific: Developing \nEnvironmental Law Champions. Manila (TA 8616-REG). A comprehensive report on the state of environmental law \nteaching in the 14 DMCs will be published under this TA. \n16 Effective implementation and enforcement calls for strong interconnection among all those involved in enforcing \nenvironmental laws.

News release. 15 June. \n17 Understanding these international legal frameworks and/or principles will help DMCs implement them at the national \nlevel. The Strengthening Capacity for Environmental Law in the Asia\u2013Pacific: Developing Environmental Law \nChampions (footnote 15, above) started out as a small-scale TA project, but has been scaled up based on demand \nfrom DMCs. It is scheduled to be completed on 30 June 2018. \n ", "3 \nand university lectures from 14 DMCs on a TTT model, focusing on teaching methodologies such \nas role playing, field trips, and reflective journals and covering substantive environmental law, \naddressing issues such as (i) brown issues of air and water pollution, and related national laws \nregarding spatial planning and environmental impact assessment; (ii) natural capital, covering \ngreen laws and biodiversity, wildlife, protected areas, and wetlands; (iii) blue issues and laws \nregarding marine and coastal protection and pollution;  (iv) natural resources laws; and  (v) \nemerging climate change laws. The value of the initial TTT programs was overwhelmingly \nendorsed by participants from the 14 DMCs, who called for additional support from ADB for in-\ncountry TTT programs. The participants agreed that there is a significant need for more training \nprograms of a similar nature in their respective countries; most indicated that they felt inspired to \nimprove their own teaching and contribute to building environmental law capacity in their own \ncountries. Following the initial TTT programs, over 20 TTT program proposals were received from \n14 DMCs under the TA; 6 TTT programs have been supported\u2014in Malaysia, Viet Nam, the \nPhilippines, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Thailand, and Cambodia (together with the \nLao PDR participants)\u2014and one TTT program is expected to be delivered in Myanmar by the \ncompletion of the ongoing regional TA (footnote 15). Through the TTT programs, a willing cadre \nof environmental law champions are now engaged and connected to contribute to the delivery of \nTTT programs, and strengthening the teaching of environmental law in their countries. By the end \nof 2017, these \u201cchampions\u201d will have expanded the TTT programs by training over 230 national \nenvironmental law professors and lecturers from over 160 academic institutions across 14 DMCs, \nand now serve as country focal points leading the efforts to strengthen capacity in their respective \ncountries. \n \n6.  The TTT programs have also led to the emergence of national and regional networks that \nbring together environmental law teachers to share knowledge, network, collaborate, and solve \nproblems. These new networks provide support and inspiration to participants to continue the \nteaching and promotion of environmental law in Asia. A database of environmental law educators \nand institutions\u2014a first in the region\u2014together with teaching materials and resources is available \non the recently launched regional knowledge platform under the ongoing regional TA (footnote \n15).18 The database provides access to environmental law experts in the region, who are available \nfor consultations and to train judges, government officials, and other stakeholders. The regional \nknowledge platform can also be used as a network and knowledge-sharing tool. For example, \nunder the TA, TTT program participants from Malaysia trained the Malaysian session court judges \nresponsible for environmental adjudication in July 2017. After the TTT program at the Peking \nUniversity Law School in October 2016, a WeChat discussion group around environmental law \nissues was established, comprising not only environmental law professors and students but \npractitioners in environmental administration and justice, including some government officials who \nare actively engaging in discussion regarding environmental laws, compliance, and enforcement. \nThe WeChat network has grown to over 500 active members, including environmental protection \nagency agents who use this channel to consult professors on environmental law issues. \n \n7.  Participants under the ongoing regional TA expressed the need for further capacity \nbuilding in their countries and urged support for more TTT programs. Due to limited funding and \nresources, the TTT program proposals from South Asian countries, the southwest PRC, and \nIndonesia  could  not  be  supported  under  the  ongoing TA. The TTT  participants  have  also \nrequested continuing support for existing national and regional networks, which are nascent and \nneed further support to make them self-sustaining. For example, the TTT participants have \nrequested ADB assistance in convening national roundtables (in-person and electronic) to focus \non national issues and national networks, and requested an enhanced knowledge platform to \n                                                \n18 http://www.teachenvirolaw.asia/ \n ", "4 \n \ninclude more national and regional resources and localized materials, as well as e-learning \ncourses to supplement the in-person TTT programs. Discussions on sustainability measures for \nthe TTT programs and the national and regional networks have been held among ADB staff, TTT \nparticipants, and the international environmental law community. \n \n8.  Environmental law professors and institutions serve as crucial resources and trainers to \nministries of environment, environmental protection agencies, national judiciaries, businesses, \nand NGOs. Moreover, these university-level law educators and institutions are responsible for \neducating future environmental and/or climate change law practitioners and civil servants, policy \nmakers, and judges, who will influence sustainability outcomes in ADB DMCs. If the legal \neducation  system  lacks  the  capacity  to  educate  students  for  these  positions,  then  the \nimplementation, compliance, and enforcement of environmental and climate change laws will \ninevitably be compromised. Consequently, building capacity and networks of university-level \neducators and institutions to improve the teaching and application of environmental and climate \nchange laws has become a critical issue in ADB\u2019s DMCs.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  improved  environmental  governance \ncapabilities of DMCs.19 The TA will have the following outcome: capacity for teaching and \napplication of environmental and climate change laws strengthened to support more effective \nimplementation, compliance, and enforcement in ADB DMCs.20 The TA will also build on results \nand lessons from ADB TA for Strengthening Capacity for Environmental Law in the Asia\u2013Pacific: \nDeveloping Environmental Law Champions, and other TA projects implemented under the Office \nof the General Counsel\u2019s Law and Policy Reform Program.21 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Quality of teaching of environmental and climate change laws improved. \nThe TA will support the design and delivery of in-person TTT programs comprising an overview \nof the core substantive elements of environmental and emerging climate change laws, including \ncoverage of the Paris Agreement and SDGs;22 and teaching methodologies to enhance student \nlearning and interest.23 The in-person TTT programs will be delivered with support from ADB and \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2014.

Manila; Paris Agreement (footnote 1, above); and \ntargets associated with SDGs 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16. \n20 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n21 The TA will complement ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance for Developing Judicial Capacity for Adjudicating Climate \nChange and Sustainable Development Issues. Manila (TA 9279-REG). The main risk identified by that TA is that law \nschools and law curricula fail to train future lawyers and judges in climate change and sustainable development legal \nissues. \n22 The TTT Programs will cover brown issues of air and water pollution and related national laws regarding spatial \nplanning and environmental impact assessment; natural capital covering greens laws and biodiversity, wildlife, \nprotected areas and wetland; blue issues and laws of marine and coastal protection and pollution; natural resources \nlaws;  climate  change  laws  (including  Paris  Agreement);  regional  and  international  environmental  law;  and \nenvironmental and climate change and climate finance dispute resolution. \n23 The teaching of environmental law offers the opportunity to incorporate a wide range of teaching methodologies for \nthe purpose of enhancing student learning and interest, such as role playing, mooting, flipped classrooms, reflective \njournals, field trips, case studies, and small group discussions. \n ", "5 \nthe knowledge partner, and in conjunction with a host institution. The in-person TTT programs are \neffective in training environmental and climate change law champions to lead in-country TTT \nprograms and serve as resource persons and trainers for judges, government officials, private \nsector, and other environmental law practitioners.24 \n \n11.  Output  2:  National, subregional,  and regional  networks  expanded. The TA  will \nconvene  national,  subregional,  and  regional  in-person  and  e-roundtables,  and  support  the \nestablishment of new and the expansion of existing national, subregional, and regional networks \nto foster knowledge sharing and collaboration within and among the DMCs. It is hoped that TA \nsupport for the regional, subregional, and national networks will enable these to be self-sustaining \nupon TA completion. Dialogue regarding the sustainability of national and regional networks to \nensure sustainability of TA-financed activities (including the promotion and improvement of \nteaching of environmental and climate change laws and more effective knowledge sharing) will \nbe included in national and regional roundtables led by in-country focal points, and sustainability \naction plans will be agreed among the various networks by the completion of the TA.25 \n \n12.  Output 3: Knowledge platform to increase national and regional expertise enhanced. \nThe TA will support an enhanced knowledge platform to improve national and regional expertise \nin environmental and climate change laws, which will be hosted on the website developed under \nthe ongoing regional ADB TA (footnote 18). The website will support ongoing learning for TTT \nparticipants  by  (i)  developing  and  providing  e-learning  certificate  programs  to  gain  further \ninstruction on key substantive topics and methodologies not covered during the in-person TTT \nprogram, (ii) providing access to TTT training materials and other teaching resources, and (iii) \nproviding regional and country-specific knowledge resources.26 Materials will be localized and \ntranslated to the extent possible. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000 of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. Host institutions will provide counterpart support in the form of staff time and \nassistance, training venues and/or training materials, and other in-kind contributions. Additional \nfunding sources, including contributions from development partners, are being explored, subject \nto TA implementation progress.27 \n \n                                                \n24 DMCs will be identified on a demand basis in consultation with ADB\u2019s regional departments, resident missions, and \nrelevant ADB sector and thematic groups. Additionally, consultations will be held with the knowledge partner, host \ninstitutions, and development partners such as the United Nations Environment Programme. The selection of DMCs \nwill be prioritized based on submission of proposals under ADB\u2019s TA for Strengthening Capacity for Environmental \nLaw in the Asia\u2013Pacific: Developing Environmental Law Champions (footnote 15), the quality of the proposal, and \nthe capacity of host institution. Participants will be selected based on teaching credentials and demonstration of \ncommitment in teaching environmental and/or emerging climate change laws. \n25 Consultations are being held with the implementing partner (IUCN Academy of Environmental Law) under the existing \nregional ADB TA (footnote 15) and the United Nations Environment Programme on sustainability issues, as well as \nwith country focal points. \n26 Although the e-learning course will be designed primarily for TTT participants, other interested parties from ADB \nDMCs can gain access to the e-learning course. The content and format of the e-learning course will be determined \nafter a needs assessment and consultations with relevant stakeholders. \n27 The current budget is insufficient to meet the demand under the TA, including demand created under the existing \nregional TA (footnote 15). \n ", "6 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will implement the TA from 1 March 2018 to 28 February 2021.28 ADB\u2019s Office of the \nGeneral Counsel will administer the TA. It will carry out TA administration and supervision; \nimplementation oversight; and communication with consultants, the knowledge partner, and \nstakeholders in close coordination with ADB\u2019s operations departments and other sector and \nthematic groups. \n \n15.

The TA will require 12 person-months of consulting services, \ncomprising  3  person-months  of  international  consultant  and  9  person-months  of  national \nconsultant services. ADB may also engage resource persons as needed. ADB will engage \nconsultants on an individual basis following ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and the associated project administration and TA staff instructions.29 ADB will \ndisburse TA proceeds following its Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010 as \namended from time to time). \n \n17.  Knowledge partnership. The International Union for Conservation of Nature Academy of \nEnvironmental Law Ltd. (IUCNAEL) is ADB\u2019s nominated knowledge partner, given their expertise \nin the teaching of environmental and climate change laws, and global network of over 200 \ninstitutions in more than 60 countries involving more than 800 scholars and experts who share a \ncommitment to the advancement of teaching and research in environmental and climate change \nlaws.  Under  the  ongoing  ADB  TA  (footnote  15),  IUCNAEL  has  jointly  contributed  to  the \ndevelopment of the TTT training programs, network building, and knowledge products. Under this \nTA, IUCNAEL will deliver the following outputs: \n \n                                                \n28 The implementation period of this TA will commence following completion of activities under the ongoing ADB TA for \nStrengthening Capacity for Environmental Law in the Asia\u2013Pacific: Developing Environmental Law Champions \n(footnote 15), although consultant recruitment may commence soon after TA approval. \n29 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "7 \n(i)  design and deliver tailored in-person TTT programs to cover environmental and \nclimate  change  laws,  including  substantive  content  and  diverse  teaching \nmethodologies particularly suited to the teaching of environmental and climate \nchange  law,  while  also  taking  into  account  the  country  context,  and  using \nenvironmental and/or climate change law scholars and practitioners with previous \nexperience in the relevant countries; \n(ii)  design  and  convene  national,  subregional,  and/or  regional  in-person  or  e-\nroundtables to foster knowledge-sharing and collaboration within and among the \nnetworks; \n(iii)  support the establishment of new, and the expansion of existing, national and \nsubregional networks, and continue to facilitate the expansion of the established \nregional network; and \n(iv)  develop and provide content for the knowledge platform to increase national and \nregional expertise in environmental and climate change laws and sustainable \ndevelopment issues\u2014including a TTT training manual, TTT teaching resources, \nand  country-specific  and  regional  knowledge  resources\u2014and  where  possible \nassist in translation of the content. \n \nThe detailed outputs and work plan for 2018 are set out in the Knowledge Partnership Agreement. \n \n18.
