INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  the  operations \ndepartments of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) implement the transformative goals of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 by making Water Financing Partnership Facility resources readily accessible to (i) \nprepare and implement innovative projects; (ii) pilot new approaches while bringing them to scale; \nand (iii) help generate and manage knowledge that will result in designing, preparing, and \nimplementing better investment projects.1 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the ADB Management-approved 2019 results-based work plan of \nADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department. The TA will help ADB\u2019s water \nsector operations achieve all Strategy 2030 goals, particularly the following operational priorities \n(OPs):  (i)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience  and  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability (OP3); (ii) making cities more livable (OP4); and (iii) promoting rural \ndevelopment and food security (OP5).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Sector challenges. Asia and the Pacific have seen significant economic growth, but face \nsignificant water challenges, with an estimated population of 5.2 billion by 2050, including an \nestimated 3.4 billion people in water-stressed areas, and an estimated 80% of the region\u2019s water \nresources used for agriculture.3 With rapid urbanization, the region\u2019s water resources will be under \nenormous pressure by 2030.4 Gender inequality remains pervasive: women\u2019s participation in \ndecision-making is limited and the responsibility for collecting water falls largely to women and \ngirls, limiting their education and economic opportunities. Climate and land use changes\u2014which \nincrease extreme weather events and associated water-related disasters\u2014compound these \nchallenges. As a result, water insecurity is prevalent in many developing member countries \n(DMCs) and challenges the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 to ensure \nthe availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.5 \n \n4.  ADB will continue to increase investments and expand its portfolio in the water sector.6 \nDMCs need more assistance to improve water resources management and water services \ndelivery and overcome the obstacles they face, including (i) insufficient infrastructure investments, \n(ii) poor operation and maintenance and asset management, (iii) inadequate formulation and \nimplementation of policies, and (iv) weak institutions and capacity. These obstacles result from a \ncombination of institutional, technical, and financial factors, including lack of enabling environment \nfor  private  sector  investments  and  the  tendency  to  stick  to  traditional  project  design  and \nknowledge gaps. \n \n5.  Integrated  and  innovative  solutions.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  promotes  integrated \nsolutions moving away from a siloed approach. It encourages (i) high-level technology, (ii) \nemerging innovative solutions, (iii) upscaling best practices, and (iv) private sector engagement \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. The Water Financing Partnership Facility was established in November 2006 to provide additional financial \nand knowledge resources from development partners to help implement ADB\u2019s water financing program. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 November 2019. \n3   ADB. 2016. Asian Water Development Outlook 2016. Manila. \n4  Asian Water Development Outlook 2016 categorized 29 DMCs as water insecure (footnote 3). \n5  SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. United Nations. 2015. \nTransforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. New York. \n6  In 2018, ADB committed a total of 42 water projects for a value of about $3.4 billion. The pipeline for 2019 includes \n47 projects, for an estimate of $4.2 billion. The portfolio covers all the water subsectors. \n ", "2 \nthat will help meet the region\u2019s water challenges. To enable this integrated and multisectoral \nparadigm shift, ADB\u2019s operations must better collaborate across water sector divisions and \nenhance cooperation among departments, Office of Public\u2013Private Partnerships, and Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department. ADB operations departments will also enhance \ncooperation  with  the  Independent  Evaluation  Department  to  link  evaluation  lessons  and \nrecommendations into the design of new projects. \n \n6.  Strategy 2030\u2019s operational plans call for upscaling best practices and adopting emerging \ninnovative solutions to meet the region\u2019s water challenges. For OP3, these include (i) enhanced \nefforts to address water quality, water productivity, and integrated water resources management; \n(ii) strengthening the linkages between water, food and energy; and (iii) enabling integrated \nsolutions.7 For OP4, holistic solutions are key, including smart water management, a sponge cities \napproach for flood management, nature-based solutions, and inclusive sanitation to cover both \nnetworked and non-networked systems.8 For OP5, ensuring food security will require improved \nproductivity through modernization of irrigation systems, including automated control systems, \nwater reuse, micro irrigation and pressurized piped irrigation.9  Remote-sensing, drone, and smart \nphone applications need upscaling. \n \n7.  ADB assistance and value addition. The TA builds on the good practices and lessons \nlearned from the predecessor regional TA10 which include: (i) making additional grant resources \navailable to operations departments to engage with DMC governments in developing stronger \npipeline of water investments; (ii) supporting sector policy dialogue to inform institutional reforms \nin DMCs; (iii) pilot testing new and/or innovative concepts, approaches, strategies and business \nmodels, including new technologies, to facilitate dissemination of emerging innovations and newer \nthinking; (iv) promoting peer-to-peer learning and practitioner-focused technical training following \nthe model of the Water Operators Partnerships (WOPs) Program; and (v) increasing knowledge \nbase through analytical work, research, and collaboration with knowledge partners to inform \nADB\u2019s water operations.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: availability and sustainable management of \nwater and sanitation ensured for all (SDG 6).11 The TA will have the following outcome: knowledge \nand capacity for water resources management and water services delivery in DMCs improved.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1. Project design and implementation support, and pilot and demonstration \nactivities provided.

Manila \n(TA 6498-REG) will close in December 2020 and activities are targeted to be completed no later than September \n2020. Having this new TA in place before 2020 will facilitate smoother transition and uninterrupted support to \noperations departments. \n11 United Nations. 2015. Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. New York. \n12 The design and monitoring framework is Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \noperations departments on demand through specialists\u2019 inputs and/or other services, starting from \nupstream  work  (pre-concept  phase)  all  the  way  through  transaction  TA  and  project \nimplementation.  The  TA  will  supplement  complex  and  innovative  projects  that  require \ncomplementary technical, policy and institutional support from  expert inputs. The scope of \nspecialists\u2019 services will cover the five Water Sector Group activities: (i) supplying water, (ii) water \nquality and sanitation, (iii) water for food, (iv) water for energy, (v) water resources management, \nand (vi) disaster risk reduction. It will also cover the following crosscutting issues: (i) promoting \ninclusiveness and health, (ii) governance and sustainability, (iii) financing and transactions, (iv) \ndisaster and resilience, (v) high-level technology, and (v) integration and water-food-energy nexus.   \n \n10.  TA resources will also be directed at pilot and demonstration activities (PDAs) of less than \n$75,000  to  test  and  validate  innovative  concepts,  strategies,  business  models,  and  new \ntechnologies, including applied research that can be replicated and scaled up.13 As experience \nshows, PDAs serve as a quick-response mechanism for operations departments when the need \nto test something on the ground arises for which there is no readily available instrument. PDAs \ncan support operations departments through (i) design options during project development; (ii) \ninnovative  solutions  during  project  implementation;  (iii)  engagement  with  government \ncounterparts and other stakeholders; and (iv) stimulating development of new investments. \n \n11.  Results of PDIS and PDAs will be documented for sharing across operations departments \nto support preparation and implementation of future projects. \n \n12.  Output  2.  Knowledge  management,  strategic  collaborations,  and  capacity \ndevelopment supported. Output 2 will strengthen ADB\u2019s role as a knowledge partner, including \nby (i) enhancing knowledge management to help capture ADB\u2019s tacit operational knowledge and \nshare lessons with DMCs through knowledge products in accessible formats and (2) promoting \nDMC peer-to-peer learning. To develop knowledge products, the TA will deliberately select project \nlessons that provide good practices for replication. It will also include analytical work such as \nADB\u2019s flagship publication (Asian Water Development Outlook), and the development of print and \nnon-print knowledge products, including video blogs, web-based materials, and social media. The \nTA  will  optimize  the  Water  Sector  Group  community  site  on  SharePoint  to  increase  the \nsustainability of knowledge-sharing platforms after TA completion. The TA will also help prepare \nADB flagship events and actively participate in partner-organized events in collaboration with \noperations departments and in-country workshops and conferences to help share knowledge on \na demand basis and disseminate practical knowledge within ADB.14 To complement ADB\u2019s \nknowledge and capacity, the TA will support strategic collaborations with partners using various \nmodalities to share expertise, including continuous learning and development activities for ADB \nand DMC staff.15 The TA will support capacity-building activities to complement projects or TA \nprojects, such as peer-to-peer learnings, twinning partnerships, and the WOPs program. \n \n \n13 PDAs started in 2002 under the Water Financing Partnership Facility\u2019s predecessor, the Cooperation Fund for the \nWater Sector, and they have been sustained under Water Financing Partnership Facility and TA 6498. Examples of \nPDA results that benefited ADB\u2019s in-country work include (i) improved policy for tariff setting in the Philippines; (ii) \nmobilization of communities for sanitation, hygiene, and river cleanup in the People\u2019s Republic of China; and (iii) \nempowerment of women and disadvantaged farmers in Nepal. To date, the Water Financing Partnership Facility has \nsupported a total of 63 PDAs.  \n14 ADB flagship events include the Asia Water Forum, Asian Irrigation Forum, Asian Sanitation Dialogue, and \nRoundtable on Financing Water. Partner-organized events include Stockholm World Water Week, World Water \nForum, International Fecal Sludge Management Conference, Asia International Water Week, Singapore International \nWater Week, International River Symposium, and Asia\u2013Pacific Water Summit. \n15 Asia-Netherlands Water Learning Week, ADB\u2013Australia Water Learning Week, and other technical trainings. \n \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000, of which (i) $250,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund; and (ii) $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the \nNetherlands Trust Fund, both under the Water Financing Partnership Facility and administered \nby ADB.16 Key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA.  The Water Sector Group under the Sector Advisory Service \nCluster of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will carry out TA \nadministration  and  supervise  implementation  in  close  collaboration  with  the  Water  Sector \nCommittee, operations departments including ADB resident missions, and other sector and \nthematic groups. \n \n15.

ADB will consider \noutput-based or lump-sum contracts for consulting services, where appropriate, with the concurrence of ADB's \nProcurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department. \n ", "5 \nspecialists  may  be  requested for  one  project or  activity.  Projects  requiring  more than two \nspecialists can be funded directly from the Water Financing Partnership Facility through the direct \ncharge modality or a TA. Proposals may be submitted any time using a proposal template \ndeveloped under ADB\u2019s regional TA for Knowledge and Innovation Support for ADB\u2019s Water \nFinancing Program. Following approval of funding, the user division may proceed to engage \nspecialists. \n \n17.  Pilot testing of project approach. PDAs may involve selecting consultants, procuring \ngoods and works, and collaborating with partners. PDAs should be directly linked to project \npreparation or implementation. Proposals may be submitted any time using the existing PDA \nproposal template. The maximum amount for each proposal is $75,000 and the maximum \nimplementation period is 12 months. ADB staff will be the PDA proponents and hence will be \nresponsible for procurement, management, and progress reporting on the activities, including a \nPDA completion report summarizing findings and recommendations on the potential for replication \nand scaling up. For PDAs that involve civil works, all permits and clearances that may be required \nshall be the responsibility of the government recipient of the TA funds. ADB staff submitting PDA \napplications  that  involve  civil  works  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  the  memorandum  of \nunderstanding between ADB and the government that stipulates the responsibility, among others, \nof the government recipient for securing permits and clearances and arranging the treatment of \nassets. Following PDA approval, commencement of civil works will be allowed only after the \nmemorandum of understanding has been signed and issues associated with permits and licenses \nhave been resolved. Assets procured under the PDA shall be turned over to the government upon \ncompletion of the pilot project. PDAs involving partners should cost-share so that partnering \ninstitutions bear a portion of the project cost, which may be in-kind (including experts\u2019 cost, land, \noffice space, labor). Every PDA should develop a knowledge product to the degree possible. \nThese activities will not result in any potential adverse environmental and/or social impacts. \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s procurement. The procurement method to be used for goods and/or works is \ncompetitive bidding. Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).18 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $1,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust Fund; and (ii) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund, both under the Water Financing Partnership Facility \nfor Achieving Water Sector Priorities in Asia and the Pacific under Strategy 2030, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n18 Procurement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nAvailability and sustainable management of water and sanitation ensured for all (Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 6)a \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Risks \nwith Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms \nOutcome  By 2024 (for all indicators):     \n       \nKnowledge and  a.
