INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB)  recent  Country  Diagnostics  Study,  identifies \nweaknesses in governance and institutions  as a critical development constraint, undermining \nboth economic growth and poverty reduction. In response, ADB's strategic governance and anti-\ncorruption  program  in  Indonesia  is  focused  on  public  financial  management,  including  the \ndevelopment  of  Indonesia's  key  institutions,  the  building  of  country  systems  and  the \nmainstreaming of capacity development.  At the forefront of this program is ADB's support to the \nestablishment and institutionalization of international procurement practices at both the country \nand project implementation levels through support  of the National Public Procurement Agency \n(NPPA).  \n \n2.  ADB has provided the following assistance to the Government of Indonesia to improve \nthe public procurement sector:1 (i) developing recommendations for revisions to civil service \nregulations to establish a system of certification that incorporated provisions to recognize civil \nservants  who  pursue  a  career  in  procurement;  (ii)  producing  better  national  regulation  of \nprocurement, presidential regulation (keputusan presiden or keppres) 80/2003, to replace the \nold keppres 18/2000; (iii) issuing a national standard bidding document; and (iv) producing a \nlegal framework for the establishment of a sole institution, the National Public Procurement \nAgency (NPPA), with a mandate to enforce public procurement policy. The government has \nasked ADB to continue supporting ongoing public procurement reform. \n \n3.  The proposed technical assistance (TA)2 is listed in ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan for 2009.3  ADB undertook a fact-finding mission from 27\u201328 January 2010 to design the \nTA.  The mission reached an understanding with the government on the TA\u2019s objectives, scope, \ncosts and financing plan, implementation arrangements, and counterpart support. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Procurement reform in Indonesia was initiated in 1999. It is a key factor in reducing state \nbudget leakage, and is intended to enhance the transparency of the public procurement system. \nThe reform is also aimed at improving the integrity and accountability of the public procurement \nsystem through an effective and efficient procurement process. \n \n5.  Since decentralization in 2004, the environment of the national development program \nhas  changed.  Regional  governments  have  been  given  the  authority  to  manage  their  own \nbudgets for public spending. In fiscal year (FY) 2009, 40% of the state budget for public \nspending4 was provided to regional governments. This has played a significant role in service \ndelivery, especially since about 80% of the budget was spent through public procurement \nmechanisms.  \n \n6.  The  Decentralization  Law  and  other  regulations  allow  local  governments  and  other \ngovernment institutions to introduce their own procurement procedures, which often differ from \neach other. Consequently, the various procurement processes have resulted in unpredictable \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Strengthening Procurement Policies, \nLegal Framework, and Institution. Manila (TA 3720-INO). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 May 2010. \n3  ADB. 2009. Country Operations Business Plan: Indonesia, 2010-2012. Manila. \n4  Source: Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara, (APBN), www.fiskal.depkeu.go.id. \n ", "2   \noutputs.  According  to  Indonesia\u2019s  Commission  for  the  Eradication  of  Corruption  (Komisi \nPemberantasan  Korupsi),  potentially  about  Rp36  trillion  or  about  30%  of  the  procurement \nbudget is lost due to corruption each year.5 This is likely due to the absence of a set of uniform \nnational regulations for public sector procurement. The lack of such regulations is considered a \nmajor constraint on the government in ensuring satisfactory use of the state budget and delivery \nof quality public services. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a national standard for the \nprocurement of goods, works, and services that would provide a foundation for economic, \nefficient, transparent, and predictable processes. This would help to achieve effective use of the \nstate  budget  and  delivery  of  quality  public  services,  and,  at  the  same  time,  reduce  the \nopportunities for fraud, corruption, and other illegal acts. \n \n7.  On 6 December 2007, the government issued Presidential Regulation 106 to establish \nthe National Public Procurement Agency (NPPA). The regulation mandates the NPPA as the \nonly government institution responsible for (i) developing a national procurement policy and \nstrategy; (ii) developing systems to support the delivery of procurement services; (iii) monitoring \nand  evaluating  the  performance  and  delivery  of  procurement  services;  (iv)  developing  an \nadequate  supply  of  qualified  human  resources,  including  certified  procurement  staff;  (v) \ndeveloping the NPPA as the principal source of legal; professional; and technical advice; and \nsupporting  practitioners  on  all  procurement-related  matters;  and  (vi)  establishing  an \nindependent procurement complaints and dispute resolution body.  \n \n8.  However, the NPPA is still in its infancy, and Presidential Regulation 106 is not yet \nmandatory for all government ministries and agencies and state-owned enterprises. A number \nof basic policies and procedures for an enforceable procurement system are not clearly defined \nin  any  procurement  decrees  or  regulations.  The  various  applicable  laws,  decrees,  and \nregulations create confusion due to overlapping jurisdictions.   \n \n9.  To  respond  to  the  above  challenges,  the  NPPA  must  develop  into  an  effective \norganization  with  a  transparent  and  accountable  system  and  with  adequate  capacity,  i.e., \norganization  and  personnel.  Through  this  institution-building,  the  NPPA\u2019s  role  as  the  only \ninstitution  responsible  for  developing  and  formulating  government  procurement  policy  for \nnationwide implementation will eventually be strengthened. This objective must be supported by \na more robust legal framework6 than Presidential Regulation 106, and will be achieved through \n(i) the development of government regulations (peraturan pemerintah) that will compel  all \ngovernment administrations nationwide to use a standardized procurement system, and (ii) the \nestablishment of an accountable and transparent procurement system.  \n \n10.  By enforcing the use of a nationwide standardized procurement system, fiduciary risk \nmanagement would be improved, while the opportunities for corruption or collusion between \npublic officials and vendors would be significantly reduced. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be improved transparency and efficiency in public procurement \nto promote good governance. The TA will help the government to examine the current policies \n                                                 \n5  Source: http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/news/article.php?storyid=401 \n6  In order of hierarchy, law (undang undang) is the highest legal framework, followed by government regulation \n(peraturan pemerintah) and presidential regulation (peraturan presiden [perpres], which was originally called \nkeppres [presidential regulation]). \n ", "  3\nand procedures, and update and revise the regulations, as necessary, in accordance with sound \ninternational standard practices and other appropriate procurement procedures and practices. \n \n12.  The outcome of the TA will be a strengthened NPPA in its role as the lead agency for \npublic procurement reform. \n \n13.  The key outputs of the TA will be (i) improvement of the NPPA\u2019s institutional capacity; (ii) \nbetter-trained  and  more  professional  procurement  personnel;  (iii)  improvement  of  public \nawareness of NPPA roles and outputs; and (iv) operationalization of integrated national e-\nprocurement system.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA outputs will be achieved through the following activities: \n \n1.  Improving Capacity Development \n15.  Output 1: Improvement of the NPPA\u2019s institutional capacity. The aim is to support \nthe strengthening and maintenance of the NPPA\u2019s institutional capabilities. The activity will \ninvolve (i) analysis of the country\u2019s public procurement system, including the legal framework, \norganizational  responsibilities,  and  public  procurement  procedures  and  practices;  (ii) \nassessment of institutional and organizational capacity in the procurement process; and (iii) \ndevelopment  of  a  procurement  capacity  strategy,  including  an  action  plan  for  institutional \nimprovement.  ADB\u2019s  Central  Operations  Services  Office,  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, and Controller\u2019s Department will help coordinate the implementation \nof  the  relevant  capacity-building  initiatives,  which  will  be  aligned  with  the  outcome  from \nconsultants on the development of the NPPA\u2019s comprehensive organization strategy, including \na business plan and in-depth institutional analysis. \n \n16.  Output 2: Better-trained and more professional procurement personnel. The aim is \nto  strengthen  the  professional  skills  of  public  procurement  practitioners  nationwide. \nDecentralization has had a significant impact on the number, type, and institutions involved in \nprocurement, which have multiplied along with the number of regional governments. This has \nalso  affected  the  skills  of  procurement  staff,  i.e.,  higher  skill  levels  are  required  with  the \nchanging environment, while the level of experience is dwindling due to decentralization. There \nis,  therefore,  an  urgent  need  to  increase  public  procurement  practitioners\u2019  implementation \ncapacity, in particular the capacity of regional governments, which is currently limited. The \nactivity will support the capacity building of procurement personnel. This will include (i) providing \ntraining and certification programs in procurement for government officials, (ii) developing a \nbroader  curriculum  and  international  standard  qualifications,  (iii)  involving  educational \ninstitutions  in  formalizing  the  profession,  and  (iv)  establishing  a  procurement  professional \nnetwork for oversight and development purposes. \n \n2.  Improving Fiduciary Risk Management \n17.  Ouput 3: Improvement of public awareness of NPPA roles and outputs. The aim is \nto improve the current website to support effective and efficient delivery of public procurement \ninformation  to  the  general  public.  The  current  website  will  be  improved  to  support  the \ndissemination of public procurement initiatives, progress, and opportunities. This will enhance \npublic awareness of all aspects of the procurement process, including the role of the NPPA. The \nwebsite will also support the national e-procurement system and its nationwide implementation, \n ", "4   \nincluding an English version for international bidding procedures as well as to showcase the \nsystem to the international community. \n18.  Output 4: Operationalization of the integrated national e-procurement system. This \nactivity will support the deployment of a single, standard national e-procurement system. The \ncurrent system will be improved to fully integrate with an oversight and monitoring system, and \naudit and evaluation system, among others. The enhancement of the system will also increase \nthe  capacity  of  users  to  navigate  the  web-based  procurement  system.  With  system \nimprovements,  procurement  information  should  become  easily  accessible,  thus  increasing \ntransparency, competitiveness, and efficiency. The enhanced system will enable monitoring of \nall phases in each procurement transaction, which will reduce any potential fraud, corruption, or \nother illegal acts. In addition, the improved system will be easily auditable, as audit trails on \neach procurement transaction will be created and archived. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,110,000 equivalent, of which $1,000,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, to be administered by \nADB. The main elements to be funded are the services of international and national consultants, \nequipment, and workshops and seminars. The government will contribute $110,000 equivalent \nin-kind through the provision of office space, counterpart staff support, administrative services, \nand physical facilities. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  Institutional arrangements. The NPPA will be the executing agency. The NPPA was \nchosen because of its mandate to develop a national procurement policy and strategy. The \nNPPA will coordinate with the team leader and project coordinator in supervising and managing \nthe day-to-day TA activities. ADB will coordinate with the NPPA to ensure the timely delivery of \noutputs and the regular submission of reports from the consultants in accordance with the terms \nof reference.  \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, beginning in November 2010. ADB will field \nregular missions to review implementation progress and guide the consultants (in consultation \nwith the NPPA). These missions will provide appropriate recommendations to the NPPA, if \nnecessary, and will take actions to facilitate TA implementation to meet its objectives. \n \n22.  A team of international and national consultants will implement the TA activities. All \nconsultants will be recruited as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time), using arrangements satisfactory to ADB, and will be \nhanded over to the government upon completion of the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  5\nIV.
