INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2017  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  programming  mission  to \nPakistan, the Government of Pakistan requested that ADB provide knowledge and support \ntechnical assistance (TA) to the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform for preparing the \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan, which focuses on promoting efficient growth and connectivity, including \nthrough economic corridor development (ECD).1 ADB and the government initially agreed on (i) \nthe TA objective of helping the government with ECD to achieve sustained and inclusive growth, \nand (ii) key areas to be covered by the TA: (a) an ECD policy and operational framework to \nsupport Pakistan\u2019s participation in global value chains and enhance its competitiveness;2 and (b) \nanalytical tools and feasibility studies for ECD identification, design, and implementation.3 In the \nfollow-up meetings between the government and ADB, the government reaffirmed the key areas \nof focus and suggested the need for additional assistance regarding industrial policy, special \neconomic zones, and an ECD hub for knowledge generation and sharing. It was agreed that ADB \nwill draw on its internal expertise and resources to address these challenges. \n \n2.  The TA will contribute to the key knowledge products of the ADB Pakistan Resident \nMission  to  support  overall  ADB  operations  in  Pakistan,  as  described  in  the  ADB  country \npartnership strategy for Pakistan, 2015\u20132019, with the objective of achieving higher and more \ninclusive growth.4 The TA is included in the ADB country operations business plan for Pakistan, \n2018\u20132020 as a follow-up to a small\u2013scale policy and advisory TA project for Scoping Potential \nEconomic Corridors in Pakistan,5 and will support development of the subsequent ADB country \npartnership strategy for Pakistan (for 2020\u20132024) and country operations business plans. The TA \nis  part  of  the  Pakistan  Economic  Corridors  Programme\u2014financed  by  the  Department  for \nInternational Development of the Government of the United Kingdom (DFID) and jointly delivered \nby ADB and DFID\u2014to promote regional trade and connectivity. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Pakistan has experienced steady growth recovery in 2015\u20132017, with gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth of 5.3% in FY2016. Although very encouraging, the growth remains modest \nand insufficient to create jobs for the large number of youth (about 3 million) joining the labor force \neach year, and far below the growth path that some countries have followed in becoming strong \nmiddle-income countries. Stronger growth is also essential to further reduce poverty and improve \nthe lives of the poor, who number about 60 million. The government\u2019s long-term development \ngoal, as reflected in its Pakistan Vision 2025, is to achieve upper middle-income status by \nincreasing per capita income to $4,200 by 2025, from the current level of about $1,600.6 Achieving \nthis goal requires higher, more sustained, and inclusive economic growth of at least 7% per year. \n \n4.  Pakistan\u2019s  increased  growth  in  FY2016  was  mainly  driven  by  consumption,  with  a \ncontinued low level of investment7 caused by perceived security issues, energy shortages, and a \n                                                \n1  ADB first used the term \u201ceconomic corridor\u201d in 1998 to describe a planned development in a given space; the concept \nemerged in the early 1990s via ADB\u2019s Greater Mekong Subregion project and Europe\u2019s Maastricht Treaty.  \n2  An economic corridor involves the creation of an efficient multimodal transport network within a defined area, \nsupported by quality infrastructure and logistics, and with a policy framework that facilitates doing business. It \nincludes setting up distribution networks that link production centers, urban clusters, and international gateways. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 November 2017. \n4  ADB. 2014.

Islamabad. \n7  The ratio of investment to GDP is 15.6%, compared with the average of 34% for South Asia during 2010\u20132015. \n ", "2 \npoor business regulatory environment.8 Growth acceleration needs a better alignment between \nnational plans and policies and provincial operational priorities, and joint actions between federal \nand provincial governments. All sectors should benefit from ECD that improves infrastructure, the \nbusiness climate, and investment. ECD is more than special economic zones, export processing \nzones, and industrial parks, for it includes the infrastructure, industrial and urban developments \nto connect producers and consumers by providing good economic networks. ECD is a well-proven \ngrowth instrument that could move Pakistan into a higher growth trajectory. Empirical evidence \nacross countries supports the positive impact of ECD.9   \n \n5.  Declining exports also pose a development challenge. Pakistan has lost 1.45% in export \nmarket share per year in 2007\u20132017 due to weakening export competitiveness and soft global \ndemand in key sectors. Food and textiles remain Pakistan\u2019s main exports, but they continue to \nsuffer from declining prices and demand, as well as from poor trade facilitation, inadequate \ninvestment, low diversification, inefficient logistics, and poor investment climate. Pakistan has \nalso lagged behind its competitors in terms of trade openness. For example, the simple average \ntariff has fallen only slightly, from 14.4% in FY2013 to 13.4% in FY2016. Moreover, 80% of global \ntrade is currently carried out through global value chains. Therefore, it is vital for Pakistan to \nimprove its trade competitiveness.  \n \n6.  ECD has contributed to and been influenced by regional and global trades and market \nintegration. ECD expansion in Asia in the last few years was driven by rapid increases in global \nvalue chains. Successful ECD is therefore contingent upon investments and policy incentives. \nECD and trade facilitation are important in Pakistan, as the country has concern on export and its \nsubsequent  impacts  on  foreign  reserves.  Reforms  in  policy,  institutional  mechanisms,  and \nincentives are needed to remove FDI bottlenecks and facilitate private sector investment to \npromote productivity, trade and further ECD. \n \n7.  At the regional and global levels, Pakistan is actively participating in Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) program and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),10 in which the \nChina\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is the central project. Both the CAREC and CPEC \nprojects provide a strong foundation for ECD in Pakistan by providing regional and international \neconomic linkages that would have otherwise be developed by Pakistan.  \n \n8.  The TA  aims  to  assist  Pakistan  to  realize  the  potential  of  ECD  to boost  industrial \nproductivity,  exports,  and  job  creation  and  thereby  contribute  to  sustained,  increased  and \nequitable economic growth. The key focus of the TA is to (i) further study the corridors to be \nincluded in the TA scope; (ii) enhance the value chain development program along the corridors; \nand (iii) strengthen strategies and strategic frameworks, policies, institutions, and coordination for \nECD, including by promoting the role of the private sector, strengthening capacity, and learning \nfrom best practices. The TA will examine efficient connections between domestic and international \nproduction networks and markets, domestic connectivity to connect lagging districts (including \nsecondary  cities  and  rural  areas)  with  urban  growth  poles  to  unleash  growth  potential  by \nincreasing trade competitiveness, reducing poverty, and strengthening Pakistan\u2019s regional and \nglobal competitiveness.  \n                                                \n8  Pakistan ranks 147th out of 190 countries in the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business survey.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: more integrated economic development \nresulting in better resource allocation, and higher and more inclusive growth in line with the \ngovernment\u2019s growth aspirations and Pakistan Vision 2025. The TA will have the following \noutcome: better planned ECD resulting in more investments and increased economic activity. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA will help address the following basic \nproblems: (i) a lack of synergy in development policies and programs across districts and \nprovinces; (ii) institutional, policy, and governance inefficiencies; (iii) lack of implementation plans; \nand (iv) poor trade competitiveness and facilitation. The TA will help address lagging and \nfragmented  economic  development  across  sectors,  districts  and  provinces  and  a  lack  of \nconnection with global trade and production networks to increase Pakistan\u2019s competitiveness, \nexports, GDP, and productivity. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n10.  Output  1:  Economic  corridor  development  policy  and  operational  framework \ndeveloped in line with best practice. Regional and global best practices will be tailored to fit \nthe Pakistan context. ECD requires supportive institutional and regulatory frameworks conducive \nto entrepreneurship and private investment. Under output 1, the TA will (i) collect international \nbest practices and successful modes and case studies;11 (ii) prepare tangible models of ECD \nplanning,  development,  financing,  management,  and  operations;  (iii)  undertake  a  detailed \ndiagnosis for ECD in Pakistan;12 and (iv) develop an integrated institutional, policy, and regulatory \nframework for ECD. \n \n11.  Output 2: Economic corridor development feasibility studies and analytical tools \ndeveloped. The feasibility studies will demonstrate the application of best practices and establish \na benchmark for key ECD components, including assessments of demand for targeted industries; \nanalyses on industrial land market price and land pricing strategy; the suitability of an area to \nsupport targeted industries with the required infrastructure and amenities; a financial model of \ncosts and revenue streams with a sensitivity analysis; and economic impact analyses on job \ncreation, export demand, and other benefits. Moreover, a user-friendly analytical tool13 will be \ndeveloped to support better planning and prioritization, provide scenario analyses, determine \noptimum locations, and trace likely impacts across districts and industries. \n \n12.  Output 3: Pakistan economic corridor development hub developed. The hub is a \nprofessional network to facilitate ECD knowledge generation and dissemination to tap the best \nexperts and latest knowledge for capacity building and decision-making. The virtual hub and ECD \nnetwork will build linkages among the government, businesses, and think thanks.14 \n \n                                                \n11 Special focus would be on Malaysia, PRC and others, such as in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n12 Includes land use regulations, policies for investment-friendly and efficient provision of labor and capital, utilities, a \nstreamlined tax system, simplified business procedures, and other investment and business facilitation programs. \n13 Such as the webGIS (geographic information system) application. \n14 Including the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform; Board of Investment; Ministry of Industries and \nProduction; Ministry of Commerce; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Water and Power; Ministry of Petroleum and \nNatural Resources; Ministry of Communications; provincial governments of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, \nand Baluchistan; and the National Industrial Parks Development and Management Company. \n ", "4 \n13.  Output  4:  Strategic  policy  framework  for  improving  trade  competitiveness \ndeveloped. Trade competitiveness is a fundamental driver of economic growth and increased \ncompetitiveness will likely result in more rapid economic growth. To develop the framework, the \nTA will identify and address key policy gaps hampering Pakistan\u2019s domestic and international \ncompetitiveness  by  examining  12  factors  that  affect  Pakistan\u2019s  productivity  and  economic \nprosperity: institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, health and primary education, \nhigher  education  and  training,  market  efficiency  for  goods  and  labor,  financial  market \ndevelopment, technological readiness, market size, business sophistication, and innovation.15 \n \n14.  Methodology  and  key  activities.  The  TA  will  consult  key  stakeholders,  do  some \nassessments and analyses, conduct research studies and develop (i) ECD policy and operational \nframework, (ii) ECD feasibility studies and analytical tools,  (iii) Pakistan ECD hub, and (iv) \nstrategic policy framework for improving trade competitiveness. Domestic field research could \ninclude visits to more advanced and developed provinces, and policy dialogue. International field \nresearch could include visits to countries with rich experience in ECD. Specifics regarding these \nvisits would depend on research requirements, with preference given to ADB member countries. \nMoreover, seminars with press conference by involving policy makers and renowned experts from \nrelevant countries, could be conducted to help share international experience and TA results. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,418,081, all of which will be financed on a grant basis by \nDFID of the Government of the United Kingdom. ADB will administer the TA. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in the forms  of counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office \nsupplies, relevant data and information, assistance in arranging meetings and field visits with \nrelevant  government  agencies,  logistics  support,  and  other  in-kind  contributions  that  are \nestimated about not more than 15% of the total cost. Key expenditure items are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The executing agency will be the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform, which \nwill also serve as the implementing agency for output 1; implementing agencies for the other \noutputs will be the Punjab\u2019s Urban Unit (output 2), selected think tanks (output 3) and the Ministry \nof Commerce (output 4). The implementation arrangement is summarized in Table 1. \n \n17.  The TA will be conducted in 30 months. Priority for field research will be given to potential \neconomic  corridors  already  identified  and  discussed  with  the  government.16 Expertise  and \nresources from across ADB will be tapped to work as \u201cOne ADB\u201d, with departments working \ntogether to examine key issues relating to ECD.  \n \n18.  Consulting services. A total of 44 person-months of individual consulting services (two \ninternational consultants for 14 person-months and three national consultants for 30 person-\nmonths) will be provided using lumpsum output-based contracts. International and/or local firms \nwill be mobilized to mainly carry out feasibility studies on ECD, developing analytical tools, and \nestablishing ECD Hub. It is important that the TA be implemented in a flexible manner. Therefore, \nthe TORs, duration, and schedule of TA inputs will be adjusted as necessary. Such adjustments \nmay also be undertaken during implementation to better meet capacity building needs and to \n                                                \n15 World  Economic  Forum.
