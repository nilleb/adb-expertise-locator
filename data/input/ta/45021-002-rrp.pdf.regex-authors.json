I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Anhui  Intermodal  Sustainable  Transport \nProject.1 \n2.  The  project  will  (i)  upgrade  sections  of  provincial  and  national  highways  in  Anhui \nProvince and improve the safety features on these roads; (ii) develop new highway sections \ndesigned to support public and nonmotorized transport (NMT); (iii) improve the capacity of the \nprovince\u2019s  inland  waterway  network,  (iv)  construct  an  intermodal  inland  river  port  on  the \nupgraded inland water channel, and (v) strengthen institutional capacity for road and inland \nwater transport (IWT).2 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Development in the central PRC province of Anhui has lagged behind that in neighboring \neastern and coastal provinces. About 56% of the province\u2019s 59.7 million people lived in rural \nareas in 2011, but population density, at 430 inhabitants per square kilometer, is much higher \nthan the national average (138) and land availability is limited. Despite economic growth, the \nprovince\u2019s gross domestic product per capita remains much lower than those of the adjacent \ncoastal provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.3 Anhui has had some success in its efforts to \ncapitalize on the advantages of its physical proximity to these more affluent provinces owing to \nits large, skilled, and less costly labor force. It is gradually attracting new investments and \nmaintained  double-digit  annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  during  2011\u20132012. \nProduction has grown faster than the national average, and Anhui\u2019s consumption per capita \nreached 77% of the national average in 2011, up from 70% in 2005. \n4.  To harness Anhui\u2019s geographical advantage and cost competitiveness and promote new \ninvestment in manufacturing and services, the PRC State Council approved a plan in January \n2010 to create the Wanjiang Demonstration Zone (WDZ). The plan aims to attract equipment \nmanufacturing, textile, information technology, and agricultural industries to the urbanized areas \nalong the Wanjiang River, which is the name given to the stretch of the Yangtze River that flows \nthrough Anhui. The WDZ covers fifty nine counties and nine cities, including Hefei and Wuhu, \nand  is  expected  to facilitate the  expansion  of existing  Anhui-based  companies  as  well  as \nencourage companies to relocate from elsewhere in the Yangtze River Delta, including Anhui\u2019s \nneighboring provinces. \n5.  The city of Xuancheng is the nearest point in the WDZ to the Yangtze River Delta, and \nborders Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Only 283 kilometers (km) west of the city of Shanghai, \nit is the closest major center in the WDZ, making  it a favorable destination for industries \nrelocating from the coast. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank provided technical assistance to help prepare the project. ADB. 2011. Technical \nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Anhui Intermodal Sustainable Transport Project. Manila. \n3  In 2011\u20132012, Anhui had a GDP per capita of $4,200, much lower than those of the adjacent provinces of Jiangsu \n($11,000) and Zhejiang ($10,200). ", "2 \n \n6.  Xuancheng  is  developing  an  industrial  park  to  capitalize  on  Anhui\u2019s  comparative \nadvantages and to attract industries that are seeking to move from neighboring provinces.4 For \nthe city and the WDZ to succeed in these efforts, however, the Xuancheng industrial park and \nthe WDZ need to be served by a well-developed transport network. \n7.  Anhui\u2019s inadequate transport network is currently a major obstacle to rapid industrial and \neconomic development and, as a result, to poverty reduction. The capacity and quality of the \nprovince\u2019s roads need significant improvement to meet growing requirements and to link Anhui \nto the Yangtze River corridor. Most roads have only two lanes and some should be upgraded to \nfour or six. Of the 149,535 km of roads at the end of 2011, expressways and high-standard \nclass I and II highways comprised only 9.5% (14,276 km), which is lower than the national \naverage of 11.5%. The percentage of paved roads provides an indication of the general quality \nof the road infrastructure, and in Anhui this is lower than in the six surrounding provinces \n(44.2%). \n8.  Any  expansion  of  the  province\u2019s  road  network  must  be  accompanied  by  carefully \ndesigned  measures  to  enhance  the  level  of  road  safety  and  prevent  traffic  accidents. \nParticularly  important  is  the  need for  road  designs to  contribute  to the  safety  of  NMT  by \nproviding segregated pedestrian and cycling lanes. An estimated 210,000 crashes led to 62,000 \ntraffic fatalities in the PRC in 2011, making road safety a national concern. Accidents and \ninjuries have risen rapidly along with the expansion of the road network and the growth in the \nnumber  of  motor  vehicles.  During  2000\u20132005,  more  than  600,000  people  were  killed  and \naround 3 million injured in crashes\u2014equivalent to a fatality every 5 minutes. These accidents \nare estimated to have affected the lives of more than 20 million people in the country, either \ndirectly  or  as  family  members  of  the  victims  involved.  The  most  vulnerable  road  users\u2014\npedestrians, motorcyclists, and cyclists\u2014account for the majority of deaths. \n9.  Like  the  PRC  in  general,  Anhui  has  great  potential  for  the  development  of  inland \nwaterway transport (IWT), which is clean, safe, and the most energy-efficient of all the major \nmodes of transport. The PRC has more than 5,600 navigable rivers and an inland waterway \nsystem of 119,000 km in total navigable length. IWT can provide a cost-effective alternative to \nroad  transport  for  moving  freight,  and  thereby  help  alleviate  the  traffic  congestion  on  the \ncountry\u2019s highways, reduce energy consumption, and avoid rapidly growing emissions that are \nexacerbating local air pollution and contributing to global climate change. Despite recent fast \ngrowth, IWT is still greatly underused. Its share in total transport in the PRC, measured in ton-\nkilometers, was only 4% in 2008. \n10.  Most of the PRC\u2019s navigable waterway network is located within the courses of the \nHeilongjiang, Huaihe, Yangtze, and Zhujiang rivers. The Yangtze River and its tributaries alone \naccount for one-half the national total, or 58,000 km. The Yangtze runs through Anhui, and \nprovides a high-class deep river channel for IWT. Its network of small associated river and \ntributary channels also offer potential for IWT, but past underinvestment in navigation has left \nmany of them navigable only by small vessels during the wet season. Investments to upgrade \nthe river channels to enable year-round IWT by larger vessels at lower unit operating costs can \nplay an important role in achieving the WDZ\u2019s aim of attracting industries from coastal and \nneighboring provinces to cities along the Yangtze in Anhui. \n \n                                                \n4  The development of Xuancheng industrial park is supported by a World Bank loan. World Bank. 2013. China\u2013 \nAnhui Xuancheng Infrastructure for Industry Relocation Project. Washington, DC. \n ", "3 \n11.  The 44 km Shuiyang River channel connects the Xuancheng industrial park within the \nWDZ to the Wushen Canal,5 which in turn connects to Shanghai. This would offer potential \ninvestors in the industrial park the effective transport route they want and need, except that the \nShuiyang\u2019s current shallow depth, sharp bends, and flooding during the wet season prevent it \nfrom accommodating vessels above a very low capacity of 300 deadweight ton (dwt). This not \nonly discourages more extensive use of the waterway, but also increases unit transport costs for \nshippers that have no better option. Rehabilitation of the Shuiyang River channel under the \nproject will allow passage for vessels of up to 1,000 dwt, and provide a much shorter route for \ntransporting goods from Anhui to the Yangtze River Delta.6 The river port to be built by the \nproject will facilitate a shift from road to inland waterway transport for cargo moving to and from \nthe Xuancheng industrial park. \n12.  By supporting IWT, the project will also help the PRC develop the low-carbon transport \nmodes needed to stem the rapid growth in the country\u2019s emissions that contribute to global \nclimate change. The PRC is now the world\u2019s largest producer of greenhouse gases. These \nemissions, including those related to  constantly expanding use of motorized  transport, will \ncontinue to increase for the foreseeable future. Given the priority accorded to the challenge of \nclimate change internationally, providing assistance to the country for developing low-carbon \ntransport is a matter of urgency. The project\u2019s planned flood control measures, including flood \nwalls  and  river  bank  protection,  integrate  protection  and  resilience  into  the  design  and \nconstruction of vulnerable infrastructure investments. This will meet the need to adapt to effects \nof climate change such as changing precipitation patterns, more frequent and intense storms, \nand flash floods. \n13.  The scope of the project\u2019s inland waterway component and the need for it to include an \nintermodal  port  at  Xuancheng  to  serve  the  industrial  park  emerged  from  policy  dialogue \nbetween ADB and the government during project preparation. The project preparation also \nincluded a study on climate change resilience, which helped in identifying the need for project \nflood protection works and developing preliminary designs of embankments on the Shuiyang \nRiver. Assessments of the project roads led to recognition of the road safety issues that are to \nbe addressed through the project\u2019s design features, which will include segregated lanes for \npedestrians and cyclists. \n14.  This will be the second ADB project to support IWT in the PRC, and follows approval in \n2012 of the Hunan Xiangjiang Inland Waterway Transport Project, now in the early stages of \nimplementation.7 The project design incorporates lessons from recent road projects in the PRC, \none  of  which  was  the  need  to  include  capacity  building  support  for  implementation  units, \nparticularly in procurement and safeguards.8 During project preparation, ADB provided guidance \nto the executing agency and the implementing agencies on ADB\u2019s safeguards and procurement \nprocedures. Further capacity building on resettlement is planned for the project implementing \nagencies. \n15.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC for 2011\u2013\n2015.9 The emphasis on traffic safety issues and the development of IWT are in line with ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n5  The Wushen Canal is an ancient waterway that branches off from the Yangtze River and provides a connection \nbetween the city of Wuhu in Anhui Province and Shanghai. \n6  The Yangtze River Delta comprises Shanghai, southern Jiangsu Province, and northern Zhejiang Province. \n7  ADB. 2012.

Impact and Outcome \n16.  The  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  the  establishment  of  an  environmentally  sustainable \nmultimodal transport system in Anhui Province. The outcome will be the development of a more \nefficient, safe, and affordable multimodal transport system in the WDZ. \nC.  Outputs \n17.  The proposed project will include five outputs for ADB financing: (i) road network and \nsafety improvement; (ii) public transport improvement of highways; (iii) inland waterway network \nupgrade; (iv) intermodal port; and (v) institutional strengthening and capacity building. \n18.  Output  1:  Road  network  and  safety  improvement.  The  project  will  (i)  upgrade \napproximately 31 km of the S319 road (Erba\u2013Wuwei section) from class II to class I and add a \nnew 5.77 km road section, (ii) upgrade approximately 47 km of the S367 Ma\u2019anshan North \nPassage Road from class IV to class II, and (iii) improve the safety of these roads by introducing \nsuch measures as central dividers, pedestrian bridges, road markings, signage, and a speed-\ncontrolled junction design. \n19.  Output 2: Highways and public transport improvement. The project will (i) construct \napproximately 16 km of a new class I highway section (G206) between Dongliu and Yaodu, and \n(ii) upgrade approximately 22 km of G318 and the S320 Yimu Highway from class II to class I. \nThe improvements on these highways will include provisions for public transport and NMT, such \nas priority bus lanes and bus stops, and segregated and dedicated lanes for pedestrians and \ncyclists. \n20.  Output 3: Inland waterway network improvement. The project will (i) widen, dredge, \nand provide bend realignment and slope protection for approximately 44 km Shuiyang River \nchannel; (ii) build and install two low-water rubber dams;11 (iii) construct one ship lock;12 and (iv) \nbuild a new road bridge over the channel at Xiaohekou. \n21.  Output 4: Intermodal port. The project will build (i) a new intermodal port northeast of \nXuancheng industrial park, and (ii) four 1,000 dwt berths. This Shuiyang River inland port will \ncater to the future traffic demand from the Xuancheng industrial park, and facilitate a shift from \nthe transport of cargo by road to use of the inland waterway network. \n22.  Output 5: Institutional strengthening and capacity building. The project will provide \n(i) consulting  services  and  equipment  for  intelligent  shipping,  (ii)  road  safety  audits,  and \n(iii) domestic  and  overseas  training.

The  designs  for  project  roads  and  highways  will  be  based  on  the  PRC\u2019s  highway \nstandards, with some adjustments, particularly for safety features. Road safety audits will be \nconducted on the detailed designs and during and after construction to ensure compliance with \nrequired road safety standards. Based on performance on past projects, the technical capacity \nof the executing and implementing agencies is considered adequate to implement the project\u2019s \ntechnical aspects. The design of the project\u2019s IWT output was also found to be appropriate and \ntechnically sound. The PRC has considerable experience and proven performance in the design \nand installation of similar facilities. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n30.  Economic evaluation. The project is economically viable, with an estimated economic \ninternal rate of return of 16.7% and a net present value of $194.7 million at a 12.0% discount \nrate. The estimate was based on the four transport-related outputs for which economic benefits \ncould be quantified. The estimated costs include investment in civil works and equipment, land \nacquisition and resettlement, and operation and maintenance. The estimated benefits include \n ", "8 \n \nsavings in the costs of operating vehicles, travel time, traffic accidents, and the carbon dioxide \nemissions to be avoided when freight shifts from road transport to IWT as a result of the project. \nSensitivity analysis employing scenarios of cost overruns and benefit reductions demonstrated \nthat the project\u2019s economic viability is robust. \n31.  Financial  evaluation.  The  project  has  both  revenue-generating  and  nonrevenue \ncomponents. The nonrevenue components include the road network upgrades. The government \nhas confirmed that none of the project roads will be subject to tolls. The financial analysis \nassessed the financial sustainability of the road components and found that the executing \nagency  will  have  sufficient  revenues  to  repay  the  loan  and  finance  the  operation  and \nmaintenance of the project roads. The inland waterway and port components will generate \nrevenue. The financial internal rate of return after tax was estimated to be 2.49%. As the \nfinancial internal rate of return is higher than the 1.89% weighted average cost of capital, the \ninland waterway and port components are considered financially viable. \nC.  Governance \n32.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement \ndocuments and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  the  executing  agency,  and  the  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \nAn assessment of financial management capacity indicates that the executing and implementing \nagencies  carefully  follow  PRC  policies  and  procedures  for  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement. The executing agency has strong accounting and financial management capacity, \nas well as experience in managing multiple large construction projects. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n33.  A social and poverty analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines. Per \ncapita GDP in Anhui province was only 69% of the national average in 2010. One of the 19 \nstate-level poor counties in the province\u2014Wuwei County\u2014lies within the project area. Poverty \nincidence in the project area is 13.29%, based on the current national rural poverty line of \nCNY2,300.15 Inadequate road infrastructure is a major obstacle to economic development and \npoverty reduction in Anhui. The project will result in better road connectivity, reduce several \ntransport-related costs, cut travel times, and improve access to economic and employment \nopportunities and social services. The project design addresses the needs of all social and \nincome groups through specific features to improve public transport and NMT. Its measures to \nimprove  road  safety  further  strengthen  the  design\u2019s  social  inclusiveness.  The  project  will \nstimulate  investment  in  the  project  area,  promote  industrial  growth,  and  open  up  new \nopportunities for nonfarm employment.  Local people will directly benefit through access to \nskilled and unskilled employment created during project construction. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n34.  Environment.  The  project  is  category  A for  environment.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) and an environmental management plan (EMP) have been prepared for the \nproject  roads  and  the  waterway.  These  documents  comply  with  the  PRC\u2019s  regulatory \n                                                \n15 Rural poverty line was raised to CNY 2,300 per capita in year 2011. \n \n ", "9 \nrequirements and ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and were disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite on 31 July 2013. Public consultation was carried out to inform the design and EIA \nprocesses, and will continue throughout project implementation. The EIA showed that only \nmodest environmental impacts and risks can be expected, and that they can be limited to an \nacceptable level through the implementation of the EMP and compliance with loan covenants. \nThe  EMP  addresses  potential  impacts  of  the  project  outputs  and  sets  out  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  measures,  institutional  arrangements,  training  requirements,  and  a  budget  for \nimplementing  the  EMP  that  represents  1.95%  of  the  overall  project  budget.  Capacity \ndevelopment  and  institutional  strengthening  are  planned  to  minimize  environmental  risks. \nEnvironmental complaints will be handled through a grievance redress mechanism established \nfor the project. Key environmental impacts, risks, and the associated mitigation measures are \npresented in the EIA.16 \n \n35.  Resettlement. The project is category A for involuntary resettlement. It will result in \nacquisition of 285.1 hectares of land, including 251.7 hectares of collective land and 33.5 \nhectares  of  state-owned  land.  Land  acquisition  and  house  demolition  will  affect  4,408 \nhouseholds and 17,342 people overall. Of this total, 877 households and 3,605 people will be \naffected by house demolition. The project will also result in relocation of 33 enterprises, affecting \n111  persons.  A  total  of  2,496  households  with  9,584  people  will  be  affected  by  physical \ndisplacement or loss of more than 10% of their land and other productive assets. \n \n36.  The executing agency will oversee resettlement implementation. It has considerable \nexperience in ADB safeguards procedures, is executing an ongoing ADB-financed transport \nproject, and has previously implemented three World Bank projects. The implementing agencies \nwill assist with day-to-day resettlement implementation.  Five resettlement plans have been \nprepared that adequately address the potential impacts of land acquisition and resettlement and \nset out mitigation measures, including livelihood restoration. The resettlement plans have been \nprepared in consultation with the affected people. Public consultations were undertaken during \nproject preparation and will continue throughout the project cycle, as per the public consultation \nschedule under the resettlement plans. A grievance redress mechanism will be established to \naddress the concerns of affected peoples. The resettlement plans have been endorsed by the \nexecuting and implementing agencies, disclosed to the affected peoples, and posted on the \nADB website. Resettlement implementation will also be monitored through independent external \nmonitors. \n \n37.  The executing agency has assured ADB that adequate counterpart funding will be made \navailable for land acquisition and resettlement, in line with the annual funding requirements \nstipulated in the resettlement plans. \n38.  Indigenous people. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. Han \nChinese, the PRC\u2019s majority ethnic group, make up 99% of Anhui Province\u2019s population. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 \n                                                \n16 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProcurement could be delayed.

ASSURANCES  \n40.  The government and the APDOT have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n41.  The government and the APDOT have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Anhui Intermodal Sustainable Transport \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 23 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n \n 31 January 2014\n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nAn environmentally  By 2020  Anhui Provincial  Traffic law enforcement is \nsustainable  The total traffic carried by the  Department of Transport  effective.  \nmultimodal  inland waterway system in Anhui  statistics   \ntransport system is  Province measured in tons and    The WDZ develops as \nestablished in  ton-km increases by 20% from    planned by the national \nAnhui Province  levels in 2012.    government. \n     \nThe traffic accident rate,  Anhui Provincial   \nmeasured by road crash fatalities  Department of Public \nper 10,000 vehicles in Anhui, is  Security \nreduced from 2.61 in 2012 to   \n1.50. \nOutcome      Assumption \nAn efficient, safe,  By 2018  Data from Anhui Provincial  Work to improve sections \nand affordable  Vessel handling capacity on  Port and Shipping  of the Wushen Canal is \nmultimodal  Shuiyang River increased from  Construction Investment  completed. \ntransport system  300 dwt in 2012 to 1,000 dwt   Group Co.
