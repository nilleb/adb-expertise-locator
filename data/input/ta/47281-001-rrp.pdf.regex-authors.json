THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  National  Highway  Network  Development  in \nBalochistan Project.1 \n2.  The proposed project will rehabilitate (i) the two-lane National Highway No. 50 (N-50) \nfrom Zhob to Mughal Kot (81 kilometers [km]); and (ii) the two-lane National Highway No. 70 \n(N-70) from Qila Saifullah to Waghum Rud (120 km) in Balochistan. Local community facilitation \ncenters will also be developed along the project roads to enable local communities to take \nadvantage of the improved mobility through rehabilitated project roads. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Pakistan\u2019s transport sector contributes 10% to its gross domestic product, consumes \n35% of the total energy annually, and is the recipient of 20%\u201325% of the annual federal public \nsector  development  program.  It  generates  a  large  number  of  employment  opportunities, \nestimated at 2.3 million jobs (5.9% of the employed labor force). The total road network is about \n260,000  km  and  consists  of  national  highways  (about  11,400  km),  provincial  highways \n(92,500 km), and district and urban roads (156,100 km). The national highway network, which is \n4% of the total road network, caters to 80% of the commercial traffic. Road transport is a \ndominant transport mode in Pakistan\u2014accounting for 91% of passenger traffic and 96% of \nfreight traffic. Despite the high reliance on road transport, the quality of the road infrastructure \ncauses severe capacity constraints. Although the quality of the national highways has improved \nconsiderably over the past decades through continuous investments and better road asset \nmanagement, the overall road condition needs further improvement. \n4.  Pakistan is strategically located to act as a hub for subregional transport and to take \nadvantage of the subregion\u2019s rapidly improving environment for the development of transit and \ncross-border trade and commerce. Pakistan\u2019s road corridors offer the shortest route to the sea \nfor landlocked Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Xinjiang province of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. However, physical, institutional, and other constraints prevent Pakistan from taking full \nadvantage of its location. The potential for increased trade through improved trade facilitation, \nrehabilitated transport links, efficient cross-border movements, and increased efficiency at ports \nhas not fully materialized. \n5.  Before 1995, Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to Pakistan had focused on \nimprovement of rural access roads to ensure all-weather access to villages\u2014to complement \nADB\u2019s then focus on agriculture sector development. From 1995, the perspective was expanded \nto national connectivity for economic growth in general, and the assistance started to cover \nprovincial and national highways. Since 2005, ADB assistance has focused on the trade corridor \nand regional connectivity to help government take advantage of its strategic location and act as \na hub for subregional transport. Two multitranche financing facilities provided in 2005 and 2007 \nwere designed to construct and/or improve key trade corridors connecting sea ports, industrial \ncenters, and border crossing points.2 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program. Manila; and ADB. 2005. \n ", "2 \n6.  In parallel with assistance for road infrastructure improvement, ADB has supported the \ngovernment to address institutional constraints. ADB\u2019s program loan provided in 2001 for the \nnational  sector  policy  reform  program  assisted  the  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  in \nimplementing comprehensive reform programs covering (i) transport policy, (ii) road sector \nresource management, (iii) road sector preservation, (iv) institutional efficiency improvement, \nand (v) road safety.3 Through institutional capacity development and institutional reforms, the \nNHA  has  become  a  capable  road  agency  despite  structural  constraints.  It  managed  to \n(i) establish  the  road  maintenance  fund  and  secure  a  stable  source  of  road  maintenance \nexpenditure; (ii) establish the road asset management system, which allows more efficient use \nof scarce resources; (iii) establish the National Highway and Motorway Police, which contributes \nto  controlling  overloading  and  reducing  traffic  violations  and  accidents  on  motorways  and \nnational highways; (iv) promote awareness of policy makers and regulators on road safety; and \n(v) change the mindset of policy makers and NHA officials toward public\u2013private partnerships. \n7.  Despite  these  achievements,  sector  reforms  should  continue,  particularly  for  (i)  the \nchronic shortfall of road maintenance resources generated through the road maintenance fund \n(the toll base should be expanded and the toll rate should be rationalized); (ii) overloading (the \ntrucking industry should be restructured\u2014this is dominated by a small fleet of owners and by \nlocal manufacturers producing low-capacity, low-powered trucks protected by high import tariffs \non high-capacity, multi-axle trucks); (iii) road safety (national and provincial efforts should be \nconcerted, with responsibilities and accountability clearly demarcated among the institutions and \nprovincial departments); and (iv) public\u2013private partnership (the country risk should be reduced \nto a tolerable level for private investors to price it properly). \n8.  Balochistan  is  situated  in  southwest  Pakistan  and  is  the  largest  province  by  area, \nconstituting  44%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  total  land  mass.  It  is  bordered  by  Afghanistan  north  and \nnorthwest, by Iran southwest, and by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered \nTribal Areas northeast. To the south lies the Arabian Sea. Balochistan links the geopolitical \nregions of the Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asia; and provides the shortest route to \nseaports from Central Asia and Xinjiang province, the People\u2019s Republic of China. Despite this \nlarge potential as a transport hub, its economic development has been stagnant because of \npoor security and political instability, and its transport infrastructure is dire\u2014hardly serviceable \nfor regional transit traffic. The road network and connectivity is the poorest in the country. \nBalochistan has the lowest density of roads among the four provinces. \n9.  Balochistan is connected to the country\u2019s political and industrial centers by the N-50 \n(from Quetta to Qila Saifullah, Zhob, Mughal Kot, DI Khan, Kohat, and ultimately to Peshawar \nand Islamabad) and the N-70 (from Quetta to Qila Saifullah, Loralai, Waghum Rud, DG Khan, \nand ultimately to Multan). Despite the government\u2019s effort to improve mobility along these \ncorridors,  the  Zhob\u2013Mughal  Kot  section  of  the  N-50  and  the  Qila  Saifullah\u2013Waghum  Rud \nsection of the N-70 remain missing links and seriously hamper the seamless flow of traffic. \nConsequently, traffic originating in Quetta bound for northern and western Punjab, the political \nand industrial centers in the country, takes a longer route through the N-65 (from Quetta to \nJacobabad and Sukkur in Sindh province) and then the N-5 (northward to Multan and farther to \nLahore and Islamabad). Rehabilitating the two missing links and completing the network of the \nN-50 and the N-70 will redirect traffic to a shorter and less costly route, and help integrate cities \nand towns along the N-50 and the N-70 into Balochistan\u2019s development initiative. \n                                                                                                                                                       \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for the National Highway Development Sector Investment Program. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Road Sector Development Program. Manila. \n ", "3 \n10.  Improvement of the national highway network in Balochistan  is expected to enable \nsocioeconomic development of the province by shortening distances across the province with \nimproved  interprovincial  links.  However,  trickling  down  of  these  benefits  to  local  rural \ncommunities in extreme impoverishment requires a transport link to enable local communities to \naccess consumers. Such a link is hampered by (i) unavailable or limited access to transport \n(goods and freight transport) to carry the harvest of small farmers to nearby urban centers, \n(ii) nonexistent local markets or thin markets in nearby rural centers for agricultural products, \n(iii) limited information and resources to access competitive markets in faraway areas, and \n(iv) limited resources and opportunities for engaging in alternate livelihoods such as small-scale \nbusiness or trade at the roadside. As a link between project roads and the local population, \ncommunity  facilitation  centers  in  nearby  rural  settlements  along  the  project  roads  will  be \ninstrumental in distributing the benefits of the improved highway network to rural communities \n(see para. 15). \n11.  Since early 2000s, Balochistan has been neglected from Pakistan\u2019s main development \nthrust,  mainly  because  of  poor  security  and  political  instability.  Balochistan\u2019s  lack  of \ndevelopment allows insurgents to gain ground and a vicious circle follows. The government \ndefines its top development agenda as equitable provincial development, and tries to help \nlagging  provinces  like  Balochistan  to  catch  up  and  integrate  with  the  rest  of  the  country. \nADB support for Balochistan\u2019s road network improvement will encourage the government to \npursue its priority agenda and be prepared for the future when Balochistan will play a key role in \neconomic growth and regional cooperation and integration. \n12.  ADB has coordinated closely with other development partners, including the World Bank \nand Japan International Cooperation Agency, for road sector development in Pakistan; and has \nplayed  a  lead  role  in  upgrading  road  infrastructure  and  sector management.  Collaboration \nbetween development partners for sector reforms was instrumental to transforming the NHA into \na service-oriented road asset manager with a sophisticated road asset management system. \nThrough involvement in road sector development, ADB has gained valuable lessons such as \ndesigning projects with a manageable number of components and implementing agencies, \ncarefully assessing the capacity of counterpart funding, estimating project costs conservatively \nand avoiding cost overrun, and properly  assessing the time frame of land acquisition and \nresettlement of affected people. These lessons are adequately incorporated in the design of the \nproject. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The expected impact of the project will be an accessible, affordable, and safe national \nhighway network in Balochistan. The expected outcome will be reduced transport cost from \nBalochistan to the political and industrial centers of the country. \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The first output will be the rehabilitated two-lane Zhob\u2013Mughal Kot section of the N-50 \n(81 km) and the Qila Saifullah\u2013Waghum Rud section of the N-70 (120 km). \n15.  The project will develop community facilitation centers along the project roads, focusing \non (i) creating opportunities for the local population to exploit the benefits offered by improved \nmobility; (ii) improving local market hubs in rural centers along the project road, with community \ninvolvement; (iii) improving rural market hubs\u2019 access to, and linkage with, national markets \nthrough project roads; and (iv) helping socioeconomic uplift of local communities by organizing \n ", "4 \nand promoting local products and alternate means of livelihood. The second output will be five \nlocal community facilitation centers along the project roads, better integrated into the improved \nmobility through rehabilitated project roads. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $235 million (Table 1). \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItems  Amounta \nA.  Base Costb    \n  1.

Interest during construction for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nloan  has  been  computed  at  the  3-year  forward  London  interbank  offered  rate  plus  a  spread  of  0.5%. \nCommitment charges for an ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \nSources: National Highway Authority and ADB estimates. \n17.  The government  has requested  a  loan  of $195  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,4 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. ADB will finance resettlement cost to \nexpedite payment of resettlement compensation and avoid project implementation delay. \n18.  The financing plan is in Table 2.5 The government portion will finance taxes and duties \nand contingencies. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \n  Ordinary capital resources (loan)  195.0  83.0 \nGovernment  40.0  17.0 \n      Total  235.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                \n4  The interest includes a maturity premium of 10 basis points. This is based on the above loan terms and the \ngovernment\u2019s choice of repayment option and dates. \n5  The Department for International Development of the United Kingdom has indicated its interest to contribute about \n$65 million equivalent of grant cofinancing to the project. If such cofinancing becomes available, it will be on a joint \nbasis with full administration by ADB. \n ", "5 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The executing agency will be the NHA. A project implementation unit (PIU) will be \nestablished under the NHA for overall implementation of construction, including supervision of \ncontractors and supervision consultants. A general manager will head the PIU, which will have \nsuitably qualified staff including project directors and safeguard specialists. \n20.  Procurement of goods, civil works, and related services financed from the ADB loan will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  To  ensure  competition,  international  competitive  bidding  contracts  will  be  adopted. \nThe project will require consulting services for design review and construction supervision. \nConsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Advance contracting and retroactive financing will be \nsought  to  ensure  timely  implementation  of  the  project  (Table  3).  Retroactive  financing  for \nresettlement cost will be executed through reimbursement arrangements under ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time). The government has been \nadvised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance the project. \n21.  For the development of community facilitation centers, a social development specialist \nwith adequate knowledge of the socioeconomic fabric of the area and local needs will be hired \nas part of supervision consultants. The social community development specialist will carry out \npublic  consultations  with  all  stakeholders  (including  the  local  administration,  civil  society \norganizations working in the field, and the local community) to assess their needs; and engage \nwith relevant local government departments and community support organizations to provide \nand manage the required facilities. Based on consultation, the PIU will design and implement \nthe  facilitation  centers  under  the  supervision  of  the  construction  supervision  consultants. \nThe civil works contractor will carry out any construction work. \n22.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.6 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2015\u2013June 2018 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2018 \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body  Steering committee, NHA \nChairman, NHA (chair) \nSenior members, NHA (members) \n(ii) Executing agency  NHA \n(iii) Implementation unit  PIU in Qila Saifullah, headed by general manager with 2 project directors and 7 staff \nmembers assigned \nProcurement  International competitive  4 contracts  $188.2 million \nbidding \nConsulting services  QCBS  International: 78 person-months  $9.0 million \nNational: 2,309 person-months \nRetroactive financing  Advance contracting for civil works and supervision consultant. \nand/or advance contracting  Retroactive financing for resettlement cost for up to $1.0 million of the loan amount, \nprovided that expenditures are incurred during the 12 months before the signing of the \nloan agreement. \n                                                \n6  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nAspects  Arrangements \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  NHA  =  National  Highway  Authority,  PIU  =  project  implementation  unit, \nQCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: ADB estimates. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  The  existing  project  roads  will  be  rehabilitated  to  NHA  specifications  for  national \nhighways\u2014carriageway width of 7.3 meters, with two lanes constructed of aggregate base \ncourses and asphaltic layers and 2.5 meter-wide surface treated shoulders. Drainage will be \nimproved through the construction of reinforced cement concrete box culverts as well as the \nconstruction of new bridge structures as required.7 Road safety works (including signage, lane \nmarking, and road furniture) will be carried out in accordance with NHA standards for national \nhighways. The proposed rehabilitation work is technically feasible, with manageable social and \nenvironmental impacts. \n24.  For both road sections, the detailed design of the road pavement, road geometrics, and \nbridge structures has been conducted in accordance with acceptable international practices. \nThe pavement design of both roads sections is based on Road Note 31 (Transport Research \nLaboratory, United Kingdom).8 Geometric design is based on the American Association of State \nHighway and Transportation Officials policy on geometric design of highways and streets.9 \nBridges are designed in accordance with the West Pakistan Code of Practice for highway \nbridges  1967,10 and  conform  to  the  American  Concrete  Institute  Code  of  Practice11 and \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Bridge Design Codes.12 \n25.  The bid documents for procurement of civil  works packages contain these detailed \ndesign  drawings.  Under  the  loan,  the  consultant  firms  recruited  for  design  review  and \nconstruction supervision will carry out a review of the detailed design, and incorporate any \nchanges needed during implementation. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  The economic analysis evaluates the economic viability of the N-50 Zhob\u2013Mughal Kot \nand the N-70 Qila Saifullah to Waghum Rud sections. The analyses compare the benefits \narising from the project\u2014time savings and a reduction in vehicle operating costs\u2014against the \nup-front investment cost and incremental changes to operation and maintenance costs over the \n20-year appraisal period. \n                                                \n7  As the country experienced heavy floods in 2009\u20132011, the NHA strengthened its design standards by raising the \nroad profile in the project area to make its road assets more resilient to climate change. \n8  Transport Research Laboratory. 1993.

The economic analysis shows that the project is viable, yielding an overall economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of 19.7%. The N-50 Zhob\u2013Mughal Kot section has an EIRR of \n23.8%, while the N-70 Qila Saifullah\u2013Waghum Rud section has an EIRR of 15.1%. As both \nsections have EIRRs in excess of the ADB threshold, the project is considered economically \nviable. \n28.  There are no plans to toll either the N-50 Zhob\u2013Mughal Kot or the N-70 Qila Saifullah\u2013\nWaghum  Rud  sections,  so  the  project  will  not  be  revenue-generating.  The  government \nestablished a road maintenance fund in 2003 that is financed by toll revenue from motorways \nand national highways, federal grants, and other road revenues. The fund provides a stable \nsource for road maintenance expenditure\u2014free from federal fiscal budget allocation, which is \nopen to political influence. The fund has enabled the NHA to plan and use scarce resources \neffectively, setting priorities according to the economic rate of return calculated by the road \nasset management system. Resources generated by the road maintenance fund are 30%\u201340% \nshort  of  the  unconstrained  requirement  to  maintain  roads  at  the  level  of  new  pavement. \nConstrained by scarce resources, the NHA aims to maintain the roads in such a way that the \nvehicle operating cost is kept 30%\u201340% higher than that of newly paved roads. The project \nroads will be maintained in line with this strategy. However, in the long term, the standard of \nroad maintenance will be raised to the level of new pavement. To overcome this shortage of \nfunds, the NHA is trying to rationalize the toll level, one of the lowest in the world, and expand \nthe base of toll collection by building more toll-based motorways and transforming existing \nnational highways into toll-based. \nC.  Governance \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NHA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n30.  A financial management assessment of NHA or the implementation of the project was \ncarried  out.  The  purpose  of  the  assessment  was  to  determine  the  financial  management \ncapacity  of  the  NHA  in  maintaining  the  accounting  systems,  financial  controls,  and  audit \narrangements.  NHA  financial  accounting,  internal  and  external  auditing  rules,  and  internal \ncontrol  systems  follow  generally  accepted  international  accounting  and  auditing  practices. \nThe NHA maintains separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred \nfor  the  project,  and  use  of  local  funds,  including  adequate  internal  controls  and  financial \nreporting arrangements. The project accounts and related financial statements will be audited \nannually in accordance with national and international auditing standards by the Auditor General \nof Pakistan and by a chartered accountant. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n31.  The country\u2019s national poverty rate is 33%, while the population below the extreme \npoverty line is 21% (2012).13 Balochistan is one of the poorest provinces in Pakistan. In addition \nto long-standing political instability, the poor condition of infrastructure inhibits economic activity \nof people both within and outside the province. In Balochistan, the poverty rate in 2012 was \nestimated at 52%, and poverty incidence is higher in rural areas (72%) than in urban areas \n                                                \n13 Sustainable Policy Development Institute. 2012. Clustered Deprivation: District Profile of Poverty in Pakistan. \nIslamabad. \n ", "8 \n(29%). The project aims to increase economic growth through the enhancement of trade and \ntraffic along the project roads. The project will benefit both local communities (through improved \naccess to  markets  and  social  service facilities,  and  enhanced  opportunities for  community \nnetworking) and the population of the wider region through transportation of goods. During the \nsocioeconomic survey, about 200 households and men and women from settlements along the \nproject road participated in consultations and focus group discussions. The majority stated that \nthe project would increase economic and employment opportunities by improving linkages to \nmarkets, production centers, and public and social service facilities. \n32.  Gender.  Established  sociocultural  practices  in  the  project  area  mean  that  women \nresiding along the project roads are unlikely to participate in civil works or roadside business \nwith construction workers or drivers. Focus group discussions were undertaken with women in \nthe  project  influence  area,  and  detailed  gender  analysis  will  be  conducted  by  a  national \nspecialist early during implementation to identify priority concerns of local women. These will be \ntaken into account in designing the function and activities of the proposed community facilitation \ncenters.  In  preliminary  consultations,  women  identified  project  benefits  for  them  as  better \ntransport  services  and  improved  access  to  social  services,  markets,  education  and  health \nfacilities, and employment opportunities. The bidding documents provide clauses designed to \nensure that all civil works contractors comply with applicable labor laws; do not employ child \nlabor or forced labor; encourage the employment of the poor, particularly women; and do not \noffer different wages to men and women for work of equal value. \n33.  HIV/AIDS, other communicable diseases, and human trafficking. The prevalence \nrate of HIV/AIDS in the country is 0.10% (2011). Surveillance data for Balochistan in 2011 found \nHIV infection among 7% of injecting drug users in Quetta. 14 However, the potential risks of \nHIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections and/or communicable diseases are always a \nconcern because the main reasons for prevalence are sexual transmissions and abuse of \ninjections, which are not publicly well campaigned and not well regulated, particularly in rural \nareas. There is no evidence that the project will increase HIV/AIDS incidence, during or after \nimplementation. However, any associated risks will be minimized by conducting awareness \ncampaigns  targeting  construction  workers  and  local  populations  during  implementation. \nThe  contractor  will  be  required  to  conduct  these  campaigns,  under  the  oversight  of  the \nconstruction supervision consultant and the NHA, and such requirement will be included in the \ncivil works bid documents and contract. \nE.  Safeguards  \n34.  Environment.  The project has been categorized environment category B. The civil \nworks associated with the two road rehabilitation subprojects are limited to resurfacing and \nsome widening. This will involve minimum civil works, and the entire operation will remain within \nthe existing right-of-way (ROW) of both highways. The environmental impacts that will result \nfrom  this  are  limited to  the construction  phase  of the  two  subprojects;  all  impacts  will  be \ntemporary  in  nature,  with  no  residual  long-term  impacts.  Initial  environmental  examination \nreports for the two project roads were prepared and uploaded on the ADB website on 8 and \n9 January 2014. The environment, afforestation, land, and social wing of the NHA will be \nresponsible for implementation of the  environmental management plan. This NHA unit will \nsubmit to ADB semiannual environmental monitoring reports, which will be disclosed on the \nADB website. \n                                                \n14 National AIDS Control Program Pakistan. 2011.

The  project  is  classified  category  B  for \nresettlement impacts. The project was designed to avoid land acquisition and minimize the \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts by adopting existing alignment of the project roads and using \nthe most feasible technical design. According to the detailed design, the proposed rehabilitation \nand improvement works will be confined to 15\u201321 meter width while the ROW of 33 meter in \nurban  areas  and  66  meter  in  rural  areas  is  secured.  However,  in  some  sections  near \nsettlements and along agricultural lands, the ROW is encroached by adjoining landowners. \nAn impact assessment and full census was conducted, based on the detailed designs (updated \nin 2013) for both project roads, and resettlement plans were prepared in accordance with \nnational legal requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). According to the \ncensus survey, no affected household will be physically or economically displaced. \n36.  According to resettlement plans, there will be no land acquisition, and key resettlement \nimpacts  include  partially  affected  structures  (permanent  structures  and  temporary  thatched \nsheds or kiosks) and trees encroached onto the ROW. All affected households will restore or \nrehabilitate their structures at the same place outside of the ROW and will not be displaced \nphysically or economically. The project impacts will be temporary and insignificant in nature; \naffected households will be compensated for all their lost assets on a replacement cost basis, \nand income restoration support will be provided for business and livelihood losses. The total \nresettlement budget is estimated as PRs98.3 million. \n37.  Public consultation and information disclosure were undertaken during the preparation of \nresettlement  plans,  including  affected  persons  and  the  public  along  the  project  roads. \nThe  consultation  and  information-sharing  process  will  be  continued  throughout  project \nimplementation. The main features of the resettlement plan\u2014project impacts, asset valuation, \nentitlements, and compensation provisions\u2014were disclosed to project-affected people during \nconsultative  meetings.  An  information  booklet  was  prepared  in  the  local  language  and \ndistributed to project-affected people. The resettlement plan has been disclosed to the public via \nthe NHA and ADB websites. The NHA will regularly monitor implementation of the resettlement \nplans; and the result, including social monitoring, will be shared with ADB quarterly during the \nimplementation  phase  of  resettlement  plans  and  semiannually  throughout  project \nimplementation after the resettlement plan has been implemented. \n38.  Indigenous peoples. The project roads are located in the settled areas of Balochistan \nProvince, with no indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).  Therefore,  no  indigenous  peoples  communities  will  be  affected  by  the  project. \nAccordingly, the project is classified category C under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, with \nno indigenous peoples planning documents required. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 The risks are assessed manageable by \nadopting  mitigating  measures,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs of mitigation. \n \n                                                \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nGovernment\u2019s development agenda for  The new government has reiterated its commitment to ensuring balanced \nbalanced provincial development  provincial development, focusing on underdeveloped provinces like \ncompromised, and inadequate  Balochistan.
