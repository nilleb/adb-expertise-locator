Weak\ngovernance has resulted in inefficient utility operations, power\ntheft, illegal power supply, reduced billing and collection, and\nnonpayment of arrears. These problems have had an adverse\nimpact on the financial performance of the utilities and have\nhindered  the  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  the  power\nsector.  This situation has affected the poor segment of the\npopulation more than the affluent and contributed to the build\nup of the financial crisis in the sector, which has negatively\naffected  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic  framework.\nAppropriate  reforms  and  necessary  adjustment  measures,\nincluding introduction of a market-driven system, are needed to\nrestore financial and operational viability in the sector and to\nmake  it  self-sustaining.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nsupport of the Government\u2019s initiatives for structural reforms in\nthe energy sector is considered essential given the urgent need\nto introduce competition as the driving force for improvements\nand  private  sector  participation  as  a  vehicle  for  creating  a\ncompetitive environment. Ensuring a stable supply of electricity\nis  essential  for  Pakistan\u2019s  economic  recovery  and  thus  job\ncreation for the poor. The Program provides a sound basis for\nthe Government to reform and restructure the energy sector.\nThe development of a competitive energy market under the\nreform Program will result in efficiency gains that will have a\npositive impact on poverty reduction. The ESRP is an integral\nelement  of  the  structural  adjustment  program  of  the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) in Pakistan.\nObjective and Scope The long-term goal of ADB\u2019s intervention is to ensure a self-\nsustaining,  efficient,  and  competitive  energy  sector  that  can\nprovide the required quantity and quality of energy supply at the\nleast  cost  to  consumers.  The  competitive  industry  structure\nmust  be  enhanced  and  market  regulation  strengthened  to\nensure  investor  confidence  and  consumer  protection.  The", "iii\nProgram identifies the following areas of reforms necessary to\nachieve its objectives: (i) enhancement of governance in the\nsector, (ii) enhancement of the legal and regulatory  framework\nand strengthening of the capacity of the sector regulator, (iii)\nfinancial  restructuring  and  privatization  of  Karachi  Electric\nSupply  Corporation  (KESC),  (iv)  restructuring  of  Water  and\nPower  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  and  privatization  of\ncorporatized entities, (v) creation of an enabling environment\nfor a competitive electricity market, (vi) resolution of the IPP\nissue and finalization of the Hub River Power Plant Company\n(HUBCO) and the Kot Addu Power Plant Company (KAPCO)\ncases, and (vii) enhancement of reform in the natural gas and\npetroleum  subsector.  The  reform  program  will  be  jointly\nsupported by ADB, the World Bank, and IMF, with the World\nBank (WB) providing parallel financing.\nClassification Economic growth\nEnvironment\nAssessment Category C: Environmental implications were reviewed and no\nsignificant adverse impacts were identified.\nThe Loans\nAmounts and Terms (i) A program loan of $300 million will be provided, from ADB\u2019s\nordinary  capital  resources  (OCR),  with  interest  to  be\ndetermined in accordance with the pool-based variable lending\nrate system for US dollar loans and with a term of 15 years,\nincluding a grace period of 3 years, and such other terms and\nconditions as set forth in the draft Loan Agreement.\n(ii)  A  program  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSDR39,083,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, for a\nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with\ninterest of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period, and\n1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n(iii)  A  TA  loan,  in  various  currencies,  equivalent  to\nSDR3,908,000 from the Special Funds resources of the ADB\nfor a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and\nwith an interest rate of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace\nperiod, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nProgram Period\nand Tranching The Program period will be January 2000 to December 2003.\nThe Government will be able to withdraw funds from the loan\naccount up to 31 December 2003 (a period of three years from\nloan  effectiveness).  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  three\ntranches. The first tranche, equivalent to $150 million, will be\nmade available on loan effectiveness, of which, $100 million will", "iv\nbe  from  OCR,  and  SDR39,083,000  from  Special  Funds\nresources. An incentive tranche of $50 million, from OCR, will\nbe made available after three months and upon satisfactory\ncompliance with the stipulated conditions. The second and third\ntranches, each amounting to $75 million, will be released in\nDecember 2001 and December 2002. Specific conditionalities\nare  set  for  the  release  of  the  second  and  third  tranches;\nhowever,  if  all  conditions  for  the  second  tranche  are  met,\nexcept  the  privatization  of  the  two  WAPDA  entities  (one\ndistribution company and one generation company), and if the\nthird tranche condition in respect of the privatization of KESC\nhas  been  met,  then  the  two  privatization  conditions  will  be\ntransposed, and all conditions for the release of the second\ntranche will be considered to be met.\nExecuting Agency\nImplementation\nArrangements The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency.\nMOF  will  coordinate  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  the\nESRP, and administer the utilization of the loan proceeds. MOF\nwill be supported by (i) the Ministry of Water and Power in the\nimplementation of the sector reforms, (ii) the National Electric\nPower Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) to ensure proper sector\nregulation, and (iii) the Privatization Commission to support the\nprivatization of KESC and other corporatized WAPDA entities.\nA federal steering committee and a KESC privatization cell will\nensure the timely implementation of the reform Program.\nProcurement The proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the full\nforeign exchange costs (excluding local taxes and duties) of\ngoods  and  services  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\nmember countries (other than items specified in the prohibited\nlist  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral\nsources).\nCounterpart Funds The counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the\nprogram loan will be used to finance the adjustment costs such\nas  financial  relief  to  the  utilities  and  certain  programs  and\nactivities consistent with the ESRP.\nTA Loan The TA loan for capacity enhancement in the energy sector will\nbe  used  to  undertake  (i)  a  poverty  impact  assessment  to\nmonitor and evaluate impacts on residential and commercial\nconsumers, with special attention to the poorest segment of\nconsumers; and (ii) a labor impact assessment and mitigation\nmeasures  to  reduce  vulnerability  of  redundant  workers.    A\nportion of the TA funds may be used to prepare a plan to\nreduce vulnerability of redundant workers in consultation with\nall stakeholders.", "v\nKESC will be the Executing Agency of the TA loan, and will\nprovide  the  necessary  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  local\ntransportation, and other services to the consultants.\nAll procurement under the TA loan will be in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  The  consultants  will  be\nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to\nthe ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.\nSafeguards and Risks The most important safeguard is that the reform Program is\ncomprehensive and was formulated by the Government. The\nplans  for  its  implementation  have  been  worked  out  by  the\nGovernment  with  due  attention  to  political  realities  and\nimplementation capacity. A second factor is the sequencing of\nactions that are already in place, including the establishment of\nNEPRA,  an  independent  sector  regulator;  enactment  of  the\nprivatization law, which protects the rights of the investors and\nconsumers; announcement of the draft labor policy; resolution\nof  the  IPP  issue  and  the  finalization  of  the  HUBCO  case;\namendment of the WAPDA Act to split WAPDA for privatization;\nderegulation  of  furnace  oil  prices;  adjustment  of  fuel  prices\nlinked to the international price fluctuations; and privatization of\nliquefied petroleum gas operations. A third mitigating factor is\nthe ADB\u2019s close monitoring of the implementation of the reform\nProgram,  with  the  World  Bank  and  IMF.  Finally,  adequate\nprovisions have been made to mitigate risks relating to social\naspects.  Since  the  reform  program  challenges  existing\neconomic interests, a major risk is weakened political resolve to\nimplement the Program at the required pace and sequencing of\nmacroeconomic and energy sector structural reforms. Political\ncommitment  to  reforms  could  waiver  in  the  face  of  strong\nopposition from interested groups. Another risk is that of social\ndiscontent  arising  from  the  difficult  economic  situation  and\nadjustment measures needed to weed out corruption and theft\nin the power sector. The economic and the political costs of the\n\u201cno-reform\u201d scenario in the energy sector are grave and the\nresulting consequences are unacceptable to the Government.\nWhile the risks involved in supporting a strong reform program\nin the energy sector are significant, they are less than the risks\nof not supporting such a program.", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation for the proposed\nloans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Energy Sector Restructuring Program (ESRP)\ncomprising (i) two program loans, one for $300 million and the other for SDR39,083,000 to\nsupport  policy  reforms  under  the  ESRP,  and  (ii)  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan  of\nSDR3,908,000 for capacity enhancement in the energy sector.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In April 1998, the Government of Pakistan requested the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) to provide a quick-disbursing policy-based loan facility to rectify the financial crisis in the\npower sector and meet part of the sector shortfalls and restructuring costs. In response, an ADB\nmission visited Pakistan during March-April 1998 to identify key issues, and to discuss with the\nGovernment the possible ADB assistance and develop the objective and scope of the ESRP.\nThe mission advised the Government that the further processing of the ESRP would depend on\nthe Government\u2019s implementation of policy reforms; formulation of a realistic, credible, and\nfeasible financial package for the restructuring of Water and Power Development Authority\n(WAPDA)  and  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation  (KESC);  unbundling,  restructuring  as\ncorporations  (corporatization),  and  commercialization  of  unbundled  WAPDA  entities;  steps\nleading  to  the  privatization  of  KESC  and  the  corporatized  WAPDA  entities;  operational\nindependence  of  the  sector  regulator;  electricity  tariff  adjustment  mechanism  including  a\nreduction in cross-subsidies; and resolution of the issue of the independent power producers\n(IPPs).\n3. A  fact-finding  mission  visited  Pakistan  from  21  April  to  6  May  1998  to  firm  up\nunderstanding of the program loan.  However, the processing of the ESRP was suspended\nfollowing the nuclear testing in May 1998, the subsequent bilateral sanctions, and suspension of\nassistance from international financial institutions.  Nonetheless, ADB effectively made use of\nthis period by fielding a number of follow-up missions to continue policy dialogue with the\nGovernment to resolve all pending issues and sought agreement on time-bound implementation\nof the reform measures. Since the ESRP is an integral element of the structural adjustment\nprogram  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  its  processing  recommenced  after  the\nresumption of Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)/Extended Fund Facility (EFF)\nprogram in January 1999. The Appraisal Mission1 visited Pakistan from 26 July to 17 August\n2000  to  finalize  the  agreement  with  the  Government.    The  final  agreements  reached  are\nreflected  in  the  Government\u2019s  development  policy  letter  and  the  attached  Policy  Matrix\n(Appendix 1).  The program framework is provided in Appendix 2.\nIII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA. Development Objectives, Strategies, and Plans\n4. Since taking power in October 1999, the new Government has accelerated the pace of\neconomic  reforms.  A  comprehensive  structural  reform  program  in  line  with  the  economic\n                                                \n1 The Mission comprised Sadiq H. Zaidi, Senior Project Engineer/Mission Leader; Rune Stroem, Senior Financial\nSpecialist; Rita O\u2019Sullivan, Counsel; S.B. Koh, Economist; Tomoyuki Kimura, Energy Sector Specialist; and Carol\nLitwin, Poverty Specialist.  K. Rahman, Manager, and M. Zijsvelt, Resident Representative, Pakistan Resident\nMission, provided support to the Mission and attended key meetings with the Government of Pakistan.", "2\nroadmap was announced by the new Government in December 1999, and a broad-based\npoverty reduction strategy is being prepared.\n5. The Government\u2019s formulation of a poverty reduction strategy takes into account the\ninterrelation of economic, social, and governance dimensions. A four-track approach has been\nidentified by the Government: (i) broadly based economic growth that provides efficient income\ngenerating opportunities for the poor and a pattern of growth that is relatively labor intensive; (ii)\nachievement of the highest possible growth path that is consistent with the available financial\nand human capital under a governance architecture that is both humane and efficient; (iii)\nimproved access to education, skills training, primary health care, nutrition, and other social\nservices that help the poor become productive employees or capable of starting small-scale\nbusiness ventures; and (iv) provision of safety nets for the vulnerable groups.\n6. The main focus of the Government\u2019s fiscal reforms is to improve revenue performance\nthrough broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration. In the recent past, the\nGovernment has introduced a number of tax measures, including (i) an on-the-spot assessment\nscheme in 13 cities to increase tax compliance, registration, and documentation; (ii) periodic\nadjustments of petroleum prices in line with international price developments and elimination of\nthe subsidy on furnace oil; (iii) increased registration under the goods and services tax (GST),\nwhich will be extended to cover the services sector; and (iv) reorganization and downsizing of\nthe Central Board of Revenue of the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  A number of additional fiscal\ninitiatives  are  also  under  consideration,  including  an  agricultural  income  tax,  and  a  more\nintegrated, client-based, and functional tax administration system will be introduced.\n7. In the financial sector, detailed privatization plans have been drafted and disposal of the\nremaining shares of national commercial banks and other state-owned financial institutions is\nproceeding. New managers from the private sector have been appointed in all but one of the\ndevelopment financial institutes. A program has also been designed to enhance the minimum\ncapital requirements together with necessary amendments in banking laws for this purpose.  In\naddition, the State Bank of Pakistan will be restructured to focus on its core operations such as\nmonetary policy, banking supervision and foreign exchange management. The new insurance\nlaw passed in June 2000 will increase financial soundness and help further growth in the sector.\nUnder assistance mainly from ADB,2 the Government has introduced major capital market\nchanges, including establishing a national clearing and settlement system, automating of stock\nexchange transactions, and setting up credit rating agencies to strengthen information flows and\nmarket efficiency.\n8. Privatization, which is urgently required to prevent further losses, has been accelerated\nrecently.  Initial  measures  have  included  (i)  a  privatization  law  (to  enhance  transparency,\naccountability, and efficiency in the privatization process) has been approved; (ii) two national\ncommercial banks and a partially privatized bank will soon be listed on the stock exchange; (iii)\nbidding for the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) business of three companies and the meter\nmanufacturing unit of a gas company is to be held by the end of 2000; and (iv) in the industrial\nsector, six units are to be liquidated or sold through the stock market before the end of June\n2001 and a large number of state-owned enterprise will be privatized in the next two years. The\nproposed  ESRP  loan  will  support  privatization  of  KESC  and  two  corporatized  entities  of\nWAPDA.  Under  ADB\u2019s  Loan  1576,  the  National  Investment  Trust  and  Mutual  Funds  of\nInvestment Corporation of Pakistan are to be privatized by the end of 2000.\n                                                \n2 Loan 1576-PAK: Capital Markets Development Program Loan, for $250 million, approved on 6 November 1997.", "3\nB.  Recent Macroeconomic Performance and Prospects\n1.  Recent Macroeconomic Performance\n9. The past two years have been difficult for Pakistan\u2019s economy.  Following the nuclear\ntests in late May 1998, economic sanctions magnified Pakistan\u2019s long standing socioeconomic\ndifficulties. IMF also suspended its ESAF-EFF package. The economy declined sharply due to\nthe erosion of investor confidence, the virtual cessation of private capital inflows, and the\nsuspension of new official development assistance. Consequently, Pakistan faced a severe\nforeign exchange crisis as reserves fell to $415 million or the equivalent of less than two weeks\nof imports in November 1998. To prevent the total collapse of the balance of payments, the\nGovernment adopted short-term measures including freezing foreign currency accounts held in\ndomestic banks, adopting a dual exchange rate system, and delaying the servicing of foreign\ndebt.\n10. IMF revived the ESAF-EFF in January 1999 after the partial waiving of sanctions in\nDecember 1998. Multilateral funding resumed at the same time. In late January 1999, the\nGovernment and bilateral creditors negotiated an agreement to reschedule official debt. In early\nJuly 1999, Pakistan concluded an agreement for rescheduling commercial loans valued at $877\nmillion.   In late September 2000, IMF and the Government reached a preliminary agreement for\na standby program, which is expected to be approved by the IMF Board in November 2000.\nInitially, the program will be for one year.  But the agreement could be subsumed into a Poverty\nReduction Growth Facility (PRGF) by mid-2001.  In addition, Pakistan would be accorded a one-\nyear debt rescheduling, since the present debt rescheduling agreements will expire on 31\nDecember 2000.\n11. Pakistan\u2019s economic performance during FY2000 showed some improvement. The new\nGovernment introduced a number of measures to stabilize the economy. Positive signs included\na modest recovery in economic growth, a fall in inflation rate, increased exports, and a relatively\nstable foreign exchange level.\n12. Real GDP grew by 4.8 percent in FY2000 as against 3.1 percent of the previous year.\nOne of the main reasons for this recovery was a significant improvement in agriculture, which\ngrew by 7.2 percent. A sharp recovery in bumper cotton and wheat crops and a good rice crop\nsupported high agriculture sector growth. The performance of manufacturing in general and\nlarge-scale manufacturing in particular appeared weak, as they grew by only 1.1 percent and\n-0.7  percent,  respectively.  This  weak  performance  was  mainly  due  to  a  decline  in  sugar\nproduction. The service sector grew by 4.5 percent during the period. The increase rate of the\nconsumer price index (CPI) declined to 3.6 percent during FY2000 as against 5.7 percent of the\nprevious year.\n13. Alongside these positive developments are several areas of concern that require serious\nGovernment attention in the short to medium term. First, fiscal deficit emerged as a major\nsource of macroeconomic imbalance. Although Pakistan succeeded in reducing its fiscal deficit\nfrom 7.7 percent of GDP in FY1998 to 6.5 percent in FY2000, the current size of the deficit itself\nis unsustainable. Future fiscal adjustment is essential for restoring macroeconomic stability.\nSecond, continued weaknesses in the tax revenue effort and substantial debt service payments\nconstrain policy choices, particularly by limiting much needed outlays for infrastructure and\nsocial sectors. In this context, the main focus of the Government\u2019s fiscal reform is to improve\nrevenue performance through broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration.\nAccording to the federal budget for FY2001 approved in June 2000, the fiscal deficit is projected", "4\nto decline to 4.5 percent in the current year, but it was subsequently revised to 5.0 percent after\ndiscussion with IMF.\n14. The fragile balance-of-payments situation remains one of the principal areas of concern.\nThe trade deficit reached $1.7 billion, doubled the Government\u2019s $800 million target for FY2000.\nAlthough exports expanded by 8.7 percent during the year, imports increased by 8.0 percent,\ndue largely to higher prices of petroleum and related products. The widened trade gap, coupled\nwith a negative resource transfer from funding agencies, have exerted pressure on the balance\nof payments. Foreign exchange reserves as of June 2000 totaled $1.39 billion, which is less\nthan two months of imports.\n15. Another  area  that  requires  immediate  attention  is  arresting  the  increasing  poverty.\nDeclining economic growth, severe macroeconomic imbalances, lack of social safety net, and\npoor  governance  in  the  1990s  have  had  adverse  effects  on  the  country\u2019s  poor  and  most\nvulnerable. The incidence of calorie-based poverty has increased from 17.3 percent in FY1988\nto 22.4 percent in FY1993 and further to 35.2 percent in FY1999.3\n16. The short-to-medium-term prospects for the Pakistan economy will depend on political\nstability and the pace of economic reforms. Above all, improving the quality of governance is\nessential for the success of reforms and a sustainable development program. Assuming that the\nGovernment  will  implement  major  structural  reforms  in  a  timely  manner  and  maintain\nmacroeconomic stability, GDP is projected to grow by 5.0 percent in FY2001. The inflation rate\nis expected to be around 4.5 percent on the assumption that monetary expansion will be around\n9.0 percent. The trade sector is expected to improve in FY2001, with 11.0 percent growth in\nexports  and  3.6  percent  increase  in  imports  owing  to  sustained  increase  in  agriculture\nproduction, revival of manufacturing sector, and stable prices of oil and its products. The trade\naccount is projected to be in deficit by $1.3 billion in FY2001, and thus the current account\ndeficit is expected to decline to 2.0 percent of GDP in FY2001 from 2.4 percent in FY2000.\n2.  Impact of Energy Sector Restructuring on the Economy\n17. The electricity and gas sector accounts for over 4.0 percent of GDP.  It is the third\nlargest commodity sector in the economy following agriculture and manufacturing. In FY2000\nthe energy sector grew by 7.8 percent, substantially higher than the overall GDP growth rate of\n4.8 percent. Given the importance of the energy sector, the restructuring program is expected to\nhave a significant impact on economic growth through a reduction of the budget deficit, a\nreduction of the current account deficit, increased efficiency in the energy sector, and improved\noverall resource allocation in the economy.\n18. The restructuring program is expected to enhance the efficiency of the energy sector\nthrough  the  introduction  of  competitive  market  forces  and  the  subsequent  reduction  in\ntransmission and distribution losses. This will help reduce production costs across all industries,\nincluding agriculture and manufacturing, in the medium to long term, which will contribute to a\nlower inflation rate and higher economic growth. Reduction in transmission and distribution\nlosses will also reduce corruption and waste of public resources.\n19. The effect of the restructuring program on the overall resource allocation in the economy\nis also expected to be significant. Allocation of Government funds to the energy sector diverts\npublic funds away from social sectors and activities which are more conducive for poverty\n                                                \n3 Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of the Government of Pakistan, September 2000.", "5\nreduction and fostering economic growth. For instance, the operating loss in FY2000 of KESC\nalone was PRs12.9 billion, i.e., over 70.0 percent of the total Government expenditure on social\nservices, 144.0 percent of the expenditure on education and 250.0 percent of the expenditure\non health. Although these funds are not fully fungible, it is evident that continuous allocation of\npublic resources to the energy sector crowds out public investments to other sectors of the\neconomy. Thus restructuring of the energy sector will lead to a more efficient allocation of public\nfunds, which will contribute to enhancing sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.\n20. The  inefficiencies  in  the  energy  sector  are  imposing  an  increasing  burden  on  the\nGovernment budget. Given the unsustainable fiscal deficit of 6.5 percent of GDP in FY2000, the\nGovernment does not have the resources to continuously inject funds into the energy sector. In\nFY2000, KESC had net loss of PRs12.9 billion, and  net liabilities PRs20.4 billion. Although\nWAPDA did not have net loss, in FY2000 the Government was forced to convert PRs36.3 billion\nof debt into equity and WAPDA had contingent liabilities to HUBCO and KAPCO of PRs31\nbillion. An idea of the size of these liabilities and losses can be had from the fact that the total\ntax  revenue  in  FY2000  was  PRs346  billion,  and  the  development  expenditure  was  only\nPRs100.6 billion. The Government is committed to reducing its fiscal deficit to 5.0 percent of\nGDP  in  FY2001,  and  3.5  percent  of  the  GDP  by  FY2003.  The  restructuring  program,  by\nreducing losses and facilitating privatization of KESC, will play a critical role in the achievement\nof these targets.\n21. The energy sector is highly import intensive in its input usage, particularly petroleum\nproducts. In FY2000, petroleum products and crude oil imports amounted to $2.8 billion, i.e.,\n27.2  percent  of  the  Pakistan\u2019s  total  imports.  If  the  transmission  and  distribution  losses  of\nWAPDA and KESC were reduced by 50.0 percent, Pakistan would have needed to import 13.0\npercent  less  of  petroleum  products  at  a  saving  of  over  $350  million.  The  energy  sector\nrestructuring program, besides helping to reduce the transmission and distribution losses, will\nalso  support  the  replacement  of  imported  petroleum  products  with  domestically  produced\nnatural gas. The substitution is projected to generate $3.0 billion in foreign exchange savings for\nthe government over the next 10 years, or $300 million a year. Thus the combined impact of the\nrestructuring program in reducing the current account deficit would be significant.\nIV.  THE ENERGY SECTOR\nA. Background and Recent Performance\n1.  Power Subsector\n22. Pakistan has two public sector power utilities: KESC, a predominantly Government-\ncontrolled public limited liability company, and WAPDA, a Government-owned statutory body.\nThe installed generation capacity of Pakistan\u2019s public sector power system is about 11,890\nmegawatts (MW) of which WAPDA\u2019s capacity is 9,950 MW (84.0 percent), KESC\u2019s at 1,800 MW\n(15.0 percent), and Karachi Nuclear Power Plant at 140 MW (1.0 percent). Of WAPDA\u2019s total\ncapacity of 9,950 MW, about 4,825 MW is from hydropower and 5,125 MW from thermal power.\nKESC\u2019s generation capacity is entirely thermal. Thus, of Pakistan\u2019s total generation capacity,\nabout 58.0 percent is thermal, 41.0 percent hydropower, and 1.0 percent nuclear.\n23. KESC was established in 1913 as a private corporation under the Indian Companies Act\nof 1882. The Government, through the Ministry of Water and Power (MWP) now controls its\nmanagement. Presently, KESC is majority owned by the Government, which holds a 93.0\npercent equity stake, controlled directly and indirectly through public sector organizations. The", "6\nremaining 7.0 percent of shares are privately held. KESC ranks among the top 15 Pakistani\ncompanies in terms of market capitalization and is listed on the Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore\nstock exchanges. KESC is a vertically integrated electric utility and supplies power to Karachi,\nPakistan\u2019s largest city and the country\u2019s commercial and financial capital. KESC\u2019s transmission\nand distribution lines span over 15,500 kilometers (km). Its extensive and relatively affluent\nfranchise area caters to 1.7 million customers and covers an estimated 6,000 square kilometer\n(km2), including nearby industrial areas in Sindh and Balochistan provinces. Of KESC\u2019s total\ninstalled  capacity,  its  available  capacity  has  recently  been  as  low  as  900  MW  due  to\nobsolescence of some of the plants and lack of reserve capacity to enable the units to be taken\nout of service for maintenance. However, since the last unit was installed in 1997, and with\nKESC  now  having  access  to  capacity  from  two  recently  completed  independent  power\nproducers (IPPs), the backlog of maintenance has been tackled and the available capacity now\namounts to about 1,400 MW.  This meets less than 70.0 percent of the energy demand. The\nbalance is met by purchasing electricity from WAPDA and small generation plants of other\nindustrial complexes in Karachi.\n24. WAPDA was created by an Act in 1958, as an autonomous body for the development\nand  use  of  the  water  and  power  resources  of  the  then  West  Pakistan  on  a  unified  and\nmultipurpose  basis.  WAPDA\u2019s  responsibility  covered  the  development  and  use  of  water\nresources and included activities related to irrigation, water supply and drainage, flood control,\nprevention  of  water  logging,  and  salinity  control.  WAPDA\u2019s  Power  Wing  functions  as  an\nintegrated electric power utility for the entire country, except Metropolitan Karachi, which is\nserviced by KESC. WAPDA has about 110,000 employees, most of whom work in the Power\nWing. WAPDA has 11 thermal power generation stations with a total capacity of 5,125 MW. The\nhydropower projects, such as Ghazi Barotha (under construction), Mangla, and Tarbela are\nmanaged by the Water Wing, since they are primarily operated to meet irrigation demands, with\nelectricity  as  a  secondary  output.  WAPDA\u2019s  installed  hydropower  capacity  of  4,825  MW\nrepresented 41.0 percent of its current total generation capacity. The power distribution function\nof WAPDA is carried out by eight area electricity boards, namely: Faisalabad, Gujranwala,\nHyderabad, Islamabad, Lahore, Multan, Peshawar, and Quetta. At present, the lines for the\ntransmission of power and the grid system for the entire country are owned, managed, and\noperated by WAPDA through its transmission and grid department. WAPDA provides electric\npower utility service to about 11.6 million customers.\n25. Additional Generation Capacity. Power consumption in Pakistan grew rapidly during\nthe 1970s and 1980s, at an average annual rate of over 9.0 percent, although it slowed\nsomewhat over the past 3-4 years as Pakistan has encountered economic difficulties. The most\nsignificant increase was in the domestic sector, the share of which tripled during that period.\nWhile the growth in electricity consumption has been strong, Pakistan\u2019s per capita electricity\nconsumption per year remains low at 320 kilowatt-hours (kWh), less than one quarter of the\naverage for the region as a whole. Also, close to half of the population remains without access\nto electricity services. An overview of key sector indicators is presented in Supplementary\nAppendix A. Since the 1980s, power supply lagged behind demand, resulting in major load\nshedding of up to 30 percent of peak demand. In the early 1990s, it was clear that, with demand\ngrowing at about 9.0 percent per year, WAPDA and KESC did not have the resources to\nincrease generation capacity at the rate required to eliminate load shedding and undertake\nessential  routine  maintenance  on  all  plants  in  the  system.  Faced  with  the  chronic  power\nshortages, the Government in 1994 initiated a study of Pakistan\u2019s future energy needs up to the\nyear 2020. The report highlighted that additional generation capacity of about 9,800 MW was\nurgently needed by the year 2002. Of this recommended additional capacity, 4,600 MW was\nalready under construction or in the early stage of planning and the balance of 5,200 MW was", "7\nrecommended to be implemented by the private sector. Under a low demand scenario, the\n5,200 MW additional capacity was projected to be reduced to 3,200 MW but increased to 7,200\nMW under a high demand scenario.\n26. Introduction of IPPs and Private Investment.  The Government formulated the 1994\npower policy and invited, for the first time, the IPPs to invest in the power sector in Pakistan.\nThe World Bank assisted the Government in formulating the framework of IPPs\u2019 involvement in\nthe power sector. The policy allowed full flexibility to the IPPs to bring capacity on line as quickly\nas  possible  at  predetermined  power  purchase  prices.  The  Government  guaranteed\nimplementation, fuel supply and power purchase. To attract the first private investment of the\nIPPs into the power sector and to cover the risks perceived by the investors, the Government\noffered generous tariffs. In 1993, construction started on Hub Power Plant Company (HUBCO),\nwith a capacity of 1,292 MW and a negotiated tariff based essentially on a \u201ccost plus\u201d approach.\n27. Power  Rates  for  IPPs.  The  Government  agreed  to  an  average  purchase  price  of\nelectricity from the IPPs for the first 10 years at $0.060/kWh which was subsequently increased\nto $0.065/kWh. However, high front-end loading of the tariffs to meet the developer\u2019s cash flow\nrequirements resulted in tariffs in the initial years being as high as $0.083/kWh. An additional\npremium of $0.0025/kWh for the first 10 years was also offered for projects commissioned by\n1997. Furthermore, a mechanism was provided for indexation of certain tariff components\nbased on the rupee\u2019s exchange rate against the US dollar, fuel price variation, and inflation. In\naddition to the generous private power purchase rates of the IPPs, the agreements stipulated\nthat if the Government bought less or no power due to lower demand, the Government (or\nWAPDA) would still pay the IPPs for 60.0 percent of their plant capacity. With these attractive\nGovernment incentives, 19 IPP projects arose and brought over $3.0 billion to install about\n3,500 MW capacity.  This does not include funds for HUBCO, which included financing from the\nWorld Bank and WAPDA\u2019s Kot Addu plant, which later was privatized and became Kot Addu\nPower Company (KAPCO).\n28.  Advantages and Disadvantages of the 1994 Power Policy.  The advantages of the\npolicy included quick implementation, and access to global capital and technology resources.\nThe  drawbacks  related  to  the  absence  of  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,\nunstaggered timing of the plants\u2019 commissioning, poor planning of the location of power plants,\nand the inappropriate choice of imported furnace oil fuel for the IPPs power plants. The policy\nhas been successful in rapidly bringing foreign capital for new power generation capacity, it also\nprovided guaranteed high energy prices to IPPs. The IPPs\u2019 new generation power plants were\nbased on imported fuel oil, and were licensed to be located far from the load centers in the\ncentral and northern areas of Pakistan, thus putting severe strain on the country\u2019s physical\ninfrastructure, including the electricity transmission system. With the commissioning of some\nIPP power plants in 1997, WAPDA and KESC purchased electricity from these IPPs. From\n1998, Pakistan has had excess capacity with the utilities contracted to purchase expensive IPP\nelectricity while their own plants are underutilized.\n29. Government Payments for Private Power Purchase.  The Government paid PRs35.6\nbillion ($0.7 billion) in FY1997 and PRs57.3 billion ($1.10 billion) in FY1998, to purchase power\nfrom the IPPs. Most of the payments went to two private sector power operators\u2013HUBCO and\nKAPCO, which together have a combined capacity of about 2,900 MW.  Since then, nine IPPs\nwith a total combined capacity of about 1,940 MW have started operating. The Government\nclaims that it is buying power from HUBCO at $0.118/kWh because of the \u201ccost plus\u201d provision\nof  the  tariffs  and  because  HUBCO\u2019s  operations  are  curtailed  to  about  45.0  percent  of  its\ncapacity, since WAPDA is not in a position to purchase much of HUBCO\u2019s output. When all the", "8\nIPPs are commissioned, the Government (or WAPDA) will have to pay them about PRs300\nbillion ($5.8 billion) over the next three years (up to FY2003) for electricity, all of which may not\nbe used. The payment to the IPPs has adversely affected the Government financing of other\npublic enterprises in the power sector. The Government contends that the $0.065/kWh rate of\nthe IPPs, as per their agreement with the previous Government, is unaffordable for a country\nlike Pakistan. As a result of the large payments to IPPs during FY1996 and FY1997, WAPDA\nand KESC have faced serious liquidity problems.  KESC has defaulted on its fuel payments to\nthe Pakistan State Oil Company (PSOC), Oil and Gas Development Corporation (OGDC), and\nthe oil refineries.  WAPDA was the root cause of the National Refinery defaulting on its loan\npayment to the Islamic Development Bank. The previous Government pressured the IPPs into\nlowering the tariffs and to coerce a confession of corrupt practices in securing approvals of their\nprojects. A summary of the IPP controversy is presented in Supplementary Appendix B. The\nfunding agencies, including ADB, advised the Government that it should delink the corruption\nissue from the tariff structure and resolve the IPP issue in an amicable and business-like\nenvironment, and within the framework of contractual agreements.\n30. Power Subsector Performance.  The power sector in Pakistan has a relatively poor\noperational performance and retail tariffs averaging below the long-run marginal cost, due to\nsubsidization of power to most residential and agricultural consumers. Notwithstanding this, the\nsector has consistently recorded profits in the past. This is largely due to the low book value of\nthe operating assets resulting in low depreciation expenses, and the Government\u2019s financing of\nthe sector on terms well below market rates.  In FY1996, WAPDA\u2019s profits represented 36.0\npercent of operating revenues. The situation, however, changed dramatically in FY1997 with the\ncommissioning  of  IPPs  whose  power  cost  almost  twice  as  much  as  WAPDA\u2019s  thermal\ngeneration or four times WAPDA\u2019s average hydro-thermal generation. This was compounded by\ndeterioration in operating efficiencies, particularly for KESC, and a two-fold increase in domestic\ncost  of  fuel.  As  a  result,  the  sector  recorded  losses  in  FY1997,  with  WAPDA\u2019s  losses\nrepresenting 2.0 percent of revenues and KESC\u2019s losses at 34.0 percent of revenues. The\nsector\u2019s total liabilities amounted to PRs233.0 billion ($4.5 billion) as of 30 June 1997. Also, the\nconstruction by WAPDA of the Ghazi Barotha and Chashma hydropower projects slowed to a\nvirtual halt due to lack of counterpart funds. The status of the Ghazi Barotha and Chasma\nhydropower  projects  is  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  The  sector\u2019s  persistent\noperational inefficiencies, high cost of operations, and retail tariffs that do not cover the cost of\noperations,  have  eroded  the  operating  margins,  profitability,  and  cash  flows.  These  have\nresulted  in  the  sector\u2019s  weak  self-financing,  debt  service,  and  liquidity  capabilities  and  its\ncorresponding noncompliance with financial health covenants with ADB.\n31. KESC\u2019s  performance  has  deteriorated  significantly  in  recent  years.  Its  equity  has\nbecome negative due to accumulated losses since FY1998. KESC\u2019s long-term debt in FY2000\nrepresented 103.9 percent of total fixed assets and its current ratio is at an alarming level of\n0.53  times.  KESC  has  been  unable  to  generate  sufficient  cash  flow  to  meet  its  capital\nexpenditure requirement, debt service obligations and a part of operational expenses. KESC\u2019s\nworsening financial health is threatening its operations, adversely impacting the viability of the\nenergy sector, and causing cash flow problems to its fuel suppliers, which is affecting their\nprivatization. Supplementary Appendix D summarizes KESC\u2019s financial performance.\n32. The main factors driving KESC\u2019s net losses and weak cash flows are excessive levels of\ntransmission and distribution losses, the high cost of fuel (which has not been matched by\nadequate adjustments in tariff levels), the increased purchase and high cost of electricity from\nIPPs, and poor revenue collection and high levels of uncollected receivables. Transmission and\ndistribution losses have been on the rise and in FY2000 were estimated at about 60.0 percent.", "9\nThis high level of losses, although partly attributed to technical constraints, is primarily due to\ntheft. KESC\u2019s full dependence on thermal generation makes it sensitive to increases in the cost\nof fuel.  Fuel expenses accounted for an increasing share of operating revenues. In addition, the\nprice of furnace oil, which is KESC\u2019s main fuel, has more than doubled since FY1996. This\nsignificantly eroded KESC\u2019s operating margins and profitability over time.  The current plans of\nthe National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) to introduce automatic adjustments\nin tariff structure for passthrough items, are expected to help alleviate KESC\u2019s sensitivity to\nadverse movements in fuel prices and to achieve a better congruence between KESC\u2019s revenue\nbase and cost structure.\n33. KESC currently buys power from GUL AHMED, Karachi Nuclear Power Plant, Pakistan\nSteel Mills Corporation, and TAPAL Energy. While power from Independent Power Producers\n(IPPs) only accounted for 10.4 percent of operating revenues in FY1996, it was about 46.4\npercent  of  operating  revenues  in  FY2000.  Furthermore,  KESC\u2019s  average  IPP  costs  have\nincreased from PRs128.26/kWh in FY1996 to PRs329.78/kWh in FY2000. This substantial\nincrease in IPP costs, was much higher than the yearly increases in average revenues, also\ncontributed to reductions in KESC\u2019s operating profits and profitability. KESC\u2019s poor revenue\ncollection is reflected in its large receivables in FY2000 of PRs11.7 billion. KESC is required\nunder ADB\u2019s proposed Program loan to improve its liquidity position by reducing receivables to\n3.0 months of energy sales by the end of FY2003.\n34. WAPDA\u2019s financial performance started to deteriorate in FY1997, and has been unable\nto meet its financial covenants. Supplementary Appendix E outlines the status of WAPDA and\nKESC\u2019s  performance  target  compliance.  The  primary  factors  driving  WAPDA\u2019s  declining\nliquidity, cash flow, and profitability relate to its poor bill collection and high level of receivables\nfrom federal and provincial governments due to their inability to pay, increasing purchase from\nIPPs at price levels much higher than average tariffs, high levels of system losses, large\nincreases in fuel costs, inadequate tariff increases, and decreased growth in power demand.\nHowever, in FY1999, WAPDA recovered net income with substantial improvements of key\nfinancial ratios.\n35. As  of  30  June  2000,  the  cumulative  stock  of  federal  and  provincial  government\nreceivables (including all arrears) grew to PRs29 billion from PRs19 billion on 30 June 1998. To\naddress WAPDA\u2019s liquidity crunch, the Government converted WAPDA\u2019s pending debt service\nliability of PRs36.3 billion into equity in FY2000. Since then, WAPDA has been current on all its\npayment obligations.  WAPDA\u2019s cost of power from IPPs represented 48.5 percent of revenues\nin FY1998. In FY1998 for example, the unit cost of IPP-generated power was at least 4.2 times\nWAPDA\u2019s average unit generation cost (thermal and hydro) and about 2.1 times WAPDA\u2019s unit\nthermal generation cost (Supplementary Appendix A). Since FY1999, due to a dispute about the\npower purchase agreements (PPAs) with HUBCO and KAPCO, WAPDA has paid reduced rates\nto these two power suppliers under court orders. Consequently, WAPDA carries a contingent\nliability of about PRs26 billion as of 30 June 2000. WAPDA\u2019s fuel costs for its thermal power\nplants have steadily increased. Its fuel oil cost per unit of thermal power generated doubled from\nPRs84.1/kWh  in  FY1996  to  PRs161.06/kWh  in  FY1998,  and  rose  to  PRs181.03/kWh  in\nFY2000. Increase in fuel cost also contributed to higher power purchase cost from the IPPs,\nwhich  were  all  thermal-fired.  Supplementary  Appendix  D  summarizes  WAPDA\u2019s  financial\nperformance.\n36. Because public and private consumers are not paying their bills to WAPDA and KESC,\nthey have been unable to service obligations to fuel suppliers and loan creditors. As of June\n2000, the total arrears of the government and private customers owing to WAPDA amounted to", "10\n$562 million and $483 million, respectively. This forced WAPDA to default on its debt service\nliability to the Government, and its loan arrears amounting to approximately $700 million were\nconverted into equity in FY2000. Although WAPDA is current on all fuel and debt service\nobligations,  its  substantial  arrears  from  the  public  sector  are  a  formidable  obstacle  for\nrestoration of financial soundness. Having been strongly urged by the ADB and the WB to\nresolve this issue, the GOP settled all the public sector arrears developed from January 1999 to\nJune 2000. It was also decided by the GOP that the arrears prior to January 1999 should be\nwritten off except for the arrears from the Government of Sindh. To KESC, receivable arrears\nfrom private consumers amounting to $299 million have been a major cause for its liquidity\nproblem.  KESC  has  been  unable  to  service  its  payment  obligations  to  fuel  suppliers,  the\nGovernment, and WAPDA even after a comprehensive debt restructuring in FY1998. As a\nresult, KESC\u2019s payable arrears as of June 2000 amount to $379 million comprising fuel and\npower purchase arrears of $308 million and loan arrears of $71 million. The major elements of\nthe sector\u2019s debt as of June 2000 are shown in Appendix 3.\n2.  Natural Gas and Petroleum\n37. The natural gas and petroleum in Pakistan have traditionally been controlled by the\nGovernment, which acts as owner, regulator, and policy maker.  The Ministry of Petroleum and\nNatural Resources (MOPNR) is the administrative arm of the Government, and is responsible\nfor all aspects relating to natural gas and oil.  Pakistan has indigenous reserves of natural gas,\noil, and coal, which provide 61.0 percent (24.7 million tons of oil equivalent [toe]) of the total net\nprimary energy supplies of 40.4 million toe. The primary energy supply mix of Pakistan in\nFY1998 consisted of oil (43.9 percent including petroleum products), natural gas (37.3 percent),\nhydroelectricity (13.0 percent), coal (5.1 percent), and other sources such as LPG and nuclear\nelectricity (0.7 percent). A number of public and private firms are involved in exploring for and\nproducing oil and gas in Pakistan, and a number of international firms are involved in a large\nnumber  of  joint-venture  partnership  operations  with  Government  entities.  The  refining  and\nmarketing of oil products are dominated by international and domestic stakeholders with public\nand private ownership interest. The two state-owned enterprises, Sui Southern Gas Company\n(SSGC)  and  Sui  Northern  Gas  Pipeline  Company  (SNGPL),  undertake  the  purification,\ntransmission, and distribution of natural gas in the country.  Pakistan has imported 4.0 million\ntons of oil and 11 million tons of petroleum products during the FY2000, at a cost of $2.2 billion,\nto meet its energy needs.  The amount of imported fuel oils will increase due to the increased\ndemand  for  fuel  by  the  power  generation  plants.    This  trend  can  only  be  prevented  if  a\ncomprehensive plan is instituted to convert the power plants using the high-cost fuel oil to\nindigenous sources of energy such as natural gas.  The natural gas is being transmitted and\ndistributed by SSGC in the southern part of Pakistan, and by SNGPL for the middle and\nnorthern part of the country.  The combined transmission network is about 7,600 km of high\npressure and about 50,000 km of distribution mains.  The total customer bases for SSGC and\nSNGPL are 1.2 million and 1.5 million, respectively.  A number of new natural gas fields have\nbeen discovered in Pakistan, and are expected to increase the reserves by 20.0 to 25.0 percent.\nThe gas sales agreements have been signed for the supply of an additional 600 million cubic\nfeet per day (mmcfd) by December 2002, from the new gas fields.  In addition, a number of\npotentially rich areas have yet to be explored for further discoveries of gas fields. The additional\ngas supply must be effectively and economically used to facilitate the country\u2019s economic\nrecovery. The private sector is negotiating with the Government for capital investment in the\ntransmission networks system of the country.\n38. While the natural gas and petroleum subsector has great potential to expand and meet\nPakistan\u2019s growing demand, the recent performance of the sector has been less than optimal.", "11\nThe pace of development and private sector investment in the subsector have been lower than\nanticipated due to the inappropriate policy framework, government interference, and inefficient\nutility operations.  The situation is aggravated by Pakistan\u2019s prevailing political and economic\nsituation.  The resulting increased dependency on imported furnace oil and petroleum products\nhas caused the country\u2019s current account deficit to expand to unmanageable proportions.  The\nsituation is projected to worsen as the lack of available commercial energy is likely to become a\nserious constraint on Pakistan\u2019s economic recovery, and the quantity of imported energy will\ncontinue to increase unless domestic natural gas and oil resources are discovered and brought\ninto production quickly. Because of large capital requirements in the subsector, the Government\nhas formulated an attractive package of incentives to encourage the private sector to invest in\nthe further development of oil and gas fields, and to undertake exploration, which involves\ncapital risk.  These measures are succeeding.\nB.  Issues and Constraints\n39. Governance.  Governance has emerged as an increasingly important issue in the power\nsector in Pakistan. In recent years, worsening problems in this area have had a major impact on\nmacroeconomic performance and have hindered the effectiveness and sustainability of the\npower sector. Specifically, weak governance has resulted in inefficient utility operations, power\ntheft, illegal power supply, reduced billing and tariff collections, and nonpayment of arrears.\nThese corrupt practices opened the way for massive waste and contributed to the build up of\nthe financial insolvency of the public utilities. While it is difficult to calculate the exact amount of\nelectricity theft, the electricity stolen (used but not paid for) in WAPDA and KESC during 1999\namounted  to  about  $400-600  million  and  $200-250  million,  respectively.  A  theft  of  this\nmagnitude  could  be  possible  only  through  corruption  and  malpractice  at  all  levels  of  the\norganizational hierarchy, the government, politicians, labor, and the society in general.\n40. Institutional  Weaknesses.    The  Pakistan  power  sector  has  been  affected  by\ninstitutional and organizational weaknesses that have led to decisions on investments, electricity\ntariff determination, and appointment of senior management and staff becoming increasingly\npoliticized.  The  organizations  of  WAPDA  and  KESC  have  degenerated  into  unwieldy,\novercentralized, and multi-layered bureaucracies, dominated by political expediency, where\nefficiency  and  quality  of  service  continue  to  decline.  WAPDA\u2019s  scope  has  become\noverextended, as it has responsibilities for water and irrigation, developing the private power\nprogram, and planning and operating the power system. Even with 110,000 employees in\nWAPDA and about 12,200 in KESC, responsiveness to customers leaves much to be desired.\nOver  time,  lack  of  financial  and  commercial  skills  have  become  major  obstacles  to  the\naccountability, quick decision-making, and commercial orientation needed to deal with IPPs.\nInstitutional malaise was most obvious in the recent abrupt decline in financial performance,\nblackouts, and high levels of losses and stolen electricity (often the result of collusion between\nWAPDA  and  KESC  staff  and  consumers).  Consequently,  WAPDA  and  KESC  lost  the\nconfidence of their customers, financiers, and the Government.\n41. Tariff Structure and Subsidy.  Until 1998, the Government controlled the tariff setting.\nThe  successive  governments  in  Pakistan  provided  electricity  at  low  cost  to  consumers,\nparticularly the domestic consumers and agriculture.\n42. One of the major issues affecting the power sector was the tariff structure, which was not\nbased on a regional and consumer-specific long-run marginal cost (LRMC) but was used as an\ninstrument to achieve political and socioeconomic objectives. This resulted in a uniform tariff\nstructure for WAPDA and KESC, although KESC depended on all thermal generation, which is", "12\ninherently costlier than WAPDA\u2019s hydro-thermal generation. Thus, increases in fuel costs affect\nKESC much more than WAPDA. Furthermore, over the last several years, the Government did\nnot adjust the level and structure of tariffs to the new cost structure of the public utilities.\nFollowing a decline in real electricity tariffs and a severe financial crisis in the power sector, the\nGovernment announced in March 1998 a weighted average tariff increase of 21.0 percent. Then\nin March 1999, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) approved a further\ntariff  increase  of  9.4  percent.    The  lifeline  tariff  of  50  kWh  consumption  per  month  is\nPRs1.40/kWh ($0.0270/kWh) and the average tariffs for residential, commercial, and public\nlighting  sectors  are  PRs3.89  ($0.0753)/kWh,  PRs7.20  ($0.1393)/kWh,  and  PRs5.88\n($0.1137)/kWh,  respectively.    The  tariff  for  the  industrial  sector  is  PRs3.55-4.82  ($0.0686-\n0.0932)/kWh.  For agriculture, there are flat rate tariffs and metered rate tariffs, but the recovery\nis very low. The large cross-subsidy between agriculture consumers is provided by the sector\nitself, and not by the Government. The tariff structure after the March 1999 increase is shown in\nAppendix 4.  NEPRA, the sector regulator, is addressing these issues to rectify the situation.\nUnder  the  directive  of  NEPRA,  the  tariff  applications  submitted  to  NEPRA  by  KESC  and\nWAPDA address the issue of cross-subsidy by targeting average domestic and agricultural\ntariffs to rise more than commercial and industrial tariffs. In addition, WAPDA continues to install\nmeters on the agriculture tubewells and charge tariffs as per the meter reading instead of the\nflat rate currently in practice.\n43. Similarly, the tariff structure in the natural gas and petroleum subsectors are not the true\ncost of exploration, production, transmission, and distribution.  While the gas producers\u2019 prices\nunder the 1994 and 1997 petroleum policy are linked to the international price of crude and fuel\noil, the retail gas prices set by the Government for SSGC and SNGPL have been without any\nadjustments for a few years.  As a result, about 40.0 percent of the natural gas is sold by SSGC\nand SNGPL to consumers below the cost of supply.  This shortfall is funded by the Government\ngas development surcharge.  These two companies recover a portion of the losses through a\nfixed rate of return on equity formula, and the balance of the shortfalls is provided by the\nGovernment.  To remove these distortions,  the Government is in the process of deregulating\nthe prices in the natural gas and petroleum subsectors.  The sector regulator is also required to\naddress the issue of sector cross subsidy.\nC. Government Objectives and Strategy\n44. The Government became aware of the shortcomings of the 1994 policy and with the\nassistance from ADB4 drafted a new policy that was approved by the cabinet on 1 April 1998.\nUnder this policy, all future power plants will be developed by the private sector on the basis of\ncompetitive tendering. The policy will promote the use of indigenous energy sources (initially\nhydropower and coal) by inviting proposals for projects for development in accordance with a\nleast-cost generation expansion plan. Unsolicited bids for projects, i.e., those not the subject of\ninvitations, will be entertained, but under strict quality control and subject to competition. The\nnew policy also attempts to simplify the bidding, evaluation and licensing process under the\nPrivate Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB). The Government, under the new policy, decided to\nrestructure the power sector and approved the strategic plan that envisaged that KESC will be\nprivatized, and WAPDA separated into independent corporate entities responsible for thermal\nand hydropower generation, transmission, dispatch, and distribution.  These corporate entities\nare to be privatized.\n                                                \n4 SSTA No. 2809-PAK: Private Hydropower Policy Study, Final Report issued in February 1998.", "13\n45. The Government recognizes that domestic oil and natural gas supply must be expanded\nto reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported oil.  Priority is being given to the exploration,\ndevelopment, and exploitation of oil and natural gas reserves, and the installation of additional\noil refinery, gas treatment, transmission, and distribution facilities.  Accordingly, the Government\nstrategy calls for (i) the process of exploration and development of oil and gas fields to be\naccelerated,  and  increased  foreign  investment  in  this  sector  to  be  encouraged;  (ii)  the\ndevelopment of recently discovered, large reservoirs of gas to be expedited; (iii) regulatory\nauthority to be established for the orderly operations and development of the natural gas and\npetroleum subsectors; (iv) conversion of power plants from furnace oil to gas to be encouraged;\n(v) upstream infrastructure including pipelines to be developed for efficient transportation of\nimports  of  hydrocarbons  and  the  discovered  resources;  (vi)  the  petroleum  sector  to  be\nderegulated and the privatization process expedited for greater efficiency, for private sector\ninvestment, and for retirement of public debt; (vii) margins of oil marketing companies to be\nrationalized so that they can invest in storage and other infrastructure for oil; and (viii)  the price\nof LPG to be deregulated and the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to be encouraged. The\nGovernment  is  establishing  a  Petroleum  Regulatory  Board  (PRB),  an  independent  sector\nregulator, which is a prerequisite for petroleum sector reforms.\nD. External Assistance to the Sector\n46. During FY1984 to FY1997, multilateral and bilateral assistance to the power sector in\nPakistan amounted to about $7.5 billion. The major sources were ADB, Japan, and World Bank,\nwhich together provided more than half of the official external assistance. The assistance from\nADB was to both KESC and WAPDA, while the World Bank mainly provided assistance to\nWAPDA. Supplementary Appendix F presents donor assistance to the sector. A key policy\nthrust pursued through coordination of aid agencies has been to evolve a strategy for the\nprivatization of the power sector.  The policy matrix prepared for the reform program in the\nsector has been a joint effort of the ADB, World Bank, and Government, with clear delineation of\nthe division of labor between the two multilateral institutions.\n1.  Funding Agency Coordination\n47. ADB  has  carried  out  policy  dialogue  in  the  sector  in  close  coordination  with  other\nagencies, particularly World Bank and IMF, on many common policy covenants. Main areas\ncovered  under  the  policy  dialogue  include  restructuring  of  the  sector  and  its  institutions,\nenhanced  private  sector  role,  integrated  operations  of  WAPDA  and  KESC  systems,\nrationalization and enhancement of tariffs, energy efficiency and demand-side management,\nreduction of transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, and reduction of accounts receivables.\nWhile ADB can claim significant policy and institution-building assistance to the sector, progress\nhas significantly slowed down in recent years due to political instability, frequent changes in\ngovernment,  and  the  recent  economic  crisis.  The  political  and  law  and  order  problems  in\nKarachi have also affected the progress on KESC\u2019s restructuring and privatization.  The World\nBank is currently formulating a structural adjustment loan (SAL) for Pakistan with multisectoral\nfocus, to be approved in the near future, subject to a Government-IMF agreement on the PRGF\nor similar activity.  The energy sector (power and natural gas) will be a major component of the\nSAL.\n2.  Cofinancing\n48. ADB has vigorously followed the cofinancing opportunities in the energy sector with\ngood results. About $204 million of private cofinancing (by Citibank, and Export-Import Bank)", "14\nhas been mobilized for the public sector program and $45 million in private mobilized in 1996 for\ncofinancing ADB\u2019s private sector Fauji Kabirwala Power Co. Ltd. Project, one of the IPPs.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n1.  ADB Operations\n49. Since the start of the ADB operations in Pakistan in 1968, total lending to the energy\nsector in Pakistan amounts to about $2.7 billion, of which $2.1 billion to the power subsector\nand $0.6 billion to the natural gas and petroleum subsectors.  The lending to the energy sector\naccount for about 28.0 percent of total lending to the country.  Three-fourths of the assistance to\nthe power subsector ($1,575 million for 13 loans) has been provided to WAPDA and the rest to\nKESC. The ADB has been the major source of external assistance to the energy sector in\nPakistan, having provided about one-third of total external resources to the sector. The ADB is\nalso by far the main source of external assistance to KESC. In power generation, the ADB has\nsignificantly  contributed  to  major  multi-donor  undertakings  such  as  the  Tarbela  and  Ghazi\nBarotha Hydropower schemes. While lending to the sector has been significant, non-lending\nactivities also has been important with a total of $7.92 million provided for 27 TAs. Main areas\ncovered included tariff rationalization and integration, management information systems, power\ngeneration  coordination,  thermal  power  plant  maintenance,  institutional  strengthening  and\nrestructuring, and privatization.\n2.  ADB Strategy\n50. Due to its significance to Pakistan\u2019s overall economic recovery, the energy sector is\nrecognized in ADB\u2019s country operational strategy as a primary area for policy intervention.\nADB\u2019s sector strategy recommend high selectivity in new public sector investments, with priority\ngiven  to  creating  a  favorable  environment  for  privatization  and  private  sector  involvement.\nPriority areas include (i) increased energy efficiency, on both supply and demand sides; (ii)\noptimization of the share of hydropower in the generation mix and support to the development of\npublic-private sector partnerships in hydropower generation; (iii) balanced energy generation,\ntransmission,  and  distribution;  and  (iv)  continued  interventions  for  sector  restructuring,\nrationalization of tariffs, and enhanced private sector participation. The country operational\nframework  places  additional  emphasis  on  aspects  of  weak  governance  and  portfolio\nperformance. Both of these issues are important in the energy sector. The plan for Pakistan\u2019s\nenergy sector up to the year 2003 is presented in Appendix 5. It shows the intermediate\nmeasures taken, the achievements up to 2000, and the targets for 2003.\n3.  Lessons Learned\n51. Ten power projects approved up to 1983 have been postevaluated. All of the projects\nwere  classified  as  generally  successful.  The  postevaluation  findings  show  an  average\nimplementation delay of 2.4 years (78.0 percent). Five of the projects experienced an average\ncost  overrun  of  about  82.0  percent,  and  the  other  five  an  underrun  of  28.0  percent.  The\npostevaluations draw attention to the need for in-depth analysis of all technical issues before a\nproject is formulated, and the need to comprehensively review cost estimates at appraisal. ADB-\nfinanced projects approved after 1983 reflect improved performance.  However, KESC and\nWAPDA have been unable to meet the system loss targets, and the financial covenants due to\ninadequate tariff adjustments.  The tariff adjustments based on social equity and affordability\nconsiderations have led to a lack of commercial focus and affected the capacity of these two\nutilities to produce sufficient funding from internally generated sources to meet all expansion,", "15\nrehabilitation, and reinforcement requirements.  The utilities also lacked focused leadership and\nmanagement practices as well transparency in operational and financial matters. Most of the\nADB-financed projects use the sector-loan approach, which allows considerable flexibility in\nselection of subprojects, and the use of consultants for formulating the subprojects. As a result,\ncost overruns have been greatly reduced. However, slow project implementation remains a\nproblem.  Other  causes  for  implementation  delays  are  slow  appointment  of  consultants,\nbureaucratic procedures, organizational and institutional weaknesses, changes in project scope,\nand shortages of qualified staff.\n52. Three main lessons can be learned from ADB\u2019s involvement in the power sector in\nPakistan.  First,  continued  weak  governance  was  mainly  due  to  the  absence  of  a  sector\nregulator. The funding agencies, after the initial period of financial assistance to the energy\nsector, should have insisted upon the creation of independent sector regulators. The prevailing\nfinancial and operational crisis in the energy sector could have been averted if the sector was\nregulated by independent regulators. Second, a collective effort of the funding agencies should\nhave  been  exerted  to  enable  private  sector  participation  after  the  initial  years  of  official\nassistance to the Government for the energy sector. This would have introduced competition\nand resulted in the efficiency gains. Third, the funding agencies, including ADB, should have\ninvolved civil society to make them aware of the overall operation of the energy sector and\npromote the consumer advocacy groups. These issues are the fundamental components of the\nProgram.\nV.  THE ENERGY SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n53. Pakistan\u2019s energy sector is facing a financial crisis which basically stem from weak\ngovernance,  political  interference  in  decision-making,  poor  staff  morale,  and  disregard  of\nprudent business practices. The worsening problems in these areas have had a major impact\non  the  financial  performance  of  the  utilities  and  have  hindered  the  effectiveness  and\nsustainability of the energy sector. Weak governance has resulted in inefficient utility operations,\npower theft, reduced billing and collection, and nonpayment of arrears. These practices have\naffected the poor segment of the population more than the affluent and contributed to the\nfinancial crisis in the sector. The absence of an immediate policy response for the energy sector\nwould have serious economic repercussions. Therefore, radical reforms and tough adjustment\nmeasures, including market-driven systems, are needed to restore viability in the sector and to\nmake it self-sustaining. ADB support of the Government\u2019s initiatives for structural reforms in the\nenergy sector is considered essential given the urgent need to introduce competition as the\ndriving  force  for  improvement  and  private  sector  participation  as  a  vehicle  for  creating  a\ncompetitive environment. Ensuring a stable supply of energy is essential for the country\u2019s\neconomic recovery, which will result in additional job-generating activities for the poor as well.\nThe Program provides a sound basis for the Government to carry out reforms and to restructure\nthe  energy  sector.  The  development  of  a  competitive  electricity  market  under  the  reform\nprogram will result in efficiency gains that will have a positive impact on poverty reduction.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n54. The ADB Program for energy sector restructuring seeks to bring together the measures\nto reform the energy sector in Pakistan, speed-up the actions needed for its sustainable growth,\nincrease efficiency in the use of resources and improve customer focus in the delivery of\nservices. The ultimate goal is sector economic efficiency and consumer satisfaction. The reform", "16\nstrategy is to restructure the power sector by breaking up the sector\u2019s monolithic vertically\nintegrated power utilities; facilitating implementation of larger number of private power projects,\ntransmission, and distribution facilities; and introducing market-based reforms into the sector. To\nachieve these objectives, the sector is to be \u201cunbundled,\u201d the state-owned assets in generation,\ndistribution, and transmission to be sold as separate business entities to the private sector to\nminimize the cost of electricity by matching supply and demand under market-based conditions.\n55. The  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  shared  plan  is  to  move  the  power  sector  from  an\ninefficient state-controlled monopoly to a competitive, market-driven system in order to produce\nthe highest level of customer satisfaction. The strategy is to include integration of WAPDA and\nKESC  into  the  restructured  power  sector.  The  Program  envisions  that  the  Government\u2019s\nfinancial support to the energy sector, including guarantees, would be phased out except as a\nlast resort, e.g., for large, risky projects, or to meet social and environmental objectives such as\nsupplying energy to rural communities. Thus, a fully competitive power sector as envisaged\nunder the restructuring program will consist of (i) competitive generation with independent\nsystem operator(s) and a bulk power market; (ii) unbundled, open and nondiscriminating access\nto transmission and distribution services; and (iii) an independent regulatory body for effective\nmarket governance, setting sector standards, ensuring competition in the sector, setting tariffs\nincluding eliminating cross subsidy, and licensing approvals. This will enable the Government to\nachieve the longer term perspective of economic efficiency and consumer satisfaction. To\nachieve these improvements, consumers must be aware of the operations of the power sector,\nand the consumer advocacy group needs to be strengthened to increase consumer awareness.\nThese activities will result in better dialogue and enhance the role of the regulatory body. The\nProgram includes the engagement of a public relations firm to implement an educational and\npublicity campaign to explain to the public in general and to WAPDA and KESC employees the\nGovernment\u2019s  restructuring  and  privatization  program  and  the  resulting  benefits  from  such\nactivities.\n56. The long-term goal of the ADB\u2019s intervention is to ensure a self-sustaining, efficient and\ncompetitive power sector able to provide required quantities of quality power at least cost to the\nconsumer. In order to achieve this, the Program will focus on the seven key areas of reforms: (i)\nenhancing governance; (ii) enhancing the legal and regulatory framework and strengthening of\nthe capacity of the power sector regulator; (iii) financial restructuring and privatization of KESC;\n(iv) restructuring of WAPDA and privatization of corporatized entities; (v) enabling a competitive\nelectricity  market;  (vi)  resolving  the  IPP  issues  and  HUBCO  and  KAPCO  cases;  and  (vii)\nenhancing reform in the natural gas and petroleum subsector. Appendix 1 outlines the Program\nand its timetable.\nC.  Policy Framework and Actions\n1.  Enhancing Governance\n57. Because weak governance is one of the major causes of the financial crisis in the power\nsector, the Government has taken action to strengthen and expedite the accountability process.\nKey elements of the Government\u2019s action plan, using the military services, include (i) ensuring\neffective  law  and  order  in  KESC  and  WAPDA  franchise  areas;  (ii)  dismantling  illegal\nconnections and prosecuting offenders in civil courts; and (iii) disconnecting power supplies to\nall consumers with notices of legal action to those who do not pay their bills, including the elite\nand the politicians. These Government actions have provided encouraging financial results,\nespecially to WAPDA, and have reduced WAPDA\u2019s peak demand by about 1,000 MW.  The\nactions are expected to reduce the same demand by another 2,000 MW by June 2001. In", "17\naddition, KESC and WAPDA have instituted measures to reduce theft and improve the overall\noperational and financial performance (Appendix 6).\n58. The results through army intervention may not be sustainable when the army withdraws.\nThe  improvement  will  last  only  when  the  public  utilities  are  privatized.    Thus,  appropriate\nreforms  and  necessary  adjustment  measures,  including  privatization  of  the  utilities,  are\nexpected to help weed out corrupt practices and political interference. The expanded role of the\nsector regulator under the Program will also ensure good governance and efficient performance.\nThese measures will result in efficiency gains and will minimize the need for frequent excessive\ntariff adjustment, thereby providing a positive impact on poverty reduction.\n2. Enhancing the Legal and Regulatory Framework and Strengthening NEPRA\n59. Through  the  reform  Program,  NEPRA  was  established  as  an  independent  sector\nregulator  under  the  Act  of  the  Parliament.    A  four-member  board  was  appointed  and  the\nchairperson is expected to be appointed in January 2001.  NEPRA has taken important steps to\ncomplete the regulatory framework.  It has established a tariff regime, prescribed standards and\nprocedures  to  determine  and  revise  tariffs,  issued  application  and  modification  procedure\nregulations,  and  issued  procedures  for  the  application  of  service  licenses.    NEPRA  is\nresponsible  for  issuing  licenses,  franchising  monopoly  business,  setting  and  enforcing\nperformance  standards  and  codes  of  practices,  enforcing  competitive  policies,  and  setting\ncharges for the monopoly parts of the industry.  It will also impose special levies and license\nfees, in line with the prevailing regulations.  NEPRA, under the Act, is mandated to protect the\nconsumers against monopolistic prices, encourage efficiency in licensee operations through\nfinancial incentives, encourage economic efficiency by promoting competition, and eliminate\ncross-subsidies between regions and consumer groups.  The Act includes the legal framework\nfor establishing of a competitive electricity market, where generation companies can negotiate\nthe price of electricity with willing customers. The Act also includes the establishment of a\nsystem operator and a power exchange with the responsibility to maintain a secure and reliable\nbulk power supply. ADB provided TA5 to assist NEPRA in strengthening its capabilities.\n3. Financial Restructuring and Privatization of KESC\n60. Restructuring.  In November 1998, the Government approved a financial package of\nabout PRs33.00 billion ($638 million) to cover KESC\u2019s cumulative cash shortfalls for FY1996 to\nFY1998.  This amount was included in the IMF\u2019s ESAF.  KESC\u2019s financial restructuring plan\naimed to restore its positive net worth, which eroded over time with sustained losses, and improve\nits liquidity position. The comprehensive restructuring package allowed KESC to wipe out all the\ncumulative cash shortfalls up to June 1998.  However, KESC failed to achieve the targeted level\nof account receivables and T&D losses, and theft continued to increase at an alarming rate.\nCoupled with the adverse impact of the fuel price surge, KESC has continued to incur cash\nshortfalls since June 1999, and its negative net worth is growing.   KESC\u2019s financial condition is\nextremely serious.  KESC will continue to incur cash shortfalls during the coming years.  The\ncumulative KESC funding shortfall, under the base scenario, for June 2000 to June 2003 is\nprojected at PRs61.9 billion ($1.2 billion, excluding financing charges). The Government has\nguaranteed the provision of KESC\u2019s cumulative cash shortfalls of PRs61.9 billion, to keep it afloat,\nat least until it is privatized, which is expected by December 2002, with financial close in June\n2003. Details are in Appendix 7. To keep KESC solvent until it is privatized, additional financial\n                                                \n5 TA 3409-PAK: Capacity Building of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, for $1,000,000, approved on\n3 June 2000.", "18\nrestructuring, as recommended by the privatization adviser,  will be necessary and will have to\ninclude conversion of KESC\u2019s debt service liability to the Government into equity and refinancing\nthe term finance certificates by bonds with longer maturity.\n61. Privatization. The Government has been involved, since February 1996,  in privatizing\nKESC by selling 51.0 percent of KESC\u2019s share capital and turning management control over to\na strategic private investor.  To oversee the process, the Government constituted a panel\ncomprising the representatives of the Privatization Commission, ministries of finance, water, and\npower; and KESC.  The Government used the services of two financial advisers for KESC\nprivatization.  The work done by the first financial adviser broadly covered privatization and\nsales  strategy;  business  and  operational  issues  of  KESC;  and  recommendations  for  the\nrestructuring and related action plans.  These activities were taken over by a second financial\nadviser who was appointed to complete the process of KESC privatization by December 1998.\nHowever,  the  country  faced  an  unprecedented  financial  and  economic  crisis,  and  the\nprivatization  was  further  delayed.  Consequently,  the  agreement  with  the  second  financial\nadviser was terminated in December 1999.  As a result, a new privatization adviser is required\nto privatize KESC.\n62. The decision to privatize KESC has been postponed since 1996, due to frequent change\nof governments and the vested interest of the people in power, and the IPP controversy. The\ncommitment  of  the  present  Government  to  privatize  KESC  is  considered  by  the  funding\nagencies to be irreversible due to several factors.  The most important factor, is that the\nGovernment recognizes that it cannot afford to continue to support KESC (para. 60) as such\nsupport  has  destroyed  Pakistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  framework  and  threatens  it\u2019s  financial\nsolvency.  Thus, the Government decided that KESC must be privatized quickly.  Based on this\ndecision, the Privatization Commission provided ADB with the Government\u2019s time frame for\nsteps leading to the privatization of KESC.  The ADB Program will support the privatization of\nKESC,  and  help  ensure  that  the  process  of  bidding,  evaluating,  and  selecting  a  strategic\ninvestor is transparent and undertaken on a competitive basis.  The Government is committed\nto comply with these ADB requirements.\n63. In  support  of  its  privatization  program  in  August  2000,  the  GOP  approved  the\nprivatization law to give legal cover to the privatization process.  The law mandates that 90.0\npercent of the sale proceeds are to be used for debt retirement and 10.0 percent for poverty\nalleviation.  The privatization law covers the process of transactions and protects the rights of\nthe buyers and consumers.  To secure the interest and confidence of the private investors, the\nlaw stipulates that a Government agency may not investigate any transactions one year after\nthe completion of the transaction.  Furthermore, the Government has formulated the draft labor\npolicy  guidelines  in  consultation  with  employees  and  employers,  organizations,  and  the\nprovincial governments.  These guidelines are being used to develop a new labor policy, which\nwill protect the rights of workers and employers.  Furthermore, the Government has announced\na detailed list of public sector enterprises, including KESC,  that must be privatized.  The\ndecision to privatize the public assets is also in response to requirements of IMF\u2019s SAL, and the\nPRGF, which mandates the Government to retire the country\u2019s debt out of the sale proceeds.\nTo create a favorable environment and to rebuild the confidence of the private sector to invest in\nthe power sector, the Government has resolved the IPP issue by signing an orderly framework\nsatisfactory  to  all  concerned,  and  is  finalizing  the  outstanding  cases  against  HUBCO  and\nKAPCO. To build further confidence among strategic investors, the Government has established\nNEPRA, an independent sector regulator, to ensure that the interests of the consumers and the\ninvestors are protected, and that the sector moves toward a competitive environment.", "19\n64. At the request of the Government, ADB provided a TA for the privatization of KESC.6\nThe TA will engage the services of an internationally renowned and experienced privatization\nadviser to complete the process of KESC privatization. The privatization adviser will be required\nto  engage  and  mobilize  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  experts  (consortium)  from  its  own\norganization or from outside sources as necessary, with skills and experience in restructuring\nand privatizing utilities, financial restructuring, electric utility operations and management, labor\nissues and human resource planning, legal review and analysis, and technical and financial due\ndiligence.  The privatization adviser will formulate a labor restructuring plan in preparation for\nprivatizing KESC and will provide an analysis of options and costs for the labor strategy for\ndiscussion and finalization by the Government and ADB\u2019s review.  A federal steering committee\nat Islamabad and a KESC privatization cell at Karachi have been established to coordinate and\nexpedite the process of KESC privatization.  To accelerate the process, the Government has\nprovided $1.0 million cash to match ADB\u2019s budget allocation of $1.0 million for the TA costs, and\nagreed that its share of $1.0 million could be disbursed first for payments of the privatization\nadviser\u2019s services.\n65. ADB is encouraging the Government to consider proposals to sell further equity stakes\nfrom its remaining 42.0 percent share in KESC, since sales will help build up the market\u2019s and\nthe strategic investor\u2019s confidence and facilitate the overall privatization process in Pakistan.\n4. Restructuring of WAPDA and Privatization of Corporatized Entities\n66. Financial Restructuring.  To help improve WAPDA\u2019s liquidity, the Program requires (i)\nthe Government, provincial governments, and private consumers to reconcile all billing disputes\nwith WAPDA, and pay in cash the amounts past due to WAPDA; (ii) WAPDA to implement\nmeasures to ensure timely payment of bills from government departments and agencies; and\n(iii) WAPDA to reduce its payables to normal commercial levels. WAPDA\u2019s theft and loss\nreduction program is outlined in Appendix 6.  To restore WAPDA\u2019s financial viability,  the\nGovernment  converted  into  equity  WAPDA\u2019s  pending  debt  service  liability,  amounting  to\nPRs36.3 billion in FY2000.\n67. Unbundling of WAPDA. Under the restructuring program, WAPDA has already been\nunbundled, i.e., the Power Wing and all its operational departments has been detached from\nWAPDA. Thus, WAPDA is left with the Water Wing for water resources management, including\nhydro  generation.  Supplementary  Appendix  G  shows  the  organizational  structure  of  the\nunbundled WAPDA. The WAPDA Act was amended in December 1998, which allowed the\nestablishment of the Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO) for unbundling of WAPDA into\n(i) 8 distribution companies (DISCOs), formed from existing area electricity boards, and 3\nthermal generation companies (GENCOs), of WAPDA\u2019s 11 thermal generation plants; and (ii)\nthe National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC), out of the National Grid Company\nwhich will operate the transmission system and control dispatch.  Under the amended act, the\nunbundled entities, including the National Grid Company, have been corporatized; consumer\ncontracts have been transferred from WAPDA to the corporatized distribution companies; staff\nof the Power Wing have been transferred to the corporatized entities, and WAPDA shares in\ncorporatized entities have been transferred to the President of Pakistan.  The restructuring of\nthe Power Wing of WAPDA into separate corporations is essential and advantageous since it\nwill establish distinct asset blocks to be operated autonomously, and enable a shift to business\norientation with the introduction of commercial practices. The primary focus of each corporate\n                                                \n6 TA 3502-PAK: Support for Privatization of Karachi Electric Supply Corporation for $1,000,000, approved on\n22 September 2000.", "20\nentity will be customer satisfaction and profit. Under the competitive set-up of the restructured\npower sector through the Program, there will be no room for the social subsidies that are\ncurrently a part of, and are hidden in, the unified accounts of WAPDA. The subsidies being\nprovided by the Government through the revenues of WAPDA will be identified, quantified, and\ntransparent,  for  the  Government  to  pay  for  the  services  rendered  by  the  independent\ncorporatized entities.\n68. Thus, the unbundled Power Wing will lead to a structure with several private GENCOs\noperating under free market conditions, several private regulated DISCOs providing reliable\nelectricity to consumers at a price fixed by NEPRA, and a regulated NTDC.\n69. Corporatization and Commercialization Program.  As a first step, eight DISCOs,\nthree GENCOs, and the NTDC have been registered. To complete the corporatization process,\nthe following are being completed: (i) transfer of assets and liabilities, (ii) transfer of personnel,\n(iii) financial restructuring and provision of working capital, and (iv) execution of all legal and\ncontractual agreements.  These actions will allow the new companies to begin to function and\ncarry out autonomously the business activities with independent board of directors, financial\nstatements, legal and regulatory legitimization. Thus, the financial modeling and restructuring,\nasset allocation and evaluation, transfer pricing, and execution of all legal documents and\ncontracts will be effected simultaneously. These activities are under way, and their finalization\nand consistency with the overall restructuring program will be closely monitored. The new\ncompanies are designing and implementing the manpower transition program, management\ninformation systems, and change management initiatives.  A group of management consultants\nis assisting them with all activities related to the restructuring of WAPDA\u2019s unbundled entities.\n70. Privatization of WAPDA\u2019s Corporatized Entities. PEPCO is also mandated to sell the\ncorporatized units. Under the reform Program, at least one DISCO and one GENCO will be\nprivatized under the ADB program of assistance.  To facilitate the timely sale of the two entities,\nthe Government has amended the WAPDA Act to allow the transfer of WAPDA shares in the\ncorporatized entities to the President of Pakistan, and authorized the voting rights  in the\ncorporatized entities to the Chairman of PEPCO.  The amended Act authorized the transfer of\nconsumer contracts from WAPDA to the distribution companies.  In addition, the World Bank\nalso stipulates a number of DISCOs to be taken to the market for sale.  After the completion of\nthe sales, PEPCO will be dismantled and will cease to exist.\n5. Enabling a Competitive Electricity Market\n71. The transformation of the power sector into a privatized electricity market in Pakistan will\nbe an evolutionary process that may take many years. The precise form and timing of the\nevolution cannot be predicted at this stage because it will depend on many intervening policy\ndecisions and external factors. The power sector will go through a period of transition which will\nlead to a competitive market. The transition period will involve unbundling, corporatization, and\ncommercialization of 12 entities; privatization of KESC; and the sale of at least one DISCO and\none GENCO. The transition period will set the groundwork for future actions; its implementation\nwill be the most critical element of the Program as it will set the foundation for the market-based\nprinciples. During this period, appropriate action will be taken to resolve major issues covering\ntariff subsidies, and a mechanism determined to establish transfer prices from generation to\ntransmission and from transmission to distribution.\n72. During the transition period, NEPRA will regulate aspects of the electric power sector\nthat  remain  a  natural  monopoly,  will  foster  the  competitive  structure,  and  will  ensure  the", "21\nreliability and adequate supply of electric power. NEPRA will ensure that the interests of the\ninvestor and the customer are balanced through judicious decisions based on transparent\ncommercial principles and prudent investments so that the sector moves toward a competitive\nenvironment. NEPRA will minimize the burdens of regulation, in terms of both the scope of\nregulatory  activity  and  interference  with  the  management  of  the  regulated  entities.  As  the\nindustry becomes fully competitive, the need for regulation will diminish.\n73. At present, a nationally uniform tariff structure is applied by WAPDA and KESC with a\nlarge  degree  of  cross-subsidization.    The  cross-subsidies  will  be  phased  out  during  the\ntransition  period.  The  Government  will  fund  socially  desired  services  directly  under  a\ntransparent system, whereas the lifeline tariff for poor households will be cross-subsidized by\nthe sector itself. With the phased removal of most of the tariff subsidies, rate differentials will\nemerge across the country reflecting the variable cost in providing the power services. One of\nthe  most  critical  issues  during  the  transitional  phase  relates  to  the  human  resources\nrationalization plan. While a part of the labor force will be retained in the restructured power\nsector, a large complement may be retrenched. The retrenchment will be subject to existing\nrules and regulations and compensation under a transparent system.\n74. It is envisaged that the restructured power sector may go through two distinct phases\nduring transition to a competitive electricity market.  As the restructured sector matures and\nproducers,  distributors,  and  regulators  gain  experience,  the  system  should  shift  to  a  fully\ncompetitive model by removing the bulk supply tariff, and allowing multiple buyer and seller\nagreements. As the market develops further, retail companies may enter the market to trade\nand provide services to customers.  The two phases leading to a competitive electricity market\nare outlined below.\n75. Phase 1.  In Phase 1, the system will be the \u201csingle buyer\u201d type, i.e., all energy will be\nbought by NTDC from GENCOs, WAPDA (Water Wing), and IPPs and sold to the DISCOs. The\nconsumers will have no choice of DISCOs as the DISCOs will be restricted to supply power\nwithin their respective franchise areas. During this phase, transfer pricing from the GENCOs to\nNTDC, from NTDC to the DISCOs and the retail price to consumers, will be set by NEPRA. It is\nexpected that annual transfer prices and tariffs will be adjusted over time, according to a pre-\ndetermined formulae, to promote efficiency in each corporation.\n76. Until generation and distribution have become fully competitive, the NTDC will stay as a\npublic sector company.  The NTDC will not own any generation or distribution assets.  The\nNTDC, being a natural monopoly, will be closely regulated by NEPRA, and will operate as the\n\"single buyer\" of power from all GENCOs.  It will ensure economic dispatch; the integrated,\nstable and safe operation of the electric power system\u2019s future load and system planning and\nforecasting;  and  the  wholesale  electricity  market.    It  will  be  responsible  for  forecasting\ngeneration requirements by utilizing information provided by the distribution companies, the\ngovernment planners and NEPRA.  The NTDC will also ensure that the requisite investments\nare made in the transmission network to meet the national needs.  Although under PEPCO, the\nNTDC  will  have  full  financial,  administrative,  and  operational  autonomy  to  ensure  that  its\ndecisions do not discriminate between players in the market and are based on purely economic\nand commercial principles under the regulatory oversight of NEPRA.  The Phase 1 model is\nlikely to be in place in 5-7 years.\n77. Phase 2.  In Phase 2, the system will be of a \u201cmultiple buyer and seller\u201d type, i.e., the\nDISCOs will have a choice to buy electricity from any GENCO and use the services of the\nNTDC for a fee (wheeling charge) to carry the electricity to their respective franchise areas. The", "22\nDISCOs could also buy electricity from the wholesale market provided by the NTDC. The new\nIPPs will have no PPA with the GOP, instead they will enter into contracts either with the\nDISCOs or the NTDC or both. The larger industrial consumers of over 1 MW will be able to\nchoose from which DISCOs to purchase electricity. They will also be able to contract directly\nwith the GENCOs.\n78. During this phase, a new market, known as the pool, will be established for trading\nelectricity between generators and suppliers. The pool will not itself buy or sell electricity, but it\nwill be constituted by agreements between those participating in it. Sales and purchases of\nelectricity  in  this  market  will  be  made  between  the  participating  generators  and  suppliers\naccording to a set of pool rules which will govern the market\u2019s operation and the calculation of\npayments due to and from each of them. Because pool prices will fluctuate, generators and\nsuppliers may enter into bilateral agreements known as Contracts for Differences (CFDs) to\nprovide a degree of protection against such fluctuations. CFDs will be used to fix the prices that\nthe supplier pays and the generator receives for electricity traded through the pool. The Phase 2\nmodel should be in place for at least 5-7 years.  Thereafter, the supply brokers may enter into\nthe electricity market who will buy electricity, package it and sell it to the consumers, using the\ngrid of the NTDC and the distribution network of the DISCOs. The DISCOs will no longer have a\nmonopoly  of  the  supply  of  electricity  to  their  respective  franchise  areas.  The  consumers,\nincluding the individual households, will be given a choice of which supplier they will buy from.\nHowever, the DISCOs will retain the ownership of their respective distribution networks. It is\nenvisaged that most of the DISCOs\u2019 profits will be from rental of their distribution networks to the\nsuppliers.\n79. The role of NEPRA will be drastically reduced as the competitive structure is in place.\n6. Resolving the IPP, HUBCO and KAPCO Issues\n80. The Government has implemented an orderly framework for resolving the IPP issue. Of\nthe 19 IPPs, memoranda of understanding entailing revision in tariffs have been concluded with\n13 IPPs, 3 IPPs are operating under the original power purchase agreements (PPAs), 1 IPP\nwas cancelled, and 2 others have opted out. The settlement processes for HUBCO and KAPCO\nare in progress, and the Government is committed for adequate implementation of an orderly\nprocess to resolve the commercial dispute with HUBCO and address the dispute with KAPCO.\nThe resolution of the IPP issue has built some confidence in the market and generated interest\nfrom a few strategic investors for the purchase of KESC and WAPDA\u2019s two corporate entities.\n7. Enhancing Reform in Natural Gas and Petroleum\n81. The  Government  policy  is  to  deregulate  the  subsector  and  introduce  market-based\npolicies and pricing mechanisms.  The Government plans to reduce/eliminate its ownership\nholdings in the petroleum subsector, establish a petroleum regulatory authority, and restructure\nthe  natural  gas  subsector.    These  reforms  are  expected  to  build  investor  confidence  and\naccelerate private sector capital flow in the subsectors.  The Government\u2019s role will be limited to\naddressing the issues and formulating appropriate policy framework.  The Government policy\naims at bringing the country\u2019s dependence on energy imports within manageable proportions by\nmobilizing,  to  the  greatest  possible  extent,  all  domestic  energy  resources;  increasing  fuel\nsubstitutions in the industrial sector; increasing efficiency in energy use; and implementing\nenergy conservation programs.", "23\n82. The Government has formulated a strategic plan for the restructuring and privatizing the\nnatural gas and petroleum subsectors.  Under this policy initiative, SSGC and SNGPL will be\nunbundled, corporatized, and eventually privatized.  In addition, the Government plans to divest\nits ownership in companies involved in the upstream oil and gas activities, the downstream oil\nmarketing firms such as Pakistan State Oil, and other shareholdings in the petroleum sector.  In\nthis regard, the Government extended greater autonomy to the state-owned enterprises (SOEs)\nin  the petroleum sector to prepare the entities for their privatization. The SOEs have been\nencouraged to seek private sector investment along with management expertise, including\nnomination of private sector representations on the boards of the entities.  These efforts will\nimprove the overall performance of the SOEs and increase their market value prior to the\nplanned privatization.  The Government will announce a new policy outlining the activities,\nincluding its economic and social objectives in the natural gas and petroleum subsectors.\n83. To provide a legal and regulatory framework for the reform program in the natural gas\nand petroleum subsectors, the Government established the Petroleum Regulatory Board for the\noversight  of  the  subsectors.    Furthermore,  the  Government  has  deregulated  the  prices  of\nfurnace oil and introduced quarterly price adjustments that are linked to the international price\nfluctuations.  In addition, the Government will deregulate the impact of diesel phase-out during\nthe program period.  To enhance the reform Program in the subsectors, the Government has\nrationalized the freight pool arrangements for furnace oil and will establish, during the program\nperiod, a phase-out program for the diesel freight pool.\n84. The reform Program in the energy sector will be supported jointly by ADB, World Bank,\nand IMF, but with well-defined and specific program elements for each institution to ensure that\nsectorwide issues are addressed and the leverage of the institutions is mutually reinforced.\nBecause of the long association with the two utilities, ADB\u2019s assistance under the ESRP covers\nboth KESC and WAPDA, whereas the World Bank will assist only WAPDA. The policy matrix of\nthe reform Program is a joint effort with clear delineation of the division of labor. ADB, World\nBank, and IMF will monitor implementation of the reform program.\nD. Social and Environmental Issues\n  1. Social Issues\n85. The ESRP will result in a reduction of the burden on the fiscal deficit and in considerable\noverall efficiency gains for the economy. As a result it will have positive impacts on economic\ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction.  This  will  benefit  the  population  in  Pakistan  as  a  whole.\nAnticipated short-term transitional adverse impacts include labor retrenchment and the effects of\ntariff increases on nonpoor residential and commercial consumers. The direct and indirect\nimpacts on poor households are expected to be positive.  In the long run, the competitive\nelectricity market will result in efficiency gains, lower cost of bulk power, and greater reliability of\nsupply,  which  will  be  captured  by  consumers  at  large.  In  the  short  term,  tariff  increases,\nreflecting cost recovery, may be considered to restore financial health. However, in the longer\nterm, as a result of efficiency gains from competition, increases will be smaller than would be\nnecessary  without  the  restructuring  Program.  The  expected  impacts  of  the  Program  are\nsummarized in Appendix 8 table A8.2.\n86. Impact on Labor.  The program will support the Government\u2019s labor policy \u201cto prevent\ndistress  from  short-term  interruptions  in  income  streams.\u201d  The  privatization  adviser  to  be\nengaged under the ADB TA grant, will determine the extent of labor restructuring for KESC\nbased on a financial evaluation. The impact on retrenched labor will be addressed and mitigated", "24\nby a number of initiatives under the labor impact assessment (LIA). Various options will be\nconsidered in consultation with all stakeholders. These may include (i) phasing out excess labor\nthrough  natural  attrition,  (ii)  retraining  for  redeployment  within  KESC  transmission  and\ndistribution departments, (iii) voluntary lay-offs with compensation, (iii) retraining for small-scale\nbusiness and other sectors of the labor market, and (iv) early retirement with full benefits. As\nlabor costs represent a small component of the utility\u2019s total costs, and rather than risk a\npossible conflict with labor representatives, phasing out by natural attrition and retraining are\nlikely  options.    For  each  new  corporate  entity  of  WAPDA,  PEPCO  is  preparing  a  human\nresources transition program.  The program is designed to absorb as many staff as possible\nwith training and through redeployment in the expanded transmission and distribution network\nsystem.  Labor retrenchment will be identified together with appropriate compensation packages\nfor implementation when each corporation is privatized.  The Government has agreed that the\ncosts  of  the  human  resources  transition  programs  will  be  estimated  and  sufficient  funds\nallocated for their implementation.\n2.  Environmental Issues\n87. The ESRP will have no direct environmental impacts, but in the longer term indirect\nimpacts should be beneficial due to lower losses and demand-side measures adopted. The\neffect of changes in the tariff structure, which will reduce subsidies to agricultural and domestic\ncustomers, will send the correct signals about the real cost of energy to consumers and lead to\na reduction in wastage of energy. This will restrain load growth with consequent environmental\nbenefits.\nE. Cost of Adjustment of the Restructuring Program\n88. While it is not possible to precisely determine the cost of the comprehensive ESRP, it\ncan be broadly estimated at $1.705 billion (Table).\nTable.

Restructuring Cost\n89. The  restructuring  cost  of  the  ESRP  (item  8  in  the  table),  prior  to  privatization,  is\nestimated by the Government at $1.555 billion, of which, about $762 million has been incurred\nby the Government, and $493 million will be incurred by June 2003, when KESC and two units\nof WAPDA are privatized, which is expected by December 2002. An important part of the\nprogram\u2019s restructuring cost includes the cost to help address the circular debt problem in the\npower  sector,  which  is  threatening  to  bankrupt  the  utilities  and  their  fuel  suppliers  and\ncontractors, and endangering Pakistan\u2019s financial solvency. Appendix 7 shows the restructuring\ncost and the financing plan.\n90. The remaining $300 million of the restructuring cost relates to the adjustment cost of the\nnatural gas and petroleum subsectors, of which the Government has already financed about\n$100 million. In light of the difficult external environment and social and economic problems the\ncountry is facing,  the Government, under the ADB reform Program, has already instituted policy\nreforms in the natural gas and petroleum subsectors, and is committed to implement further\nmeasures during the program period. The Government\u2019s reforms in the natural gas and the\npetroleum  subsectors  are  already  creating  a  favorable  climate  for  the  private  sector\ninvestments, which are expected to increase the availability of natural gas for use in the power\nplants currently using imported furnace oil.  As a result of the reforms, the new private sector\ninvestments are expected to make an additional 600 million cubic feet per day of natural gas\navailable in Pakistan during the next 30 months, for use in the power plants.  The use of the\nnatural gas as a fuel for thermal power generation by the IPPs and other private sector investors\nwill save Pakistan about $3.0 billion in foreign exchange over the next 10 years, or about $300\nmillion annually ($120 million from KESC\u2019s operations alone), thereby reducing substantially the\ncurrent account deficit.\n2.  Operating Costs and Other Related Costs of Reform\n91. Associated costs of the ESRP, and of setting up NEPRA,  consumer advocacy groups,\nand the privatization commission that are required under the ESRP; the cost of the restructuring\nplans for WAPDA, KESC, and the natural gas and petroleum subsectors; and the expected\ncosts  of  privatization  of  energy  sector  utilities  are  estimated  at  about  $39.5  million.    The\nGovernment has already financed about $23.7 million (about 60.0 percent) of these costs.\n3.  Labor Restructuring\n92. The  power  sector  currently  employs  about  122,300  people.    While  the  level  of\noverstaffing is currently being reviewed (by the privatization advisers for KESC and PEPCO for\nWAPDA), the overstaffing is assumed to be about 50.0 percent. Initially, about 12,000 workers\nmay be retrenched from KESC and WAPDA during the program period.  Using the historic\naverage cost of retrenchment compensation paid in Pakistan of $4,650 per worker, plus a\nstandard gratuity of $2,350 representing 0.5 months per year of service, the estimated cost of\nlabor retrenchment, including a 10 .0 contingency, is about $98 million.  Such costs will have to\nbe borne by the Government, either as outright payments to retrenched employees or reflected\nas part of the effective sale price to private buyers.\n93. The Government has agreed to make additional funds available for extra cash payments\nabove the statutory minimums for various groups of laid-off workers, to prevent them and their\ndependents from becoming impoverished.  The Government is undertaking an actuarial study to", "26\ndetermine its pension liabilities to the employees of WAPDA, who will be retained in the privatized\nentities, to ensure that the funds are available to meet all its future obligations.\n4.  Skills Development Program\n94. The Government will engage consultants to advise the retrenched workers and their\nfamilies  on  how  to  manage  the  cash  compensation  received  under  the  retrenchment  plan,\nincluding the setting up of small businesses.  This may also require provision of financial services\nand other professional advice on entrepreneur development and training.  The Government will\nalso  team  experienced  in  developing  and  implementing  redeployment  packages,  including\ncounseling  services,  consultation  with  stakeholders,  retraining  programs,  outplacement,  and\nformulation  of  special  measures  to  vulnerable  groups.    The  retrenchment  plan  will  include\nassistance for implementing the program through the provision of trainers and advisers and to\nmonitor the effectiveness of the plan.  The cost of the skills development program is estimated at\n$12.5 million.\nVI.     THE PROPOSED LOANS\nA. Amount of Loans and Source of Funds\n95. Loans  totaling  $350  million,  comprising  $300  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources (OCR) and $50 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be used to support\nthe Government\u2019s reform program for the ESRP. The Government will use the counterpart funds\nfrom the Special Funds resources loan to meet the labor retrenchment costs for KESC and\nWAPDA, and the skills development program under the ESRP (paras. 92-94)  The loan size for\nthe ESRP has been determined on the basis of immediate financing requirements, the costs of\nimplementing the ESRP\u2019s structural reforms, including the social costs, strategic significance of\nthe power sector, and current financial position of the Government. The cost of the ESRP is\nestimated at $1.705 billion.\n96. Parallel financing by the World Bank of $300 million is expected, for banking, energy,\nand public sector reform programs, under their SAL, which is in line with immediate sector\nadjustment requirements and the external financing gap of Pakistan. Assistance to the energy\nsector under SAL covers7  WAPDA\u2019s unbundling into twelve units, corporatization of unbundled\nunits, and privatization of a few of these units.  ADB\u2019s ESRP and the World Bank\u2019s SAL are\nintegral elements of the IMF\u2019s current standby adjustment loan and the subsequent Poverty\nReduction Growth Facility (PRGF) in Pakistan.\nB. Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n97. The Borrower will be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.  The OCR loan will carry an\ninterest rate to be determined in accordance with the ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate\nsystem for US dollar loans with a maturity of 15 years, including a 3 year grace period, a front-\nend fee of 1.0 percent, and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum.  The Special\nFunds resources loan will be provided in various currencies for a term of 24 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace\nperiod, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The loans will be utilized over a three-year period\nfrom the date of loan effectiveness.\n                                                \n7 In addition to SAL, the World Bank is in the process of formulating a Power Sector Adjustment Loan (PSAL).", "27\n98. The loans will be linked to timely implementation of the actions identified in the policy\nmatrix and will be released in three tranches.  The Government has already incurred about $786\nmillion in adjustment costs relating to the reforms in place.  The first tranche of $150 million will\nbe made available in December 2000, following compliance with the conditions identified in the\npolicy matrix and upon loan effectiveness.  The first tranche represents only about 25.0 percent\nof the cost already incurred by the Government.  The balance of the adjustment cost, amounting\nto about $919 million, will be spent by the Government during the remaining period of the\nProgram.  An incentive tranche of $50 million, from OCR, will be made available after three\nmonths and upon satisfactory compliance with the stipulated conditions.  The second tranche of\n$75 million is expected to be released in December 2001, but this will be depend on the\nprivatization of WAPDA\u2019s two units.  The third tranche, also $75 million, will be disbursed in\nDecember 2002, when the condition relating to the privatization of KESC is met.  Specific\nconditionalities are set for the release of the second and the third tranches; however, if all\nconditions for the second tranche are met, except the privatization of the two WAPDA entities\n(one DISCO and one GENCO), and the third tranche condition for the privatization of KESC has\nbeen met, then the two privatization conditions will be transposed, and all conditions for the\nrelease of the second tranche will be considered to be met.\nC. Implementation Arrangements\n99. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency. It will coordinate and\nmonitor the overall implementation of the ESRP loan, and administer the use of the loan\nproceeds.  MOF  will  be  supported  by  (i)  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  (MWP)  in  the\nimplementation of the sector reforms, including operational improvements of the power utilities\nand the corporatization of WAPDA\u2019s power generation, transmission and distribution activities to\nbe managed by PEPCO, and restructuring of KESC and WAPDA; (ii) NEPRA on regulatory\nrequirements and tariff issues; and (iii) Privatization Commission on privatization of KESC and\ncorporatized WAPDA entities.\n100. A federal steering committee has been established to oversee the implementation of the\nESRP loan.  The committee, chaired by the secretary general (finance) and the chairperson of\nWAPDA and KESC; federal secretaries of MWP, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources,\nPrivatization Commission, and finance; managing directors of KESC; Privatization Adviser; and\nthe ADB\u2019s Resident Representative, Pakistan Resident Mission, will meet at least quarterly.\nThe committee will ensure that the reforms are undertaken in line with the agreed timetable.\nSimilarly, a KESC privatization cell at Karachi has been established to ensure the completion of\nKESC privatization at the agreed upon time.\nD. Procurement and Disbursements\n101. The proceeds of the loan will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items\nproduced in and from ADB member countries other than items specified in the prohibited items\nlist  (Appendix  9),  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The\nGovernment will certify that, during each year in which the proceeds of the program loan are\nexpected to be disbursed, the value of imports minus imports from ADB nonmember countries,\nineligible  items,  and  disbursements  made  under  other  official  development  assistance,  is\ngreater than the amount expected to be disbursed during the year.\n102. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy\nof  the  Government\u2019s  certification.  Disbursements  under  the  ESRP  loans  will  incorporate", "28\nsimplified  disbursement  procedures  and  audit  requirements.8  Withdrawals  will  be  allowed\nagainst eligible imports for which expenditures were incurred within 180 days prior to the loan\neffective date. Retroactive financing is justified to ensure timely release of counterpart funds to\nthe Government, which has already incurred a significant part of structural adjustment cost.\n103. All procurement under the ESRP loans will be undertaken through normal commercial\npractices  for  the  private  sector  or  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures\nacceptable to ADB, with due consideration given to economy and efficiency.\nE.  Counterpart Funding\n104. The counterpart funds generated out of the loan proceeds will be used to finance the\ncost of structural adjustment and programs and activities consistent with the ESRP. ADB will\nmonitor the use of counterpart funds during program implementation.\nF. Monitoring and Tranching\n105. All 20 items listed in the policy matrix, as conditions for loan negotiations have been\ncompleted. Similarly, 5 items listed for the release of the first tranche have also been completed.\nWhile the policy matrix also outlines a detailed list of operational monitorable milestones to be\ncompleted prior to the release of the second and third tranches, only four conditions stipulated\nwill be for the second tranche release and four for the third. ADB will continue to monitor the\ncompletion status through the progress reports of the federal steering committee, and the KESC\nprivatization cell.  If all conditions for the second tranche are met, except the privatization of the\ntwo WAPDA entities (one DISCO and one GENCO), and the third tranche condition in respect\nof  the  privatization  of  KESC  has  been  met,  then  the  two  privatization  conditions  will  be\ntransposed, and all conditions for the release of the second tranche will be considered to be\nmet.\n106. The Government and ADB will closely monitor the implementation and impact of the\nESRP loan. The Government will provide at least three reports (May 2002, November 2003, and\nMay 2004) to detail compliance with ESRP loan conditions and facilitate a final review of\ncompliance with the third tranche conditions of the ESRP loan. ADB will send review missions to\nexamine compliance with the conditions of the third tranche and advise on corrective action\nrequired to keep the ESRP implementation on course. The review missions will also review the\nproposed TA loan.\nVII.     THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN\n107. To support the energy sector reforms, the Government requested a TA loan for capacity\nenhancement in the energy sector to support the implementation of ESRP.  The TA loan funds\nwill also be used to establish a plan to mitigate the social impact of the ESRP.  ADB will assist\nKESC with a full Poverty Impact Assessment (PIA) during the program implementation to\nmonitor the effects of restructuring of KESC on poor consumers. The PIA will provide KESC\nwith tools for reducing theft and corruption, and enhancing consumer services.  The broad terms\nof reference are outlined in Appendix 10.\n108. During the Program period, ADB will assist with a full labor impact assessment (LIA) to\ndetermine, in advance of any layoffs, that adequate provisions are in place to safeguard the\n                                                \n8 R5-98: Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements of Program Loans, 23 March 1998.", "29\nlivelihoods of redundant workers and their families. The terms of reference for the consultants,\nwhich were formulated in consultation with all stakeholders, are presented in Appendix 10.  If\ninvoluntary layoffs are required, the Government may use a portion of the TA loan funds of $5.0\nmillion to assist in the preparation of a plan to reduce vulnerability of redundant workers in\nconsultation with all stakeholders. Such a plan will include cash payments above the statutory\nminimum for laid-off workers, provisions for retraining, and for training on the establishment and\nmanagement of small businesses. A team will be engaged with experience in developing and\nimplementing redeployment packages in a participatory framework. The mitigation measures\nwill include counseling services, pension/gratuity benefits, and retraining programs, specially\ndesigned to meet requirements of the labor market. If required, TA loan funds will be made\navailable to assist in the implementation and monitoring of the effectiveness of the retrenchment\nplan. ADB has agreed that the Government may use the proceeds of the ESRP loan to meet\nretrenchment costs for KESC and the privatized entities of WAPDA.\nVIII.     PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA. Impact on Poverty\n  1. Direct Impacts on the Poor\n109. About 75.0 percent of the Karachi population (about 120,000 connections) has electricity\nthrough legal connection. The estimated number of illegal connections is 400,000, consisting\nmainly of poor residential consumers.  Appendix 8 table A8.1 presents a dismal picture of\nunderbilling of wealthy consumers as being the main cause of KESC\u2019s poor financial state. The\naverage units billed for KESC consumers is well below the national average, although non-poor\nresidential and commercial consumer amount to nearly 80.0 percent of the KESC consumer\nbase.\n110. Given the lack of empirical data for electricity expenditure, the Mission conducted a\nhousehold survey in low-income areas of Karachi to assess the impacts on the poor. The\nfindings clearly show that corrupt practices and unreliable electricity supply has disproportionally\naffected  poor  consumers.  Although  non-poor  residential  and  commercial  consumers  are\naffected by power cuts resulting from deteriorating maintenance, these are more frequent and\npersist for longer time periods in low-income areas of Karachi. In addition, non-poor consumers\noften have generators to overcome the inconvenience of power cuts. Due to the high initial\ncapital costs, generators are not available for poor consumers. About 36.0 percent of the\nhouseholds interviewed lose a significant amount of income as a result of power cuts, and suffer\nadverse impacts on general household welfare, including lack of sleep, mosquito bites, security\nproblems, and loss of studying time.\n111. Poor consumers are especially susceptible to corrupt practices in collection, billing, and\nconnection fees. Poor residential consumers spend about 10.0 percent of income on electricity,\nwith large variations between consumers. This is well above international comparisons. For poor\nhouseholds, with a large share of expenditure on food, the corrupt practices have sometimes\nforced them to sell their assets and decrease expenditure on food. The vulnerability of poor\nconsumers is exacerbated because they (i) face difficulties monitoring their own electricity\nconsumption due to the irregularity of billing, lack of meter readings by KESC officials, and\ngeneral neglect in consumer services; and (ii) may be illiterate and unable to read their own\nmeter.  In addition, connection fees in low-income areas often had a 17.0 percent \u201cunofficial\u201d\nextra payment.", "30\n112. Corrupt  practices  have  taken  KESC  resources  away  from  the  provision  of  legal\nconnections. Although connection fees are a difficult hurdle for poor households to overcome,\nlegal connections are a high priority for poor households in squatter areas because they reduce\nvulnerability to extortion associated with the illegal connections, and a legal connection is\nperceived to strengthen property rights. Improvements in the billing system, meter readings, and\nconnection services are important tools for reducing vulnerability of poor consumers. However,\nto address the inefficiencies in the billing and distribution departments, initial capital costs are\nrequired. KESC is trapped in a vicious circle of low revenue collection and not being able to\ninvest in measures that would improve revenue collection. KESC as a public utility has not,\ndespite significant resources and efforts, been able to provide poor consumers with a fair share\nof benefits of the electricity sector.\n113. The key to addressing the vulnerability of poor consumers is to provide restore long-run\nfinancial  viability  of  the  electricity  sector  through  restructuring  and  privatization,  laying  the\nfoundation for a competitive and (thus) cost effective electricity market. Although KESC\u2019s acute\nfinancial situation will not primarily be solved by raising tariffs, but rather by reducing theft, tariff\nincreases reflecting cost recovery may be expected in the short run. With the elimination of\ncorrupt practices, strengthening of consumer groups, and lifeline tariffs, the expenditure on\nelectricity will have significant benefits for poor consumers.\n2. Indirect and Macroeconomic Impacts on the Poor\n114. The macroeconomic effects of the ESRP have wider implications for poverty than the\ndirect effects on the consumers. Although the key to reducing income poverty in Pakistan is\neconomic opportunities for the poor, it is not sufficient to reduce vulnerability and poverty in the\nlong run. Reliable electricity supply is crucial for industrial and commercial development to\nsecure  income-generating  activities.  A  stable  macroeconomic  environment  and  good\ngovernance are key variables for reducing risks and encouraging productive investments. Public\ninvestment in KESC nourish corruption and is a significant source of inefficient allocation of\nresources  in  the  economy.  It  diverts  public  funds  away  from  sectors  more  productive  for\neconomic growth and poverty reduction. For instance, the cash required to keep KESC afloat for\nFY2000 is nearly proportional to Government expenditure on social services and is more than\n1.7 times the expenditure on education or 5.0 times the expenditure on health. Although these\nfunds may not be fully fungible, the public allocation of funds to KESC is a costly and inefficient\nway to provide electricity and has implications for the budget deficit limiting the options available\nfor the Government. The KESC cash short-fall for FY2000 amounts to 5.2 percent of the fiscal\ndeficit and is projected to increase to 7.2 percent for FY2001. Given the overall fiscal deficit for\nPakistan (6.5 percent of GDP) the Government has limited resources to keep KESC afloat. The\nfiscal deficit can primarily be financed through increasing money supply or by domestic and\ninternational borrowing. Printing money causes inflation that acts as a tax, and the burden of\ninflation falls disproportionally on the poor. Borrowing crowds out private (and other public)\ninvestment, crucial for economic growth and employment generation. Privatization of KESC and\nrestoring financial health in the energy sector will reduce the burden on the Government deficit\nand induce a more efficient allocation of resources for the economy as a whole. Privatization of\nKESC is also strongly a governance issue that will act to reduce political and socioeconomic\nrisks.\nB. Program Benefits\n115. The ESRP\u2019s benefits are two-tiered. First, the ESRP is designed to reduce the role of the\nGovernment  in  the  management,  development,  and  operation  of  the  energy  sector.  The", "31\nprivatization of KESC, unbundling of WAPDA, and the creation of smaller corporate entities with\na view to privatizing them, will create an enabling environment for a competitive bulk electricity\nmarket. The electricity price will be based on commercial principles and consumers will benefit\nthrough improved service and reduced prices. Regulatory focus will shift from determining tariff\nlevels  to  ensuring  that  the  competitive  environment  is  maintained,  and  interventions  will\ngradually be limited to social and environmental areas. The Government will continue providing\npolicy directions for the sector in areas such as the use of domestic fuel, rural electrification, and\nsubsidies for poor consumers. Second, the macroeconomic position of Pakistan will improve as\na result of the restored financial viability of the power sector.\n116. Socioeconomic growth is also dependent on a swift improvement of the macroeconomic\nframework.  Economic  growth  is  crucial  to  ensure  job  opportunities  for  a  rapidly  growing\npopulation and to generate the financial resources for sustained investment in human and\nphysical capital in the private and public sectors. Once the financial health of the utilities has\nbeen restored, less Government subsidies will flow into the sector and a higher portion of capital\nexpenditures  for  system  expansion  can  be  generated  by  the  utilities,  also  reducing  the\nrequirement for Government support. This in turn will allow the Government to increase the\nallocation  of  its  scarce  resources  to  priority  programs  for  poverty  reduction  and  human\ndevelopment.\nC. Program Risks\n117. A continuous drainage from the fiscal budget to KESC will be a significant burden for the\neconomy.  It will deepen the budget deficit and divert public funds from more productive sectors\nin the economy with subsequent adverse impacts on poverty.  Continuous public investment in\nKESC nourishes corruption, adversely affecting the most vulnerable groups of consumers.  As a\nresult only two options are available for the Government: (i) provide no or limited electricity\nsupply in Karachi, or (ii) restructure and privatize KESC.  Given the industrial base in Karachi\nand the importance of electricity for industrial growth, the former option has severe implications\nfor investments, economic activity, and employment generation with subsequent effects for\neconomic growth and social unrest.  The effects of social unrest are publicly severe.  It will\ndestabilize an already fragile government, which in turn will delay the return to democracy.  A\nlack  of  light  on  the  streets  of  Karachi  would  have  severe  effects  on  security  and  safety,\nespecially for women, and would disproportionally affect the low-income areas of Karachi,\nwhere substitution possibilities are limited.  With dwindling investments in all sectors of the\neconomy, the prospects for economic recovery and poverty reduction would be dismal.\n118. While the risks involved in supporting a strong reform program in the power sector are\nsignificant, they are less than the risks of not supporting such a program. And, several factors\nmitigate the risks. Perhaps most important, the reform program is both comprehensive and\nGovernment formulated, and the plans for its implementation have been worked out by the\nGovernment with due attention to political realities and implementation capacity. A second\nmitigating factor is the sequencing of actions that are already in place, i.e., privatization of\nKESC; unbundling of WAPDA; and corporatization, commercialization, and completion of the\nprocess of the privatization of at least 4 out of 12 corporatized entities. A third mitigating factor is\nADB\u2019s intense monitoring of the implementation of the reform program along with World Bank\nand IMF. Finally, adequate provisions have been made to mitigate risks relating to social\naspects.\n119. The risks of not supporting the reform Program are greater than the risk of failure. The\nbenefits of the reforms to be implemented and the financial crisis that might eventuate in the", "32\nabsence of support for the bold actions already commenced by the Government strongly justify\nADB\u2019s involvement in and support for restructuring of the power sector.\nIX.     ASSURANCES\n120. In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following\nassurances which are incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i) The policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, as\ndescribed in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, will continue in\neffect for the duration of the Program Period.\n(ii)  Measures are being introduced to decrease the levels of theft and T&D losses at\nKESC and WAPDA.  These will be monitored frequently to ensure that losses are\nreduced and the financial status of the two utilities improved.\n(iii)  KESC and WAPDA\u2019s corporatized units will be privatized in a fair, transparent, and\ncompetitive manner and in the time frame agreed upon.\n(iv)  Labor retrenchment, as required, will be carried out in accordance with the laws of\nPakistan  and  the  Government  will  make  the  necessary  funds  available,  as\nrequired, for a voluntary retirement scheme in a timely manner.\n(v)  Public  awareness  campaigns  will  be  developed  under  the  TA  loan  and\nimplemented to gain broad-based public support for the reform program.\n(vi)  The Government will support  consumer advocacy groups through NEPRA and the\nTA loan, to make civil society aware of the operations of the energy sector.\n(vii)  The Government will maintain its policy to ensure a nonuniform tariff structure in\nthe country.\nX.

Sector Debt Situation\n1. The major elements of the debt situation as of June 2000 in the sector are shown in\nFigure A3.  Because both Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and Karachi\nElectric Supply Corporation (KESC) finance their capital investments mostly by a substantial\namount of loan credit from the Government, the net total debt of the sector to the governments\n(provincial and federal) amounts to about $2.425 billion (including $304 million of debt to state-\nowned  fuel  suppliers).  This  exceeds  the  Government\u2019s  proposed  national  development\nexpenditure budget for FY2000 of $1.940 billion, i.e., the debt of the sector is 1.25 times of the\nGovernment\u2019s development budget. The net indebtedness of WAPDA amounts to $1.4 billion\nincluding a contingent liability of $501 million owed to Hub Power Company (HUBCO) and Kot\nAddu Power Company (KAPCO). KESC carries $631 million of net debt. As WAPDA is almost\nsix times KESC in asset size, KESC is financially more burdened than WAPDA. Some debts are\ndisputed, particularly the arrears from the governments to WAPDA and KESC, because the two\nutilities in the past distributed inflated bills in order to enhance its cash flow. The amount\ninvolved, the circular nature of the debt, and the lack of trust between the parties have proved to\nbe formidable obstacles to resolution of the sector\u2019s financial difficulties. The Energy Sector\nRestructuring Program Loan, together with other lending to the sector, is designed to reconcile\nand restructure the various debts to provide a foundation for organizational restructuring.\nB.      Receivable Position of KESC and WAPDA\n2. To KESC, the government of Sindh and its local bodies owe almost PRs2 billion of\narrears, whereas the Federal Government paid out its arrears during FY2000 and is current on\nits payment. The Government has committed to have all public sector receivables outstanding\nas of 30 September 2000 paid before the incentive tranche release of the proposed loan. The\nPrivate  sector  accounts  for  83.0  percent  of  KESC\u2019s  arrears,  and  are  a  serious  problem.\nAlthough KESC has recently improved its current bill collection ratio from 64.0 percent in\nFY1998 to 75.0 percent in FY2000 with assistance from the army, collection from private\nconsumers leaves much to be desired. KESC has committed to reduce net receivable (net of\nprovision for bad debts) from 5.5 months of sales on June 2000 to 4.5 months by November\n2000  and  3  months  by  June  2003  through  remedial  measures,  including  additional  army\nassistance, rationalization of the billing process, outsourcing to Citibank the work of reconciling\nstatements, improved metering, and strict enforcement of disconnection policy.\n3. By  contrast,  for  WAPDA,  public  sector  arrears  have  reached  a  critical  level  while\ncollection from private customers continues to be good. The major public sector defaulters\ninclude AJ&K and the Government of Sindh, which owe 70.0 percent of WAPDA\u2019s public sector\narrears.  On 29 June 2000, the Government decided that arrears from federal and provincial\ngovernments, FATA, and agricultural tubewell consumers of Balochistan developed from 1\nJanuary  1999  to  30  June  2000  should  be  paid  immediately  while  the  arrears  of  Federal\nGovernment, FATA, and agricultural tubewell consumers developed prior to 1 January 1999\nshould be written off. All the payments regarding this decision have been made. However, a\nsettlement plan of arrears from the Government of Sindh developed prior to January 1999 is still\nbeing discussed.

Payable Position of KESC and WAPDA\n4. Because of accumulated arrears from consumers, KESC and WAPDA have delayed\ntheir payments to fuel suppliers, power suppliers, and lenders. While WAPDA is current on its\nfuel bills, KESC has not paid about PRs7 billion to its gas and oil suppliers, which are public\ncorporations such as Pakistan State Oil and National Refinery Limited. KESC has not paid its\npower purchase cost from WAPDA since March 1999.  KESC has also defaulted on its debt\nservice obligations to the Government amounting to PRs3.6 billion. Out of WAPDA\u2019s PRs29.4\nbillion payable to independent power producers, PRs26 billion represents deferred payment to\nHUBCO and KAPCO under court order. WAPDA\u2019s arrears to the federal Government were\nreduced substantially in FY2000 because PRs36.3 billion of its debt service liability to the\nGovernment was converted into equity.\nTable A3.2: Outstanding Balance of Accounts Payable\n(in PRs million)\nPayable KESC WAPDA\nTo 1999 2000a 1999 2000a\nOil & Gas 6,966        6,910       11,447        8,879\nPower Purchase 545        1,147       12,696      29,433\nFederal Government 770        3,650       37,015        3,349\nWAPDA 2,542        7,960          0 0\nOthers 0  0        4,124        4,095\n     Total 10,823       19,667       65,282      45,756\nKESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, WAPDA = Water and Power Development Authority.\na Provisional\nSource: KESC, WAPDA.", "Figure A3: Sector Debt Situation\n(as of June 2000, in $ million)\n2,060 Federal Government\n680a\n204 20\nProvincial Government\n357 38\nWAPDA 153 KESC\n5\n5\n171 133\n22\n567b\nState-Owned Fuel Suppliers\n483 299\nIndependent and other Power\nSuppliers\nPrivate Customer\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nTotal Debt Burden: About $5.2 Billion ix\n \n3\n,\na  Include foreign loans through the Government  p\na\nb  Includes contingent liability of $501 million to HUBCO and KAPCO g\ne\n \n3", "56\nAppendix 4\nTARIFF STRUCTURE AFTER MARCH 1999\n1.

The lifeline tariff of a 50 kWh consumption per month is PRs1.40/kWh. Higher rates apply\nto  households  using  more  than  50  kWh  per  month  and  range  from  PRs1.718/kWh  to\nPRs6.811/kWh with the average tariff at PRs3.89/kWh.  The residential customers consume\nabout  38  percent  of  the  total  consumption.  In  the  commercial  sector,  the  average  tariff  is\nPRs7.20/kWh.  The  commercial  consumption  accounts  for  about  9.0  percent  of  the  total\nconsumption. Industry tariffs are divided into four categories (Table A4). Industries consume about\n38.0  percent  of  the  total.  The  tariffs  for  the  bulk  supply  range  between  PRs4.57/kWh\u2013\nPRs4.82/kWh and represent 12.0 percent of the total consumption. Electricity used for street\nlighting (3.0 percent) is charged at PRs5.88/kWh.\n3. The electricity tariffs are comprised of four parts: (i) base tariffs, (ii) fuel adjustment\ncharges, (iii) surcharges, and (iv) additional surcharges. The base tariff is calculated on the\nrecovery of the fixed investment costs in generation, transmission, and distribution, in the form of\ndepreciation and interest plus operation and maintenance costs, including a portion of fuel cost\nand administrative overheads. Base tariffs are applicable to the fixed capacity charge and energy\nuse charge in industrial and bulk supply consumers, whereas only the energy use charge is\napplicable  to  residential,  commercial,  and  small  industrial  consumers.  The  fuel  adjustment\ncharges (FAC) were introduced in 1970 to recover the fuel cost in excess of PRs2.24 per million\nBritish thermal unit (BTU). However, after the introduction of a surcharge in January 1992, the fuel\nsubsidy was eliminated and the utilities were allowed to adjust the shortfall in fuel cost against\nrecovery  of  the  same.  The  surcharge  concept  in  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority\n(WAPDA) was introduced for payment of royalties to the provincial government at the rate of 2.5\npercent from 1 January 1992, and gradually increased to the level of 10.4 percent in 1997. The\nobjective of the additional surcharge was to generate sufficient revenues to meet the financial\ncovenants.", "LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLANNING\n(Pakistan Energy Sector Reforms)\nIntermediate Measures Achievements (1992-1998) Energy Sector Reform Targets (2003)\nADB      $2.1 bn\nLoans Investments Other Agencies      $7.4 bn\nPrivate Investment      $3.2 bn 1)   Mobilization of ADB resources              $700 m\nMobilization of WB resources                $700 m\nDemand Side Management Study 2)  No load shedding\nPolicies Support for the Government sector\nRestructuring 3)  No application for new connection pending for more\nthan 2 months\n4)  Collection to be at least 98% of billing\nPower and Water Institutional Study\nTechnical Institutions Management Information System Study\nAssistance KESC Organization and Restructuring Study 5)  Elimination of tariff cross-subsidy\nSplit of WAPDA Water and Power Wings\n6)  Work force optimized\n5\nHuman Resources 7)  Workers compensation package improved 7\nGeneration and Coordination Training\n8)  Network to increase peak load handling from\n10,000 MW to 15,000 MW\nGood Governance Private Hydro Policy Study\nEnactment of New Private Independent 9)  Losses reduced from 25% of input to the grid to\nPower Policy less than 15%\nInvestment in 6,500 MW of IPPs\n10)  Average thermal station fuel efficiency to be\nincreased to 35%\nCreation of National Sector Regulator\n11)  Commissioning of Ghazi Barotha and Chasma\nPrivate Sector (NEPRA) Hydropower projects\nUnbundling of WAPDA Power Wing\n12)  Implementation of new private independent power\npolicy\nEconomic and Regional Facilitation of Pakistan \u2013 India Power Trading\nSector Work Cooperation 13)  Average reliability increased to at least 95% at MV\nlevel\nKESC restructuring and privatization study\nTransition to Preparation for privatization of KESC\nMarket Economy Establishment of PEPCO A\np\np\ne\nn\nADB = Asian Development Bank, IPP = Independent Power Producer, KESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, MV  = megavolt, MW = megawatt, NEPRA = National Electric d\nPower Regulatory Authority, PEPCO = Pakistan Electric Power Company, WAPDA = Water and Power Development Authority, WB = World Bank. ix\n \n5", "58\nAppendix 6, page 1\nTHEFT AND LOSS REDUCTION PROGRAM OF KESC AND WAPDA\n1. A summary of measures instituted by Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC) and\nWater and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) to reduce theft and improve the overall\noperational and financial performance are outlined below.\nA.  KESC\n2. KESC has introduced the following measures:\n(i) Installation of ATMs.  KESC has entered into an agreement with Citibank to\ninstall on 1 October 2000 about 30 automated teller machines (ATMs), near KESC\npayment  stations.    The  ATMs  have  been  installed  and  eliminate  some  cash\npayments personnel, who often did not credit payments to the customer\u2019s account.\nThe ATM will increase the integrity of transactions, reduce fraud, provide cash to\nKESC, and decrease customers\u2019 complaints.  For its services, Citibank will receive\nfrom KESC PRs10 per transaction.\n(ii)  Citibank as KESC Collection Agency. Citibank entered into an agreement with\nKESC to become its collection agent.  The Citibank will accept payments from\nKESC customers at its branches.  The arrangement will increase the integrity of\nKESC\u2019s collection system, assist customers in the immediate accreditation of the\nbills  paid,  and  reduce  the  customers\u2019  burden  of  record  reconciliation.    The\narrangement has been in effect since 1 October 2000.\n(iii)  Citibank Data Management System.  Another Citibank agreement with KESC\ninvolves managing KESC\u2019s billing and payment system. Citibank will completely\nreconcile the amount billed by KESC\u2019s billing department and payments received\nat KESC\u2019s payment stations.  The outsourcing of this function is a major step in\navoiding  problems  relating  to  the  collection  of  cash.  The  Citibank  data\nmanagement control management system has been operational since 1 October\n2000, and will provide credibility to KESC\u2019s billing and collection system. Citibank\nwill receive from KESC PRs2.50 per reconciled payment stub.\n(iv) Substation Metering.  KESC will install meters at its substations to indicate the\nexact electricity usage in various areas of its franchise.  The meter reading will be\na cross check to the actual amount billed to the customers in each area, will\nprovide an accurate monitoring system, and will help ensure that the electricity\nconsumed from a particular substation is accurately billed and the correct amount\ncollected.    Initially,  the  meters  will  be  installed  in  areas  with  high  electricity\nconsumption.\n(v) Average Billing. The current billing system uses an average billing method to\nassess the monthly amount to be paid by the customers.  This practice has been\nan opportunity source of corruption. Effective 1 October 2000, KESC stopped its\ncurrent widespread practice of average billing.\n(vi)  Army Involvement.  KESC has recently employed 44 army personnel, mostly for\nintelligence gathering and for management positions.  In addition, 400 soldiers will\nbe  deployed  for  operational  activities  and  to  interact  with  KESC  customers.\nFurthermore, an additional 70 army personnel could be recruited as permanent", "59\nAppendix 6, page 2\nKESC staff at supervisory and management levels, to handle the operational and\nadministrative functions of KESC.  The involvement of the army is well planned\nand  coordinated,  and  indicates  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  restore  the\noperational and financial viability of KESC.\n(vii)  Extension of 11kV Lines into Interior of Residential and Commercial Areas.\nThis will delay the errant consumers the opportunity to install hooks on to lines\ndirectly.  Secondly, small capacity transformers and insulated low tension lines will\nbe used to run the system at rated capacity and reduce the possibility of illegal\nusage.\n(viii)  Metering Distribution Transformers.  KESC has initiated a program to install\nmeters on all distribution transformers.\n(ix)  Installation of Meters Outside the Premises.  Under this program, KESC has\nstarted to relocate the meters from inside the premises to outside to ensure proper\nconnection of service cable and meters.\n(x)  Use of Insulated Cables.  Using insulated 4-core bundled cables to avoid illegal\nconnections.\nB.  WAPDA\n3. Since mid-January 1999, WAPDA has been implementing, with the support of the armed\nforces, an intensive campaign to reduce electricity theft and losses, improve billing and collection,\nand improve its operational and financial performance. These efforts can be grouped in three\nbroad areas\u2013theft and loss reduction, improvements in operating systems and procedures, and\nbilling and collection (including the collection of arrears).\n4. The theft and loss reduction campaign is primarily focused on detection and removal of\nillegal electricity connections, and checking of consumer meters, and is implemented by the\ndistribution companies (DISCOs). On average 4,000-4,500 armed forces personnel are assigned\nto each DISCO, to support WAPDA personnel (organized into 15-20 teams of inspectors) in\ninspecting consumer premises, removing illegal connections, and lodging reports with the judicial\nauthorities in case there is evidence of electricity theft. In addition, a chief executive officer for\neach DISCO has been appointed from the army, for a period of two years.\n5. WAPDA reported that influential people (including ruling party politicians and other key\nofficials)  are  being  caught,  and  the  operation  appears  to  be  proceeding  without  political\ninterference. Since mid-January 1999, peak load has declined by 700-800 MW in the WAPDA\nsystem. The normal (daytime) load remained roughly constant, at about 4,400 MW. WAPDA\nofficials view this as an early indicator of the success of the theft reduction campaign, as illegal\nconnections are being removed by WAPDA and by consumers, in anticipation of the inspections.\n6. The results of this campaign are being documented and a comprehensive database on\nconsumers and load of each DISCO is being prepared.  This will enable WAPDA to more\nintensively monitor operational performance of each subdivision. Reports on electricity supplied,\nunits  billed,  and  revenues  collected  for  each  subdivision  are  being  submitted  to  WAPDA\nheadquarters, and are reviewed by senior WAPDA management on a weekly basis. Similarly, a\nsituation report is prepared daily on the activities being undertaken and is submitted to the chief\nexecutive officer of each DISCO.", "60\nAppendix 6, page 3\n7. The backlog of pending applications is being cleared quickly, and the process for providing\nnew connections has been streamlined. Since one of the main complaints regarding the provision\nof new connections related to the storage of meters available to the DISCOs, WAPDA has\nnegotiated  fixed  prices  for  meters  with  a  number  of  local  suppliers,  and  the  customer  can\npurchase the meter directly from those suppliers.\n8. The main focus of the campaign to detect illegal connections and theft is on domestic,\nindustrial, and commercial consumers. Checking the metering installations of these consumers\nrequires more technical knowledge and capital investment. While the detections are being made\nand consumer arrears calculated, it is not possible to verify whether the billing records (updated\nmeter reading, new meter number, etc.) are simultaneously being permanently updated. DISCOs\nare required to carefully check on this aspect, and ensure that the billing records are updated\nsimultaneously.", "61\nAppendix 7, page1\n CASH SHORTFALL FINANCING PLAN AND RESTRUCTURING COST\nA. KESC Cash Shortfall Projection\n1. The financial projections are driven by efficiency improvement measures committed by\nthe Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC)/the Government including: (i) change from\nfurnace oil to gas fuel, (ii) restoration of generation capacity (iii) reduction in transmission and\ndistribution (T&D) losses, and (iv) improvement in bill collection. No tariff increase is assumed in\nthe projection because further tariff increase can not be justified as the present KESC tariff level\nis considerably higher than the international level. However, if the National Electric Power\nRegulatory Authority (NEPRA) introduces a tariff setting mechanism to automatically reflect cost\nitems such as fuel increases, KESC\u2019s average tariff is likely to be raised.\n2. Change from Furnace Oil to Gas Fuel.  To take advantage of the lower cost of\ndomestic gas compared to imported furnace oil, KESC is converting Bin Qasim Thermal Power\nStation to a gas-fired Plant. The technical conversion of its four units has been completed, and\nthe remaining two units will be converted by January 2001. 176 million cubic feet/day of gas is\nrequired to operate all six units. However, due to the limited availability of gas, a full supply of\ngas is expected to start on January 2003. Until then, one unit will be operated under gas by\nJune 2001 and two units will be operative thereafter.\n3. Restoration of Generation Capacity.  An integrated phased program is in place to\nenhance KESC\u2019s generating capacity from 1,204 MW to 1,532 MW by May 2001. As KESC\u2019s\nown generation will increase, the resulting lower purchase of power, which is normally more\nexpensive than KESC\u2019s own generation, is expected to reduce overall generation cost.\n4. Reduction in T&D Losses.  Based on the present consumption data, KESC\u2019s T&D\nlosses are documented at 40.8 percent in FY2000. Determination of actual T&D losses is very\ndifficult because the power theft has been hidden by excess billing. However, with additional\ncollection by the army and other measures to reduce power theft, KESC has committed to\nreduce T&D losses by 6.0 percent in FY2001, 7.0 percent in FY2002 and 6.0 percent  in\nFY2003.\n5. Improvement in Bill Collection.  KESC\u2019s Accounts receivables as of 30 June 2000\nwere PRs18.5 billion, which is equivalent to 5.5 months of its energy sales. Currently, major\ndefaulters are the provincial governments and private sector. Arrears from the government of\nSindh and its local bodies to KESC were approximately PRs2 billion. As one of the conditions\nfor the first tranche and the incentive tranche release, net receivables have been reduced to 4.5\nmonth of sales by 21 November 2000 and public sector arrears are to be fully recovered  31\nJanuary 2001 and. KESC has also committed to further reduce its accounts receivable to 4.0\nmonths of sales by 30 June 2001, 3.5 months by 30 June 2002, and 3.0 months by 30 June\n2003.\n6. Financial Projections.  Based on the above assumptions, the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB)  prepared  financial  projections  up  to  30  June  2003,  which  were  agreed  to  by  the\nGovernment. A detailed description of KESC\u2019s projected financial performance and the resulting\ncash shortfall up to privatization is provided in Table A7.3. The summary of the cash shortfall\nprojection is given in Table A7.1.", "62\nAppendix 7, page2\nTable A7.1: Cashflow Projection for KESC\n(PRs billion)\n1998-99 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03\nItem\nActual Provisional Budget Projected Projected\nCash Collection 22.2 25.5 32.4 35.7 40.9\nFuel and Power Purchase 20.7 25.9 34.7 32.0 34.5\nOther Operating Expense 3.3 2.9 3.5 3.7 4.1\nCapital Expenditure 1.2 2.0 3.0 3.3 3.1\nDebt Service 5.2 7.8 9.0 10.6 10.2\nGross Cash Shortfall (11.4) (10.1) (17.2) (14.1) (10.7)\nMitigation Measures 1.1 0.4 0 0 0\nNet Cash Shortfall (10.3) (9.6) (17.2) (14.1) (10.7)\n     Cumulative Cash Shortfall (10.3) (19.9) (37.1) (51.2) (61.9)\nSource: KESC, ADB.\n7. Continued efforts to recover arrears and reduce power theft are expected to increase\ncash revenue by 17.0 percent per annum during FY2000 to FY2003, while energy demand is\nprojected to grow at 5.0 percent annually and no tariff increase is assumed in FY2002 and\nFY2003. Percentage of fuel and power purchase cost in cash revenue is expected to further\nincrease in FY2001 as a result of the recent hike of international oil prices. However, due to\nconversion from fuel oil to gas, the fuel and power purchase cost is projected to represent 84.0\npercent of cash revenue in FY2003, while it slightly exceeded cash revenue in FY2000.\n8. Despite an improvement of the overall cash flow position, KESC\u2019s operational cash flow\nwill not cover its minimum capital investment requirement and debt service obligations. The\ncumulative cash shortfall up to 30 June 2003 is estimated to be PRs61.9 billion. To keep KESC\nsolvent until privatization, this cash shortfall needs to be fully financed.\n9. In ADB\u2019s base case, no tariff increase is assumed after the most recent raise by 13\npaisa/kWh on 1 November 2000. However, ADB, through the policy matrix, encourages NEPRA\nto introduce a mechanism to automatically adjust in the tariff structure the cost for items such as\nfuel and taxes. If such a tariff setting mechanism is established, the average tariff of KESC will\nlikely be raised by 15.0 percent in FY2001, 8.0 percent in FY2002, and 8.0 percent in FY2003.\nSuch tariff increases would reduce KESC\u2019s cumulative cash shortfall from PRs61.9 billion to\nPRs40.3 billion by 30 June 2003.\nB.  Cash Shortfall Financing Plan\n10. The  cash  shortfall  of  PRs128.2  billion,  comprising  PRs91.8  billion  for  KESC  and\nPRs36.4 billion for WAPDA, needs to be financed to make the power sector current on its\npayment  obligations  and  to  keep  KESC  and  WAPDA  solvent  until  privatization.  The  cash\nshortfall for WAPDA was fully financed in FY2000 by converting PRs36.4 billion debt-servicing\nliabilities to the Government into equity. KESC\u2019s cumulative cash shortfall of PRs29.9 billion up\nto FY1998 was financed by the Government\u2019s financial restructuring package, approved by the\nCabinet in November 1998.\n11. The Government has fully committed to finance KESC\u2019s cash shortfall up to 30 June\n2003. The cumulative cash shortfall of PRs37.1 billion up to 30 June 2001 will be financed by (i)\nconversion of unpaid principal and interest to the Government outstanding as of 30 June 2000", "63\nAppendix 7, page3\ninto equity (PRs8.4 billion); (ii) conversion of overdue liabilities of fuel/power purchase into long-\nterm loan (PRs15.0 billion); (iii) on-lending of the first tranche of the proposed ADB loan (PRs9.0\nbillion); (iv) bridge financing from commercial banks, guaranteed by the Government (PRs4.7\nbillion). The Government will finance the cumulative cash shortfall for 1 July 2001 to 30 June\n2003, by the combination of budgetary allocation, debt-equity swap, on-lending of the second\ntranche of the proposed ADB loan, and refinancing of the existing term finance certificate (TFC).\nThe financing plan is detailed in Table A7.2.\nTable A7.2: Cash Shortfall Financing Plan\n(PRs billion)\nItem FY98 FY99 FY00 FY01 FY02 FY03 Total\nCash Shortfall for the Year\n  KESC 29.9 10.3 9.6 17.2 14.1 10.7 91.8\n  WAPDA 0 0 36.4 0 0 0 36.4\n          Total 29.9 10.3 46.0 17.2 14.1 10.7 128.2\nCash Shortfall Financing\n  Conversion of Government Loan to Equity 0 0 36.4b 8.4b 3.8b 3.7b 52.3\n  Conversion of Government Loan to Subdebt 9.6 0 0 0 0 0 9.6\n  Rollover of Government-Guaranteed Loan 7.4 0 0 0 0 0 7.4\n  Netting of Circular Debt 1.4 0 0 0 0 0 1.4\n  New Government-Guaranteed Loan/ ADB Loan 0 0 0 13.7  (0.4)c 0 13.3\n  TFC, Budgetary Allocation, etc. 11.5 0 0 15.0 10.7 7.0 44.2\n           Total 29.9 0 36.4 37.1 14.1 10.7 128.2\nNet Cumulative Cash Shortfall 0 10.3 19.9 0 0 0 30.2\nOther Financial Restructuring of KESCa\n  Conversion of Government  loan to Equity 0 3.0b 0 0 0 0 3.0\n  Conversion of Government Subdebt to Equity 0 0 0 9.6b 0 0 9.6\nADB = Asian Development Bank,  KESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, WAPDA = Water and Power Development\nAuthority.\na  No impact on cash flow.\nb  Restructuring cost incurred or to be incurred by the Government.\nc  Including repayment of the GOP guaranteed commercial loan.\nSource: KESC, ADB.\nC.  Restructuring Cost of the Power Sector\n12. As Table A7.2 shows, the Government has converted its loans to KESC and WAPDA\namounting to PRs39.4 billion ($762 million) into equity up to FY2000. Unlike other financial\nassistance by the Government, which is primarily in the form of guarantee, this debt write-off is\nconsidered a restructuring cost of the power sector. KESC\u2019s debt obligation of PRs25.5 billion\n($493 million), which the Government has committed to convert into equity from FY2001 to\nFY2003,  will  be  an  additional  restructuring  cost  to  be  incurred  by  the  Government.  The\nrestructuring cost may increase if further Government loans or Government-guaranteed loans\nare written off in the process of privatizing KESC and WAPDA although the cost can be partly\nrecouped by sale proceeds.", "64\nAppendix 7, page 4\nTable A7.3: KESC Financial Projection (ADB Base Case)\n(PRs million)\nItem FY99 FY00 FY01 FY02 FY03\nActual Provisional Budget Projected Projected\nOperational Assumptions\nDemand Growth 3.0% 7.5% 5.1% 5.0% 5.0%\nT&D Losses 38.6% 40.0% 33.4% 26.4% 20.4%\nTariff Increase 9.7% 4.5% 3.0% 0.0% 0.0%\nFuel Oil Price Change -11.5% 51.1% -9.1% 0.0% 0.0%\nIncome Statement Items\nTotal Sales (GWh)        6,131           6,443       7,534        8,755        9,952\nRevenue      23,781         26,145     31,402      36,421      41,345\nOperating Income      ( 4,323)          (7,141)    (11,201)       (4,059)       (2,236)\nNet Income      ( 7,483)        (12,896)    (17,244)       (9,461)       (6,942)\nCash Flow Statement Items\nCash Collection      22,246         25,521     32,441      35,706      40,968\nRevenue Expenditure      24,058         28,883     38,308      35,874      38,671\nCapital Expenditure        1,209           1,980       2,970        3,296        3,109\nWorking Capital Change        3,145          (3,400)         (824)          (179)          (507)\nDebt Servicing (Net)        5,211           7,802       9,045      10,641      10,205\nCash Surplus(Shortfall)    ( 11,377)        (10,065)    (17,186)     (14,080)     (10,689)\nBalance Sheet Items\nAccount Receivable (Net)      11,899         11,738     10,263      10,435      10,167\nNet Fixed Assets     4 9,751         49,298     50,442      50,553      50,331\nTotal Assets     6 9,610         65,837     65,415      65,310      64,950\nLong-term Debt      53,188         51,217     47,135      41,672      34,006\nEquity      ( 8,605)        (21,497)    (38,738)     (48,194)     (55,131)\nFinancial Ratios\nDebt Service Ratio -0.74 -0.68 -0.55 -0.01 0.29\nSelf Financing Ratio -281.6% -257.3% -439.9% -310.2% -242.2%\nCurrent Ratio 0.98 0.53 0.29 0.22 0.18\nLong-term Debt as Percentage of 119.3% 172.3% 561.3% -638.9% -161.0%\n     Long-term Debt + Equity\nNet Receivables (month) 6.1 5.5 4.0 3.5 3.0\nGWh = gigawatt-hour, T&D = transmission and distribution.\nSource: KESC, ADB.", "65\nAppendix 8, page 1\nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n1. The entire Karachi area is directly affected by the Government\u2019s restructuring program.\nThe current financial situation of the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC) leaves the\nGovernment with only two options: let KESC go bankrupt with no, or limited power supply in the\nKarachi area; or restructure and privatize KESC. Given the industrial base in Karachi and the\nimportance of the electricity supply for industrial growth and household welfare, the former\noption  is  not  acceptable.  The  current  corrupt  practices,  and  a  possible  decision  of  the\nGovernment to let KESC go bankrupt would impact the poor severely. Keeping KESC, as a\npublic utility, afloat with Government resources is not a sustainable solution as it nourishes\ncorruption and limits the Government\u2019s ability to invest in social and more growth enhancing\nsectors.\n2. This appendix is organized into three sections. The overview of the consumer base of\nKESC, presented in section A, gives a picture of the distributional implications of the current\nsituation. Section B provides an assessment of the direct and indirect impacts on the poor and\nmost  vulnerable  of  the  restructuring  program.  The  overall  macroeconomic  implications  for\npoverty reduction of the program is discussed in section C. A summary table of the expected\nimpacts is provided at the end of this appendix.\nA.  Overview\n3. The official electrification ratio in Karachi is 74.4 percent. The remaining 25.6 percent\ncomprises illegal connections (about 400,000) mainly by poor residential consumers. Table A8.1\npresents a dismal picture of significant underbilling of non-poor and commercial consumers, the\nmain cause of the deficit and cash short-fall for KESC.\n4. About 24.0 percent of the official consumer base of KESC are poor or low-income\nhouseholds1. These consumers are billed for nearly 21.0 percent of the total billed units with an\naverage consumption of 170 kWh per month. About 60.0 percent consume less than 100 kWh\nper month. Considering that the average consumption of electricity in Pakistan is 333 kWh per\nmonth, the corresponding figures for non-poor residential consumers in Karachi seem low,\nespecially since average consumption is normally higher in urban areas. More than 73.0 percent\nof commercial consumers are billed for less than 100 kWh per month; although commercial\nconsumers represent 19.5 percent of the consumer base, they only receive 15.0 percent of the\ntotal billed units.\nTable A8.1: Estimated Distribution of KESC Consumer Base\nConsumer Category\nResidential Commercial All\nPoor Non-poor Total\nConnections (%) 23.9 56.6 80.5 19.5 100.0\nBilled Amounts (%) 20.6 64.2 84.8 15.2 100.0\nAverage Units Billed (kWh) 170 225 209 154 198\nConsumer  Share  Billed  less\nthan 100 kWh (%) 59.7 37.5 45.8 73.4 51.2\n Source: KESC.\n                                                          \n1  Estimates of the distribution of the residential consumer base are based on geographical location of households.", "66\nAppendix 8, page 2\nB.  Poverty Impact Assessment of the Program\n5. Given the lack of empirical data for electricity expenditure ADB\u2019s Mission conducted a\nhousehold survey in low-income areas of Karachi to assess the preliminary direct and indirect\nimpacts on the poor.2 In addition, the Mission conducted in-depth discussions with small-scale\nbusinesses to assess consequences for economic activity directly affecting income-earning\nopportunities for the poor. The interviews focused on assessing the effects on the poor in terms\nof  quality  of  supply,  consumer  services,  expenditure  on  electricity,  vulnerability  to  corrupt\npractices, economic activity, and general welfare of households. Based on the outcome of the\nsurvey a technical assistance for a poverty impact assessment was formulated with components\nfor continued monitoring of the effects on the poor during the program implementation period\nand  capacity  building  to  consumer  participation  in  the  competitive  electricity  market.  The\ncapacity building was formulated with particular relevance to reducing the vulnerability of poor\nconsumers.\n6. The corrupt practices and KESC\u2019s consequent cash short-fall for KESC has affected\npoor  consumers  more  than  other  consumer  groups.  Whereas  non-poor  residential  and\ncommercial consumers area affected by power cuts resulting from deteriorating maintenance,\nthese are more frequent and persist for longer time periods in low-income areas of Karachi. In\naddition, non-poor consumers have often invested in generators to overcome the inconvenience\nof power cuts. Due to high initial capital costs this option is not available for poor consumers.\nThe initial assessment shows that 36.0 percent of the households interviewed suffered from loss\nof income as a result of power cuts. In addition, adverse impacts on general household welfare\nwere significant, including lack of sleep, mosquito bites, security problems, loss of study time,\nand general inconvenience, especially for children. Poor consumers are especially susceptible\nto corrupt practices in collection, billing and connection fees. The vulnerability of the poor is\nreinforced by the fact that these consumers face difficulties in monitoring their own electricity\nconsumption due to the irregularity of billing, lack of meter readings by KESC officials, and\nneglect in consumer services. The poor\u2019s vulnerability to extortion is exacerbated by illiteracy\nand inability to read their own meters. Corrupt practices have displaced resources in KESC\naway  from  provision  of  legal  connections.  Although  connection  fees  are  difficult  for  poor\nhouseholds to pay, they prefer legal connections because they are perceived to strengthen\nproperty rights. Improvements in the billing system, meter readings, and connection services are\nimportant tools for reducing the vulnerability of poor consumers. However, to address the\ninefficiencies in the billing and distribution departments, initial capital costs are required. KESC\nis trapped in a vicious cycle of low revenue collection and not being able to invest in measures\nthat would improve revenue collection. KESC has not, despite significant resources and efforts,\nbeen able to provide poor consumers with a fair share of benefits of the electricity sector.\n7. The key to addressing the vulnerability of poor consumers is to restore long-run financial\nviability of the electricity sector through restructuring and privatization, laying the foundation for\na competitive and (thus), cost effective electricity market. Although KESC\u2019s acute financial\nsituation will primarily be solved by reducing theft, some tariff increases reflecting cost recovery\nmay be expected in the short run. However, in the longer run increased competition will lead to\nefficiency  gains  and  ultimately  result  in  lower  tariffs.  The  current  average  expenditure  on\nelectricity among poor residential consumers is about 10.0 percent of cash income, well above\n                                                          \n2  In these areas, KESC had recently replaced illegal connections with legal ones.", "67\nAppendix 8, page 3\ninternational  comparisons.3  To  eliminate  the  adverse  impact  of  tariff  increases  on  poor\nconsumers, the lifeline tariff will be maintained.\nC.  Macroeconomic Impacts of the Program\n8. The macroeconomic impact of the program is pro-poor and has significant implications\nfor government spending on social sectors and public allocation of investments and the resulting\neffect on overall economic growth. KESC\u2019s current financial situation has diverted public funds\naway from social expenditures and other sectors that enhance economic growth that would\nbenefit the poor. For instance, the cash short-fall in KESC for the fiscal year (FY) 2000 is nearly\nequal to Government expenditure on social services: more than 1.7 times the expenditure on\neducation  or  5.0  times  the  expenditure  on  health.  Although  these  funds  may  not  be  fully\nfungible, allocation of funds to KESC has implications for the budget deficit and the options\navailable for the Government. The KESC cash short-fall for FY2000 amounts to 5.2 percent of\nthe fiscal deficit and is projected to increase to 7.2 percent for FY2001. Given Pakistan\u2019s overall\nfiscal deficit (5.8 percent of gross domestic product) the Government has limited resources to\nkeep KESC afloat. The fiscal deficit can primarily be financed through increasing money supply\nor by domestic and international borrowing. Printing money causes inflation, the burden of which\nfalls disproportionally on the poor. Borrowing crowds out private (and other public) investment,\ncrucial for economic growth and employment generation. Privatization of KESC and restoring\nfinancial health in the energy sector will reduce the burden on the Government deficit and\ninduce a more efficient allocation of resources for the economy as a whole.\n                                                          \n3  Electricity expenditure for low-income groups is usually 3.0-6.0 percent of income.
