In 2003, the Government of Viet Nam issued the Decree on Efficient Utilization of \nEnergy and Energy Conservation.1 Subsequently in 2005, the Ministry of Industry and Trade \n(MOIT) prepared a National Targeted Program on Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC) \nfor the period 2006\u20132015, which was approved by the Prime Minister on 14 April 2006. The \nProgram called for a concerted effort in improving energy efficiency, reducing energy losses, \nand instituting measures for improving energy conservation in all sectors of the economy. The \nProgram has time-bound targeted components and projects, with specific objectives and targets \nto be achieved by 2015 and beyond. \n2.  MOIT requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) \nto support the implementation of the Program, particularly in achieving the energy conservation \ntargets set for the industry sector. On the basis of the request, this TA2 was formulated to assist \nMOIT in undertaking steps to achieve the Program targets set for the industry sector. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Between 1990 and 2004, Viet Nam's energy consumption increased by about 11% per \nannum, 1.5 times the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate during the same period.   \nProjections made by Viet Nam\u2019s Institute of Energy envisage that energy demand will grow at \nabout 8% per annum until 2020 (GDP is projected to grow at 7.6% until 2015 and 7.2% \nthereafter until 2020). Currently energy utilization in Viet Nam can be characterized by (i) a lack \nof awareness of the benefits of energy conservation, (ii) a lack of skilled human resources to \nimplement demand side management, and (iii) high losses and low efficiency due to use of \nobsolete  technologies  and  equipment.  Initial  studies  undertaken  by  MOIT  show  that  the \npotential for energy conservation in the industry sector is about 20% of the current energy \nconsumption level and this potential is untapped. The high energy demand coupled with the lack \nof energy conservation measures has led to shortages in electricity supply, thus necessitating \nnew investments in generation that could otherwise have been deferred. \n4.  Viet Nam\u2019s industry sector is the largest energy consumer, accounting for 36% of the \ncountry\u2019s total energy consumption in 2006. This share will increase to 42% and 44% in 2010 \nand 2020, respectively. In terms of electricity consumption, that sector is also the biggest \nconsumer, accounting for about 46%. Thus, implementing energy saving measures in  industry  \nwill help reduce the demand for electricity and other energy fuels (fuel oil, diesel, coal, and \nnatural gas), which in turn will reduce the need for new investments in electricity generation and \nenergy production and consequently reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. \n5.  Viet Nam\u2019s industrial energy intensity was 0.50 ton of oil equivalent (toe)/$1,000 of GDP \nin 2002 and increased to 0.66 toe/$1,000 in 2006 (the corresponding values for Thailand and \nMalaysia are 0.40 and 0.38 toe/$1,000). The high energy intensity reflects inefficient utilization \nof energy in industry. which is largely due to (i) use of inefficient equipment and outdated \nproduction processes leading to high energy losses; and (ii) lack of regular energy management \npractices and energy audits within industrial enterprises. The latter is important as, without \nenergy audits, the potential for energy conservation cannot be identified and tapped. Further, \n                                                \n1  Decree No. 102/2003/ND-CP dated 03 September 2003. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 May 2007. ", "2\nlack of awareness of the benefits of energy conservation prevents commercial enterprises from \ninvesting in energy conservation. \n6.  The National Targeted Program on Energy Efficiency and Conservation is Viet Nam\u2019s first \ncomprehensive plan for setting up an institutional mechanism for sustained energy efficiency \nand  conservation  in  all  sectors  of  the  economy.  The  Program  uses  economic  incentives \ntogether with administrative measures to put in place day-to-day energy conservation practices \nin the whole society. The Program aims at achieving specific targets within a timeframe, to bring \nabout actual reductions in energy production and consumption. \n7.  The specific objectives of the Program are to (i) formulate and implement a framework for \neffective management of EEC within the government, enterprises, and public services, and  \nsociety as a whole; (ii) establish a model for EEC management and apply the model to 40% of \nthe  designated  energy  consumers/enterprises3 during  the  period  2006\u20132010  and  to  the \nremaining 60% by 2015; (iii) formulate and enforce an energy-efficient building code for all new \nbuildings  to  be  constructed  after  2008;  (iv)  achieve  3%\u20135%  reduction  of  the  total  energy \nconsumption in the country during 2006\u20132010 and 5%\u20138% reduction during 2011\u20132015 (this is \nequivalent to saving 5 million toe and 13 million toe in the two periods, respectively, based on a \nbusiness-as-usual scenario); (v) reduce energy consumption in the industry sector by 5% in \n2006\u20132010 and 8% in 2011-2015 (equivalent to energy savings of 2.6 and 5.0 million toe).  \n8.  The  Government  plans  to  institute,  through  a  decree,  best  practices  in  energy \nmanagement  in  industry  at  the  enterprise  level  as  an  integral  part  of  an  enterprise\u2019s \nbusiness  .plan.  To  attain  this  goal,  necessary  steps  have  been  identified  They  are  to  (i) \nestablish  energy  managers,  who  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  energy  use  in  their \nrespective organizations and taking measures to reduce consumption; (ii) establish professional \nenergy service companies (ESCOs) capable of providing a full package of energy services, \nincluding energy auditing, recommending feasible and practical measures to reduce energy \nconsumption  based  on  an  investment  plan;  (iii)  undertake  energy  audits  of  selected  large \nindustrial factories and recommend specific measures to cut down energy consumption; and (iv) \nby implementing some of the energy audit\u2019s recommendations in step (iii), demonstrate the \nbenefits of energy conservation on the productivity and profitability of  factories.  \n9.  As an initial source of potential ESCOs, Viet Nam has a number of energy centers, such \nas the Institute of Energy, the Energy Center in Hanoi University of Technology, and the Energy \nCenter in Ho Chi Minh City. There are also a number of small consulting companies active in \nenergy conservation issues. The centers carry out research and educational activities and at the \nsame time provide advisory services. However, they do not have sufficient technological know-\nhow, equipment, and experience to evolve into ESCOs.\n10.  The  key  challenge  MOIT  faces  is  the  lack  of  expertise  and  resources  needed  to \nimplement the steps identified (para. 8). MOIT also needs to mobilize in a coordinated manner \nthe available domestic resources and international assistance in implementing the Program. \nThe TA is designed to assist MOIT to overcome those constraints and to realize the energy \nconservation  opportunities  in  large  industrial  enterprises  by  upgrading  the  skills  of  energy \nmanagers, followed by identifying energy consumption patterns in the selected industries and \nthen undertaking energy audits that will lead to specific investment plans for achieving energy \nsavings in an economical manner. The TA would result in a strong demonstration effect for the \n                                                \n3  Designated consumers are those enterprises that consume every year more than 1,000 toe, or have installed \ncapacity of 500 kilowatts or more, or consume 3 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. ", "3\nwhole industry sector and would build confidence in the benefits of energy conservation. The TA \nis included in the Country Program and Strategy for 2007\u20132010. It is an integral part of ADB\u2019s \nplanned  assistance  to  Viet  Nam\u2019s  energy  sector,  which  includes  expanding  the  electricity \ngeneration and transmission system, establishing an electricity market, supporting power sector \nreform, increasing energy efficiency and conservation, and utilizing renewable energy. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA will promote energy conservation in the industry sector in Viet Nam so as to \nsubstantially reduce energy consumption while delivering a higher level of energy services to \nthe  sector.  The  envisaged  impact  of  the  TA  is  the  establishment  of  energy-efficient  best \npractices in the industry sector. Specifically, the TA will assist MOIT in achieving the target of \n5% and 8% reduction of energy consumption in large industrial enterprises by 2010 and 2015, \nrespectively.  The  TA  will  provide  MOIT  with  the  much-needed  expertise  and  tools  for  (i) \ndesigning and developing training methods and materials for energy managers in industrial \nenterprises; (ii) designing and conducting a survey of energy consumption in selected industrial \nenterprises, thus creating a basis for analyzing energy consumption patterns in industry; (iii) \nestablishing ESCOs that can provide auditing services and advise industrial enterprises on \nenergy conservation measures; (iv) piloting energy audits in selected industrial enterprises; and \n(v) translating the ensuing recommendations into an appropriate investment plan applicable for \nthe audited enterprises to implement as well as advising them on financing so as to realize the \nenergy-saving potential in a profitable manner.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA is structured into five components, some of which will be conducted in parallel. \nThe five components and their corresponding expected outputs are described below.  \n13. Component 1: Survey of Energy consumption in Industrial Enterprises. The survey \nwill collect, analyze, and identify patterns of energy consumption; examine features of energy \nmanagement and accounting in industrial factories; and categorize them according to existing \nVietnamese classification. The analyses will identify the areas for improving both the physical \ninfrastructure and managerial approaches. This component will involve (i) designing a survey \nmethodology  including  the  criteria  for  selecting  factories  to  be  included  in  the  survey;  (ii) \nconducting a survey of a number of factories using the survey sample and methodology, the \nresults of which will be used to calibrate the survey method and sample for the intended number \nof factories; (iii) analyzing the collected data and information to determine (a) the current energy \nconsumption  patterns  for  machinery  and  equipment,  (b)  the  relationship  between  energy \naccounting, production, and energy consumption; (iv) recommending action to improve energy \nconsumption characteristics for each industrial category;  and (v) estimating carbon dioxide \n(CO ) emission level of the whole sector based on the survey results. \n2\n14. Component  2:  Development  of  a  Training  Program  for  Energy  Managers. This \ncomponent will produce a standard curriculum and associated materials for training technical \nstaff of industrial enterprises, and staff of energy centers who will work on the management of \nenergy issues in the industry sector. The curriculum will be tailored to the Vietnamese situation \nand will be self-contained and reproducible. The training program will educate technical and \nmanagerial staff about the processes and key factors that influence energy consumption, and \nidentify areas for conserving energy in industrial factories. Activities for this component will \ninclude consulting with existing energy centers and institutes in preparing the energy training ", "4\ncurriculum, consisting of integrated modules each addressing an aspect of energy management \nin industry; and conducting short training courses using the developed materials and methods \nfor selected energy managers and technical staff. The training will be conducted on two fronts: \ntraining of energy managers on setting up energy management systems; and energy efficiency \ntechnical  training  for  the  engineers  and  other  technical personnel. Training  on  the  energy \nmanagement  system,  which  will  prepare  companies  for  long-term  sustainability  of  energy \nefficiency  initiatives,  will  include  organizing  an  energy  group,  prioritizing  energy  efficiency \nobjectives and targets, setting energy efficiency performance indicators, communicating EEC-\nrelated matters throughout the organization, and developing and implementing programs to \nachieve EEC goals and targets. The technical training will include EEC technologies, energy \naudit, data collection and on-site measurements, and data analysis and financial analysis. The \nintention is for the Energy Center in the Hanoi University of Technology; the Energy Center in \nHo Chi Minh City, and the Institute of Energy to retain the training methods and materials for \nsustainable application in the future.   \n15. Component 3: Conducting Energy Audits of Selected Large Industrial Enterprises.\nThis component will conduct energy audits of selected large industrial enterprises, analyze the \nresults to determine the measures to enhance energy efficiency, and recommend them to \nenterprise  managers  for  implementation.  It  will  also  prepare  a  plan  to  implement  these \nrecommendations including the costs required for equipment/process retrofitting. Activities in \nthis component will include (i) identifying, in collaboration with component 1 (survey),, industrial \nenterprises of designated categories for energy audits; (ii) planning and conducting full energy \naudits;  (iii)  preparing  audit  reports  that  analyze  issues  and  problems,  and  recommending \nimprovements, particularly for physical infrastructure, management, and corporate culture with \nrespect to energy use; and (iv) suggesting a concrete plan for applying the recommended \nmeasures, including an investment plan. \n16. Component  4:  Upgrading  the  Capacity  of  Existing  Energy  Centers  into \nProfessional ESCOs. This component will help set up several self-sustained ESCOs that can \nprovide a full range of energy services to interested industrial enterprises, including auditing, \ntraining, and assisting in implementing measures for energy conservation. The local experts \nwho work in components 1\u20133 will acquire good knowledge necessary for ESCOs services. This \ncomponent involves (i) assessing the capacity of existing energy centers in Viet Nam with \nregard to staff skills and technical capability in providing energy services; (ii) identifying the \ntechnical and human resources gaps that need to be bridged to bring these centers to the level \nof independent ESCOs; (iii) preparing a plan to bridge these gaps; (iv) preparing a list of \nnecessary equipment and the associated costs; training course needs; and providing initial \ntraining in conjunction with a subcomponent  of component 2. \n17. Component 5: Devising a Mechanism for Financing Energy Conservation Plans for \nIndustrial  Enterprises.  This  component  will  develop  a  financing  modality  that  will  help \nindustrial enterprises access financial sources for investment in EEC. The financing modality will \nfacilitate mobilization of the possible multilateral financial sources (ADB included) and channel \nthem, through local financial institutions (LFIs), to industrial enterprises. Such financial modality \nwill ensure smooth linkages between financial sources with energy conservation projects. This \ncomponent involves (i) holding dialogues with LFIs to assess their perception of the risk in \nfinancing energy conservation projects, their capability to appraise these projects and to assess \nthe associated risks; (ii) preparing a plan to upgrade LFI capabilities; (iii) conducting dialogues \nwith  interested  industrial  enterprises,  especially  those  that  have  been  provided  with  the \ninvestment plans under component 4 so as to estimate a market potential for financing; and (iv) ", "5\npreparing a protocol for negotiating an agreement between potential development partners and \nLFIs that are willing to serve as intermediaries to finance energy conservation projects.   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,160,000 equivalent. The TA will be cofinanced \non a grant basis by the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance ($425,000) and the \nGovernment of France through the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement4 ($500,000), and \nadministered by ADB. The Government will finance $235,000 equivalent in kind by providing \ncounterpart staff, office space and facilities, reports, and support services. The detailed cost \nestimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.

On the basis of \nthe results, revise the survey method and sample design, if necessary, before \nconducting a full survey of the intended number of industrial enterprises. \n(vi)  Analyze the collected data and information so as to (a) draw conclusions on \ntypical features of current energy consumption patterns of a given category of \nindustrial enterprises; reasons behind these features; the relationship between \nmachinery  and  equipment  status  and  energy  consumption;  the  relationship \nbetween energy bookkeeping and production priority and energy consumption; \nand  (b)  calculate  CO   emissions  of  surveyed  enterprises  and  estimate  the \n2\nsectoral CO  emission, given the trend of energy consumption.  \n2\n(vii) Suggest actions to improve the energy consumption situation for each industrial \ncategory. Liaise with and provide necessary information and inputs for other sub-\ntasks.\nB.  Component 2: Develop a Program for Training Energy Managers (international \nenergy conservation specialist [3] and national energy conservation educator [5]) \n5. The consultants will produce a standard curriculum and associated materials for training \nengineers  and  staff  of  industrial  enterprises,  energy  centers,  and  research  institutes.  The \ntraining program will give engineers and managers information about the process and key \nfactors  that  influence  energy  consumption  and  areas  where  energy  can  be  conserved  in \nindustrial enterprises. The training program has two parts: (i) training energy managers on \ndeveloping and setting up energy management systems, and (ii) energy efficiency technical \ntraining for engineers and technical personnel.  The first part will prepare companies for long-\nterm sustainability of energy efficiency initiatives and should include organizing an energy group; \ndeveloping an energy policy; prioritizing energy efficiency objectives and targets; setting energy \nefficiency metrics or performance indicators; communicating energy efficiency and conservation \n(EEC)-related matters throughout the organization; developing and implementing strategies and \nprograms to achieve EEC goals and targets; and developing documentation such as EEC \nguidelines  and  procedures,  reviews,  system  audits,  and  monitoring  and  measurements  to \nanticipate problems and keep performance on track. The technical training (part 2) will include \nEEC technologies, energy audit, data collection and on-site measurements, and data analysis \nincluding use of statistical tools such as scatter-gram, histogram, cause-and-effect diagrams, \nand financial analysis.  The consultants working on this task will undertake these tasks. \n(i)  Review  available  public  awareness  materials  produced  to  date,  including \nguidelines, brochures, leaflets, etc.; and summarize the content, application, and \nusefulness of the materials. Distinguish between public awareness materials and \nspecialized training materials. \n(ii)  In consultation with the Energy Conservation Office of the Department of Science \nand Technology (DST) and DST, and Institute of Energy, Energy Center in Hanoi \nUniversity of Technology, Energy Center in Ho Chi Minh City, prepare an energy \ntraining curriculum, which comprises a reasonable number of integrated modules, \neach addressing an aspect of energy management in industry as described in the \npreceding paragraph. ", "Appendix 3 11\n(iii)  Develop the full content of each module, including lecture notes, presentation \nmaterials, and experimental works, if necessary. Prepare, edit, and publish such \nmaterials in English and Vietnamese. \n(iv)  Assess the capability of the institutions cited in (ii), and propose a pilot training \ncourse for selected energy managers and engineers. \n(v)  Conduct a short training course in the northern, central, and southern regions, \nusing the developed methodology and materials. \n(vi)  Work  with  the  Institute  of  Energy,  Energy  Center  in  Hanoi  University  of \nTechnology, and Energy Center in Ho Chi Minh City to transfer the materials and \nknowledge so that these centers can maintain and conduct training on their own. \nC.  Component 3: Audit Selected Industrial Enterprises (international energy auditor \n[5] and national energy service specialist [6]) \n6.  The consultants will conduct a full-fledged energy audit in selected (based on the survey) \nindustrial  enterprises  and  provide  fact-based  recommendations  for  achieving  energy \nconservation targets.  The audits should look at all the resources being used by the enterprise \nand  not  be  confined  to  energy  alone.  This  can  be  done  using  the  cleaner  production-\nenvironmental  management  system  approach.  For  example,  saving  water  means  saving \npumping energy and possibly energy used in water and effluent treatment; improving product \nquality reduces energy uses in rework or product rejects. The consultants are required to \nundertake the following specific tasks. \n(i)  Utilizing the outputs produced by the survey and the training,  prepare the criteria \nfor selecting industrial enterprises for auditing; identify industrial enterprises that \npotentially  will  benefit  from  the  energy  conservation  improvement  in  each \nindustrial designated category; and set up a list of enterprises to be audited. The \nenterprises to be audited should not be less than 10. \n(ii)  Prepare  an  audit  plan  for  each  enterprise  in  liaison  with  the  respective \nmanagement; prepare a detailed timetable involving auditing tasks and install \naudit equipment if necessary. \n(iii)  Conduct a full energy audit for the intended enterprises. \n(iv)  Prepare  an  audit  report  analyzing  issues  and  problems,  and  recommend \nmeasures particularly for physical infrastructure; and management and corporate \nculture with respect to energy use. \n(v)  Based on the audit results, propose a set of measures to enhance the energy use \nsituation and recommendations to improve energy efficiency and conservation. \nSet out a detailed plan for implementing such recommendations including, if \nnecessary,  the  investment  required  for  equipment/process  maintenance,  or \noverhaul. Suggest a concrete implementation plan for those measures. \nD.
