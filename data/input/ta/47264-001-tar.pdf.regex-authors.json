The three north Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB)\u2014the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), the Federated States of Micronesia \n(FSM), and the Republic of Palau\u2014are former trust territories of the United States (US). The RMI \nand FSM entered into the first Compacts of Free Association with the US in 1986, and Palau \nfollowed in 1994.1 The RMI and FSM have executed Compact II (2004\u20132023), while Palau \nrenegotiated its compact in 2010 and is awaiting congressional approval. A major concern for all \nthree countries is the planned decrement of Compact grants over the next decade and the \nimpacts of this on fiscal sustainability and service provision. Currently, about 70% of the national \nbudget of the RMI and 45% of that of FSM depends on Compact grant transfers from the US. \nThese economies also depend on US federal government agency programs for key sector \nbudgets such as education and health. \n \n2.  A major feature of the amended compacts for the RMI and FSM is the establishment of \nCompact trust funds to ensure long-term budgetary self-reliance and provide the governments \nwith appropriate fiscal resources after 2023. Unfortunately, the trust funds have not grown at a \nsufficient rate to replace the decrement in Compact transfers. With the Compact period running \nout in 2023, the three Pacific DMCs are undertaking reforms to ensure macroeconomic and \nfiscal sustainability beyond 2023. \n \n3.  Initial discussions between ADB and the governments of the RMI, FSM, and Palau have \nresulted in an understanding regarding the impact, outcome, and outputs of the  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA), as well as its costs, implementation arrangements, and terms of \nreference for consulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Strengthening public sector management has been identified as a critical priority for all \nthree countries as they put in place long-term plans aimed at better managing their limited \nresources  while  ensuring  an  acceptable  standard  of  public  service  delivery.  While  the \ngovernments readily acknowledge the need for economic reforms for the post-Compact period, \nthey  need  to  clearly  understand  the  implications  on  macroeconomic  stability  and  fiscal \nsustainability. Individually, the countries have identified critical reform areas for public sector \nmanagement requiring support from ADB and other development partners. These include (i) \nstrengthening  public  financial  management  policies  and  processes,  (ii)  improving  service \ndelivery through public service reforms, (iii) strengthening economic analysis to support policy \ndevelopment and inform better decision making, (iv) strengthening planning capacities to put the \nlong-term visions of the countries into operation, and (v) advancing state-owned enterprise \n(SOE) reforms to improve performance. \n \n5.  Public  financial  management. The  RMI,  FSM,  and  Palau  all  face public  financial \nmanagement  challenges  on  both  the  revenue  and  expenditure  side.  The  three  countries \nrecently underwent public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessments, which \nnoted that efforts to improve public financial and economic management will yield better results \nand impacts when conducted within a long-term comprehensive and programmatic approach. \nPublic financial management (PFM) plans have been developed to address priority challenges \n                                                \n1  Under the compacts, the RMI, FSM, and Palau receive direct budget contributions. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 November 2013.  \n ", "2   \nidentified by the PEFAs, and the TA will support the implementation of key areas as discussed \nwith the individual governments.   \n \n6.  Public administration. The RMI, FSM, and Palau have requested ADB support for \npublic administration reforms. The drive for reform has come about because of the impacts of \nrelatively large wage bills on national budgets and inefficiencies in public sector service delivery. \nADB is already supporting activities in the RMI and FSM, hence the TA will build on this and \nalso include Palau. Under TA to the RMI in 2010 for supporting the public sector program, ADB \nsupported (i) workforce audits and planning in five ministries and agencies (finance, foreign \naffairs, internal affairs, attorney-general\u2019s office, and resources and development) as well as in \nthe Nitijela (Parliament) of the Government of the RMI; and (ii) development of a strategic plan \nand  associated  work  plan  for  the  Public  Service  Commission.3 TA  to  FSM  is  helping  the \ngovernment to (i) conduct an organizational assessment of the national government\u2019s public \nadministration and national public service system, (ii) prepare options for alternative institutional \nand organizational arrangements for consideration by the Office of the President of the RMI, \nand (iii) revise the national public administration operational manuals.4 The TA will provide \nfollow-on support for FSM, while the RMI has requested assistance for a human resource \nmanagement information system (HRMIS). Palau is seeking support to (i) develop a human \nresource  development plan,  including  a framework for retention  and succession to  ensure \ncontinuity of the civil service; and (ii) strengthen links between its human resources and financial \nmanagement information systems. \n \n7.  Economic management. A major concern for the three Pacific DMCs is the impact of \nthe decrement of Compact grants on long-term macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability. All \nrecognize a critical need to have the necessary economic analyses to make good projections in \norder for the governments to develop necessary policies to minimize any adverse impact on the \neconomies. The support needed includes developing medium- and long-term macroeconomic \nframeworks, and strengthening economic statistical and analytical capacities to support policy \ndevelopment and inform decision making. The three Pacific DMCs are highly dependent on the \nInternational Monetary Fund Article IV missions, as well as on the Graduate School USA\u2019s \nPacific Island Training Initiative annual economic review for economic analyses.5 However, \nthere is also a need for more regular and intermittent advice as needed, hence the desire to \nstrengthen internal economic analytical capacities. \n \n8.  Planning. The three Pacific DMCs have prepared long-term development strategies in \nanticipation of the expiration of their Compact. The RMI is currently preparing a 3-year rolling \nnational development plan to be presented at the Second Development Partners Forum in early \n2014. ADB will support the implementation and monitoring of the plan.6 FSM developed a \ndevelopment  framework  that  was  presented  during  the  Development  Partners  Forum  in \nNovember 2012 and endorsed by the government.7 FSM has requested support to prepare \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2010.

Palau has a medium-term \ndevelopment strategy, supported by the management action plan of the new administration.8 \nThe governments  recognize  the  need for good  medium-term  planning,  with  better  links to \nresource allocations, if they are to achieve their longer-term visions. \n \n9.  State-owned  enterprise  reform.  The  three  Pacific  DMCs  recognize  that  structural \nreforms,  particularly  SOE  reforms,  are  also  a  necessary  part  of  a  holistic  approach  to \nstrengthening public sector management. Transfers to SOEs are significant expenditures on the \nnational budgets, hence there is a need to develop a reform program to (i) improve SOE \nperformance,  (ii)  put  in  place  regulatory  frameworks,  and  (iii)  provide  a  mechanism  for \ndivestment  options. The  objective  of the reform  program  is to  minimize  the  drain  of SOE \ntransfers on the national budgets while ensuring that a minimum standard of service delivery is \nmaintained. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be increased self-reliance and fiscal sustainability. The outcome will be \nmore efficient macroeconomic and fiscal management. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA  will  (i)  strengthen  public  financial  management,  (ii)  strengthen  public \nadministration  systems,  (iii)  improve  economic  management  by  strengthening  analytical \ncapacities to support policy development and inform decision making, (iv) strengthen planning \ncapacities both in the long and medium term, and (v) improve the performance of SOEs. Under \nthe TA, the sharing of experiences and best practices at the regional level will also be facilitated. \n \n12.  The TA will have the following outputs: \n \n13.  Output 1: Improved public financial management. The TA will work closely with the \ngovernments  to  implement  prioritized  activities  in  their  PFM  plans,  focusing  on  budget \nprocesses and financial reporting. There will be close collaboration with the Pacific Financial \nTechnical Advisory Centre, which has supported preparation of the PFM plans for the RMI and \nFSM. \n \n14.  Output 2: Improved public administration systems. ADB is currently helping FSM to \nconduct  an  organizational  assessment  of  its  national  public  service,  prepare  options  for \nalternative institutional and organizational arrangements, and update its public services manual. \nThe TA will support the implementation of a new national public administration structure. In the \nRMI, the TA for the public sector program supported the conduct of workforce audits and \nplanning  in  selected  government  agencies,  and  developed  a  strategic  plan  for  the  Public \nService Commission. The RMI has requested TA support to help explore options for an HRMIS, \nwhich will also strengthen links to the government financial management system. The TA will \nprovide similar support to Palau.  \n \n                                                \n8  Government of the Republic of Palau. 2009.

The management action plan adopted by the new administration supports the thrust of the \ndevelopment strategy. \n ", "4   \n15.  Output  3:  Strengthened  economic  analytical  capacities.  Under  the  TA,  a \nmacroeconomist and economic adviser will be retained to provide advice to the three countries \nand help prepare a long-term macroeconomic framework. The adviser will collaborate closely \nwith the US Graduate School review teams and the International Monetary Fund Article IV \nmissions. At the operational level, under the TA a long-term economic analyst will be provided \nfor FSM as well as capacity development in economic analysis to  the RMI and Palau as \nneeded. The TA team will work closely with the Pacific Economic Management TA team to \nensure support in this area is complementary.9 \n \n16.  Output 4: Strengthened planning capacities. The three countries have prepared long-\nterm frameworks in anticipation of Compact expiration in 2023. The TA will support preparation \nof  a  medium-term  rolling  plan  for  FSM  to  put  into  operation  its  long-term  development \nframework.  The  TA  will  support  Palau  to  strengthen  links  between  planning  and  budget \nprocesses. From a regional perspective, under the TA the individual peer reviews conducted by \nthe  Pacific  Islands  Forum  Secretariat  on  all  three  countries  will  be  reviewed,  and  a \ndetermination  made  on  how  common  issues  can  be  addressed  through  a  subregional \napproach.10 \n \n17.  Output  5:  Improved  state-owned  enterprise  performance.  While  ADB\u2019s  Private \nSector Development Initiative will continue to provide support to the policy, legal, and regulatory \nactivities of SOE reforms, the TA will provide support at the operational level by implementing \nrestructuring activities and capacity development in areas such as financial management. TA \nsupport will focus initially on the RMI and expand to FSM and Palau as needed. \n \n18.  Output 6: Enhanced regional sharing of knowledge and best practices. The TA will \nsupport  regional  integration  by  facilitating  knowledge-sharing  events  to  allow  government \nofficials  to  share  experiences  and  best  practices,  and  by  exploring  options  for  exchange \nprograms.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.67 million, of which $1.50 million will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V). The governments  will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-\nkind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency and implementation responsibilities will rest with the \nPacific Department in coordination with the appropriate national ministries and agencies. No TA \nactivities will be undertaken in the territory of the three participating DMCs until a no-objection \nconfirmation has been obtained from the governments of the DMCs concerned. \n \n21.  The proposed TA will be implemented over a period of 3 years from 1 January 2014 to \n31 December 2016. It will finance up to 35 person-months of international consultant inputs and \n15 person-months of national consultant inputs. The TA has been designed to flexibly address \nthe  needs  and  priorities  of  the  participating  governments,  hence  consulting  services \n                                                \n9 ADB. 2011.

Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  The TA will be monitored by relevant country team leaders and sector and thematic \nspecialists through regular ADB missions. Expected TA outputs will be shared through reports \nand knowledge products to participating Pacific DMCs and other stakeholders. Lessons and \ngood practices identified will be shared at the regional level where opportunities arise. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.
