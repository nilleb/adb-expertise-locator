Maharashtra is the leading contributor to India\u2019s economy, accounting for 14.3% of the \nnational gross domestic product in fiscal year 2020. However, the state is also ranked among the \nhighest in the income and development inequalities, as economic development is concentrated \nonly in major cities. The central and state governments target to raise farmers\u2019 incomes by \npromoting agribusiness development and aggregating crops of small and marginal landholding \nfarmers through organized farmer producer organizations (FPOs). Horticulture crops such as \nfruits, vegetables, and flowers have high value but are highly perishable; almost 40% are lost or \nwasted in different stages of the agriculture value chains. The losses can be reduced by proper \npost-harvest practices and agriculture value chain facilities. The project is also built on the grant \nproject funded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), which piloted promotion of \nhorticulture FPOs in Maharashtra.1 \n  \n2.  The  proposed  Maharashtra  Agribusiness  Network  Project  will  support  the  state \ngovernment of Maharashtra through a holistic approach combining a project loan and financial \nintermediation  loans.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  achieve  average \nagriculture sector growth rate of 5%; promote agriculture produce export; and establish fair, \ncompetitive, and accessible agriculture markets.2 The project\u2019s outcome is that Maharashtra\u2019s \nhorticultural production values and FPOs\u2019 profits will be increased. The outputs comprise (i) \ninstitutional,  technical,  and  marketing  capacities  of  agribusiness  institutions  and  FPOs \nstrengthened; (ii) access to finance of FPOs and value chain operators (VCOs) strengthened; and \n(iii) agriculture value chain infrastructure improved and operational. The project is estimated to \ncost $142.9 million, of which $100.0 million will be funded by Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nordinary capital resources (regular loan). \n \n3.  The project has the following innovative and demonstrative elements. This transaction \ntechnical assistance (TA) will support delivery of the following finance-plus elements and replicate \nthem within and outside India through the capacity development resource center in the India \nResident Mission, workshops, and regional forums including ADB\u2019s Rural Development and Food \nSecurity Forum.3  \n(i)  Innovative technology. Based on a list of innovative technologies identified \nduring  project  preparation,  the  project  will  (a)  directly  apply  some  to  facility \nimprovements, (b) give guidance to FPOs and VCOs, and (c) promote their \napplication through financial support.4 These technologies cover various stages of \nagribusiness such as aggregation, storage, processing, logistics, and marketing \nincluding digital agriculture services for direct marketing and higher sales prices.5 \n(ii)  Centers of excellence network. Capacity development activities will be linked to \nresearch and development activities of  the National Institute of Post-Harvest \nTechnology and associated research centers. A network of institutions will be \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2010. Improving Small Farmers\u2019 Access to Market in Bihar and Maharashtra.  \nManila (Grant 9147-IND); and ADB. 2020.

Digital traceability systems benefit value addition in farmers\u2019 produce, safety certification for consumers, \nand price transparency. Smallholder farmers can also benefit from digital agriculture services that provide market \nintelligence; precise weather and harvest advisories; and access to quality inputs, logistics, and financial services. \n ", "2 \ndeveloped to holistically provide support to FPOs and farmers on good agricultural \npractices, new crop varieties, and other technical innovations. \n(iii)  Exemplary value chains led by farmer producer organizations. The project will \ndevelop exemplary value chains led by FPOs which successfully link with rapidly \ngrowing retailers and bring higher FPO shares in sales revenue. \n(iv)  Value  chain  acceleration.  The  newly  established  Maharashtra  Agribusiness \nNetwork (MAGNET) Society will be developed to be a value chain accelerator, \nwhich will offer crop-based support to develop FPOs and collectively market their \nproducts with higher brand values.  \n(v)  Gender mainstreaming and social inclusion. The project will support poor and \nvulnerable small-scale farmers to enhance their income opportunities. Mahila \nArthik Vikas Mahamandal will depute staff and work with the MAGNET Society to \nensure that women and FPOs and VCOs owned or led by women are promoted \nand given priorities in capacity development and financial support. The gender \nequality and social inclusive action plan will enhance inclusive project benefits to \nwomen and other vulnerable groups. \n \n4.  Follow-up actions from the previous Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant. The \nJFPR grant project (footnote 1) was implemented from July 2010 to December 2018 to enhance \nintegration of small-scale horticulture farmers into modern value chains by (i) organizing farmers \ninto farmer groups, (ii) building their capacity to increase production, and (iii) establishing market \nlinks. The grant project was implemented successfully with most of the targets achieved, including \nestablishment  of  1,404  FPOs  and  delivery  of  capacity  enhancement  trainings.  The \nimplementation completion memorandum suggested the following follow-up actions: (i) continued \nsupport  to  FPOs  and  farmer  producer  companies  is  necessary  to  develop  their  technical \nknowledge of modern farming practices; (ii) strengthening buyer\u2013seller links should be considered \nto ensure sustainability of project outputs; and (iii) participation of women should be ensured in \nagriculture and value-addition activities. The proposed project and this TA were built on the \nsuccessful implementation of the JFPR grant and will address the follow-up actions. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  The proposed project will provide ADB\u2019s value addition through the finance-plus elements \nwith support from the proposed TA. The TA will complement the proposed project by introducing \ninternational good practices and providing capacity development to the MAGNET Society and \nother stakeholders in the finance-plus elements. The TA is proposed to be attached rather than \nbe made part of the loan to maintain continuity with ADB\u2019s past TA support and allow for efficient \nconsultant management and close supervision by ADB. This transaction TA is listed in the country \noperations business plan for India, 2021\u20132023.6 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.

The TA was envisaged for only $1 million \nto be financed by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), but the amount was increased \nduring the project preparation stage to ensure sustainable project results and mitigate implementation risks. \n7  The JFPR is a possible funding source subject to Government of Japan approval. \n ", "3 \nSpecial Fund (TASF-other sources).
