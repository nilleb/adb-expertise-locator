The FSPL consists of three back-to-back subprograms\nthat  will  be  implemented  within  36  months  after  loan\neffectiveness.\nThe Program\nRationale Cambodia\u2019s financial sector is at a rudimentary stage with limited\nfinancial  intermediation  and  low  public  confidence.  An\nunderdeveloped financial system is one of the most significant\nconstraints  to  achieving  broad-based  sustainable  economic\ngrowth and socioeconomic development objectives of the Royal\nGovernment of Cambodia (the Government), including poverty\nreduction. Financial sector development has been hampered by\nnumerous  constraints:  (i)  high  risk  related  to  uncertainties\nregarding law and contract enforcement due to lack of the rule of\nlaw, (ii) high information costs stemming from lack of common\naccounting  and  auditing  standards  and  other  information\ninfrastructure, (iii) high operating costs due to the absence of\nliquidity  management  mechanisms  and  other  market\ninfrastructure, and (iv) weak supervisory system and capacity.\nThe FSPL will support the Government\u2019s efforts to address these\nconstraints  and  lay  the  foundation  for  financial  sector\ndevelopment. A sound, efficient, and integrated financial system\nis crucial for achieving broad-based sustainable economic growth\nand reducing poverty by enlarging job opportunities, lowering the\ntransaction  costs  of  economic  activities,  and  extending  the\noutreach of the formal financial sector to poor and rural areas. An\nefficient financial system will promote private sector development\nas well as foreign direct investments. Further, a robust financial\nsector  will  protect  the  economy  from  unfavorable  exogenous\nshocks  that  are  becoming  more  common  in  increasingly\nglobalized financial markets.\nObjective and The FSPL aims to promote the development of a sound, market-\nScope based  financial  system  to  support  enhanced  resource\nmobilization and sustainable economic growth by establishing a\nfoundation for the banking and insurance industries as well as\nfinancial markets. the FSPL will focus on the following activities:\n(i)  enhancing banking intermediation and public confidence\nby  establishing  and  strengthening  banking  supervision,\ndeveloping key information infrastructure and safety net,\nand building capacity in both public and private sectors by", "ii\nreinforcing capacity-building institutions;\n(ii)  establishing legal and regulatory frameworks for insurance\ndevelopment by institutionalizing a supervisory system and\nprudential  regulations,  fostering  private  sector\ndevelopment in the insurance business, and developing\ncompulsory insurance;\n(iii)  laying the foundation for the development of interbank and\nmoney markets through public-private sector partnership\nand by establishing a basic legal framework; and\n(iv)  developing  the  financial  market  infrastructure  by\nestablishing  common  accounting  standards  and\nenforcement  mechanisms  and  promulgating  laws  to\nunderpin the commercial activities and financial markets.\nClassification Economic growth\nEnvironmental Category C. Environmental implications were reviewed, and no\nAssessment significant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\nThe ADB Loan\nAmount and Terms The FSPL adopts the program cluster approach with three back-\nto-back subprograms totaling $30 million. Each subprogram loan\nwill be for $10 million and will be processed upon the successful\ncompletion of the previous subprogram.\nSubprogram I of FSPL will be drawn from the Asian Development\nFund, which will have a repayment period of 24 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years, and carry an interest rate of 1.0 percent\nper annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter. Subprogram I will be implemented within 12 months\nafter loan effectiveness.\nSubprogram II will be presented for Board consideration, based\non progress in implementing Subprogram I. Policy conditions for\nSubprogram II are subject to revision to reflect the Government\u2019s\nachievements and changing policy environment. Subprogram III\nwill be processed in a similar manner.  Subprograms II and III will\nbe implemented within 12 months after loan effectiveness.\nProgram Period The  loan  for  Subprogram  I  will  be  utilized  within  18  months,\nand Tranching commencing  from  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  loan\nproceeds may be used to finance eligible imports procured 180\ndays before the date of effectiveness. The loan will have two\ntranches; the first will be available upon loan effectiveness, and\nthe second will be released upon satisfactory compliance with\nspecified conditions indicated in the policy matrix.", "iii\nExecuting Agency The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) will be the Executing\nAgency for the FSPL and Implementing Agencies will be The\nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF),  the  Ministry  of\nCommerce  (MOC),  NBC,  and  the  bankers  association  when\nformed.  A  financial  sector  steering  committee  (FSSC)  will  be\nestablished to oversee implementation of the FSPL. FSSC will be\nchaired  by  the  governor  of  NBC  and  will  include  senior\nrepresentatives from MEF, MOC, NBC, and the Council for the\nDevelopment  of  Cambodia.  A  working  group  will  be  also\nestablished under FSSC to assist FSSC and oversee day-to-day\nprogram implementation.\nProcurement and The proceeds of the FSPL will be disbursed for a broad range of\nDisbursement imports, subject to compliance with a negative list of ineligible\nitems. All procurement of goods and services produced in and\noriginating in member countries of the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB)  will  be  made  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and\nefficiency in accordance with standard public sector procedures\nin Cambodia and normal private sector commercial practices,\nacceptable to ADB. The Borrower will certify that the volume of\neligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  the  projected\ndisbursements under the ADB loan in a given period. ADB will\nhave the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify\nthe accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\nCounterpart Funds The policy framework for the FSPL includes specific components\nthat bear distinct costs of structural adjustments. The counterpart\nfunds to be generated from the loan proceeds will be used to\nfinance the structural adjustment costs under the FSPL.\nRisks and The  principal  risk  lies  in  unexpected  political  disturbance.\nSafeguards Cambodia will go into a political season in early 2002, as the\nNational  Assembly  and  the  Senate  of  Cambodia  passed  the\nCommune  Election  and  Commune  Administration  Laws  in\nJanuary and February 2001, respectively. There may be risks\nassociated with weak capacity at the institution level, the ability to\nrecruit  and  retain  qualified  cadres  and  staff,  and  poor\ncoordination  between  policy-making  agencies.  There  may  be\nanother risk related to \u201claw fatigue.\u201d Given the deficient legal\nenvironment in Cambodia, the Government has been expediting\nsubstantial  volume  of  legislation  in  a  relatively  short  period.\nHowever, there have been some cases where adopted laws are\nnot fully implemented, despite all the efforts of the Government\nand aid agencies.\nThe  FSPL  includes  safeguards  in  the  design  of  the  overall\nframework  of  assistance.  First,  it  adopts  the  program  cluster\napproach, which introduces flexibility to accommodate various\ntypes of risks by allowing further refinement of policy conditions\nreflecting  changing  circumstances.  The  FSPL  will  be  also\nsupported by technical assistance (TA) to reduce the downside", "iv\nrisks  from  weak  capacity.  An  advisory  TA  will  assist  the\nGovernment in implementing the policy reform measures. Risks\nassociated  with  \u201claw  fatigue\u201d  can  be  minimized  by  instituting\nprocedures for broad and regular consultation with the private\nsector  stakeholders.  On  25  January  2001,  the  Government\nadopted the Prime Minister\u2019s Decision on the Formation of a\nSectoral Working Group for Consultation Partnership with the\nPrivate Sector, which mandated the creation of procedures for\nprivate  sector  consultation  in  seven  major  areas  including\nbanking and financial services. While it is understood that the\nprocedure can also be utilized as a private sector consultation\nprocedure for legislation, the FSPL supports the adoption of a\nformal consultation procedure for legislation in the banking sector\nas one of the policy conditions of Subprogram I.", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a (i) proposed\nprogram cluster concept for the Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL); and (ii) proposed loan\nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for Subprogram I of the FSPL.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In  May  1999,  the  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia  (the  Government)  requested\nassistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to develop its financial sector. In response,\nADB assisted the Government in developing a preliminary financial sector road map for the next\n20 years through a financial sector study, which was completed in June 1999. With technical\nassistance (TA)1 and building on the preliminary road map, a comprehensive financial sector\ndiagnostic review was completed in January 2001, and the Financial Sector Blueprint for 2001-\n2010 (Appendix 1) was prepared in March 2001 to serve as the long-term development strategy\nand phased financial sector development plan. On 24 August 2001, the Government adopted\nthe Blueprint as its official development plan in the financial sector at a Cabinet meeting chaired\nby the Prime Minister.\n3. The  Loan  Fact-Finding  Mission2  which  visited  Cambodia  in  April  2001  reached\nunderstanding with the Government on policy reforms that are to be supported by the ADB\nloans,  the  program  structure  (use  of  the  program  cluster  approach  for  the  FSPL),  its\nsubcomponents and tranching conditions, and the implementation arrangements. The Appraisal\nMission3 in July 2001 confirmed and refined the policy conditions for the proposed FSPL and\nimplementation arrangements, and drafted a development policy letter in consultation with the\nGovernment. The development policy letter and policy matrix for the FSPL are in Appendixes 2\nand 3.\nIII.  MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA.  Development Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n4. After a long-standing domestic turmoil and subsequent international isolation in the\n1980s, Cambodia started returning to a period of peace in 1993. The period saw Cambodia\nmaking steady efforts to recover in all aspects of socioeconomic development and to maintain\nsocial, political, and macroeconomic stability. International aid agency operations also resumed\nto assist Cambodia.\n                  \n1\n TA 3467-CAM: Preparing for the Financial Sector Development Program, for $800,000, approved in July 2000. The\nTA commenced implementation in December 2000 and was completed in June 2001. The purpose of the TA was\nto formulate a long-term financial sector development plan and a financial sector program loan as well as to\nconduct the preparatory work for the proposed financial sector program loan.\n2 The Mission comprised Byoung-Jo Chun (Financial Economist, IWFI/Mission Leader); X. Zhang (Economist, IWFI);\nR. O\u2019Sullivan (Counsel, OGC); and P. Long (Program Assistant, CARM). T. Crouch (Manager, IWFI), assisted the\nMission in the field.\n3  The Mission comprised Byoung-Jo Chun (Financial Economist, IWFI/Mission Leader); B. Frielink (Senior Programs\nOfficer, PW3); R. O\u2019Sullivan (Counsel, OGC); X. Zhang (Economist, IWFI); and P. Long (Program Assistant,\nCARM).", "2\n5. The  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  for  1996-2000  (SEDP  I)  marked  the\nGovernment\u2019s  first  systematic  efforts  toward  economic  development  to  achieve  economic\ngrowth and poverty reduction and broad participation in the development process. After the\nsuccessful implementation of SEDP I, the Government is finalizing SEDP II for 2001-2005,\nwhich identifies poverty reduction, as the primary development goal. SEDP II targets reducing\nthe poverty rate from 36 percent4 in 1999 to around 31 percent in 2005, as well as lessening the\ndegree  of  deprivation.  These  will  be  achieved  by  (i)  promoting  broad-based  sustainable\neconomic  growth  at  6-7  percent  with  equitable  income  distribution,  (ii)  social  and  cultural\ndevelopment, and (iii) ensuring sustainable management in the use of natural resources and\nprotecting the environment.\n6. The Government\u2019s strategy to achieve the poverty reduction target is to promote growth\nin all sectors, especially in agriculture because about 90 percent of the poor live in rural areas.\nMobilization and efficient allocation of resources are at the core of the economic development\nstrategy. Specifically, the Government targets the following areas:\n(i)  implementing  fiscal  reforms  and  maintaining  a  stable  macroeconomic\nenvironment;\n(ii)  improving efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector through reforms in the\ncivil service, judiciary, and public enterprises;\n(iii)  enhancing  private  sector  development  while  protecting  public  interest  by  (a)\nimproving  physical  infrastructure,  (b)  developing  the  legal  and  regulatory\nframeworks within which business enterprises operate, (c) liberalizing trade and\ninvestment  policies,  and  (d)  supporting  banking  system  reform  and  financial\nsector development;\n(iv)  promoting agricultural development and creating off-farm employment in both\nrural and urban areas; and\n(v)  empowering the poor to participate in, and thus benefit from, the growth process\nby  improving  their  access  to  nature  assets,  health  and  education  services,\nappropriate technology, and credit; and by removing any anti-poor distortions in\nthe product and factor markets.\nB.  Recent Economic Performance and Prospects\n7. Social  and  political  stability  and  the  Government\u2019s  effort  for  economic  reform  have\nenabled Cambodia to achieve robust economic growth. During 1995-2000, the average annual\ngrowth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) was 4.6 percent, an impressive performance\ncompared with 3 percent growth rate for Southeast Asia over the same period. Although the\nregional financial crisis and domestic political instability caused a substantial slowdown in 1998\nwhen the GDP growth rate plummeted to 1.5 percent, the economy regained momentum in the\nfollowing years. However, an average annual population growth of 2.5 percent has dragged per\ncapita GDP, which stagnates at around $270.\n                  \n4\n The poor are those with a per capita income level below the poverty line of KR54,050 per head per month,\nequivalent to about $14 (less than $0.50 per day).", "3\n8. The agriculture and service sectors dominate Cambodia\u2019s economy, contributing 37.6\npercent and 37.7 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2000. Agriculture in particular absorbs more\nthan 70 percent of employment. On the other hand, the industry sector contributed only 14\npercent of GDP in 1995, but has been the fastest growing sector. Led by manufacturing, the\nindustry sector recorded a strong average growth rate of 14.7 percent per year from 1995 to\n2000. In 2000, the sector contributed 21.7 percent of GDP.\n9. Low  levels  of  savings  and  investments  and  heavy  reliance  on  official  development\nassistance and foreign direct investment have limited the economic growth potential. The gross\ndomestic savings ratio averaged 5.7 percent while the ratio of gross domestic investment to\nGDP  averaged  around  14.6  percent  during  1995-1999,  fluctuating  with  volatile  public\nconfidence. The gap between domestic savings and investments was filled by official transfers,\nwhich averaged 8.4 percent of GDP over the observed period.\n10. SEDP I saw a small surplus in the overall balance of payments due to the improved\ntrade  balance  and  current  account,  although  the  regional  financial  crisis  deteriorated  the\ncountry\u2019s capital account during 1997-1999. The current account deficit declined from 17.3\npercent of GDP in 1996 to 8.6 percent in 2000, with the increase in income receipts and private\ntransfers. In addition, the rapid growth of exports and slower-than-expected growth of imports\ncontributed to an improved trade balance. Exports rose from 6.3 percent of GDP in 1995 to 30.3\npercent in 2000 due to trade reform and concomitant opening of the economy to foreign direct\ninvestment.\n11. Although  the  overall  budget  is  still  in  deficit,  the  Government  improved  fiscal\nmanagement in the SEPD I period, which registered a positive current budget balance in 1997,\n1999, and 2000. With the introduction of the value-added tax in 1999, tax revenue more than\ndoubled from KR446 billion in 1995 to KR1,040 billion in 2000, that is, from 5.9 percent of GDP\nto 8.8 percent of GDP. The structure of expenditures was also rationalized, as more funds were\nallocated to health, education, agriculture, and rural development areas than to defense and\nsecurity.\n12. Expanding economic activities under a stable social and political environment have\nboosted financial transactions and intermediation. M25 increased by 26.9 percent in 2000,\nmainly due to a 41.7 percent increase in foreign currency deposits.6 During the same period,\nbank loans increased 31 percent to an equivalent of $249 million, while deposits increased 40\npercent  to  an  equivalent  of  $382  million.  The  increase  in  the  loan  volume  occurred\npredominantly in the manufacturing and service sectors.\n13. The increased financial intermediation was accompanied by reinforced dollarization of\nthe economy, as the growth of bank deposits was driven by a sharp increase in foreign currency\ndeposits.  Dollarization  delays  the  development  of  effective  monetary  policy  and  limits  the\noutreach of formal financial intermediation into the rural and poor areas where local currency is\nused. Under SEDP II, the Government adopted a policy \u201cto promote the de-dollarization of the\n                  \n5 M2 is a broad monetary aggregate, which consists of currency in circulation, demand deposits, time and savings\ndeposits, and foreign currency deposits in Cambodia.\n6 During the same period, Viet Nam exhibited a similar pattern in trends in monetary aggregate and foreign currency\ndeposits. In 2000, M2 increased by 39 percent and the foreign currency deposits increased by 42.7 percent.", "4\neconomy  through  sustained  macroeconomic  stability  and  financial  sector  reform  with  the\ndevelopment of local currency (Cambodian riel) \u2013 denominated asset markets.\u201d7\n14. Achieving a sustainable high rate of economic growth is crucial to reduce pervasive\npoverty and to absorb the growing labor force with increased labor productivity and real wages.\nThe Government has set a long-term, real annual GDP growth target of 6.0\u20137.0 percent under\nthe assumption that the Government will successfully implement full-scale governance reform\npackages, assisted by ADB and other funding agencies, during the SEDP II period, including\nlegal and judicial, public finance, civil service, and anticorruption measures. If the growth target\nis achieved, implying real annual GDP per capita growth at or above 4.0 percent, then it is\nexpected that Cambodia can achieve a poverty ratio of 31 percent at the end of SEDP II, a 5\npercent point reduction from the level in 1999.8\n15. In the short term, Cambodia is expected to gradually recover with modest economic\ngrowth owing to export growth primarily in the garments sector, continued expansion of tourism,\nand  recovery  in  agriculture  from  the  flood-related  contraction  in  2000.  With  these  factors\nconsidered, it is expected that Cambodia can achieve a 5.0 percent range of economic growth\nin 2001. In the long-term, agricultural productivity must rise above subsistence levels and the\nproportion of the population engaged primarily in agriculture must fall. The most important\nmedium-term constraints to reaching that goal appear to be (i) the inability to mitigate the\ndamages  caused  by  flooding  and  drought,  (ii)  inadequate  natural  resource  management\n(particularly forest and fisheries), and (iii) insecure land rights.9\nIV.  THE SECTOR\nA.  Background, Constraints, and Issues\n1.  Overview\n16. Cambodia\u2019s financial sector is at a rudimentary stage with limited financial intermediation\nand low public confidence. Cambodia still has one of the lowest rates of banking intermediation\nin the world: in 2000, bank loans and deposits accounted for approximately 8 percent and 12\npercent of GDP, respectively.10\n17. In  1989,  Cambodia  started  the  transformation  from  a  mono-banking  system  to  a\ntwo-tiered system. In 1990, treasury operations were transferred to the Ministry of Economy and\nFinance (MEF) and the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) was designated as a ministry and\nused largely to finance budget deficits. In 1996, NBC was established as the central bank with\n                  \n7 The Ministry of Planning, Cambodia. 2001. First Draft of the Second Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan,\n2001-2005. p. 10. De-dollarization needs a comprehensive policy framework to regain public confidence in local\ncurrency, which includes, among others, (i) sustained macroeconomic stability, (ii) provision of local-currency-\ndenominated assets, and (iii) promotion of the money function of local currency. Improved financial intermediation\nwith enhanced public confidence in the financial system would expedite the de-dollarization process. The proposed\nsubprogram, combined with the Government\u2019s efforts in the three strategic areas, will contribute to de-dollarization\nby bolstering public confidence in the financial system.\n8\nThe Ministry of Planning, Cambodia. 2001. First Draft of the Second Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan,\n2001-2005. p. 1.\n9\nCER CAM 2000-14: Country Economic Review, Cambodia, December 2000.\n10\n The levels of bank lending to GDP in Lao PDR and Viet Nam stood at 17 percent and 22 percent, respectively.", "5\nthe promulgation of the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the National Bank of Cambodia\n(the Central Banking Law).\n18. There has been steady progress in the Government\u2019s efforts toward financial sector\ndevelopment  thanks  to  political  stability.  Following  the  establishment  of  NBC  in  1996,  the\nGovernment adopted the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions (the Banking Law) in 1999\nand a new Insurance Law in 2000. Furthermore, from 2000, the Government embarked on a\ncomprehensive bank restructuring program with the assistance of the International Monetary\nFund (IMF), to enhance public confidence in the banking system and strengthen intermediation.\n19. Currently Cambodia has 20 commercial banks as a result of NBC's relicensing program,\nwhich revoked the licenses of 12 nonviable banks. Other operating financial institutions are\ninsurance  companies,  currency  exchange  bureaus,  and  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs).\nBanking  activities  are  scarce  in  the  rural  areas,  where  microfinance  operations  of\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  are  the  main  and  de  facto  providers  of  credit.  The\ninsurance sector is composed of a Government-owned insurance entity, Cambodia National\nInsurance Company (CAMINCO), which acts as regulator, underwriter, and broker; and four\nprivate  insurance  companies  that  are  agents  for  CAMINCO  and  risk  underwriters  through\nfronting  agreements.  There  are  no  recognized  interbank  and  money  markets  and  capital\nmarkets in Cambodia. Development of these markets will depend on such things as proper legal\nand accounting infrastructure, necessary regulatory and institutional structures, and human\nresource capacity.\n20. Weak financial infrastructure hampers the development of the sector. First, Cambodia\nhas yet to develop or strengthen laws pertaining to such things as accounting, insurance,\nnegotiable instruments, secured transactions, commercial enterprises, bankruptcy, contracts,\nand  commercial  credit.  Furthermore,  public  confidence  in  the  legal  and  judicial  system  is\nextremely low. The lack of the rule of law has hampered the development of a formal, contract-\nbased credit culture and thus has been one of the primary impediments to private sector\ndevelopment as well. Second, Cambodia has yet to adopt common accounting and auditing\nstandards. Few companies produce financial statements, and different companies produce\nfinancial  statements  using  different  standards.  Lack  of  common  accounting  standards  and\nenforcement system has not only increased risk and the cost of banking operations, but has\nalso prevented the early development of financial markets.\n2.  The Banking Sector\n21. Background.  To  strengthen  the  banking  system,  NBC  recently  launched  a\ncomprehensive bank re-licensing program based on strengthened capital adequacy requirement\nand CAMELS rating system.11 In November 2000, just before the first phase of NBC's bank\nrelicensing program under IMF support, the commercial banking system consisted of 31 banks:\n2 Government-owned banks, 22 locally incorporated banks, and 7 foreign bank branches. On 8\nDecember 2000, NBC revoked the licenses of 12 banks classified as nonviable, and placed 13\nbanks classified as conditionally viable under memoranda of understanding (MOUs) requiring\ncompliance with restructuring measures and the prudential regulations (i.e., the minimum capital\nrequirement) by the end of 2001.\n                  \n11\nA bank evaluation system is to assess the bank\u2019s soundness in terms of capital adequacy, asset quality,\nmanagement, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to the market.", "6\n22. The five largest commercial banks, including the Government-owned Foreign Trade\nBank (FTB), hold more than 50 percent of total banking assets and deposits. Deposits in foreign\ncurrencies, predominantly US dollars, comprise 93 percent of total banking deposits. The US\ndollar is the primary medium of exchange with the Cambodian riel, which is used primarily in\nrural areas. The formal banking sector is concentrated in Phnom Penh, although 84 percent of\nthe population resides in rural areas.\n23. As of December 2000, the total assets of the banking system stood at KR2,517 billion\n($644 million) or 20 percent of GDP. This represents an increase of 20 percent since the end of\n1999. During the same period, loans increased 31 percent to an equivalent of $249 million,\nwhile deposits increased 40 percent to an equivalent of $382 million. Loan growth has occurred\npredominantly in the manufacturing and service sectors.\n24. Despite the low level of lending, asset quality in the banking system is poor. According to\nNBC, the volume of nonperforming loans in the banking system is substantial and growing. Lack\nof common accounting standards and a uniform chart of bank accounts compounds concern\nabout the accuracy of the reported nonperforming loans. The banking system provides a narrow\nrange of financial instruments usually limited to demand, saving, and time deposits on the\nliability side. Loan portfolios tend to be confined to a narrow range of better-known firms.\nMoreover, most banks maintain a high level of liquidity with the percentage of cash to total\nassets at roughly 19 percent, and approximately 33 percent of total assets of the whole banking\nsystem appear to be nonearning assets.\n25. High risks and operating costs associated with bank lending are reflected in both high\ninterest rate spread and short-term lending. The spread between loan and deposit interest rates\nis estimated at 10 to 13 percentage points, as loan interest rates are around 20 percent per\nannum or higher. Typical loan maturity is three to six months. Term finance is unavailable, and\nbanks  are  reluctant  to  provide  loans  with  terms  of  one  year  or  longer.  To  overcome  this\nproblem, the usual practice is to continue rolling over short-term loans.\n26. Constraints  and  Issues.  A  number  of  factors  contribute  to  the  low  level  of\nintermediation, poor asset quality, and high operating costs of banks, which lead to poor public\nconfidence  and  limited  deposit  mobilization.  First,  uncertainties  regarding  enforceability  of\nsecurity interests impede bank lending and contribute to poor asset quality. The collateral\nregistration system is rudimentary and unreliable due to the absence of laws and regulations\ngoverning  secured  transactions  as  well  as  an  inadequate  public  registration  system  that\nspecifies  lenders\u2019  positions  and  priority  rankings  in  secured  property.  The  system  is\ncumbersome, as it forces banks and other concerned parties to go through several steps to\nidentify, confirm, and register secured interest. In addition, lack of a proper collateral valuation\nsystem inhibits sound lending.\n27. Second, lack of a reliable borrower information system impedes bank lending and leads\nto poor asset quality as well. Cambodia lacks a credit bureau or an arrangement for banks to\nshare  credit  information.  Further,  few  firms  produce  financial  statements  and  no  common\naccounting standards are enforced. Thus, banks are unable to lend based on cash-flow analysis\ndue to lack of clients\u2019 financial information. Consequently, they are compelled to lend against\ncollateral as the primary source of repayment, which is further compromised by the lack of\ninfrastructure for secured transactions.\n28. Third,  rudimentary  liquidity  management  mechanisms  cause  substantial  opportunity\nlosses to banks, increasing their operating costs. Except for occasional exchange of interbank", "7\ndeposits among a few banks, there are no formal interbank market arrangements where banks\ncan borrow or lend to manage liquidity. Thus, most banks maintain abnormally high levels of\nliquidity.  Lack  of  interbank  markets  stems  from,  among  others,  the  absence  of  mutual\nconfidence among banks. In addition, although the Central Banking Law provides a legal basis\nfor rediscount facilities,12 NBC is unable to provide liquidity service to commercial banks to meet\ntemporary liquidity shortages, because no eligible negotiable instruments (i.e., bills of exchange,\npromissory notes, etc.) are available due to lack of the necessary legal infrastructure (i.e.,\nnegotiable instruments law).\n29. Fourth,  weak  supervisory  capacity  and  a  regulatory  framework  impedes  early\nidentification of banking problems, as well as the timely and orderly resolution of problem banks.\nPublic  confidence  has  been  undermined  mainly  because  the  supervisory  system  failed  to\nconvince the public that all banks are under the oversight of the supervisory authorities, due to\nthe  apparent  lack  of  systematic  supervision  and  prudential  regulations.  In  fact,  the  basic\nframework and capacity for on- and off-site supervision, as well as a prompt corrective action\nsystem are yet to be in place. Weak capacity and shortcomings in the legal and regulatory\nframework for bank liquidation have hampered and delayed early and orderly liquidation of\ndelicensed banks. Both the existing bank regulations and the capacity of the Bank Supervision\nDepartment (BSD) of NBC need strengthening. In addition, the current system lacks a requisite\nbasis for effective bank supervision and prudential regulations, such as a uniform chart of bank\naccounts  and  disclosure  rules.  Like  their  borrowers,  commercial  banks  adopt  different\naccounting standards. Furthermore, a review of sample financial statements of commercial\nbanks  revealed  inconsistency  in  the  quality  of  the  audits  performed  by  international  firms\npartially due to the lack of common accounting and auditing standards in Cambodia.\n30. Finally, the banking system suffers from scarce human resource and capacity. Capacity\ngap  in  the  public  sector  is  one  of  the  most  acute  problems  hampering  banking  sector\ndevelopment.  The  bank  supervisory  authority  especially  needs  substantial  capacity  and\ninstitution building to properly discharge its responsibilities. The private sector also requires\nsubstantial capacity building. The Government\u2019s proactive market opening policy in the early\nstage of financial sector development has enabled Cambodia to attract many experienced\nforeign commercial bankers into the banking sector. As a result, most of the senior managers\nare  experienced  and  competent  bankers.  However,  most  banks  have  difficulty  in  finding\nqualified working-level staff due to the legacy of long-standing domestic strife and international\nisolation. Thus, most working-level staff need substantial professional training in basic banking\noperations such as credit analysis, loan monitoring, and problem loan management.\n3.  Rural Finance\n31. Background. The rudimentary banking system and its urban bias neither addresses the\ndemand from the poor for microfinance to smoothen consumption, build assets, and develop\nmicroenterprises; nor is it structured to meet the demand from the middle and upper segments\nof the rural markets for financing commercial cultivation, agricultural-trading, and rural and\nagriculture related enterprises (e.g., rice milling and dairy).\n                  \n12\n\u201dThe Central Bank shall determine the procedures or repurchase from, sell to, discount and rediscount for banks\nand financial institutions: (a) bills of exchange and promissory notes drawn or made for bona fide commercial,\nindustrial, or agricultural purposes, bearing two or more good signatures one of which must be that of a commercial\nbank and maturing within 90 days from the date of their acquisition by the Central Bank\u2026; and (c) any private\nnegotiable claims on the money market as well as all bankers claims bearing creditworthy signature and appearing\non a list recognized by the Board,\u201d Article 36, the Central Banking Law.", "8\n32. Nearly 40 percent of the population has no access to formal bank branches. Only 6\npercent of the total banking sector advances is for agriculture or related activities, primarily\nshort-term, dollar-denominated loans. The estimated rural finance demand of $120 million-$130\nmillion per annum, of which one third is for microcredit loans ranging from $50 to $300, is only\nfractionally met from institutional sources. Reliable savings facilities are generally not available\nin rural areas and to the poor.\n33. Currently, about 90 NGOs supported by funding agencies provide microfinance to nearly\n270,000 poor households, or 15 percent of the total. Most of the borrowers are women. The\nestimated aggregate outstanding microcredit is $17 million and savings mobilized amount to $1\nmillion. Service delivery is through \u201cvillage banks\u201d comprising 100-200 members and managed\nby a village credit committee. Members are organized into groups, provided some basic training\nand individual credit with group liability. Loans varying from $50 to $300 are provided for 3-12\nmonths, with equal installments and incentives for timely repayment. Interest rates on loans are\n3.0\u20135.0 percent per month. Repayment rates are 80-95 percent. The balance of microfinance\nsupply is from informal sources either based on reciprocity and social obligations or from\nmoney-lenders and input suppliers.\n34. Cognizant of the issues, the Government adopted a rural credit policy with the aim to\ndevelop an effective rural financial system. It has initiated the following measures under the\nongoing ADB-funded Rural Credit and Savings Project (RCSP) 13 and TA for Rural Financial\nServices: (i) introducing an enabling provision in the Banking Law for eligible NGOs and other\nrural finance service providers to become regulated licensed MFIs; (ii) creating a microfinance\nsupervision department within NBC to undertake off-site and on-site supervision of licensed\nMFIs, and to monitor the financial activities of NGOs; (iii) establishing the Rural Development\nBank (RDB) as an apex institution to provide financing for MFIs and commercial banks, and to\nextend technical support and training for MFIs; and (iv) enhancing collaboration between the\nGovernment, NBC, and NGOs in promoting sustainable rural finance. The Government intends\nto actively encourage the entry of commercial banks in rural finance, strengthen NBC\u2019s capacity\nto ensure orderly development of the sector, and make RDB a sustainable apex institution.\n35. Constraints and Issues. While many factors contribute to poverty, its most obvious\nmanifestation is insufficient household income, lack of productive assets, and inaccessibility of\naffordable financial services. The Government has prioritized the development of a policy and\ninstitutional framework for rural finance.\n36. The demand and supply gap for institutional rural finance even at the current level of\neconomic activities is significant. Demand for savings, though not quantified, is significant and\nlargely unmet due to the absence of (i) reliable savings facilities, (ii) appropriate products, (iii)\nhigh  cost  of  service  delivery,  (iv)  inaccessibility,  and  (v)  relative  inexperience  of  NGOs  in\nmanaging savings. The supply side is dominated by microcredit characterized by short-term\nloans. The supply of term credit for agriculture and rural sectors is seriously constrained by lack\nof institutions capable of delivering and managing term credit, and lack of long-term funds. The\nlatter undermines the efforts of agricultural diversification and export promotion. Weak contract\nenforcement also deters term financing. The network, orientation, institutional capability, and\nfinancial health of commercial banks combine to make them only marginal suppliers of short-\nterm rural finance.\n                  \n13\nLoan 1741-CAM: Rural Credit and Savings Project, for $20 million, approved on 20 April 2000.", "9\n37. The majority of the NGOs, the sole as well as de facto suppliers of microfinance in rural\nareas,  exhibit  (i)  a  poorly  motivated  part-time  volunteer  workforce;  (ii)  weak  systems  and\nprocedures; (iii) reliance on Government and external assistance; (iv) lack of commitment to\nsustainability; and (v) little, if any, realization of the need to specialize for efficient delivery of\nfinancial services.\n4.  The Insurance Sector\n38. Background. Although the insurance sector is still at its nascent stage, there will be\nsubstantial potential for growth once adequate legal and regulatory infrastructure is put in place.\nFor  example,  legislative  actions  to  require  a  third-party-liability  motor  insurance  and  life\ninsurance  would  create  substantial  demand  for  insurance  to  comply  with  the  laws  and\nregulations. The insurance sector plays an important role in mobilizing long-term domestic\nresources, complementing the intermediation role of the banking sector, even in the early stage\nof financial sector development as demonstrated in many developing countries.\n39. The insurance sector consists of the Government-owned insurance entity CAMINCO,\nwhich acts as regulator and underwriter, and four private insurance companies that act as\nagents  for  CAMINCO.  As  part  of  the  current  restructuring  and  corporatization  program,\nCAMINCO will be transformed into a private company through joint venture with one of the\nprivate insurance companies. The Government is expected to sign up a joint-venture agreement\nwith the candidate company soon, in which MEF will still hold the lion\u2019s share.\n40. Most  policy  purchasers  in  Cambodia  are  foreign  investors  and  international\norganizations. And the main sources of business include property, health, marine cargo, and\nmotor vehicles. CAMINCO has also made reinsurance arrangements with foreign partners in the\nregion and European countries. Other products expected in the future are livestock insurance,\ncrop insurance, and life insurance.\n41. The year 2000 was a watershed period in insurance sector development. The National\nAssembly adopted a long-awaited Insurance Law in July 2000, and the Government committed\nitself to gradual commercialization and privatization of CAMINCO. The new Insurance Law\ncovers: general provisions; property insurance, life, and personal insurance; compulsory third-\nparty-liability motor insurance; construction insurance and insurance for passenger transport;\ninsurance company and state control; insurance agents and brokers; and legal penalties. The\nGovernment is now drafting a subdecree that will flesh out detailed prudential regulations and\nprocedures to implement the law. The first draft was submitted to the Council of Ministers for\napproval in March 2001, and is expected to be effective this year.\n42. As  part  of  the  commercialization/privatization  effort  of  CAMINCO,  its  regulatory\nresponsibility was transferred to the Insurance Office that was established under the Financial\nIndustry  Department  of  MEF  in  March  2001.  Key  officials  in  the  Insurance  Office  were\ntransferred from the supervisory unit of CAMINCO. The Government also nominated the former\npresident of CAMINCO as the Insurance Commissioner.\n43. Constraints  and  Issues.  The  insurance  sector  has  been  constrained  by  weak\nsupervisory and regulatory framework and capacity, let alone low income and lack of public\nawareness of the insurance sector. Although the Government adopted the Insurance Law in\n2000, it has yet to adopt a subdecree implementing the law and basic prudential regulations on\nsuch things as uniform chart of accounts, disclosure rules, investment guidelines, and solvency\nrequirements.", "10\n44. Second, an effective enforcement and monitoring mechanism to implement compulsory\ninsurance  needs  to  be  established.  While  the  introduction  of  compulsory  insurance  in  the\nInsurance Law (i.e., compulsory third-party-liability motor insurance, construction insurance, and\ninsurance  for  passenger  transport)  was  hailed  as  a  breakthrough  by  the  private  sector,\ncompulsory insurance cannot be fully implemented by a framework law alone. Implementation\ncritically relies on a well-organized enforcement and monitoring system that is supported by a\ncouple of supporting laws that require the purchase of compulsory insurance policy. This, in\nturn, requires interministerial efforts and coordination.\n45. Third, the framework for private sector development in the insurance sector needs to be\nstrengthened. The introduction of compulsory insurance is expected to create a policy-driven\ndemand for insurance. However, without a framework that fosters fair competition between\nstate-owned and private companies, and between incumbent and prospective companies, the\ncompulsory insurance market will be susceptible to distortions in pricing and quality of services,\nwhich will in turn undermine public confidence in compulsory insurance. The Government has\nalready  taken  an  important  initiative  toward  private  sector  development  by  adopting  a\nprivatization policy for CAMINCO. However, a couple of issues remain to be addressed. The\nGovernment should exert efforts to divest its ownership in the insurance sector. Since MEF is\nnow responsible for insurance supervision, the Government\u2019s holding the lion\u2019s share in the\nlargest  insurance  company  will  not  only  pose  conflict  of  interest  in  supervision,  but  also\nundermine fair competition. Thus, the partial privatization of CAMINCO through joint venture\nshould be ultimately linked to divestiture of the Government shares in the joint venture in the\nmedium-term. Secondly, the Government needs to develop a transparent entry mechanism, to\nfoster competition by giving equal opportunities to both state-owned and private companies.\n46. Finally, the new insurance supervisor needs substantial capacity building. MEF has\nsuccessfully  retained  experienced  regulators  from  CAMINCO,  but  additional  staff  and\nsubstantial capacity building are still needed to help them discharge responsibilities anticipated\nunder the Insurance Law, as well as to undertake the development role in the insurance sector.\nRecently, the authorities sought international cooperation, such as from the Malaysia Insurance\nInstitute,  in  training  the  current  supervisory  staff  and  establishing  an  insurance  training\ninstitution in Cambodia over the medium term. Capacity building must target the key staff in the\nInsurance Office of MEF, as well as those in the line ministries, which will be involved in\nenforcing and monitoring for compulsory insurance.\n5.  Interbank and Money Markets\n47. Background.  There  are  no  recognized  interbank  and  money  markets  operating  in\nCambodia other than intermittent occasional exchange of deposits among a few banks who\ntrust each other. The lack of interbank markets increases banking operating costs. Since there\nis no way to manage liquidity, most banks are forced to maintain a high level of non-earning\nassets, incurring opportunity costs. The percentage of cash to total assets amounts to roughly\n19 percent, and 33 percent of total assets are nonearning assets.\n48. Constraints and Issues. Several factors hinder the establishment of interbank/money\nmarkets  in  Cambodia.  First,  lack  of  mutual  confidence  among  commercial  banks  hinders\ninterbank market service. There must be a forum to build mutual confidence among banks and\nto discuss a common policy agenda. To begin with, commercial banks need to work together to\nestablish an inclusive bankers association and obtain official recognition from the authorities.\nSecond,  lack of a legal basis for money market instruments also hinders the development of", "11\ninterbank markets. To improve the current situation, establishing a legal basis for negotiable\ninstruments must be a prime consideration in legislation.\n6.  Capital Markets\n49. Background.  Under  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  initiative,  the  Government  has  made\nconsiderable efforts to lay the foundation for capital market development. The Government\ndrafted a capital market law in 1995; unfortunately, this initiative was interrupted due to the\npolitical disturbance in 1997. Even after 1997, little progress was made owing to the delay in\ndeveloping the requisite financial and legal infrastructure.\n50. With  progress  in  the  governance  reform  assisted  by  ADB  and  World  Bank,  the\nGovernment  is  now  renewing  its  efforts  for  capital  market  development.  For  instance,  the\nGovernment has established a capital market unit in MEF. The Government is also drafting a\nsubdecree to create an independent securities supervisory body responsible for attending to all\nof the functions of capital markets and bringing about its full operation.\n51. On the other hand, the Central Banking Law (1996) assigns to NBC the responsibility for\nestablishing  and  overseeing  financial  markets.  According  to  the  law,  NBC  has  duties  and\nfunctions in forming and supervising the money and financial markets. In addition, the Central\nBanking Law empowers NBC to conduct securities operations to facilitate the registration,\ndistribution and trade of securities issued by the Government (Title VI, Article 23). NBC will have\nto delegate these powers to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) once the latter is\ncreated.\n52. Constraints and Issues. Capital markets cannot go forward until proper accounting,\nlegal, and other financial infrastructure are in place and the legal and accounting professions\nare organized and operational. Not only is it necessary to draft and pass the key laws currently\nunder  preparation;  the  implementing  institutions  must  be  formed  and  developed.  More\nimportantly, there must be a critical mass of potential listing companies who are willing to accept\nhigher  standards  of  corporate  governance  and  capable  of  producing  audited  financial\nstatements. Thus, the Government needs to conduct a feasibility study to assess a critical mass\nof issuers in line with the promulgation of the law on commercial enterprises.\n7.  Legal Infrastructure\n53. Background. Financial sector development depends on an adequate body of laws that\ninclude such things as contracts, bankruptcy, collateral, and loan recovery. To enforce these\nlaws, a body of ethical and professional lawyers and judges, and a reliable and efficient court\nsystem whose decisions are enforceable must be in place.\n54. A civil code and procedures are currently being drafted with assistance from Japan\nInternational  Cooperation  Agency.  These  laws  will  provide  a  legal  basis  from  which\nstakeholders in the financial sector will obtain their rights and liabilities and their causes of\naction. The civil code should be drafted to ensure certainty in basic contract law principles,\nincluding rights attached to securities and rules governing the transfer of those rights. Because\nthese  laws  are  yet  to  be  in  place  in  Cambodia,  specific  legislation  can  supplement  the\ndeficiency.\n55. The Ministry of Commerce (MOC) has submitted to the Council of Ministers a draft law\non commercial enterprises that is being debated and is expected to be submitted to the National", "12\nAssembly this year. It is expected that the National Assembly will adopt the law by mid-2002. In\nMay 2000, Cambodia ratified adherence to the New York Convention on commercial arbitration,\nand is now drafting a commercial arbitration procedure. MOC is also drafting a bankruptcy law\nand a secured transactions law.\n56. The  Government  is  moving  forward  with  judiciary  reform  as  an  integral  part  of\ngovernance  reform.  The  Government  has  adopted  the  Governance  Action  Plan,  which\nunderscores  the  importance  of  human  resource  development,  court  inspection,  and\ninfrastructure. Moreover, the Ministry of Justice has drafted a law on the organization and\nfunction of a court system, which includes establishing a commercial chamber and four other\nchambers in the district court. The Council of Ministers is currently reviewing the draft.\n57. Constraints  and  Issues.  The  Government  needs  to  exert  efforts  to  prioritize  the\nadoption of necessary laws that it can expedite the legislation process. With regard to financial\nsector  development,  laws  pertaining  to  commercial  transactions  including  accounting,\nnegotiable  instruments,  secured  transactions,  commercial  enterprises,  bankruptcy,  and\ncontracts must have first priority. The law on corporate accounts, their audit, and the accounting\nprofession  (accounting  and  auditing  law)  and  law  on  commercial  enterprises  must  be\nestablished to lay the foundation for capital market development. Afterwards the Government\nmay proceed to adopt a securities and exchange law (or redraft the capital market law).14 In line\nwith the adoption of the law on commercial enterprises, a bankruptcy law must be adopted,\nparticularly to bolster the liquidation of banks delicensed on 8 December 2000. In addition, a\nsecured  transactions  law  and  negotiable  instruments  law  must  be  established  to  underpin\nbanking and commercial activities.\n58. The establishment of a law enforcement mechanism should also be addressed in a\nsystematic way. Most importantly, the Government should move forward with the judicial reform\naddressed in the Governance Action Plan. With regard to financial sector development, the\nGovernment should also draft a plan to establish a public registration system for secured\ntransactions  and  make  efforts  to  maintain  public  confidence  in  such  an  enforcement\nmechanism.\n8.  Accounting and Auditing System\n59. Background. Cambodia has yet to adopt common accounting and auditing standards\nand to establish an enforcement mechanism. MEF's Commission for Accounting Reform has\nendorsed the adoption of International Accounting Standards (IAS)/International Standards on\nAuditing (ISA) as core principles of accounting standards, and has submitted a draft accounting\nand auditing law to the Council of Ministers for consideration.\n60. Currently, the local offices of two international accounting firms and several local firms\nundertake most of the auditing services in Cambodia. The international firms together employ a\nstaff of approximately 125 and serve about 400 clients, of which 30-40 percent are private\nsector  companies.  Many  private  sector  companies  are  the  local  affiliates  of  international\n                  \n14\nSuch recommendation on the sequence of legislation is also supported by a previous ADB study on Cambodia\u2019s\nfinancial management and governance issues. The study suggests that \u201cThe current draft Capital Market Law and\nthe draft Law on Commercial Enterprises be reviewed and replaced by a comprehensive Law on companies and,\nat the appropriate time, a further law be drafted regarding the establishment of a Securities and Exchange\nCommission and a Stock Exchange.\u201d See Narayan, F. B., and T. Gordon, 2000. Financial Management and\nGovernance Issues in Cambodia: Diagnostic Study of Accounting and Auditing. Manila: Asian Development Bank.", "13\ncompanies  and  the  audited  information  is  sent  to  the  home  office  for  inclusion  in  the\nconsolidated  accounts.  At  present  most  senior  accountants  and  all  the  managers  are\nexpatriates. Both international firms have looked into certification of Cambodian staff using\nprograms from the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants. Although the inspections\nmay be taken locally, this program is very expensive as the training courses are offered in Viet\nNam. The demand for trained auditors is expanding rapidly and will increase dramatically once\nan accounting and auditing law and common standards are established.\n61. NBC has a broad legal mandate to regulate nearly all issues related to accounting and\nauditing of banks. This goes beyond the usual prudential regulations to include establishing the\nrules for measurement, recognition, and disclosure in the financial statements and consolidation\nof  accounts.  The  Central  Banking  Law  also  permits  NBC  to  establish  the  banking  sector\naccounting standards separate from the tax regulations. NBC has drafted a uniform chart of\naccounts for banks. Most of the accounting policies are taken verbatim from the \u201cFramework for\nthe Preparation and Development of Financial Statements\u201d published in July 1989. However,\nthere are some substantive changes so that the resulting financial statements will not be in\naccordance with IAS.\n62. Constraints and Issues. Given the importance of the accounting and auditing system in\nCambodia, the Government needs to expedite the promulgation of the accounting and auditing\nlaw and the adoption of common accounting and auditing standards.15 While the Government\nhas  already  committed  to  adopt  IAS/ISA  in  their  entirety,  it  should  carefully  work  out  an\nimplementation plan to phase in IAS/ISA, considering the limited capacity and compliance cost\nof the private sector.\n63. The Government should play a pivotal role in establishing an enforcement system for\naccounting and auditing standards. Upon adoption of the accounting and auditing law, the\nGovernment  should  establish  an  accounting  standards  authority  as  well  as  a  professional\nassociation  of  accountants  and  auditors.  An  association  serves  a  number  of  important\nregulatory functions in the public interest. In the early stages of development, an association\ncan provide a forum for practitioners to communicate with the Government and educational\ninstitutions. An association can also play a role in communicating best practices to members\nand thus help to reduce the cost of training staff members by combining the resources of\nmember  firms.  A  more  mature  association  can  assume  regulatory  functions,  including\ncertification of new auditors and enforcement of a code of ethics, and may offer continuing\neducation programs. The draft accounting and auditing law included provisions for creating a\nnational accounting council and an institute of Khmer auditors and accountants under the aegis\nof MEF. The international best practice for such organizations is that they be private sector\nentities. However, regardless of how responsibilities are divided, there is an urgent need for\nestablishing such an association.\n9.  Human Resource Development\n64. Background. Lack of human resource capacity is a major impediment to financial sector\ndevelopment in Cambodia. There is great need for formal training in core skills (e.g., banking,\n                  \n15\nThe rationale for adoption of international standards is that, first, it is time-consuming and expensive to develop\nnational standards; second, it is also time-consuming for users to learn national standards in addition to IAS. Even\nthe largest economies today are moving toward adoption of IAS.", "14\naccounting, statistical analysis, and general management) and specialized competencies for the\neffective operation of a market-driven economy in both public and private sectors.\n65. A number of institutions and organizations play a role in developing of human resources\nfor  the  financial  sector  in  Cambodia.  They  include  universities  and  business  schools,\ncommercial banks, bankers associations, the Centre for Banking Studies (CBS) under NBC,\nand MEF. Each commercial bank operating in Cambodia assumes individual responsibility for\nits internal training program. The commitment of resources to training differs from bank to bank.\nForeign  commercial  banks  normally  send  their  employees  for  training  overseas.  Capacity\nbuilding activities for NBC are primarily undertaken by CBS. CBS was established in 1995 for\nNBC staff; since 1996, it has been transformed into a broader training facility for both NBC and\noutsiders (high school graduates). CBS currently offers a 2.5 years (5 semesters) associate\u2019s\ndegree program, recognized by the Ministry of Education. As of July 2000, CBS has graduated\n443.\n66. Constraints and Issues. While CBS has contributed initially to filling the capacity gap in\nthe early stage of banking development, the scope and quality of training services are not\nenough to meet the needs of the private sector and so it remains a training school for entry-level\nNBC employees. At this time, all CBS instructors are working part-time and salary payments are\nstill largely based on academic degrees rather than teaching ability. CBS instructors receive\nhourly compensation, considerably less than that typically paid by the business universities.\nTherefore, CBS has been unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified instructors.\n67. Commercial banks will continue to send their employees outside of Cambodia at high\ncost until adequate training is available in the country. Many commercial banks have indicated\nthe need for a professional training program in Phnom Penh; they further indicated, however,\nthat they will only send their employees to training that is practical and relevant, and taught by\nexperienced bankers. One reason for the absence of professional training is the difficulty of\nhiring qualified instructors with the practical commercial banking experience necessary to teach\ncourses  such  as  credit  analysis,  letters  of  credit,  foreign  exchange,  bank  operations,  and\nassets/liabilities management.\n68. A  bankers  association  is  the  logical  home  for  a  professional  training  program  for\nbankers.  By  pooling  their  resources  and  using  experienced  commercial  bankers  to  teach\ntraining programs, a bankers association can be an effective means for providing training to the\ncommercial  banking  sector.  Upon  creation  of  a  comprehensive  bankers  association,  the\nassociation should first establish a professional training program. The training program should\nalso be open to staff of MFIs.\nB.  Government Objectives and Strategy\n69. ADB has supported the Government in developing its long-term vision and development\nstrategy and plan for the financial sector. The objective of the long-term development plan is to\ndevelop a sound, market-based financial system that is competitive, integrated, and efficient.\nThe long-term vision is that the financial sector will double in size relative to GDP in 10 years.\nThe vision will be achieved by ensuring the following:\n(i)  a  competitive,  safe,  and  sound  banking  system  that  is  well  regulated  and\nsupervised and effectively mobilizes savings to provide financing to support the\ngrowth of the private sector;", "15\n(ii)  the establishment and development of nonbank financial institutions that increase\nthe depth of the financial sector by providing a broad array of diversified services\nincluding leasing and consumer finance;\n(iii)  an insurance sector that protects businesses and individuals from catastrophic\nevents and a pension system that provides a secure retirement, both of which\nprovide capital for long-term investment in the real sector;\n(iv)  a safe and reliable system for the transfer of funds between customers and\nbanks and the settlement of payments between banks;\n(v)  money markets that facilitate interbank markets that provide banks, companies,\nand individuals with the means for effectively managing liquidity;\n(vi)  efficient  and  transparent  capital  markets  with  a  critical  mass  of  issuers  that\nmobilizes funds for long-term investment;\n(vii)  a legal system that promotes and enforces the rule of law in commercial and\nfinancial  transactions  and  that  supports  good  governance  by  promoting\ntransparency, accountability, participation, and predictability;\n(viii)  an  accounting  and  auditing  system  based  on  international  standards  that\nsupports  good  governance  by  promoting  transparency,  accountability,\nparticipation, and predictability; and\n(ix)  human resource development based on performance-based compensation and\npromotion, and the availability of a broad range of professional programs that\nretrain existing staff and provide ongoing training.\n70. To achieve the long-term vision, the Government has adopted a long-term strategy for\nthe financial sector to\n(i)  maintain sound fiscal and monetary policies to ensure macroeconomic stability;\n(ii)  establish systematically a sound legal framework to protect property rights and\nenforce contracts;\n(iii)  establish the rule of law through legal/judicial reform and law enforcement to\nunderpin financial and commercial activities;\n(iv)  sequence  efforts  to  develop  financial  infrastructure,  particularly  a\npayment/clearing  system,  accounting  and  auditing  system,  credit  information\nsystem, and regulatory framework;\n(v)  structure the regulatory and policy framework to foster competition in the financial\nmarkets and to encourage financial institutions to realize economies of scale and\nscope;\n(vi)  establish a regulatory and institutional framework to promote sound governance\nprinciples  and  to  allow  market  discipline  to  work  in  the  management  and\noperations of financial institutions;", "16\n(vii)  establish  a  sound  framework  for  private  sector  development  in  the  financial\nsystem by phasing out state ownership and state intervention in the system;\n(viii)  develop a transparent entry framework to encourage allocation efficiency and\nfinancial deepening;\n(ix)  develop an efficient exit mechanism for troubled institutions (such as liquidation,\nmerger  and  acquisition)  to  foster  continuous  reorganization  in  the  financial\nsystem without incurring social costs; and\n(x)  develop  human  and  institutional  capacity  in  both  private  and  public  sectors\nthrough a public-private sector partnership.\n71. Under  the  long-term  strategy,  the  Government  has  adopted  the  long-term  financial\nsector development plan, or the Financial Sector Development Blueprint as its official financial\nsector  development  plan.  The  FSPL  is  a  critical  component  to  support  the  Government\u2019s\nimplementation of Phase I of the Blueprint.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n72. In addition to ADB, IMF has been a major contributor to Cambodia\u2019s financial sector\ndevelopment. Since 1994, IMF has provided support to develop Cambodia\u2019s monetary policy\nand central bank operations. In October 1999, IMF approved the Poverty Reduction and Growth\nFacility (PRGF) for Cambodia for SDR58.5 million (equivalent to $81.6 million) to support the\nGovernment\u2019s economic program for 1999-2002. The reform agenda under the PRGF includes\n(i)  avoiding central bank financing of the budget (1999-2002);\n(ii)  completing on-site inspection for all private banks (1999);\n(iii)  improving supervision capacity, including strengthening staff capacity and setting\nsupervision guidelines (1999-2002);\n(iv)  strengthening the legal framework by adopting a new law on commercial banks\nand financial institutions (November 1999);\n(v)  relicensing all existing commercial banks under the new Banking Law and close\ndown those that do not comply with the law (2000-2002); and\n(vi)  restructuring the FTB (1999-2001).\n73. IMF\u2019s recent review mission noted Cambodia\u2019s \u201cstrong\u201d performance reflected in \u201ca\nresumption of growth, low inflation, and significant progress in major areas of structure reform,\u201d\nand supported the tranche release of the PRGF.16 In banking reform, it noted NBC\u2019s action in\nclosing nonviable banks, and emphasized the importance of closely monitoring the conditionally\nviable banks, which are under restructuring MOU. It also urged the Government\u2019s \u201ctimely action\nwhen those MOU banks do not meet the requirements.\u201d\n                  \n16\nIMF. 2001. Cambodia: Second Review Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.", "17\n74. The World Bank has been assisting in drafting an accounting and auditing law. Together\nwith ADB,17 the World Bank also assists the Government in adopting IAS/ISA and establishing\nenforcement  mechanisms  such  as  an  accounting  and  auditing  standard  board  and  an\naccounting professional association. In addition, based on ADB\u2019s seminal work in governance\nreform,18 the World Bank joined ADB and the United Nations Development Programme to help\nthe Government in adopting the Governance Action Plan.\n75. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is assisting Cambodia in financial sector\ndevelopment through TA and the Mekong Project Development Facility (MPDF). One TA was\nlaunched in February 2001 to help the Government formulate the restructuring and privatization\nplan for FTB. The TA focuses on advising the Government on the approach to restructuring and\nprivatization without getting involved in the actual process. Another TA under consideration\nintends to assist in training future capital market regulators in anticipation of the establishment\nof a SEC and securities exchange in the near future. MPDF, an IFC facility, is to assist and\naccelerate the development of productive, self-sustaining small- and medium-sized enterprises\n(SME) in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Viet Nam. MPDF is\nalso charged with improving the enabling environment for SME development. The principal\nactivities of MPDF cover two areas: investment evaluation and preparation, and in-country\ndevelopment program. Specifically, it facilitates bank lending to SMEs through bank training,\ndeveloping the bankers association, and a TA to one of the leading local commercial banks. In\naddition, MPDF aims at developing new forms of financing, such as trade financing facilities,\nleasing, and venture capital.\nD.  ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n76. ADB\u2019s country operational strategy specifies three priority areas: (i) support for pro-poor,\nsustainable economic growth through interventions to relieve key constraints to broad-based\nagricultural growth; (ii) a focus on human resource development; and (iii) development of an\nenabling environment for the private sector through selected interventions in transportation,\nfinance, and energy.\n77. ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  finance  and  industry  sector  consists  of  four  advisory  TA\n(ADTAs) and one project preparatory TA (PPTA): (i) Cambodia Development Bank ($31,000),\napproved in January 1973; (ii) Institutional Strengthening of the CBS and State-Owned Banks\u2019\nStaff Training ($340,000), approved in May 1995; (iii) Strengthening Capacity in the Trade and\nIndustry Sectors ($600,000), approved in May 1996; (iv) Enhancing Banking Skills ($400,000),\napproved in May 1997; and (v) PPTA for the FSPL ($800,000), approved in July 2000. In the\nrural finance sector, a PPTA on Rural Credit & Savings ($600,000) was approved in June 1997.\nADB launched a $20 million Rural Credit and Savings Project Loan in April 2000. For SME\ndevelopment, ADB is supporting MPDF under a regional TA for Small- and Medium-Sized\nEnterprises Growth and Development in the Mekong Region ($750,000), approved in November\n2000; and approved an equity investment of $5 million in the Mekong Enterprises Fund in\nAugust 2000.\n                  \n17\nADB has provided a comprehensive diagnostic study of accounting and auditing to help develop an accounting and\nauditing standards and enforcement mechanism consistent with international standards. See Narayan, F. B., and\nT. Gordon, 2000. Financial Management and Governance Issues in Cambodia: Diagnostic Study of Accounting\nand Auditing. Manila: Asian Development Bank.\n18\nKato, T., J. A. Kaplan, Chan Sophal, and Real Sopheap. 2000. Cambodia: Enhancing Governance for Sustainable\nDevelopment. Manila: Asian Development Bank.", "18\n78. ADB undertook a financial sector strategy study in 1999 that produced a preliminary\nroad map for financial sector development over the next 20 years. Based on the preliminary\nroad  map,  ADB  provided  a  PPTA  for  preparing  a  financial  sector  development  program,\ncompleted the in-depth diagnostic review of constraints to the financial sector, and produced a\nlong-term financial sector vision and three-stage sector development plan, or the Financial\nSector Blueprint for 2001-2010.\n79. The Blueprint comprises a long-term development strategy and subsector development\nplan. The long-term strategy is developed based on key lessons from the experiences of\nfinancial sector development and reform in Asia and other transition economies. The long-term\nobjective is to guide the subsector development strategy. Each subsector development plan\nconsists of a development goal, intermediate reform agenda, and illustrative policy measures in\neach phase. The development goal describes the subsector strategy to achieve visions in each\nsubsector  over  three  phases:  2001-2004,  2005-2007,  and  2008-2010.  The  intermediate\nagendas are selected to help (i) identify specific policy measures to achieve the set goals, and\n(ii) sequence and pace such policy measures. At the same time, a series of reforms over three\nphases  suggest  sequencing  tactics  for  development  efforts  in  a  specific  subsector.  These\nreform agendas, however, include built in flexibility, to enable policymakers to add or refine the\nagenda to reflect development progress in each subsector and each phase in concert with\nchanging financial market conditions.\nE.  Lessons Learned\n80. Experiences from financial sector development and reforms in Asian economies and\nother transition economies (for example, Viet Nam and Lao PDR) are well-documented in\nvarious studies and by ADB and other aid agencies\u2019 project experiences, and offer valuable\nlessons to consider for financial sector development in Cambodia. In developing a long-term\nstrategy and program loan for financial sector development, the following are noteworthy:\n(i)  A  sound  fiscal  policy  and  price  stability  are  the  preconditions  for  a  well-\nfunctioning financial system.\n(ii)  The financial sector will not develop without public confidence in protection and\nsecurity of property rights and contract enforcement.\n(iii)  A sound financial sector cannot be created without establishing the rule of law,\nsupported by appropriate legal/judiciary system and law enforcement.\n(iv)  For  efficient  financial  intermediation,  it  is  necessary  to  develop  the  financial\nmarket infrastructure, particularly an accounting and auditing system, a credit\ninformation system, and a regulatory framework.\n(v)  Sound competition in financial markets is one of the key driving forces that lead\nto  financial  deepening  by  encouraging  financial  institutions  to  achieve\neconomies of scale and scope.\n(vi)  A sound financial system builds on sound governance principles and strong\nmarket discipline, which support a strong credit culture.", "19\n(vii)  State ownership of financial institutions and state intervention in the allocation of\nfinancial resources hinder the development of a market-based financial sector.\n(viii)  Strict entry regulation in financial industries is one of the factors that adversely\naffect financial development and the allocational efficiency of investment funds.\n(ix)  Lax entry requirements under a weak supervisory system result in an excessive\nnumber of poorly managed banks.\n(x)  For sustainable financial sector development, it is crucial to build up market-\noriented management and a sound system of operations and improvements in\ntechnical competence, commensurate with the desired change in the financial\nstructure.\n81. ADB\u2019s experience in program lending in the financial sector also offers, among others,\nthe following valuable lessons in designing a program:\n(i)  A program loan should focus on establishing the process of reform rather than\nquantitative outcomes and single, static events (process design over blueprint;\nbeing clear on where we are going as well as on how to get there).\n(ii)  Policy conditions should be front-loaded rather than back-loaded.\n(iii)  The program should build in flexibility to accommodate a dynamic environment in\nwhich reforms must be made (cluster program modality, periodic review, and\nrecalibration of targets).\n(iv)  If passage of legislation is critical, then it should be an up-front condition.\nV.  THE PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n82. A sound, efficient, and integrated financial system is fundamental to achieve broad-\nbased,  sustainable  economic  growth,  and  help  meet  the  country\u2019s  social  and  economic\ndevelopment objectives, particularly poverty reduction. Numerous constraints have hampered\nfinancial intermediation: (i) uncertainties regarding law and contract enforcement due to lack of\nan adequate body of laws and a deficient judicial system, (ii) high operating costs due to the\nabsence  of  liquidity  management  mechanism  and  other  market  infrastructure,  (iii)  high\ninformation  costs  due  to  lack  of  common  accounting  and  auditing  standards  and  other\ninfrastructure for borrower information, and (iv) weak supervisory system and capacity. A sound\nand efficient financial system will give impetus to broad-based economic growth and poverty\nreduction by enlarging job opportunities and enhancing the outreach of the formal financial\nsector to the poor and rural areas.\n83. An efficient financial system will be the first step to lay the foundation for the private\nsector development. In a survey of SMEs by IFC,19 difficulties in access to credit and other\n                  \n19\nWebster, L., and D. Boring. 2000. The Private Manufacturing Sector in Cambodia: A Survey of 63 Firms. Mekong\nProject Development Facility, and International Finance Corporation.", "20\nfinancial services were cited as one of the major impediments to the development of SMEs and\nthe private sector as a whole. Thus, a sound and efficient banking system providing credit and\nfinancial service is crucial.\n84. A  sound  and  efficient  financial  system  is  also  essential  for  attracting  foreign  direct\ninvestment, which has been the pillar of industrial development in Cambodia. Foreign investors\ninvest  in  countries  with  sound  governance  that  fosters  transparency,  accountability,\npredictability, and participation by the private sector in the formulation of laws and regulations. A\nsound and efficient financial sector is an important indicator of good governance.\n85. A robust financial sector will protect the economic system from exogenous shocks that\nare becoming more common with the continued globalization of the economy and financial\nmarkets. Those countries in Asia with the strongest legal and bank supervisory frameworks had\nstronger resistance to the negative impact of the Asian financial crisis than the countries with\nweak legal and bank supervisory frameworks.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n86. The primary goal of the FSPL is to promote the development of a sound, market-based\nfinancial system to support enhanced resource mobilization and sustainable economic growth\nby establishing the foundation for banking and insurance sectors as well as financial markets.\nThe FSPL will focus on the following activities:\n(i)  enhancing  banking  intermediation  and  public  confidence  by  establishing  and\nstrengthening banking supervision, developing key information infrastructure and\nsafety nets, and building capacity in both public and private sectors by reinforcing\ncapacity-building institutions;\n(ii)  establishing  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  insurance  development  by\ninstituting  a  supervisory  system  and  prudential  regulations,  fostering  private\nsector  development  in  the  insurance  business,  and  developing\nenforcement/monitoring mechanism for compulsory insurance;\n(iii)  laying the foundation for the development of interbank/money markets through\npublic-private sector partnership and establishing a basic legal framework; and\n(iv)  developing financial market infrastructure by establishing common accounting\nstandards  and  enforcement  mechanism  and  promulgating  laws  to  underpin\ncommercial activities and financial markets.\nC.  Policy Framework and Actions\n87. The FSPL is based on the Blueprint and ADB\u2019s previous assistance in, among others,\ngovernance reform (footnote 18) and the development of an accounting and auditing system\n(Narayan  and  Gordon,  footnote  14).  The  policy  reform  package  of  the  FSPL  focuses  on\nstrategic  policy  reforms  identified  in  Phase  I  of  the  Blueprint.  Limited  capacity  and  weak\ngovernance structure in Cambodia call for flexibility as well as strong leverage in the program\nstructure, to push forward with needed reforms. Thus, the FSPL proposes to adopt a program\ncluster approach with three back-to-back subprograms (Appendix 3).", "21\n1.  Banking Sector Development\n88. The FSPL will focus on key policy agenda for banking sector development identified in\nthe Blueprint, which includes, among others, (i) strengthening bank supervision and prudential\nregulations, (ii) supporting bank restructuring under the IMF PRGF program, (iii) developing\nbanking sector infrastructure and safety net, and (iv) strengthening capacity-building institutions.\na.  Strengthen Bank Supervision and Prudential Regulations\n89. While NBC has made substantial progress in establishing basic supervisory framework\nand prudential regulations with IMF assistance, many areas are to be addressed to strengthen\nsupervision and prudential regulations. First, old and new prudential regulations need to be\nreconciled. Some old and new regulations address the same topics. Some regulations do not\nappear among the new regulations, but language used in the new prudential regulations does\nnot explicitly cancel the old regulations.\n90. Second, the BSD of NBC must continue to strengthen its organizational structure and\ncapacity to effectively discharge supervisory responsibilities. BSD has yet to appoint adequate\nstaff in the on-site inspection unit. BSD off-site surveillance staff have begun to be introduced to\non-site inspection procedures with the help of an IMF TA and with the aid of an IMF-prepared\non-site inspection handbook. However, BSD needs to adopt comprehensive formal inspection\nand surveillance procedures to guide its staff. BSD also needs to further develop prudential\nregulations to effectively deal with problem banks at an early stage of the problem.\n91. NBC should institutionalize an anti-money-laundering policy to safeguard the banking\nsystem  against  money  laundering  and  bolster  public  confidence.  While  the  authorities\nrecognized the importance of safeguarding the banking system against criminal activities as\nthey included an explicit clause in the Banking Law addressing anti-money-laundering activities,\na regulation against money laundering has not been fully instituted due in part to lack of a sense\nof urgency. It is time for the authorities to adopt regulations against money laundering, such as\nthe compulsory reporting to NBC and other law enforcement authorities of suspicious cash\ntransactions, especially large cash transactions above some minimum threshold.\n92. To address this policy agenda, the FSPL will support the strengthening of banking\nsupervision through the following measures: (i) reconciling old prudential regulations with new\nregulations and issuing clarifying guidance to commercial banks, (ii) fully staffing the on-site\ninspection  division  of  BSD,  (iii)  adopting  surveillance  and  inspection  procedures  including\nstandardization of reports submitted by commercial banks, (iv) adopting a prompt corrective\naction system, and (v) adopting an anti-money-laundering regulation.\n93. Policy components regarding bank supervision addressed above are applied to RDB\nand MFIs with or without minor adaptation (Appendix 3), so that the FSPL will complement the\nRSCP approved in April 2000. RCSP in fact builds in direct linkage with the FSPL in terms of\nsupervision and prudential regulations, through which policy components in the FSPL will be\ndirectly applied to rural financial institutions such as RDB and MFIs. Under RCSP, RDB is\nrequired to comply with an audit and full compliance with recommendations in the audit, and\nbank regulations and the reporting requirements set by NBC on its financial performance. These\nare related to a uniform chart of bank accounts and disclosure rules and on- and off-site", "22\nsupervision procedures under the FSPL. In addition, MFIs are also required to maintain full\ncompliance with NBC\u2019s regulations for licensing, circulars, and reporting requirements.20   \nb.  Support Bank Restructuring\n94. The FSPL will support the completion of the bank restructuring program under IMF\nPRGF. To complete bank restructuring, the Government needs to address two important areas.\nFirst, the Government needs to expedite liquidation of closed banks and to prepare itself to deal\nwith  conditionally  viable  banks,  that  do  not  meet  the  conditions  specified  in  the  bank\nrestructuring  MOU.  Second,  the  Government  should  exert  systematic  efforts  to  instill\ncommercial orientation in the state-owned FTB that was recently separated from NBC and will\nbe  privatized  by  2001  under  the  IMF  program.  To  facilitate  bank  restructuring,  the  FSPL\nsupports a comprehensive training program for FTB, including accounting, risk management,\nasset/liability management, and a management information system.\nc.  Develop Banking Sector Infrastructure and Safety Net\n95. Lack of borrowers\u2019 information and uncertainties regarding law and contract enforcement\nhamper the banking operation and undermine public confidence in the banking system. To\nalleviate information asymmetry and uncertainties in the credit markets, the FSPL supports the\ndevelopment of key banking sector infrastructure and safety net in a phased way.\n96. First, the FSPL will assist the Government in developing information infrastructure. Along\nwith the adoption of common accounting standards consistent with IAS/ISA, the FSPL will\nsupport the adoption of a uniform chart of bank accounts and disclosure rules for commercial\nbanks, consistent with IAS. The uniform chart of bank accounts and disclosure rules will lay the\nfoundation of effective banking supervision, and will instill market discipline in bank operations.\nThe FSPL will also assist NBC in establishing arrangements for sharing credit information in\nclose cooperation with a bankers association. Desirably, the arrangements need to be operated\nby the bankers association under the general guidance of the supervisory authority. Thus, the\nFSPL will first support the establishment of an inclusive bankers association with articles of\nassociation approved by NBC, and will ensure that the approved articles of association include\na mandate to establish and operate an arrangement for banks sharing of credit information.\n97. Second, the FSPL will support the establishment of a secured transactions system to\nenable the enforcement of secured interest. The FSPL adopts a step-by-step approach to\ndevelop the system. It will support the adoption of a secured transactions law and development\nof a plan to establish a public registry, and then the establishment of the registry. While the\nestablishment of a secured transactions system will be an important step to facilitate banking\noperation, the system will not function fully unless the public gains confidence in the judicial\nsystem and law enforcement. Thus, the Government should push forward with the governance\nreforms envisaged in the Governance Action Plan.\n98. Third, along with the establishment of basic infrastructure, the FSPL will initiate the\ndevelopment of a banking sector safety net to bolster public confidence in the banking system.\nThe bank relicensing program aims at enhancing the soundness of the banking system by\nfacilitating the exit of nonviable banks, and thus eventually boosts public confidence in the\nsystem. However, at least in the short term, depositor confidence in the banking system has\n                  \n20\nLoan 1741-CAM: Rural Credit and Savings Project, for $20 million, approved on 20 April 2000.", "23\nsuffered due to bank closures and delays in the liquidation process. Thus, after the relicensing\nprogram  is  completed,  with  appropriate  recapitalization  and  restructuring,  the  Government\nshould consider introducing a small-depositor protection system. To support the authorities\u2019\neffort,  the  FSPL  includes  developing  a  plan  to  establish  a  deposit  insurance  system  to\nsafeguard small depositors of commercial banks.\n99. Weak contract enforcement and uncertainties have been major impediments to the\ndevelopment of rural finance. Strengthening contract enforcement by developing a secured\ntransactions system will facilitate rural finance. The FSPL also explicitly supports the application\nof  a  uniform  chart  of  bank  accounts  and  disclosure  rules  (based  on  IAS)  to  RDB,  other\nspecialized banks, and licensed MFIs. Considering the limited capacity of MFIs compared with\ncommercial banks, the FSPL envisages the application of a uniform chart of accounts and\ndisclosure rules to RDB, other specialized banks, and MFIs under Subprogram III (Appendix 3).\nd.  Strengthen Capacity-Building Institutions\n100. The FSPL will support the strengthening of the existing capacity-building institutions as\nwell as the establishment of new institutions. It will first target strengthening the existing CBS by\nseparating it from NBC and establishing it as a subsidiary of NBC with separate management\nand  accounts.  An  independent  CBS  will  not  only  facilitate  hiring  full-time  instructors  and\ncompetent managers with a competitive salary scheme different from that of NBC; it will also\npromote mobilization of external assistance with sound financial management. CBS can then be\ndeveloped into a prime training institution for the central bank and other government agencies.\nTo support the process, the FSPL will assist CBS to establish a central banking course for NBC\nprofessional staff and a mandatory course for professional staff at entry level.\n101. The FSPL will also support the establishment of a comprehensive banking institute for\nprivate bank staff to meet the increasing demand for professional training in the commercial\nbanking sector and ensure that the approved articles of association of the bankers association\ninclude a mandate to promote education, research, and training in all aspects of banking. The\nbanking institute, together with CBS, will undertake formal training in core skills (e.g., banking,\naccounting, statistical analysis, and general management), as well as specialized competencies\nnecessary for the effective operation of financial institutions in a market-based economy. The\nbanking institute should be open to staff of MFIs, so that it can accommodate training demands\nfor rural finance (Appendix 3).\n2.  Insurance Sector Development\n102. To support the implementation of the policy reform agenda identified in the Blueprint,\nthe  FSPL  will  focus  on  the  following  strategic  areas:  (i)  establishing  and  strengthening  a\nsupervisory/regulatory framework, (ii) establishing an enforcement mechanism for compulsory\ninsurance, and (iii) promoting private sector development.\na.  Establish and Strengthen Supervisory/Regulatory Framework\n103. As the first step toward the development of the insurance sector, the FSPL will support\nthe establishment of supervisory and regulatory system in a phased manner: (i) establish an\ninsurance supervisory unit under MEF, (ii) adopt a subdecree to implement the new Insurance\nLaw, and (iii) adopt a regulation to apply IAS/ISA to the insurance sector.", "24\nb.  Establish an Enforcement Mechanism for Compulsory Insurance\n104. The Government introduced compulsory insurance in the new Insurance Law in July\n2000,  and  committed  itself  to  develop  compulsory  insurance  on  par  with  that  in  member\ncountries of the Association of South East Asian Nations. Implementing compulsory insurance,\nhowever, calls for an effective enforcement and monitoring mechanism that involves related\ngovernment agencies, as well as supporting laws and regulations. To organize the efforts of\nmultiple  line  ministries  toward  the  establishment  of  an  enforcement  mechanism,  the\nGovernment should first adopt an official working plan for the development of a compulsory\ninsurance system by creating an interministerial working group. The plan should include, among\nothers, a timetable for adopting supporting laws and organizational structure, and division of\nresponsibilities in enforcement and monitoring.\nc.  Promote Private Sector Development\n105. Given the underdeveloped insurance markets and the weak basis for private sector\ndevelopment, insurance sector development hinges on increased participation of the private\nsector insurance companies and a competitive market environment. In particular, the success of\nthe newly introduced compulsory insurance critically depends on the active marketing role of the\nprivate insurance companies who are suppliers of insurance policy. As the first step to foster\nprivate sector development, the FSPL will support a joint venture between the state-owned\nCAMINCO and a private company, a plan to divest the Government\u2019s share in the joint venture\nto avoid conflict of interests, and the establishment of a transparent entry mechanism. The joint\nventure will instill commercial orientation into the state-owned company and thus expedite the\ndevelopment of insurance products.\n3.  Development of Interbank/Money Markets\n106. Development of interbank/money markets is critical to reduce the operating costs of\nbanks and other financial institutions in Cambodia. To develop interbank/money markets, the\nFSPL focuses on two reforms: creating self-regulated interbank market arrangements, and\nestablishing a legal and regulatory framework for money markets.\na.  Create Interbank Markets\n107. The first step in establishing interbank markets should be initiated by the commercial\nbanks under the guidance of NBC. With the establishment of an inclusive bankers association,\nacting on behalf of all bank members, the association must play a catalytic role in forming\ninterbank markets. Interbank market arrangements should be self-regulated by banks under the\ngeneral guideline of NBC. The first interbank service can be short-term, unsecured interbank\nlending (overnight call loan and money). The FSPL supports (i) the establishment of an inclusive\nbankers association with the mandate of establishing interbank market arrangements included\nin the articles of association, which will be subject to NBC\u2019s approval; and (ii) the creation of a\nworking group, consisting of representatives from NBC and the bankers association, when\nformed, that undertakes the task of establishing interbank market arrangements.\nb.  Establish a Legal and Regulatory Framework for Money Markets\n108. The FSPL supports the development of a legal and regulatory framework for money\nmarkets. The first task is to adopt a comprehensive negotiable instruments law that includes all\ntypes of instruments \u2013 from simple payment instruments to credit instruments. Second, NBC", "25\nshould set up the regulatory framework for the interbank market activities. The framework\nshould focus on the role of a central bank as a supervisor and monitor of the liquidity positions\nof the banks as well as the overall decision-making authority for monetary policy. Third, NBC\nshould provide detailed procedures for issuing interbank/money market instruments. Among\nthese tasks, the FSPL supports the adoption of a negotiable instruments law as the legal basis\nfor the money market instruments.\n109. Key impediments facing MFIs include heavy dependence on Government and funding\nagency assistance for resources, and high transaction and operating costs. The development of\ninterbank/money  markets  is  expected  to  lessen  these  impediments.  The  emergence  of\ninterbank markets will provide a mechanism by which RDB and MFIs can manage short-term\nliquidity and thus reduce their operating costs. Furthermore, the interbank markets will facilitate\nthe integration of RDB and MFIs into the whole banking system and provide a channel through\nwhich financial resources in urban and rural areas can be pooled and allocated by a common\nmarket mechanism. Thus, the development of and the participation of RDB and licensed MFIs in\ninterbank  markets  will  enhance  the  outreach  of  the  financial  system  into  the  rural  areas.\nAvailability of interbank markets will also partly relieve difficulties regarding funding uncertainties\nstemming from intermittent financing from funding agencies.\n4.  Development of Accounting and Legal Infrastructure\na.  Establish an of Accounting and Auditing System\n110. Establishing accounting and auditing standards and their enforcement system is an\nessential thrust of the FSPL. The Government has already committed itself to adopt IAS/ISA in\ntheir entirety. However, given its limited capacity, the Government will phase in IAS/ISA starting\nwith 15 standards of IAS and 10 standards of ISA. The FSPL will support the Government\u2019s\nefforts  in  the  following  key  areas:  (i)  promulgating  of  an  accounting  and  auditing  law;  (ii)\nadopting of a subdecree to apply IAS/ISA to all companies incorporated in Cambodia; (iii)\nestablishing a national accounting council, which will be in charge of setting and interpreting\nstandards;  (iv)  adopting  IAS  and  ISA;  (v)  establishing  an  association  of  accountants  and\nauditors; (vi) adopting a code of ethics that complies with the requirements of the International\nFederation of Accountants; and (vii) establishing committees on education and ethics within the\nassociation.\nb.  Develop Legal Infrastructure\n111. To facilitate financial sector development, the Government is expected to complete key\nlegislation  such  as  a  civil  code,  law  on  commercial  enterprises,  bankruptcy  law,  secured\ntransactions  law,  commercial  arbitration  procedure,  etc.  It  is  also  expected  to  initiate\ncomprehensive  judicial  reforms,  supported  by  ADB  and  World  Bank,  to  strengthen  law\nenforcement. In this reform agenda, the FSPL will specifically support the adoption of the law on\ncommercial enterprises.\nc.  Establish a Regulatory Framework for Corporate Financing\nActivities\n112. In line with the adoption of a law on commercial enterprises, the Government needs to\nestablish a basic law governing corporate financing, or the securities and exchange law. A\nsecurities  supervisory  authority  is  necessary  in  implementing  the  forthcoming  law  on\ncommercial  enterprises  and  accounting  and  auditing  law,  as  the  two  laws  envisage  the", "26\nsecurities supervisory authority (whether the MEF or an independent regulator) will be the main\nregulatory body to implement the laws. The securities and exchange law will provide a legal\nbasis for securities supervisory authorities. Second, once the Government puts in place a law\non  commercial  enterprises,  nonexchange-based,  grassroot  capital  market  transactions  will\noccur due to companies\u2019 financing activities. Shares of certain good firms will be traded. Equity\nparticipation  of  foreign  investors  will  increase.  Certain  good  firms  may  also  issue  debt\ninstruments. This implies that even before the Government establishes exchange-based capital\nmarkets, it would need a legal basis to regulate securities transactions over the counter and to\nprotect investors and traders \u2013 in particular, foreign direct investors.\nD.  Social and Environmental Issues\n113.  The FSPL is expected to have an impact on facilitating resource mobilization through the\nbanking and insurance system and capital markets. It will increase the efficiency of resource\nallocation, thereby facilitating economic growth and job creation and benefiting all elements of\nsociety including the poor and near poor. Appendix 4 presents the poverty impact assessment\nfor the FSPL. By developing the banking system and capital markets, the FSPL is expected to\nhave a beneficial impact on growth and employment by reducing intermediation costs and, in\nturn, reducing the cost of capital for businesses. It will also encourage direct private participation\nin economic activities. The development of interbank markets will facilitate the use of monetary\ninstruments and improve the liquidity management of banks. The improved performance of the\ninsurance system will enhance savings and the availability of productive resources to enhance\ninvestments.\n114.  The FSPL is classified as category C under ADB\u2019s environmental classification system.\nIts environmental impact is expected to be minimal. It addresses the development of a legal and\nregulatory system and market infrastructure to lay the foundation for broad-based economic\ngrowth.  Most  of  the  policy  components  are  concerned  with  such  things  as  developing  a\nsupervisory  and  regulatory  framework,  basic  market  infrastructure,  and  capacity-building\nmechanisms, but does not include investment projects.\nVI.  THE PROPOSED LOAN\nA.  Amount of Loan and Source of Funds\n115. The FSPL adopts a program cluster approach with three back-to-back subprograms\ntotaling $30 million. The program cluster approach will not only allow flexibility, but also provide\nsafeguard against inherent risks perceived in Cambodia (paras. 141-146) and strong leverage\nto push forward with needed reforms.\n116. Each subprogram loan will be for $10 million and will be processed sequentially upon the\ncompletion of the previous subprogram (Appendix 3). The program cluster is front-loaded, with\nthe first two subprograms carrying the most weighty policy reforms. Subprogram I has two\ntranches and will be completed within 12 months after loan effectiveness. Subprogram II will be\npresented  for  Board  consideration  and  approval  based  on  progress  in  implementing\nSubprogram  I,  the  status  of  proposed  policy  reform  actions,  and  the  readiness  of  the\nGovernment to undertake the proposed reforms. The conditions for Subprogram II are expected\nto be implemented within 12 months after the effectiveness of the loan agreement. However, the\nGovernment is encouraged to undertake policy conditions specified in Subprogram II up-front,\neven  before  the  loan  effectiveness  of  Subprogram  II,  whenever  feasible.  Thus,  before\npresenting the Subprogram II loan agreement for approval, ADB will further refine the proposed", "27\npolicy  reform  actions  to  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  achievements  and  changing  policy\nenvironment.  Subprogram  III  will  be  processed  in  a  similar  manner.  The  conditions  for\nSubprogram III are expected to be implemented within 12 months after the effectiveness of the\nloan agreement for Subprogram III.\n117. The processing and financial implication of the program cluster are the same as in the\ntraditional single program to the Government because the approval of subsequent programs is\nintegrated into the loan review process of the previous programs, except that the structure\nrequires a separate loan agreement for each subprogram. The Government welcomed and\nstrongly supported the subprogram cluster approach.\n118. The total loan amount for the FSPL and individual loan amounts for the subprograms are\ndetermined on the basis of the strategic significance of financial sector development and the\ncosts  of  structural  reforms  under  the  FSPL.  The  pecuniary  components  of  the  latter  are\nestimated at $80 million-$90 million equivalent, as shown in the table.\nEstimated Adjustment Costs for Key Policy Reforms of the FSPL\n($ million equivalent)\nItem Estimated Cost\nAdopting  and  enforcing  the  International  Accounting  Standards  and 37\nInternational Standards on Auditing\nEstablishing banking sector infrastructure and safety net including public 18\nregistry  of  secured  transactions,  credit  information  exchange\narrangement, and deposit insurance system\nStrengthening bank prudential regulations and bank restructuring 16\nDeveloping interbank and money markets and laying the foundation for 6\ncapital market development\nDeveloping capacity-building institutions in both private and public sectors 7\nDeveloping a legal and regulatory framework for the financial sector 6\nTotal 90\n119. Given Cambodia\u2019s situation with a shortage of human and social capital, the policy\nchanges envisaged in the FSPL involve three types of adjustment cost components, both\npecuniary and nonpecuniary. The first kind is the cost to the private and public sectors of\ncompliance  with  the  new  legal  and  regulatory  systems  and  standards  that  the  FSPL  will\nintroduce. As described in the previous section, the FSPL supports the introduction of many\nnew laws, as well as regulations and standards such as accounting and auditing standards,\nuniform chart of bank accounts and disclosure rules, new prudential regulations, on- and off-site\nsupervision  procedures,  a  prompt  corrective  action  system,  an  anti-money-laundering\nregulation, and compulsory insurance. The compliance costs are incurred partly because the\npreviously  unregulated  areas  of  financial  and  commercial  activities  are  now  subject  to\nregulations and standards, and partly because the old regulations and standards must be\nreplaced with new ones. The compliance costs can be pecuniary and nonpecuniary. While\nnonpecuniary costs and some pecuniary costs are substantial, it would be difficult to estimate\nthem because the absence of relevant markets makes the key cost components unavailable.\n120. The second type of adjustment costs will be the capacity-building cost. Given the limited\nhuman and social capital in Cambodia, almost all sectors need substantial capacity building.\nThe capacity-building costs will be incurred in the early stage of program implementation and", "28\nthus  precede  the  compliance  costs.  The  pecuniary  components  of  capacity-building  costs\ninclude, for instance, costs for training managerial and working-level staff in both private and\npublic sectors or hiring skilled staff or experts.\n121. The third type relates to the enforcement costs for the authorities and self-regulated\norganizations, which mirrors the compliance cost for the regulated parties. The enforcement\ncosts  include  mostly  institution  building,  which  has  direct  budget  implications  as  well  as\nnonpecuniary cost implications. Examples include the establishment of an on-site inspection\nunit, insurance supervisory unit, bankers association, bank training institutions in both private\nand public sectors, interbank market arrangements, arrangements for sharing credit information,\npublic  registry  for  secured  transactions,  and  deposit  insurance  system.  Like  the  capacity-\nbuilding cost components, the enforcement cost components tend to occur at the early stage of\nprogram implementation, as the authorities need to start substantial preparatory works before\nimplementation.\n122. Given the nature of the adjustment cost components, the time profile of those costs for\nthe FSPL generally corresponds to that of the implementation of the three subprograms. Since\nthe  FSPL  aims  at  process-oriented  financial  sector  development  and  the  impact  of  policy\nchanges under the FSPL extends into medium- to long-term periods, the compliance cost\ncomponents  are  spread  over  the  time  after  program  implementation,  although  some  cost\ncomponents will be incurred at the time of policy changes. Moreover, the program cluster is\ndesigned to introduce policy changes commensurate with the gradual building up of capacity\nand  enforcement  mechanisms  to  ensure  smooth  implementation,  and  each  subprogram  is\ndesigned in such way that the preceding subprogram serves as a preparatory stage for or to\nprovide inputs for the following subprogram. Thus, the capacity-building and enforcement cost\ncomponents tend to be incurred before or at the time of policy actions of each subprogram.\nConsidering the different time profiles of the three cost components, the combined weight of\nindividual policy action in terms of adjustment costs will follow an increasing pattern over time\nwhen  each  subprogram  is  implemented  sequentially.  To  balance  the  overall  weights  of\nadjustment costs across subprograms, the policy conditions in the whole program cluster are\nfront-loaded, as the first and second subprograms carry most of the difficult policy conditions.\nB.  Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n123. For  the  loan  under  Subprogram  I  of  FSPL,  the  Borrower  will  be  the  Kingdom  of\nCambodia, and the Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan will have a repayment period of 24\nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, and will carry an interest rate of 1.0 percent per\nannum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n124. The loan will be utilized within 18 months from the date of loan effectiveness. The loan\nproceeds may be used to finance eligible imports incurred within 180 days before the date of\neffectiveness.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Executing Agency\n125. NBC will be the Executing Agency for the FSPL, and will have overall responsibility for\nprogram implementation, including administering and preparing semiannual progress reports on\nprogram implementation. Implementing agencies will be MEF, MOC, NBC, and the bankers\nassociation when formed.", "29\n2.  Steering Committee\n126. A  financial  sector  steering  committee  (FSSC)  will  be  established  to  oversee\nimplementation. The FSSC will be chaired by the governor of NBC and will include senior\nrepresentatives from MEF, MOC, NBC, and the Council for the Development of Cambodia\n(CDC). The FSCC will meet at least once every three months to ensure that the proposed\nreforms are undertaken in accordance with the agreed-upon timetable, all as set forth in the list\nof actions to be taken during the FSPL. A working group will also be established under the\nFSSC to assist in and oversee day-to-day program implementation. The working group will\nconsist  of  representatives  from  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  and  CDC,  and  will  be  joined  by  a\nrepresentative of the bankers association when this is formed and recognized by NBC. Another\nworking group, called the interbank markets working group, comprising representatives from\nNBC and the bankers association will also be established to facilitate the establishment of\ninterbank markets, a banking institute, and arrangements for sharing credit information among\nthe members of the bankers association.\nD.  Procurement\n127. In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for\nprogram loans,21 goods and services produced in and originating in ADB member countries will\nbe procured, with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in accordance with standard\npublic  sector  procedures  in  Cambodia  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices,\nacceptable to ADB. In the case of goods commonly traded on the international commodity\nmarkets, they will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and\nacceptable to ADB.\nE.  Disbursement\n128. The proceeds of the FSPL will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject to a\nnegative list of ineligible items (Appendix 5). Loan proceeds will be disbursed on the basis of a\ncertification provided by the Borrower, confirming that in each year in which FSPL proceeds are\nexpected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  (i) imports  from  nonmember\ncountries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports  financed  under  other  official  development\nassistance, is equal to or greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during the year.\nThe Government will open an account (the deposit account) at NBC into which the proceeds of\nthe loans will be deposited and from which all withdrawals will be made. Monthly statements of\nthe deposit account will be attached to the semiannual report of the FSPL.\nF.  Counterpart Funds\n129. The policy framework for the FSPL includes specific components that bear distinct costs\nof structural adjustments. The counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds will be\nused to finance the structural adjustment costs under the FSPL. Any counterpart funds not\nrequired will be used for general development purposes.\n                  \n21\n R50-98: Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, 16 April 1998.", "30\nG. Monitoring and Tranching\n1.  Subprogram I\n130. The loan for Subprogram I is to be released in two tranches: (i) $5 million upon loan\neffectiveness, and (ii) $5 million within 12 months subject to the fulfillment of specified second\ntranche release conditions. ADB will review with the Government progress in implementing\nspecified policy actions set out in the policy matrix, about three months prior to the scheduled\ntranche release. The conditions for the first and second tranche releases follow.\na.  Conditions for First Tranche Release\n131. The Government has complied with the up-front policy actions and the first tranche can\nbe released as soon as the loan agreement becomes effective. These actions follow:\n(i)  NBC  to  reconcile  old  prudential  regulations  with  new  regulations  and  issue\nclarifying guidance to commercial banks.\n(ii)  NBC  to  fully  staff  the  on-site  inspection  division  of  Banking  Supervision\nDepartment, acceptable to ADB.\n(iii)  MEF to establish an insurance supervisory unit within MEF.\n(iv)  MEF to adopt a subdecree to implement the Insurance Law.\n(v)  NBC to recognize the bankers association as a self-regulatory organization.

NBC and the bankers association to establish a working group\nto  establish  interbank  market  arrangements,  a  banking  institute,  and\narrangements for sharing credit information among the members of the bankers\nassociation.\n(vi)  NBC to adopt a formal procedure for soliciting comments from the private sector\non proposed, or revisions to, laws, regulations, procedures, and policies affecting\nthe banking sector.\nb.  Conditions for Second Tranche Release\n132. For the release of the second tranche, the following eight conditions must be complied\nwith:\n(i)  NBC to adopt surveillance and inspection procedures including standardization of\nthe reports submitted by commercial banks. Unless specified otherwise in the\nNBC regulations, these procedures are also to be applied to licensed MFIs.\n(ii)  NBC  to  adopt  a  prompt  corrective  action  system  for  commercial  banks,\nacceptable to ADB. A similar system is to be applied to licensed MFIs with\nmodified capital adequacy standards.", "31\n(iii)  NBC to adopt an anti-money-laundering regulation. Unless specified otherwise in\nthe NBC regulations, this regulation is also to be applied to licensed MFIs.\n(iv)  NBC to establish CBS as a subsidiary of NBC, with separate management and\naccounts.\n(v)  NBC to ensure that FTB management adopts a comprehensive training program\nfor FTB staff, including accounting, risk management, asset/liability management,\nand management information system.\n(vi)  MOC to submit to the National Assembly a draft law on commercial enterprises.\n(vii)  MEF to submit to the National Assembly a draft law on corporate accounts, their\naudit and the accounting profession.\n(viii)  MEF to adopt IAS and ISA, which will be applied upon the adoption of the law on\ncorporate accounts, their audit and the accounting profession.\n2.  Subprogram II\n133. The  proposed  loan  for  Subprogram  II  of  the  FSPL  will  be  $10  million  from  ADF.\nTranching is still to be determined. Policy actions for Subprogram II are subject to revision and\nrefinement following ADB\u2019s reassessment of the macroeconomic environment, lessons learned\nin  Subprogram  I,  and  the  status  of  implementation  and  readiness  of  the  Government  to\nundertake the proposed policy reform actions in connection with related reforms specified in the\nBlueprint. The conditions for Subprogram II are envisaged to be implemented within 12 months\nof  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement  for  Subprogram  II.  Proposed  conditions  for\nSubprogram II are as follows:\n(i)  Adoption  of  a  law  on  corporate  accounts,  their  audit  and  the  accounting\nprofession.\n(ii)  Adoption of a law on commercial enterprises.\n(iii)  NBC to adopt a uniform chart of bank accounts and disclosure rules for the\ncommercial banks, consistent with IAS.\n(iv)  NBC to adopt a guideline for the arrangements for sharing credit information\namong the members of the bankers association, and NBC and the Bankers\nassociation to establish such arrangements.\n(v)  MOC to submit to the National Assembly a draft secured transactions law.\n(vi)  MOC to adopt a plan to establish a public registry for secured transactions,\nacceptable to ADB.\n(vii)  NBC to ensure that CBS establish a central banking course for NBC professional\nstaff, including mandatory training program for professional staff at entry level.\n(viii)  MEF to establish a joint venture between the state-owned insurance company\nand a private insurance company.\n(ix)  MEF to adopt a plan for the development of compulsory insurance.", "32\n(x)  MEF to adopt a regulation to apply accounting standards consistent with IAS/ISA\nto insurance companies.\n(xi)  MOC to submit to the National Assembly a draft negotiable instruments law.\n(xii)  MEF to submit to the National Assembly a draft securities and exchange law.\n(xiii)  MEF to adopt a subdecree to apply IAS/ISA to all companies incorporated in\nCambodia, and to establish a national accounting council to set and interpret\nstandards, etc.\n134. Among  the  conditions,  (i)  and  (ii)  will  be  included  as  the  Board  consideration  of\nconditions for Subprogram II.\n3.  Subprogram III\n135. The  proposed  loan  for  Subprogram  III  of  the  FSPL  will  be  $10  million  from  ADF.\nTranching and the revision of policy conditions for Subprogram III will be determined as they are\nfor Subprogram II. The conditions for Subprogram III are envisaged to be implemented in 12\nmonths  after  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement  for  Subprogram  III.  The  Proposed\nconditions for Subprogram III are as follows:\n(i)  NBC to apply the uniform chart of bank accounts and disclosure rules for the\ncommercial banks consistent with IAS to RDB, other specialized banks, and\nlicensed MFIs.\n(ii)  NBC to adopt a plan to establish a deposit insurance system for commercial\nbanks.\n(iii)  Adoption of a secured transactions law.\n(iv)  MOC to establish a public registry for secured transactions.\n(v)  NBC to ensure that the bankers association establish a banking institute for\nprivate bank staff under the bankers association, pursuant to its approved articles\nof association, and establish a professional training course for private bank staff.\nThe banking institute should be open to staff of MFIs.\n(vi)  MEF  to  adopt  a  plan  to  divest  MEF\u2019s  share  in  the  joint-venture  insurance\ncompany.\n(vii)  Adoption of a negotiable instruments law.\n(viii)  Adoption of a securities and exchange law.\n(ix)  MEF to establish an association of accountants and auditors, to adopt a code of\nethics that complies with the requirements of the International Federation of\nAccountants, and to establish committees on education and ethics within the\nassociation.\n136. Among the conditions, (iii), (vii), and (viii) will be included as the Board consideration of\nconditions for Subprogram III.", "33\n4.  Monitoring\n137. ADB, in cooperation with NBC, MEF, MOC, and CDC, will carry out semiannual reviews\nof progress in program implementation, and will assess the program\u2019s impact on the financial\nand other sectors of the economy. The Government and ADB will continue to engage in active\npolicy dialogue throughout FSPL implementation on issues that may affect financial sector\ndevelopment and additional reforms that may be necessary or desirable for the sustainable\ndevelopment of the financial sector (which may result in the revision of the Blueprint). The\nGovernment will keep ADB informed of outcomes of the policy discussions with the IMF and the\nWorld Bank Group and other multilateral and bilateral funding agencies that have implications\nfor FSPL implementation.\n138. The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  semiannual  reports  on  FSPL  implementation,\nparticularly on policy actions set out in the policy matrix, the development policy letter, and the\nBlueprint, as well as on the accomplishment of the FSPL objectives. In case the Government\nupdates or revises the Blueprint, the semiannual reports will also include the rationale and\ncontents of such revisions. Semiannual reports will be submitted in such form and in such detail\nand within such period as ADB may request, and will include (i) progress made and problems\nencountered during the six months under review, (ii) steps taken or proposed to be taken to\nremedy  the  problems  encountered,  and  (iii)  the  proposed  detailed  activity  for  FSPL\nimplementation and expected progress during the next six months. On completion of the FSPL,\nbut in any event not later than six months, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a\ncomprehensive report on the overall impact of the policy reforms implemented. Monitoring\nindicators and mechanisms are given in the program framework (Appendix 6).\nVII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Benefits\n139. Cambodia\u2019s  underdeveloped  financial  system  is  potentially  the  most  significant\nconstraint to broad-based economic growth and achieving the Government\u2019s socioeconomic\ndevelopment  objectives,  particularly,  poverty  reduction.  The  beneficial  impacts  on  poverty\nassociated with the FSPL can be summarized as follows:\n(i)  Strengthening the prudential and supervisory framework for commercial banks is\nexpected to promote the development of a sound and viable banking system and\nimprove access of the more vulnerable and poorer segments of the population to\nfinancial service;\n(ii)  Strengthening  the  banking  system  will  render  banks  more  resilient  and\ninvulnerable to disruptions to the banking system from external shocks, which\nundermine growth prospects, wipe out savings, and lead to significant fiscal\nrestructuring costs; and\n(iii)  A consolidated, restructured, and well-regulated banking system will (a) on the\nexpenditure side, free up public sector resources to invest in productive activities\nsuch as infrastructure or social sectors (i.e., health and education), which may\notherwise have been reallocated to bank restructuring or recapitalization; and (b)\non the revenue side, relax credit constraints and strengthen credit to the private\nsector, expanding GDP growth and with it, the taxable revenue base to meet the", "34\nsocial safety net and other social expenditure needs to minimize the vulnerability\nof the poor segment of the population.\n140. The financial sector reforms under the FSPL are necessary to ensure a stable, viable,\nand competitive financial system based on improved asset quality in the banking system, and a\nmore  efficient  banking  intermediation  process.  Development  of  the  insurance  sector  and\ninterbank markets will create an enabling environment necessary to ensure domestic resource\nmobilization  including  long-term  sources  of  investment  funds  to  complement  the  lending\nchannels intermediated through the banking system. The reforms under the FSPL are expected\nto have a positive impact on savings and investment in the economy.\nB.  Risks and Safeguards\n141. The principal risk lies in unexpected political disturbance. The country has been enjoying\na very high level of political unity and stability, and the comprehensive reform programs in place\nshould lead to significant progress in economic growth. However, Cambodia will go into a\npolitical season up to early 2002, as the National Assembly and the Senate of Cambodia\npassed the Commune Election and Commune Administration Laws in January and February\n2001, respectively.22 At the moment, the commune elections could take place as early as\nJanuary 2002 after final approval of the law by the Constitutional Council and the King, giving\nthe National Election Committee less than a year to prepare for a major undertaking involving\npotentially thousands of candidates.\n142. There may be risks associated with weak capacity at the institution level, the ability to\nrecruit and retain qualified cadres and staff, and poor coordination between policy-making\nagencies. While risks associated with weak capacity are typical in policy reform programs, those\nfactors need special attention in designing a program loan in Cambodia.\n143. Another risk may be related to \u201claw fatigue.\u201d Given the deficient legal environment in\nCambodia,  the  Government  has  been  expediting  a  substantial  volume  of  legislation  in  a\nrelatively short period. However, there have been some cases where adopted laws are not fully\nimplemented, despite all the efforts of the Government and aid agencies. This stems in part\nfrom lack of consultation with stakeholders including the private sector and aid agencies and in\npart from weak institutional capacity.\n144. The FSPL includes safeguards in the design of the overall framework of assistance.\nFirst, the FSPL adopts the program cluster approach, with three back-to-back subprograms that\ncontain doable sets of policy reforms in a relatively short period (e.g., one year). The program\ncluster approach introduces flexibility to accommodate various types of risks by allowing further\nrefinement of policy conditions reflecting changing environments, while pursuing the original\nobjectives of the program cluster concept, approved by the Board.\n145. The FSPL will also be supported by an ADTA to reduce the downside risks from weak\ncapacity. An ADTA will be processed to assist the Government in implementing policy reform\nmeasures.23\n                  \n22\nNational elections are likely to be held in 2003, thereby potentially prolonging the upcoming period of political\ninstability.\n23 A capacity-building TA had been in the pipeline for 2001 and was supposed to be piggybacked to this program, but\nit was rescheduled to 2002 due to the scaling down of the TA budget early in 2001. However, on July 31, the\nFrench Government confirmed its funding for an ADTA for capacity building in banking and financial management.", "35\n146. Risks associated with \u201claw fatigue\u201d can be minimized by instituting procedures for broad\nand regular consultation with the private sector stakeholders. In this regard, the Government\nhas already made substantial progress. On 25 January 2001, the Government adopted the\nPrime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  on  the  Formation  of  a  Sectoral  Working  Group  for  Consultation\nPartnership with the Private Sector, which mandated the creation of procedures for private\nsector consultation in seven major areas including banking and financial service. While it is\nunderstood that the procedure can also be utilized as a private sector consultation procedure for\nlegislation, the FSPL explicitly supports the adoption of a formal consultation procedure for\nlegislation with the banking sector as one of the policy conditions of Subprogram I (Appendix 3).\nVIII.  ASSURANCES\n147.

Mr. Tadao Chino\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\nSubject: DEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER\nLong-Term Financial Sector Development Plan and Program Loan Cluster\nfor Financial Sector Development Program\nYour Excellency,\n1. This letter refers to the request of the Royal Government of Cambodia (the Government)\nfor assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for support of policy reform efforts\nunder the proposed Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP). As its strong commitment\nto undertakings envisaged in FSDP, the Government is pleased to inform ADB that it has\nformally adopted the Financial Sector Blueprint for 2001-2010 (the Blueprint) prepared under\nADB's  recently  completed  technical  assistance  (TA3467-CAM:  Preparing  for  the  Financial\nSector Development Program) as the Government's official financial sector development plan.\nThis  letter  spells  out  the  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  and  strategy  for  financial  sector\ndevelopment  and  key  elements  of  the  Blueprint,  as  well  as  objectives,  scope,  and  main\nelements of the FSDP.\nI.  FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT ISSUES\n2. Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  is  at  a  rudimentary  stage,  with  limited  financial\nintermediation and low public confidence. Cambodia has one of the lowest rates of banking\nintermediation in the world: bank loans and deposits account for approximately 8 percent and 12\npercent of GDP, respectively.\n3. Currently Cambodia has 20 commercial banks after National Bank of Cambodia (NBC)'s\nre-licensing program in 2000, which revoked the licenses of eleven non-viable banks. Other\nfinancial institutions operating in Cambodia include insurance companies, currency exchange\nbureaus, and microfinance institutions. In the rural area, banking activities are even scarcer, and\nmicrofinance operations of NGOs are the major providers of credit. There are no recognized\ninterbank/money markets and capital markets in Cambodia.\n4. A number of factors contribute to the low level of intermediation, poor asset quality, and\nhigh operating costs for financial institutions. All these factors hamper public confidence and\nhinder deposit mobilization, as the majority of money in the economy is held outside of the\nfinancial system.\nPage 1 of 10", "50 Appendix 2, page 2\n5. Weak financial infrastructure hampers the development of financial sector. Cambodia\nhas yet to develop or strengthen laws pertaining to accounting, negotiable instruments, secured\ntransactions,  commercial  enterprises,  bankruptcy,  contracts  and  commercial  credit,  etc.  In\naddition, the public confidence in the judicial system is very low. Lack of the rule of law has\nhampered  the  development  of  contract-based  credit  culture  and  thus  one  of  the  primary\nimpediments to the private sector development. Moreover, Cambodia has yet to adopt common\naccounting/audit standards. Not many companies produce audited financial statements, and\ncompanies produce financial statements using different standards. Lack of common accounting\nstandards and enforcement has not only increased the risk and cost of banking operations, but\nalso deters the development of capital markets.\n6. Lack of financial information infrastructure impedes bank lending and leads to poor asset\nquality. Bankers are unable to lend based on cash-flow analysis due to lack of clients\u2019 financial\ninformation. As a result, they are compelled to lend against collateral as the primary source of\nrepayment, which is further compromised by a lack of infrastructure for secured transactions.\nFurthermore,  Cambodia  lacks  a  credit  bureau  or  other  arrangements,  by  which  credit\ninformation that can be accessed and shared by the members of the Bankers Association.\n7. Lack  of  liquidity  management  mechanisms  incurs  opportunity  costs  to  banks.  The\nbanking sector maintains abnormally high levels of liquidity due to the lack of interbank markets\nto effectively manage liquidity. Furthermore, NBC is unable to provide liquidity to commercial\nbanks  to  meet  temporary  liquidity  shortages.  Although  the  Law  on  the  Organization  and\nConduct of the National Bank of Cambodia provides the legal basis for rediscount facilities, all\neligible  negotiable  instruments  such  as  bills  of  exchange,  promissory  notes,  etc.,  are  not\navailable  due  to  the  lack  of  a  Negotiable  Instruments  Law  and  other  necessary  legal\ninfrastructure.\n8. Weak supervisory capacity and regulatory framework impedes early identification of\nbanking problems, and the timely and orderly resolution of problem banks. The basic framework\nand capacity for on-site inspection and off-site surveillance have yet to be in place. There is no\nprompt corrective action system. In addition, weak capacity and shortcomings in the legal and\nregulatory framework for bank liquidation has hampered and delayed the early and orderly\nliquidation of delicensed banks. Both the existing bank regulations and the capacity of the\nsupervisory department of NBC need strengthening. The framework for insurance supervision\nhas yet to be developed.\n9. Finally, the financial system lacks human resource capacity. Key regulatory bodies such\nas NBC and Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) need substantial capacity building to\nproperly  discharge  supervisory  and  regulatory  responsibilities.  However,  capacity  building\ninstitutions are constrained by limited human and financial resources. Furthermore, most of\ncommercial  bank  staff  lack  training  in  credit  analysis,  loan  monitoring,  and  problem  loan\nmanagement, although many of the commercial banks have experienced and competent senior\nmanagers.\nII.  FINANCIAL SECTOR BLUEPRINT\n10. Although the recent banking sector restructuring and other policy reforms under the IMF\nPoverty Reduction and Growth Facility have generally been moving in the right direction, it is the\nview of the Government that Cambodia needs to exert coherent and systematic efforts to\ndevelop a sound market-based financial system to support resource mobilization and a broad-\nbased sustainable economic growth.\nPage 2 of 10", "51 Appendix 2, page 3\n11. With these objectives in mind, the Government has formulated the long-term vision and\ndevelopment strategy for the financial sector with the technical assistance from ADB. The long-\nterm vision and development strategy has been developed based on key lessons drawn from\nthe experience of other Asian economies in financial sector development, as well as from the\ncurrent situation in Cambodia.\nA.  Long-Term Vision and Development Strategy\n12. Financial  sector  development  crucially  depends  on  governance  reform.  One  of  the\ncritical challenges facing Cambodia in governance is to strengthen accountability of institutions\nin the public sector. The necessary reforms include, among others, (i) public administration\nreform, (ii) public finance reform, and (iii) legal and judiciary reform.\n13. If the governance reform programs envisaged in Socio-Economic Development Plan II\nand the Governance Action Plan are fully implemented, it is expected that the Cambodian\neconomy will be able to sustain an average annual economic growth rate of 6-7 percent over\nthe medium-term.\n14. Building  on  the  development  prospect  to  be  achieved  from  successful  governance\nreform, the Blueprint anticipates that the financial sector will at least double in terms of the ratio\nof financial assets to GDP in ten years. The spread between loan and deposit rates will narrow\nas intermediation becomes more efficient owing to macroeconomic stability, improved legal and\nfinancial infrastructure, and increased competition among banks and other financial institutions.\n15. The vision will be achieved by ensuring the following:\n(i)  a  competitive,  safe,  and  sound  banking  system  that  is  well  regulated  and\nsupervised and effectively mobilizes savings to provide financing to support the\ngrowth of the private sector;\n(ii)  the  establishment  and  development  of  non-bank  financial  institutions  that\nincrease the depth of financial sector by providing a broad array of diversified\nservices such as leasing and consumer finance;\n(iii)  an insurance sector that protects businesses and individuals from catastrophic\nevents and a pension system that provides a secure retirement, both of which\nprovide capital for long-term investment in the real sector;\n(iv)  a safe and reliable system for the transfer of funds between customers and\nbanks and the settlement of payments between banks;\n(v)  money/interbank markets that provide banks, companies, and individuals with the\nmeans for effective liquidity management;\n(vi)  efficient  and  transparent  capital  markets  with  a  critical  mass  of  issuers  that\nmobilize funds for long-term investment;\n(vii)  a legal system that promotes and enforces the rule of law in commercial and\nfinancial  transactions  and  that  supports  good  governance  by  promoting\ntransparency, accountability, participation, and predictability;\nPage 3 of 10", "52 Appendix 2, page 4\n(viii)  an accounting and audit system based on international standards that supports\ngood governance by promoting transparency, accountability, participation, and\npredictability; and\n(ix)  human resource development based on performance based compensation and\npromotion and the availability of a broad range of professional programs that\nretrains existing staff and provides ongoing training.\n16. The Government has adopted a long-term strategy for financial sector development in\nCambodia, which comprises the following elements:\n(i)  maintaining  sound  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  to  ensure  macroeconomic\nstability;\n(ii)  establishing  a  sound  legal  framework  to  protect  property  rights  and  enforce\ncontracts;\n(iii)  establishing the rule of law through legal/judicial reform to underpin financial and\ncommercial activities;\n(iv)  sequencing  efforts  to  develop  financial  infrastructure,  particularly\npayment/clearing  system,  accounting/audit  system,  credit  information  system,\nand regulatory framework;\n(v)  structuring  the  regulatory  and  policy  framework  to  foster  competition  in  the\nfinancial markets and to encourage financial institutions to realize the economies\nof scale and scope;\n(vi)  establishing  a  regulatory  and  institutional  framework  to  promote  sound\ngovernance principles and to allow market discipline to work in the management\nand operations of financial institutions;\n(vii)  establishing a sound framework for private sector development in the financial\nsystem by phasing-out state-ownership and state intervention in the system;\n(viii)  developing a transparent entry framework to encourage efficiency and financial\ndeepening;\n(ix)  developing efficient exit mechanisms for troubled institutions to foster continuous\nreorganization in the financial system without incurring social costs; and\n(x)  developing human and institutional capacity in both private and public sectors\nthrough public-private sector partnership.\nB.  Sector Development Plan\n17. Under the guidance of the long-term strategy, the Blueprint details sector development\nstrategy  and  policy  reform  agenda.  The  sector  development  plan  explicitly  considers  the\ninterrelation of (i) human and institutional capacity building, (ii) developments in related financial\ninfrastructure, (iii) establishment of a legal and regulatory framework, (iv) emergence of relevant\nfinancial markets, and (v) availability of technology. The sector development strategy is a rolling\nPage 4 of 10", "53 Appendix 2, page 5\nplan, which needs continuous updating to reflect the Government\u2019s achievements as well as the\nchanging  socio-economic  environment.  The  Government  is  committed  to  implementing  the\nsector development plans specified in the Blueprint, as well as to continuously updating the\nsector development plan to reflect the Government\u2019s achievements and the changing socio-\neconomic environment, thus maximizing the development impact.\n1.  Banking Sector\n18. The Blueprint for the banking sector consists of a strategic goal for each of the three\nphases. The first phase (2001 to 2004) aims at laying the foundation for the banking system by\nestablishing  basic  policy  and  institutional  framework.  The  second  phase  aims  to  enhance\nintermediation through competition. Building on the achievements in the first phase, the banking\nsystem should be developed into a more consolidated system through competition among\nbanks, intermediation will be expanded and banking services will be extended to rural areas.\nThe third phase aims to promote intermediation efficiency by facilitating the integration of the\nformal and informal financial sectors as well as the reorganization of the banking industry. An\nintegrated banking sector will enhance efficiency and quality of banking services in the rural\nareas.\n2.  Insurance Sector and Pension System\n19. The development of the insurance sector will also go through three phases. To improve\nthe  current  weak  legal  infrastructure  and  supervisory  capacity,  the  first  phase  aims  at\nestablishing the foundation and building capacity for the sector. With a solid foundation in place,\nthe insurance sector will develop in terms of size and diversity. The focus of the second phase\nwill be to promote the insurance market through private sector development, to increase the\noutreach to poor and rural areas, to implement compulsory insurance, and to enhance product\nvariety. The implementation of compulsory insurance will create policy-driven demand, and the\ngrowing income will generate demand for a greater variety of insurance products. In response to\nthe growing sophistication and volume of business in the insurance sector, an independent\ninsurance  supervisory  and  regulatory  body  will  be  established.  As  the  insurance  sector\nexpands, the independent insurance supervisor will further upgrade prudential regulations in the\nthird phase.\n20. During the first phase of pension system development, the feasibility and design for\nestablishing  a  multi-pillar  pension  system  will  be  completed.  During  Phase  II,  the  legal,\nregulatory, and supervisory frameworks will be established for the pension system. In addition, a\ncapacity-building mechanism will be needed to ensure properly trained staff in the regulatory\nand supervisory body. During Phase III, the legal framework will be enhanced through the\nissuance of sub-decrees. The mandatory public pension program will be launched and the\nsupervisory  and  regulatory  framework  will  be  further  strengthened  in  anticipation  of  the\nimplementation  of  the  mandatory  privately  managed  funded  pension  program  that  will  be\nimplemented after Phase III.\n3.  Non-Banking Financial Institutions\n21. The development of non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs) begins in the second\nphase. The development goal is to provide a legal and regulatory framework for the NBFIs\ncommensurate with the development of interbank/money markets and capital markets. Thus the\ngoal of Phase II is to establish the foundation of laws and regulations for NBFIs such as leasing\ncompanies, finance companies, investment companies and money market broker/dealers. The\nPage 5 of 10", "54 Appendix 2, page 6\ngoal of Phase III is set to further develop the NBFI sector including trust companies, venture\ncapital  companies  and  longer-term  development  finance  institutions.  These  institutions  will\nsupport the development of money and capital markets.\n4.  Interbank/Money Markets\n22. The sequencing and pacing of money markets development will match the development\nof  the  banking  and  non-banking  sectors  The  development  plan  for  interbank  and  money\nmarkets targets three strategic goals. The first phase aims to establish the foundation for a\nmarket in short-term unsecured interbank lending, and provide a base for money markets\n(including Treasury Bills), based on a Negotiable Instruments Law. The second phase will\nstrengthen  the  interbank  markets,  by  establishing  regulations  for  diverse  money  market\ninstruments such as negotiable CDs, repurchase agreements, etc., as well as by regularizing\nthe issuance of Treasury Bills with the development of a primary dealer system. The third phase\nis to broaden money markets with a regulatory framework for non-financial issuers of money\nmarket instruments such as commercial papers.\n5.  Capital Markets\n23. The Government has taken initial actions in developing capital markets, and this process\nwill continue. During the first phase, necessary preparatory work is expected to create an\nenabling environment for capital markets. In the second phase, it is envisaged to establish the\nfoundation  for  capital  markets  by  developing  necessary  infrastructure  related  to  securities\ntrading, as well as adopting detailed regulations and procedures. Building on the preparatory\nwork, it is expected that the Government will make a systematic effort to develop capital\nmarkets in the third phase.\n6.  Financial Market Infrastructure\na.  Development of Legal Infrastructure\n24. The  development  of  the  legal  infrastructure  for  financial  markets  also  targets  three\nreform agenda over the next ten years. The goal in Phase I is to introduce key laws pertaining\nto commercial activities to underpin financial sector development. In Phase II, law enforcement\nwill be strengthened with the progress in court reforms and capacity building. Phase III will\nfocus on enhancing legal infrastructure for private sector development; during the period, a legal\nframework for public registration system for movables will be established.\nb.  Development of the Accounting/Audit System\n25. The accounting/audit system is the base for financial sector development and demands\nurgent attention. The goal in Phase I is to establish accounting/audit standards and a system for\ntheir enforcement through promulgation of a Law on Corporate Accounts, their Audit and the\nAccounting Profession, adoption of IAS/ISA standards, and establishment of an accounting\nprofessional  body  and  an  Accounting/Audit  Standards  Board.  In  Phase  II,  the  accounting\nassociation  will  strengthen  the  enforcement  of  accounting/audit  standards,  and  promote\ncompetition in accounting industry to reduce accounting/audit compliance costs of the private\nsector. In Phase III, enforcement of accounting standards and expansion of IAS to more firms\nwill occur.\nPage 6 of 10", "55 Appendix 2, page 7\nc.  Development of Financial Information Infrastructure\n26. For efficient financial intermediation, development of a financial information system is\ncrucial to cultivate credit and repayment culture in the early stage of financial development. In\nPhase I, the Government will create the financial market information system via banker-led\narrangements for sharing credit information. During Phase II, the Government will expand the\nscope of the arrangements to non-bank institutions. In Phase III, financial market information\nsystem will be further diversified by including a credit rating industry.\nd.  Development of a Financial Sector Safety Net\n27. A financial safety net will be developed to bolster public confidence in the financial\nsystem. As the financial system expands, so do the systemic risks. The development of the\nfinancial safety net includes a two-stage reform agenda starting from Phase II. The goal of\nPhase II is to develop a banking sector safety net with the establishment of deposit insurance\nand corporate governance guidelines. Phase III will expand deposit insurance to the non-\nbanking sector participants who join the payment system.\nIII.  FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n28. Although necessary, the implementation of the long-term policy reform envisaged under\nthe Blueprint is challenging to the Government due to the limited social capital and capacity.\nThus, the Government is in need of, and thus requests, systematic and concerted financial\nassistance and policy advice from international institutions. As the first step of such assistance,\nthe Government requests for ADB\u2019s proposed Financial Sector Development Program.\n29. The Government is committed to achieve the following goals of the FSDP, as an effort to\nimplement the reform agenda in the Blueprint:\n(i)  enhancing banking intermediation and public confidence in the banking system\nand building capacity in both public and private sectors,\n(ii)  establishing legal and regulatory framework for insurance sector development,\n(iii)  laying the foundation for the development of interbank/money markets, and\n(iv)  developing financial market infrastructure by establishing common accounting\nstandards and enforcement mechanisms as well as introducing key legislation.\n1.  Banking Sector Development\n30. Under the FSDP, the Government will focus on key policy agenda to address key\nimpediments identified in the Blueprint, which include, among others, (i) strengthening bank\nsupervision  and  prudential  regulations,  (ii)  completion  of  bank  restructuring  under  the  IMF\nPRGF  program,  (iii)  developing  banking  sector  infrastructure  and  safety  net,  and  (iv)\nestablishment and strengthening of capacity building institutions.\n31. First, to strengthen bank supervision and prudential regulations, the Government\nwill (i) reconcile old prudential regulations with new regulations and issue clarifying guidance to\ncommercial  banks,  (ii)  fully  staff  the  on-site  inspection  division  of  Banking  Supervision\nDepartment, (iii) adopt surveillance and inspection procedures including standardization of the\nPage 7 of 10", "56 Appendix 2, page 8\nreports submitted by commercial banks, (iv) adopt a prompt corrective action system acceptable\nto ADB, and (v) adopt and implement an anti-money laundering regulation.\n32. Second,  the  Government  will  complete  bank  restructuring,  which  has  been\nundertaken under the IMF PRGF. In particular, the Government will make efforts to expedite\nliquidation of closed banks and prepare itself to deal with conditionally viable banks, which do\nnot comply with the conditions specified in the bank restructuring MOU signed between those\nbanks and NBC. Under FSDP, the Government will adopt a comprehensive training program for\nFTB including accounting, risk management, asset/liabilities management, MIS, etc.\n33. Third, the Government will develop banking sector infrastructure and safety net.\nAlong  with  the  adoption  of  common  accounting  standards  consistent  with  IAS/ISA,  the\nGovernment will adopt a uniform chart of bank accounts and a disclosure rule consistent with\nIAS for the commercial banks. The Government will also establish arrangements for sharing\ncredit information among the members of the Bankers Association and secured transactions\nsystem. In addition, the Government will initiate the development of banking sector safety net to\nbolster the public confidence in the banking system. That is, the Government will work out an\nofficial  plan  to  develop  a  deposit  insurance  system  to  safeguard  small  depositors  in  the\ncommercial banks.\n34. Fourth,  the  Government  will  strengthen  capacity  building  institutions.  The\nGovernment will first strengthen the existing Center for Banking Studies (CBS) by separating it\nfrom NBC, and establish as a subsidiary of NBC with separate management and accounts. To\ndevelop CBS as a prime training institution for central bank and other government agencies, the\nGovernment will establish a central banking course for NBC professional staff and a mandatory\ncourse for the entry-level professional staff in CBS. The Government will also support the\nestablishment of a comprehensive banking institute for private bank staff under the bankers\nassociation to meet an increasing demand for professional training in the banking sector.\n2.  Insurance Sector Development\n35. The Government is committed to insurance sector development envisaged under FSDP,\nfocussing  on  the  following  strategic  areas:  (i)  establishing  and  strengthening  of\nsupervisory/regulatory  framework,  (ii)  establishing  regulatory  framework  for  compulsory\ninsurance, (iii) promoting private sector development, and (iv) capacity building in the insurance\nsector.\n36. First,  the  Government  will  establish  and  strengthen  supervisory/regulatory\nframework for insurance by establishing an insurance supervisory unit under MEF, adopting\nsub-decree to implement the new Insurance Law, and adopting regulations to apply IAS/ISA to\nthe insurance sector.\n37. Second, the Government will make concerted efforts with the related line ministries to\nestablish a regulatory framework for compulsory insurance. The Government will set up an\ninter-ministerial working group to draft an official plan for compulsory insurance development.\nThe  plan  will  include,  among  others,  adoption  of  supporting  laws  and  establishment  of\nenforcement and monitoring mechanism.\n38. Third, the Government will promote private sector development in the insurance\nsector. As the first step for the private sector development, the Government will complete the\nestablishment of joint venture between the state-owned CAMINCO and a private company, and\nPage 8 of 10", "57 Appendix 2, page 9\nadopt a plan to divest the Government\u2019s share in the joint venture to avoid conflict of interests,\nalong with the establishment of a transparent entry mechanism for the private sector.\n39. Fourth,  the  Government  will  also  exert  efforts  to build  capacity  in  the  insurance\nsector. Due to the short history of the sector, initial capacity building efforts will need assistance\nfrom donor agencies and foreign insurance training institutes. The Government will establish a\ntraining program for capacity building in related Government agencies, which will be involved in\nthe enforcement and monitoring of compulsory insurance. The capacity building will be an\nintegral part of the official plan for compulsory insurance. As the sector size increases and\nproducts diversify, the Government will also consider the establishment of a comprehensive\ninsurance training institute.\n3.  Development of Interbank/Money Markets\n40. Development of interbank/money market is critical to help reduce operating costs of\nbanks and other financial institutions in Cambodia. The Government will play a pivotal role in\nestablishing  interbank/money  markets.  For  this,  the  Government  will  fully  support  the\nestablishment  of  an  inclusive  bankers  association.  The  Government  will  also  adopt  a\ncomprehensive Negotiable Instruments Law, which covers all types of instruments from simple\npayment instruments to credit instruments. In addition, the Government will set up the regulatory\nframework  for  the  interbank  market  activities,  and  provide  detailed  procedures  for  issuing\ninterbank/money market instruments.\n41. The Government will continue to make efforts to create an enabling environment for\ncapital  market  development.  To  begin  with,  the  Government  will  adopt  a  Securities  and\nExchange Law following the promulgation of Law on Commercial Enterprises and Law on\nCorporate Accounts, their Audit and the Accounting Profession.\n4.  Development of Accounting and Legal Infrastructure\n42. In  recognition  of  the  importance  of  the  market  infrastructure  development,  the\nGovernment  will  put  substantial  emphasis  on  the  development  of  market  infrastructure  to\nunderpin the financial market. The Government will put the first priority in the establishment of\naccounting standards and enforcement system, which includes (i) promulgation of Law on\nCorporate Accounts, their Audit and the Accounting Profession; (ii) adoption of a sub-decree to\napply IAS/ISA to all companies incorporated in Cambodia; (iii) establishment of a National\nAccounting Council which will be in charge of setting and interpreting standards, etc.; (iv)\nadoption of official translation of IAS/ISA; (v) establishment of an association of accountants and\nauditors;  (vi)  adoption  of  a  code  of  ethics  that  complies  with  the  requirements  of  the\nInternational Federation of Accountants; and (vii) establish committees on education and ethics\nwithin the association.\n43. The Government will complete key legislation to underpin the financial sector and private\nsector development, which includes Civil Code, Law on Commercial Enterprises, Bankruptcy\nLaw, Secured Transactions Law, etc. The Government will also initiate a comprehensive judicial\nreform supported by ADB and World Bank to enhance enforcement of the law. Among these\nreform agenda, the Government is committed to adopt a Law on Commercial Enterprises and a\nSecurities and Exchange Law.\nPage 9 of 10", "58 Appendix 2, page 10\nIV.  THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S COMMITMENT AND REQUEST\n44. The  Government  with  ADB  assistance  has  established  a  long-term  vision  and\ndevelopment  strategy  for  its  nascent  financial  sector.  The  Government  believes  that  the\nBlueprint and FSDP will move the country\u2019s financial sector forward and will provide the basis\nfor the development of Cambodia's financial sector with all the associated benefits for private\nsector growth and long-term poverty reduction.\n45. The  Blueprint  has  the  highest  commitment  of  the  Government,  as  attested  by  the\nGovernment\u2019s  adoption  of  the  Blueprint  as  its  official  financial  sector  development  plan.\nFurthermore, the Government is fully committed to carry out FSDP as the core policy reform\nenvisaged in the Blueprint. In addition, the Government has established the Financial Sector\nSteering  Committee  and  Working  Group  representing  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,\nMinistry  of  Commerce,  National  Bank  of  Cambodia,  and  Council  for  the  Development  of\nCambodia.\n46. Nevertheless,  the  Government  is  fully  aware  that  this  undertaking,  although  clearly\nneeded, is fraught with difficulties and will be undertaken with limited social capital and human\nresources. It is crucial that ADB\u2019s assistance to help implement the policy reform of FSDP be\nprovided in a timely manner. With the assistance of ADB and other development partners, the\nGovernment is prepared to forge ahead.\n47. Consequently, we trust that ADB will consider favorably the Government\u2019s request for\napproval of the program loan cluster of $30 million and a loan of $10 million for Program I of the\nFSDP. We strongly urge ADB to provide further loans of $10 million each to continue policy\nreforms in Program II and III of the FSDP.\nYours sincerely,\nKeat Chhon Chea Chanto\nSenior Minister of Economy and Finance Governor\nMinistry of Economy and Finance National Bank of Cambodia\nPage 10 of 10", "POLICY MATRIX OF FINANCIAL SECTOR PROGRAM\nSUBPROGRAM I\nOBJECTIVES SUBPROGRAM II SUBPROGRAM III\n1ST TRANCHE 2ND TRANCHE\nI.

Introduction\n1. The  primary  goal  of  the  Financial  Sector  Program  Loan  (FSPL)  is  to  promote  the\ndevelopment  of  a  sound,  market-based  financial  system  to  support  enhanced  resource\nmobilization and sustainable economic growth by establishing the foundation for banking and\nthe  insurance  sector  as  well  as  financial  market  development.  This  appendix  analyzes\nCambodia\u2019s poverty profile, describes the strategy of the Government of Cambodia fighting\npoverty, and examines the impact of the FSPL on poverty reduction in Cambodia.\nB.  Poverty Profile\n2. As of 1999, Cambodia had 11.4 million people, about 84 percent of whom were in the\nrural areas. The prolonged domestic strife has caused negative population growth rate during\nthe Khmer Rouge period, but the population grew at an estimated 2.5 percent per year in the\n1990s. This resulted in a low average age, as children under 14 accounted for 43 percent of the\npopulation.\n3. With per capita gross domestic product (GDP) lingering around $260 in the 1990s,\nCambodia had an estimated poverty ratio of 36 percent as of 1999,1 and almost 90 percent of\nthe poor were in the rural areas.2 The rapidly growing population added burdens to the poor,\nand poorer households tended to have a larger share of children. The poverty rate also rose\nwith household heads\u2019 age; the rate peaked at those households with the heads in the 36-40\nyears group. In urban areas, the unemployment rate was higher, and households with female\nheads were at a disadvantage compared with those with male heads.\n4. The financial sector in Cambodia offers limited services in urban areas. The financial\nservices are confined to a small group of better-known firms and are out of the reach of most of\nthe poor population. The rural population relies on microfinance and moneylenders charging\ninterest rates as high as 10-30 percent per month.3 Even so, there exists a substantial gap in\nrural credit as the estimated rural credit demand stands at $120 million per year. The limited\nsize, location, and products of the financial institutions restrict the sector\u2019s ability to generate\nemployment. By the end of 2000, the total employees of the financial sector is around 3,300, of\nwhich 1,078 people in commercial banks, 150 in insurance companies, and around 2,100 are\nemployed in approximately 120 rural credit nongovernment organizations around the country.4\nC.  Government Strategy in Poverty Reduction\n5. Poverty reduction in Cambodia is a daunting challenge and has been a top priority target\nof  the  policy  measures.  The  Government  recognizes  that  economic  growth  and  programs\ntargeting  the  poor  are  the  two  major  driving  forces  for  poverty  reduction.  In  addition  to\nmacroeconomic stability, sustainable economic growth critically depends on efficient resource\nmobilization and allocation, which builds on governance reform, private sector development,\n                                                          \n1 The poverty line is defined, in monetary terms, as KR54,050 ($14) per person per month, or about $0.50 per day.\n2 The Ministry of Planning, Cambodia. 2000.

Impact Assessment\n1. Development of the Banking Sector\n6. Cambodia\u2019s banking sector features limited products and outreach, and a wide interest\nrate  spread.  The  high  spread  results  mainly  from  uncertainties  regarding  law/contract\nenforcement (e.g., difficulties and uncertainties in registering secured interest) and borrowers\u2019\ncreditworthiness. More than 80 percent of businesses have no access to credit, according to an\nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) survey.7 The survey also reveals that access to capital\nis the primary concern of SME managers, and that lack of access to credit has become a major\nimpediment for the private sector, especially SMEs. To improve the situation, the FSPL supports\nstrengthening  banking  supervision;  establishing  interbank/money  markets;  developing  legal,\njudiciary,  and  accounting  and  auditing  systems  and  key  information  infrastructure;  and\nreinforcing capacity-building institutions. All these efforts will reduce uncertainties and risks in\nfinancial transactions, and promote public confidence (Table A4.1).\n7. Along with governance reforms, the successful implementation of the FSPL will reduce\nthe interest rate spread, mainly by relieving uncertainties and risks stemming from lack of legal\nand financial infrastructure. Specifically, adopting a secured transactions law and establishing a\npublic registration system will reduce uncertainties related to collateral value and security. The\nestablishment of common accounting and auditing standards and enforcement mechanisms will\nreduce uncertainties related to borrower\u2019s performance and creditworthiness. In addition, the\ndevelopment of financial information infrastructure including arrangements for sharing credit\ninformation  will  reduce  information  costs  of  banks.  The  establishment  of  interbank/money\nmarkets will also reduce the operating costs of banks as liquidity management will enable them\nto reduce nonearning assets. On the other hand, together with successful bank restructuring\nprograms, strengthening the prudential regulations and supervisory capacity will enhance public\nconfidence in the banking system. This will increase deposit mobilization and further bring down\nthe bank\u2019s funding cost, and thus the interest spread. A decreased interest rate spread directly\nbenefits the poor in two ways. First, reduced uncertainties and risks will substantially tighten\ninterest rate spread, which prevents most of the population from accessing financial services.\nWith lower interest rates, the poor (who are currently excluded from banking services) will be\nable  to  access  bank  loans  and  other  services.  This  impact  of  poverty  reduction  will  be\nstrengthened as the reduced interest rate of banks will put downward pressure on the interest\nrate of microfinance providers. Second, a lower interest spread is important to the private\nsector, especially SMEs and microenterprises, as it gives many of them to access working\ncapital. Lower funding cost will enable them to cut operational cost and expand business\nopportunities. The expansion of SMEs and microenterprises will reduce poverty as most of the\nindustries are at the nascent stage and are labor-intensive.\n                                                          \n5\nGovernment  of  Cambodia.  1994.

Development of the Insurance Sector\n8. The insurance sector in Cambodia offers only a few nonlife insurance policies, and most\nof the public is outside the reach of the sector due to high premiums and limited services. Most\nof the policy purchasers are foreign companies and international organizations. Part of the\nreason  is  that  the  supervisory  system  failed  to  convince  the  public  that  the  supervisory\nauthorities oversight insurance companies. Such lack of confidence resulted in limited demand\nfor  insurance  products.  Furthermore,  a  weak  legal  framework  and  supervision  capacity\nundermines the supply of insurance products to cover diverse commercial activities. Thus, most\nbusinesses, especially SMEs, are exposed to catastrophic events. Most of the poor public and\nSMEs cannot afford to pay the currently high premiums, which are out of line with market\nequilibrium level. In fact, no one will purchase an insurance policy unless one has to. The\ncatastrophic events are particularly costly to the poor public and SMEs as Cambodia does not\nhave a social safety net.", "67 Appendix 4, page 4\nTable A4.2: Poverty Impact of the Insurance Sector Development\nMitigation\nItem Direct Effect Indirect Effect Macro\nMeasures\nLabor The private sector, especially Development of\nsmall- and medium-sized the insurance\nenterprises (SMEs), development sector will lead to\nwill be enhanced, and thus will a more balanced\ngenerate more employment and and competitive\nincome. financial structure,\nand reduce the\nPrices Market-based insurance Lower insurance premiums will\nincome fluctuation\npremiums will reflect the reduce the expenses of\nof individuals and\ndemand and supply individuals as well as the\nbusinesses, thus\nconditions, and allow the operational cost of the private\ncontributing to\npoor public and SMEs sector, including SMEs.\nmacroeconomic\nwho were previously The new insurance products will\nstability.\nunable to access enable SMEs to enlarge domestic\ninsurance products. and international business\nopportunities.\nAccess for Poor The availability of\ninsurance products and\ndiversified services will\nreduce the cost of\ncatastrophic events to\npoor and SMEs.\nTransfers Establishment of an insurance supervisory framework will promote public confidence and\nawareness of insurance and thus increase the demand for insurance. Enhanced private sector\nparticipation with a level playing field will unleash competition, resulting in market-based\npremiums.\nEstablishment of a legal framework for compulsory insurance will facilitate the introduction of\ncompulsory insurance products.\nAssumptions Full-scale governance reforms, including legal and judicial reform, and corporate governance\nreform.\nEnforcement/monitoring mechanism for compulsory insurance will be in place with supporting\nlaws.\nTotal Net Effect Positive.\n9. The FSPL targets the establishment of the basic regulatory and supervisory framework\nto build public confidence in and awareness of insurance. It also supports the development of\nan enforcement mechanism for compulsory insurance (Table A4.2). In addition, by privatizing\nthe state-owned insurance company and offering equal opportunities, the program will support\nprivate sector development. Through these policy measures, the FSPL directly supports the\ndevelopment  of  the  insurance  market  by  enlarging  the  supply  capacity  of  the  insurance\nbusiness on one hand and by creating policy-driven demand for insurance on the other hand.\n10. The establishment of the basic supervisory framework will promote public confidence\nand awareness of insurance. Once the public gains confidence in the soundness of insurance\ncompanies and the enforcement of insurance policies, the demand for insurance products will\nincrease and more diversified products will be supplied. In turn, more businesses including\nSMEs will have access to insurance products needed to protect and expand their commercial\nactivities. Moreover, the establishment of a legal framework for compulsory insurance will lay\nthe foundation for the emergence of compulsory insurance products.\n11. With equal opportunities and active private sector participation, the insurance sector will\nunleash competition to bring the premium close to a market-based level (which will reflect", "68 Appendix 4, page 5\ndemand and supply conditions). The competition will also encourage the insurance companies\nto diversify their products to meet the demands of individuals as well as businesses including\nSMEs. For example, the provision of export/import insurance will allow the expansion and\nprotection of the private sector especially SMEs. The diversified products and reduced premium\nwill increase the demand for insurance products, which will help the insurance companies to\nexpand in terms of scale and outreach. On the macro level, the expanded scale and outreach of\ninsurance companies will facilitate a more balanced and competitive financial structure, and\nsupport broad-based sustainable economic growth.\n3.

As a c stability and\nresult, the funding cost of the private sustainable\nsector, especially SMEs, will be cut down. economic\ngrowth.\nAccess for Poor The poor\u2019s access to credit and asset\naccumulation will be improved.\nTransfers The establishment of interbank/money markets will enable liquidity management,\nreduce a bank\u2019s nonearning assets, and thus operating costs. Interbank markets will\nfacilitate the integration of formal and informal sectors, and thus spread the benefit of\nreduced operating costs into the rural areas.\nAssumptions National Bank of Cambodia will develop payment and interbank clearing systems, and a regulatory\nframework to monitor and facilitate interbank/money markets activities.\nTotal Net Effect Positive\n12. Currently, Cambodia\u2019s financial sector offers only short-term bank loans at high rates.\nHigh funding cost can be attributed to the high operating cost of financial institutions. Lack of\ninterbank/money markets prevents liquidity management by financial institutions, and leads to\nexcessive nonearning assets (e.g., cash) and high operating cost. Without interbank/money\nmarkets, high funding cost and limited funding sources are expected to continue in the future,\nwhich will further widen the financing gap in both urban and rural areas. The FSPL supports the\nestablishment  of  these  markets  by  establishing  a  bankers  association  to  lay  down  the\ninstitutional basis for interbank/money markets and establishing the legal framework by adopting\na negotiable instruments law. The impact of the development of interbank/money markets on\npoverty is given in Table A4.3", "69 Appendix 4, page 6\n13. The establishment and development of interbank/money markets will reduce financial\ninstitutions\u2019 costs related to liquidity management. The spread of lending and deposit rates in\nbanks in urban areas will tighten in the short term, and the impact will increase and expand over\ntime. The development of interbank/money markets will lead to gradual integration of the formal\nand informal financial markets in both urban and rural areas, because financial institutions in\nrural areas can also participate in the interbank markets to borrow or lend to manage their\nliquidity. The integration of the formal and informal financial markets will allow the benefits of\nenhanced banking services and reduced interest rate spread to be disseminated to borrowers in\nthe rural areas as well.\n4.

The current lack of or weak financial infrastructure and safety net is the major reason for\nthe  wide  interest  rate  spread  and  nonexistence  of  many  types  of  financial  services.  In\nCambodia, many key laws to underpin commercial activities are yet to be in place, and law", "70 Appendix 4, page 7\nenforcement is yet to be strengthened. For example, lack of an enterprises law and a securities\nand exchange law precludes debt and equity financing. The situation is further compromised by\nlack  of  common  accounting  standards  and  enforcement  mechanisms.  Moreover,  lack  of  a\ndeposit insurance system further reduced public confidence in the fragile banking system.\n15. The establishment of financial infrastructure \u2013 accounting and auditing standards, the\nenforcement mechanisms, and key information infrastructure \u2013 will reduce uncertainties (and\nthus interest spread) and increase credit availability to the private sector, especially SMEs\n(Table A4.4). The establishment of a legal infrastructure, notably, the adoption of an enterprises\nlaw and a securities and exchange law along with an accounting and auditing law will provide\nthe legal basis for various funding sources. An enterprises law and a securities and exchange\nlaw will lay the foundation for companies to issue different types of corporate securities. With the\nsupport of the accounting and auditing system reform and other corporate governance reforms,\nCambodia can expect the emergence of capital markets, which will provide more funding at\nlower cost. A deposit insurance system protects small depositors from loss in the case of bank\nfailure.  It  can  promote  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  and,  in  turn,  its  resource\nmobilization capacity. More deposit means increased funding sources and fund availability to\nthe private sector, especially SMEs.\nE. Conclusion\n16. The overall benefits of the FSPL for poverty reduction can be summarized as follows:\n(i)  A well-functioning financial sector, including banks and insurance companies, will\nprovide  resources  for  real  economic  activity,  especially  for  private  sector\ndevelopment, including SMEs that will create employment opportunities.\n(ii)  A well-diversified financial sector will increase the outreach of financial services\nto rural and poor areas.\n(iii)  A well-regulated financial system will enhance public confidence in banking and,\ncapacity for resource mobilization. A sound and efficient financial system will\nfacilitate resource allocation, a prerequisite for private sector development. This\nwill support broad-based economic growth and the poverty reduction target set in\nthe Government\u2019s Socioeconomic Development Plan for 2001-2005.", "71 Appendix 5\nINELIGIBLE ITEMS\n1.
