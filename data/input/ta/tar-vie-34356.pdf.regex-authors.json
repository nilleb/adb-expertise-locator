The Government of Viet Nam has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare the Central Region Transport Network Project.1 The TA has \nbeen included in ADB\u2019s TA program for Viet Nam and the ensuing loan is in the lending pipeline. \nA TA reconnaissance mission visited Viet Nam during 28 June to 12 July 2002 and held initial \ndiscussions with the Government on the proposed scope of the TA and the proposed ensuing \nproject. Following on from these initial discussions, the TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam \nduring 16 to 27 September 2002 and reached an understanding with the Government on the \ngoals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms \nof reference for the TA.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The central region of Viet Nam consists of 18 provinces distributed among three sub-\nregions\u2013north central coast, south central coast, and central highlands. The population of the \ncentral region is approximately 22 million people comprised of 11 indigenous groups belonging \nto  3  linguistic  families,  the  Kinh,  Malayo-Polynesian,  and  Mon-Khmer.  As  shown  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy,  the  provinces \ncomprising the central region have relatively high poverty incidences. Two of these provinces are \namong the poorest in the country and nearly all have strikingly high incidences of rural poverty. \nRemoteness  and  poor  linkages  to  the  rest  of  the  economy,  including  lack  of  transport \nconnections through all-weather roads, are key factors in the incidence of poverty in the region. \nThe ADB  Country Strategy and Program Update 2003\u20132005 for Viet Nam3 focuses on the \nCentral Region and a series of projects in the agriculture, urban development, and water \nresources sectors have been targeted at the region.  \n \n3.  The transport sector in Viet Nam is dominated by the road sector but modes of transport \ninclude railways, inland waterways, coastal shipping, and aviation. Viet Nam had a road network \nof over 200,000 kilometers (km) as of 1999 and the road subsector has drawn 72% of an \nestimated $5.7 billion invested in the transport sector during 2000\u20132003. Road transport carries \nabout 70% of freight tonnage and 80% of passengers. National roads, however, account for \nmerely 15,250 km, and provincial and district roads account for 17,449 km and 36,372 km, \nrespectively.4 The entire road network is well developed but poor in quality. Only 60% of national \nroads and 27% of provincial roads are paved and the poor condition of rural roads make access \nto many villages difficult. Rural roads are the main means of access for the rural population. \n \n4.  Since the lifting of the embargo on external financing in 1993 a series of projects have \nbeen, or are being, implemented in the road subsector in Viet Nam. Initially these projects \nfocused on rehabilitating National Highway 1, which runs along the coast of Viet Nam and acts \nas the central spine for the road network. With the work on National Highway 1 drawing to a \nclose, projects have increasingly focused on other parts of the road network. ADB\u2019s Provincial \nRoads mI provement Project5 is upgrading provincial roads in 17 provinces in the northern \nuplands and Red River Delta regions. Upgrading of rural roads in 18 provinces was addressed \n                                                 \n1  Listed as the Central Region Road Sector Project. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on June 2002. \n3  ADB. 2002.

Loan 1888-VIE(SF): Provincial Roads Improvement Project. Manila. \n ", "2  \nunder ADB\u2019s Rural Infrastructure Sector Project6 and rural roads are being improved in 40 \nprovinces across the country with funding from the World Bank and Department for International \nDevelopment (DFID) under the rural transport 1 (RT1) and rural transport 2 (RT2) projects. The \nCentral Region needs better connection of rural areas to the provincial and national road \nnetworks7 and improvement of the national and provincial roads themselves. \n \n5.  Responsibility for administering the national road network is shared between the Viet \nNam Road Administration (VRA) and the provinces. VRA\u2019s responsibilities are limited to the \nnational highways; the maintenance of provincial and district roads is the responsibility of the \nprovinces. VRA has received capacity building and training funded by ADB, under the 1st, 2nd, \nand 3rd road improvement projects,8 and under various interventions by World Bank and other \ndonors. Under the World Bank/DFID-financed RT1 and RT2 projects, support is being given to \nbuild capacity at the provincial level for rural roads. Capacity at the provincial level for road \nsector  administration  and  maintenance  is  weak.  In  the  Central  Region,  the  demand  for \nrehabilitation and maintenance outstrips the capacity of the provincial authorities9 and there is a \nneed to strengthen management systems, particularly maintenance management systems. \n \n6.  Geographical remoteness and disconnection from the rest of the economy is a key cause \nof poverty in areas where the poor have not been able to capture the benefits of economic \ngrowth. To overcome this restraint requires that all the links between communities and markets \nare present. Thus, upgrading of one link in a road network should not be considered in isolation \nfrom its place in a series of links from communities to the rest of the economy and vice versa. \nClearly a single project cannot address all linkages in a network but if a particular link is to be \nupgraded then consideration must be given to the condition of the links within the subnetwork to \nwhich the link is directly connected. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The TA will assist the Government to implement its poverty reduction strategy and \nstimulate economic growth by helping to prepare a project to improve the road transport network \nin the central region of Viet Nam. The proposed project will reduce poverty and enhance \neconomic development in poor provinces by improving (i) critical national, provincial, and district \nroad links; and (ii) the management of the provincial road networks.   \n \n8.  The  outputs  from  the  TA  will  be  (i)  an  assessment  of  the  institutional  capacity  of \nprovincial governments within the central region and proposals to strengthen the provincial road \nsector institutions, particularly with respect to maintenance of road assets; (ii) an institutional \ndevelopment strategy for the provincial authorities to administer the road network in an efficient, \neffective, and sustainable manner; (iii) socioeconomic data on the central region to evaluate the \nproposed project\u2019s economic viability and poverty impact; (iv) ranking of proposed subprojects \nand packaging them for implementation under a sector loan modality; (v) an analysis that \ndemonstrates that the selected subprojects for the core subprojects under the first phase of the \n                                                 \n6   ADB. 1997.

Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  TA  will  consist  of  a  subsector  review  component  and  a  project  preparation \ncomponent.  The  two  components  will  be  implemented  concurrently.  The  subsector  review \ncomponent will address administration of the road subsector at the provincial level and will \ncomprise (i) reviewing the current status of policy reform in the road subsector to provide the \nbasis for further policy dialogue; (ii) preparing an institutional development strategy for the \nprovincial authorities to administer the road network in an efficient, effective, and sustainable \nmanner based on an evaluation of their capacity and capabilities; and (iii) preparing a strategy to \nimprove  the  planning,  budgeting,  and  implementation  of  maintenance  of  provincial  roads, \nincluding an assessment of the potential for the involvement of the private sector in road \nmaintenance. This work will draw on existing and ongoing studies funded by ADB10 and World \nBank.11 \n \n10.  Project  Management  Unit  No.  1  (PMU-1)  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT),  has \nproposed a list of 239 subprojects covering 3,225 km of road improvement works and 9,568 km \nof bridge improvement works in 17 provinces12 in the central region. Most of the subprojects are \nfor provincial roads, the remainder are for district roads. PMU-1 has estimated the cost of \nimplementing the subprojects at $239 million. This list of subprojects will be the basis for the \nservices under the project preparation component of this TA. A summary of initial poverty and \nsocial analysis is in Appendix 1. \n \n11.  The  project  preparation  component  will  commence  with  a  survey  that  will  include  \n(i) a review of recently completed, ongoing, or proposed physical infrastructure and social and \neconomic development projects in the central region;13 (ii) an inventory and condition survey of \nthe selected roads to be used as a basis for feasibility studies to determine improvement \nrequirements and standards; (iii) an assessment of the road network linking to each selected \nroad; and (iv) environmental, poverty, and social impact assessments. The purpose of the \nassessment of road network links is to ensure that (i) the selected road is connected to the \nnational network (connecting roads) at a standard consistent with that proposed for the selected \nroad; and (ii) roads extending out from the selected road to communities (community roads) are \nof a standard that allows these communities to access the selected road. The required standard \nfor community roads, which may be district or commune roads, will be maintainable all weather \naccess. If upgrading work is required for a connecting or community road this road will be \nincluded as a new subproject. However, the intent is that where upgrading of community roads is \nrequired but is only economically justified to an unsealed standard then this upgrading will be \nadopted under the provincial government\u2019s own works program. The consultants will confirm that \nbudget is available and that these works have been included in the provincial government\u2019s work \nprogram. \n \n                                                 \n10 For example, Booz-Allen Hamilton. 2002.

The subprojects will be ranked and packaged as a series of phases. The subprojects \nunder the first phase, the core subprojects, will be fully prepared under the TA and subsequent \nphases will be addressed on a sector basis under an ensuing investment project that may be \nfinanced from one or more loans. Packaging of the subprojects will take into account logistical \nconsiderations for implementing the investment project, for example, addressing all subprojects \nwithin a limited number of provinces under each phase. Detailed preparation work for the core \nsubprojects will include (i) a resettlement plan; (ii) an indigenous peoples action plan, if required; \n(iii)  an  initial  environmental  examination,  and,  if  necessary,  an  environmental  impact \nassessment; (iv) poverty and gender profiles for peoples traversed; (iv) social and economical \njustification based on a list of improvement options; and (iv) bidding documents. In addition, the \nTA will (i) prepare and implement a training program for the central Government and provincial \nauthorities  in  project  identification,  preparation,  implementation,  and  administration;  and  \n(ii) prepare generic designs and documentation to be applied to selected roads. \n \n13.  All data gathered during the implementation of the TA will be collated and stored using \ngeographic information systems (GIS) software. The design of the underlying databases and the \ntype of software will be consistent with that being used on the ongoing RT2 project. A copy of the \nGIS database developed under the RT2 project will be made available to the consultants by \nDFID. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.25 million equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange cost is $633,800 and the local currency cost is $616,200 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $1.00 million equivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange \ncost and a portion of the local currency cost amounting to $366,200 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment will finance the remaining $250,000 equivalent of local currency costs through  \nin-kind contributions of the executing agency and provincial counterpart staff; office space, \ntransport, and local communications for the counterpart staff; and maps, reports, and other \ninformation. Detailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 2. The Government has been \nadvised that ADB\u2019s approval of the TA does not commit the ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOT will be the executing agency for the TA, MOT has designated PMU-1  as  the \nimplementing agency. The general director of PMU-1 will have overall responsibility for its \ncontribution to the TA, and will set up a subunit suitably staffed with counterpart personnel for \nday-to-day  coordination  and  to  work  with  the  TA  consultant\u2019s  personnel  as  well  as  other \ngovernment  agencies,  particularly  the  provincial  departments  of  transport,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and other interested parties. To oversee the TA implementation, MOT will \nestablish  a  steering  committee  comprising  representatives  from  other  ministries,  provincial \ngovernments, and government agencies and chaired by a senior official of MOT. \n \n16.  The TA will require about 148 person-months of consulting services, including about 23 \nperson-months of international and 125 person-months of domestic consultants. The TA will be \nimplemented over a 10 month period commencing in July 2003. Outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix  3. Reporting requirements include the submission of inception, interim, and final \nreports, and brief progress reports on a monthly basis. Tripartite meetings will be held after the \nsubmission of the inception, interim, and draft final reports. A workshop will be held after \nsubmission of the draft final report to present the project to the Government, NGOs, and other ", "      5\nstakeholders.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  transport  planning  and \neconomics,  highway  design  and  maintenance,  bridge  maintenance,  environmental  impact \nassessment, resettlement, social issues, and institutional development. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with its  Guidelines on the Use  of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Consultants will \nbe  recruited  using  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  procedures;  simplified  technical \nproposals  will  be  requested.  Equipment  to  be  financed  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to the Government \nof Viet Nam for preparing the Central Region Transport Network Project, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.  \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in  Yes  Sector identified as a national priority in  Yes \ncountry poverty analysis?  country poverty partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam:  \nViet Nam\u2019s impressive economic growth during the 1990s has been strongly pro-poor. With only marginal increases \nin inequality, the proportion of people living below the total poverty line has dropped from 58% in 1993 to 37% in \n1998. The proportion living below the food poverty line also declined from 25% to 15%, indicating that even the \npoorest segments of the population have benefited from economic growth. However, the poverty incidence in Viet \nNam is still high and remains as a rural phenomenon with 45% of the rural population living in poverty. To support the \nGovernment in pursuing a balanced economic growth the Country Strategy and Program Update 2003\u20132005 for Viet \nNam and the poverty partnership agreement between Viet Nam and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) emphasize \nregional development through geographical focus on the central region. The central region comprises provinces with \nrelatively high poverty incidences, two of which are amongst the poorest in the country. Nearly all provinces have \nstrikingly high rural incidences of poverty. This suggests that geographical remoteness and disconnection from the \nrest of the economy are among the key factors for explaining poverty.  \n \nRemoteness translates into higher input costs, and high transactions costs for bringing goods to the market and is a \nbarrier for school attendance and health care. Studies show that the burden of inaccessibility falls on women. Rural \ntransport infrastructure is important for improving connectivity and lifting underlying barriers for poverty reduction.  \nThis infrastructure comprises networks of commune and district roads linking into larger networks of provincial and \nnational roads. Provincial roads form an important link between \u201clower level\u201d infrastructure and \u201cupper level\u201d national \nnetworks. Connectivity is a key factor for enabling the poor to respond to market incentives and participate in \neconomic growth. A recent study1 shows that ethnic minorities living in poverty in remote and access-deprived areas \nhave not been able to benefit from economic growth. Remoteness and disconnection has been identified as the key \nfactors for the inability of ethnic minorities to benefit and has led to low returns to both capital and human \nendowments. Improved transport infrastructure will contribute to a regionally balanced and equitable economic \ngrowth by stimulating agricultural production and access to employment opportunities and facilitating access to social \nservices. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nThe poverty analysis to be undertaken in the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Central Region \nTransport Network Project will focus on the impact of road network improvements on social service delivery, \nmovement of goods and people, and their impact on poverty. It will include an assessment of the ability of the poor to \nbenefit from resulting economic activities and a review of barriers that might prevent the poor from benefiting from \neconomic growth. The poverty analysis will include the role of provincial roads in interlinking targeted community and \ndistrict roads with the larger national network and the extent to which the mobility of the poor can be improved by \nincreased access and by what means. The economic analyses of subprojects and extended networks will include \nindividual distributional analysis between stakeholders, including the poor. A poverty impact ratio will be calculated for \neach subproject and for the first phase of identified subprojects. \n \nThe core analysis will be based on existing data such as the census, national socioeconomic surveys with poverty \nindicators and the poverty database developed by the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MOLSA). The study will \nuse existing surveys and reports to the extent possible. The consultants will coordinate work with the Rural Transport \nProject 2 (RT2) funded by the World Bank and the Department for International Development. Additional quick rural \nappraisals and key informant interviews can take place after data and information gaps for conducting the analysis \nhave been identified. Provincial data on education and health will be collected to analyze the effect of road conditions \nand accessibility on social services. If data availability allows, it will include an assessment of the impact of road \nconditions on cost efficiency of social services delivery across provinces in the central region. The poverty analysis \nwill use the findings of a forthcoming ADB technical assistance (TA) on transport service networks for the poor, which \nfocuses on transport services in two provinces in the central region, if these findings are available in sufficient time. \n \n                                                 \n1 Baulch, Bob, Chuyen Troung Thi Kim, Haughton Dominique, and Jonathan Haughton. 2002.

Participation Process \nStakeholder Analysis:  \n \nDuring preparation of the resettlement plan for each core road, all affected households will be surveyed and will \nparticipate in the inventory of assets, identification of compensation and resettlement preferences, and a replacement \ncost study.  Affected communities will also be required to participate in preparation of the ethnic minority development \nplans and gender strategy. \n \nParticipation strategy required:  \n \nYes, participation strategy will be required in the resettlement plan and the ethnic minority development plan to \nensure the plans are culturally appropriate and implementable. \n \nD.

Initial assessments under this \ncomponent will be undertaken for the region as a whole; more detailed assessments will focus \non provinces to be included in phase 1, the core subprojects, of a proposed ensuing investment \nproject. In relation to the objective and scope of the TA, the consultants' scope of work will \ninclude, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: \n \n(i)  Undertake a transport sector profile for the central region. The profile should \nreview transport planning and coordination, the road network, the vehicle fleet \nand traffic, the relationship between roads and poverty, environmental issues, \nroad sector expenditures and revenues, maintenance arrangements, road safety, \nand axle load control. \n \n(ii)  Prepare an institutional development strategy for the provincial authorities to \nadminister the road network in an efficient, effective, and sustainable manner \nbased on an evaluation of their capacity and capabilities. Prepare a training \nneeds assessment to address weaknesses in administrative, managerial, and \ntechnical skills.  Based on the strategy, recommend a project implementation \nstructure  that  will  allow  any  subsequent  project  to  be  effectively  prepared, \nmanaged, and implemented.  Assess the capacity of responsible institutions at \ncentral and provincial levels to plan, manage, implement, finance, and monitor \neffective land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement and identify capacity \nbuilding measures to be included in the project.  Define project implementation \narrangements, demonstrate the relationship between relevant institutions, and \nindicate  the  responsibilities  of  each  unit  in  a  participatory  implementation \nframework. \n \n(iii)  Prepare a strategy to improve the planning, budgeting, and implementation of \nmaintenance of provincial and district roads, including an assessment of the \npotential for the involvement of the private sector in road maintenance. This work \nwill draw on, and be consistent with, the work being undertaken under the Rural \nTransport 2 (RT2) Project funded by the World Bank and the Department for \nInternational  Development  (DFID)  funded  regarding  capacity  building  for \nmaintenance  of  rural  roads  under  provincial  governments.  Review  the  fiscal \nbudgetary allocations of provincial governments including those for maintenance \nand investments for transport project. \n \n                                                 \n1  For example, Booz-Allen Hamilton. 2002.  Improvement of Highway Management Capacity of the Ministry of \nTransport, and Implementation of Sector Development Policy. Hanoi, Vietnam: Ministry of Transport. ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n(iv)  Analyze the contractors available in the central region in terms of numbers, \ncapability, resources, etc., and develop an approach to effectively involve these \ncontractors in a subsequent project. \n \nB.  Project Preparation Component \n3.  In relation to the objective and scope of the TA, the consultants' scope of work will \ninclude, but not necessarily be limited to, the items in paragraphs 4\u20136. \n \n4.  For data gathering and project  assessments, the consultants will do the following: \n(i)  Based on the geographic information system (GIS) databases prepared under the \nRT2 project, design a data collection system to input into these existing GIS \ndatabases  information  for  the  proposed  project.  The  new  data  should  be \ncompatible with existing data, particularly that associated with poverty mapping. \nThe consultant will be expected to work closely with the RT2 consultant for this \nwork. \n \n(ii)  A list of subprojects to be addressed under this TA has been agreed between the \nMinistry of Transport  (MOT) and ADB and will be provided to the consultant. \nEach subproject, as listed by the MOT, consists of a single road, a section of a \nroad, or an individual bridge. Assess each subproject\u2019s, connections with (a) the \nnational and provincial road network (connection roads), and (b) the communities \nthat will use the subproject to access the national and provincial road network \n(community  roads).  The  combination  of  each  subproject  and  its  associated \nconnection and community roads will be termed the subproject network. When \nupgrading work is required for a connecting or community road, this road will be \nincluded  as  new  subproject.  However,  if  upgrading  of  community  roads  is \nrequired but is only economically justified to an unsealed standard, then the \nupgrading will be adopted under the provincial government\u2019s own works program. \nWhere this applies, confirm that budget is available and that the works have been \nincluded in the provincial government\u2019s work program. \n \n(iii)  Review TA and physical infrastructure, social and economic development projects \nrecently completed, under way, or proposed in the selected provinces. Include all \nsources of assistance both external and internal.  \n \n(iv)  Assess  the  environmental  impact  of  each  subproject.  Clearly  identify  any \nsubproject that may impact on ecologically sensitive areas or sites of cultural or \nhistorical significance. \n \n(v)  Investigate the extent of unexploded ordnance (UXO) contamination in the project \narea and determine the extent, if any, of clearance that will be required under the \nproject. Prepare documentation and cost estimates to implement such clearance \nunder the project. \n \n(vi)  Categorize and prioritize the subprojects using a simple computer spreadsheet \nbased on a screening analysis and taking into account traffic and potential vehicle \noperating cost savings, influence area development potential, population density, \nimprovement cost, environmental, social, and other relevant factors. Based on a \nsample  of  typical  sections  representing  the  major  social  and  economic \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \ncharacteristics and terrain and soil types in the study area, prepare a detailed \neconomic evaluation of the needed improvements. Sample subprojects for this \npurpose should be of a wide enough variety that a list of economically justified \nimprovement options can be prepared and applied to all subprojects throughout \nthe study area. This list will show, using a multidimensional matrix, the level of \nimprovement that meets an economic rate of return of at least 12%. Prepare a \nsocial ni dex to identify and help prioritize roadwork improvements. This work \nshould  be  based  on  the  analysis  approach  and  matrix  developed  under  \nTA 3455-VIE: Viet Nam Provincial Roads Improvement Project. \n \n(vii)  Based on a socioeconomic survey, prepare traffic forecasts by representative \ntraffic  types  taking  into  account  population  growth,  production  increases, \neconomic activity, and income. The forecasts should be developed in sufficient \ndetail that they can be applied to each subproject to be considered under the \nstudy.  \n \n(viii)  Based on the results of engineering investigations, prepare preliminary designs, \nconstruction  quantities,  and  overall  construction  costs  for  each  project  road \nsection for each improvement option. The costs should be broken down into \nforeign exchange, local currency, and tax components. Indicate direct and indirect \nforeign exchange separately. \n \n(ix)  Calculate economic vehicle operating costs for each subproject with and without \nthe  proposed  improvements,  based  on  estimated  changes  in  road  surface \nroughness, and quantify the benefits (using shadow prices) for each project road \nsection and for each improvement option, including benefits in terms of time \nsavings  generated  from  reduced  congestion  and  travel  distance,  road \nmaintenance savings, traffic accidents, etc.  \n \n(x)  Conduct an economic and distributional evaluation of all subprojects, individually \nand  jointly,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Economic  Analysis  of \nProjects  by  comparing  with  and  without  subproject  cases.  Identify  risks  and \nundertake appropriate risk and sensitivity analysis of the economic internal rate of \nreturn , in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Risk Analysis in the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. In addition, prepare an economic and distribution \nanalysis for each subproject network. \n \n(xi)  Based on item  (x), conduct a distributional analysis of net project benefits in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis and Handbook \nfor Integrating Poverty Impact in Economic Analysis of Projects. Calculate the \npoverty impact ratio and the cost effectiveness of the project of reducing poverty. \nAssess  the  change  in  impact  if  the  analysis  is  performed  at  the  subproject \nnetworks level. Undertake appropriate risk and sensitivity analysis of the poverty \nimpact ratio. \n \n(xii)  Review data on poverty and prepare a poverty and stakeholder profile for each of \nthe sample subprojects in item (vi). Prepare a poverty analysis focusing on the \nimpact of road network improvements on social service delivery and movement of \ngoods and people, and their impact on poverty and employment. Include an \nassessment of the ability of the poor to benefit from resulting economic activities \nand  examine  the  barriers  that  could  prevent  the  poor  from  benefiting  from ", "  Appendix 3  13 \neconomic  growth.  The  poverty  analysis  will  make  use  of  the  findings  of  a \nforthcoming TA on transport service networks for the poor, which will focus on \ntransport services in two provinces in the central region, if these findings are \navailable. Summarize findings on impacts, risks, and barriers and include the \nchannels through which impacts occur in a matrix form. \n \n(xiii)  Evaluate the likely social impact of the proposed project, particularly the potential \nfor  indigenous  peoples  or  other  vulnerable  groups  to  be  significantly  and \nadversely  affected.  Describe  the  social  justification  of  the  proposed  project. \nPrepare a gender strategy to provide women of poor rural and ethnic minorities, \nincreased  opportunities  to  learn  new  skills  and  decision-making,  and  take \nadvantage of new employment and income generating opportunities. Assess the \nrisk  of  spreading  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immune  deficiency \nsyndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  and  other  sexually  transmitted  diseases  (STDs)  and \ntrafficking of women and children. Identify existing or planned programs of the \nGovernment, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other agencies. Design \nappropriate mitigation measures, and include cost estimates and implementation \narrangements. \n \n(xiv)  Assess land issues, titles, and the potential impact of in-migration on the land use \nrights  of  the  communities  along  the  roads.  Identify  means  of  protecting  the  \nland-use rights of the communities along the roads. \n \n5.  For selection of core subprojects and detailed project preparation, the consultants will do \nthe following: \n(i)  Based on the provincial road inventory, and consultations with local stakeholders \nand NGOs, and the results of the economic analysis, prepare a list of subprojects \nby  priority  to  be  improved,  warranted  improvement  options,  and  estimated \nimprovement  costs.  Package  the  subprojects  into  a  series  of  phases  to  be \nimplemented under an investment project that may be financed from one or more \nloans. Subproject roads for the first phase, the core subprojects, will be selected, \nanalyzed, and prepared in full for implementation under subsequent financing. \nThis work will include preparation of detailed cost estimates with subdivided \nforeign  exchange  cost,  local  currency  costs,  and  customs  duties  and  taxes, \nprequalification documents, and tender documents. \n \n(ii)  For  the  core  subprojects  prepare  an  initial  environmental  examination,  and \nsummary  thereof,  following  ADB's  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected \nInfrastructure Projects and other environmental assessment requirements. The \nexamination will identify environmentally sensitive areas and receptors in the \nproject areas, assess potential environmental impacts, propose environmental \nmitigation  measures  and  a  management  plan,  identify  environmental \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  institutional  arrangements  in  terms  of  road \nimprovements and management, and recommend whether there is a need for an \nenvironmental impact assessment. Prepare an environmental impact assessment \nwhen needed. \n \n(iii)  Identify and prepare socioeconomic profiles of the project affected communities in \nterms  of  household  sizes,  demographic  trends,  income  sources  and  levels, \noccupations, socioeconomic conditions, social service infrastructure, and social \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \norganizations. Prepare the profiles in accordance with (a) relevant ADB guidelines \nand publications, including  Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis (2001), \nHandbook on Resettlement (1998), and  Handbook for Incorporation of Social \nDimensions in Projects (1994); and (b) the requirements of Viet Nam. The profiles \nwill include the gender and local ethnic minority profiles. Carry out any further \nsurveys as necessary. \n \n(iv)  For core subprojects, undertake social analysis as per the guidelines in (iii) and \nADB's Policies on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), Indigenous Peoples (1999), \nand  Gender  and  Development  (1998).  Identify  the  affected  populations  and \nprincipal  beneficiaries  of  the  project.  Implementable  resettlement  plans  and \nframeworks should be prepared as per ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \nand Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. Preparation should \ninvolve full stakeholder participation including participation of the executing and \nimplementing agencies. Assist the executing agency to prepare an information \nbrochure to be distributed to affected people.  \n \n(v)  Investigate aspects of provincial road safety and include them in the designs, as \nappropriate. Make recommendations for improving safety on the study roads. \n \n(vi)  Review and update the approach prepared under the ADB Provincial Roads \nProject for providing low-cost, all-weather pavement for all provincial and district \nroads.  Based  on  these  approaches,  prepare  technical  specifications  for  the \nimprovement works. \n \n(vii)  Prepare sample contract documents, specifications, and cost estimates for typical \nimprovement contracts, all documents being as simple as possible. Standardize \ncontract documents have been adopted in Viet Nam. Therefore, for contracts to \nbe procured by local competitive bidding, the bidding documents should follow the \nagreed  formats  used  under  other  projects.  Refer  to  the  documents  and \nspecifications prepared for the World Bank-financed rural transport 1 and rural \ntransport 2 projects, and the ADB-financed provincial road improvement project. \nAlso refer to World Bank's sample bidding documents prepared in Vietnamese. \nFor contracts to be bid by international competitive bidding, documentation must \nfollow the ADB\u2019s Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Civil Works. \n \n6.  For preparation of implementation documentation, the consultants will do the following: \n(i)  Prepare manuals for project identification, preparation, management, technical \naspects of road construction, procurement, and other relevant activities. The \nmanuals should be based on a similar manual prepared under ADB\u2019s Provincial \nRoads Improvement Project but revised to incorporate lessons learned during the \nimplementation of this project. Prepare a training program to be implemented at \nthe central and provincial level on these and other relevant subjects. \n \n(ii)  Design a project performance management system in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines. Provide cost estimates and implementation arrangements. \n \n(iii)  Prepare prefeasibility and feasibility reports for submission to the Government of \nViet Nam that met the requirements of Decree No. 52/CP.
