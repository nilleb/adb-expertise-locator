The  long-term  strategic  framework  and  poverty  reduction  strategy  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) require ADB to promote environmentally sustainable development in \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs).  To  effectively  implement  these  strategies,  ADB\u2019s \nrecently  approved  Environment  Policy1 emphasizes  the  need  to  mainstream  environmental \nconsiderations in economic growth in the DMCs and requires environmental concerns to be \nintegrated into all stages of ADB business processes. A key to ensure this important transition is \nthe country environmental analysis (CEA), to be undertaken as part of the country strategy and \nprogram  (CSP)  preparation.  This  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)2 aims  to  assist  the \ngovernments of DMCs covered by the East and Central Asia Department (ECRD) (para. 13) to \nintensify the level of integration of environmental considerations into development planning \nprocess through the preparation of CEAs. The TA framework summarizing the objectives, goals, \nscope, inputs, outputs, and performance targets is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The unique natural resources are significant assets, and sustainable use of these natural \nresources is an essential part of long-term development in the five Central Asia republics \n(CARs),  Azerbaijan,  and  Mongolia.  However,  the  natural  resources  assets  were  poorly \nmanaged  during  the  former  Soviet  Union  period,  and  environmental  degradation  in  these \ncountries  has  not  been  reversed  during  the  transitional  period  of  the  last  decade.  Land \ndegradation associated with inappropriate agricultural activities is widespread and worsening in \nsome areas, resulting in reduced productivity of farmlands and grasslands. Transboundary \nwater resource management problems have increasingly become a constraint to national and \nregional  economic  development,  and  water  quality  deterioration  has  contributed  to  the \noutbreaks of waterborne diseases. As industrialization continues, industrial pollution is expected \nto become more pervasive and more costly to control, especially for small- and medium-sized \nenterprises; and new pollutions from vehicle emissions, solid wastes, and municipal wastewater \ndue to accelerating urbanization have increasingly created unfavorable living conditions and \nthreatened  the  health  of  urban  populations.  The  annual  economic  loss  attributable  to \nenvironmental degradation in these countries is estimated between 4-8% of gross domestic \nproduct,  indicating  that  economic  growth  since  late  1990s  could  be  compromised  if  the \neconomic costs of environmental damages are considered.  \n \n3.  The  governments  of  CARs,  Azerbaijan,  and  Mongolia  realize  these  environmental \nproblems  and  are  committed  to  environmentally  sustainable  development.  They  have  also \nrealized there is a significant gap between the goal of environmentally sustainable development \nand the mechanisms that they currently have to reach this goal. The key constraints to effective \nenvironmental management include inadequate legal frameworks and regulation systems, lack \nof  market-based  policies,  fragmented  institutional  and  financial  mechanisms,  and  weak \nenforcement.  Lack of integration of environmental and economic policies and plans is the most \nimportant constraint to establishing an effective system of environmental management in these \ncountries.  Environment  policies  and  plans  are  often  still  considered  to  be  self-contained \nactivities  or  an  add-on  by  decision-makers  in  economic  development  departments  and, \nsometimes, even in environmental protection agencies. Macro-level  economic  and financial \npolicies often do not encourage sustainable use of natural resources and provide incentives to \nnot  comply  with  environmental  requirements.  For  example,  market  prices  and  perverse \n                                                 \n1\n ADB. 2002.  Environmental Policy of the Asian Development Bank.  \n2\n The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities  (Internet version) on 8 January 2003. ", "2 \nsubsidies do not reflect the value of environmental resources (such as water, land, and air), and \nthus encourage overuse of natural resources and polluting management practices. Economic \ndevelopment  policies  and  plans  developed  by  the  key  economic  agencies  are  often  not \nreviewed and assessed by environmental protection agencies, and as a result, environmental \nsustainability  is  often  left  out  of  key  economic  planning  criteria.  Poor  institutional  linkages \nbetween the economic planning and environmental protection agencies are due, partly, to the \nlack of reliable information and data collection systems and capacities that allow accurate and \ncomprehensive  analysis  of  environmental  impacts  and  implications  of  national  and  sector \npolicies and programs.  \n \n4.  The governments of these countries have increasingly realized that, as an issue that \ncuts  across  sectoral  responsibilities,  the  goals  of  environmental  management  cannot  be \nachieved by the environmental protection agencies alone; and that effective environmental \nmanagement requires that environmentally sustainable development be mainstreamed into the \noperation of the government as a whole. ADB\u2019s new Environmental Policy recognizes the need3 \nto intensify the level of integration of environmental considerations in DMCs\u2019 strategy and \nplanning formation processes, and directs ADB\u2019s operational priority to help DMCs formulate \ndevelopment strategies and priorities in close linkage with key environmental considerations, i.e.,  \nto mainstream environmental considerations in the economic and socioeconomic development \nprocess. Accordingly, as part of the country CSP preparation, the CEA, a comprehensive, \ncountry-level diagnostic environmental analysis, is now required based on systematic collection \nand analysis of environmental information, and identification of key areas of intervention and \ncapacity building. The CEA will (i) analyze information about key environmental issues, (ii) \nhighlight the environmental implications of key development policies, (iii) evaluate the country\u2019s \nenvironmental capacity, (iv) review and assess ADB and other development partners\u2019 past \nenvironmental assistance, and (v) recommend ADB\u2019s assistance and partnerships. The CEA \nprovides the opportunity of bridging environmental, economic, and other sectoral work and \nfacilitates  a  dialogue  with  key  stakeholders  in  each  country  and  coordination  among \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n5.  Improved environmental and natural resource management is essential for achieving the \noverarching goal of poverty reduction and sustainable growth for all DMCs, but in the CARs, \nAzerbaijan, and Mongolia, implementing this thrust is particularly urgent. Since the 1990s, ADB \nhas provided a series of TAs and studies addressing environmental issues in these countries, \nwith focuses on capacity building, development of environmental plans, and environmental \nprofile,4 and the CEA process will build on the results of theses earlier efforts. The past ADB \n                                                 \n3\n Other key funding agencies, such as the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nhave also developed their environmental policies in recent years to address this need.  \n4\n ADB. 1999.

Other  stakeholders \noutside the domain of environmental agencies, notably economic planning agencies, are often \nexcluded. One lesson learned is that assistance in capacity building is more effective if it is \nprovided based on a broader and systematic analysis of environment aspects of development, \nincluding  environmental  implications  of  economic  policies  and  reforms,  environmental \nchallenges, and the capacity of the government as a whole to address the challenges in the \ncontext of sustainable growth. ADB\u2019s new Environment Policy clearly requires ADB to expand \nthe  scope  of  environmental  assistance,  and  bring  the  environmental  considerations  into  a \nproper perspective  in relation to macroeconomic policies and key sectoral plans.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n6.  The TA is a part of ADB\u2019s move to achieve its strategic goal to help the governments of \nCARs,  Azerbaijan,  and  Mongolia  integrate  sustainable  management  of  environmental  and \nnatural resources in the economic and social development planning process at the national \nlevel. The main objectives of the TA are to help the governments (i) develop and disseminate an \naccurate and comprehensive understanding of the national environmental management regimes \namong  the  wide  range  of  policy  makers  and  development  planners,  with  clear  contextual \nlinkages to the national economic development goals; and (ii) identify priority areas in policy, \ninstitutional,  and  legislative  mechanisms,  and  programs/projects  that  will  improve  synergy \nbetween environmental/natural resources management and national economic development \nplanning, including  planned and potential support from ADB. \n \n7.  To meet the objectives, the TA will produce a set of specific outputs and deliverables:  (i) \nGreater and clearer awareness and better understanding among national level policy-making \nand  economic  planning  authorities  about  the  key  environmental  and  natural  resources \nmanagement issues and their linkage with macro-level economic and social development plans. \n(ii)  A  comprehensive  CEA  report  for  each  CAR,  Azerbaijan,  and  Mongolia,  covering  key \nenvironmental  challenges,  environmental  implications  of  main  development  policies,  the \ncountry\u2019s capacity to deal with the challenges, ADB and other key agencies\u2019 past environmental \nassistance  and  effectiveness,  and  recommended  ADB  assistance  and  partnerships.  A \nframework of follow-on initiatives and actions in key sectors to improve synergy and integration \nof environmental consideration will be developed to guide ADB\u2019s assistance. (iii) A substantial \ninput to CSPs, allowing these programming processes to integrate environmental management \nas a key element in development planning. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The main activities of the TA include (i) compilation and analysis of basic information on \nthe state of environment and environmental management regime, including key environmental \nand sustainability indicators, environmental trends, links of environmental quality with economic \n                                                 \n \nCentral Asia.

An important means of enhancing country ownership of the CEA and its findings is to \ninvolve all key national stakeholders in each stage of CEA preparation. The CEA preparation \nwill  adopt  a  participatory  approach;  the  analyses  and  assessment  work  will  be  conducted \nthrough  reviewing  documents  inside  and  outside  the  governments,  and  dialogue  through \ninterviews  and  meetings  with  all  the  key  stakeholders  including  national  experts, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), private sector representatives, officials of governments \nfrom economic development departments as well as environmental agencies, and other funding \nagencies.  \n \n10.  A national consultation workshop will be held in each participating DMC to share the \nfindings of the TA, review the CEA report, and seek consensus on the identified priority areas \nand follow-up initiatives to mainstream the concept of environmental sustainable development, \nand ADB\u2019s role. Representatives of all key stakeholders will participate in the workshop. \n \n11.  Coordination  and  demarcation  with  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment  (EBRD),  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  United  Nations \nEnvironment Programme (UNEP), and World Bank (WB) is important for the TA.  ADB, EBRD, \nUNEP, and WB are each carrying out environmental analyses as part of their strategies and \nprogram development for CARs, Azerbaijan, and Mongolia.  ADB, EBRD, UNEP, and WB have \nagreed to cooperate, particularly in sharing of background information, considering the need to \nhave a similar information base. There is also a need to coordinate data analysis and strategy \ndevelopment  to  avoid  conflicting  or  redundant  programs.  However,  each  agency  needs  to \ndevelop independently its strategy and programs that set out specific follow-up activities, based \non the agency\u2019s unique mandates and portfolios. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $550,000 equivalent consisting entirely of foreign \nexchange. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. Cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The countries to be involved in the TA are Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nMongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. CEAs will be prepared for Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan in 2003, and for Azerbaijan, Mongolia, Turkmenistan, and \nUzbekistan in 2004, in accordance with the timetable of CSP preparation for each country. \n ", "    5 \n14.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Agriculture, Environment, and Natural \nResources  Division  of  ECRD  will  administer  and  supervise  the  TA.  ADB  environmental \nspecialists in ECRD will review the reports prepared by the consultants, discuss CEAs and other \nreports with key stakeholders through CSP missions and the workshops, and finalize the CEAs. \nADB will coordinate with EBRD, UNDP, UNEP, and WB for information exchange, and discuss \nthe analysis results of CEAs through CSP missions and the national workshops. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented in close cooperation with the national governments. As the \nnational partner agency, the ministry of environment in each country (or another national agency \nas assigned by the government) will be responsible for communication and coordination among \nrelated ministries and departments. The governments of participating countries will (i) suggest \nlocal consultants for ADB\u2019s consideration; (ii) assist as necessary the consultants engaged by \nADB in the provision of their services under the TA, and make available, free of charge, all \nrelevant documents, data statistics, and maps; and (iv) assure that representatives from the key \neconomic planning departments (such as ministries of finance, economic development, energy, \nwater resources, agriculture, and health, and other related agencies) as well as environment \nagencies will participate in the workshops under the TA. \n \n16.  Two  international  consultants  will  be  recruited  on  an  individual  basis.  The  TA \nimplementation  will  require  14  person-months  of  international  and  50  person-months  of \ndomestic  consultants  including  a  TA  project  assistant  for  10  person-months  at  ADB \nheadquarters. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The international consultants will have substantial experience in environmental \neconomics and environmental management, including prior experience in the countries included \nin the TA. Completion of the TA will take 22 months from March 2003 to December 2004.  \n \n17.  The consultants will be responsible for data and information gathering and analysis, and \npreparing  the  draft  CEA  for  each  participating  country.  The  consultant  will  organize  the \nconsultation workshop in each country to solicit comments on the CEA.  The workshops will be \nattended  by  the  key  stakeholders,  including  government  representatives,  NGOs,  national \nexperts,  and  private  sector  representatives.  The  consultants  will  revise  the  CEA  reports, \nresponding to the comments, and assist ADB staff to finalize CEAs. The terms of reference for \nthe consultants and the outline of CEA are in Appendix 3 and 4. \n \n18.  The consultants will submit a detailed work plan within 4 weeks after the commencement \nof their services, an interim report at the end of 2003, and a final report at the end of the TA. A \ndraft CEA for each country will be submitted within the CSP time frame (Appendix 1). The draft \nCEA should be translated into the local language and delivered to the workshop participants for \nreview.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 on a grant basis for \nIntegrating Environmental Considerations into Development Policies, Plans, and Programs, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.

A consulting team consisting of two international and several local consultants will be \nrecruited to carry out the technical assistance (TA). The international consultants will provide an \nestimated  input  of  14  person-months  with  expertise  as  (i)  an  environmental  economist  (9 \nperson-months), and (ii) an environmental policy and planning specialist (5 person-months). The \nenvironmental economist will be the team leader. The domestic consultants will provide a total \nestimated  50  person-months  (4-7  person-months  for  each  participating  country,  and  a  10 \nperson-month TA project assistant at the Asian Development Bank [ADB] headquarters).  The \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  environmental  policy  and  management,  environmental \neconomics, environmental sciences, and administrative work.

In addition, the team leader will have overall substantive and administrative responsibility \nfor the effective and timely implementation of the TA. The team leader will lead the team; foster \nclose coordination between international and domestic consultants (including coordination of \ninputs, quality control of reports, financial management, and technical guidance); and coordinate \nwith the governments, ADB, and international organizations undertaking related work. The team ", "  Appendix 3  11 \nleader will periodically report the progress to ADB and submit high-quality, consolidated reports \nto ADB as specified. \n \n3.  The environmental policy and management specialist (5 person-months) will undertake \nthe tasks specified in para. 1 based on his or her competence on topics and countries. The \nspecialist will also undertake other activities as assigned by the team leader. \n \nB.  Domestic Consultants (in-country) \n4.  The domestic consultants will \n(i)  collect, review, and analyze data and information required for the preparation of \nCEAs and other related reports as specified; \n \n(ii)  assist the international consultants to coordinate key stakeholders in the country; \n \n(iii)  assist the international consultants to prepare the draft CEAs, frameworks of \naction, and other related reports as specified; \n \n(iv)  working together with the international consultants, organize the workshops;  and \n \n(v)  other activities as assigned by the team leader. \n \nC.   TA Project Assistant, based at ADB headquarters (10 person-month) \n \n5.  The project assistant will \n \n(i)  assist the ADB mission leader in TA administration; \n \n(ii)  assist the international consultants in collecting and analyzing information and \ndata and preparing documents; \n \n(iii)  coordinate with concerned ADB personnel regarding equipment, printing, and \nother related physical requirements; \n \n(iv)  assist with logistic support; and \n \n(v)  provide assistance for publication and dissemination. \n \nD.   Reporting Requirements \n \n6.  The consultants will submit a detailed work plan within 4 weeks after the commencement \nof their services. An interim report of TA progress and outstanding issues should be submitted \nat the end of 2003 and a final report at the end of the TA. The format of final report will be \ndetermined during the TA implementation based on the needs for dissemination of TA results. \nPreparation of the CEA reports should be in accordance with the CEA outline (Appendix 4), and \nsubmission of the CEA report for each country should be within the time frame specified in \nAppendix 1. The draft CEA reports should be translated into the local languages and delivered \nto the workshop participants for review.  \n \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \nCOUNTRY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \n \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY (10 pages) \n \n \nI.   INTRODUCTION \n \n \nII.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION \n \n \nA.   Role of Environment and Natural Resources in Economy  \n \n1.  Describe the role of environment and natural resources in the economy and identify the \nextent to which poor communities depend on environment and the natural resources for their \nlivelihood and well being. Estimate the sector share of gross domestic product (GDP) from \nnatural  resources  and  agriculture.  Identify  opportunities  for  sustainable  development  in \nenvironment and natural resources. \n \nB.   Key Environmental Issues faced in the country  \n \n2.
