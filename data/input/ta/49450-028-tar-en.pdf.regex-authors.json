THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will assess the potential for, \nand develop a roadmap of, financing floating photovoltaic (FPV) projects in the 11 small Pacific \nisland countries (PIC-11).1 The TA will conduct all required due diligence and prepare the first \nthree FPV projects for approval in 2022\u20132023 under the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment \nFacility or PREIF (the facility) approved in 2017.2 The proposed facility TA is included in the Pacific \nRegional Operations Business Plan, 2020\u20132022.3 \n \n2.  The facility impact is improved energy security following the outcome of lower cost and \ncleaner electricity generation. The facility outputs are (i) renewable energy generation constructed, \nand (ii) energy sector reform undertaken. The facility\u2019s estimated cost of $750 million, comprises \n(i) up to $200 million in Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing, (ii) an estimated $500 million \nfrom  cofinancing  sources,  and  (iii)  an  estimated  $50  million  from  government  counterpart \nfinancing. ADB will consider facility projects up to July 2022, for implementation up to July 2025. \nThe facility is generally on track to achieve the following performance indicators by 2025: \n(i) 80 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy generation capacity commissioned, (ii) 30 megawatt-\nhours (MWh) of battery storage installed, and (iii) 300 kilometers of transmission and distribution \nnetwork constructed. The status of facility performance is detailed in its 2019 annual report.4 \n \n3.  The  facility  is  currently  supported  by  three  regional  TA  facilities  to  support  project \npreparation, implementation, and capacity building, and energy sector and utility reforms in the \nPIC-11. The first TA, totaling $8.935 million, prepared eight projects which were approved in \n2017\u20132019, and is preparing four projects for approval in 2020 and 2021.5 The second TA, \ntotaling $5.8 million, is on track to achieve sector reform targets under the facility.6 The third TA \nof $4 million, approved in July 2019, is preparing at least four projects for approval in 2020\u20132023.7 \nAll of the TA funds are fully allocated. \n  \n4.  Pacific island countries (PICs) are small island developing states that have extreme land \nconstraints and are heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels for energy and transport.8 Climate \n \n1  The 11 countries are the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, the Marshall \nIslands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

Manila. \n8  For Kiribati, over 50% (~56,000) of the population lives on the main island of Tarawa atoll with only 16 square \nkilometers (km2) of land and 500 km2 of lagoons. Over 50% (~6,000) Tuvaluans live in Fongafale on the Funafuti \natoll, with only 2.8 km2 of land and 252 km2 of lagoons. Both islands are less than three meters above sea level and \nless than 500 meters wide, over which each government targets 100% renewable energy penetration by 2025. Tonga \naims to achieve 70% renewable energy penetration by 2030, needing 30 MW more PV, and is open to private sector \ninvestments, particularly in the main island of Tongatapu where 75% of the population lives. Tongatapu has 260 km2 \nof land and several bays and large lagoons. Funafuti needs 7.6 MW PV and 14 MWh of battery energy storage \nsystem (BESS) while South Tarawa needs 25 MW PV and 32 MWh of BESS to reach 100% penetration. Funafuti \ninstalled capacity is 1.8MW diesel and 735 kW PV (16% penetration). South Tarawa has 5.5 MW diesel and 1.5 MW \nPV (9% renewable energy penetration). \n ", "2 \nchange and extreme geophysical and meteorological events pose additional threats to these \nfragile  economies  and  worsen  existing  development  challenges  such  as  deterioration  of \ninfrastructure. PIC-11 have committed to investing in disaster-resilient renewable energy to \naddress the above issues. As of December 2019, eight renewable energy projects, mainly solar \nphotovoltaic (PV), battery storage systems, and mini grids, have been approved under PREIF \nand are now under implementation in Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Republic of \nMarshall Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n \n5.  ADB has committed to help finance PIC-11\u2019s ambitious plans in the renewable energy \ngenerations investment. With solar PV being the least-cost energy generation technology in the \nPICs, the emerging FPV technology is well-placed to tap their enormous water surface and solar \nresource potential.9 FPV addresses the PICs\u2019 unique challenges and vulnerabilities while limiting \nclimate impacts. Though FPV requires stricter standards than land-based PV given its exposure \nto water, it has added advantages in that it (i) frees up land for other use and saves on land \nacquisition and preparation costs; (ii) allows higher yields due to the cooling effect of water; \n(iii) conserves water through reduced evaporation; (iv) has readily available water for module \ncleaning; (v) is quick to install; and, (vi) addresses energy-water-food-climate nexus. The cost for \nthe floating, anchoring, and mooring system is offset by both the reduced land acquisition and \npreparation costs and the higher energy yield. FPV includes PV panels built on stilts above water. \n \n6.  The proposed TA will help develop a roadmap of the FPV investment in PIC-11 and to \nprepare FPV projects in Kiribati, Tonga, and Tuvalu for approval within 2022\u20132023 and for \nfinancing by either public or private sector.10 The TA underpins ADB\u2019s Strategy 203011 and Pacific \nApproach, 2016\u20132020.12 It will address vulnerabilities and needs for investment and reforms, \nconsidering current energy sector strategies and utility reforms, and may include demand-side \nmanagement and efficiency measures, and value-added end-uses beyond electricity.13 The TA \nwill finance institutional capacity building and will develop pre-feasibility concepts for the next \nthree FPV projects for potential ADB and private sector financing.14 Subject to funding availability \nand government requests, the TA may prepare these additional FPV projects.  \n \n7.  The TA will prepare gender-sensitive, energy efficient and climate-resilient FPV projects. \nThe TA will build on lessons and recommendations from ongoing renewable energy projects in \nthe beneficiary countries and will promote the use of innovative procurement and contracting \napproaches such as joint procurement of design-build-operate contracts for the public-sector \nfunded projects. It will also consider the impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic on the power \nsector and the utilities in designing the ensuing projects. \n \n9  As of June 2020, around 500 FPV projects totaling 1.8 GW have been installed, compared to over 505 GW global \nPV installed capacity. Nearshore marine FPV is nascent but large plants are being constructed in 2020 including 180 \nMW in Taipei,China, 5 MW in Singapore, and 4 MW in Seychelles. Austria, France, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United States, are global leaders in FPV.   \n10 The projects are included in the forthcoming PIC-11 country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023. The project sites \nrepresent different water characteristics and configurations for easy replication. The utilities have experience in land-\nbased and rooftop PV and have policies and targets to reach up to 100% renewable energy grid penetration. The TA \nwill build on the experience from ADB-funded PV and BESS projects: Tonga Renewable Energy Project, Tuvalu \nIncreasing Access to Renewable Energy Project and the proposed Kiribati South Tarawa Renewable Energy Project, \nall under the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility (footnote 2). \n11 ADB. 2018.

Project 1. The proposed Kiribati South Tarawa Renewable Energy Project (Phase 2), for \napproval in 2022, will indicatively install 5 MW of floating and ground-mounted solar photovoltaic, \na battery energy storage system (BESS), as needed, and associated grid infrastructure. The \ngovernment is seeking $12 million grant from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund  (ADF) and \ncofinancing from the Government of Australia.  \n \n9.  Project 2. The proposed Tonga Floating Solar Project will indicatively install 5 MW of FPV \nin Tongatapu, through private sector financing. The TA will help structure the project for private \nsector financing. Subject to the project\u2019s viability, further assistance may be provided to help with \nthe selection of independent power producers.15  \n \n10.  Project  3.  The  proposed  Tuvalu  Increasing  Access  to  Renewable  Energy  Project \n(Phase 2) for consideration in 2022 aims to install indicatively 1\u20132 MW of floating and rooftop \nphotovoltaic system, a BESS, as needed, and grid infrastructure in Funafuti. Cofinancing from the \nGlobal Environment Facility and potentially from the Government of Australia are being sought. \n \n11.  Institutional capacity building support. The TA will supplement training and knowledge \nsharing events of the regional platforms like the Pacific Power Association. It will also build \ncapacity of the relevant stakeholders on the technical, governance, safeguards, climate, and \ngender aspects specific to FPV. Up to 2 regional conferences and up to 2 seminars or workshops \nper country, with at least 20%\u201340% women in at least 100 participants from stakeholders \nincluding project executing and implementing agencies, will be conducted.  \n \nB.
