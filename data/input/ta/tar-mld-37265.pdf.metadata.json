The Republic of the Maldives has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical \nassistance (TA) to conduct a feasibility study of improving domestic maritime transport for ADB \nfinancing.1 An ADB Mission visited the Maldives in July 2004 to undertake fact-finding for the TA \nand  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  goal,  purpose,  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The TA is included in Country \nStrategy and Program Update, 2004\u20132006. The preliminary project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Maldives consists of about 1,190 islands, grouped into 20 administrative atolls. \nEach atoll is a coral reef surrounding a lagoon. Mal\u00e9 is the capital city and is also designated as \none of the administrative atolls. Almost all land masses are very small, averaging only 16 \nhectares. Over 80% of the land mass is less than 1 meter above mean sea level, exposing the \npopulation to tidal waves, storms, and the risk of an increase in the sea level resulting from \nglobal warming. The population of 270,000 is scattered among 200 inhabited islands. A quarter \nof the population reside on Mal\u00e9. The Maldives has no known mineral resources and scant \narable land. However, due to well-performing tourism and fisheries industries dominating the \neconomy \u2014 the two accounting for nearly 40% of gross domestic product (GDP)  \u2014 the \neconomy has achieved high growth of 7.4% annually since 1991, and per capita GDP increased \nfrom $1,711 in 1997 to $2,261 in 2003.2 \n \n3.  Despite the high level of economic growth in recent years, a large segment of the \nMaldives\u2019 population subsists on very low incomes and are considered poor. The Vulnerability \nand Poverty Assessment3 reports that, as of 1998, 43% of the population subsists on a per \ncapita income of Rf15 ($1.30) per day or less, and almost 90% of them reside in the atolls. \nIncome disparities were in the order of 2:1, and access to social and physical infrastructure and \nservices was even worse, averaging 4:1. Isolation is an important element of human poverty in \nmany atolls (Appendix 2). Further, limited transportation opportunities add to remoteness and \nisolation. One third of the atoll population report that opportunities to travel to Mal\u00e9 are limited to \n2\u20133 sailings per week. Access problems were reported by half of the atoll population due to \nproblems with harbors, absence of a jetty, or penetrating reefs. \n \n4.  In its Sixth National Development Plan (2001\u20132005), the Government emphasizes the \nimportance of regionally balanced development through the focus islands in five regional growth \ncenters in the north, south, north-central, central, and south-central atolls, for balanced provision \nof economic and social services. Consistent with this national development  objective, ADB \nfinanced the first Regional Development Project  (RDP I)4 to facilitate equitable  development \nincluding the provision of basic infrastructure and capacity building. The Sea Transport Study5 \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 9 January 2004. \n2  The event of 11 September 2001 and the phenomenon of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 \nhave negatively affected the country\u2019s economy due to a deteriorated performance of the tourist sector, e.g., the \nnumber of tourist arrivals dropped in 2001 with the sector exhibiting zero growth for the first time. However, the \nnumber of tourist arrivals is now on the rise. \n3  Ministry of Planning and National Development and United Nations Development Programme, 1998. The data is \ncurrently being updated, and will be available in December 2004. \n4  ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of the Maldives for the Regional Development Project. Manila. \n5  Ministry of Planning and National Development, and ADB, 2000. ", "2 \nunder RDP I (footnote 4) indicated that transport systems need to be developed in parallel with \nother sectors. \n \n5.  Domestic transport of freight and passengers is predominantly by sea. As there are no \nsignificant  regional  centers  in  the  Maldives  apart  from  Gan  Island  in  the  south,  domestic \nmaritime freight and passenger traffic is dominated by movements directly between Mal\u00e9 and \nindividual small island communities. In this regard, Mal\u00e9-to-outer islands traffic is almost entirely \nimport cargo transshipped at Mal\u00e9 Port. Heavy congestion prevails at the inter-atoll harbor in \nMal\u00e9. Regular maritime transport services between Mal\u00e9 and the outer islands, and within and \nbetween the outer atolls, are few and infrequent. Interisland shipping services are operated \nentirely by the private sector, while the Government provides essential infrastructure such as \nports and deepened harbors, and regulatory functions like maritime safety.  \n \n6.  The extent of transport facilities varies considerably from island to island. Some islands \nhave man-made harbors, while others have natural harbors, lagoons, and jetties of different \nlengths and construction. In addition, there are islands that have neither natural harbors nor \neven jetties for unloading and access to the islands. A total of 100 islands in the country still \nhave  no  harbors.  Most  of  the  existing  man-made  harbors  do  not  meet  the  minimum \nrequirements  of  the  Ministry  of  Atoll  Development  (MOAD).  Some  major  harbors  need \nsubstantial rehabilitation due to deterioration, which has caused bottlenecks to the movement of \npeople and goods. Restricted movement has hampered efforts to regional development. \n \n7.  Currently,  government  interventions  in  private  operations  in  the  domestic  maritime \ntransport subsector are minimal. One of the limited government interventions is user charges in \nMal\u00e9 harbor.  However, the regulations are not enforced at Northern Inter-Atoll Harbor. As a \nresult, the harbor is congested and lacks funding for maintenance. No user charges are levied \non users of transport infrastructure in outer islands where costs of minor maintenance are \ncollected from vessel owners when necessary and costs of major maintenance are requested \nfrom the Government. Though there is a harbor maintenance program under  MOAD, its very \nlimited budget6 results in the deterioration of harbors, jetties, and other facilities (para. 6). The \nlimited Government support to private operators in terms of finance, physical infrastructure, and \ninstitutional arrangement results in few regular and frequent services, and compromises the \nsafety and convenience of the passengers. \n \n8.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation  (MTCA)  is  responsible  for  overall \ndevelopment of maritime transport networks. The Ministry of Construction and Public Works \n(MCPW) is responsible for constructing maritime infrastructure such as harbors and jetties in \nMal\u00e9 and islands in the vicinity of Mal\u00e9. For the outer atolls, MOAD identifies islands in need of \nharbor development and submits its requirements and recommendations to the Ministry of \nPlanning and National Development (MPND), which then decides on where money provided by \nthe Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) is to be invested. Once harbors and jetties have \nbeen built, ongoing maintenance of infrastructure then falls under the responsibility of the \nvarious island offices; if major costs are involved, central Government funding may be made \navailable. Most line ministries have limited absorptive capacity due to the scarcity of skilled and \nexperienced staff. \n \n9.  Since 1979, ADB has provided the Maldives with four loan projects in the transport \nsector. They include an attempt to initiate a scheduled interisland transport service and support \n                                                 \n6  The estimated budget requirement for the harbor maintenance program is Rf728 million ($56.9 million). It would \ntake 18\u201320 years to complete the program under the current level of the budget. ", "    3 \nto improve the operations of Mal\u00e9 Port. Except for the Interisland Transport Project,7 approved \nby ADB in 1981, ADB\u2019s past assistance in the transport sector proved successful in extending \nthe physical capacity of Mal\u00e9 Port and upgrading its institutional capacity. Important lessons \nlearned from the Interisland Transport Project for improving domestic maritime transport in the \ncountry  include  the  following:  (i)  transport  is  only  one  factor  in  economic  and  social \ndevelopment; by itself, it cannot promote development; (ii) the project needs to be built on the \nexisting formal and informal transport activities in terms of routes and operation, and any \nattempts by the Government to intervene in private sector provision of transport services should \nbe considered with extreme caution; (iii) island-specific shoreline, e.g., limited accessibility to \nlarge vessels due to shallowness, and demand characteristics, need to be well taken  into \naccount; and (iv) an appropriate regulatory and pricing framework of interisland transport needs \nto be set up. \n \n10.  The  ADB-financed  transport  master  plan8 currently  being  finalized  will  identify  the \ngeneral transport policies, strategies, legal and regulatory framework, investment programs, and \nactivities necessary for ensuring a nationwide integrated transport network. Among investment \nprograms proposed under the draft transport master plan, the Government has decided that the \ninter- and intra-atoll maritime transport is the most immediate priority. The draft transport master \nplan  also  has  recommendations  for  implementing  policies  in  the  transport  sector. \nRecommendations pertinent to domestic maritime transport are (i) medical and food emergency \nissues; (ii) operation and maintenance (O&M) scheme for harbors and facilities through a cost \nrecovery mechanism with consistent user charges; (iii) government support or deregulation to \nassist  private  sector  operators  in  providing  reliable  services;  and  (iv)  cross-cutting  issues \nincluding environment, capacity building, and maritime safety.  \n \n11.  Lack of reliable services and inadequate infrastructure are major obstacles to safe and \nefficient domestic maritime transport. The regularity, frequency, and cost of transport services \nhave a significant impact on the social and economic development of the islands. Having an \nintegrated,  efficient  transport  network  that  systematically  links  Mal\u00e9,  the  regional  centers \ncurrently  under  development,  and  the  surrounding  atolls  will  be  key  to  ensuring  that \nsocioeconomic growth in the Maldives is distributed equitably. Assistance is therefore required \nto improve the domestic maritime transport system to provide safer, more efficient and more \naccessible  services.  Such  assistance  will  support  the  development  of  various  sectors  in \nfostering  regionally  balanced  growth  and  take  into  account  the  lessons  learned  and  the \nconceptual framework of the transport master plan. ADB's operational strategy for the Maldives \nis consistent with these objectives. The likely improvements to the maritime transport system \nmay include (i) improving harbors and facilities, with O&M programming, in Mal\u00e9 and selected \nislands; (ii) improving vessels to provide appropriate space for passengers; (iii) facilitating \ninformation and communication about planned travel, including possible scheduled services; \nand (iv) strengthening maritime safety.     \n \n \nIII.

", "4 \nreduction, regionally balanced economic growth, and national integration. The purpose of the \nTA is to identify ways to improve maritime transport, and develop a project for possible ADB \nfinancing, including (i) required facilities for maritime transport; and (ii) technical, institutional, \nand policy solutions for improving the safety, efficiency, and accessibility of the existing maritime \ntransport system. The TA will also identify a sustainable and effective delivery mechanism for \nmaintaining the proposed facilities; technical, organizational, institutional, and human resources \nimprovements for efficient transport services; and cost recovery or subsidy mechanisms that will \nallow effective and consistent O&M  of facilities and vessels. The TA will support a feasibility \nstudy of the project from the engineering, economic, social, and environmental points of view in \naccordance with ADB policies, operational procedures, and guidelines. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Existing ocean routes and detailed needs will initially be identified and assessed based \non existing studies such as the Sea Transport Study (2000), Transport Master Plan (2004), and \nrelevant development policies and strategies; and an additional survey to supplement existing \nstudies. On the basis of the assessment, the core routes to  connect focal islands or where \nsafety  and  economic  inefficiency  problems  occur  will  be  identified.  After  core  routes  are \nidentified, ways to improve the transport service will be determined based on traffic demand \nforecast and other requirements. Then, preliminary designs and cost estimates for the proposed \nimprovements, including physical facilities and vessels, and schemes for service provision, will \nbe prepared. Annual and regular O&M programs for the next 10 years will be prepared. A \nsustainable management mechanism for delivering the proposed facilities and services will also \nbe prepared. A cost recovery mechanism with appropriate user charges will be established to \nprovide for the proposed improvements, taking into account users' willingness to pay. Economic, \nsocial, and environmental assessment will be conducted in accordance with ADB's and the \nGovernment's  policies,  guidelines,  and  procedural  requirements.  Finally,  implementation \narrangements  and  institutional  requirements  will  be  proposed  for  project  execution  and \nmaintenance, taking into account difficulties due to geographic and socioeconomic conditions. \nThe feasibility study will be prepared in a format suitable for use in further processing by ADB \nfor possible loan financing. \n \n14.  Consultation  meetings  involving  public  and  private  sector  entities,  i.e.,  concerned \nministries, transport service providers, transport service users, especially local communities in \nfocal islands, will be held at the early stage to appropriately design the project, incorporating \nexisting transport systems. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $590,000 equivalent, comprising $380,000 in \nforeign  exchange,  and  $210,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $500,000 \nequivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local currency cost of \n$120,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe Government will finance the remaining $90,000 equivalent of the local currency cost \nthrough in-kind contributions of the Executing Agency and Implementing Agency. The detailed \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MOFT will be the Executing Agency and MTCA will be the Implementing Agency for the \nTA. MTCA will nominate a core group of counterpart staff, headed by a TA director, to work \nclosely with the consultants for day-to-day implementation and to report the progress of the TA \nto ADB. A steering committee chaired by the TA director and comprising representatives from \nstakeholder ministries such as MOFT, MPND, MTCA, MOAD and MCPW will be established \nbefore the consultants are fielded to give them overall guidance. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, starting in January 2005 and ending in July \n2005. Approval of advance action for recruiting consultants was approved in August 2004. \n \n19.  A multidisciplinary team of consultants will provide a total input of 45 person-months of \nconsulting  services:  15  international  and  30  domestic.  Both  international  and  domestic \nconsultants will have expertise in (i) transport planning and economics (maritime), (ii) maritime \nor coastal engineering, (iii) financial analysis in maritime transport, (iv) resettlement with social \nanalysis, and (v) maritime environmental assessment. For maritime safety, domestic inputs will \nbe provided for a public awareness program. The team of consultants, from an international \nconsulting firm in association with domestic consultants, will be selected and engaged by ADB \nusing ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedures and in accordance with its Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (using  the  simplified  technical  proposal  procedure)  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Equipment  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement  under the direct purchase \nprocedure. Appendix 4 gives the outline terms of reference for the consultants. \n \n20.  The consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 1 month, (ii) an interim report \nwithin 3 months, and (iii) a draft final report within 5 months of the start of the feasibility study. In \naddition, the consultants will submit a final report within 1 month of receipt of comments on the \ndraft final report after due consideration of comments made by the Government and ADB. The \ninception report will highlight the progress made, initial findings with candidate project elements, \nand any recommendations and proposed changes to the work program. The interim report will \ninclude preliminary study results for the proposed project. Necessary inputs and assistance will \nbe provided to assist the ADB loan processing fact-finding mission. The draft final report will \ninclude final study results for the project, including reports on safeguard issues to be used in \nloan preparation. During TA implementation, meetings between the steering committee and \nconsultants will be held monthly in Mal\u00e9 or as needed, to review and discuss TA progress. The \nmonthly progress report will be sent to the Government and ADB. A tripartite meeting to discuss \nthe inception, interim, and draft final reports, respectively, will be held in Mal\u00e9 within 1 month of \nissuance of each report. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Maldives for preparing the Domestic Maritime Transport Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and \nIndicators/Targets    Risks \n \nGoal       \n       \nSupported regionally  Improved social and  National, regional and   \nbalanced growth, poverty  economic indicators in outer  island economic data and \nreduction, and national  islands, e.g., focal islands,  statistics \nintegration in the country  compared with those in   \nMal\u00e9 by year 2010 \n \n \nPurpose       \n       \nImproved maritime  Increased maritime traffic by  Baseline data collected in  A:  Sustained growth in \ntransport system in terms  20% by year 2010  the Transport Master Plan  market for freight and \nof efficiency, safety, and    Study  passenger transport \naccessibility  Reduced travel time by 30%     \n  and costs by 10% by year  Periodic traffic volume  A: Government\u2019s \n  2010  survey in atolls  capacity for supporting \n      operators, e.g., \n  Improved service and  Transport sector statistics:  subsidies, maintaining \n  accessibility, and reduced  vessels (Ministry of  facilities, enforcing \naccidents by year 2010.
