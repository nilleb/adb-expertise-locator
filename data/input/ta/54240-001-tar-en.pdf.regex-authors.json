INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the promotion of clean \nenergy through the preparation of a road map to accelerate deployment of electric vehicles              \n(e-vehicles) and grid integration of battery energy storage systems in India. \n \n2.  The TA aligns with operational priority 3 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy \n2030  (tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability) by supporting decarbonizing of transport systems and supporting \nIndia\u2019s transition to a cleaner energy mix through adoption of grid-integrated battery storage \nsystems.1 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for India, 2021\u20132023,2 \nsupports  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2018\u20132022,3 and  is  consistent  with \ngovernment strategies and flagship programs.4 The Government of India submitted a request for \nthis TA on 30 July 2020.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Air pollution in India is a serious health issue. Of the 30 most polluted cities in the world in \n2019, 21 were in India, with one-quarter of this pollution arising from vehicles.6 India\u2019s mobility \nsystem has many of the fundamental prerequisites for adopting electric-mobility (e-mobility) \narchitecture, including low rates of private vehicle ownership, high rates of shared mobility, a large \nshare of nonmotorized transit, and diverse modes of transport. E-vehicles have zero tailpipe \nemissions; reduce local street-level air pollution, especially in cities; and can act as mobile energy \nstorage services.7 The government has created momentum through its Faster Adoption and \nManufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles initiative, which encourages and in some segments \nmandates the adoption of e-vehicles, with a goal of reaching 30% e-vehicle penetration by 2030. \nThe initiative creates incentives for e-vehicles and encourages the deployment of charging \ninfrastructure in urban centers. Realizing these objectives by 2030 will result in carbon dioxide \nemission reductions of 846 million tons over the lifetime of these e-vehicles.8 However, India \naccounts for only about 0.2% of the global e-vehicle stock. The Indian e-vehicle market is still in \nits nascent stage and is dominated by two-wheelers and three-wheelers, with about 0.4 million \nelectric two wheelers, 0.1 million e-rickshaws, and 7,000 electric cars. \n \n4.  Lower e-vehicle penetration can be attributed primarily to a lack of adequate e-vehicle \ncharging  infrastructure  and  high  upfront  costs  of  e-vehicles.    While  e-vehicle  charging \ninfrastructure is being ramped up, the challenge of high initial purchasing prices can be tackled \nthrough increased battery manufacturing capacity. Since the battery accounts for about one-third \nof the total purchase price of an e-vehicle, driving down battery costs through rapid scale-up of \nproduction and standardizing battery components will be key to the long-term success of India\u2019s \nautomotive sector, with knock-on benefits for energy storage development (mobile storage, and \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

India\u2019s market for e-vehicle \nbatteries alone could be worth as much as $300 billion by 2030.9 India could represent more than \none-third of global e-vehicle battery demand by 2030 if the country meets its goal of rapidly \ntransitioning to shared, connected, and electric mobility. Driving down battery costs will not only \nimpact e-vehicle demand but will also contribute to enhanced renewable energy integration at the \ngrid level through deployment of energy storage. \n \n5.  Deployment  of  battery  technologies  is  highly  synergistic  with  e-vehicle  deployment; \npursuing these in a coordinated manner will be critical to meeting the e-mobility-driven increase \nin electricity demand through sustainable renewable energy integrated at the grid level. The \ngovernment has established an ambitious target of 175 gigawatts (GW) of installed renewable \nenergy capacity by 2022, which includes 60 GW of wind and 100 GW of solar, up from capacities \nof about 35 GW of wind and 26 GW of solar in 2019. The government targets 450 GW of installed \nrenewable energy capacity by 2030.10 India\u2019s electrical grid will have to evolve accordingly to \nmeet this ambitious target without compromising stability or reliability. Solar and wind power are \nintermittent in nature, and the timing of their output can be predicted with some accuracy, but the \ntime-of-use cannot be controlled without improved energy storage. Because of this, integration of \nrenewable  energy  into  the  grid  at  such  a  scale  will  face  several  challenges,  including \ninstantaneous changes in plant output, daily and seasonal variation in energy output, daily and \nseasonal variation in demand, and nonconcurrence of generation and demand peaks. Battery \nstorage has proven to be reliable for short-term grid stability and back-up power (e.g., at the 100-\nmegawatt Hornsdale facility in Australia), reducing the need for fossil-fuel peaking plants; the \nbatteries for these applications can be stationary or mobile, although mobile storage has yet to \nbe deployed at scale in developing countries.  \n \n6.   E-vehicles will require flexible usage of charging infrastructure backed by consistent \npower from the grid. Installation of charging infrastructure for e-vehicles presents both challenges \nand opportunities: a growing e-vehicle fleet will increase stress on the grid, creating a need for \nintelligent charging systems; at the same time, e-vehicles represent mobile energy storage, \nproviding grid stability by absorbing the variable output from solar and wind generation. Battery \nstorage systems form the critical link in an integrated e-vehicle and renewable-energy-driven \nsolution to address air pollution and promote the longer-term decarbonization of India\u2019s economy. \nIt is estimated that India\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions will double by 2030 compared to 2012.11 \nAddressing a problem of this scale will require a multipronged approach through synergistic \ninvestments in battery technologies and e-vehicles to complement investments in variable-output \nrenewable energy. Governments need to make or facilitate investments in battery technologies \nand e-vehicle projects to power generation companies, power distribution companies, and other \nstakeholders. Developing projects that are both technically and commercially feasible will attract \ninvestors and ensure more clean energy in India\u2019s energy generation mix.12 Power distribution \ncompanies are well-positioned in the value chain to provide improved electricity services accruing \nfrom battery energy technologies, while generating revenue through the provision of electricity as \na transport fuel via charging infrastructure. \n \n \n9  Mercom Communications.

India\u2019s emissions will double at most by 2030. Delhi.  \n12 Even without massive growth in intermittent renewable energy, on-grid energy storage deployment will have \nsignificant value for grid stability and the quality and reliability of electricity services. Energy storage is included in \nthis TA project because batteries used in e-vehicles can be repurposed for \u201csecond life\u201d stationary applications. \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: air quality in cities and uptake of renewable \nenergy and storage solutions improved (footnote 4). The TA will have the following outcome: \naccelerated deployment of e-vehicles and battery energy storage systems.13 The TA will support \npreparation of road maps for accelerated deployment of e-vehicles and battery energy storage in \nselected states.14  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Integrated development plan for promoting electric vehicles created. This \noutput will address key impediments to e-vehicle adoption in India. E-vehicle supply chain \nanalysis and a survey of the automotive industry will be conducted to understand and address \nthe key issues that are preventing the shift toward an e-vehicle-based mobility system. The \nanalysis will be further supplemented by global benchmark studies to address \u201cpain points\u201d in the \nIndian market that are hindering large-scale adoption of e-vehicles. As any marked shift in the \nautomotive sector has employment and labor skills implications, wide stakeholder consultations \nat the central and state level will be carried out to understand and address gaps\u2014e.g., by \nupgrading  the  skills  of  staff  across  different  segments  of  the  automotive  industry  through \nworkshops, who in turn can help support cleaner e-vehicle-based mobility systems. The survey \nof the automotive industry will also address the perceived impact of e-vehicle adoption on \ntransport companies and independent owners of three-wheeler and four-wheeler rickshaws and \ntaxi fleets/units. The TA will support carrying out of analysis on potential incentive schemes, \nincluding enhancing the availability of credit facilities for e-vehicles. Gender-related elements will \nbe incorporated as appropriate; these may include ensuring the participation of women in training \nand capacity-building activities. Similarly, proper management of old e-vehicle batteries and units \nwill be assessed and best practices shared to ensure that these cheap, old units will not simply \nbe relegated to rural or newly urbanized towns (thereby increasing pollution in those towns). \n \n9.  Output 2: Road map for deployment of battery technologies developed.  This output \nwill support electricity distribution companies and/or other entities to develop a strategy for \nadopting battery technologies and systems that will encourage e-vehicle deployment and lead to \na higher percentage of renewables in the energy mix. The techno-commercial aspects of various \nbattery technologies and limitations of the current system will be analyzed. This output will also \nsupport and encourage public companies to go green and reduce their carbon footprints by \ninvesting in improved battery technologies. The output will look at how to properly dispose of \nand/or reuse old batteries and assess the environmental and climate impacts of battery power at \nall stages of the battery life cycle. Activities will support the development of a robust battery \nstorage market in the country and in selected states to meet the requirements of an electrical grid \nwith a large renewable energy mix in the overall energy portfolio. Development and deployment \nof battery technologies will promote e-vehicles in the country. Prospects for joint ventures or \ntechnology partnerships with established technology-leading companies in other countries will be \nexplored as part of the road map preparation. \n \n \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14 States will be selected based on criteria to be developed, which will include but not be limited to a state\u2019s interest in \nthe project, its plans to promote e-vehicles and battery storage, and complementarity with other ongoing efforts. \n ", "4 \n10.  Innovative aspects  of  project  design.  The  TA  will support  activities  that  address \nbottlenecks preventing the scale-up of e-vehicles and battery technologies in India. Through \npartnerships  with  the  government\u2019s  central  planning  agency\u2014the  National  Institution  for \nTransforming India (NITI Aayog)\u2014power distribution companies, and other key players in the       \ne-vehicle\u2013renewable energy value chain, the TA project will help the government meet its clean \nenergy  targets.  By  pursuing  battery  energy  technologies  and  e-vehicle  development  in  a \ncoordinated manner, the TA will facilitate identification of new investment opportunities in charging \ninfrastructure, stationary storage (including repurposing of used e-vehicle batteries for second-life \nstorage), vehicle-to-grid systems and services, storage-enabled power trading, and more. This \nwill build on efforts by ADB projects through Energy Efficiency Services Limited in India for \npromotion of e-vehicles and charging stations along with promotion of various demand-side \nenergy efficiency investments, and on biofuels with Indian Oil Company Limited to provide \nsynergetic response. The TA will focus on creating demand and enable greater deployment of \nbattery technologies and e-vehicles rather than vehicle manufacturing.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nAsian  Clean  Energy  Fund 15 under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  and \nadministered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  Eligible expenditures include (i) consultant services; and (ii) non-consultant costs for local \ntraining, workshops, minimal equipment such as computers, and operating costs essential to carry \nout the TA, including rent of vehicles, if justified. \n  \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.
