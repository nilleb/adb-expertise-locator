INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will increase teaching, learning, and \nsupport systems and instructional resources using information and communication technology \n(ICT) to develop students\u2019 core competencies and reduce rural\u2013urban disparities in primary \neducation in Gansu Province, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) through policy advice, capacity \ndevelopment, and research. The Government of the PRC requested this TA from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to deliver high-quality and balanced primary education. Following an \nADB mission in March 2019, ADB and the government reached an understanding on the TA \nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference for consultants.1 \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for the PRC, 2018\u20132020.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Facing a rapidly changing environment as the country transitions to a knowledge-based, \ninnovation-driven, and creative economy, the PRC Ministry of Education (MOE) in 2014 initiated \na new round of curriculum reform that emphasized the comprehensive individual development of \neach student with a sense of responsibility and practical and innovation skills instead of focusing \nstrictly on subject knowledge and examination scores.3 As part of the reform, core competencies \nfor each level of education have been identified and incorporated into the curriculum.4 Integrated \npractice activities have also been introduced to primary education.5 The reform has further \nprioritized the development of instructional resources through the use of ICT, transforming \nteaching\u2013learning  methods  into  student-centered  and  problem-  and  project-based,  further \nintegrating  subjects  and  providing  enriched  learning  opportunities  for  students  through  the \ninvolvement of a wider society, adopting diverse assessment measures to track student progress \nand devise individualized instructional strategies, promoting teachers\u2019 professional development, \nand strengthening school-based research and development activities. \n \n3.  The China Education Modernization 2035, issued in February 2019, reemphasized these \npriorities  and  outlined  more  specific  measures.6 At  the  same  time,  the  China  Education \nModernization 2035 recognizes disparities in 9-year compulsory education (primary and lower \nsecondary education) between rural and urban areas and aims to achieve high-quality and \nbalanced compulsory education by 2035. \n \n4.  Located in the northwest of the PRC, Gansu Province is poor, with gross domestic product  \nper capita of CNY28,497 in 2017\u2014the lowest gross domestic product recorded among all \nprovinces in the PRC. It remains largely rural, with an urbanization rate of 46.4% in 2017, \nsignificantly lower than the national average of 58.5%. Of 6,172 primary schools in Gansu \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 April 2019. \n2  ADB. 2018.

The original TA title \nStrengthening Core Competencies Development for Primary Schools has been adjusted to better reflect its objective. \n3  Government  of  the  PRC,  MOE.  2014.  Opinion  on  Comprehensively  Deepening  Curriculum  Reform  and \nStrengthening Moral Education and Talent Cultivation. Beijing. The first round of curriculum reform was launched in \n2001 with emphasis on students\u2019 attitudes and values (Government of the PRC, MOE. 2001. Outline for Basic \nEducation Curriculum Reform. Beijing). \n4  Core competencies include cultural and scientific literacy; lifelong learning, self-awareness, and self-management; \nsocial and global awareness and responsibility; and practical and innovation abilities. \n5  Government of the PRC, MOE. 2017.

Integrated practice activities encourage students to apply different concepts across \nvarious subjects in real life activities. \n6  Communist Party of China Central Committee and State Council. 2019. China Education Modernization 2035. \nBeijing. \n ", "2 \nProvince in 2017, 4,675 (75.7%) were in rural areas. There were also 5,128 village primary \nteaching facilities that did not teach all primary grades (1\u20136). Urban primary schools are distinct \nfrom village primary teaching facilities. Whereas at urban primary schools teachers teach just one \nsubject, at village primary teaching facilities teachers teach multiple subjects. Because teachers \nare not attracted to work in rural areas, there is a shortage of qualified English, art, music, and \nphysical education teachers in rural areas. Moreover, village primary teaching facilities have \nsignificantly less instructional resources, and provide less diverse learning opportunities for \nstudents than urban primary schools. Working conditions in rural areas\u2014and therefore the \nchallenges that rural teachers face\u2014differ from urban areas, and training programs tailored to the \nneeds of teachers in rural areas are scarce. Such training programs are needed to implement the \ncurriculum  that  emphasizes  the  development  of  students\u2019  core  competencies,  requiring \nfundamental  changes  in  teaching-learning  methods.  Consequently,  students  in rural  areas, \nespecially  at  village  primary  teaching  facilities,  are  disadvantaged  in  developing  core \ncompetencies.7 \n \n5.  Gansu Province\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Education Development Plan reflects the condition \ndescribed above.8 It also mirrors the priorities for national curriculum reform.9 As of March 2019, \nsignificant progress has been made in deploying qualified teachers to rural areas; providing \ntraining for teachers in rural areas; equipping all primary schools, including village primary \nteaching  facilities,  with  ICT  (computers,  interactive  whiteboards,  and  videoconferencing \nequipment) and broadband internet connections; providing school breakfasts, lunches, and bus \nservices at rural primary schools and village primary teaching facilities; and shifting emphasis to \nthe comprehensive development of each individual student by strengthening art, music, physical \neducation, and school-based integrated practice activities. \n \n6.  Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province, is at the forefront of efforts to reform education in \nthe province. The municipality has 742 primary schools (of which 259 are in rural areas) and      \n154 village primary teaching facilities.10 There are two national certified preservice and in-service \nteacher-training institutes (Northwest Normal University and Lanzhou City College) and provincial \ncertified in-service teacher-training institutes (Lanzhou Institute for Education Research, Lanzhou \nBranch of Beijing No. 2 Experimental Primary School, and Lanzhou Experimental Primary School), \nas well as the Lanzhou Audio-Visual Education Center, which supports schools, teachers, and \nstudents in ICT. More than 90% of classrooms at urban primary schools are multimedia equipped, \nwhile  most  rural  primary  schools  and  village  primary  teaching  facilities  have  at  least  one \nclassroom that is multimedia equipped. The use of interactive whiteboards is common in Lanzhou, \neven at village primary teaching facilities. Since 2018, it has become possible to connect \nclassrooms at urban and rural primary schools and village primary teaching facilities through \nvideoconferencing to overcome the shortage of qualified teachers in rural areas. Moreover, some \nadvanced urban primary schools use student information and learning management systems, \naccessible via mobile phone, where teachers assess each student\u2019s progress after each lesson \nand provide feedback to students and their parents. They also encourage subject teachers to \ncollaborate in planning, preparing, and delivering lessons around common themes. \n                                                \n7  According to studies on gender inequality in education in the PRC, gender disparities related to access to and \ncompletion of primary education have almost disappeared\u2014even in rural and poor areas and among disadvantaged \ngroups\u2014since tuition fees were abolished in 2006. Because the sex ratio at birth is imbalanced in the PRC (115.2 in \n2017), there are more boys in primary education than girls (about 47% of all the students) in Gansu Province in 2017. \n8  Gansu Provincial People\u2019s Government. 2016. Gansu Province Thirteenth Five-Year Education Development Plan. \nLanzhou. \n9  Gansu Education Department. 2016. Opinion on Comprehensively Deepening Compulsory Education Curriculum \nReform. Lanzhou. \n10 In 2018, the number of students in primary education was 218,730, of which 102,869, or 47%, were girls. There were \n13,719 teachers, of whom 9,468, or 69%, were women.  \n ", "3 \n7.  However, except at advanced urban primary schools, many teachers still rely on teaching\u2013\nlearning  methods  that  emphasize  the  acquisition  of  subject  knowledge  rather  than  the \ndevelopment  of  students\u2019  core  competencies.  Teachers  are  not  sufficiently  encouraged  to \ncollaborate in planning, preparing, and delivering lessons. Instructional resources to support \nteachers in adopting more student-centered and problem- and project-based methods are scarce, \nand the use of formative and diverse assessment measures to track student progress and devise \nindividualized instructional strategies is rare. Teachers use ICT more for delivering subject \nknowledge than for developing students\u2019 core competencies. While classrooms at urban and rural \nprimary schools and village primary teaching facilities can now be connected (para. 6), its \neffectiveness in developing core competencies, especially for students at village teaching facilities, \nis unknown given that their learning and home environments differ considerably, and joint \nplanning and preparation of lessons between these schools and teaching facilities are not \nconducted.  \n \n8.  These issues are common not only in Lanzhou and the rest of the PRC, but also in other \ncountries. More research is needed, for instance, on how the development of core competencies \ncould be integrated into the curriculum and lessons; what teaching, learning, and support systems \nand instructional resources could better help develop students\u2019 core competencies; how ICT could \nbe used to develop students\u2019 core competencies and adapt the curriculum to individual student \nneeds, without creating gender-based differences; and how ICT could be used to reduce gaps in \neducation service delivery and quality.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: high-quality and balanced primary education \ndelivered (footnotes 6 and 8). The TA will have the following outcome: enhanced ICT-enabled \nteaching,  learning,  and  support  systems  and  instructional  resources  in  primary  education \nincreased.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output  1:  Existing  teaching,  learning,  and  support  systems  and  instructional \nresources and use of information and communication technology in primary education \nassessed. The TA will support the assessment of existing (i) teaching, learning, and support \nsystems (i.e., the core competencies reflected in learning objectives, curricula, instructional \nstrategies,  assessment  and  standards,  organizational  structures,  instructional  leadership, \nteachers\u2019 professional development, culture, and environment); (ii) instructional resources (e.g., \ntextbooks, subject-knowledge materials, lesson plans, pedagogical materials, and assessment \ntools); and (iii) uses of ICT (e.g., hardware such as interactive whiteboards, multitouch tables, \nmovement sensors, mobile device, and computers; software such as apps for mobile device, and \neBooks; software as a service; and video); to develop students\u2019 core competencies and reduce \nrural\u2013urban disparities, as well as gender gaps, if any, in primary education. The assessment will \ncover  six  advanced  urban  primary  schools  and  seven  associated  village  primary  teaching \nfacilities.12 Gender-inclusive assessment framework and tools will be developed, considering         \n                                                \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 The six advanced urban primary schools are Dongjiao School, Lanzhou Branch of Beijing No. 2 Experimental Primary \nSchool, Lanzhou Experimental Primary School, Northwest Normal School-Affiliated Primary School, Qilihe Primary \n \n ", "4 \n(i) competency frameworks, including digital skills (coding and other ICT competencies), and \nscience, technology, engineering, and math skills; (ii) advanced teaching, learning, and support \nsystems, and good examples of instructional resources in primary education; (iii) common and \ncutting-edge technologies and uses (e.g., improved teaching\u2013learning processes and delivery, \npersonalized and adaptive content and curricula, assessments, open educational resources, \nteachers\u2019  professional  development,  communication  and  collaboration  tools,  interactive \nsimulations, and games) in the PRC and other relevant countries, to identify locally available good \npractices and assess their potential for scaling up, as well as to examine challenges in developing \nstudents\u2019 core competencies and reducing rural-urban disparities in primary education. Findings \nof the assessment will be discussed at workshops and seminars with provincial, municipal, district, \nand county education administrators; primary school principals and teachers; parents; teacher \ntraining and research institutes; and other stakeholders. \n \n11.  Output  2:  National  and  international  good  practices  and  lessons  in  building \nstudents\u2019 core competencies and addressing rural\u2013urban disparities in primary education \nthrough the use of information and communication technology introduced. The TA will \ncompile and present national and international good practices and lessons to address challenges \nidentified in the assessment (output 1) in building students\u2019 core competences and addressing \nrural\u2013urban disparities and gender gaps in primary education. It will support the organization of a \nconference where, case studies and research papers submitted and selected by issuing a call for \npapers nationally and internationally, dealing with the development of core competencies and \nreduction of rural\u2013urban disparities and gender gaps in primary education through the use of ICT, \nwill be presented. Case studies and research papers presented at the conference will be made \navailable on relevant websites and platforms. National and international (ADB member countries) \nstudy tours will be organized to provide opportunities for education administrators, primary school \nprincipals and teachers, and teacher training and research institutes in Lanzhou to learn from the \ngood practices and lessons presented at the conference.   \n \n12.  Output 3: New or improved information and communication technology-enabled \nteaching, learning, and support systems and instructional resources in primary education \npiloted. Based on the assessment (output 1) and the identified good practices and lessons \n(output 2), the TA will support, through two or three action research projects, the development of \nICT-enabled pilot teaching, learning, and support systems and instructional resources to improve \nstudents\u2019 core competencies and reduce rural\u2013urban disparities and gender gaps at the six \nadvanced urban primary schools and seven associated village primary teaching facilities. The \npilot teaching, learning, and support systems and instructional resources would incorporate latest \ntechnologies and combine various audiovisual and mobile devices via ICT platforms. As part of \nthe action research projects, measures to keep in phase with technological changes and to \ndevelop  and  maintain  ICT-enabled  systems  and  resources  will  be  examined,  and \nrecommendations for extending the systems and resources to other urban and rural primary \nschools and village primary teaching facilities will be made for provincial, municipal, district, and \n                                                \nSchool, and Ningwozhuang Primary School. These schools have been selected because they (i) represent different \ntypes of schools in terms of affiliation (Gansu Education Department, Lanzhou Municipal Bureau of Education, and \nuniversity) and location (Anning, Chengguan, and Qilihe districts); (ii) have ranked highly in school assessments on \nlearning environments, teachers, and students; and have experienced, progressive principals who train other \nprincipals; (iii) have been designated as national, provincial, or municipal in-service teacher-training bases; and \n(iv) have experience in provincial, national, and international experimental and research and development projects. \nVillage primary teaching facilities will be selected based on (i) the willingness of the principal to associate with an \nadvanced urban primary school, (ii) hard-to-reach location, (iii) the prospect of enrolling students for the next               \n3\u20135 years at minimum, (iv) the existence of one class for each grade, (v) teacher shortages, and (vi) teachers\u2019 \ncapacity to use ICT and willingness to conduct research and development activities. \n ", "5 \ncounty education administrators; primary school principals and teachers; parents; and teacher \ntraining and research institutes in Lanzhou and Gansu Province. \n \nC.
