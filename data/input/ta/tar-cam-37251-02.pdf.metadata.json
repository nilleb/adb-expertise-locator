In 2003, the Government of Cambodia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) to investigate how  infrastructure development and natural \nresource  management  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin  could  be  better  driven,  coordinated,  and \nstreamlined.  In  response,  ADB  provided  TA  to  design  and  plan  the  development  of  an \ninstitutional framework for integrated basin planning and management.1 Its primary output was a \ndesign for a basin management organization. A second output was a roadmap for establishing \nand effectively operating the basin management organization. A third output was an outline for a \nsecond TA to support the establishment of the basin management organization. On 16\u201323 \nSeptember 2004, an ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Cambodia to formulate the TA in line \nwith the program of actions formalized in the poverty reduction partnership agreement between \nthe Government and ADB and ADB\u2019s Tonle Sap basin strategy. The  Mission  reached  an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  goal,  purpose,  outputs, methodology and key \nactivities, cost and financing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for \nthe TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Tonle Sap ecosystem is the permanent core area of the Tonle Sap  and the \nsurrounding  floodplain,  and  lies  within  boundaries  constituted  by  the  upper  flood  lines.  It \nincludes the Tonle Sap River, its branches, and its floodplain. The Tonle Sap ecosystem is (i) \nthe main source of animal protein for much of the population  of Cambodia because of the \nproductive fisheries of the Tonle Sap, (ii) a direct and irreplaceable source of livelihoods for \nmore than 1 million people living on and around the Tonle Sap, (iii) a seasonal breeding and \nnursery ground and forage area for fish that subsequently migrate to the Mekong River, and (iv) \nan environmental hotspot of global significance. The Tonle Sap basin, defined as the catchment \narea of the Tonle Sap River at its confluence with the Mekong River, has an area of 85,000 \nsquare kilometers (km2), of which 80,000 km2 lie in Cambodia (5,000 km2 lie in Thailand). The \nTonle Sap basin includes all or part of 8 of Cambodia's 24 provinces.3 It extends over 44% of \nCambodia's total land area, including the Tonle Sap, and is home to 32% of Cambodia's total \npopulation, or about 3.6 million people (1998 figure). It is also a reservoir from which water \ndrains in the dry season to control salinity intrusion and conserve mangrove in the Mekong \nDelta.  However,  high  population  growth  is  increasing  the  number  of  people  to  feed,  and \nconsumptive use of the Tonle Sap basin\u2019s resources is intense. Threats to the Tonle Sap \ninclude  over-exploitation  of  fisheries  and  wildlife  resources,  encroachment  during  the  dry \nseason,  and  cutting  of  the  flooded  forest.  In  the  watersheds,  the  degradation  of  natural \nvegetation  is  destroying  habitats  and  resulting  in  deteriorating  water  and  soil  quality  and \nincreased  siltation  rates.  Limited  awareness  and  understanding  of  the  impacts  of  human \nactions, insufficient governance and  accountability systems, and inadequate mechanisms for \nmanagement  coordination  and  planning  compound  these  root  causes  of  degradation. \nConsequently, despite the inherent richness of the lake, most indicators of poverty are worse in \nthe basin than in the nation as a whole. Cambodia faces environmental disaster if the Tonle Sap \necosystem is degraded further. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.  Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Establishment of the Tonle Sap Basin \nManagement Organization. Manila. (TA No. 4212\u2013CAM, approved in the amount of $135,000 on 7 November \n2003.) \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 April 2004. \n3  The provinces are Banteay Meanchey,  Battambang, Kompong Chhnang, Kompong Thom, Oddar Meanchey, \nPreah Vihear, Pursat, and Siem Reap. ", "2 \n3.  In response,  in October 1997, the Government nominated the lake as a biosphere \nreserve covering 15,000 km2 under the Man and the Biosphere Program of the United Nations \nEducational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization.  In  September  2001,  the  Government \nestablished  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve  Secretariat4  to  serve  as  a  focal  point  for \nenvironmental management. In November 2002, ADB approved a loan and supporting TA for \nenvironmental management of the Tonle Sap.5 In July 2003, the Tonle Sap basin strategy6 was \nformulated to support the Country Strategy and Program, 2005\u20132007. This last initiative is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s water policy and a worldwide trend toward managing land, water, and \nbiotic resources within a framework of basin units, as demonstrated by the establishment of the \nInternational  Network  of  Basin  Organizations.  In  2003,  the  Network  of  Asian  River  Basin \nOrganizations was established at the initiative of ADB to improve the effectiveness of basin \nmanagement organizations in the region through increased information exchange, cooperation, \nand collaborative activities. \n \n4.  The  Cambodia  National  Mekong  Committee  (CNMC),7  with  a  membership  of  10 \nministries and a linkage with the Mekong River Commission, is responsible for promoting basin \nplanning and management that recognize the interconnectedness of social, economic, and \nenvironmental  factors.  However,  CNMC  has  experienced  difficulty  with  institutional \narrangements.  Typically,  line  agencies  define  goals  in  terms  of  quantitative  outputs,  not \noutcomes, for the subsectors over which they hold sway, but the complex dynamics of lakes \nrequire that their management be anticipatory, committed, and well planned over the long term. \nFurthermore, since 1996 the Government has been implementing a program of decentralization \nand deconcentration that culminated in February 2002 with the first-ever commune elections, \nand local governments and communities are becoming increasingly involved in local natural \nresource planning and management. The benefits are clear, but a devolution of authority does \nincrease  the  risk  that  actions  taken  in  one  province  will  affect  other  provinces.  Ensuring \nparticipation  demands  the  establishment  of  a  structure  that  involves  key  stakeholders.8 \nTherefore, in 2003, CNMC began to canvass local governments and communities to move \ntoward  some  form  of  basin  management  organization  consistent  with  the  basin  planning \nprocess of the Mekong River Commission.9 \n \n5.  The first TA (TA 4212\u2013CAM, footnote 1) was implemented from January through March \n2004. It determined that the preferred organizational model for the Tonle Sap basin should \ncomprise  a  basin  council  and  a  council  secretariat.  It  specified  their  mandates  and \nresponsibilities, including those of related sub-basin entities and their working arrangements,10 \n                                                 \n4  The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve Secretariat's mandate is to (i) serve as an information clearinghouse open to all, \n(ii) conduct a nationwide awareness and mobilization campaign in relation to the protection and sustainable use of \nthe Tonle Sap and its catchments, and (iii) effect cross-sectoral policy and strategy coordination. \n5  ADB. 2002.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nCambodia for the Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project. Manila. (Loan 1939\u2013CAM.) \n6  ADB. 2003. Fighting Poverty in Cambodia: The Tonle Sap Basin Strategy. Manila. The development objectives of \nthe Tonle Sap basin strategy are to foster, promote, and facilitate (i) pro-poor, sustainable economic growth, (ii) \naccess to assets, and (iii) management of natural resources and the environment. \n7  CNMC's mandate is to assist and advise the Government on all matters concerning the water and related natural \nresources of the Mekong River basin within Cambodia. CNMC is chaired by the minister of water resources and \nmeteorology. \n8  Stakeholders are people, groups, or institutions that may be affected by, can significantly influence, or are \nimportant to the achievement of the purpose of a development initiative. \n9  The Mekong River Commission\u2019s basin development plan aims to establish a planning framework of rules, policies, \nand processes to balance efficient use of resources with protection of the environment and promotion of social \njustice and equity. \n10 These would comprise sub-basin committees (SBCs), associated sub-basin technical facilitation teams (SBTFTs), \nand natural resource and environmental management sub-committees (NREMSCs). ", "3 \nand  outlined  a  roadmap  for  their  establishment  and  effective  operation.  The  TA's \nrecommendations were discussed and endorsed at an international consultative workshop held \nin Phnom Penh on 11 March 2004. CNMC endorsed TA 4212\u2013CAM\u2019s findings on 21 April 2004. \nIt also filled out a TA completion questionnaire that evaluated TA 4212\u2013CAM\u2019s key activities and \noutputs, identified lessons learned, and suggested follow-up action. Feedback from CNMC \ninformed the design of the current TA, which marks the first step in implementing the roadmap. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n6.  The goal of the TA is sound management of natural resources and the environment in \nthe Tonle Sap basin. Its purpose is to advance the establishment of improved institutional and \norganizational arrangements for managing land, water, and biotic resources in the Tonle Sap \nbasin. The TA will complement the suite of loan and TA projects that ADB promotes under the \nTonle Sap Initiative.11 Two outputs will accomplish the TA\u2019s purpose (i) the finalization of the \ndesign for a Tonle Sap basin management organization, and (ii) the design of  sub-basin \ninstitutional structures. The TA will also advance the roadmap set out by TA 4212\u2013CAM and \noutline further TA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The methodology of the TA will be consultative. TA 4212\u2013CAM was implemented over 3 \nmonths and final, broad consensus in relation to the functions and structures of the Tonle Sap \nBasin Council (TSBC) and the TSBC Secretariat must still be built. Only after this consensus \nhas been built can CNMC propose the new legislation that will establish the TSBC and TSBC \nSecretariat. CNMC's constituent members will agree to the final structure of the Tonle Sap basin \norganization  at  a  workshop  held  2  weeks  after  the  start  of  the  TA.  Extensive  field-level \nconsultations  are  also  needed  to  detail  the  SBCs,  SBTFTs,  NREMSCs.  The  consultative \nprocess will be enabled by the establishment of (i) a central working group incorporating the \nmain constituent members of CNMC  and representatives of the provinces in the Tonle Sap \nbasin, and (ii) a working group within each province concerned primarily with the design of the \nSBCs,  SBTFTs,  and  NREMSCs,  and  consisting  of  provincial,  district,  and  commune \nrepresentatives  together  with  representatives  from  water  user  and  farmer  groups, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  others  as  appropriate.  Broader  consultations  with  key \nstakeholders will be effected by conducting workshops to discuss and make recommendations \non the midterm report and elicit feedback on the draft final report. The TA will be coordinated \nwith other water-related projects being undertaken by bilateral and multilateral development \ninstitutions and nongovernment organizations. \n \n8.  Finalizing  the  Design  of  a  Tonle  Sap  Basin  Management  Organization.  To \naccomplish this output, key activities will (i) promote agreement on the final structure of a Tonle \nSap basin management organization; (ii) spell out the requirements for a robust and effective \nregulatory framework to underpin basin management; (iii) specify mechanisms for raising public \nawareness and understanding of the need to manage land, water, and biotic resources in the \nTonle Sap basin; (iv) develop institutional and policy arrangements for the TSBC; (v) elaborate \nthe organizational structure and operating protocols for the TSBC; (vi) prepare a statement of \nthe  TSBC's  responsibilities,  including  its  role  in  resource  planning  and  management; \n                                                 \n11 The Tonle Sap Initiative is a partnership of organizations and people working to meet the poverty and environment \nchallenges of the Tonle Sap based on the Tonle Sap basin strategy. ", "4 \n(vii) elaborate  the  organizational  structure  and  operating  protocols  for  an  office  of  basin \nmanagement; (viii) prepare a detailed description of the accountabilities and responsibilities of \nthe TSBC Secretariat; and (ix) specify changes to existing legislation and any new legislation \nrequired to give effect to the TSBC and its Secretariat. \n \n9.  Designing  Sub-Basin  Institutional  Structures.  To  accomplish  this  output,  key \nactivities  will  (i)  analyze  existing  arrangements  for  natural  resource  and  environmental \nmanagement at the provincial level and below;12 (ii) develop the institutional and organizational \narrangements for the SBCs, SBTFTs, and NREMSCs;13 (iii) conduct a comparative analysis of \nall sub-basins and identify criteria for selecting a pilot SBC, which will be a primary focus of \ncontinuing TA; (iv) recommend the structures, membership, and operating protocols of the \nSBCs, SBTFTs, and NREMSCs; (v) prepare for the establishment of the pilot SBC. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $360,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $233,000 and a local currency cost of $127,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas  requested  ADB  to  finance  $300,000  equivalent,  which  represents  the  entire  foreign \nexchange cost and $67,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $60,000, mainly by remunerating and providing per diems for \ncounterpart  staff  and  providing  office  accommodation  and  transport.  Details  of  the  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  CNMC will be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA. Two international consultants with \nexpertise in river basin management (5 person-months) and institutions (5 person-months) will \nbe engaged individually to undertake the TA. They will carry out their work in two inputs of 3.5 \nmonths and 1.5 months, respectively, with a gap of 1 month in between. The  river basin \nmanagement specialist will act as team leader and will take overall responsibility for delivering \nkey activities and accomplishing outputs. In particular, he or she will be directly responsible for \nfinalizing the design of a Tonle Sap basin management organization. The institutions specialist \nwill be directly responsible for designing sub-basin institutional structures. The team leader will \nhave  advanced  leadership,  managerial,  diplomatic,  and  negotiating  skills  and  a  history  of \nmanaging for results. Both international consultants will be familiar with the circumstances of the \nTonle Sap basin, such as its complex poverty-environment nexus. Both will be sensitive to \ngender issues and able to mainstream gender considerations into institutional design.14 In \naddition, about 15 person-months of short-term domestic consultants with knowledge of specific \nbasin issues will be engaged as needed. Their exact composition will be identified during TA \ninception. CNMC will assign counterpart staff to facilitate day-to-day administration of the TA \nand liaise with CNMC\u2019s constituent members. At ADB, a project officer with suitable expertise \nwill be assigned to administer the TA and monitor its progress. All consultants will be engaged \n                                                 \n12 This activity will consider how organizations work and explore their connections to natural resource management. It \nwill also ascertain how organizations are shaped by gender-defined roles and relationships. This is central to \ndetermining gender-sensitive structures, memberships, and operating protocols for the  SBCs, SBTFTs, and \nNREMSCs. \n13 This activity will include preparation of a gender action plan. The action plan will  introduce mechanisms for \nequitable participation by women in the SBCs, SBTFTs, and NREMSCs. \n14 Effective management of natural resources entails ensuring that the disparate voices of all stakeholders are heard \nand engaged in decisions. The majority of these are women. ", "5 \non an individual basis in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the \nAsian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. They will operate from the CNMC Secretariat in Phnom \nPenh.  A  key  activities  and  indicative  staffing  schedule  is  in  Appendix  3.  Outline  terms  of \nreference are in Appendix 4. Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \nfor Procurement. \n \n12.  The  consultants  will  produce  (i)  an  inception  report  within  4  weeks  of  the \ncommencement of the TA; (ii) a midterm report within 14 weeks;15 (iii) a draft final report within \n20 weeks; and (iv) a final report detailing TA outcomes and future actions, which will take into \naccount ADB\u2019s comments on the draft final report, within 24 weeks. CNMC will fill out a TA \ncompletion questionnaire to evaluate key activities and outputs, identify lessons learned, and \nsuggest follow-up action. The TA\u2019s deliverables will be disseminated through the information \nnetworks of CNMC and its constituent members, particularly the Ministry of Water Resources \nand  Meteorology.  ADB\u2019s  information  networks  include  the  biannual  Tonle  Sap  Initiative \nbrochure16 and the Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project web site.17 The TA will be \nimplemented over a period of 6 months starting in January 2005 and ending in July 2005. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n13.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia  for  Establishment  of  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin  Management \nOrganization II, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n15 The midterm report will be distributed widely to key stakeholders. Following a 1-month review period, a workshop \nwill be held to discuss its recommendations. \n16 ADB. Various years. Future Solutions Now: The Tonle Sap Initiative.
