INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will support regional cooperation and development in \nNortheast Asia (NEA) by providing knowledge solutions that help remove key constraints faced \nby the subregion, and facilitate knowledge exchanges and institutional capacity building to tackle \nregional issues and challenges. \n \n2.  The TA is not included in the country operations business plans of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and for Mongolia. But it is in line with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030  with  a  focus  on  one  of  the  seven  operational  priorities:  fostering  regional \ncooperation and integration (RCI). The TA will contribute to the connectivity in the region and \nincrease support for regional public goods and collective actions to mitigate cross-border risks \nsuch as climate change, pollution, energy and water insecurity, and communicable and infectious \ndiseases.1 The design of the TA follows ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration (2016\u20132020)2 and Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The NEA subregion encompasses highly diverse and divergent economies, including \neastern Mongolia, northeastern PRC, the Russian Far East, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan. \nThe subregion has enormous potential for investment and trade-led growth supported by rich \nmineral resources, a skilled labor pool in the PRC and Mongolia, and favorable geographical \nconditions for inter- and intra-regional transport. Some member countries of the NEA subregion \nhave achieved remarkable economic development through outward-oriented growth. However, \nthe subregion is still one of the least-integrated parts of the world and facing increasingly complex \ndevelopment challenges such as growing disparity in incomes and living standards, natural \ndisasters arising from climate change, food insecurity, and transboundary health risks. \n \n4.  Regional  cooperation  is  critically  important  in  tackling  these  common  challenges, \nredressing inequalities, and realizing the subregion\u2019s economic potential. A more integrated NEA \ncould unleash the potential to serve as a gateway for resource-rich but landlocked inner Asia to \nget access to global markets, helping promote essential economic diversification and employment \ngeneration. Stronger RCI is needed to drive joint responses to those challenges. The business \ncommunity is also interested in a predictable, transparent, and favorable business environment \nwith harmonized rules and regulations. \n \n5.  However, regional cooperation between NEA countries has lagged mainly because of \nprolonged historic and political tensions. In addition, NEA lacks effective regional cooperation \nmechanisms that enable communication and knowledge exchange for concerted development \nstrategies. Unlike other subregions in Asia, NEA also lacks a functioning regional cooperation \nknowledge platform that can coordinate studies and evaluations of common issues and propose \npolicies for effective response. As evident from the experiences of other subregional programs \nlike the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program4 and the Greater \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 November 2018. \n2  ADB. 2016. Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. \n4  The CAREC Program is a partnership of 11 countries (Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Mongolia, Pakistan, the PRC, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan), supported by six multilateral \ninstitutions working together to promote development through cooperation, leading to accelerated growth and poverty \nreduction. CAREC helps Central Asia and its neighbors realize their significant potential by promoting regional \ncooperation in four priority areas: transport, trade facilitation, energy, and trade policy. As CAREC member countries, \n ", "2 \nMekong Subregion,5 trade facilitation, better infrastructure connectivity and logistics, and effective \npolicy coordination are vital for addressing the issues highlighted above. \n \n6.  Despite limited participation and resources from its four member countries\u2014the PRC, \nMongolia, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and the Russian Federation\u2014the Greater Tumen \nInitiative (GTI)6 is one existing mechanism for facilitating transport and energy connectivity. It has \nthe potential to enable full exploitation of economic complementarities and to serve as an \nimportant bridge for greater cooperation in the subregion. The GTI could also be instrumental in \nfostering knowledge exchange and support between the NEA countries because, since its \ninception in 1995, it has contributed to the regional dialogue and to promoting knowledge sharing \nfor effective regional cooperation through high-quality research. \n \n7.  The GTI has published a series of regional infrastructure studies, among them Trans-\nGreater Tumen Region (GTR) Transport Corridors: Financing Infrastructure Development7 and \nIntegrated  Transport  Infrastructure  and  Cross-border  Facilitation  Study  for  the  Trans-GTR \nTransport Corridors.8 The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific  (UNESCAP)  promotes  NEA  subregional  development  through  the  annual  NEA \nDevelopment Forum and published a flagship report on Unlocking the Potential for East and \nNorth-East Asian Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration.9 Japan\u2019s Economic Research \nInstitute for NEA publishes an academic journal, The Northeast Asian Economic Review,10 \ncovering various aspects of NEA subregional economic issues. A working paper of the ADB \nInstitute, Financing Development Cooperation in Northeast Asia,11 discusses the financial hurdles \nfor the subregion\u2019s development. However, the knowledge work is still insufficient and so far has \ngiven little attention to rapidly evolving cross-border issues such as health problems, climate \nchange and disaster risks, or NEA-specific infrastructure demand and financing solutions. What \nis also missing is an effective knowledge-sharing platform to disseminate quality research and \nstudies to NEA countries and other stakeholders. \n \n8.  The TA will address these gaps. It will help realize the potential for deeper NEA regional \ncooperation, and is well aligned with member countries\u2019 regional cooperation initiatives and \nnational development strategies. The Belt and Road Initiative, begun in 2013 as the PRC\u2019s \nflagship  regional  cooperation  and  connection  strategy,  is  building  infrastructure-connecting \ncorridors. The Government of the PRC upgraded the Changchun-Jilin-Tumen Guide Area plan to \n                                                \nthe PRC and Mongolia also benefit from CAREC initiatives to improve connectivity and trade facilitation, which can \nbe further extended to the entire NEA subregion once an effective NEA subregional RCI platform is in place. \n5  The Greater Mekong Subregion is a natural economic area bound together by the Mekong River and formed by \nCambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, the PRC (specifically Yunnan Province and Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region), Thailand, and Viet Nam. In 1992, with assistance from ADB, the six countries entered \ninto a program of subregional economic cooperation. \n6  Originally known as the Tumen River Area Development Programme, the GTI is an intergovernmental cooperation \nmechanism between Mongolia, the PRC, the ROK, and the Russian Federation, supported by the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme. In 1995, GTI member governments signed agreements to establish this mechanism, \naimed  at  strengthening  economic  and  technical  cooperation,  and  attaining  greater  growth  and  sustainable \ndevelopment in NEA and especially the Greater Tumen Region (GTR). In particular, the GTI focuses on the priority \nareas of transport, trade and investment, tourism, agriculture, and energy, with environment as a crosscutting sector. \n7  GTI. 2014.

Mongolia developed the Prairie Road Program (also known as the Steppe Road \nProgram) in November 2014 to stimulate economic growth by improving trade and transport in an \nincreasingly integrated NEA. The ROK has also been stepping up economic cooperation with the \nRussian  Federation  and  other  NEA  countries  under  its  New  Northern  Policy,  launching  a \nPresidential Committee on Northern Economic Cooperation. \n \n9.  The TA will produce knowledge products, provide knowledge services, and promote \nknowledge-sharing and capacity-building opportunities. It will focus on (i) supporting needed \nresearch and studies on demand-based subregional infrastructure investment financing and NEA \ncross-border challenges, such as those related to environment, food, health, trade facilitation, and \ndisaster  risks;  and  (ii)  organizing  knowledge-sharing  and  capacity-building  programs  for \ngovernment  officials,  the  private  sector,  and  other  stakeholders  (including  other  regional \ncooperation platforms such as CAREC) to increase awareness and knowledge of NEA regional \ncooperation, and to boost dialogue and communication in the subregion.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: NEA subregional economic potential realized \n(footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: effective NEA subregional cooperation \nknowledge platform established.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n(i)  Output 1: NEA regional development research and studies prepared. The TA \nwill  provide  support  to  individual  researchers  and/or  research  institutions  to \nconduct  studies  in  the  areas  of  regional  infrastructure  development  and \nconnectivity aligned with ongoing regional connectivity activities within and outside \nof ADB,13 trade facilitation, environmental challenges, health, climate change, \ndisaster risks, digital connectivity and innovations, and other areas. The TA team \nwill publish the outputs of the studies in printed or digital form, depending on the \npreference of stakeholders. It will also support policy dialogues and stakeholder \nconsultations through meetings, workshops, and conferences. \n \n(ii)  Output  2:  Knowledge  of  and  capacity  for  regional  cooperation  in  NEA \ndeveloping  member  countries  improved.  The  TA  will  promote  knowledge \nsharing and institutional capacity building for RCI in the NEA subregion. It will \nprovide resources needed to improve knowledge-sharing and capacity-building \nactivities, including training programs, seminars, workshops, conferences, and \ntranslation of publications for NEA developing member countries. The TA will also \nsupport  a  consultation  process  to  establish  a  sustainable  NEA  subregional \nknowledge-sharing  platform  to  continue  beyond  the  TA  period,  and  support \nexisting subregional cooperation initiatives such as the GTI research network.  \n \n                                                \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 https://www.unescap.org/our-work/transport/trans-asian-railway/about and https://www.unescap.org/our-\nwork/transport/asian-highway/about. \n ", "4 \nC.
