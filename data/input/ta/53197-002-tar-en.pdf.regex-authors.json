INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will improve the production system, \nproductivity, and competitiveness of Armenia\u2019s agriculture sector. It will promote holistic value \nchain development for high-value crops from production to market. It will also increase the \ninstitutional capacity of sector agencies to develop and adopt appropriate policies and regulations \nto unlock the potential of the agriculture sector.1 \n \n2.  The Government of Armenia has requested the assistance of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to revitalize the agriculture sector through enhancing value addition by diversifying \nand increasing the productivity of high-value crops.2 The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nin promoting rural development and food security through (i) improving market connectivity and \nagricultural value chain linkages, (ii) increasing agricultural productivity and food security, and (iii) \nenhancing food safety.3 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Armenia supports an export-\noriented  and  inclusive  economy  meeting  high  technological,  industrial,  and  environmental \nstandards.4 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Agriculture\u2019s share of Armenia\u2019s gross domestic product has declined in recent years, from \n18% in 2012 to 14% in 2018. However, agriculture continues to provide a significant source of \nemployment, employing 33.3% of the labor force in 2018; women provided about 56% of \nagricultural labor.6 According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, Armenia\u2019s agricultural \nland  totals  2.04 million  hectares  (ha),  but  only  22%  (446,000  ha)  is  arable.  Agriculture  is \npredominantly  smallholder-based,  with  an  average  landholding  of  1.5  ha.  Crop  production \naccounts for 72% and livestock production accounts for 28% of agricultural value added. In 2017, \nthe distribution of area harvested by crop was cereals (32%); fruit (49%); vegetables, roots, and \npulses (17%); and nuts (1%).7 Growth in agriculture is constrained by low-value crops, low \nproductivity, limited connectivity and weak market linkages, inadequate public investment, and \nsporadic support services. Less than 30% of arable land has irrigation facilities. Armenia is a net \nimporter of agricultural and food products, with exports of $697 million and imports of $726 million \nin 2018. The level of Armenia\u2019s self-sufficiency is low for some key products\u2014in particular, 33% \nfor wheat products, 58% for pork products, and 23% for poultry products. \n \n4.  The sector has suffered from limited access to good quality land, specialized agricultural \nmachinery, appropriate inputs, modern technologies, market information, modern distribution \nmethods, commercial finance, and crop insurance. The agricultural value chain is characterized \nby rudimentary marketing and transportation infrastructure, weak linkages between value chain \nactors, and limited and technologically poor storage and processing capacity. There is no strategic \ncoordination  of  wholesale  market  activity  at  the  national  level.  All  markets  nationwide  are \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 July 2019. \n2  The TA may consider livestock production, processing, and marketing, subject to further assessment during \nimplementation. \n3  ADB. 2018.

Public investment in agricultural research and \ndevelopment, extension services, and agribusiness development has been negligible, and private \nsector efforts are limited. Linkages with agricultural universities and academic institutions are \nweak. In the horticulture subsector, productivity is low because the industry is highly fragmented. \nProducers are predominantly individual farmers and small enterprises with no access to advanced \nhorticultural  techniques,  productive  seeds,  effective  plant  nutrients  and  pesticides,  efficient \nlogistics,  and  appropriate  financial  resources  and  services.  In  addition,  the  industry  faces \nemerging challenges, such as shortage of arable land and water resources, greater focus on \nenvironmental protection, frequent natural disasters that increase price volatility, insufficient \nagricultural infrastructure, low incomes for rural farmers, and a growing need for rural reform to \nensure the sector\u2019s development. \n \n5.  Armenia\u2019s agriculture sector is highly susceptible to climate change, given its mountainous \nterrain, slow adoption of climate change adaptation and mitigation, and small area of arable land. \nThe subsistence nature of agricultural production has led to unsustainable production practices \nand overgrazing of pastures, causing serious soil erosion. About 80% of agricultural land is \nsubject to some form of degradation. About 20% of arable land is eroded, and salinity affects \nabout 20% of the irrigated area. Projections indicate that by 2030, climate hazards such as \ndecreased and more variable precipitation, higher temperatures, and reduced river runoff could \nresult in reduced, less certain, and lower crop and livestock yields and/or crop failure. Crop and \nlivestock yields could drop by an estimated 7%\u201324%.8 The extent and degree of losses in crop \nand livestock outputs would negatively impact the Armenian economy, because agriculture is the \nmain source of livelihoods for Armenia\u2019s rural population. \n \n6.  Opportunities.  Armenia  has  the  potential  to  raise  agricultural  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness, despite the degradation of agricultural land. Armenia\u2019s climate is similar to that \nof the world\u2019s leading fruit and vegetable export regions. Armenia is also strategically located to \nbenefit from international trade in high-value crops. To promote agricultural trade, Armenia signed \na Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement in November 2017, which aims to \nstrengthen political and economic cooperation. Armenia also benefits from the Generalised \nScheme of Preferences (GSP+) of the European Union (EU): under the GSP+, the total value of \npreferential imports from Armenia into the EU increased from \u20ac42 million in 2014 to \u20ac135 million \nin 2017.9 Through these agreements, Armenia is expected to be able to transform its fragmented \nand subsistence-based agriculture sector to one that is profitable, competitive, and export-\noriented. The Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) also offers opportunities for growth and a market \nof about 183 million people. Armenia acceded to the EEU in 2015; previously, it already had \nseveral free trade agreements with EEU member countries. \n \n7.  Government\u2019s sector strategy. In February 2019, the government released a new \neconomic development strategy.10 In agriculture, the strategy aims to increase productivity, \nintroduce  modern  technologies,  improve  food  quality  and  safety  standards,  enhance \ncompetitiveness, increase exports, and raise the incomes of all value chain participants. The TA \nwill help implement the strategy and its sector-specific policy initiatives, including the draft \nStrategy for Sustainable Agricultural Development (Vision 2029) under review by the government \nas of October 2019. \n                                                \n8  World Bank. 2014.

The TA will have the following outcome: production and marketing of high-value \ncrops increased.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  The outputs of the TA will be: (i) policies and regulations for high-value crop diversification \nimproved and (ii) suitable financing mechanisms for high-value crop diversification developed. \n \n10.  Output 1: Policies and regulations for high-value crop diversification improved. The \nTA will help the Ministry of Economy formulate policies, regulations, and related implementation \nand monitoring mechanisms to help diversify, improve productivity, and realize export potential \nfor  high-value  crops.  Through  analysis  of  constraints  and  opportunities  in  producing  and \nmarketing high-value crops and consultation with sector stakeholders, the TA will recommend a \nrange  of  high-value  crops  that meets  market demand  and suits  Armenia\u2019s  agro-ecological \nconditions, and propose a strategy to promote identified crops in domestic and international \nmarkets.In parallel, the TA will elaborate a systematic approach to (i) enhance land administration, \n \n(ii) develop agricultural value chain infrastructure, and (iii) improve agricultural competitiveness \nand  risk  mitigation  and  management,  and  increase  exports  to  EU  markets,  including \nenhancement of transport links to export markets through regional cooperation. Throughout, the \nTA  will  assess  the  constraints,  opportunities,  and  appropriate  policy  initiatives  to  enhance \nparticipation and income-earning potential for women in high-value crop production and marketing. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Suitable  financing  mechanisms  for  high-value  crop  diversification \ndeveloped.  The  TA  will  first  conduct  a  gap  analysis  of  current  financing  and  institutional \narrangements for agricultural value chain development. The TA will also review best international \npractices of financing and private and/or public\u2013private investment mechanisms suitable to \nmodernize agriculture and diversify crops, including risk management instruments for value-chain \nfinancing, e.g., repurchase agreements, trade receivables finance, trader finance, warehouse \nreceipts, and commodity finance. Farm-specific assessments will evaluate farmers\u2019 financial and \ntechnical capacity and the farming system\u2019s suitability for high-value crop diversification. The \nassessments will review the role of women in high-value crop farming and identify financing \nmechanisms to enhance the participation of women as entrepreneurs, not only as providers of \nlabor. Based on the analyses, the TA will:  \n(i)   recommend financing and institutional mechanisms for  \n(a)   provision  of  agricultural  value  chain  infrastructure,  in  particular,  lease \nfinance and alternative financing modalities for harvest- and post-harvest \nfacilities and other farming and marketing facilities; and  \n(b)   crop production, insurance, processing, and storage, with potential public\u2013\nprivate partnership or full private sector financing;  \n(ii)   prepare and implement a plan to increase the capacity of relevant agencies for \nnew financing mechanisms; and  \n(iii)   develop an investment project proposal for high-value crop diversification, which \nwill  include  innovative  features,  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation \nmeasures, gender development, and relevant thematic issues. \n                                                \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \n \n12.  Lessons and ADB\u2019s value addition. Lessons from both in-country and regional sector \noperations call for the critical need to (i) adopt a medium-term approach informed by a greater \nunderstanding of the complexity of reforms and the capacity of institutions to implement reforms; \n(ii) ensure continuity in capacity-building support; (iii) develop modern production, post-harvest, \nand marketing systems; (iv) follow an integrated value chain development approach to maximize \noverall productivity and efficiency gains; and (v) promote collaboration between key value chain \nactors led by the private sector to facilitate horizontal and vertical integration and reduce the state \nfiscal burden. The TA will address critical areas that constrain Armenia\u2019s capacity to enhance \ncompetitiveness of agriculture. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space and utilities, meeting venue, data \nand information access, coordination with government agencies, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The Ministry of Economy will be the executing agency. ADB \nwill  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate  consultants.  The  Environment,  Natural  Resources  and \nAgriculture Division of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department will be the focal point in ADB for \nthe TA implementation.  \n \n15.
