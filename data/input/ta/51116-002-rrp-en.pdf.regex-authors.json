THE PROPOSAL  \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Yangtze  River  Green  Ecological  Corridor \nComprehensive  Agriculture  Development  Project.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  five \nprovinces and one municipality in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River Basin, \nnotably  the  provinces  of  Guizhou,  Hubei,  Hunan,  Sichuan,  and  Yunnan;  and  Chongqing \nMunicipality.1 The proposed project will promote sustainable and modern farming systems to \nenhance productivity, reduce nonpoint source (NPS) pollution and environmental degradation, \nand strengthen institutional capacity for coordinated natural resources management. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) covers nine provinces and two specially \nadministered cities within the Yangtze River Basin. It accounts for more than 40% of the entire \nPRC population, has 40% of the freshwater resources, serves as the drinking water resource for \n400 million people, provides 60% of total fisheries production, has 20% of the total wetland area, \nand already contributes about 45% of the PRC\u2019s economic output. Based on its demographic and \ngeographic assets, the PRC government has earmarked YREB as one of the three key growth \nengines  to  ensure  the  PRC\u2019s  future  economic  development.2 However,  development  and \neconomic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the YREB are still undermined by (i) slow \ntransformation into green development and economic diversification; (ii) limited integration of \nwaterways, ports, and intermodal logistics; (iii) increasing pollution and pressure on natural \nresources; and (iv) weak institutional coordination for strategic planning.3 \n3.  To  address  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  formulated  the  YREB \ndevelopment plan 2016\u20132030,4 which stipulated the prioritization of ecological protection and \npromotion of green development as the guiding principle for the YREB development.5 In this \nconnection, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the government have agreed to adopt a \nframework approach, providing about $2.0 billion of funding in the YREB during 2018\u20132020 to \nstrategically program ADB\u2019s lending support for development initiatives in the YREB with priority \ngiven to the following four areas: (i) ecosystem restoration, environmental protection, and water \nresources management; (ii) green and inclusive industrial transformation; (iii) construction of an \nintegrated multimodal transport corridor; and (iv) institutional strengthening and policy reform. \n4.  In  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  the  YREB,  the  traditional  modes  of  economic \ndevelopment strongly rely on the rural economy and primary sector. However, unsustainable \nproduction practices continue to cause environmental degradation and limit the opportunities for \nimproving rural livelihoods. This has severely impacted the water resources that the quality of the \n                                                \n1  Selection criteria included: low and medium agricultural productivity; high risk and occurrence of soil erosion; high \nlevels of agricultural nonpoint source pollution; lack of or outdated infrastructure; and the opportunity to implement \nintegrated watershed management in counties with poverty alleviation priority. The selection criteria and process are \nsummarized in Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n2  The other flagship projects are the Belt and Road Initiative and the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Integration. \n3  ADB. 2016.

Beijing. \n5  Green development aims to (i) change the traditional development model to a sustainable development model; (ii) \naddress the challenges of rapid urbanization; and (iii) serve as a guide to socioeconomic development. \n ", "2 \nriver  water  suffers  from  increasing  NPS  pollution because  of  excessive  levels  of  nitrogen, \n \nphosphorus,  and  pesticide  entering  water  bodies  through  agricultural  chemical  runoff. 6 \nAgricultural intensification has degraded the land resources, driven by changes to land use, \ndeforestation, diminished water availability and quality, soil erosion, and reduced soil quality from \noveruse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The loss of agricultural productivity as a result of \nland degradation in the PRC amounts to an estimated $37.09 billion per year.7 Moreover, \nagriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change. Coping with significant variability in future \nclimatic impacts requires efficient water resource management, increased capacity of agricultural \nsupport institutions and stakeholders, improvement of the support services to farmers, and more \nresilient production and ecosystems. \n5.  The provinces of Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Yunnan; and the Chongqing \nMunicipality support large rural populations and have an agrarian rural economy.8 Agriculture, \nanimal husbandry, and fisheries are the main sources of livelihood for the 156.34 million people \nliving in these rural areas, but their per capita disposable income of CNY8,090\u2013CNY12,725 is \nonly 31%\u201343% of that of their urban counterparts.9 While the terrains vary\u2014ranging from steep \nand high mountains to valley bottoms near rivers\u2014they can all be characterized by outdated \nagricultural production systems and practices, with inefficient use of land and water resources, \nhigh rate of land conversions, prevalent soil erosion, excessive fertilizer and pesticide use, \noutdated  or  lacking  infrastructure,  intensive  livestock  production  with  improper  waste \nmanagement and disposal practices, and lack of adequate extension services. The difficult terrain, \npoor land management practices, and limited opportunities to adopt modern and better practices \nhave caused widespread environmental degradation, which is further exacerbated by a changing \nclimate and extreme weather conditions, posing significant challenges for achieving sustainable \nagriculture and enhancing agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods. \n6.  Modernizing the agriculture sector is aligned with the National Agricultural Sustainable \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132030 and focuses on investments in (i) the protection of water and soil \nresources, such  as  construction  of  high-standard farmland,  protection and  improvement  of \ncultivated farmland, provision of efficient, water-saving irrigation, and monitoring of agricultural \nresources;  (ii)  agricultural  and  rural  environmental  control,  specifically  waste  management, \nchemical fertilizer and pesticide control, recycling and reuse of agricultural film and pesticide \npackaging,  straw  utilization,  and  rural  environmental  integrated  management;  and  (iii) \nenvironmental rehabilitation.10  \n7.  Currently,  provincial  agencies  have  limited  opportunity  to  cooperate  on  agricultural \ndevelopment and natural resource management, and to coordinate rural economic development \nacross the YREB because of (i) fragmented responsibilities for natural resource management \n                                                \n6  B.

For the country as a \nwhole, the rural population contributes 42.6% and the primary industry contributes 8.6% to the national GDP. \n9  The provincial per capita GDP is as follows: Guizhou (CNY33,246), Hunan (CNY46,382), Hubei (CNY55,665), \nSichuan (CNY40,003), and Yunnan (CNY31,093). The per capita GDP of Chongqing Municipality is CNY58,502. The \nnational per capita GDP is CNY53,980. \n10 Released on 20 May 2015 by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Ministry of \nFinance, the Ministry of Land and Resources, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Water \nResources, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the State Forestry Administration.  \n \n ", "3 \nacross the various agencies, (ii) competing priorities and policies within and across sectors, and \n(iii) limited options and mechanisms for upstream\u2013downstream coordination. A new approach is \nneeded to achieve integrated management and green development that can balance natural \nresource management; improve agricultural productivity and thus food security; and increase the \nresilience  of  the  environment  and  people. This  will  require (i)  synergies  with  other  social, \neconomic, and environmental objectives; (ii) enhanced cooperation and coordination within and \nbetween provinces beyond administrative barriers; (iii) responsible and inclusive governance; \n(iv) organized planning; and (v) stronger institutional capacity and cooperation. \n8.  The \u201cGreen Ecological Corridor\u201d is an integrated management approach that aims to unite \nmanagement and development priorities within the YREB. It aims to restore ecological health by \nmanaging the functional ecological zones, strengthening water source protection, applying soil \nand water conservation, and putting in place risk prevention and control measures.11 This requires \na combination of policy support, targeted research, financial incentives such as eco-compensation, \nand structural mechanisms to promote integrated and sustainable farming systems to protect and \nrehabilitate the ecological environment while promoting green economic development.12 Applied \nat the scale of the watershed, which serves as the natural environmental management unit, it can \nenable comprehensive and unified management of natural resources as well as cooperation to \nshare  experiences  and  lessons,  and  focus  on  green  growth  rather  than  the  traditional \ndevelopment model.  \n9.  In line with the State Council\u2019s guidelines to build an \u201cecological civilization\u201d,13 the National \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  prepared the  YREB  Development  Plan  2016\u20132030, \nemphasizing green development, environmental protection, rehabilitation, and management of \nwater resources (footnote 4). The plan specifically aims to (i) facilitate conservation and highly \nefficient  utilization  of  natural  resources;  (ii)  strengthen  management  efforts  to  improve \nenvironmental quality as the core purpose; and (iii) prioritize ecological protection and restoration, \nand the strengthening of water environmental management.14  \n10.  Strategic fit. The project will protect the ecological environment, improve water security, \nincrease resilience to climate change, and improve the livelihoods of people. Thus, it is consistent \nwith (i) the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, which aims to realize \u201cecological \ncivilization\u201d;15 (ii) the National Agricultural Sustainable Development Plan, 2015\u20132030 (footnote \n10), which promotes agricultural reform and modernization; (iii) ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030\u2019s operational \npriorities for rural development and food security and strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity;16 (iv) the country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, which aims to improve \nthe PRC\u2019s environment and manage climate change by realizing \u201cecological civilization\u201d;17 (v) \nADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020, which aims to increase efficiency and productivity in \n                                                \n11  Government of the PRC. 2016.

The provincial and county governments will finance civil works, training and \ncapacity development activities, monitoring, and taxes and duties; and will ensure that the \ncounterpart funds for the project are provided in a timely manner. The beneficiaries will finance \nthe costs for tending and maintaining the protection trees over a 3-year establishment phase, \nwhich will include labor and inputs such as fertilizer, pesticides, and equipment. \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  300.0  59.2 \nProvincial and county governments  155.0  30.6 \nCentral government  18.6  3.7 \nBeneficiaries  33.1  6.5 \nTotal  506.8  100.0 \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "7 \n21.  Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $63 million and climate adaptation is estimated to \ncost $197 million. ADB will finance 60.3% of mitigation costs and 59.8% of adaptation costs.  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The  Office  for  Comprehensive  Agriculture  Development  is  the  National  Project \nManagement Office (NPMO) in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs which will be the \nexecuting agency responsible for the overall planning, financial management, coordination, and \nmanagement  of  the  project.27 The  Provincial  Project  Management  Office  (PPMO)  of  each \n \nparticipating project province and municipality will be the implementing agency responsible for \ndaily project preparation and management, procurement of works and goods, and maintenance \nof project accounts. The County Project Management Offices (CPMO) will serve as the project \nimplementation units, which will be responsible for the daily implementation of project activities \nand quality control. The proposed institutional arrangements are based on the ADB-financed \nComprehensive Agriculture Development Project (footnote 23) and take into account five key \nlessons: first, to effectively coordinate and manage project activities across multiple provinces, \noverall  coordination  at  the  state  level  is  required.  Second,  already  being  responsible  for \nagricultural infrastructure investment and development projects, the PPMOs and CPMOs have \nexisting skills in procurement and will be able to quickly learn and adopt ADB\u2019s regulations and \nrequirements. Third, PPMOs and CPMOs existing financial management capacity supports strong \nfinancial management and timely project disbursement. Fourth, proven operational mechanisms \nare in place to streamline project management including the annual work planning, monitoring, \nand reporting, thus reducing the time for the project to become effective and ensuring overall \nmanagement during implementation. Finally, established and tested implementation manuals \nexist from the ongoing project that will be used to guide financial management, procurement, and \nproject  progress  as  well  as  safeguard  monitoring  and  reporting.  The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  June 2019\u2013June 2024 \nEstimated completion date   30 June 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2024 \nManagement: \n(i)   Oversight body  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs \n(ii)  Executing agency  National Project Management Office  \nOffice for Comprehensive Agriculture Development, Farmland Construction \nand Management Department, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs  \n(iii)  Key implementing  Provincial Project Management Offices for the provinces of Guizhou, Hubei, \nagencies  Hunan, Sichuan, and Yunnan; and for Chongqing Municipality through \nrespective provincial and/or municipal government \n(iv)  Implementation units  County Project Management Offices of 47 cities and/or counties through \ntheir respective government \nProcurement  National competitive bidding  521 contracts  $316.7 million \nShopping  56 contracts  $3.2 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection,  multiple  $3.1 million \nconsultant qualifications selection,  contracts   \nand/or individual consultant selection  \n                                                \n27 The Office for Comprehensive Agriculture Development, the executing agency for Loan 2943-PRC (footnote 23), \nwas relocated from the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. The office retains the same \nstaff, capacity, and operational mandate for project management and implementation. \n ", "8 \nAspects   Arrangements \nRetroactive financing  Advance contracting and retroactive financing were expected for selected \nand/or advance contracting  civil works and goods. Retroactive financing will be subject to a maximum \namount equivalent to 20% of the loan amount for eligible expenditures \nincurred prior to loan effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 months before \nthe loan agreement is signed. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  The project was prepared in accordance with the PRC\u2019s guidelines and regulations, and \nthe consultants\u2019 recommendations during project preparation were considered. The technical \nfeasibility was confirmed to be adequate after detailed examination of the project\u2019s compatibility \nwith local conditions. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment rated the climate change impact \non the project as medium high because of projected increases in annual mean temperatures and \nprecipitation as well as more intense and frequent extreme weather events (e.g., droughts, severe \nstorms). The project addresses these concerns through the application of water-saving irrigation \nmeasures, better crop varieties, and stronger disease control. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The economic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  17.7%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of \nCNY3,511.3 million. The analysis also confirmed the economic viability of all subprojects, with \neconomic internal rates of return between 12.4% and 22.4%. The sensitivity analysis indicated \nthat the project is robust to the negative scenarios examined, such as an increase in investment \ncosts, a reduction in revenues, and an increase in operation and maintenance costs. The full \neconomic benefits of the project are expected to be significantly higher because some effects \nsuch  as  ecological  benefits  are  not  easily  quantifiable.  The  financial  analysis  included  an \nassessment of the project\u2019s financial sustainability, and of the financial management capacity of \nthe executing and implementing agencies. The financial sustainability assessment covered the \nfiscal impact of counterpart funding for the project and incremental recurrent costs such as \noperation and maintenance expenditures. It confirmed the financial sustainability of the project, \nand the fiscal impacts are well within the government\u2019s projected revenue capacities.28 \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  The financial management risk  before  considering mitigation  measures  is  moderate \nmainly because of a moderate inherent risk, low control risk, and the comparatively high level of \nfinancial management capacities. Measures to mitigate the identified financial management risks \nare in the financial management assessment.29 The procurement risk assessment confirmed that \nthe implementing agencies, which will conduct procurement through a procurement agency and \nwith the assistance of ADB and the consultants, have adequate procurement capacity to comply \n                                                \n28 For all five provinces and one municipality, the counterpart funding commitment and incremental recurrent costs are \nless than 0.01% of projected revenue. \n29 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the NPMO. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  Poverty and social. The project is classified as targeted intervention-geographic (TI-G) \nfor poverty reduction. The project\u2019s support for rural livelihoods will benefit 1.787 million people in \npoor and less developed rural areas\u2014724 villages, 144 townships, and 47 counties\u2014of five \nprovinces and one municipality. Of these 31 counties are national- and/or provincial-level poverty \ncounties, and the poverty ratio in the project area is high.30 The project will significantly contribute \nto poverty reduction by involving many farmers in the development of high-quality farmland, by \nintroducing modern farming and environmental management practices as well as voluntary land \nleasing, and by building human capital. The project will provide 25,078 full-time and 45,883 part-\ntime jobs for local people, including the poor, ethnic minorities, and women. Consultations with \nfarmers and stakeholders took place during project preparation, and resulting measures were \nincluded in the social development action plan. \n27.  Gender. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. It will particularly \nbenefit women, who are the majority workforce in the agriculture sector. In the medium and long \nterm, the newly restored high-quality farmland and modern farming practices will expand women\u2019s \naccess to economic opportunities. The environmental management and training programs will \nincrease their capacity and improve their living environment and quality of life. In the short term, \nthe  project  will  provide  women  with  access  to  construction  and  operation  jobs  during \nimplementation.  It  will  increase  women\u2019s  voice  in  decision  making  through  their  active \nparticipation in the design and implementation of project activities. A gender action plan was \nprepared based on gender analyses and local consultations; and it includes specific targets for \nwomen, including at least (i) 40% participation of women in design and implementation of farming \nand environmental management; (ii) 40% participation of women in training and capacity building \nfor farmers; (iii) 30% of jobs for women in project construction and operation works; (iv) 40% of \njobs for women in the operations of farmer cooperatives; and (v) 30% participation by women in \ntraining provided to each CPMO and/or PPMO. Key gender indicators were included in the design \nand monitoring framework. \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows:31 \n29.  Environment  (category  B).  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B,  and  an  initial \nenvironmental examination and consolidated environmental management plan was prepared by \nthe NPMO and PPMOs in accordance with the requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement \nand was disclosed publicly and posted on the ADB website on 1 October 2018. These documents \nare consistent with and complement the domestic environmental impact assessment report that \n                                                \n30 In 2016, the poverty incidence in the project areas was 21% in Yunnan, 15% in Guizhou, 6% in Sichuan, 5% in \nHunan, and 3% in Hubei provinces, and 4% in Chongqing Municipality. \n31 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n \n ", "10 \nmeets the requirements of the PRC\u2019s Environmental Impact Assessment Law (2016) and relevant \nregulations.32  \n30.  The environmental assessment confirmed that the project is expected to generate multiple \nand significant environmental benefits, such as (i) a decrease in the application rate and total \nquantity of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and contribution to the control of NPS pollution in \nthe project region; (ii) less soil erosion and better soil quality; (iii) recycling of agricultural waste \nand its reuse as fertilizer resource, and promotion of green agricultural development; (iv) better \nwater use efficiency; and (v) stronger climate resilience. These will contribute to the improvement \nof the Yangtze River\u2019s ecological and environmental quality, and the development of sustainable \nagriculture. Major adverse impacts were not identified. Some counties may increase their overall \nwater use, but they are all located in areas where water resources are more abundant. Potential \nerosion risks can be mitigated adequately. The impacts on water quality or eutrophication are \nconsidered negligible because the use of agrochemicals per hectare will be reduced. Project \nactivities will not be carried out in environmentally sensitive areas. It is expected that all impacts \nwill  be  prevented  or  minimized  to  an  acceptable  level  by  implementing  the  environmental \nmanagement plan and monitoring program. \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will not involve involuntary land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. Of an estimated total 1,400,622 mu of land area under the \nproject construction activities, 1,348,905 mu is managed and operated by the beneficiary farmers, \nwhere agricultural activities will be undertaken that do not involve any land use rights transfer \n(LURT).33 The construction of farming facilities will take place on existing rights of way or on \nunutilized land (5,379 mu) donated by beneficiary villages. The plantation activities will be \nundertaken mostly on unutilized slopes (45,938 mu) leased by cooperatives. In addition, existing \nstate-owned land (400 mu) will be used for bridge and embankment upgrades. A due diligence \nreview of the LURT and donation agreements confirmed that these are voluntary and based on \nconsultations and provide fair benefits to farmers. In addition, a LURT framework was prepared \nfor future transfers that may be needed during project implementation. Consultations were held \nduring project preparation with local people, village committees, and farmer cooperatives, who \nwill be further consulted during project implementation. Specific grievance redress mechanisms \nwere set up and incorporated into the LURT framework. The project will engage an external \nmonitoring agency to verify or monitor the LURT agreements, and semiannual social monitoring \nreports will be submitted to ADB during project implementation. \n32.  Indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities (category B). The project area in Guizhou \nProvince has 44.19% beneficiaries belonging to ethnic minorities and 27 ethnic minority villages. \nThe project area in Yunnan Province has 4.6% beneficiaries belonging to ethnic minorities and \nfour ethnic minority villages. Project areas in other provinces either do not have or have only very \nsmall percentages of scattered ethnic minority populations. The ethnic minority communities, \nparticularly in Guizhou and Yunnan provinces, are expected to benefit from the project through \nemployment opportunities, modern agriculture, better environmental management, and capacity \nbuilding. The ecological protection activities are not expected to involve impacts of involuntary \ndisplacement or restrictions for ethnic minorities. An ethnic minority development plan was \nprepared in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including ethnic minority communities. The \nplan will promote ethnic minority communities\u2019 participation in and benefits from project activities, \n                                                \n32 Government of the PRC, People\u2019s Congress. 2003.

The plan was disclosed publicly and \nposted on the ADB website on 6 December 2017. \n33.  Capacity for social measures. The NPMO has experience in implementing an ADB \nproject, but most PPMOs and CPMOs do not. To implement the social measures properly (i) the \nNPMO, the PPMOs, and the CPMOs will each appoint focal social staff; (ii) focal social staff will \nbe provided with training in social measures; (iii) consultants will be recruited to assist in the \nimplementation and internal monitoring of social measures; and (iv) an independent monitoring \nagency will be recruited for external monitoring. \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n34.  The risk assessment of the overall project is medium, and the benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. The risks, which were rated either low or moderate, and the \nmitigation measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n35.  The government and the NPMO have assured ADB that the implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and the NPMO have agreed with ADB on \ncertain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \nAdditionally, no withdrawal from the ADB loan account will be made for any civil works until \nconfirmation is obtained from the government in a manner satisfactory to ADB that the relevant \nbeneficiaries have committed to providing their in-kind contributions. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Yangtze River Green Ecological Corridor \nComprehensive Agriculture Development Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in \nregular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n17 October 2018\n                                                \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nEnvironmental protection, rehabilitation, and management of the Yangtze River improved (Yangtze River Economic \nBelt Development Plan, 2016\u20132030)a \n \nPerformance Indicators \nwith  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting   Risks \nOutcome  By mid of 2025 within the    A reduction in prices for \nSustainability and  project counties:    agricultural chemicals \nmodernity of agricultural  a. 115,000 ha of farmland  a.
