INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country programming mission in December 2010, the Government of the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide \ncapacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)1 to  help  the  Datang  International  Power \nGeneration Company (Datang Power)2 study, pilot test, and analyze the use of carbon dioxide \ncapture and storage (CCS) to reduce carbon dioxide (CO ) emission from natural gas-based \n2\ncombined cycle (NGCC) power plants.3 The TA was included in ADB's country operations \nbusiness plan, 2011\u20132013 for the PRC.4 The concept paper was approved on 19 August 2011. \nDuring the fact-finding mission, an understanding was reached with the Ministry of Finance and \nDatang  Power  and  was  recorded  in  a  memorandum  of  understanding.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC is now widely recognized as the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions in the world.5 About half of the PRC\u2019s CO  emissions come from the generation of \n2\nelectricity and heat and 25% are produced by industry. These two sources also contribute to \nmore localized air pollution problems due to their heavy reliance on energy from coal. Although \nthe government has taken measures to address these issues, growing demand for electricity \nand heat in urban areas has made reducing the growth of GHGs and other pollutants from the \ncountry\u2019s power sector a major challenge.  \n \n3.  During the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015), the PRC plans to increase its installed \npower generation capacity by about 530 gigawatts (GW) through a diversified energy mix of 295 \nGW  from  thermal  power  (including  16  GW  from  natural  gas-fired  power),  120  GW  from \nhydropower, 70 GW from wind power, 40 GW from nuclear power, and 5 GW from solar power. \nApart from targeting large increases in renewable energy and carbon free nuclear energy, the \nplan emphasizes greater use of low carbon natural gas in energy mix by increasing its share \nfrom less than 4% of overall capacity in 2010 to over 8% by 2015.6 The government also plans \nto close a large number of old and inefficient coal-based power plants and heat-only boilers and \nto maximize the use of combined heat and power (CHP) plants. CHP and combine cycle power \nplants using natural gas are becoming increasingly attractive options for meeting stringent air \nquality and emission requirements in northern urban areas of the PRC, such as Beijing and \nTianjin.7  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 07 October 2011. \n2  The Datang International Power Generation Company is a state-owned enterprise. With more than 37 GW of \ninstalled capacity, it is one of the largest independent power producers in the PRC. It is a core subsidiary of China \nDatang Corporation, which is one of only two power generating companies in the PRC with more than 100 GW of \ninstalled power generation capacity. \n3  CO  capture and storage, more commonly known as CCS, refers to a suite of technologies that separates CO\n2 2 \nfrom emission sources\u2014such as fossil fuel power plants and industrial facilities\u2014transports it to a suitable storage \nsite, and injects it deep in underground formations for storage. \n4  ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132013. Manila. \n5  Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are often called GHG. Scientific studies have shown that these gases are \nresponsible for global climate change. CO  is the main GHG. \n2\n6  Natural gas is only half as carbon intensive as coal. A natural gas power plant will typically emit half of the CO and \n2 \nonly a fraction of the sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide that a coal-based plant of equivalent capacity will. The \nnatural gas consumption has been steadily rising in the PRC. In 2010, it consumed more than 100 billion cubic \nmeters of natural gas. \n7  The ambient air quality standards in the PRC are not as stringent as the World Health Organization suggested \ninterim targets. Revised and tighter standards are expected to be in place during the 12th Five-Year Plan. \n ", "2  \n \n4.  Datang Power is planning to develop a 1,050 megawatt NGCC plant at Gaojing near \nBeijing to meet the growing electricity and heating demand in and around the city. The proposed \nNGCC plant is expected to replace a 600 megawatt coal-fired power plant that has operated for \n40 years. The new plant is to be built on the same site and will produce less emission than the \nold  plant  it  replaces  despite  its  greater  output.8 It  will  also  have  very  high  efficiency  of \ncogeneration power units of 87%. Nonetheless, it will still emit a large amount of CO  and have \n2\na deleterious impact on global climate change.  \n \n5.  CCS technologies are now widely recognized as the most promising and the only nearly \ncommercially viable technology available to disassociate CO emissions from fossil fuel usage \n2 \nat scale. CCS has been used successfully in oil and gas industries for decades and aggressive \ninternational efforts are underway to demonstrate CCS in coal and natural gas-based power \nplants.  CCS  is  included  in  all  cost  effective  climate  change  mitigation  strategies  of  the \nInternational Energy Agency (IEA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The \nIEA estimates that CCS can contribute 19% of the emission reduction needed to constrain a rise \nin global temperature to within the agreed limit of 2 degrees celsius. According to the IEA, the \ncost of achieving the same emission reduction without CCS would be 70% higher.   \n \n6.  A CCS road map developed by the IEA calls for more than 100 CCS projects to be in \noperation by 2020, half of them in developing countries. More than 70 fully integrated CCS \nprojects have reached various stages of development across the world but the overwhelming \nmajority  of  them  are  in  developed  countries.  Demonstrating  CCS  in  developing  countries \ndependent  on  fossil  fuels  is  now  viewed  by  all  stakeholders  as  essential  to  making  its \ndeployment  likely  and  to  decarbonizing  their  power  sectors.  At  the  16th  session  of  the \nConference of the Parties in Cancun 2010 under the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate  Change,  CCS  was  considered  eligible  as  a  project  activity  under  the  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism but several issues related to its implementation remained outstanding. \nThey are expected to be resolved by end 2011 at the 17th Conference of the Parties meeting in \nDurban, South Africa.  \n \n7.  Currently, the PRC does not include CCS in the portfolio of low-carbon technologies that \nit is aggressively pursuing.9  This is because CCS has not been demonstrated commercially in \nmany fossil fuel power plants in the PRC or elsewhere.10 Moreover, CCS substantially increases \nthe capital cost of a power plant and reduces electricity output and plant efficiency because \nadditional fuel and electricity are needed to capture and store CO .11 But the PRC is adding a \n2\nlarge amount of new fossil fuel-based power plant capacity every year\u2014along with the large \nnew volumes of CO  emissions these plants produce. The country added 58 GW to its thermal \n2\npower capacity in 2010 alone. This is a compelling reason to fast-track the demonstration of \nCCS on fossil fuel power plants in the PRC as a least-cost option for CO  abatement.   \n2\n                                                 \n8  The estimated annual emission reductions are 1,350 tons of sulfur dioxide, 2,200 tons of nitrogen oxide, and          \n2 million tons of CO . \n2\n9  In the PRC, low-carbon energy development is primarily aimed at improving energy intensity\u2014reducing the amount \nof energy used per unit of gross domestic product\u2014and scaling up renewable energy production. \n10 At the moment, only five large fully integrated operational CCS projects mainly in oil and gas exploration/ \nprocessing \u2013 Sleipner and Snohvit (both in Norway); In Salah (Algeria); Rangely (USA); and Weyburn \u2013 Midale \n(USA/Canada). But many such plants are either in construction or in advanced planning stage The Global Status of \nCCS: 2011 report by the Global CCS Institute suggests that of 74 large-scale CCS projects that are in various \nstages of development, 42 are in fossil fuel power plants. \n11 An ADB commissioned study in the PRC found that fitting CCS on coal-fired power plants, increases capital cost by \n25%\u201365%.  \n ", "  3\n \n8.  Due to large new fossil fuel-based power plants capacity addition every year, the use of \n\u201cCCS ready\u201d as a planning condition also assumes greater significance in the PRC before CCS \ntechnologies have been demonstrated commercially.12 In future, when restrictions on carbon \nemissions  are  likely  to  be  imposed  and  enforced,  plants  without  CCS-ready  option  may \nexperience carbon \u201clock-in\u201d and become stranded assets.13 Including CCS readiness in the \nplanning and construction of a plant at what is now a marginally incremental cost roughly \nestimated at 1%\u20132% of the total capital investment will allow, encourage, and assist a smooth \nCCS retrofit in the future and avoid carbon lock-in. \n \n9.  To best illustrate CCS potential, it is essential that CCS-ready projects are developed \nthrough a major power-generating company such as Datang Power, which is already planning \nmany natural gas-based power plants during the twelfth plan. The TA will help Datang Power \ntest and demonstrate the CCS-ready approach in planning and construction of the proposed \nNGCC plant near Beijing (para. 4). The TA will also look at measures to further improve the air \npollution performance of this plant against international best practices. Reducing air pollution \ncan cut the incidence of respiratory infections, heart disease, and lung cancer by around 15%.14 \nAny reduction in emissions from power and heat generation provides indirect benefits to all \nresidents in a project area, including the poor, who are more vulnerable to such diseases due to \ntheir greater exposure to outdoor air pollution.  \n \n10.  ADB recognizes the importance of CCS to environmentally sustainable growth in the \nfossil fuel-based economies of its developing member countries and plays an active part in \ninternational CCS activities. It is a stakeholder in the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum \nand a member of the Global CCS Institute. It has also set up a dedicated CCS fund under its \nClean Energy Financing Partnership Facility with a contribution of A$21.5 million equivalent by \nthe Global CCS Institute. The capacity development TA will complement other ongoing ADB TA \nprojects and a loan for the PRC\u2019s first integrated gasification combined cycle power plant at \nTianjin.15  The TA will extend previous ADB interventions of CO  capture from coal-based plants \n2\nto CO  capture from natural gas plants.16 \n2\n \n11.  The TA is consistent with (i) the strategic priority of environmentally sustainable growth \nunder ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020; (ii) ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (2011\u20132015) for the PRC, \n                                                 \n12 A CCS-ready power plant is one that is not initially fitted for CO  capture but has sufficient space and is near \n2\nenough to possible CO  storage sites to allow the installation of CO capture when regulatory or economic drivers \n2 2 \nare in place. Specific criteria and essential requirements for CCS-ready plants were already developed by both IEA \nand the Global CCS Institute. \n13 Carbon \u201clock-in\u201d refers to a situation where plants will continue to emit large amount of CO  as CCS is not feasible \n2\nto retrofit. Stranded asset are those that have become obsolete in advance of complete depreciation \n14 World Health Organization. 2006.

Precombustion technology is generally applicable in coal-\n2\nbased plants; CO  is separated before combustion, such as in integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) \n2\nplants. Post-combustion technology is applicable to both coal and natural gas plants; CO  is separated from \n2\ncombustion exhaust gases. In oxy-combustion technology, coal is burned in oxygen instead of air to produce a high \nconcentration CO  stream.      \n2\n ", "4  \ncurrently being prepared, which identifies environmental sustainability as a strategic pillar, and \n(iii) its Energy Policy, which prioritizes energy efficiency and environmental protection. 17   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the TA will be the staged application of CCS in natural gas-based power \nplants using a CCS-ready approach. The outcome of the TA will be an enhanced capacity of \nDatang Power and key stakeholders in planning, management, and implementation of natural \ngas-based CCS-ready plants. By establishing conditions necessary to make CCS-ready plants, \nthe TA may lead to policy and regulatory measures that can be adopted to prompt the design, \npermitting and construction of CCS projects in the PRC.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will (i) develop a CCS road map for natural gas-based CHP plants; (ii) compare, \npilot-test at Gaojing power plant, and select more efficient and cost-effective technology for the \nCO   capture  from  natural  gas-based  CHP  plants;  (iii)  develop  CCS  readiness  criteria  and \n2\nidentify priority demonstration projects and associated financing needs; (iv) assess and develop \ncomprehensive  capacity  for  CCS-ready  and  retrofit  projects;  and  (v)  implement  a  public \noutreach  program.  The  detailed  activities  are  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework   \n(Appendix 1). The TA design has been kept as modular to address some key activities such as \npilot project implementation and storage site assessment as discussed below.  \n \n14.  The CCS road map development for natural gas-based plants in the PRC requires wider \nstakeholder consultation and participation. The TA has been designed and will be implemented \nin close coordination with key stakeholders, which include the Department of Climate Change in \nthe National Development and Reform Commission, the Chinese Academy of Science, relevant \nresearch institutes, the Global CCS Institute, and other well-known international and national \nknowledge centers. The CO  capture from the natural gas-based power plant is a cost intensive \n2\nand high risk component of the whole CCS chain. Selection of appropriate technology is a key \nto manage the cost and technology risks. The TA includes preparation of simulation desk \nstudies to compare technologies and pilot testing of the preferred CO  capture technology by \n2\ncapturing about 1,500 tons of CO  per year for industrial utilization. Similarly, CO  storage \n2 2\nassessment is critical to establish the CCS readiness of any plant. The storage assessment is \nincluded as a standalone activity in the TA design. This will allow high-level assessment of CO  \n2\nstorage potential near the Gaojing power plant. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The estimated cost of the TA is the equivalent to $3.15 million. It is proposed that ADB \nprovide the equivalent of $1.8 million on a grant basis from the Carbon Capture and Storage \nFund18 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, to be administered by ADB. The \ngovernment will finance the equivalent to $1.35 million for the pilot project and provide office \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2008.

The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  Datang Power will be the executing agency and implementing agency. Counterpart staff, \noffice accommodation and facilities, and transport for site visits, as required, will be provided by \nDatang Power.19 \n \n17.  The TA will require a total of 10 person-months of international consulting services and \n49 person-months of national consulting services. The indicative terms of reference and the \ntype of expertise for the team of consultants are in Appendix 3. ADB, in consultation with the \nexecuting agency, will select and engage international and national consultants in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) using \nthe 80%\u201320% weighted quality- and cost-based selection method. The consulting firm will be \nrequired to submit a simplified technical proposal covering all aspects of the terms of reference. \nEquipment purchased under the TA will be turned over to Datang Power after completion of the \nTA. Any procurement of goods and services during the TA implementation using TA resources \nwill be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n18.  With inputs from the consultants, Datang Power will finalize the scope and content of the \ntraining and information dissemination programs during the TA implementation and submit to \nADB for prior approval. An advance payment facility will be provided under the TA. Workshops, \nseminars, and conferences will be organized for stakeholder consultations and to discuss TA \noutputs  progressively  during  the  TA  implementation.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be \nconducted in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time).  \n \n19.  The modular approach of the TA design (paras. 14 and 15) will ensure that the TA can \nadequately address the key technical tasks and associated risks by engaging relevant experts \nduring the TA implementation on as need basis. Moreover, wider stakeholder participation from \nan early stage of the TA implementation will facilitate broader dissemination of TA outputs. To \nfurther  strengthen  the  knowledge  dissemination,  targeted  activities  are  planned  through \ndevelopment of knowledge products and services including setting up a website.  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from 15 February 2012 to 15 August 2013. \nThe  consultants  will  be  required  to  submit  TA  deliverables  and  progress  reports  on  time. \nDetailed requirements for deliverables and reports are included in the outline terms of reference \nfor consultants. A consultation workshop will be held on the draft final report covering all aspects \nof the TA (Appendix 3). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n21.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,800,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Carbon Capture and Storage Fund under the Clean Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility for the Study on Carbon Capture and Storage in Natural Gas-\nBased Power Plants.  \n                                                 \n19 The memorandum of understanding (para.1) records Datang Power\u2019s commitment for these facilities and services.   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines Reporting Mechanisms Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n \nStaged application of  Multiple CCS demonstration  Implementation of priority  The government and \nCCS in natural gas- and CCS-ready plants are  CCS-ready plant(s)  enterprises maintain \nbased power plants  launched after 2015  included in 12th  Five-Year  strong interest in CCS and \nusing a CCS ready    Plan  make required \napproach   A comprehensive CCS    investments. \ndevelopment plan and CCS- Reports of IEA, Global   \nready regulation becomes  CCS Institute and CSLF  The government provides \npart of the government\u2019s plan  incentives and adopts \nby 2015  appropriate regulatory \n  requirements. \nCCS becomes part of the   \nprogram for GHG emission  Enabling international \ncontrol in PRC after 2015  financing and technology \n  transfer mechanisms \nevolve in due time. \n \nRisks \nThe road map is \nimplemented slowly.  \n \nCCS technologies do not \ndevelop sufficiently within \nthis time frame.  \nOutcome      Assumption \n \nEnhanced capacity of  The government considers  Consultants\u2019 reports  The road map is accepted \nDatang Power and key  the road map, with inputs  and implemented by the \n \nstakeholders in   from other ongoing related  government agencies. \nplanning, management,  activities, by 2012  Report of NEA and   \nand implementation of    Department of Climate  Risks \nnatural gas-based CCS- CCS-ready standards are  Change, National  The additional investments \nready plants  developed in the PRC and a  Development and Reform  for and risks of CCS-ready \nfeasibility assessment for  Commission  application are considered \npriority CCS-ready project is    too high by developers \ncompleted under the TA by  and the government. \n \nearly 2013   \n  The geological data for a \nA knowledge product  storage site is not \ndescribing key requirements  available or a suitable \nof CCS readiness developed  storage site cannot be \nand disseminate to all major  identified for priority \npower companies and key  project. \nstakeholders by 2013 \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
