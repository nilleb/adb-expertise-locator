INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will provide evidence-based policy \nadvice for enhancing  the skills development system for young farmers as part of the rural \nrevitalization of Gansu Province in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). It will (i) assess the \nrelevance and quality of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and short-term \nskills development programs, and (ii) promote a needs-based and entrepreneurship-driven skills \ndevelopment system for the new generation farmers to contribute to reducing poverty and \ninequality in rural areas.  \n \n2.  The TA is included in the list of projects agreed between the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the PRC Government on 22 January 2020.1 The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 Operational Plan for (i) Priority 1: Addressing Remaining Poverty and Reducing Inequalities, \n(ii)  Priority  2:  Accelerating  Progress  in  Gender  Equality,  (iii)  Priority  5:  Promoting  Rural \nDevelopment and Food Security, and (iv) Priority 6: Strengthening Governance and Institutional \nCapacity.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Gansu Provincial Government is committed to the PRC\u2019s rural revitalization strategy \nfor 2018\u20132022 as it aims to reinvigorate rural areas across the country to reduce poverty, promote \nequity, improve rural development, and support green and inclusive growth.3 To achieve these \nobjectives, the PRC is institutionalizing the development of a new type of professional farmers4 \nthrough human capital development, policy support, and social security. Over the last 30 years, \nthe agricultural labor force has decreased by more than 290 million as they have left farms to \nwork in cities and towns.5 This migration has resulted in an aging farming population6 in the PRC. \n \n4.  In general, female farmers are less educated and have less access to training. Therefore, \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises led by women are more likely to experience skills constraints \nin developing and selling high-quality products. To improve the productivity and efficiency of their \nbusinesses and/or farms, women need better access to capacity building and digital technologies \nand communication platforms for marketing. \n \n5.  The  National  Plan  on  the  Development  of  New-Type  Professional  Farmers  for  the \nthirteenth five-year plan issued in 2017 outlines the overarching goals, methods, and major \n \n1  The original TA title, Cultivating New Generation Farmers for Consolidating and Improving the Achievements of \nPoverty Alleviation in the Rural Revitalization Strategy of Gansu Province, was adjusted to better reflect the scope. \nThe TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 September 2020. \n2  ADB. 2019.

Beijing.   \n4  New generation farmers refer to those who were born after 1980 and are engaged or will be engaged in agricultural \nproduction and management. These are agricultural professionals and part-time farmers, college students who intend \nto work in agriculture, and rural returning migrant workers. \n5  Government of the PRC, National Statistics Bureau. 2020. Migrant Workers Monitoring Survey Report of 2019. \nBeijing. \n6  Based on official observations of more than 20,000 rural families, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs \n(formerly Ministry of Agriculture) concluded that the average age of the PRC's frontline agricultural labor force is \nabout 53, with those above 60 accounting for more than 25%. \n ", " \n2 \nprojects for the education of such new professional farmers.7 The objective of this education is to \nprepare the young generation of professional farmers to (i) use modern technology; (ii) accelerate \nthe transformation of agricultural scientific and technological achievements; and (iii) play a role \nas a bridge in promoting the integration of production, education, and research. However, the \nfarmers\u2019 professional qualification process is hindered by (i) inadequate and poor quality TVET in \nrural areas, as well as the need for entrepreneurship-driven skills development programs to \naddress low agricultural productivity; (ii) limited and/or outdated production skills because of weak \nindustry\u2013TVET  cooperation  and  poor  management,  and  insufficient  marketing  skills  to  be \ncompetitive and innovative; (iii) limited access to information resources, e-commerce, and digital \nplatforms; and (iv) lack of well-established and coordinated public services platform for farmers \nand returning migrants, including provision of capacity and financial support for entrepreneurship.  \n \n6.  Located in northwest PRC, Gansu is the seventh-largest province in the PRC with a \npopulation of 26.47 million as of 2019. Despite recent economic growth, it is still one of the least-\ndeveloped provinces in the country in terms of income and human development. In 2019, Gansu \nProvince\u2019s total gross domestic product was CNY871 billion, of which agriculture accounted for \n12.05%. Gansu\u2019s gross domestic product per capita of CNY32,995 in 2019 was the lowest of all \nprovinces in the PRC; 50% of Gansu\u2019s 86 counties were designated as national poverty counties.8 \nWith 51.5% (13.63 million) of its population living in rural areas, it is also the least-urbanized \nprovince in the PRC.9 Although agriculture remains an important source of rural livelihoods, the \nopportunities for income generation remain limited because of low productivity and the lack of \nhigh-quality, well-trained professional farmers.  \n \n7.  In  2017,  the  Gansu  Provincial  Government  issued  a  five-year  action  plan  on \nentrepreneurship training for returning migrants, new generation farmers, and rural youth.10 In \n2019, the Gansu Provincial Department of Education started implementing a new plan to improve \nthe new generation migrant workers\u2019 vocational skills in order to promote the identification of rural \ntalents.11 In January 2020, the Gansu Provincial Government proposed to improve the education \nand training system for agricultural talents and develop skills training for the new generation of \nprofessional farmers.12 Despite comprehensive policies and plans, coordination among different \nplayers and the relevance and quality of the training remain inadequate. \n \nIII.
