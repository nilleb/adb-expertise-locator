The ensuing project will contribute to achieving targets defined in the National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan that is derived from the government\u2019s rectangular strategy.1 The strategy aims \nto develop and expand the country\u2019s irrigated land and manage its water resources more \neffectively by improving existing irrigation systems, making water user communities more efficient, \nbuilding capacity of the water users, and reducing the vulnerability of the Cambodia\u2019s people to \nclimate induced disasters. The Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Project will also incorporate \nfindings and recommendations of Asian Development Bank (ADB) sector strategy including \n(i) enhancing  agriculture  productivity,  (ii)  promoting  diversification,  (iii)  environmental \nsustainability and climate change, (iv) gender development, and (v) addressing institutional \nconstraints. The project is consistent with two of the major strategic thrusts and components of \nthe Country Partnership Strategy, 2014-2018 i.e. agriculture and physical infrastructure.2 It also \nconforms to ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan and Irrigation Subsector Guidance Note 2017 that \nfocus on increasing irrigation efficiency3 and water productivity;4 and Agriculture and Natural \nResources Operational Plan that focuses on increasing agricultural productivity and improved \nmanagement of natural resources.  \n \n2.  ADB has pioneered approaches to mainstream irrigation efficiency and water productivity \nmanagement  options  in  the  project  design,  and  introduced  a  new  model  for  sustainable \nmanagement of irrigation systems by integrating modernization, upgrading and climate proofing \nunder  Uplands Irrigation  and Water  Resources  Management  Sector Project,5 that  is  being \nimplemented successfully. It is worth mentioning that no other project in Cambodia financed by \nany donor has introduced such approaches. Building upon those approaches, the project will \ndeliver the following two outputs to address the key issues and constraints in sustainable \nmanagement of irrigation and water resources. \n \n3.  Output 1: Efficiency and climate resilience of irrigation systems enhanced.  The \nproject will upgrade, modernize and climate proof irrigation infrastructure and their management \nincluding reservoirs and canals in at least five irrigation systems ensuring dry season irrigation \nsupplies  for  about  40,000  ha  agricultural  land.  The  project  will  finance  remodeling  and \nimprovement of main, secondary and tertiary canals as well as appurtenant structures designed \nto supply water as per seasonal crop water requirements. Cropping patterns will be designed for \neach canal command area to estimate the crop water requirements that will ascertain the design \ncapacity of canals and maximize cropping intensities. For crop diversification, demand analysis \nwill be done to determine cropping pattern in each canal command based on the market response \nand other relevant factors. Land drainage and flood management facilities will be provided, where \n                                                \n1  Government of Cambodia. 2013. Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency, Phase III. \nPhnom Penh. The document presents the 5-year policy agenda of the government and forms the basis of the National \nStrategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018. \n2  ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Cambodia, 2014-2018. Manila. \n3  There is no evidence of measuring irrigation efficiency and data on that in Cambodia. ADB, for the first time, measured \nirrigation efficiency in three canal systems during preparation of the Uplands Irrigation and Water Resources \nManagement Sector Project in 2015. A baseline of 20% was established on that basis. Same approach will be \nadopted to establish baseline for the selected irrigation systems during project preparation. \n4  There is no data available on water productivity in Cambodia. ADB developed an approach to estimate that during \npreparation of Uplands Irrigation and Water Resources Project in 2015 and estimated water productivity of rice, \ncassava, corn, water melon, pineapple and mung bean in three canal commands. Results showed that rice and \ncassava have the lowest water productivity, $0.1 and $0.08 respectively; water melon has highest $0.35; and mung \nbean, corn and pineapple corn have $0.19, $0.18 and $0.17 per cubic meter of water respectively. The project will \nadopt same approach for establishing baseline and targets for the selected irrigation systems. \n5 ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors; Proposed Loan to the \nGovernment of Cambodia for Uplands Irrigation and Water Resources Management Sector Project. Manila. \n \n ", "2         \nrequired. Irrigation systems will be designed to double the existing irrigation efficiency.6 At least \nfive farmer water user communities (FWUCs) will be established/operationalized and trained to \nassume responsibility of operation and maintenance (O&M) of the distribution canals. An irrigation \nasset management system will be established to help improve O&M budgeting and management \nof irrigation assets in the country. That will be based on the Cambodia Irrigation Schemes \nInformation System, which provides basic data on the canal condition, service area, beneficiaries \netc. For main canals, O&M plans will be prepared for each canal during design. The project will \nmodernize canal operations, undertake irrigation scheduling, and integrate the scheduling with \nthe canal flow management system to manage supplies, particularly during droughts. It will also \ndesign  joint  reservoir  operations  for  improving  water-sharing  arrangements  between  linked \nsystems and ensure equitable distribution, particularly during droughts.  \n \n4.  Output 2: Water resource management improved. The project will provide gender-\ninclusive training to FWUC members on (i) O&M of canals; (ii) governance and management of \nFWUCs; (iii) crop diversification; and (iv) water management. FWUCs will also be involved in \nimplementation of the subprojects. Water flow gauges will be installed in canals to establish canal \nflow management system. Hydro-meteorological stations will be installed in the watersheds to \ncollect real-time river flow and climatic data. The project will train staff of the relevant government \ndepartments and FWUCs on (i) modern canal operation techniques; (ii) irrigation scheduling; \n(iii) water management; and (iv) O&M. A water management information system (WMIS) will be \ndeveloped as a common platform for country-wide data of river flows and rainfall. That will also \nincorporate data generated by water accounting through remote sensing. WMIS will be housed in \nnational water data management center (NWDMC) that will be established by the project. \nNWDMC will be the hub for water related information/data in the country and shall be responsible \nfor collecting, analyzing and disseminating information/data. \n \n5.  The above outputs will result in the following outcome: water and agricultural productivity \nenhanced. The impact will be inclusive economic growth through agriculture and irrigation aligned \nwith  National Strategic Development Plan and Rectangular Strategy on Growth, Employment, \nEquity and Efficiency, Phase III, 2014 to 2018. \n  \n6.  The project area, expected to be three to four provinces, will be selected out of seven \nprovinces including Battambang, Kampot, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, Prey Veng, Takeo, \nand Tbong Khmum by the transaction technical assistance (TRTA) consultants on the basis of a \nselection criteria. These provinces have great potential to increase agriculture production by 2 to \n3 times as well as crop diversification towards enhanced food security of the country.7 This will \nalso  allow  complementing  the  impact  and  outcome  of  the  Climate  Resilient  Rice \nCommercialization Development Program (Rice-SDP)8 approved in 2013, and the proposed \nClimate-Friendly Agribusiness Value Chains Sector Project scheduled for approval in 2018, that \nare covering these seven provinces. The project will ensure convergence so agriculture value \nchain facilities provided under those two projects will enhance economic value of the increased \nagricultural production brought by the project, resulting in higher incomes of the farmers, reduction \nin imports of fruits and vegetables, and greater economic returns to the country. \n \n7.  The project cost is tentatively estimated at $82.0 million with ADB COL of $75.0 million \n                                                \n6  Irrigation efficiency is the ratio of water consumed by crops to water diverted into a canal system. \n7  Wet season rice is the main crop due to unavailability of water in dry season. The ensuing project will provide water \nin dry season making it possible to grow two additional crops: (i) mix of dry season rice and fruits/vegetables, and \n(ii) only fruits/vegetables such as water melon, pineapple, mung bean etc. \n8  ADB. 2013.

A feasibility study \nreport will be prepared. The international and national experts will be recruited under the TRTA \nto carry out the feasibility study. Feasibility study report will be submitted by the TRTA consultants \nto ADB and the government as part of the technical assistance report.  \n  \n10.  Output 2: Design of ensuing project prepared. The TRTA will (i) determine scope, \ncomponents, and geographical coverage of the project; (ii) identify and prepare subprojects; \n(iii) prepare procurement plan; prepare resettlement plans of subprojects; (iv) conduct initial \nenvironmental examination studies of subprojects and prepare initial environmental examination \nreports; (v) prepare gender action plan; (vi) design implementation arrangements; (vii) develop \nframework  and  recommendations  for  establishing  irrigation  asset  management  system; \n(viii) develop framework and guidelines for developing water management information system \nand  establishing  NWDMC;  (ix)  prepare  terms  of  reference  for  project  management  and \nimplementation support consultants; and, (x) prepare cost estimates and financing plan. This \nTRTA will consult with ongoing TRTA for preparing Water Efficiency Improvement Project in \nDrought Affected Provinces Project in Vietnam to explore possibilities of replicating drought \nmodeling  in  the  project.  A  draft  will  be  submitted  for  ADB  and  government  review  and \nsubsequently that will be finalized based on the comments from ADB and the government.  \n \n11.  Output 3: Detailed engineering design and bidding documents prepared. The TRTA \nconsultants\u2019 team will comprise design engineers who will do detailed engineering design and \nprepare bidding documents of the subprojects. The topographic surveys will be carried out for \ndesign purpose. Detailed engineering designs reports, drawings, and bill of quantities of each \nsubproject will be prepared and submitted to ADB and the government. The detailed engineering \ndesign activities will be financed exclusively by the Project Readiness Improvement Trust Fund \n(PRITF). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,750,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-VI), $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the PRITF9, and administered by ADB.
