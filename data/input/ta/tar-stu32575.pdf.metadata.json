INTRODUCTION\n1. The  regional  technical  assistance1  (TA)  will  examine  modalities  under  which\nCommunications, Navigation, and Surveillance Air Traffic Management2 (CNS/ATM) can be\ninstalled in an amalgamated regional airspace in the Pacific region. The TA is expected to lead\nto an effective cooperative regional management of airspace. The participating Governments3\naim to implement the satellite-based CNS/ATM under conditions of an amalgamated airspace in\nthe Pacific region, and the TA will prepare a strategic action plan guiding this implementation\nprocess, with attention to participatory consultation and economic efficiency.\n2. The Asian Development Bank's (ADB) TA for Pacific airport facilities in December 19944\nexamined the provision, harmonization, and rationalization of air traffic services in the Pacific\nregion, and determined the requirements for introduction of CNS/ATM. It identified substantial\neconomic benefits in regional cooperation through the installation of CNS/ATM and regional\nmanagement  of  airspace.  Since  then  various  aviation  partners  of  the  Pacific  developing\nmember countries (PDMCs) have prepared documentation on the subject. The result, however,\nis  fragmented  understanding  of  the  financial,  economic,  institutional,  legal,  and  social\nimplications  of  the  proposal.  PDMCs  have  collectively,  through  the  South  Pacific  Forum,\nrequested that ADB assume a lead role in developing a feasible strategy for the Pacific region\nto  meet  the  global  requirements  in  the  aviation  sector.  ADB\u2019s  comparative  advantages  in\nundertaking the role are its neutral and multilateral nature, long-term development perspective,\nand continuing support to the PDMCs.\n3. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United\nNations, is concerned with implementing the new CNS/ATM in the region and worldwide. It is\nresponsible  for  global  standards  and  recommended  practices  and  develops  regional  air\nnavigation plans. ICAO\u2019s experience in establishing unified airspace management is recognized\nand has led to successful examples in the Caribbean (COCESNA) and Africa (ASECNA and\nSARATA). This report was prepared in collaboration with ICAO and based on consultations with\nPDMCs governments and service providers. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n4. The current efficiency of air traffic control (ATC) services is dependent on air-ground\ncommunications  and  surveillance.  These  radar  and  very  high  frequency  (VHF)  radio\ncommunications work on line-of-sight basis. Over long distances, and particularly in oceanic\n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in July 2000.\n2\nThe air navigation infrastructure comprises a collection of radio-based terrestrial facilities such as very high\nfrequency omnidirectional radio (VOR), instrument landing systems (ILS, distance measuring equipment (DME),\nnon-directional beacons, and surveillance radar. These systems have been used for more than 45 years. They are\nexpensive to procure and maintain, and are increasingly unable to cope with the growing volume of air traffic\naround the world. In 1984, ICAO established a committee on Future Air Navigation Systems (FANS) to study the\ndevelopment of a more cost-effective system of satellite-based air navigation technology to replace the traditional\nground-based systems. The Communications Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) System\nemerged from the recommendations of the FANS committee. CNS/ATM system promises considerable savings for\ngovernments in reduced investment and maintenance of ground-based aids and for users of the system through\nmore direct air routes and consequently reduced flight times and costs. Implementation of CNS/ATM system by\nsome countries commenced in 1994. The system will be implemented progressively worldwide by the year 2010.\n3 Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and\nVanuatu.\n4 TA 5610-REG: Pacific Airports Project Facility, for $600,000, approved on 21 December 1994.", "2\nareas of the Pacific, the radio signals encounter capacity limitations. As a result, the flight\ninformation regions (FIR) rely on procedural systems for ATC with little or no automation.\nSubsequently, the flights must be planned via intermediate way-points rather than on the most\ndirect routes. This has an adverse effect on aircraft operating costs.\n5. With the new satellite-based CNS/ATM, communications would be linked directly from\nthe satellite to the aircraft, and would not require a line-of-sight between the two. For navigation,\nCNS/ATM  includes  satellite  constellations,  aircraft  receivers,  and  monitoring  facilities.  An\nindependent on-board aircraft position-determination equipment is a key feature. Surveillance\nunder the CNS/ATM is carried out by automatic dependent surveillance (ADS). It allows the\naircraft  to  automatically  transmit  its  position  to  air  traffic  service  centers  via  data-link\ncommunications. The new system results in improved data handling and transfer of information\nbetween operators, aircraft, and air traffic services.\n6. At present, aircraft follow fixed routes based on navigation aids installed on the ground.\nThis creates congestion and prevents aircraft from taking cost-reducing operational advantage\nof weather. CNS/ATM allows aircraft to fly more direct routes, leading to reduced delays and\nsavings in fuel and equipment. Other benefits include enhanced safety, more efficient use of\nairspace and airport capacity, and uniform and cost-effective provision and maintenance of\nCNS. Implementing the CNS/ATM system promotes traffic growth, making the new system\neconomically  more  attractive  as  traffic  increases  over  time.  Consequently,  a  delay  in\nimplementing the system means loss of benefits in the near term. The air traffic management\nservices  that  can  be  provided  will  no  longer  be  constrained  by  the  limitations  of  existing\nterrestrial-based systems. The services can be provided from a single ATC center to large\noceanic  areas  and  thereby  transcend  the  traditional  compartmentalization  of  airspace\nestablished by FIR boundaries.\n7. Provision of upper airspace navigation services is currently the responsibility of eight\nservice providers under nine FIRs as shown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Upper Airspace Navigation Service Provision in Pacific Countries\nLocation Flight Information Region Service Provider\nAmerican Samoa (US) Nadi FIR CAAFI\nAustralia Brisbane Air Services Australia\nFiji Islands Nadi FIR CAAFI\nKiribati Nadi FIR CAAFI\nPapua New Guinea Port Moresby Dept. of Civil Aviation PNG\nSamoa Nadi FIR CAAFI\nTokelau (NZ) Nadi FIR CAAFI\nTonga Nadi FIR CAAFI\nTuvalu Nadi FIR CAAFI\nVanuatu Nadi FIR CAAFI\nNew Caledonia (FR) Nadi FIR CAAFI\nKiribati North-East Oakland FIR Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\nMarshall Islands Oakland FIR FAA\nMicronesia Oakland FIR FAA\nNauru Nauru FIR FAA\nNiue (NZ) Auckland FIR Airways Corporation NZ\nNew Zealand (NZ) Auckland FIR Airways Corporation NZ\nCook Islands Cook Sector Airways Corporation NZ\nSolomon Islands Honiara FIR Airservices Australia\nTahiti Tahiti FIR Dept. of Civil Aviation, Tahiti\nCAAFI=Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji Islands, FAA=Federal Aviation Administration, FIR=flight information region,\nFIS=flight information sector.", "3\n8. ADB's TA 5610: Pacific Airport Facilities (footnote 4) identified substantial economic\nbenefits in regional implementation and management of CNS/ATM. It recommended (i) the\nestablishment of the Pacific Airways Corporation (PAC) for the management of the unified\nregional air space, (ii) regional investment in CNS/ATM technology, and (iii) provision of upper\nairspace navigation services by PAC. Concurrently, the Airways Corporation of New Zealand\n(ACNZ) and Air Services Australia proposed to provide upper airspace navigation services\nunder airspace management contracts on behalf of the PDMCs.\n9. The TA supports the establishment of a unified airspace and CNS/ATM system in the\nPacific region. Unified airspace management yields significant safety benefits as navigation\nservices will be provided in a seamless airspace. It becomes unnecessary to transfer the control\nof  traffic  from  one  service  provider  to  another,  each  potentially  operating  under  varying\nstandards. Unified airspace management eliminates duplication of facilities, which is a cost\nconcern of the International Air Transport Association (IATA). As use of flexible flight tracks and\ndynamic  air  route  planning  (DARP)  become  feasible  through  implementation  of  CNS/ATM\ntechnology,  the  regional  approach  adopted  under  TA  ensures  reimbursement  for  the\nmaintenance of the aviation facilities of the participating States even when flight routes do not\npass  a  particular  State\u2019s  airspace.  Finally,  charges  for  a  unified  airspace  can  be  set  in\naccordance with the respective costs, while national airspace will have to align its charges with\nthose of the neighboring airspace regardless of the costs.\n10. An essential prerequisite to identification and development of a viable strategy for the\nmanagement of the airspace in the region is the definition of the operational, technical, financial,\neconomic, commercial, and socioeconomic objectives pursued under various available options.\nThese relate to the broader benefits of the options for trade, tourism, and transport sector\ngrowth, and, subsequently, acceleration of economic development in the region. The objectives\nof such a strategy are to (i) promote and enhance aviation safety; (ii) provide and support safe,\nefficient, cost-effective, and financially self-sufficient air navigation services; (iii) standardize and\nharmonize aeronautical services and procedures; (iv) rationalize aviation infrastructure and\nensure its sustainability; (v) promote commercial development in the aviation sector; (vi) satisfy\nthe demand for suitably qualified human resources in the aviation sector; (vii) provide PDMCs\nwith reasonable returns on aviation investments; and (viii) make civil aviation a catalyst for\npromotion of commerce, trade and tourism so that through the socioeconomic development of\nthe individual PDMCs, growth in the region is accelerated.\n11. In line with ADB's operational strategy in the Pacific, the TA supports a significant\nregional cooperative undertaking. Efficient communications and transport links have proven\nessential for enhancing growth in the Pacific. The TA will advance the safety and economic\nviability of the region\u2019s airspace. These benefits lead to reduced cost of air transport, fueling an\nincrease in air transport and travel and, subsequently, economic growth. The transition to\nCNS/ATM systems is one of the largest undertakings carried out by the aviation community\nworldwide. This is not only because of the scale of the change, but also because the transition\nwill fundamentally change the way in which air traffic services would be provided. ICAO has\ndeveloped an indicative schedule leading to a global implementation of CNS/ATM system by\n2010. Each provider is attempting to refurbish its depreciated navigation equipment with those\ncompatible  with  the  new  CNS/ATM  technology  in  accordance  with  the  Asia/Pacific\nImplementation Plan for the New CNS/ATM System of ICAO.\n12. Establishing  a  regional  management  and  service  provision  capacity  in  the  Pacific\n region is a unique  regional  effort. The TA supports development of a regional strategy for the", "4\ntransition to the CNS/ATM system in the region. The benefits from adopting a unified approach\nto upper and, also in some cases, lower airspace management have been assessed to be far\ngreater  than  those  from  fragmented  and  nationally  managed  CNS/ATM  systems.\nReimbursement to the PDMCs from the charges for CNS/ATM services will be directed to\nimprovement of national civil aviation, making air transport safer and more viable.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n13. The TA seeks to establish a feasible and viable strategy for transition to CNS/ATM-\nbased airspace management under conditions of amalgamated and unified airspace in the\nPacific region. The TA will (i) prepare a detailed feasibility analysis of options for provision of\nupper airspace navigation services using a CNS/ATM system; and (ii) evaluate the distribution\nof costs and benefits to the PDMCs, and impacts on economic development and growth.\nB. Scope\n14. The TA includes preparation and achieving consensus on (i) a strategic implementation\naction  plan  for  cooperative  airspace  management,  (ii)  an  organizational  framework  for\nmanagement of airspace, (iii) cost-benefit analysis for each PDMC, (iv) macroeconomic review\nof the socioeconomic and growth-related benefits arising from civil aviation development, (v) a\nstrategic human resource plan for airspace management purposes, and (vi) funding and other\nresource  requirements  for  establishing  cooperative  airspace  management  and  preparing\nrelevant  financial  packages  for  external  funding.  The  detailed  terms  of  reference  are  in\nAppendix 2.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The RETA is estimated to cost $497,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by ADB on\na grant basis in the amount of $350,000 from the ADB-funded TA program. ADB financing will\ncover  remuneration  and  per  diem  charges  of  the  consultants,  travel  and  transportation,\nreporting, and workshops. ICAO will finance additional consultant services in the amount of\n$147,000 on a grant basis.
