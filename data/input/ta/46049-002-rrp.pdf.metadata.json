THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Xinjiang Akesu Integrated Urban Development \nand Environment Improvement Project.1  \n \n2.  The project will improve much-needed urban infrastructure facilities and the environment \nin  Akesu  City,  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  (XUAR).  As  the  first  proposed  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) urban sector loan in southern XUAR, the project will contribute to \nsustainable economic growth and improve the quality of life for about 509,200 urban residents in \nAkesu, with a specific focus on the rehabilitation and upgrading of existing urban areas with high \nethnic minority populations. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Located in the northwest of the PRC, XUAR is a remote region linking the PRC to \nCentral Asia. Despite recent economic development due to the expansion of agriculture and \nextractive industries, XUAR remains one of the poorest and least-developed regions in the PRC. \nIn 2013, XUAR\u2019s average urban per capita disposable income was the second lowest in the \nPRC,  at  CNY19,874.2 XUAR  is  one  of  the  less-developed  western  regions  targeted  for \naccelerated  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction  by  the  preferential  policies \nunder the National Strategy for Development of the West. XUAR has a large ethnic minority \npopulation: the Uygur account for 45.73% of the total population and other ethnic minority \ngroups for 14.77%. The regional capital, Urumqi, with a population of 3.1 million, and the \npopulated urban centers in the northern part of the region are the main industrial hubs. They are \nalso the primary points of public infrastructure investment and private sector activities. On the \nother hand, investments in the southern part of XUAR, mainly constituted of mountains and \ndesert areas, lag behind. The development of an arc-shaped urban and transport corridor \nbetween the southern piedmont of Tianshan Mountain and the northern rim of Taklamakan \nDesert is an opportunity to achieve a more balanced level of development across the region. \n \n4.  Five oases cities exist along highway A314 and the national railway, each with an urban \npopulation between 300,000 and 700,000. Over time, agricultural expansion, poorly managed \nurbanization, and extractive industries have degraded the local environment, decreasing the \nsustainability of these cities. These cities are the only urban centers capable of clustering \neconomic activities in the southern part of the region.  \n \n5.  Akesu is a medium-sized city in southern XUAR established as an oasis town on the \nhistoric Silk Road. In 2013, its poverty incidence was 5.45% for the urban population, and \n12.3% for the rural population. Akesu has a higher poverty rate than regional and national \naverages. The city has expanded in recent years following (i) economic growth in agricultural \nproduction, (ii) exploration and processing of oil and gas, and (iii) regional and intercity transport \nimprovements. The urban population grew from 422,470 in 2005 to 509,200 in 2013, reaching \nan urbanization rate of 61.2%, while the built-up area expanded from 27 square kilometers (km2) \nto 46.5 km2 over the same period. Although the burgeoning city benefits from a good economic \noutlook, inadequate infrastructure investment in existing areas and environmental degradation \nare contributing to a poorer quality of life. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  2013 statistical bulletins of socioeconomic development in the PRC and XUAR. ", "2 \n \n6.  Akesu\u2019s  long-term  sustainable  development  requires  socially  and  environmentally \nresponsible  management  of  its  urbanization.  It  urgently  needs  to  tackle  its  significant \ndeficiencies in urban infrastructure and services;3 as current access to water, sanitation, and \nheating  in  Akesu  is  low  and  variable.  Meanwhile,  poor  land  use  and  waste  management \npractices threaten environmental conditions in Akesu\u2019s rivers and wetlands. While improved \nservices will reduce the negative impact of urbanization on the environment in Akesu, additional \nmeasures are needed to rehabilitate and preserve the water resources for the city and the larger \nwatershed. The Akesu Duolang wetlands, located within the ecological conservation zone of the \npilot  Xinjiang  Akesu  Duolang  River  National  Wetland  Park,  provide  important  ecosystem \nservices.  These  include  groundwater  replenishment,  flood  retention,  sediment  and  nutrient \nremoval,  micro-climate  regulation,  cultural  services,  and  biodiversity  conservation. 4  The \nrehabilitation of these wetlands will enhance the National Wetland Park network in the PRC, \nprovide a demonstration of wise wetland use as promoted by the Ramsar Convention, and \ncontribute to improved water resources management within the Tarim River Basin. 5 \n \n7.  The proposed project aims to improve municipal services in the project area significantly: \n(i) the households with connection to piped urban water supply would increase from 52.6%  to \n88.6%, (ii) the households with sewerage connections would increase from 8.0% to 66.6%, (iii) \nthe area with access to central heating would increase from 12.7% to 87.0%, and (iv) the \nhouseholds covered by solid waste management would increase from 18.7% to 100%. The \nurban road component is aligned with the Comprehensive Transportation Planning of the Urban \nCenter Area of Akesu (2013\u20132030) to improve conditions and connectivity of the urban road \nnetwork in Akesu for all users on arterial, secondary, collector, and lane-scale roads.6 The peri-\nurban  communities  targeted  for  improvement  under  the  residential  alley  component  are \ninhabited  mostly  by  ethnic  minorities.  The  improvement  of  services  will  have  large \nenvironmental  impacts,  including  interception  of  some  21,600  cubic  meters  of  currently \nuncollected wastewater, reducing contamination of the Akesu water resources.7  \n \n8.  Strategic fit. The project is consistent with the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2010\u2013\n2015), and these urbanization policies, priorities, and agendas will continue into the Thirteenth \nFive-Year  Plan.  The  project  supports  environmentally  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic \ngrowth, which is a key priority of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 as well as the Midterm Review of \nStrategy  2020.8 It  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for \ninclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth.9 It  also  conforms  to  (i)  ADB\u2019s  Water \nOperational Plan, as the project encourages water and wastewater management, and wetland \nand biodiversity protection; (ii) ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, which fosters competitive, green, \nand inclusive cities by promoting connectivity, road safety, waste management, and urban \nsanitation; and (iii) ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan by supporting road \n                                                \n3  The direct project areas cover 31 km2 in central Akesu. \n4  The wetlands provide a critical link for migratory birds in the Central Asian flyway. \n5  Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (1971). Ramsar, Iran. http://www.ramsar.org/ \n6  While there are no current plans to create new mass transit networks in Akesu, the urban road component \nsupports existing bus networks and maintains adequate space for future development of rapid transit. \n7  This will result in an estimated reduction of 9,280 tons per year of chemical oxygen demand, 39 tons per year of \ntotal phosphorus, and 32 tons per year of total nitrogen. \n8  ADB. 2008.

That plan aims to (i) improve the \nurban services of small towns and (ii) establish harmonious and pleasant living conditions in \ncities with improved infrastructure, public services, and environment.11 Finally, the project will \nalso support the PRC's National Wetland Conservation Program (2004\u20132030).12  \n \n9.  This is the fifth project of the strategic urban sector partnership between XUAR and \nADB. ADB\u2019s value addition can be seen in the optimization of project design, reduction of \nresettlement impacts and costs, as well as the incorporation of lessons and special features. \n \n10.  Incorporation of lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from previous ADB-\nfinanced urban development projects, emphasizing holistic urban development approaches to \nsupport  the  development  of  livable  cities  with  universal  access.13 The  project  focuses  on \nimproving access to urban water supply, sewerage, and heating services in existing urban areas \nrather than the establishment of new districts. The project has been informed by the lessons \nfrom ADB\u2019s water and wastewater tariff studies, which developed the National Guidelines on \nWater Tariffs.14 Akesu, being in an ethnic minority and poverty area, is currently exempted from \nthe 1998 National Regulation for Urban Water Tariff Management. The project will, however, \npromote cost-recovery and progressive tariffs in line with national standards through institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building.15 The project will follow the reduce, reuse, recycle (3R) \nprinciples adopted in previous ADB projects in XUAR.16 \n \n11.  Special  features.  In  line  with  the  integrated  nature  of  the  project,  several  special \nfeatures have been developed and are supported by capacity building. First, two \u201cliving street\u201d \npilots will be designed in low-income, ethnic minority communities of Akesu, aiming to create \nsocial and shared spaces where people can meet and children can play safely by reducing the \nspeed and dominance of motorized transport in these areas. The pilot locations will be selected \nin a participatory process with affected communities. Second, the road component will be \nsupported by urban traffic planning with an emphasis on nonmotorized traffic, including the \npreparation of a human-centered urban transport master plan for the city of Akesu, and the \ndesign and implementation of a public education program on traffic safety. Third, the project will \ncontribute to the development of a citywide solid waste management road map, with defined \nshort-, medium-, and long-term targets, including support to the development of a 3R-oriented \nintegrated solid waste management plan. Finally, the wetland rehabilitation component will \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2012. Water Operational Plan (2011\u20132020). Manila; ADB. 2013.

Knowledge  sharing  on  these  initiatives  will  be \npromoted through the production and dissemination of related knowledge products. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The project impact will be socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable urbanization \nin Akesu. The project outcome will be the improvement of municipal services and environment \nquality. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The project will take a strategic and holistic approach to urban development where the \ninadequate  and  outdated  urban  services  and  degraded  ecosystems  have  constrained  the \nopportunities for the city to develop in an environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive \nmanner. The project interventions are expected to produce three primary outputs. \n \n14.  Output  1:  Urban  infrastructure  and  services  improved.  This  comprises  of  six \ncomponents with inclusive employment opportunities: (i) about 75 kilometers (km) of urban \nroads constructed or upgraded\u201419 roads upgraded, two new roads built, alleys upgraded in \nfour ethnically concentrated, peri-urban communities, and two pilot \u201cliving streets\u201d developed; \nabout 162 bus stops, 19 km of separated motorized and nonmotorized lanes, one pedestrian \noverpass, and two new bridges constructed; associated traffic signals, street lights, and utility \npipelines built or upgraded, plus landscaping; (ii) public park and green spaces upgraded, and a \ntree nursery established; (iii) about 38 km of urban water supply pipes laid; (iv) about 78 km of \nurban sewerage infrastructure constructed; (v) about 44 km of central heating pipelines and \nassociated heat exchange stations built; and (vi) street cleaning, waste collection, transportation \nequipment and vehicles procured, and one waste transfer station constructed. \n \n15.  Output 2: Akesu Duolang wetland rehabilitated and protected. Interventions toward \nthis output will be within the ecological conservation and restoration zone of the Akesu Duolang \nRiver National Wetland Park, and involve (i) rehabilitating about 95 hectares (ha) of degraded \nwetland; (ii) establishing about 4 ha of forest shelter belts; (iii) constructing wetland protection \ninfrastructure; (iv) improving wildlife protection through wetland monitoring facilities; and (v) \nestablishing a wildlife rescue and disease control center, and public wetland education facilities. \n \n16.  Output 3: Project and urban environmental management and inclusive capacity \nenhanced. The capacity of local project partners for the successful implementation, operation, \nand management of project facilities will be enhanced by (i) preparing and updating a project \nperformance  management  system;  (ii)  undertaking  tendering,  procurement,  contract \nmanagement,  and  financial  management;  (iii)  carrying  out  construction  supervision; \n(iv) conducting stakeholder consultations; (v) ensuring environmental and social safeguards; \n(vi) undertaking  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (vii)  meeting  reporting  requirements; \n(viii) providing about 2,000 person-times of public training, including 50% women and ethnic \nminorities; and (ix) providing technical guidance on environmentally sustainable and socially \ninclusive urban infrastructure.17 \n \nD.

The government  has requested  a  loan  of $150  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have (i) a 26-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; will follow the straight-line repayment method; (ii) an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility;18 (iii) a commitment charge of 0.15% per year on undisbursed funds; and (iv) such other \nterms and conditions as are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The ADB loan \nwill cover civil works, equipment, engineering installation, project management and capacity \nbuilding, and financing charges during construction. The ADB loan will also finance taxes and \nduties included in the base cost. The financing charges during construction are estimated at \n$5.85 million; of which $3 million will be financed through ADB loan as capitalized interest and \ncharges.  The  loan  will  finance  59.76%  of  the  total  project  cost  and  the  Akesu  Municipal \nGovernment (AMG) will finance the remaining 40.24% (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  150.00  59.76 \nAkesu Municipal Government  100.99  40.24 \nTotal  250.99  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  A comprehensive analysis of the feasibility of the seven engineering elements within the \noutput components was undertaken. The technical designs are suitable for local circumstances, \ntopography,  and  climate  (arid  desert  conditions  with  long,  harsh  winters),  consistent  with \nstrategic and sector priorities, and PRC design guidelines and local regulations. The demand \nprojections  for  the  urban  infrastructure  services  were  assessed  to  be  appropriate.  Design \noptions were compared and appropriate technologies and alternatives with the least costs and \n                                                \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nleast  environmental  and  social  impacts  were  selected.  The  design  of  the  Akesu  Duolang \nwetland  rehabilitation  component  incorporates  state-of-the-art  scientific  principles  and \ninternational and national good practices, and takes into account local climatic and hydrological \nconditions. A detailed final design will be undertaken by a class A design institute, and start-up \nconsultants will provide procurement support during the advance action period. The capacity-\nbuilding component was formulated on the basis of a comprehensive assessment of the local \nneeds for successfully implementing and operating project facilities, and incorporates innovative \nfeatures with respect to environment-friendly and socially inclusive urban infrastructure planning, \nawareness building for road safety, public education and demonstration for road-sharing and \nwaste 3Rs, and public education for wetland and biodiversity protection. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic  analysis. An economic analysis, with a cost\u2013benefit analysis, sensitivity \nanalysis, and distributional analysis, was conducted for all physical components.20 The least-\ncost analysis confirms the selection of technologies and alternatives for individual components. \nThe cost\u2013benefit analysis considered direct impacts on beneficiaries. The analysis confirmed \nthat the project outputs and the overall project are economically viable, with an economic \ninternal rate of return for the overall project of 23.6%, which exceeds the economic opportunity \ncost  of  capital  of  12%.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  urban  development \ncomponent is 26.0%, and for the Akesu Duolang wetland component it is 13.3%. The sensitivity \nanalysis shows that the project remains economically viable in the event of a 10% increase in \ncost and 10% decrease in benefit. \n \n23.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis includes (i) the project\u2019s fiscal impact on the \nfinances of the AMG as the ultimate borrower of the loan, and (ii) the financial viability of the \ncost-recovery element of the central heating component. 21 The fiscal impact was assessed by \ncomparing the annual revenues from the AMG\u2019s identified financing sources with the annual \ncounterpart funds required for (i) capital expenditures during project implementation and (ii) \nrecurrent costs for operation and maintenance and debt service during operations. The analysis \nindicates  that  the  AMG  is  able  to  finance  counterpart  funds,  service  debts,  and  recurrent \noperation  and  maintenance  costs.  The  fiscal  risk  assumed  by  the  AMG  in  financing  the \ncomponent parts is assessed to be acceptable. The financial viability analysis for the central \nheating component shows that the financial internal rate of return, estimated at 8.03%, is higher \nthan the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 1.78%. The financial analysis and related \nsensitivity analysis find the project components financially viable. \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  its  Accountability \nMechanism Policy22 were explained to and discussed with the XUAR government and the AMG. \nThe procurement capacity assessment of the AMG concluded that the procedural arrangements \nare  adequate  to  ensure  full  compliance  with  ADB  procurement  guidelines  considering  the \nsupport that will be provided by the Akesu Public Resources Trading Center, the international \ntendering company, and the loan implementation consultant.23 The financial management risk \nhas been assessed as moderate.The project financial management arrangements are adequate. \nThe specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n                                                \n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB. 2012.

The project is expected to improve the mobility and accessibility, sanitation and public \nhealth, and livelihoods for the people of Akesu. The project will directly benefit 263,830 people, \nof which 122,420 or 46.4% are ethnic minorities, and 44,320 people or 16.8% are poor. It will \ngenerate 12,130 person-years of  direct employment during the construction phase and 2,761 \nperson-years of direct employment during the operational phase.24 The XUAR government and \nthe AMG have committed to prioritizing the employment of vulnerable groups, including women, \nthe poor, and ethnic minorities. Project implementation units will ensure that all PRC labor laws \nand core labor standards are respected. Details on specific measures will ensure that poverty \nand social benefits are in the social and gender action plan in the PAM and ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan. Social and gender indicators will be included in the project performance \nmanagement system, and appropriate consultant inputs for implementation and monitoring of \nboth plans are included in the supervision consultant package.25 \n \n26.  Gender benefits. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. It will \nhave significant benefits for women by reducing the energy, time, and effort spent on their \nroutine household activities as well as allowing them greater participation in income-generating \nactivities. Women strongly support the project across all components, and perceive that it will \nimprove their quality of life and create employment and income for them. A gender action plan \nwas prepared, including specific targets for women\u2019s employment and participation. 26 The plan \nwill help ensure (i) women\u2019s participation in the project, including a target for at least 45% \nemployment  for  women  (including  ethnic  minorities);  (ii)  participation  and  gender-sensitive \npublic training on public road safety, solid waste management, and wetland protection, with up \nto 50% female participation (and staff training participation up to 30% female); (iii) participation \nin  capacity-building  activities;  and  (iv)  appropriate  gender  targets,  indicators,  and  sex-\ndisaggregated data for project monitoring and evaluation. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  Environment (category B). The AMG prepared an initial environmental examination \nthat complies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and was disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite on 25 February 2015.27 The anticipated impacts will be localized, short-term, reversible, \nand  effectively  mitigated  by  applying  good  construction  practices  as  defined  in  the \nenvironmental  management  plan.  During  construction,  dust,  noise,  and  temporary  traffic \ndisturbance generated by road rehabilitation activities will be a nuisance to nearby residents. All \nroads will be developed with safe and adequately wide footpaths, fully segregated nonmotorized \nlanes, and public transport facilities. The rehabilitation of the Duolang wetlands will require \nsignificant construction activities with temporary impact on existing wetland functions. However, \nthe project is expected to greatly boost these functions by significantly increasing the value of \nthe wetland\u2019s ecosystem services.28 The project will also have substantial pollution-abatement \nbenefits.29 The climate risk to the project is medium.30 Akesu River runoff will significantly \n                                                \n24 These targets are disaggregated by component in the design and monitoring Framework (Appendix 1). \n25 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 The two-page gender action plan was prepared based on the combined social and gender action plan included in \nthe PAM and assurances. Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 The wetland biotope will provide regulating services (e.g., water storage, supply and treatment, and micro-climate \nregulation), supporting services (biodiversity maintenance by providing resting, feeding, and breeding habitats for \nwildlife such as migratory water birds), and cultural services (including tourism, research, and recreation). \n29 29.3 million liters of fuel can be saved per year from improved road conditions and connectivity, resulting in the \nreduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 215,000 tons per year. The use of waste heat from a combined heat and \npower plant will result in the closure of 28 small, low-efficiency boilers, which will reduce coal use by 25,900 tons \n ", "9 \nincrease due to increased snow and glacier melt in the Tianshan Mountains. All project roads \nwill include high-capacity culverts and separate storm- and wastewater-collection systems. The \nrehabilitation and protection of the Duolang wetlands is an important measure to enhance \nclimate resilience by increasing number and diversity of habitats on the Central Asian flyway. \n \n28.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). A resettlement plan was prepared following \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and posted on the ADB website on 27 February 2015.31 \nBased on the resettlement impact survey, the urban road component and the wetland output will \nhave land acquisition and resettlement impacts. A total of 184 households and 790 persons will \nbe affected by the project. In total, 1,502.93 mu (100.2 ha) of land will be permanently acquired; \nincluding 825.13 mu (55 ha) state-owned land and 677.8 mu (45.19 ha) of collective-owned land, \nwhich will affect 176 households with 740 persons.32 Of the collectively owned land acquired, \n66.5% (450.6 mu or 30 ha) is cultivated land. Along with land acquisition, 5,655 square meters \nof residential structures will be demolished, affecting 21 households with 120 persons. About 13 \nhouseholds and 70 persons will be affected by both land acquisition and resettlement. The \nresettlement plan was disclosed to affected persons, and resettlement information booklets \nwere distributed in January 2015. Appropriate livelihood-restoration measures associated with \nresettlement  are  incorporated  in  the  resettlement  plan.  The  project  will  also  establish  a \ntransparent grievance redress mechanism that will provide meaningful consultation and ensure \nthat  remedial  action  is  taken  as  necessary  during  project  implementation.  An  external \nresettlement monitor or a firm will be engaged to conduct semiannual monitoring and evaluation \nof resettlement implementation and submit reports to the AMG and ADB. The AMG\u2019s capacity \nfor resettlement will be strengthened. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government has \nassured ADB that adequate funds for resettlement will be made available on a timely basis \nduring project implementation.  \n \n29.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Ethnic minorities constitute 46.4% of the population \nin the direct project area and 53.6% in the indirect area in Akesu. Although urban communities \nare ethnically mixed, some aspects such as cultural, religious, and linguistic differences are \nmaintained.  All  households  in  the  urban  areas  will  benefit  from  the  new  and  upgraded \ninfrastructure  services  and  rehabilitated  wetlands.  Ethnic  minorities  will  not  be  adversely \naffected, except for 172 Uygur minority households (land acquisition) and 18 other households \n(residential house demolition). An ethnic minority development plan has been prepared and \nendorsed by the AMG.33 The plan focuses on measures to facilitate the inclusion of ethnic \nminorities in all project activities, and ensure that their customs and beliefs will be respected \nthroughout project implementation. The ethnic minority development plan was disclosed on 23 \nJanuary 2015 to ethnic minorities in the areas targeted by the project. Monitoring and reporting \narrangements are included in the PAM and in the project agreement. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan. 34 The integrated benefits and impacts are \n                                                                                                                                                       \nper year, resulting in significant emission reductions\u2014sulfur dioxide: 173 tons, nitrogen oxides: 1,559 tons, and \ncarbon dioxide: 64,000 tons. \n30 Annual mean temperatures are projected to increase significantly in the project area, while precipitation is \nprojected to slightly decrease. \n31 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.7 square meters). \n33 Indigenous Peoples Plan: Ethnic Minority Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nexpected to outweigh costs and risks. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigation Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak capacity of the AMG as the  AMG and APMO will set up clear institutional arrangements, recruit \nimplementing agency to effectively  qualified staff, and build capacity through training provided by the loan \nwithdraw ADB loan proceeds, resulting in  implementation consultant and the PRC Resident Mission. \ndisbursement and construction delays \nXinjiang Project Management Office will ensure that the APMO and \nimplementing agencies with experience from other ADB projects in \nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region share their knowledge. \nLack of procurement capacity for ADB or  Engage start-up consultant to support preparation of bidding \nother foreign-funded projects, resulting in  documents, including technical specifications, and the actual bidding \npoor preparation of the procurement plan  process before loan implementation consultants are mobilized. \nand bidding documents; poor \nProvide implementation consulting support for technical specifications in \nmanagement of the procurement process, \nthe bidding documents. \nand significant delay of the process \nDelay of land acquisition and resettlement  AMG assures the availability of counterpart funding with detailed \ndue to a shortage of counterpart funding  financing plan. \nor unforeseen problems arising during \nUpdate the resettlement plan based on the final design and survey. \nLAR negotiation \nInstitutional strengthening and training for carrying out LAR tasks. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AMG = Akesu Municipal Government, APMO = Akesu Project Management Office, \nLAR = land acquisition and resettlement. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.
