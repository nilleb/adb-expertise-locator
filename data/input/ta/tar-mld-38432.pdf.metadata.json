As requested by the Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) included the \nproposed  TA  in  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (CSPU)  2005\u20132006  for  the \nMaldives.1  The  TA  will  assist  in  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  External  Resource \nManagement  (ERM)  Section  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT)  in  financial \nplanning, and project management and monitoring.2 It will also help upgrade the knowledge and \nskills of project staff and officials of the line ministries in project implementation, monitoring, and \nprocurement  procedures.  In  addition,  the  TA  will  help  prepare  staff  of  ERM,  selected  line \nministries,  and  educational  institutions  to  become  trainers  for  project  management  and \nmonitoring. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As of 31 December 2004, ADB\u2019s total public sector lending to the Maldives stood at \n$89.7 million for 14 loans and $17 million for 50 TAs. ADB\u2019s current portfolio in the country \ncomprises seven active loans and one tsunami emergency loan/grant with a total value of $48.4 \nmillion.3 After the tsunami, a Tsunami Emergency Assistance Project (TEAP) of $21.8 million \ngrant and loan was approved on 31 March 2005.4 Further, three tsunami-related TAs for a total \nof $1.65 million were also processed expeditiously and are expected to be approved before July \n2005. For 2006\u20132008, an indicative total lending of $18 million is tentatively programmed for the \ncountry. Five firm projects (domestic maritime transport, small and medium-sized enterprise \n[SME] development in the atolls, islands electrification, commercialization of agriculture, and \nsocial  infrastructure  for  regional  development  projects)  are  in  the  pipeline.  In  addition,  an \nindicative  nonlending  assistance  of  $3  million,  or  an  annual  average  of  $1  million,  is \nprogrammed for 2006\u20132008.  \n \n3.  In  the  wake  of  the  tsunami,  development  partners  of  the  Maldives  are  providing \nemergency assistance to the country. The World Bank has extended emergency post-tsunami \nsupport  in  the  form  of  quick-disbursing  emergency  assistance  of  $14  million  (International \nDevelopment Association [IDA] money). A further $12 million in IDA assistance is expected in \nFY2006 from IDA XIV resources. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved $6.3 \nmillion in emergency assistance to help the Government deal with the devastating effect of the \ntsunami.  The  Government  of  Japan  has  extended  a  $20  million  grant  for  post-tsunami \nrehabilitation and reconstruction. The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) allocated $55.5 million \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 18 March 2005. \n2  External Resource Management (ERM) Section is responsible for external debt management, coordination of \nmultilateral funding agencies, development project management, monitoring and evaluation. \n3 These are: ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nto the Maldives for relief assistance, concessional loans for rehabilitation and reconstruction of \nsocial  sector  facilities,  and  ordinary  loans  to  finance  importation  of  materials  for  the \nreconstruction activities. The European Union Commission (EC), Republic of Korea, Kingdom of \nSaudi Arabia, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and United States of America have \ncommitted and pledged recovery and reconstruction assistance, which is still to be decided and \nwill have to be implemented rapidly once approved. It is expected that in 2005 the country will \nhave to implement rehabilitation and recovery projects of about $200 million, nearly 20 times the \nregular annual implementation before the tsunami. \n \n4.  Implementation  and  monitoring  of  ongoing  and  new  projects,  including  tsunami \nemergency assistance projects and the newly created economic recovery and reconstruction \nplan,  to  be  funded  by  development  partners,  will  be  a  big  challenge  to  the  Government, \nespecially to MOFT, which generally serves as Executing Agency for all those projects. For \nMOFT  to  effectively  coordinate,  manage,  and  monitor  project  implementation  activities  in \nsupport of the line ministries, there is an urgent need to review its organizational structure and \nstrengthen its operational systems and the capacity of its staff, especially those in the ERM \nSection.5  \n \n5.  The ERM Section is one of the three sections supervised by the Executive Director, \nCorporate Affairs Division: Administration and Human Resources Section, ERM Section, and \nInformation Systems Section. Currently there are nine technical staff members under ERM \nincluding 6 for the external debt and resource management function, and 3 for monitoring and \nmanagement of externally financed projects. Most technical staff are below 30 years of age, \n1.5\u201310 years work experience with MOFT. Most staff possess qualification below degree level: \nfour have a diploma in business administration, two has a bachelor\u2019s diploma and one has a \nmasters degree. The result is a serious lack of middle-level supervisors to link the technical staff \nand the section\u2019s supervisor. \n \n6.  There  is  lack  of  well-established  or  standard  operational  system  mechanism  and \nprocedures that could help set priorities and guide the activities of the staff. With the assistance \nof more experienced colleagues, new staff learn the operational system and work procedures in \na piecemeal manner. Currently, no system or procedures are available at ERM to enable the \nstaff to perform their tasks effectively. The reporting system and feedback mechanisms between \nMOFT and line ministries have to be established and made operational. The database and \nmanagement information system (MIS) for internal administration and loan portfolio monitoring \nand management are not available.6 Staff productivity and efficiency are adversely affected as \nthey have to spend time going through old records and files to get needed information and data. \nThere is an urgent need to develop a computerized MIS for loan portfolio monitoring and \nmanagement, and for internal management of the ERM Section. \n \n7.  On 1 June 2004, the Tender Evaluation Section (TES) was transferred to MOFT from \nthe then Ministry of Construction and Public Works. TES handles procurement contracts valued \n                                                 \n5  The ERM section was formerly called the Financial Institutions and External Debt Management Section (FIEDMS). \nAfter the tsunami, MOFT is responsible for coordinating and monitoring external assistance; the Ministry of \nPlanning and National Development (MPND), for coordinating data gathering and long-term responses; and the \nMinistry of Defense (MOD), for overall relief efforts. \n6  In view of recovery from the effects of the tsunami, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is \nproviding a TA to assist the Government in establishing a development assistance database (DAD) at the \nERM/Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT). Technical training in using the database is also being provided. \nADB consultants for this TA will take into account activities and training already provided by UNDP to MOFT/ERM \nto complement ADB\u2019s TA. \n ", "  3\nabove Rf500,000 (around $39,062) for Government projects. After the tsunami, World Bank \nagreed  to  include  strengthening  of  TES  as  part  of  an  emergency  assistance  program. \nConsequently, capacity building for TES is not included in this TA.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is to improve the efficiency and quality of project management and monitoring in \nMOFT. Specifically, the TA will support MOFT (i) in developing a system, including a MIS, for \neffective management and monitoring of projects funded by international financing institutions, \nand (ii) in strengthening the capacity of the staff of the ERM Section and senior officials of \nMOFT  in  financial  planning,  and  project  management  and  monitoring  to  support  the  line \nministries. The TA will help strengthen the structure, functions, and operational system of the \nERM Section and enhance the capacity of its staff in project management and monitoring, \ndisbursement procedures, procurement procedures, and training so as to become trainers in \ntheir specialized functions. In addition, the TA will help develop and establish an MIS at the \nERM Section to serve as a database for managing and monitoring project implementation \nactivities in the line ministries. The TA will incorporate activities to strengthen the role of MOFT \nin  managing  tsunami  emergency  projects  and  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  programs. \nFinally, the TA will support the line ministries by strengthening project implementation capacity \nthrough the establishment of a project monitoring function and mechanisms and training for the \nproject staff. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA activities will be organized into three related components: \n \n(i)  Component I: review and strengthen the organizational structure, operational \nsystem and procedures; prepare an operation manual on project management \nand monitoring for the ERM Section; develop and install an MIS that contains the \nnecessary structure, format, operational systems, and data for managing and \nmonitoring projects funded by international financing institutions; and prepare an \noperations manual for the MIS.  \n \n(ii)  Component II: in-country training and workshops for staff of the ERM Section and \nthe line ministries on project management, implementation, and monitoring; in-\ncountry training on the operations and management of MIS for the ERM staff; \nand international training and study visits not longer than 6 months each for \nsenior officials of MOFT and selected ERM staff. \n \n(iii)  Component III: development of a curriculum and training materials on project \nmanagement,  implementation,  and  monitoring  and  standard  procurement \nprocedures followed by ADB and the Government of the Maldives; establishment \nof a capacity-building unit for project management and monitoring, in the ERM \nSection; and conduct of a training-of-trainers program on project management \nand procurement procedures for staff of the ERM Section and line ministries. \n \n \n \n ", "4   \n10.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  outputs  will  be  sustained  through  continuous  training  and \ndevelopment of staff of the ERM and line ministries and through systematic follow-up and close \nmonitoring by MOFT. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $295,000 equivalent, comprising $199,000 in \nforeign exchange and $96,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $250,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $51,000 of \nthe local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe Government will finance the remaining $45,000 equivalent mainly through contributions in \nkind for office accommodation, counterpart support services, administrative and logistic support, \nand other related services. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  MOFT will be the Executing Agency of the TA through the ERM Section. The EA will \ncoordinate and supervise TA activities and will provide TA coordinators and counterpart staff \nwith office space and facilities. The EA will be responsible for coordinating, directing, and \nmonitoring the activities of the consultants and counterpart staff. The EA will also be responsible \nfor procuring equipment. Further, it will ensure that equipment acquired under the TA for the \ndevelopment and establishment of the MIS and for training, workshops, and seminars will be \navailable for the use of the consultants during the TA period. An equipment list will be prepared \nby the EA and consultants for ADB\u2019s approval. The equipment will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  and  will  be  turned  over  to  MOFT/ERM  upon  TA \ncompletion. \n  \n13.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 12 months starting in September 2005 with \nthe fielding of the consultants. The TA will engage one international consultant (6 person-\nmonths)  with  expertise  in  project  management,  procurement  procedures,  and  training \nexperience; and two domestic consultants (5 person-months) with expertise in development and \nimplementation  of  MIS  and  training.  The  international  and  domestic  consultants  may  be \nrecruited either through a firm or as individuals. They will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting \nand engaging of consultants. The methodology and terms of reference for the TA are specific \nand clearly identified. Hence, ADB\u2019s procedures for simplified technical proposals will be used \nas the basis for contract negotiation. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  The international consultant will work closely with ERM/MOFT in identifying international \ntraining programs and study visits for senior officials of MOFT and selected staff of the ERM \nSection. The list of the training programs, training institutions, and MOFT officials and ERM staff \nselected for international training will be submitted to ADB for approval before the proposed \ntraining programs and study visits are implemented. ADB will be responsible for (i) the general \nadministration and supervision of the TA, (ii) consultant selection and contract administration, \nand  (iii)  review  and  approval  of  international  study  visits  and  training  programs,  and \nprocurement of equipment and materials. The TA will be implemented in close coordination with \nthe line ministries and other funding agencies especially the United Nations (UN) agencies, \nWorld Bank, and IsDB to ensure that the system and procedures developed under the TA will \nmeet the requirements for management and monitoring of projects financed by those funding \nagencies. \n \n ", "  5\n15.  The international consultant will prepare and submit reports and related documents to \nMOFT and ADB including an inception report at the end of month 1 and, an interim progress \nreport at the end of month 3. A final report that includes recommendations to sustain the \nestablished project management and monitoring system and the MIS is to be submitted at the \nend before the completion of the TA.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Maldives for Strengthening Project Management and Monitoring for the \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms  \nImpact       \n      Assumption \nTo contribute effectively to  \u2022  Effective management  \u2022 MOFT reports on external  \u2022  MOFT management and \ngood governance through  and monitoring of  debt planning,  staff remain committed to \ngood management and  external foreign debts in  management, and servicing  improving their \nspeedy implementation of  line with Government  \u2022 Annual reports on status of  performance. \nnational development  policy and capacity to  project implementation. \nprojects  service the debts  \u2022 TA completion reports \n  \u2022 National development \n  projects completed \neffectively and timely \nwithin allocated budget \nto benefit their \nbeneficiaries \nOutcome       \n      Assumptions \nImproved efficiency and  \u2022 Reduced delays in  \u2022 Quarterly progress reports  \u2022 MOFT and the line ministries \nquality of project  project implementation  on status of project  will adopt the project \nmanagement and  \u2022 Increased successfully  implementation  management system and \nmonitoring through better  rated projects  \u2022 ADB supervision missions  procedures and carry out the \nproject management  implemented according  \u2022 Midterm report, final report,  project monitoring activities to \nsystem and procedures  to ADB\u2019s rating system  and TA completion report  ensure efficient and smooth \nand better trained and    implementation of the \nmore professional project    projects. \nmanagement personnel  \u2022 ERM staff and selected \nand trainers  individuals can serve as \n  trainers to help improve \nproject management capacity \nof PIU/PMU staff in the line \nministries. \nOutputs       \n      Assumptions \n3.1.
