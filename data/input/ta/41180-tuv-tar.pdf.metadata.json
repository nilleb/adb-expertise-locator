INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Tuvalu (the Government) requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to support its fiscal stability and capacity-building \ninitiatives, in conjunction with a proposed ADB program grant of $3.24 million. The need to \nestablish strategies and frameworks to identify, manage, and mitigate fiscal risk, as well as to \nreview the ownership of government enterprises and improve their financial and management \nperformance, has been recognized in Te Kakeega II1 and ADB external assessment of Tuvalu.2  \n \n2.  The Fact-Finding Mission3 visited Tuvalu during 1\u20138 July 2008 to assess the relevance \nand scope of this TA.4 Discussions were held with representatives of the Government and other \nstakeholders, and understanding was reached on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services. \nThe TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Tuvalu relies heavily on its public sector to drive growth, but it is inefficient and unwieldy. \nTuvalu is unique in that its external earnings are twice the gross domestic product, leaving it \nvulnerable to global forces. Since 2003, Tuvalu has experienced a decline in key offshore \nrevenues. Earnings from fish licenses have declined significantly as climatic conditions have \nsuppressed the number of fish found in its exclusive economic zone. In addition, the returns on \nits  popular  \u201c.tv\u201d  domain  name  have  fallen.  More  recently,  the  value  of  external  earnings \ndenominated in US dollars have declined significantly with exchange rate movements, and \nTuvalu faces steep inflation pushed by rising fuel and food prices.  \n \n4.  Tuvalu is now under unsustainable fiscal pressure. In response, the Government has \nadopted  a  set  of  five  fiscal  performance  benchmark  indicators  (PBIs),  which  track  the \nachievement of desired social outcomes with a focus on improved financial management and \nfiscal consolidation (Appendix 2). These indicators, developed in close cooperation with key \ndevelopment partners, state specific, measurable, and annually updated requirements for a \nbalanced budget, consolidated investment fund minimum balance, debt liability, and expenditure \non basic education and primary health care. The Government is aware that broad reforms are \nneeded to meet the PBIs.  \n \n5.  One indication of commitment to meeting the targets was the Government\u2019s repayment \nin May 2008 of A$1 million to the outer islands agency suspense account overdraft with the \nNational Bank of Tuvalu.5 Other positive actions include taxation reform commenced with the \nsupport of ADB, the legal changes for which Parliament is expected to approve in November \n2008. The Public Accounts Committee has been reinvigorated to provide greater oversight and \naccountability for public financial management and, in July 2008, considered the 2006 audited \naccounts of all public corporations.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Government of Tuvalu. 2005. Te Kakeega II: National Strategy for Sustainable Development 2005\u20132015. Funafuti. \n2  ADB. 2007. Tuvalu 2006 Economic Report: From Plan to Action. Manila.  \n3  The  mission  was  joined  by  John  Vaught,  financial  sector  supervision  advisor,  Pacific  Financial  Technical \nAssistance Centre. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 July 2008. \n5  The overdraft was generated under a system, no longer in use, whereby the Government acted as an agency for \nthe National Bank of Tuvalu, transferring funds deposited in the outer islands to the outer islands agency suspense \naccount. These funds were misdirected into general government revenue, causing the overdraft. \n ", "2   \n6.  The Government owns 11 public enterprises operating in key sectors of the economy.6 \nPolicy, legal, and regulatory frameworks are lacking, including a broader policy on enterprise \nownership  that  would  clarify  the  Government\u2019s  role  and  expectations.  Decisions  regarding \nenterprises made outside of any guiding framework risk being haphazard, uncoordinated, and \nconflicting. Each enterprise is governed by an individual act of incorporation, which provides \nlittle leverage for Government oversight. In practice, performance demands are not placed on \nenterprises. The concept of government-funded community service obligations has not yet been \nadopted. The subsidies paid are not clearly identified in budget papers, and responsibility for the \ncorporations is spread across six ministries.  \n \n7.  Debt is high across all enterprises, with several operating on overdraft. Several have \ngoing concern issues. Most prepare no accounts, financial statements, or annual reports.7 \nBoard members do not always have either a clear understanding of their role or sufficient \ninformation  with  which  to  contribute  meaningfully  to  management.  The  expectation  in \ncorporations is that the Government will bail them out rather than discontinue their services.  \n \n8.  A number of government businesses are embedded in individual ministries.8 They do \nnot produce financial and management reports with which to assess their revenue-earning \npotential.  Synergies  could  be  attained  by  subjecting  these  business  activities  to  review \nregarding profitability and continued government ownership, management, and control. \n \n9.  Meeting  the  PBIs  will  require  the  Government  to  address,  in  addition  to  the  weak \nperformance of public corporations and government business enterprises, the findings of the \npublic financial management system assessment carried out in 2007. It must do so using the \nframework for measuring public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) performance.9 \nPerformance was assessed across six dimensions relating to budgetary achievement based on \noverall fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, and efficiency of service delivery. The \nreview  concluded  that  ratings  on  all  key  indicators  were  low  and  that  the  lack  of  budget \ncredibility, caused by weak budgetary control and poor in-year budget reporting, has hindered \nthe efficient delivery of public services. To meet the PBIs, the Government needs to reach \nagreement on the necessary areas for capacity development in response to the PEFA report, \ntheir sequential order, and a monitoring framework to measure the impact of the individual \ninterventions.  \n \n10.  Despite capacity weaknesses, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP) \nhas made significant efforts to improve the budget process. This has been facilitated by the \nfunding of a budget advisor by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) \nsince 2006 and various ADB TA. The Government has committed to, but not yet accomplished, \ndeveloping a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF), which would guide government decisions \nregarding sustainable expenditure priorities, debt management, and appropriate strategies for \ngenerating revenue.  \n                                                 \n6  These are the National Bank of Tuvalu, National Provident Fund, Development Bank, Tuvalu Telecommunications \nCorporation,  Vaiaku  Lagi  Hotel,  Tuvalu  Electricity  Corporation,  Maritime  Training  Institute,  Tuvalu  Media \nCorporation,  Copra  Trading  Corporation,  Fishing  Corporation,  and  Philatelic  Bureau.  The  Tuvalu  Media \nCorporation has recently been decorporatized, which has involved simply stripping the corporation of its act and \ntaking back full responsibility, including debt, while allowing staff to transfer back to the Government under salaries \nand conditions that exceed those of their counterparts, despite the corporation\u2019s failure. \n7  Government of Tuvalu. 2008.

Lessons from previous ADB assistance to improve financial management in the Pacific \npoint to the importance of not creating dependency on external consultants and to the need to \nstrengthen  the  focus  on  capacity  development.  These  lessons  have  been  incorporated  by \nincluding a capacity-development specialist and by providing consultant input only intermittently, \nto reduce the likelihood of consultants\u2019 being drawn in line work but still providing assistance as \nnecessary. The small number of senior government staff and the relatively limited skills in areas \nrelated to this TA create risks in terms of capacity for sustained commitment. These risks will be \nmitigated by incentives in the proposed program grant and several TA design features: (i) close \nand  ongoing  management  of  the  TA  with  significant  in-country  presence;  (ii)  a  3-year \nimplementation period to allow a focus on long-term capacity building; (iii) development partner \ncoordination mechanisms maintained throughout from TA design, particularly with the Pacific \nFinancial Technical Assistance Centre, and the AusAID-funded budget advisor.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The intended impact of the TA is sustained economic growth and fiscal stability, as \nprioritized in Te Kakeega II. The expected outcome is improved Government fiscal planning and \nmanagement  capacity.  The  achievement  of  the  expected  outcome  will  be  reflected  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity to achieve the policy, legislative, and institutional changes to which it \nhas committed under the proposed grant for Improved Financial Management Program.10 The \nTA will go further by improving the management of finances and Government enterprises while \nconsidering issues of strategy and ownership.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA takes both a top\u2013down and a bottom\u2013up approach. It will develop an MTFF and \ncreate the policy and legislative environment for improving the performance of public enterprises. \nIt will simultaneously work with enterprises to put in place management and planning tools to \nhelp them understand and improve their performance and enable the Government and its \nenterprises to monitor and manage performance. The TA will provide capacity building and \nsupport through the four components. \n \n1.  Component 1: Management Services  \n \n14.  The TA will be supported by augmented management services from the consultant firm, \nproviding ongoing management, liaison, and mentoring, as well as the coordination of inputs, to \nensure  that  inputs  are  directed  toward  the  agreed  objectives  rather  than  fragmented.  The \nexpected output will be effective capacity building and management of public enterprise reforms.  \n \n15.  The main activities will be to (i) support the establishment of a mechanism through which \nthe Government can better manage enterprise monitoring, including a steering committee and a \npublic enterprise unit; (ii) develop an overall strategy and implementation plan for the TA; (iii) \ncoordinate all TA inputs including coordination with other externally-funded activities; (iv) help \nthe Government review lessons in enterprise ownership and management and facilitate their \napplication; (vi) promote positive and productive relationships with the Government, enterprises, \ndevelopment  partners,  and  ADB;  and  (vii)  provide  quarterly  and  annual  monitoring  of  TA \nprogress and associated reporting. \n                                                 \n10 ADB.

This component will provide stronger and more coherent oversight of fiscal and public \nenterprise performance. The main activities will be to (i) help MFEP develop and implement an \nMTFF; (ii) provide training for staff of the public enterprise unit on its role; (iii) develop and \nimplement a strategic policy on public enterprise governance reform, outlining the Government\u2019s \nposition  on  enterprise  ownership  and  options  for  divestment;  (iv) prepare  the  Public \nCorporations Act as overarching legislation that sets out Government monitoring requirements \nand  management  and  reporting  requirements  for  all  enterprises;  (v) develop  a  regulatory \nframework for monitoring enterprises and a legal framework for both establishing and divesting \nenterprises; (vi) coordinate with the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre regarding \nassistance to develop a financial institutions bill; and (vii) assess the tariffs required for the \nfinancial  sustainability  of  the  Tuvalu  Electricity  Corporation  (TEC)  and  the  Tuvalu \nTelecommunications Corporation (TTC) and provide options for how the financial requirements \nof these public enterprises can be balanced with the community services required of them by \nthe Government.  \n \n3.  Component 3: Results-Based Planning and Management Assistance for \nEnterprise Performance Improvement \n \n17.  The  output  of  this  component  will  be  strengthened  management  capacity  in  public \nenterprises. The main activities will be to (i) work with general managers and boards of directors \nto develop and implement a corporate plan and an action plan for each enterprise, based on the \nGovernment\u2019s overarching public enterprise strategic policy and plan, and to help them meet the \nrequirements  of  the  Public  Corporations  Act;  (ii)  improve  accounting  and  management  by \nintroducing basic accounting skills and disciplines to allow standardized and timely accounts to \nbe submitted to boards and then to the public enterprise unit; (iii) provide assistance to support \nspecific National Bank of Tuvalu policy and practice changes to improve performance; (iv) \ndevelop job descriptions for use in all enterprises, together with a performance appraisal format; \nand (v) support the Government\u2019s assessment of the private sector development potential in \nTuvalu as a basis for decisions on appropriate private sector involvement in public enterprises.  \n \n4.  Component 4: Capacity Building \n \n18.  This component will strengthen the capacity in MFEP and public enterprises to provide \nsustainable fiscal management, planning and monitoring, and public enterprise monitoring and \nmanagement. The main activities are (i) a diagnostic analysis of MFEP capacity, building on the \nresults of the 2007 PEFA review, and developing a framework to measure planned interventions \nto remedy budgeting and financial management problems (to be financed by the Government of \nAustralia);  (ii)  formal  training,  informal  on-the-job  development  and  learning  by  doing,  and \nmentoring for MFEP, the public enterprise unit, boards, and general managers; and (iii) raising \npublic and stakeholder awareness undertaken in regard to specific issues.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $982,750, of which $57,750 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Government of Australia11 and administered by ADB, and $800,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government of Tuvalu will finance $125,000 \n                                                 \n11 Through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) between the \nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Asian Development Bank. \n ", "  5\nequivalent by providing office space and facilities, legal services, counterpart staff, support \nservices, and office supplies. Details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  MFEP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  will,  with  TA  support,  establish  a  public \nenterprise unit comprising two professional staff and a secretary. This unit will be the focal point \nfor  TA  and  remain  as  the  interface  between  enterprises  and  the  Government  after  TA \ncompletion. The secretary for finance will provide guidance for TA implementation with the \nsupport of a steering committee comprising government representatives.  \n \n21.  The TA will finance 25.5 person-months of intermittent international consulting and 8 \nperson-months of national consulting services. ADB will recruit a firm based on a simplified \ntechnical proposal under the quality- and cost-based selection process, using 80:20 weighting \nfor quality and cost. The consultant team will have a (i) team leader and advisor on institutional \nstrengthening  and  public  enterprise  development  (international,  12  person-months);  (ii) \nspecialist in developing public financial management capacity (international, 2.5 person-months); \n(iii) public financial management advisor (international, 8 person-months), (iv) planning and \nhuman resource development advisor (international, 3 person-months), and (v) project facilitator \n(national, 8 person-months). International advisors will be very senior technical specialists in \ntheir field, with extensive experience in small island states, as well as skilled trainers committed \nto capacity building. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n22.  TA implementation will be supported with augmented management services from a \nproject manager working approximately 3 person-months and provided by the firm for a lump \nsum.  The  management  and  administrative  input  of  the  project  manager  will  be  provided \nintermittently  but  according  to  an  agreed  plan  throughout  TA  implementation.  The  project \nmanager will be responsible for developing the detailed terms of reference for the three long-\nterm advisors and the national consultant. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented intermittently, starting in December 2008 and ending in \nDecember 2011. TA implementation will commence with a diagnostic analysis of MFEP capacity. \nThe implementation of remaining activities will commence with an inception report prepared for \nADB and the Government by the team leader within 4 weeks of the start of field activities, which \nwill include an overall work plan for the full period and a detailed work plan for the first year. \nBrief quarterly progress reports will be prepared in consultation with the public enterprise unit \nand provided to ADB. Semiannual progress reports will be submitted throughout the TA and a \ndraft final report submitted by 30 October 2011. The final report will be submitted within a month \nof the incorporation of ADB and Government comments on the draft final report. The outcomes \nof the diagnostic analysis will be the subject of a separate report. ADB will help the Government \nshare all reports with other development partners.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $57,750 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance of \n$800,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Tuvalu for Capacity Development for Public \nFinancial Management, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  And Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \n  Meeting of annual targets  Budget papers  \u2022  Government maintains its \nSustained economic  agreed with development    commitment to the PBIs. \ngrowth and fiscal  partners for performance  Tuvalu Trust Fund  \u2022  Economy will sustain \nstability   benchmark indicators  Advisory Committee  continued demand for \n  (PBIs) relating to budget  reports   current or greater levels of \nbalance, debt level,    service. \nprimary education, and     \nbasic health-care  Risks \nexpenditure   \u2022  Lengthy lag before \n  improvement in fiscal \nachievements \n\u2022  Economy not sufficiently \nbuoyant to enable \nsignificant private sector \ngrowth \nOutcomes      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Continued government \nImproved government  Annual budget aligned  Fiscal year (FY) 2010  commitment to reforms at \nfiscal planning and  with medium-term fiscal  budget papers  the political bureaucratic \nmanagement capacity  objectives    level \n    Medium-term fiscal  \u2022  Continuing assistance \nMonitoring of government  framework (MTFF)  from the public enterprise \nfinancial support to public    unit and good advice \nenterprises  Public enterprise   \n  management and  Risks \nPublic enterprises in  performance reports   \u2022  Limited capacity of the \ncompliance with all    public enterprise unit to \naspects of the Public  Auditor\u2019s reports   monitor and ensure \nCorporations Act    compliance  \n  Quarterly TA reports  \u2022  Expenditures inconsistent \nImprovements in key    with budgets \nfinancial indicators for  Program grant \n\u2022  Steering committee fails to \npublic enterprises  monitoring reports \nmeet or fails to provide \n   \neffective oversight. \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Staff commitment to \nComponent 1  Public enterprises unit    understanding and \n\u2022  Effective  and steering committee  TA quarterly reports   applying capacity-building \nmanagement of  established    input \npublic enterprise       \nreforms   TA implementation  TA quarterly reports   Risks \n  progresses according to    \u2022  Staff changes compromise \n  work plan    continuity and quality of \n      planning \nComponent 2      \u2022  Skilled senior staff already \n\u2022  Strengthened and  MTFF developed and  MTFF  have high workloads \ncoherent oversight of  included in budget    \u2022  Government proves \nfiscal performance  documents  Budget papers  unwilling to introduce or \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  And Risks  \nMechanisms  \nand public enterprise      fund community service \nperformance  Public enterprise  Cabinet minutes  obligations. \n  governance reform    \u2022  Government fails to follow \n  strategic policy endorsed    direction set by MTFF in its \n  by the cabinet by June    budgets. \n  2009  Parliamentary reporting   \n     \n  Public Corporations Act   \n  approved by Parliament   \n  by October 2009  TA quarterly reports  \n     \n  Enterprise monitoring   \n  framework utilized by   \n  public enterprise unit from  TTC and TEC reports \n  June 2009   \n    Budget documents \n  Implementation of   \n  recommendations on   \n  Tuvalu   \n  Telecommunications   \n  Corporation (TTC) and   \n  Tuvalu Electricity   \n  Corporation (TEC) tariffs   \n  and scale of community  Corporate plans \n  service obligations from   \n  September 2009   \n     \nComponent 3  Corporate plan and action   \n\u2022  Strengthened  plan for each public  TA quarterly reports  \nmanagement  enterprise developed and   \ncapacity in public  annually updated   \nenterprises     \n  Progress against   \n  corporate plan targets  FY2010 budget papers \n  reported to the board   \n  annually for each public \n  enterprises \n   \nComponent 4  Systems in place and \n\u2022  Diagnostic analysis  being used for more \nreport  effective fiscal \n\u2022  Strengthened  management, planning, \ncapacity in MFEP   and monitoring \n   \n \n ", "8  Appendix 1 \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n  \u2022  ADB $800,000 \nComponent 1:  \u2022  ADB supervision and \n1.1 Develop a TA implementation plan.  administration by the \n1.2 Support establishment of a public enterprise unit and steering committee.

The Government of Tuvalu (the Government) has adopted a set of five performance \nbenchmark indicators (PBIs) developed jointly by it, the Asian Development Bank, the Australian \nAgency for International Development, and New Zealand International Aid and Development. \nThe  PBIs  track  the  achievement  of  the  stated  social  outcomes  with  a  focus  on  improved \nfinancial management and fiscal consolidation. The PBIs are as follows: \n(i)  Benchmark 1.1. The Government\u2019s recurrent expenditure each year should not \nexceed the total of its recurrent revenue plus a sustainable Tuvalu Trust Fund \n(TTF) distribution (consolidated investment fund drawdown).  \n(ii)  Benchmark 1.2. The target minimum value of funds retained in the consolidated \ninvestment fund should not be less than 16% of the maintained value of the TTF \nat  the  beginning  of  the  TTF  year,  to  ensure  that  sustainable  distribution  is \navailable to help finance annual budgets.  \n(iii)  Benchmark  1.3.  The  Government\u2019s  total  debt  liability,  both  domestic  and \nexternal, should not at any time exceed 60% of the gross domestic product, as \nspecified in Te Kakeega II. \n(iv)  Benchmark 2.1. In 2008, the Government will increase its budgeted non-salary \nexpenditure on basic education by at least 5%. \n(v)  Benchmark 2.2. In 2008, the Government will increase its budgeted non-salary \nexpenditure on primary and preventative health services by at least 5%. \n \n2.  The PBIs are updated annually, as required in consultation with development partners, \nto reflect broader fiscal conditions and affordability. More specifically, benchmarks 2.1 and 2.2 \nset clear targets for a specific year (the 5% targets for 2008 being the first such annual targets) \nwith the intent that they be reset annually in consultation with development partners. It is notable \nthat monitoring Tuvalu\u2019s performance against benchmark 2.1 (education), compared with the \n2007 budget outturn, showed the proportion of the education budget spent on primary education \nand  vocational  training,  excluding  salaries,  allowances,  and  scholarships,  had  increased \nsignificantly to 15.0%, more than double the 7.1% allocated in 2006. For benchmark 2.2, the \nproportion of the health budget spent on primary and preventative health care increased slightly \nin 2007 to 18.1% from 17.7% in 2006. The evolving nature of these last two PBIs allows \nappropriate  and  agreed  adjustments  to  be  made  to  the  targets,  which  ensures  that  they \ncontinue to promote fiscally responsible action supportive of social objectives. \n \n3.  Fiscal performance against the PBIs is monitored by the Government through the Tuvalu \nTrust Fund Advisory Committee (TTFAC), which ensures impartiality, and is watched closely by \nthe Government and development partners. Assessment in April 2008 by the TTFAC, compared \nwith the 2007 budget outturn, found that the Government had met benchmarks 1.3, 2.1, and 2.2. \nAgainst benchmark 1.1, the TTFAC found that the recurrent budget, when added to the grants \nbalance  outturn  for  2007,  was  a  deficit  of  A$2.06  million,  which  was  then  reduced  to  a \nA$1.04 million deficit after deducting the Government\u2019s A$1.02 million contribution to the TTF. \nAs  such,  the  2007  budget  outturn  did  not  meet  benchmark  1.1.  The  TTFAC  stated  that \nbenchmark 1.1 was arguably the most important benchmark. TTFAC further noted regarding \nbenchmark 1.2 that there was a marked improvement in Government efforts to achieve the \ntarget minimum balance.  \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nA.

Does it \nknow who its priority clients are in the first place?  \n(b)  Are  these  expectations  reflected  in  its  key  results  areas  and  annual \ntargets that it sets for itself periodically? \n(c)  Are its annual targets reduced to a select number of clear, monitorable, \nand achievable targets that are regularly updated? \n(d)  Does it monitor and assess its performance regularly? Is this monitoring \nand assessment built into its ongoing performance management systems?  \n(e)  What are its current key performance gaps? These gaps have causes \nthat can be found in one or more of the four areas described by the points \nbelow. The diagnostic needs to work back from these performance gaps \nto find the root causes of underperformance. Then the capacity-building \nexercise can be better targeted. \n(f)  Has budget credibility been established? To what degree has post-PEFA \ndevelopment work progressed? What remains to be done? \n(ii)   Availability of resources \n(a)  Analysis  of  the  answers  to  the  questions  above  will  reveal  key \nperformance gaps. Is inadequacy of budget, staff numbers and skills, or \nassets responsible for these gaps?  \n(b)  Is there proportionality between expected results and available resources?   \n(c)  Do results need to be pared down to fit the resources available? \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2007.

Is  there  a  clear  strategy  to \nmobilize their support?  \n(b)  Which stakeholders are constraining the achievement of results? Why? \nHow can they be persuaded to become collaborators?  \n(v)  Leadership \n(a)  Does the leadership promote key values that improve performance? \n(b)  Does it lead by example?  \n(c)  Does it provide clear direction to staff?  \n(d)  Does it show commitment to meeting clients\u2019 needs and achieving results?  \n \n15.
