INTRODUCTION \n \n1.   The strengthening and use of country systems is widely recognized as a means to improve \naid effectiveness. Toward this end, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) pursues the use of \ncountry safeguard systems (CSS) as stipulated in the Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) (2009). \nThe proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen CSS by facilitating \ntheir application, in lieu of ADB safeguard requirements, to identify and manage the environmental \nand social risks associated with ADB-supported projects. This will be achieved through the \nconduct of CSS assessments and capacity-building activities following the CSS assessment \nmethodology.1 The TA will help realize the benefits of using CSS, which take the form of: (i) \nreducing transaction costs involved in project compliance with safeguards; (ii) strengthening the \nownership of borrowers and clients of environmental and social safeguards; and (iii) harmonizing \nsafeguard policies among donors.2 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Management-approved 2017 work program of the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department (SDCC), and is an endorsed corporate priority \nTA.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The SPS emphasizes a phased and demand-driven approach to the use of CSS. The \ndemand has, however, been lower than the SPS Medium-Term Action Plan (2010\u20132012) had \nenvisioned. According to the action plan, ADB was to support the use of CSS in 3\u20135 developing \nmember countries (DMCs) (SPS, attachment 1, p. 89). To date, only two DMCs have requested \nADB to consider such use: (i) the Government of Indonesia requested the use of its CSS for \nenvironment and involuntary resettlement safeguards in selected priority sectors, as a result of \nwhich the work toward use of a CSS is under way; and (ii) ADB has approved the use of CSS at \nthe agency level for the Power Grid Corporation of India, and is also in the process of completing \nthe national CSS assessment. \n \n4.  The SPS requires ADB to undertake the following, prior to use of CSS: (i) an equivalence \nassessment4 of the DMC policy framework for environment, involuntary resettlement, and/or \nIndigenous Peoples safeguards; and (ii) an acceptability assessment5 of the DMC capacity and \ntrack record in implementing its own policies and requirements. The CSS assessment process \nalso requires ADB to conduct stakeholder consultations on the findings of the assessments, and \nto collaborate with other development partners. Constraints that have so far hampered a more \nexpeditious implementation of the SPS provisions on the use of CSS include the considerable \ncost of conducting equivalence and acceptability assessments, and the limited technical expertise \nin applying the CSS assessment methodology as specified in the SPS.  \n \n                                                \n1  The SPS prescribes a format and methodology for undertaking equivalence and acceptability assessments (SPS, \nparas. 68\u201369 and Appendix 6). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 June 2017. \n3  ADB. 2016. 2017 Corporate Priority TA Program\u2014Summary of Decisions from the Heads of Departments Meeting. \nMemorandum. 22 November (internal).  \n4  A CSS is equivalent to the ADB SPS if the CSS is designed to achieve the objectives and adheres to the policy \nscope, triggers, and applicable principles set out in the SPS (SPS, para. 68[ii] and Appendix 6, para. 10; see also \nADB. 2010. Draft Guidance Note for Review of Country Safeguard Systems. Manila. para. 10).  \n5  Acceptability refers to the extent to which the borrower has the acceptable implementation practice, track record, \ncapacity, and commitment to implement the applicable laws, regulations, rules, and procedures in the country, or \nspecific sector or agency concerned (SPS, para. 68[ii] and Appendix 6, para. 10; see also ADB. 2010. Draft Guidance \nNote for Review of Country Safeguard Systems. Manila. para. 16).  \n ", "2 \n5.  Once the equivalence and capacity assessments have been completed, and if the CSS is \nfound to be broadly aligned with the SPS, a gap-filling action plan will be prepared to ensure CSS \noutcomes are fully in line with SPS requirements. It is noteworthy, in this context, that adoption \nby  India  and  Indonesia  of  landmark  legislation  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  has \nencouraged those countries to request ADB to consider the use of CSS. In countries where larger \ngaps in safeguard policies and capacities exist, capacity building will continue and efforts would \nbe made on policy and regulatory reforms.   \n \n6.  The Independent Evaluation Department, in two evaluation studies of the ADB safeguard \npolicy implementation, has recommended to promote the use of CSS through a more strategic \nand  systematic  program  of  action.6 It  also recommended  to  continue  with  ADB\u2019s  cautious \napproach in using CSS. The proposed TA pursues this approach. It will focus on countries with \npromising prospects for a successful application of CSS. In these countries, the TA will support \nthe conduct of equivalence and capacity assessments, including the development of gap-filling \naction  plans,  if  required.  It  will  also  undertake  capacity  building  activities  for  government \ncounterparts, consultants, and in-country stakeholders on the CSS assessment methodology and \nto close wider gaps in other countries. This approach is expected to generate higher demand in \nthese DMCs for use of CSS in lieu of SPS requirements. \n \n7.  Under the completed TA on Strengthening and Use of Country Safeguard Systems,7 ADB \nundertook some groundwork which will support the activities of the proposed TA. ADB initiated \nan exercise to map CSS across Asia and the Pacific in August 2014 under this TA. The objective \nof the CSS regional mapping exercise is to facilitate the strengthening and use of CSS by \nidentifying areas of convergence between DMC policy frameworks and the SPS. The TA has \ncompleted  this  reconnaissance-level  mapping  on  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement \nsafeguards in all 40 borrowing DMCs, and for Indigenous Peoples safeguards in 22 DMCs. The \nproposed TA will update the preliminary assessments, as appropriate, to consider relevant \nchanges in legislation, and will also complete the mapping on Indigenous Peoples safeguards. \n \n8.  A regional overview of the completed matrices from preliminary mapping shows that there \nare policy frameworks in DMCs in all three safeguard areas. Some of the frameworks are closer \nto the SPS than others as they include legal instruments that can be considered fully or partially \nequivalent to SPS policy principles. For environmental safeguards, Bhutan, the Philippines, and \nKazakhstan have either full or partial equivalence in all 11 environmental policy principles (SPS, \np.16). The common equivalence gaps among DMCs are in principle relating to examining project \nalternatives,  cumulative  and  strategic  assessments,  and  disclosure  of  environmental \nassessments. For involuntary resettlement safeguards, India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka have \neither full or partial equivalence in all 12 involuntary resettlement policy principles (SPS, p.17). \nCommon gaps in the involuntary resettlement policy framework  relate to nontitled affected \npersons; preparation, disclosure, and monitoring of resettlement plans; and improving or restoring \nthe livelihood of displaced persons. For Indigenous Peoples safeguards, the Philippines policy \nframework is closest to the nine policy principles of the SPS (SPS, p.18) because of the landmark \n1997 Indigenous Peoples Rights Act. For most other DMCs, the common gaps in Indigenous \nPeoples safeguards relate to identification of Indigenous Peoples, consultation and consent \nduring project planning and implementation, and provisions for culturally appropriate benefits and \nmitigation measures. \n                                                \n6  Independent Evaluation Department. 2014.

The preliminary, reconnaissance-level safeguard equivalent matrices, together with the \nlegal instruments upon which each assessment is based, have been made available for comment \nto internal and external stakeholders via a CSS web portal.8 These assessments will help in \nidentifying countries with better prospects for using CSS and identifying major gaps in countries \nto focus on reforms, and serve as initial data for rigorous CSS assessments when a country \nrequests the  use  of  CSS. Thus,  the  proposed TA  will  build  on the  outputs  of the TA  on \nStrengthening and Use of Country Safeguard Systems.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  Based on the design and monitoring framework, the TA is aligned with the following \nimpact: environmental and social sustainability of development projects enhanced. The TA will \nhave the following outcome: use of CSS in ADB operations supported.9  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n \n11.  Output 1: Equivalence and acceptability assessments conducted. For each DMC or \nagency that requests the use of CSS, the TA will support the equivalence assessment of the \nexisting policy and regulatory framework, and the acceptability assessment of the agencies \ninvolved. Based on the assessment recommendations, a gap-filling action plan will be drafted, \ndiscussed, and endorsed by the relevant government institution, and then finalized. Using the \nassessments and action plan as the basis of due diligence, ensuing projects in the DMC may then \nadopt the use of CSS in lieu of SPS requirements as the benchmark for safeguards. ADB will \nsupport in-country stakeholder consultations on the assessments and action plan. Under output \n1, the TA will also update preliminary CSS assessment, as needed. \n \n12.  Output 2: Capacity development activities on use and strengthening of country \nsafeguard systems undertaken. The TA will support training workshops on the conduct of \nequivalence and acceptability assessments. ADB will train staff of DMC government agencies, \nexperts from academe, and consultants on the methodology to assess policy equivalence and \nimplementation capacity using the guidance note for country safeguard review.   \n \n13.  Output 3: Interagency collaboration on country safeguard systems strengthened. \nThe  TA  will  support  collaboration  among  development  partners  to  achieve  harmonized \napproaches to the use of CSS in lieu of financiers\u2019 requirements. Among others, one of the bases \nfor this collaboration is the principles of collaboration on country safeguard systems signed by \nADB, the World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and Department of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade (Australia) in May 2016. To support the collaboration agreement, the TA will \nprepare  and  disseminate  knowledge  products  on  best  practices  in  country  safeguard \nassessments, and use and strengthening of CSS.10 The TA will conduct a CSS regional workshop \nfor knowledge exchange between development partners and DMCs. The TA also will support \ntraining workshops on environmental and social impact assessment through the safeguard \n                                                \n8  CSS web portal: http://countrysafeguardsystems.net/ \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n10 Digital publication will be preferred; however, printed publications will be made available on demand. \n ", "4 \nlearning centers that have been established by the development partners, including in the \nPhilippines and Viet Nam.11   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2.     \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. SDCC will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; \nprepare knowledge products; organize workshops; and provide resources for staff to act as the \nresource persons in workshops. In conducting equivalence and acceptability assessments, SDCC \nand the relevant operations department will form country assessment teams composed of staff \nfrom ADB Headquarters and resident missions. Based on the results of the CSS mapping \nexercise under the TA on Strengthening and Use of Country Safeguard Systems, the potential \ncandidates  for  equivalence  and  acceptability  assessments  include  Fiji,  the  Philippines,  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, and Sri Lanka. The selection of DMCs and/or agencies to be \nsupported under the TA will be on a first-come, first-served basis, since CSS assessments are \nconducted on a demand-driven basis (SPS, para. 77). SDCC has undertaken consultation \nmeetings with the East Asia Department, Southeast Asia Department, South Asia Department, \nand Pacific Department staff on the potential for CSS assessment in the candidate countries. \nBased on a request from the Government of Sri Lanka, SDCC and the South Asia Department \nfielded a joint consultation mission to Sri Lanka to explain SPS provisions on use of CSS. To \naccess TA funds under output 1, operations departments will formally express interest to SDCC \nthat a specific DMC has requested ADB to consider the use of CSS.  No funds will be disbursed \nuntil ADB obtains a no-objection letter from the DMC government concerned. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  August 2017\u2013July 2019  \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nImplementing agencies  Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department and \noperational departments \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual selection  16 person-months  $299,200 \n(international)   (intermittent) \nIndividual selection  24 person-months  $132,000 \n(national)   (continuous) \nIndividual selection  38 person-months  $123,200 \n(national)   (intermittent) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \nSource: Asian Development Bank  \n \n16.
