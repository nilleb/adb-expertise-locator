INTRODUCTION \n1.  In December 2009, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) \nto improve provider payment methods for rural health insurance. ADB undertook TA fact-finding \nin  March  2010  and  reached  agreement  with  the  government  regarding  the  TA's  impact, \noutcome, outputs, terms of reference for consulting services, cost estimates, financing plan, and \nimplementation arrangements.1 The TA is in line with Strategy 20202 and the Operational Plan \nfor Health3 under Strategy 2020.The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  In 2003, the PRC launched the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS), a \nhealth insurance scheme run by counties, to address the high out-of-pocket expenditures for \nhealth care in rural areas. Funding for NRCMS is provided by central and local governments on \na per capita basis (CNY20 in 2003, CNY80 in 2009) and rural residents contribute a fixed \namount on a voluntary basis (CNY10 in 2003, CNY20 in 2009). NRCMS has made great \nprogress; in 2008, it covered 100% of counties, and in 2009, it enrolled 833 million people, \nresulting in an enrollment rate of 94%. NRCMS represents a major step toward a rural health \nfinancing system that is more equitable, through reducing out-of-pocket expenditures for health \ncare, and also more efficient.  \n \n3.  The level of financial protection provided by NRCMS has risen along with increases in \nthe funding available for NRCMS, with the true reimbursement rate4 increasing from 25% in \n2004 to 41% in 2009. However, rising medical costs are reducing the financial protection of the \ninsured,  especially  when  patients  suffer  from  catastrophic  illnesses.  Furthermore,  NRCMS \nreimburses primarily in-patient care, thereby creating an incentive to shift from low-cost out-\npatient to costly in-patient care.  \n \n4.  In the PRC, providers are paid primarily on a fee-for-service basis, which encourages \nexcessive and expensive treatments. Providers have a tendency to increase their income by \nselling drugs and providing high-tech care. The additional funding available to health providers \nexerts an upward pressure on the cost of care without necessarily improving the quality of \nservices. The 2009 Health System Reform in the PRC requires NRCMS to become more \nefficient in reducing the economic burden of illnesses for rural residents. A recent decision of the \ngovernment requires at least 10% of counties to reform their provider payment methods under \nNRCMS by the end of 2010. \n \n5.  Although some counties have piloted different payment methods, there is no systematic \napproach in reforming payment mechanisms to providers. The TA will provide international \nexperience  on  provider  payment  methods,  summarize  the  overall  experience  of  provider \npayment methods used by NRCMS, observe the implementation of a number of typical payment \nmethods, document the successful experiences of counties that have carried out payment \nmethod reforms, and pilot selected payment methods. The TA will explore provider payment \nmethods suitable for rural areas, which could be widely used by NRCMS after validation to \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 March 2010. \n2  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n4  The  true  reimbursement  rate  deducts  deductibles,  ceilings,  and  related  expenses  before  computing  the \nreimbursement rate. \n ", "2   \nbetter control the cost of care, ensure the quality of health services, and minimize transaction \ncosts. This would entail improving the way in which NRCMS purchases health services from \nhospitals on behalf of their members, including capacity building to improve contracting and \nnegotiating skills, and improving monitoring of the quality of the services provided. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA aims to identify appropriate health provider payment methods to strengthen the \nhealth services purchasing capacity of NRCMS. The outcome of the TA will be for MOH to \nadopt policy recommendations on reforming provider payment methods for NRCMS. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 2. \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  Key outputs. The TA will deliver three outputs: (i) a study report on international and \nnational experience, (ii) capacity-building material on payment methods, and (iii) dissemination \nof findings and recommendations. \n \n8.  Output  1:  Study  report  on  international  and  national  experience.  To  prepare \nrecommendations for NRCMS on provider payment reform, the TA will (i) identify international \nexperience and best practices in provider payment methods, especially for rural and remote \nareas; (ii) analyze the provider payment methods currently used under NRCMS; (iii) carry out \nselected field investigations in several counties considered of particular interest for the future \nreform of provider payment methods; (iv) draw lessons from pilot tests to be conducted in two \ncounties; and (v) prepare a study report on NRCMS provider payment reform and international \nexperience based on the results of items (i) \u2013 (iv).  \n \n9.  Output 2: Capacity-building material on payment methods for health providers, \nNRCMS managers, and health authorities. The TA will (i) prepare and pilot test training \nmaterials based on the findings and recommendations of output 1; (ii) train selected health \nproviders, NRCMS managers, and health authorities; and (iii) organize an overseas trip on \nprovider payment methods for key decision-makers and implementers. \n \n10.  Output 3: Dissemination of findings and recommendations. Dissemination of results, \nwhich is essential to the success of the TA, will be carried out through (i) three multisectoral \nworkshops for policy makers and key implementers; (ii) preparation of policy recommendations \nfor MOH on reforming provider payment  methods; (iii) a final dissemination conference to \npresent the TA's findings and recommendations to MOH and other relevant decision-makers \nand stakeholders at the national and local levels; and (iv) preparation of a knowledge product on \nprovider payment methods for NRCMS, targeting decision-makers and technical staff.  \n \n11.  The  TA  consultants  will  report  regularly  to  the  project  steering  committee  on  the \nprogress  of  activities  under  outputs  1\u20133  and  fine-tune  final  recommendations  to  MOH  for \nreforming provider payment methods.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "  3\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $380,000 equivalent.  The government has \nrequested ADB to finance $300,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-Other  Sources).  The  TA  will  finance \nconsulting services, including (i) external resource persons for draft reviews and other focused \ninputs;  (ii)  a  conference,  workshops,  and  training;  (iii)  domestic  and  overseas  travel;  and  \n(iv) field work and survey costs. The government will finance the balance of the cost, equivalent \nto $80,000, through provision of office space and equipment (computers), communications \nfacilities for consultants, remuneration and per diem for counterpart staff, and other in-kind \ncontributions.  Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 22 months from October 2010 to July 2012, with policy \nrecommendations adopted by MOH shortly after July 2012.  \n \n14.  The Department of Rural Health Management (DRHM), MOH will be the executing \nagency for the TA, and the Center for the Cooperative Medical Scheme (CCMS), MOH will be \nthe implementing agency. DRHM and CCMS will each designate a senior staff member as the \nTA  focal  point,  and  will  facilitate  the  consultants\u2019  access  to  participating  central  and  local \ngovernment agencies, as well as to materials, data, and documents required by the TA. CCMS \nwill provide a furnished office with utilities and telecommunication access for the consultants \nand arrange the logistics for the field trips. \n \n15.  Under the supervision of DRHM, CCMS will be responsible for day-to-day oversight and \nsupport  of  the  consultants\u2019  work.  The  study  report  (output  1)  and  TA  findings  and \nrecommendations (output 3) will be distributed to key stakeholders for comments to maximize \nthe impact of the TA. \n \n16.  A  project  steering  committee  will  be  set  up,  chaired  by  DRHM  and  composed  of \nrepresentatives from the Department of Social Security, Ministry of Finance (MOF); Department \nof Social Assistance, Ministry of Civil Affairs; Department of Pricing, National Development and \nReform Commission; and Department of Planning and Finance, MOH. The purpose of the \nsteering  committee  is  to  build  broad  support  across  key  agencies  and  disseminate  major \noutputs to relevant ministries and agencies. Coordination will take place with the World Health \nOrganization and the World Bank (who are involved in health financing activities in the PRC) \nthrough informal meetings and participation in the three workshops to discuss provider payment \nmechanisms. \n \n17.  In dialogue with DRHM, ADB will engage national consultants for a total of 12 person-\nmonths. ADB will recruit the consultants on an individual basis to ensure their timely fielding and \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time \nto time). The consultants will be chosen based on their academic qualifications and relevant \nwork experience. The consultants will include a team leader and senior health economist (6 \nperson-months), a senior policy and evaluation  specialist (4 person-months), and a senior \nhealth financing specialist with strong expertise in survey methodology (2 person-months). The \nconsultants  will  have  strong  expertise  in  health  financing  and  health  insurance  with \nspecialization in provider payment methods, and practical experience with NRCMS. The team \nleader, with the assistance of the other two consultants, will be responsible for producing the \n ", "4   \nTA's outputs and deliverables effectively and on time and for organizing and carrying out all TA \nactivities. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The  consultants,  through  the  CCMS,  will  submit  to  the  government  and  ADB  the \nfollowing four reports, which will be prepared in Chinese and English:  \n \n(i)  an inception report within 1 month of commencement of services for discussion \nduring ADB's inception mission, with an implementation plan, the description of \nthe  division  of  labor  among  consultants  for  the  execution  of  the  TA,  a \ncoordination  mechanism  with  CCMS,  and  an  outline  of  the  study  report  on \nNRCMS provider payment reform and international experience (output 1);  \n \n(ii)  an interim report on the progress made on activities under outputs 1 and 2;  \n \n(iii)  a draft final report, which will include the study report (output 1), the training \nmaterial (output 2), and the knowledge product (output 3); and \n \n(iv)  a final report, which will include the finalized items included in the draft final \nreport and the policy recommendations on reforming provider payment methods \nfor NRCMS.  \n \n19.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate \nimplementation, ADB may establish an advance payment facility for MOH to support certain \nagreed cash expenditures, including workshops, a conference, and the implementation of field \nwork and survey activities, with details of the proposed activities, including cost estimates, being \nsubmitted via DRHM to ADB for approval. ADB may also make certain direct payments (e.g., for \nworkshop venues).  \n \n20.  MOF has proposed to delegate to DRHM the TA administration under the Enhanced \nPartnership on TA Delegation.5 A capacity assessment conducted by ADB's Central Operations \nServices Office has concluded that DRHM has the capacity to administer the TA given that (i) \nthe assignment is small, (ii) only individual consultants will be recruited, and (iii) a staff member \nfrom CCMS has attended a training course on TA delegation that was held in Beijing from 17 to \n21 May 2010.   \n \n21.  Through informal meetings involving ADB staff and MOH officials, the TA will be linked to \nthe health component of the TA for Supporting Fiscal Reforms in High Priority Sectors, which \nwill explore public financing mechanisms to fund township hospitals, community health services, \nand village clinics.6  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Rural  Health  Insurance:  Improving \nProvider Payment Methods, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n5  MOU signed between MOF and ADB in November 2009. \n6  ADB. 2008.
