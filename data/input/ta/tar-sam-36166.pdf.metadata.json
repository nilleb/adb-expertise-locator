Successive governments since then have adopted a cautious \napproach to reforms in priority areas such as financial sector liberalization, improved strategic \nplanning process by the Government and departments, and tariff and tax restructuring. The \nreform program has been assisted by a number of external aid agencies including the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).1 This approach has resulted in successful and sustainable progress \nin a number of areas, particularly public service and revenue reforms. The passage of the Public \nFinance Management Act in September 2001 is another step in the Government\u2019s public sector \nreform agenda to ensure that the public sector financial resources will be allocated to priority \nareas in accordance with the country\u2019s strategic development objectives. \n \n2.  The Act was promulgated in October 2001. The Government arranged for information \nsessions in 2002 to explain to department staff the provisions of the new legislation. During the \n2002  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  requested  ADB  to  provide  technical \nassistance (TA) to implement the Act. The TA was included in the 2003 assistance program.2 \nThe  initial  Fact-Finding  Mission  was  carried  out  during  25\u201327  November  2002.  The  TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In recent years the focus of public sector reforms has been to raise the effectiveness \nand  efficiency  of  the  public  service  through  the  devolution  of  authority  to  line  ministries. \nDevolution has been achieved by refocusing departmental functions, establishing management \nplans that link departmental budgets with its corporate objectives, establishing performance \nmanagement systems for departmental staff, and strengthening the capacity of departments to \ncarry out their refocused core functions. \n \n4.  Consistent  with  the  principles  of  transparency  and  accountability,  the  Government \ninitiated steps to introduce sound management of public finances. The Act provides the legal \nframework to support financial and economic reforms. The principal objective of the Act is to \n\u201cfoster  and  enhance  effective  and  responsible  economic  and  financial  management  by \nGovernment.\u201d This is to be achieved by formulating an economic and fiscal policy supported by \na  medium-term  expenditure  framework  that  conforms  to  the  Government\u2019s  development \nstrategies and priorities. The minister of finance is responsible for the sound management of \npublic finances, supported by the financial secretary as the principal financial adviser to the \nGovernment. The Act makes department heads accountable for the management of financial \nresources appropriated to their departments. \n \n5.  ADB provided assistance to the Department of Treasury in recent years to strengthen \nthe capacity for macroeconomic analysis, planning, and policy formulation.3 The Australian \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

", "2  \nAgency for International Development (AusAID) provided significant assistance to the Treasury \nto strengthen capacity in customs and tax administration, budgeting, and general policy advice \nincluding the drafting of the Act. The Act completes the linkages between the transformation of \nthe public service into a performance-oriented organization and the overall efficient and effective \nmanagement of public finances. The Act formally devolves financial management responsibility \nto department heads to support the implementation of performance-based budget management. \nThis  means  that  departments  will  need  to  manage  their  funds  to  achieve  outputs  and \nperformance measures set out in the annual Appropriations Act. \n \n6.  A  move  from  centralized  financial  management  to  individual  departments  being \nresponsible for their own finances requires careful planning of the transitional procedures as \nwell as the final decentralized arrangement to ensure that control of public financial resources is \nmaintained. As Samoa is a small economy with limited resources, and as accounting, auditing, \ninformation system, and skills for managing change are in short supply, the importance of \ncareful prioritizing and sequencing of implementation activities, and building capacity during and \nafter the transition cannot be overemphasized. \n \n7.  The  management  and  control  of  public  finances  are  critical  for  the  economic \nperformance and social stability of a country like Samoa. Experience in public sector reforms \naround the world has taught that successful reform implementation requires careful planning \nthat takes account of the stage of development of the country concerned, the level of resources \nand skills that are available and will be needed, and the absorptive and management capacity of \npublic officials. Implementing public service administration reforms and financial management \ndevolution in two phases provides a firm foundation for success in Samoa. \n \n8.  The  objectives  of  a  good  public  financial  management  system  are  to  ensure  the \nsoundness of public finances, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of fiscal activities and \npromote  transparency,  accountability,  and  legitimacy  in  government  financial  transactions. \nProperly designed and implemented, a good financial management system will result in a \nbetter-informed public debate about the objectives and results of the Government\u2019s strategic \npolicies  and  financial  management,  and  make  the  government  and  its  institutions  more \naccountable for the use of public financial resources. The Act has laid a firm foundation and \nsuccess will depend on effective implementation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA will support the implementation of the Act and to supplement the Government\u2019s \nown  resources  during  the  early  phases  of  the  implementation  period.  The  Act  covers  all \nelements of public sector financial management, from the medium-term economic and fiscal \nstrategy to budget formulation and execution to accounting and financial reporting to penalty for \nnoncompliance  with  legislative  requirements.  However,  the  Act  covers  some  aspects  of \ngovernment financial transactions that are not new requirements (for example provisions on \ngovernment  borrowings  and  procurement);  they  will  be  outside  the  scope  of  the  TA.  The \nemphasis of the TA will be on (i) improving fiscal practices through better management of public \nexpenditure and revenue to achieve desired social outcomes, and (ii) enhancing government \nand  managerial  accountability  through  timely  and  comprehensive  reporting  of  government \nfinances. \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will finance the provision of consulting services to (i) enable the Government to \nprepare a detailed implementation plan that focuses on government priorities, a realistic and ", "    3 \nsustainable timetable of capacity building, change management, system development; (ii) assist \nthe  implementation  steering  committee,  on  an  intermittent  basis,  to  monitor  progress  and \nrecommend corrective actions as appropriate; and (iii) provide specific technical advice to the \nDepartment of Treasury and the implementation steering committee. \n \n11.  The key output of the TA will be an implementation plan that should be realistic and \nachievable, taking into account the constraints of capacity and resources of the Department of \nTreasury and line agencies. In addition, the TA will provide training materials in public sector \nfinancial management with modern concepts and principles that are appropriate to Samoa\u2019s \ncircumstances and will achieve the Government policy objectives. As the introduction of the Act \nwill be a significant change management exercise, it is important that the implementation plan \nshould be flexible. Thus the transfer of project management skills to a local counterpart will be \ncritical to ensure sustainability of the plan. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will be undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 will (i) analyze and assess the \nrequirements of the legislation, taking into account the current status of other related reform \ninitiatives  in  the  Treasury  and  line  agencies;  (ii)  prioritize  the  components  of  the  Act  in \naccordance with government policy objectives; (iii) prepare a detailed implementation plan with \nspecific assessment of risk, internal and external resource requirements (human, system and \ntraining), and a realistic timetable for implementing each component of the legislation; and (iv) \nprepare a change management and communication plan to ensure understanding, support, and \ncommitment of stakeholders. \n \n13.  Phase  2  will  involve  establishing  an  implementation  steering  committee  comprising \nsenior officials of central agencies (including the audit office) and line agencies. The committee \nwill be supported by a lead consultant who has technical expertise and project management \nexperience in this area. As the implementation is expected to be long term (3\u20135 years), the \nconsultant  will  be  supported  by  a  local  counterpart  who  will  be  trained  to  take  over  the \nmanagement of the Project at the end of the term of the consultant (expected to be around 24 \nmonths of lapsed time). The consultant is responsible for developing technical training materials \n(in public expenditure management, performance-based budget management, accounting and \nfinancial  reporting,  internal  control  systems)  based  on  the  specific budgeting  and  financial \ninformation requirements of the Act, and to assist in developing and delivering the \u201ctrain the \ntrainers\u201d program. The training program is expected to be developed in conjunction with a local \neducational institution (for example the University of Samoa) to ensure that ongoing training will \nbe delivered during and after the implementation period. The TA also provides for short-term \nconsulting services on specific technical components included in the implementation plan. \n \n14.  As  implementation  will  last  for  3  years  at  the  minimum,  it  is  imperative  that  the \nDepartment  of  Treasury  and  line  agencies  be  committed  to  the  process,  in  particular  the \navailability and continuity of local counterparts to manage implementation and to participate in \ntraining  programs.  Additionally  although  the  implementation  plan,  by  necessity,  will  remain \nflexible,  it  is  important  that  government  decisions  on  policies  and  funding  needed  for \nimplementation be adhered to as far as practicable to ensure that early gains are achieved. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $475,000 equivalent, of which $375,000 is \nforeign exchange and $100,000 equivalent is local currency. ADB will finance the total foreign \nexchange cost, and the Government will finance the local currency component. The TA will be ", "4  \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Department of Treasury will be the Executing Agency of the TA. An implementation \nsteering  committee  will  be  established  comprising  representatives  of  the  Department  of \nTreasury; line agencies of large spending departments such as health, education and works; \nsmaller departments such as justice and youth, sports and culture; and budget-dependent \nstatutory agencies such as the Public Service Commission. The Audit Office should be a \nmember  of  the  implementation  steering  committee  to  ensure  that  it  is  aware  of  the \nimplementation plan, particularly the transitional arrangements, and to provide feedback on \ndepartmental implementation especially where it may see difficulties of compliance with policy \nrequirements, and/or where training is needed. \n \n17.  ADB  will  engage  international  consultants  as  individuals  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  One  international  consultant  (lead  consultant)  with \nexperience in public sector financial management reforms will be recruited on an intermittent \nbasis for a total of 10 person-months. Two international consultants (6 person-months), with \nexpertise in financial management training and accounting system software, will be recruited on \na  needs  basis.  The  lead  consultant  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  training  materials  in \ncollaboration  with  the  local  educational  institution.  The  Government  will  engage  a  local \neducational institution to collaborate on the preparation of the training materials, participate in \nthe initial training, and take over training activities at the completion of the TA. The Government, \nwith advice from the lead consultant, will also engage a domestic consultant, in accordance with \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  develop  a  change  management  and  communication \nstrategy to ensure that all public officials fully understand the policy and procedural changes that \nwill affect their daily work plans. The terms of reference for the consultants to be financed by \nADB are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from July 2003 to June 2005. The lead \nconsultant, to be assisted by a local counterpart to be provided by the Department of Treasury, \nwill be responsible for coordinating the work of all members. The consultants will contribute, as \nappropriate, to the progress and final reports to be prepared by the lead consultant. Each \nconsultant, however, will prepare his/her final report on specific achievements and lessons \nlearned from the TA, covering the particular area of expertise/responsibility of the consultant.  \n \nIV.

Scope and Work Program \n1.  The  key  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  provide  the  public  sector  financial  management \nexpertise required in the early stages of implementing the new Public Finance Management Act \nand the transfer of knowledge and skills to local counterparts to reduce long-term reliance on \nforeign experts. The TA aims to institutionalize an acceptable level of support in budgeting and \nfinancial management (including some knowledge of the selected financial software system) to \nensure  that  the  staff  understands  the  practical  requirements  of  the  Act,  and  the  linkages \nbetween output/performance-based budgeting, financial devolution, reporting, and managerial \naccountability. \n2.  The consultants engaged for the TA will provide selected local staff with on-the-job \ntraining  in  the  requirements  of  output/performance-based  public  finance  management  as \napplied in Samoa and as incorporated in the new financial management information system \n(FMIS) that will support the budgeting, accounting, and performance monitoring activities under \nthe performance-oriented management system. As implementation of the Act will be phased \nover a minimum of 3 years, and given that Samoa already has in place a cash-based output \nbudgeting system and a partial introduction of the medium-term expenditure framework within \nTreasury, a pilot implementation is not planned at this stage. It is important, however, that \ntransitional arrangements are carefully planned to enable full implementation at the end of the \nperiod. \nB.  Specific Terms of Reference \n1.  Public Sector Financial Management Specialist/Lead Consultant (10 person-\nmonths) \n3.  The specialist will \n(i)  have extensive experience in public expenditure management, including analysis \nand assessment necessary for implementing a medium-term fiscal framework, \npublic  sector  accounting,  and  budgeting  practices  especially  under  an \noutput/performance-based system. The person is expected to provide technical \nleadership  in  applying  output/performance-based  management  principles  and \npractices to suit Samoa\u2019s circumstances; \n(ii)  be  responsible  for  preparing  a  realistic  and  achievable  implementation  plan, \nwhich takes into account government policy preferences in risk management, \ncurrent skills and capacity, training requirements, and available resources to \nsupport implementation; \n(iii)  provide  the  necessary  expertise  to  establish,  support,  and  advise  the \nimplementation steering committee especially in the early stages, and provide \non-the-job training to a designated local counterpart to ensure gradual transfer of \nresponsibility for successful implementation; \n(iv)  with  assistance  of  the  staff  of  a  selected  local  educational  institution,  be \nresponsible for the technical content of, and oversee the preparation of a training \nprogram to ensure successful implementation of the Act; \n(v)  liaise with the software supplier to ensure that the training program supports the \nintroduction of the new FMIS;  \n \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n(vi)  provide  technical  advice  to  Treasury  staff  in  preparing  public  expenditure \nmanagement,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  instructions  to  support \ndepartmental staff in implementing the new regime of financial devolution and \naccountability; \n(vii)  oversee  and  participate,  as  appropriate,  in  the  initial  training  sessions  to \ndepartmental staff; \n(viii)  advise the implementation steering committee in preparing the communication \nstrategy, delivering briefing sessions, and selecting domestic consultants; and \n(ix)  provide (long-distance) ad hoc advice to the designated local counterpart as \nrequested. \n \n4.  The consultant is responsible for preparing and submitting brief progress reports to the \nimplementation steering committee and ADB, indicating achievement since the last report and \nfuture actions compared with the implementation plan, and liaising with ADB in recruiting short-\nterm consultants to be funded under the TA. Three months before the end of the contract, the \nconsultant will prepare a draft final report setting out milestones achieved to date, what remains \nto be done, and an assessment of the capability of local staff to undertake the tasks. The report \nwill be discussed with ADB and the Government before the completion of the contract. The \nconsultant will need to cooperate with consultants from other external aid agencies (e.g., Pacific \nFinancial Technical Assistance Centre and Australian Agency for International Development) \nwhere such cooperation will facilitate the achievement of the TA objectives. \n \n2.  Financial Management Training Specialist (3 person-months) \n5.  It is likely that a short-term specialist will be needed to supplement the expertise required \nin phase 2 of the TA. In addition to technical knowledge, the person should have a proven \nrecord of successful preparation of training materials and delivery of training workshops in \npublic financial management for finance staff and nonfinance managers. \n \n6.  The specialist will work closely with and support the lead consultant of the TA to achieve \na successful training program and the transfer of skills to local counterparts, including staff of \nthe selected local educational institution, to ensure ongoing training in the future. \n \n7.  As required by the lead consultant, the specialist will prepare reports for input into \nreports to ADB and the implementation steering committee.  \n \n3.  Systems Accountant (3 person-months) \n \n8.  The systems accountant will have experience in financial software packages that are \nappropriate  for  public  sector  application.  The  person  will  liaise  with  the  selected  software \nsupplier to ensure the installed system incorporates users\u2019 specifications that are consistent with \nthe  new  budgeting,  accounting,  and  reporting  requirements  under  the  financial  devolution \nregime of the Act. The accountant will thereafter work closely with the financial management \ntraining specialist and the lead consultant to develop a users\u2019 training program, in conjunction \nwith the software supplier, to ensure that users understand the functions of the system and \nknow how to use the system.
