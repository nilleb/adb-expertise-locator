The  investment  project  has  the  four  outputs: \n(i) strengthened management, financing, and governance of the higher \neducation  system  including  private  higher  education  institutions; \n(ii) enhanced relevance and capacity for quality improvement of higher \neducation; (iii) increased equity and access in higher education; and \n(iv) effective project management and implementation.  \n \nRationale  The Government places strong emphasis on strengthening the higher \neducation system to create a pool of qualified and skilled personnel \nneeded  to  support  the  country\u2019s  graduation  from  least-developed \nstatus.  The  Project  responds  to  policy  priorities  in  the  National \nEducation  System  Reform  Strategy,  2006\u20132015,  approved  by  the \nPrime Minister, and is in line with the Education Sector Development \nFramework  (ESDF),  prepared  as  a  collaborative  effort  by  the \nGovernment and development partners. The higher education system \nneeds a clear vision, coherent policies and strategies, an appropriate \nregulatory framework to promote autonomy and accountability, and a \nroad map to reach regional and international standards in access, \nquality, relevance, attractiveness, and competitiveness. The Project \nwill  support  the  development  of  the  higher  education  system  and \ninstitutions to meet the growing demand for educated citizens and a \nskilled  workforce,  and  prepare  the  Lao  PDR  for  regional  and \ninternational economic integration.  \n \nImpact and Outcome  The  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved  economic \ncompetitiveness and increased employment opportunities for higher \neducation graduates. The Project's expected outcome is an expanded, \nimproved, and equitable higher education system by 2015.  \n ", "ii \nProject Investment Plan  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $28.8  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $1.6 million.  \n \nFinancing Plan  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  grant  of \n  $24,800,000 from ADB's Special Funds resources. The Government \n  will provide $2,000,000 as counterpart financing and partner foreign \nuniversities will provide $2,000,000.  \n \nTentative Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank (ADF Grant)  24.80    86.10 \nGovernment    2.00    6.95 \nPartner Foreign Universities    2.00    6.95 \n  Total  28.80    100.00 \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2016 \n \nEstimated Project  31 December 2015 \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education (MOE) \n \nImplementation  MOE will be the Executing Agency for the Project. A project steering \nArrangements  committee,  chaired  by  the  MOE  vice  minister  in  charge  of  higher \n  education, will provide overall guidance to the Project and support \ncross-agency policy dialogue. A project coordination unit, headed by \ndirector general of the Department of Higher Education (DHE) within \nMOE, will be established to facilitate coordination and policy dialogue \nacross MOE departments and the participating universities, as well as \nday-to-day coordination with other relevant agencies. A DHE project \nimplementation  unit  (D-PIU)  will  be  established  to  provide  central \ncoordination and supervision for project implementation. PIUs will be \nestablished in each participating university to coordinate with the D-\nPIU and concerned provincial authorities in implementing the Project, \nincluding  procurement  activities,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  To \nimplement staff and faculty development strategies and plan, a central \nprofessional development unit will be established under DHE, which \nwill  be  located  at  NUOL  and  linked  to  outreach  professional \ndevelopment units established at CU and SU. The MOE vice minister \nand  DHE  director  general  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing \nimplementation of the gender and ethnic groups action plan. \n \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the ADB grant will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The D-PIU will be responsible for all procurement, \nexcept for civil works, equipment, furniture, and vehicles at CU, which \nwill be done by the CU PIU in close consultation with the D-PIU. \n ", "iii \nProcurement of goods such as computers and laboratory equipment \nwill use international competitive bidding procedures if more than $1.0 \nmillion, national competitive bidding if $1.0 million or less but more \nthan  $100,000  equivalent,  or  shopping  if  less  than  $100,000 \nequivalent.  Civil  works  will  use  international  competitive  bidding  if \nmore than $2.0 million and national competitive bidding if less, but \nmore than $100,000. Prior review will be used in the procurement \nprocesses. \n \nConsulting Services  The consulting services for the Project will total 220 person-months \n  (95 person-months international and 125 person-months national) to \n  be engaged through a firm. All consultants financed will be recruited in \nline  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  selection  and  engagement  of \nconsulting  services  will  be  done  in  a  single  package  using  the \nsimplified  technical  proposal  and  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod, and follow the standard quality-cost ratio of 80:20. In addition, \nforeign visiting scholars and/or professionals will be recruited as short-\nterm consultants on an individual basis. Any assets purchased will be \nprocured using ADB's Procurement Guidelines and, upon completion \nof the Project, will be turned over to MOE. \n \nProject Benefits and  The main project benefits will be improved management, financing, \nBeneficiaries  governance,  relevance,  quality,  and  equity  and  access  in  higher \neducation. These will be achieved by (i) establishing an effective and \nfunctional governance structure, financial management, and quality \nassurance systems in higher education; (ii) enhancing relevance of \ncourse, curriculum, and teaching materials; (iii) upgrading staff and \nteacher qualifications with appropriate postgraduate degrees by staff \nand faculty development programs, (iv) improving the teaching and \nlearning  environment,  mainly  at  CU;  (v)  effectively  targeting \ndisadvantaged  students  and  supporting  their  study  programs;  and \n(vi)  increasing  the  number  of  undergraduate  students  in  public \nuniversities by 2015 in accordance with the ESDF target. The direct \nbeneficiaries will be the nearly 400,000 university graduates of the \nimproved and expanded higher education system including 300,000 at \nNUOL, 53,000 at CU, and 47,000 at SU; and faculty and teaching \nstaff.  \n \nThe Project is designed to benefit the poor, women, and ethnic groups \nby  better  targeting  them,  especially  female  students  from  ethnic \ngroups, under (i) the revised student quota system to increase the \nratio  of  female  quota  students  from  ethnic  groups,  and  (ii)  the \nprovision  of  increased  living  allowances  to  disadvantaged  quota \nstudents.  In  addition,  due  to  expanded  female  dormitory \naccommodation and female amenities blocks, the number of female \nstudents  enrolled  at  CU  will  increase  from  1,713  (35%  of  total \nenrollments)  to  4,000  by  2015  (50%).  Recruitment  and  training  of \nfaculty members and staff will give special preference to women from \nethnic groups.  \n \n ", "iv \nRisks and Assumptions  A primary risk for the higher education system is that the envisaged \nuniversity  autonomy  will  not  be  materialized  fully  and  will  not  be \naccompanied  by  independent  university  governance  structure,  and \nadequate  flexibility  in  financial  mechanisms  to  enable  public \nuniversities  to  reach  regional  standards  in  teaching,  learning,  and \nresearch. This risk may be mitigated through (i) the ESDF annual \nplanning  and  policy  dialogue  process,  (ii)  the  ongoing  review  and \nassessment process by senior MOE officials and other stakeholders to \nsecure broad support of the reform agenda, and (iii) advisory support \nfrom ADB and other development agencies for ongoing policy studies \nand related reforms.  \n \nQuota  students  are  not  charged  tuition  fees  and  receive  living \nallowances.  The  Project  intends  to  restructure  the  student  quota \nadmission system to improve targeting of poor and disadvantaged \nstudents so that the overall budget allocation in the form of tuition \nsubsidies and living allowances will be more equitable. This initiative \nmay  encounter  political  difficulties  with  resistance  from  those  who \nwould lose privileges. However most provinces have indicated their in-\nprinciple  agreement  to  reduce  the  number  of  quota  students.  To \nmitigate this risk, the Project will support (i) continuing dialogue on \nstudent admission reform between public university presidents and \nconcerned provincial authorities, (ii) promoting public campaigns, and \n(iii) introducing the phased reduction of the number of quota students.  \n \nPublic universities may not be able to recover costs of their operations \nincluding salaries of staff and faculty members, and operation and \nmaintenance of the facilities and equipment to be developed under the \nProject,  such  as  information  and  communication  technology-based \nteaching and learning centers. This risk is mitigated by (i) a prime \nministerial decree enabling public universities to charge tuition fees for \nregular nonquota students, who will comprise approximately 80% of \nuniversity  intakes;  and  (ii)  advisory  support  to  increase  university \nrevenues through income-generating activities.  \n \nA  further  risk  may  be  represented  by  MOE\u2019s  limited  capacity  to \nmanage and implement new policies envisaged under the Project. \nThis risk can be mitigated by extensive advisory support for sector \nplanning  and  management,  and  consulting  services  to  facilitate \nimplementation  of  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  to  be \ndeveloped during project implementation. \n ", " \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Strengthening Higher Education \nProject (the Project). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  The Government seeks to achieve economic growth with reduced poverty to meet the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and graduate from its least-developed country \nstatus by 2020. The Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 (SEDP6) provides a \ncoherent and cohesive development framework, identifying education as one of the four pillars \nof  its  poverty  reduction  strategy.  The  SEDP6  recognizes that  education  is  fundamental  to \nsocioeconomic development, since it equips citizens with skills and attitudes required in a \nrapidly changing society.1 Continued modernization and the shift to a more knowledge- and \ntechnology-based economy place growing pressure on the Lao PDR to expand and improve the \nhigher education system and institutions. However, the higher education system still lacks a \nclear vision, policy and strategies, and road map to reach regional and international standards in \naccess,  quality,  relevance,  and  competitiveness.  The  Government  asked  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support the development of the higher education system to meet \ngrowing demands for educated citizens and a skilled workforce, and to help prepare the Lao \nPDR for regional and international economic integration.2 The Project is included as a firm \nproject in 2009 in the midterm review for the 2007\u20132011 country strategy and program.3 \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.   Socioeconomic and Poverty Indicators. The Lao PDR, one of the poorest countries in \nAsia and the Pacific, experiences many constraints to development and poverty reduction, \nincluding in the education sector. However, economic performance has been impressive over \nthe past 5 years. Real gross domestic product growth averaged 7.3% between 2003 and 2008. \nWhile 7.9% growth is projected for 2009, the impact of the current global recession must be \ncarefully monitored. Per capita income climbed to $840 in 2008 from $581 in 2006. Rapid \neconomic growth has contributed to substantial progress in poverty reduction, with the national \npoverty incidence falling from 33.3% in 2003 to 28% in 2008. Steady progress to achieving the \nMDGs is noted with declining fertility, improving infant and child mortality rates, and increasing \nschool enrollment. Demographic projections show the secondary school and higher education \nage populations reaching their maximum size between 2005 and 2020. Thus, one outcome of \nachieving the MDGs is a burgeoning demand for higher education. \n \n4.  Education Sector Performance. The Government has made considerable progress in \nimproving access to education. From 2000 to 2005, the net enrollment ratio4 for primary education \nincreased from 80% to 84%; the gross enrollment ratio5 for lower secondary increased from 47% \nto 52%, and for upper secondary from 23% to 35%. Progress with girls' enrollment has been \nrapid. The gender differential at primary grades has dropped by appropriately 7.4% since 1996 \n                                                 \n1  Government of the Lao PDR, Committee for Planning and Investment. 2005.

Manila. \n4  The net enrollment ratio refers to pupils enrolled from the eligible age group.  \n5  The gross enrollment ratio refers to total pupils enrolled. ", "2 \n(from 21.6% to 14.2% in 2005).6 At lower secondary, girls' enrollment increased by more than 4% \nfrom 2003 to 2005, compared with a 1.9% increase for boys. During the same period, girls' upper \nsecondary enrollment increased by 4.4% compared with a 5.5% increase for boys. Even so, \nsignificant gender differentials remain: Girls' enrollment in primary lags by approximately 14%, and \nat the entry level for lower secondary education is more than 10% less than that of boys. \nExtensive external development support has concentrated on primary education to meet the MDG \nof universal completion of primary education by 2015. If primary education absorbs all external \nfunding, subsequent levels of education will continue to be neglected, which will have serious \nramifications. First, the gains from increased primary enrollments may be lost if lower and upper \nsecondary are not ready to absorb primary school graduates. Second, quality and access issues \nbecome more difficult to resolve with increasing numbers of students (footnote 3). The rise in \nupper  secondary  enrollment,  a  growing  school  age  population,  and  declining  poverty  have \nresulted in an explosion in the demand for technical and vocational education and training (TVET) \nand  higher  education.  As  this  relentless  demand  occurs  as  the  country  moves  through  its \ndemographic transition, the quality of postsecondary education must be improved before this \nlargest age cohort moves into the labor force.  \n \n5.  Government  Sector  Strategy  and  Institutions.  To  graduate  from  least-developed \ncountry status by 2020 and to prepare for the country\u2019s regional and international integration, \nthe Government initiated higher education reforms covering both public and private higher \neducation institutions (HEIs) with the Prime Ministerial Decree on the Establishment of the \nNational  University  of  Laos  (NUOL)  in  1995,  and  subsequent  decrees  on  private  higher \neducation in 1995 and higher education curriculum in 2001. The decree establishing NUOL \nbegan to address the issue of a fragmented higher education system by amalgamating 10 HEIs \nunder a unified structure of NUOL. Within the framework, two regional universities were later \nestablished to broaden access to higher education: (i) Champasak University (CU) in Pakse in \nsouthern Lao PDR in 2002, and (ii) Souphanouvong University (SU) in Luang Prabang in \nnorthern Lao PDR in 2003. Meanwhile, the decree on private higher education defined a legal \nframework for establishing and operating private HEIs, and triggered the growth of private HEIs. \nIn 2007, the Prime Ministerial Decree on the Adoption and Implementation of the National \nEducation System Reform Strategy (NESRS) (2006\u20132015) was issued. The decree called for \nstrengthened HEIs to move the higher education system toward regional and international \nstandards, and contribute to the socioeconomic development of the country. NUOL was given \nautonomous  administrative  authority.  SU  and  CU  were  given  autonomous  administrative \nauthorities by the Prime Ministerial Decree on the Organization and the Activities of the SU and \nCU, issued in March and April 2009, respectively.  \n \n6.   The Ministry of Education (MOE) has broad oversight of all education development in \nthe Lao PDR, and MOE\u2019s Department of Higher Education (DHE), which was separated from \nthe Department of Higher, Technical and Vocational Education in April 2008, provides overall \npolicy  guidance  to  public  universities,  undertakes  planning  and  coordination  with  other \ngovernment  ministries  and  agencies  for  developing  the  higher  education  system,  and \ncooperates with development partners in support of higher education. Under the Government's \ndecentralization process, MOE shares responsibilities with the provincial education services \n(PESs)  and  the  district  education  bureaus.  The  PESs  are  responsible  for  secondary,  and \ntechnical and vocational schools not under MOE jurisdiction. In cooperation with the PESs and \npublic universities, MOE administers university entrance examinations in each province, while \nthe PESs are responsible for selecting quota students based on upper secondary completion \nexamination  scores  and  recommendations.  District  education  bureaus  are  responsible  for \n                                                 \n6  Ministry of Education. 2008. Education for All Mid-Decade Assessment. Vientiane.  \n ", "3 \npreschools, primary schools, and nonformal education institutions. NUOL, CU, and SU, as first \nrank budgeting units, have their own budgets and can request annual budgets directly from the \nMinistry of Finance, which is responsible for allocating staff salaries and other recurrent costs. \n \n7.  At present, higher education in the Lao PDR comprises three public universities (NUOL, \nCU, and SU), the Ministry of Health-administered University of Health Sciences, five teacher \ntraining colleges, and 86 private HEIs. In 2008, about 5.3% of the tertiary education age cohort \nwas enrolled at the HEIs. Student enrollment at the three public universities totalled 45,677 \n(NUOL with 36,706, CU with 4,755, and SU with 4,216), increasing by about 10,000 in 1 year \nalone from 35,403 in 2007. The number of students at private HEIs increased from 4,000 in 2000 \nto  almost  20,000  in  2007.  However,  in  2007,  only  24,754  of  43,653  students  (about  57%) \ngraduating from upper secondary school gained access to public and private HEIs. This gap \nbetween enrollment demand and admission capacity of public universities is expected to widen if \ncurrent  trends  continue.  The  public  university  admission  system  comprises  three  types  of \nstudents: (i) quota students, who are exempt from all fees and receive a small living allowance, \naccount for roughly 50% of total enrollment; (ii) regular nonquota students, who take the university \nentrance  examination  and  pay  a  modest  registration  fee,  comprise  another  20%  of  total \nenrollment; and (iii) an additional roughly 30% of students are enrolled in \"special courses;\" they \nare not selected from university entrance examination results but sit for entrance examinations of \nspecific faculties; they are charged tuition and registration fees. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n8.   Higher education in the Lao PDR is at a nascent stage of development. The higher \neducation  system  and  institutions  need  to  be  strengthened  and  upgraded  by  improving  \n(i) management, financing, and governance; (ii) relevance, quality, and efficiency; and (iii) equity \nand access.7 An analysis of higher education is in Appendix 2.  \n \n1.  Governance, Finance, and Management  \n \n9.   Weak  Management  Capacity. The higher education system lacks overall planning, \nmanagement, and monitoring. DHE\u2019s management capacity is not adequate for it to meet its \nresponsibilities. Capacity building of DHE personnel to effectively and efficiently manage the \nhigher education system is an MOE priority. In addition, higher education does not currently \nhave a standardized system for the coordinated collection, dissemination, and utilization of up-\nto-date  data  and  information  to  support  policy  development,  planning,  administration,  and \nmanagement of higher education.  \n \n10.  Inadequate  Higher  Education  Financing.  Public  expenditure  on  education  (both \nrecurrent  and  capital  budget)  has  been  increasing  in  recent  years.  However,  the  budget \nallocation for education, including external aid, for 2008\u20132009 varies from 10% to 14% of the \ntotal government budget (depending on the budget data sources). In higher education, the \npercentage of recurrent expenditure is almost 90% of the total higher education budget, while \nthe  capital  investment  is  10%.  Despite  the  extremely  high  proportion  of  budgetary  funds \nallocated for salaries and student stipends, the allotment is still insufficient to provide adequate \nsalaries  and  other  financial  incentives  to  teaching  staff  in  universities.  Resources  for \nmaintenance, renovation, infrastructure improvement, and academic and staff development are \nvirtually nonexistent (excepting external aid). The problem is compounded by the limited formal \nattention given to cost recovery by introducing adequate tuition fees and improving targeting of \n                                                 \n7  Information for this section is largely drawn from ADB. 2009. Final Report for Technical Assistance for Preparing \nthe Strengthening Higher Education Project. Manila.  \n ", "4 \nquota students receiving a government subsidy. While expansion of private HEIs helps lessen \nthe financial burden on the public sector and absorbs excess or unmet demand for higher \neducation, public HEIs urgently need to expand cost-recovery measures and make the public \nhigher education system more cost-efficient and sustainable. This in turn will expand resources \navailable for investment in basic education.  \n \n11.   Weak University Governance. A series of prime ministerial decrees on the organization \nand activities of NUOL, CU, and SU were issued in March and April 2009. Although NUOL has \nalready established a university council, executive board, and board of academic affairs, CU \nand  SU  still  need  to  establish  functional  governance  structures  and  well-defined  financial \nmanagement systems, based on the new decrees. Moreover, the precise governance status of \nCU and SU, in particular their degree of autonomy and relationship with the private sector, \nremains unclear. Appropriate governance reforms (including clarification of their governance \nstructure  and  status)  represent  an  essential  precondition  for  the  implementation  of  reform \nstrategies for higher education.  \n \n12.   Lack  of  Coherent  Regulatory  Framework  for  Private  HEIs. In recent years, the \nnumber of private HEIs has grown rapidly to absorb excess demand for higher education. \nHowever, private HEIs are largely unregulated. Little information is available on the relevance \nand quality of these institutions. The Government needs to help the private sector ensure quality \nby  establishing  standards  and  quality  assurance  procedures.  Development  of  a  coherent \nregulatory framework is urgently required to ensure their quality standards and relevance to \nlabor market demand.  \n \n2.  Relevance, Quality, and Efficiency \n \n13.   Unknown Relevance. No labor surveys or labor market projections are available for use \nto measure the performance of the tertiary system or education planning. In 2005, 93% of the \nlabor force are own account and unpaid family workers; only 7% are formal sector employees \nalmost equally divided between government and the private sector.8 Rapid labor market surveys \ncarried out under the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) are a first step in tracking \ngraduates in the labor market (footnote 2). Appropriate tracer studies need to be launched to \ncollect benchmark information and monitor their performance in the labor market. Initial results \nindicate  a  shortage  of  professional  and  technical  personnel  such  as  administrators, \naccountants, lawyers, and engineers in public and private sectors; and growing demand in the \ncommercial  sector  such  as  customer  service,  hotel  and  guesthouse  operations,  foreign \nlanguages, tourism operations, and computer technology. These fields are offered by the higher \neducation system, yet graduates report difficulty getting jobs in their field of study. One partial \nexplanation of this apparent market failure may be an inefficient job placement system and the \nemployer's desire for experienced staff against the graduate's need for a first job.  \n \n14.  The pool of university graduates is young. From 2000 to 2006, the number of graduates \nproduced by the public system increased from 2,200 per year to 6,000 per year. The bulk of \nuniversity graduates are still in transition in their first job or developing their understanding of the \nworkplace and work skills. The difficulty is compounded by the out-of-date learning material and \ninexperience of their instructors. The private sector is also young: 20% of all enterprises were \nestablished less than 1 year ago and 60% are less than 5 years old; only 2.4% have more than \n10 employees.9 One result of this young employer and young employee profile is a shortfall in \n                                                 \n8  Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2005.

Vientiane. \n ", "5 \nsupervisors with capacity for developing new staff. This contributes to the frustration reported by \nemployers that university graduates lack the right skills and the frustration by students that they \ncannot practice what they were taught. \n \n15.  Irrelevant  Curriculum  and  Textbooks.  In  accordance  with  the  NESRS,  MOE  will \nintroduce a new system of 5 years primary, 4 years lower secondary, 3 years upper secondary, \nand 4 years higher education (undergraduate) in a phased manner from September 2009 to \nSeptember 2011. National higher education curriculum reform should be planned in connection \nwith  NESRS  implementation.  Whereas  public  universities  formally  offered  a  common  core \n\"foundation studies\" curriculum to all students at the start of their university studies, NUOL has \ndissolved its former School of Foundation Studies. Similarly, individual faculties of CU and SU \nneed to prepare to conduct their own basic foundation programs. This creates inconsistencies \nand duplication of efforts, and may not be the most effective and efficient use of limited faculty \nresources, textbooks, and materials, or provide the best grounding for students. To enhance \nrelevance  and  effectiveness  of  curriculum  and  textbooks,  a  strengthened  interdisciplinary \ncommon-core curriculum and textbooks need to be introduced as foundation programs to be \noffered throughout different faculties at year 1, and faculty-specific curriculum and textbooks \nand materials developed for specialization programs for years 2\u20134.  \n \n16.   Weak Quality Assurance, Accreditation, and Credit System. Quality assurance and \naccreditation  systems  are  under  development,  but  are  not  yet  functioning.  MOE\u2019s  Quality \nAssurance Center (QAC) is currently responsible for developing quality assurance policies and \nprocedures for all education subsectors, including public and private higher education as well as \nsecondary  education  and  technical  education  and  vocational  training.  However,  QAC  is \nrelatively new and its capacity needs to be greatly strengthened. Currently, no standardized \nsystem is in place to allocate credit for subject units completed from year to year. Credit is \nallocated on the basis of contact time rather than total workload. Student transfer between \nuniversities is very difficult due to the lack of a standardized credit system. \n \n17.   Low Qualifications of Academic Staff. The quality of higher education is low due to \nunderqualified  academic  staff.  Few  faculty  members  have  postgraduate  qualifications, \nparticularly at the newly opened CU and SU, and their research and teaching capacity are \ngreatly  constrained.  While  NUOL  has  a  reasonably  well-qualified  teaching  staff  with \napproximately 32% (490 of 1,520 teaching staff) having postgraduate degrees, the situation at \nCU and SU is problematic. Of 221 academic staff at CU, only 4 have doctoral qualifications and \n31 have master\u2019s degrees. Of the 192 total staff at SU, only 2 have doctoral degrees and 21 \nhave master\u2019s degrees. University teaching capacities are further constrained by excessive time \nspent teaching additional fee-based special courses up to 30 hours per week or more. Due to \nlow formal salaries paid to academic staff, public universities have difficulty retaining skilled and \nexperienced academic personnel, leaving the universities with an insufficient number of young, \nunderqualified,  and  relatively  inexperienced  staff.  Both  teacher  performance  and  students\u2019 \nacademic performance are largely unknown compared with regional and international standards.  \n \n18.  Weak Research Capacity. The academic research capacity of faculty members is quite \nlimited. Time spent teaching in special courses held mostly in the evenings, and the absence of \nappropriate research infrastructure and funding compound the problem. The type of research \ntargeted for these universities directly supports degree education and teaching, since the higher \neducation system and institutions in the Lao PDR are in their early stage of development and \nthe three public universities (NUOL, CU, and SU) continue to focus on degree education rather \nthan on the development of science and technology disciplines as research universities. Among \nthe three public universities, only NUOL has a reasonably well-qualified teaching staff with \n ", "6 \npostgraduate degrees who can carry out some research activities; the other two universities are \nconstrained by a severe shortage of qualified teaching staff and limited research facilities. \n \n19.   Inadequate  Teaching  and  Learning  Environment.  Teaching  and  learning \nenvironments need to be greatly improved by investing in facilities, equipment, and materials. \nWhile NUOL and SU are relatively well developed and equipped, the newly opened CU lacks \nadequate physical facilities including library, laboratory facilities and equipment, auditorium, \nclassrooms, and other essential teaching and learning equipment and materials. CU's campus \ninfrastructure (e.g., water and power supply, road conditions, and drainage system) and facilities \nare  in  dilapidated  condition  and  cannot  support  further  increases.  Library  facilities  using \ninformation  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  vary  considerably  across  each  campus. \nAccess to computers with internet terminals at NUOL and SU is limited. CU currently has no \nviable libraries with internet access to serve the faculty and students. Site development plans for \nCU propose the construction of a multipurpose central building to be used for establishing an \nICT-based teaching and learning center incorporating e-library facilities. Laboratories, especially \nat CU, lack appropriate equipment and materials for teaching and research.  \n \n20.  Weak International Links. International partnerships are largely symbolic rather than \npractical,  and  are  not  adequately  resourced.  The  three  public  universities  are  promoting \ncooperation with foreign universities and institutions (e.g., student and faculty exchange, joint \nresearch, and publication) to foster international recognition and attractiveness. For example, \nNUOL has about 145 academic exchange agreements with foreign universities and institutions; \nhowever, to date these endeavors have had limited success or influence on education quality. \nInternationalization of Lao universities and their linkages to international standard or world class \nuniversities must be promoted on a long-term and sustainable basis.  \n \n3.  Equity and Access \n \n21.   Disparities  in  Enrollment  and  Quota  System.  Socioeconomic,  gender,  and  ethnic \ndisparities in access still persist, resulting in low representation of women and ethnic students \nfrom low-income families. In 2008, the share of female students was 35.3% at NUOL, 36.6% at \nSU, and 49% at CU. The quota system of admission was originally intended to increase access \nto higher education for ethnic origin students. The provinces identify quota students in principle \non  the  basis  of  seeking  equity  by  gender  and  ethnicity.  At  NUOL,  ethnic  quota  students \ncomprise  approximately  35%  and  ethnic  female  quota  students  approximately  17%  of  the \nstudent population. However, better targeting of quota students is needed to increase equity in \naccess to higher education. Provision of a substantial amount of state subsidies to students \nfrom more affluent families (rather than for lowering barriers to students who otherwise have no \ncapacity to pay) is inequitable and diverts budgetary resources from interventions to increase \naccess and quality. At the same time, when disadvantaged students are correctly targeted, \nmany are academically behind other students, as they have not been adequately prepared by \nthe  general  schooling  system.  The  academic  preparation  of  quota  students  needs  to  be \nimproved. A gap also exists between the rural poor and urban nonpoor in terms of opportunities \nand access to higher education. Poor rural students are reluctant to enrol in courses that require \nmathematics for entrance or course exams. They generally enrol in education, geography, \nlinguistics, or agriculture where they can be easily accepted.  \n \n22.  Gap between Enrollment and Limited Capacity. The demand for higher education is \nprojected to increase. While NUOL and SU have expanded their enrollment capacity mainly \nbecause of external assistance in developing the campus and facilities, the need for additional \nfacilities and classrooms at CU to meet growing local demand is overwhelming. Among the \nthree  public  universities,  CU  has  the  most  basic  infrastructure  and  facilities.  Since  its \n ", "7 \nestablishment in 2002, the number of students has increased from 400 to 4,755. Classroom \nspace at CU is extremely limited, crowded, and often shared among faculties in a suboptimal \nmanner. The gap between enrollment demand and admission capacity of public universities, \nespecially at CU, is expected to widen in the future if current trends continue. In response, many \nsmall private HEIs have emerged in recent years (mainly offering diplomas in business-related \nareas  such  as  business  administration,  computer  and  information  science,  and  English \nlanguage) to meet this unmet demand.  \n \n4.  Lessons  \n \n23.  For tertiary education, ADB supported the establishment and development of NUOL \nfrom  1995  to  2003  under  the  Postsecondary  Education  Rationalization  Project, 10 when \nimproving the quality of NUOL and developing two universities (CU and SU) were envisaged as \nthe next phase in the development of higher education. One of the loan covenants under the \nPostsecondary Education Rationalization Project was to reduce the number of quota students to \n50%;  this  serves  as  a  benchmark  ratio  of  quota  students  in  2009.  The  national  entrance \nexamination was established for the first time for the 1996 intake at NUOL. The students are \nnow referred to as nonquota students. Other specific lessons from the Postsecondary Education \nRationalization Project are that NUOL needs to (i) give priority to the quality of education and \nhuman resources that it produces; and (ii) ensure its external efficiency by promoting an alumni \nassociation, including employers as members of the university council; establishing a regular \nmonitoring function, in particular the graduate tracer study; and introducing career counseling.11 \nThese lessons are incorporated in the project design as appropriate.  \n \n24.  ADB has also supported postsecondary and higher education projects in Bangladesh, \nCambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam; and is preparing \nnew postsecondary and higher education projects in Indonesia, Mongolia, Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam. A major relevant lesson from projects is that key private enterprises need to be involved at \nthe design phase to ensure that the skills taught are relevant to market demand. The Project \naddresses  this  lesson  by  (i)  undertaking  periodic  tracer  studies  of  university  graduates  in \ncooperation with private enterprises, (ii) introducing career orientation and counseling programs \nbased on results of tracer studies, and (iii) including representatives from local industries as \nuniversity council members. Across sectors, concerns relate to the capacity to manage and \nimplement projects; these are incorporated in the project design to increase effectiveness of \nproject management and implementation.  \n \n  5.  Asian Development Bank Country Strategy and Program \n \n25.  In line with the SEDP6 strategies and priorities, ADB's 2007\u20132010 country strategy and \nprogram aims to assist the Lao PDR in (i) promoting pro-poor, sustainable growth; (ii) fostering \ninclusive social development; and (iii) addressing priority  governance issues (footnote  3).  In \naddition, ADB\u2019s priority sector support remains fully aligned with the four core sectors under the \nSEDP6: agriculture, health, education, and infrastructure. The 2009 midterm review of the country \nstrategy and program confirms that ADB\u2019s strategy for the education sector should continue to \ngive priority to helping the Government expand access to a full range of quality schooling for all \nchildren,  with  continuing  investments  in  basic  education  with  a  focus  on  lower  secondary \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1995.

This will need to be matched by a gradual shift in emphasis to strengthening upper \nsecondary education and providing better vocational, technical, and higher education.  \n \n26.  Although fully cognizant of the need to strengthen basic education, as being supported \nby  the  Second  Education  Quality  Improvement  Project  and  the  Basic  Education  Sector \nDevelopment Program,12 ADB shares the Government\u2019s concern of the need for balanced \neducation sector development and gradual expansion of access to TVET (PPTA in 200913 and \nan ensuing project in 2010) and higher education (PPTA in 2008 and an ensuing project in \n2009) (footnote 2) to meet the demand for greater educational attainment and a more educated \nand skilled workforce. In supporting higher education, ADB will help the Government improve \nhigher education financing to become shared, cost-efficient, and sustainable, which will in turn \nenhance sustainability of the entire education system, including basic education.  \n \n6.  Asian Development Bank and Other External Assistance \n \n27.  Several  development  partners  provide  assistance  to  the  education  sector.14 The \nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID), European Commission, and World \nBank focus on supporting primary education. The German development cooperation through the \nGerman Agency for Technical Cooperation and the Luxembourg Government focus on TVET. \nThe Republic of Korea, through the Export-Import Bank of Korea, supported the development of \nSU from 2005 to 2006. The Education Sector Working Group, cochaired by AusAID and United \nNations Children's Fund (UNICEF), coordinates development aid. While the existence of the \nEducation Sector Working Group has led to improved aid coordination, provincial coordination \nof development partner interventions remains mixed. AusAID, European Commission, UNICEF, \nand the World Bank are also supporting the Poverty Reduction Support Operation including \neducation triggers. Most recently, concerned development partners endorsed the Government's \napplication to the Catalytic Fund under the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative. A summary of \nexternal assistance is in Appendix 3. \n \n28.  MOE, in collaboration with development partners, has developed the Education Sector \nDevelopment Framework (ESDF) to cover planning and investment across the full education \nsector for 2009\u20132015. ADB partnered with AusAID to support development of the ESDF. The \nESDF outlines policy priorities for improving access to education services; improving the quality \nand relevance of education services; and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of education \nplanning,  management,  and  administration  of  the  sector.  The  ESDF  provides  a  vehicle  for \nestablishing education priorities to match resource availability and will enable the formulation of \nannual costed and prioritized plans, which are a requirement of the Vientiane Declaration Country \nAction Plan in line with the Paris Declaration of Aid Effectiveness in 2005. The Annual Sector Plan \nfor 2009\u20132010, under the ESDF process, includes improvement and expansion of facilities at CU, \nand improvement of quality of teaching and learning at universities. It includes the development of \na higher education master plan for 2010\u20132020, which is under preparation with support from the \nADB PPTA for preparing the Strengthening Higher Education Project (footnote 2).  \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2001.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n29.  The  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved  economic  competitiveness  and \nincreased employment opportunities of higher education graduates. The Project's expected \noutcome is an expanded, improved, and equitable higher education system by 2015.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n30.   The  Project  will  deliver  four  outputs  to  achieve  the  outcome:  (i)  strengthened \nmanagement,  financing,  and  governance  of  the  higher  education  system;  (ii)  enhanced \nrelevance and capacity for quality improvement; (iii) increased equity and access in higher \neducation; and (iv) effective project management and implementation.  \n \n1.  Output 1: Strengthened Management, Financing, and Governance of the \nHigher Education System  \n \n31.   The Project will build management, financing, and governance of the higher education \nsystem through (i) strengthened management capacity of MOE and public HEIs, (ii) improved \nhigher education financing, and (iii) enhanced governance systems for public and private HEIs.  \n \na.  Strengthened Management Capacity of MOE and Public HEIs \n \n32.  The Project will enhance the management capacity of DHE, to be responsible for overall \nstrategic planning and master plan development, and for operations oversight of the higher \neducation system in the Lao PDR. DHE is expected to be reorganized to better perform its \nmandate and functions, including jurisdiction over private HEIs offering degrees, which will \nrequire upgraded planning and management skills and knowledge. The Project will strengthen \nmanagement  capacity  of  relevant  DHE  staff  by  supporting  (i)  in-country  and  international \ntraining; (ii) degree programs (indicatively four DHE staff in master\u2019s programs and three in \ndoctoral  programs);  and  (iii)  DHE  participation  in  international  forums,  conferences,  and \nassociations (including membership fees). The Project will develop a management information \nsystem (MIS) comprising financial management, personnel management including faculty and \nstudent database, and student admission data; and provide capacity development support to \nmanagement staff for implementing the MIS to enhance management efficiency throughout the \nhigher education system at DHE and each public HEI. The Project will help DHE prepare annual \nand periodic reports and newsletters, and in coordination with MOE\u2019s Department of Planning \nand  Cooperation,  better  manage  projects  and  programs  supported  by  official  development \nassistance.  \n \nb.  Improved Higher Education Financing \n \n33.  Support will be provided to improve financing of higher education to become more \nshared, cost-efficient, and sustainable. The Project will help MOE and public universities to \n(i)  review  the  budgeting  process  and  mechanism  to  identify  weakness,  and  improve,  for \nexample, its efficiency and relevance by adding a specific budget line of block funding to cover \noperation and maintenance, and depreciation of facilities and equipment; (ii) restructure the \nquota student admission system to improve targeting of poor and disadvantaged students so \nthat overall budget allocation in the form of tuition subsidies and living allowances will be more \nequitable; (iii) increase tuition fees for regular nonquota students; and (iv) diversify the revenue \nsources of public universities, in cooperation with the private sector.  \n \n ", "10 \n34.   The prime ministerial decrees issued during March\u2013April 2009 enable public universities to \ncharge tuition fees. The Project will support the preparation and introduction of tuition fees for \nregular nonquota courses and the regularization of special courses staring from 2011/12 onward. \nThe fees generated  will contribute to financing recurrent  operating costs of the universities, \nincluding staff salaries. In association with the phased reduction of quota students from 50% in \n2009 to 30% by 2013 and 20% by 2015 (to better target disadvantaged students), tuition fees will \nbe progressively charged for the remaining 80% of nonquota students, as a significant cost \nrecovery  measure  for  universities.  Different  tuition  fees  are  expected  to  be  charged  among \nprograms depending on their cost-recovery prospects. Tuition fees for regular nonquota courses \nshould be equivalent to those charged for special courses, which should cease to exist as a \nseparate concept or category by 2015. In addition, the Government will promulgate decrees for \nimplementation in 2011 to introduce (i) a revised and increased dormitory fee for regular nonquota \nstudents; and (ii) improved benefit structure for staff of public HEIs. \n  \nc.  Enhanced Governance Systems for Public and Private HEIs \n \n35.  To strengthen the governance capacity at public universities, the Project will support the \nestablishment of clearly defined governance and management structures at each university. A \nuniversity council, similar to the one established at NUOL, will be established at CU and SU. \nMembership in university councils will include 30% representation from outside the university, \nincluding local government, private sector, and cultural and related social sectors by 2013. At \nleast 40% of council members will be women by 2014. The Project will assist in developing and \nstrengthening the role of the university president by proposing that in future the role be filled by \na competitive recruitment process, subject to final approval by MOE and the Prime Minister\u2019s \noffice.  The  Project  will  provide  short-  and  long-term  training,  as  well  as  ongoing  capacity \nbuilding for administration staff of NUOL, CU, and SU; and provide related facilities at CU. At \nleast 30% of staff or faculty members trained will be women. \n \n36.  The Government will encourage the expansion of private HEIs, to relieve some of the \nburden of financing higher education from limited government financial resources; this will \nabsorb  excess  demand  for  higher  education.  However,  the  Government  must  maintain  a \nrigorous oversight role with regard to accreditation and monitoring of quality and relevance of \nprivate  HEIs.  The  Project  will  lay  the  foundations  for  the  eventual  unified  regulation  and \nsupervision  of  public  and  private  HEIs.  The  Project  will  assess  viable  options  based  on \ninternational best practice, and assist MOE in developing (i) policy and regulatory systems \n(including mechanisms for monitoring) for higher education subsector, (ii) accreditation criteria \nto be applied to private HEIs, and (iii) a quality auditing system. \n \n2.  Output 2: Enhanced Relevance and Capacity for Quality Improvement  \n \n37.  The Project will support the following suboutputs (i) enhanced relevance of courses, \ncurriculum, and teaching materials; (ii) strengthened quality assurance, accreditation, and credit \nsystem;  (iii)  enhanced  teaching  and  research  capacities  of  public  university  faculty;  \n(iv)  improved  teaching  and  learning  environment;  and  (v)  strengthened  regional  and \ninternational dimensions. \n \na.  Enhanced  Relevance  of  Courses,  Curriculum,  and  Teaching \nMaterials \n \n38.  The  Project  will  support  initial  tracer  studies  to  collect  benchmark  information  on \ngraduates and monitor their performance in the labor market, particularly for CU and SU, which \nrecently produced graduates with diploma and bachelor degrees for the first time since their \n ", "11 \nestablishment. Throughout the Project, periodic tracer studies will be undertaken to inform \nfuture development of all public and private HEIs, particularly the mix of faculties and courses to \nbe offered by the respective universities and the number of places offered within each faculty. \nThe Project will explore and develop new courses to reflect labor market survey results and \nrecommendations under the PPTA for the Strengthening Technical Vocational Education and \nTraining Project (footnote 13). Furthermore, to ensure external efficiency, the Project will help \npublic  universities  establish  alumni  associations,  and  introduce  career  orientation  and \ncounseling programs starting early in a student's course of study. It will also support expanded \ndialogue between universities and local employers to better align curriculum and pedagogical \napproaches with labor market needs. \n \n39.   In  connection  with  NESRS  implementation,  the  Project  will  support  the  reform  of \nundergraduate curriculum content by developing interdisciplinary common-core courses and \nassociated textbooks to be offered throughout different faculties of the three public universities, \nas well as faculty-specific curricula and lecture textbooks and materials. The introduction of \ncommon core courses will bring substantial efficiency gains and cost savings for all participating \nfaculties. The Project will include curriculum development workshops and international study \nvisits, where academic staff will be trained to enhance their skills in contemporary curriculum \ndesign, development of a curriculum framework for each of their respective faculties, and the \nuse of the revised and/or updated curriculum. At least 30% of staff or faculty members will be \nwomen  trained  in  curriculum  development  and  assessment.  Faculty-based  staff  will  then \ncontinue to develop faculty-specific lecture materials with associated delivery strategies. The \nProject will support development and/or updating, printing, and distribution of textbooks and \nlearning materials in the Lao language for approximately 15 subjects, prioritizing new materials \ndeveloped for interdisciplinary common-core courses and bridging programs for disadvantaged \nstudents with weaker academic backgrounds.  \n \nb.  Strengthened Quality Assurance, Accreditation, and Credit System \n \n40.   The  strengthened  QAC  at  MOE  will  be  mandated  as  the  key  accrediting  body  for \neducation programs in the Lao PDR. With support from the Project, DHE will cooperate with \nQAC to strengthen quality assurance, accreditation, credit systems for higher education, and \nrecognition of degrees and qualifications in accordance with international standards for higher \neducation. DHE will coordinate with QAC in developing university admission standards and \nbuilding capacity in the universities to set up entrance examinations. The Project will provide \nadvisory services, training, and necessary equipment to support capacity building of QAC. The \nProject will also help QAC and universities to develop systematic and fully standardized course \ncredit systems, which will facilitate student transfer between public and private HEIs, TVET \ngraduates' access to higher education opportunities, and employers' assessment of degree \nholders' qualifications.  \n \nc.  Enhanced Teaching and Research Capacities  \n \n41.   The Project will support the establishment of a central professional development unit \n(PDU) under DHE, which will be located at NUOL and linked to outreach PDUs established at \nCU and SU. The PDU staff will be seconded from DHE and NUOL during and beyond the \nproject  period  without  involving  any  additional  staff  salaries.  The  Project  will  provide \ninternational master\u2019s and doctoral degree programs comprising approximately 40 and 20 staff \nand faculty members respectively in three annual batches (approximately 10 for NUOL, 30 for \nCU, and 20 for SU in total), as well as 80 staff and faculty members for in-country master\u2019s \nprograms. In addition, the Project will provide international study tours and training programs for \n40 staff and faculty members, as well as a large number of in-country short-term staff and \n ", "12 \nfaculty  development  programs.  A  merit-based  and  transparent  selection  process  will  be \ndeveloped by the PDUs for staff and faculty to undertake international study or attend in-country \nactivities. Females will comprise 50% of all staff and faculty to be trained. To assess the efficacy \nof  staff  and  faculty  development  programs,  participant  feedback  methodologies  including \npostactivity assessment will be utilized. The Project will include provisions to invite foreign \nscholars and/or professionals to give advice on academic program development and review, \nteaching  support,  e-learning  approaches,  university\u2013industry  linkage,  and  research \nmethodology and publication. Foreign scholars will foster the long-term relationships between \nforeign and Lao universities. The Project, through QAC and the central PDU, will develop and \nimplement an induction program for all new academic staff. The staff and faculty development \nstrategies and plan are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n42.  As an integral part of international degree programs for staff and faculty members, the \nProject will pilot a matching scholarship grant scheme with 50:50 matching between the project \nand  partner  universities,  which  include  any  suitable  foreign  universities  willing  to  provide \npostgraduate (master\u2019s and doctoral) degree program scholarships for staff and faculty members \nof the three public universities. This scheme is expected to significantly expand the number of \nscholarships to be offered under the Project. Females will comprise at least 50% of the pilot \nmatching scholarship program. The PDU will be responsible for finalizing selection criteria for the \nmatching scholarship scheme, assisting participating Lao universities in identifying international \npartner universities, monitoring the implementation and results, and preparing an evaluation.15 \nStaff benefiting from scholarships or grants will be required to sign a bond. The fund flow diagram \nfor a matching scholarship grant scheme is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n43.  The Project will support the promotion of research capacity of faculty members of public \nuniversities.  The  NUOL  Research  Coordination  Committee  will  be  upgraded  to  a  national \nresearch center to help the university faculties at NUOL, CU, and SU formulate proposals for \nresearch grants to the Government and a range of funding agencies, including the private \nsector. The Project will develop a training scheme to improve the publication writing skills of \nacademic staff and to devise course modules on academic research skills development for \ninclusion  in  undergraduate  and  graduate  programs,  through  consulting  services  and  well-\nestablished academic publishing companies.  \n \nd.  Improved Teaching and Learning Environment  \n \n44.  To improve the teaching and learning environment and in accordance with the NESRS, \nwhich  places  high  priority  on  the  development  of  e-libraries,  the  Project  will  support  the \nestablishment and development of ICT-based teaching and learning centers at NUOL, CU, and \nSU, rather than focusing investment on the development of traditional libraries, or financing \nprocurement of discrete packages of information technology systems. Each learning center will \ntypically have about 100\u2013200 networked computers with internet access. It will enable the \ncreation of an e-resource centre or e-library (including access to computers with high-speed \ninternet, access to e-reference and journals, and an on-line network linking the three public \nuniversities and DHE) where students and staff are able to access up-to-date and extensive \nmaterials, bypassing the need for development of a traditional library. Effectiveness of student \nlearning activities will be greatly enhanced, as the network can be used for writing assignments, \nresearching information from the internet, pursuing distance study programs, accessing course \nmaterials,  accessing  references  available  on-line,  submitting  assignments  by  email,  and \n                                                 \n15  During the PPTA, several universities in Australia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Viet Nam confirmed \ntheir participation in the scheme and pledged initial total contributions of approximately $1 million equivalent.  \n ", "13 \ncommunicating with lecturers. Upon establishment of the ICT-based teaching and learning \ncenters  during  the  second  year  of  project  implementation,  a  related  ICT  package  will  be \nprocured as a 4-year leasing contract that provides for the replacement of computers on a 2-\nyear cycle, including technical and pedagogical support by suppliers.  \n \n45.  To improve and upgrade the teaching and learning environment at CU, the Project will \nsupport  development  of  the  campus  and  facilities.  Project  support  will  focus  on  fully  and \nintensively utilizing the current 66 hectare campus. The Project will develop basic infrastructure \nsuch  as  road,  water,  and  power  supply  systems.  The  Project  will  also  develop  facilities, \n(including  civil  works,  equipment,  and  furniture),  one  multipurpose  central  building  for  the \nestablishment of the ICT-based teaching and learning center, two faculty and department office \nblocks, two faculty housing blocks, one science laboratory building with equipment (for physics, \nbiology, and chemistry), and one auditorium-conference hall. This concentrated approach for \ncampus and facilities development will minimize implications for operation and maintenance \nrelated costs and environmental impacts. \n \ne.  Strengthened Regional and International Links \n \n46.  The Project will expand and strengthen academic and student exchange programs with \nneighboring countries, and support MOE to strengthen its cooperation with the Southeast Asia \nMinisters of Education Organization (SEAMEO), in particular the SEAMEO-Regional Center for \nHigher  Education  and  Development,  and  other  existing  similar  networks.  The  Project  will \nencourage female participation in such international exchange programs, whereby at least 50% \nof faculty members or students will be women. Once the standardized credit transfer system is \ninstituted,  the  Project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  Lao  universities  to  expand  student \nexchange relationships with universities in neighboring countries. In addition, the Project will \nhelp each of the three public universities to identify two to three international twinning programs, \nand reach agreements with foreign universities. Furthermore, the Project will provide advisory \nservices through visiting scholars and/or professionals to promote existing and new academic \nexchange  agreements.  Universities  will  be  encouraged  to  seek  relationships  with  quality, \ncommercially oriented international professional training organizations by financing membership \nfees. Academic and student exchange programs and international partnerships must be subject \nto effectiveness review.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Increased Equity and Access in Higher Education \n \n47.   Output  3  includes  (i)  improved  targeted  selection  criteria  and  procedures  for  quota \nstudents, and (ii) increased enrollment capacity at CU.  \n \na.  Improved  Targeted  Selection  Criteria  and  Procedures  for  Quota \nStudents \n \n48.  The Project will support the reform of the admission system. The percentage of quota \nstudents (who are exempted from fees and provided with living allowances) will be reduced from \nroughly 50% to 20% in a phased manner from 2011 to 2015 to enable more effective targeting \nto ensure that the most disadvantaged candidates are identified to receive increased support. \nMany of the current quota students are not poor and disadvantaged students from ethnic \ngroups. Instead, the quota system benefits students from affluent families who can pay tuition \nand other fees. The Project will support the high-level task force on student admission to be \nlocated at MOE by providing its operating costs, and establishing standardized criteria for quota \nstudents  (giving  priority  to  female  students  from  ethnic  groups).  Task  force  membership \ncomprises  director  generals  of  DHE,  MOE's  departments  of  finance  and  personnel;  and \n ", "14 \nuniversity presidents concerned. Appropriate advisory support with regard to choice of study \nprograms for quota students will be incorporated in the selection process; currently this is a \ncritical constraint to success of the quota system. In addition, the Project will develop pre-entry \nskills tests to more accurately assess the competency of quota students. Students not meeting \nthe  required  minimum  entry  standards  will  be  required  to  undertake  a  purpose-designed \nacademic skills upgrading program, to help them reach the academic standard required to gain \nentry to a 1st year degree or diploma program.  \n \nb.  Increased Enrollment Capacity at Champasak University \n \n49.  The  Project  will  provide  a  foundation  for  incremental  expansion  of  enrollment  and \nprograms  by  enhancing  CU's  enrollment  capacity.  To  fill  the  gap  between  the  university\u2019s \nexpected enrollment growth and admission capacity, the Project will provide (i) five multipurpose \nbuildings with furniture, each comprising 12 classrooms (a total of 60 classrooms); (ii) two student \ndormitories with furniture (female and male), each accommodating 300 students; and (iii) six \nseparate female and male toilet and washroom facility blocks. The additional classroom places \ncreated can absorb students graduating from upper secondary education who at present need to \nseek jobs or enroll in technical and vocational institutions for tertiary education. Special attention \n(e.g., boarding fee exemption) will be given to poor and female students of ethnic origins in \navailing of the expanded student dormitories. By 2015, females will comprise 50% of CU students. \n \n4.  Output 4: Effective Project Management and Implementation  \n \n50.  To  facilitate  project  management  and  implementation,  the  Project  will  provide \nequipment, vehicles, and other necessary materials and furniture for DHE and CU, as well as a \ncore package of equipment for NUOL and SU. The Project will also provide a package of \ninternational and national consultants (including administrative assistants and accounts on a \nneed basis), who will help DHE and participating three public universities implement the Project \nin a timely fashion and with good quality results. \n \nC.  Special Features  \n \n51.  ICT  Teaching  and  Learning  Centers,  and  ICT  Leasing.  The  Project  will  develop \nmultipurpose, ICT-based teacher and learning centers and their network at each of the three \npublic universities, rather than focusing investment on the development of traditional libraries or \nfinancing procurement of discrete packages of information technology systems. The ICT teaching \nand learning center is regarded as an effective and efficient way to raise the standards of teaching \nand learning in the universities. Maintenance and technical support will be provided on an on-call \nbasis. High-speed and high-quality internet access will be provided on a continuous basis. The \nselected supplier will customize a platform for use by the universities, and provide technical and \npedagogical support by supplying technicians and experts in e-learning over a specified period \nuntil university staff develop sufficient skills to operate the system independently. In the NESRS, \nthe Government identifies the development of e-libraries as a priority. In addition, the Project \nincludes measures to increase cost-recovery such as introducing tuition fees for regular nonquota \ncourses, charging dormitory fees, and promoting other income-generation activities. The Project \nwill help MOE and the universities formulate budgetary plans to sustainably finance operation and \nmaintenance, and periodic upgrading of ICT resources after project completion. These plans will \ninclude  allocating  a  portion  of  increased  university  revenues  from  enhanced  cost-recovery \nmeasures introduced under the Project. MOE and participating universities will seek internet \nproviders that can offer low-cost services to education institutions.  \n \n ", "15 \n52.  Quality Assurance, Accreditation, and Recognition. The Project will develop a national \nsystem of quality assurance and accreditation (currently lacking due to inadequate funding and \nhuman resources), including helping MOE develop a quality audit manual. Development of this \nsystem  will  involve  close  dialogue  and  cooperation  with  the  central  QAC  as  well  as  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations University Network Quality Assurance. It will be supported \nby consulting services provided under the Project and technical dialogue with the Asia-Pacific \nQuality  Network  and  SEAMEO-Regional  Center  for  Higher  Education  and  Development.  An \noutreach QAC office will be maintained within each of the three public universities. \n \n53.  Matching Scholarship Grant Scheme. The Project will pilot a new scheme of matching \nscholarship grants (50:50 matching between the Project and partner universities), as an initiative \nin public\u2013private partnership. For this purpose, the Project's $2 million grant will be matched with a \n$2 million equivalent scholarship grant from any partner universities. Partner universities will be \nany public and private foreign universities willing to provide master degree program scholarships \nto administrative or academic staff of the three public universities. The project fund can be directly \nmatched with contributions from partner universities or channeled through intermediary agencies \nthat help PDUs coordinate with partner universities. This scheme is expected to significantly \nincrease the number and amount of scholarships offered under the Project. The central PDU at \nNUOL  will  be  responsible  for  finalizing  selection  criteria  for  the  matching  scholarship  grant \nscheme, and will assist participating universities in identifying partner universities.  \n  \nD.  Project Investment Plan  \n \n54.  The project investment cost is estimated at $28.8 million, including physical and price \ncontingencies, taxes, and duties of $1.6 million to be financed by the Government (Table 1, and \nAppendix 4). The foreign exchange cost is $17.2 million, or 60% of the total cost. The local \ncurrency cost, including taxes and duties, is $11.6 million equivalent, or 40% of the total cost. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n55.  ADB will provide a grant of $24,800,000 from its Special Funds resources to cover 86% \nof the project cost. For the balance of $4.00 million, the Government will finance $2.00 million \n(7.0% of the project cost), while partner foreign universities will cover $2.00 million, or 7.0% of \nthe project cost (Table 2, and Appendix 4).  \n \nTable 1: Tentative Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management  \n \n56.  MOE will be the Executing Agency. A project steering committee will provide overall \nguidance to the Project and support cross-agency policy dialogue. The MOE vice minister in \ncharge of higher education will chair the committee, which will comprise representatives of MOE \nand the three concerned public universities, as well as representatives from the Ministry of \nFinance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Planning and Investment, and Office of the \nPrime Minister. Within DHE, a (i) project coordination unit headed by the DHE director general, \nas project director, will be established to facilitate policy dialogue across MOE departments and \nthe participating universities and supervise and oversee project implementation; and (ii) a DHE \nproject implementation unit (D-PIU) headed by the DHE deputy director general, as project \nmanager, will be established to implement and supervise central project activities including \nconsolidation of project reporting and review of withdrawal applications for endorsement by the \nMOE's  Department  of  Finance.  MOE  departments  and  institutions  will  be  responsible  for \nactivities that fall within their area of responsibility. PIUs will be established in each participating \nuniversity (NUOL, CU and SU), headed by the respective universities' vice presidents as project \nmanagers to coordinate with the D-PIU and concerned provincial authorities in implementing \nand supervising the Project, including procurement activities, monitoring, and reporting. The \nproject management structure is in Appendix 5. To implement the staff and faculty development \nstrategies and plan, a PDU will be established under DHE, which will be located at NUOL, and \nlinked to outreach PDUs established at CU and SU and D-PIU. The MOE vice minister and DHE \ndirector general, together with the Center for Integrated Education (formerly the Gender and \nEthnic Groups Education Unit), will be responsible for overseeing implementation of the gender \nand ethnic groups action plan.  \n   \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n57.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years from January 2010 to December 2015, to \nbe consistent with the final target year of the ESDF, 2009\u20132015. Both central and provincial \ngovernment authorities have assured that adequate budgetary provision for the Project will be \nincluded  in  the  fiscal  years  from  2009/10  to  2015/16.  The  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 6.  \n  \n3.  Procurement \n \n58.   All procurement to be financed under the ADB grant will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The D-PIU will be \nresponsible for all procurement, except for civil works, equipment, furniture, and vehicles at CU, \nwhich will be done by the CU PIU, in close consultation with the D-PIU. Procurement of goods \n ", "17 \nsuch  as  computers  and  laboratory  equipment  will  use  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures if more than $1.0 million; national competitive bidding if $1 million or less, but more \nthan $100,000 equivalent; or shopping if less than $100,000 equivalent. Civil works will use \ninternational competitive bidding if more than $2.0 million; and national competitive bidding if \nless than $2 million, but more than $100,000. Prior review will be used in the procurement \nprocesses. The procurement plan, including indicative procurement packages, is in Appendix 7. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n59.   The Project will be supported by consultant services mobilized via three modalities. First, \nthe Project will engage a firm to provide 220 person-months of consulting services (95 person-\nmonths  international  and  125  person-months  national),  which  will  be  selected  using  the \nsimplified technical proposal and quality- and cost-based selection method, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The quality- \nand cost-based selection weighting will follow the standard quality-cost ratio of 80:20. This \npackage of consulting services will provide technical support for the Project as well as build \nlonger-term  local  capacities  for  planning,  management,  research,  and  delivery  of  higher \neducation.  Consulting  services  will  span  a  broad  array  of  expertise,  including  (i)  strategic \nplanning, project management, and monitoring; (ii) governance and management of higher \neducation; (iii) higher education financing; (iv) higher education quality assurance; (v) curriculum \nand textbook development; (vi) human resources and professional development; (vii) research \ncapacity building; (viii) ICT-based teaching and learning; (ix) higher education MIS development; \n(x) campus and facilities development, and equipment improvement; (xi) gender and social \ndevelopment; (xii) environment; (xiii) procurement; and (xiv) project financial management. In \naddition to the firm that will augment consulting services in specific and needs-tailored areas, \ninternational scholars and/or professionals (a total of 70 person-months) will be invited as short-\nterm  consultants  on  an  individual  basis  to  assist  participating  universities  in  developing \nacademic and research programs and in teaching support. The Project will also locally recruit \nadministrative assistants and accountants on an individual basis as needed to help the PIUs \nwith project administration, accounting, and other tasks including reporting. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix C. Any assets purchased will be \nprocured using ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), and upon \ncompletion of the Project, will be turned over to MOE.  \n \n    5.  Staff and Faculty Development \n \n60.   The Project will provide international master\u2019s and doctoral degree programs and in-\ncountry  master\u2019s  degree  programs  for  DHE  staff,  and  staff  and  faculty  of  the  three  public \nuniversities (NUOL, CU, and SU). In addition, the Project will provide international study tours and \ntraining programs for staff and faculty members, as well as a large number of in-country short-\nterm staff and faculty development programs. The PDU, in coordination with outreach PDUs at \nCU and SU and D-PIU, will select the candidates for staff and faculty development programs \n(including the matching scholarship grant scheme) based on the merit-based and transparent \nselection criteria and process to be developed by the PDUs for Lao staff and faculty members to \nundertake international study or attend in-country activities. Staff benefiting from scholarships or \ngrants for postgraduate degree programs will be required to sign a bond. The Project will execute \nagreements  with  all  candidates  receiving  scholarships  or  grants  for  undertaking  foreign \npostgraduate  degrees  and  local  master\u2019s  degrees  to  ensure  that  scholarship  recipients  will \ncontinue working with the same ministry or institution for at least 5 years after completing a foreign \ndegree or local master\u2019s degree program. The scholarship summary and indicative selection \ncriteria are in Appendix 8.  \n \n ", "18 \n    6.  Advance Action \n \n61.  One package of consulting services will be selected using advance recruitment action. \nMOE will carry out advance action for recruiting consulting services up to the stage of evaluating \ntechnical and financial proposals. MOE may not sign the contract with the winning firm before \nthe financing agreement becomes effective. ADB's support of advance action does not commit \nADB to approve the Project or to finance the recruitment costs.  \n \n    7.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n62.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MOE.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n63.  In  addition  to  the  standard  ADB  requirements  to  deter  corruption  and  increase \ntransparency, the Government will be required to disclose information about various project \nmatters,  including  procurement  related  to  the  Project,  on  MOE's  website.  With  regard  to \nprocurement, the website will include a list of participating bidders, names of the winning bidder, \nbasic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of contracts awarded, and list of goods \nand  services  procured.  Information  regarding  the  partner  universities  in  the  matching \nscholarship grant scheme will be posted on the website. A grievance redresses body will be \nestablished  at  MOE,  NUOL,  CU,  and  SU  to  (i)  review  and  address  grievances  of  project \nstakeholders, or any person responsible for carrying out the Project; and (ii) set the threshold \ncriteria and procedures for handling such grievances, for proactively responding to them, and for \nproviding the stakeholders with notice of the chosen mechanism/action. \n \n    8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n64.   MOE will establish an imprest account for the Project in dollars at the Bank of Lao DPR. \nThe advance to the imprest account will be no more than a 6-month projected disbursement to \nbe financed through the imprest account or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The \nimprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Statement of expenditure \nprocedures may be used to reimburse contracts not exceeding $50,000 per payment and to \nliquidate advances made into the imprest account in accordance with the grant's financial \ncovenants. MOE and the Ministry of Finance will coordinate the timely release of funds.  \n \n  9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n65.  MOE, on behalf of the Government, will maintain separate records and accounts for the \nProject to identify goods and services financed from the grant proceeds. All project accounts \nincluding  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  as  part  of  the  regular  audit  by  the \nNational Audit Authority, using international accounting and auditing standards in accordance \nwith the provisions of the grant agreement. The auditor's report and copies of the certified \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements,  including  auditor's  opinion  on  the  use  of  grant \nproceeds, and compliance with grant covenants, will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 \n ", "19 \nmonths after the close of each fiscal year in English language. A separate audit opinion will be \nissued on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures. \n \n66.   DHE will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit them to ADB \nwithin 30 days of each quarter. The reports will be submitted in a format acceptable to ADB and \ninclude progress made against established targets, problems encountered during the previous \nquarter, steps taken to resolve disputes and problems, compliance with grant covenants, and \nproposed project activities for the succeeding quarter. Within 3 months after physical completion \nof the Project, MOE will submit to ADB a project completion report providing details of project \nimplementation and accomplishments. \n \n    10.  Project Performance, Monitoring, and Evaluation. \n \n67.  MOE will monitor project achievements to evaluate implementation and development \nimpacts at various stages of the project cycle. The higher education master plan, 2010\u20132020, \nunder preparation, will develop a higher education development monitoring framework using the \nresult-based  monitoring  indicators  in  accordance  with  the  ESDF  targets.  The  project \nperformance monitoring will focus on assessing the degree of fulfillment in the monitoring \nindicators to be developed under the higher education master plan. The project performance, \nmonitoring, and evaluation system will be based on the gender targets and indicators in the \ndesign and monitoring framework, and gender and ethnic groups action plan, as well as other \nsex-disaggregated data and analysis. \n \n    11.  Project Review \n \n68.   The Government and ADB will conduct semiannual reviews of the Project. The reviews \nwill assess progress in each output area, identify difficulties or constraints, and help determine \nways to overcome them. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review of the \nProject in the last quarter of year 3 of project implementation. The midterm review will (i) assess \nproject performance against targets and benchmarks, (ii) identify and recommend necessary \nchanges in the project design and implementation arrangements, and (iii) review compliance with \ngrant covenants. It will inform planning for the second half of the Project. The findings will be \ndiscussed  at  the  midterm  seminar  to  be  attended  by  MOE  leadership  and  senior  staff, \nrepresentatives of government ministries and agencies concerned, the consultants, and ADB.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Expected Benefits and Impacts \n \n69.  Direct  Beneficiaries.  The  direct  beneficiaries  will  be  the  nearly  400,000  university \ngraduates of the improved and expanded higher education system, including 300,000 at NUOL, \n53,000 in CU, and 47,000 at SU. The benefits will primarily accrue from increased quality and \nexpanded classroom and dormitory space. The Project will support a 25% increase in academic \nstaff with postgraduate degrees from 538 to 678. The university system will be linked by intranet \nproviding access for e-learning and internet for all students, with ICT investments including \nincreasing the number of terminals at CU plus NUOL from 170 to 500 and adding an additional \n200 terminals at NUOL. CU will receive 60 new classrooms, one laboratory building with 12 \nrooms, and 30 dormitory rooms for 600 students, increasing dormitory capacity from 200 to 800 \nstudents. Other facilities include an auditorium and conference center, e-learning and student \ncenter, faculty and administrative offices, water supply, faculty housing, and toilet and washing \nfacilities for females and males on campus. Segregated toilets and washing facilities for males \nand females will be built in the dorm area at CU. Offices, housing, and dormitories will be \n ", "20 \nfurnished. The Project will print and distribute textbooks covering 15 titles for 50,000 students. \nThe textbooks will be loaned to the students and returned each year. The current 50% quota \nscholarships reach few of the disadvantaged and poor; the amount fails to cover student living \nexpenses.  Reducing  the  quota  to  20%  and  increasing  the  living  expense  allowance  with \ntransparent targeting will enable uptake by disadvantaged ethnic groups and women selected. \n \n70.  Economic Benefits. By improving access to and particularly the quality and relevance of \nhigher education, the Project will have important economic benefits for individuals and the overall \neconomy. Particularly in economies characterized by rapid growth and transformation, completion \nof higher education is associated with higher individual wages as well as enhanced capacity to \nrespond to new economic opportunities in emerging modern sectors. The country\u2019s rapid growth \nand economic transformation has meant that demand for human capital has outstripped the \nsupply of tertiary education graduates, resulting in a wage premium for graduates from higher \nversus  secondary  education.  Investments  in  expanding  the  enrollment  capacity  at  CU  will \nincrease the number of higher education graduates flowing into the labor market annually, while \nthe impact of improved quality and relevance of education will enhance the labor market returns to \ngraduates of all three universities. The Project's economic internal rate of return of 18% was \ncalculated using very conservative assumptions.16 Increasing project cost or decreasing project \nbenefit by 10% yields little change. Postponing project benefits by 1 year reduces the economic \ninternal rate of return to 13% (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n71.  The Project supports long-term and sustainable poverty reduction. Currently, the thin \nlayer of highly educated young adults\u2014less than 1% of the labor force\u2014detracts from the \ncountry\u2019s ability to attract foreign direct investment. Foreign direct investment based on low \nwages alone does not lead to sustainable poverty reduction, therefore labor productivity must be \nincreased to penetrate higher-value-added sectors. The National Growth and Poverty Reduction \nStrategy notes the need to increase the proportion of university and vocational school graduates \nto ensure sustainability. In addition to enhancing the efficiency of state funding for education \nand supporting increased education access, relevance, and quality in the public university \nsystem, the Project will strengthen the regulatory environment and quality assurance for private \nhigher education, magnifying its short- and longer-term economic impacts. The enhanced cost \nrecovery and other reforms promoted under the Project will have important indirect economic \nbenefits by improving sustainability of the entire education system, including basic education.  \n \n72.  In the context of increasing demand for rapid expansion of higher education systems, \nquality, equity, and sustainable financing of the expanded system can become a concern, \nparticularly in low-income developing member countries such as the Lao PDR. The Project is \nstrategically designed to support the Government to pursue, in a step-by-step manageable and \ncomprehensive  way,  the  expanded  and  improved  higher  education  system.  The  Project's \nstrategic approach aims to help minimize the risk of quantitative expansion of higher education \nundermining quality and equity in higher education. Through cost-recovery, cost-sharing, and \npartnership measures, it also aims to minimize the risk of increased higher education financing \neroding public financing for lower education subsectors, such as basic education. The economic \nand financial sustainability analysis is in Appendix 9. \n \n73.  Social and Gender Benefits. A poverty and social assessment was conducted during \nthe PPTA, and a summary poverty reduction and social strategy was prepared (Appendix 10). \n                                                 \n16  The benefit stream starts in year 4 with revenue from only 25% of the graduates and 50% in year 5, taking into \naccount male and female labor force participation and unemployment rates. The monthly wage premium for improved \nuniversity education is assumed to be $12. \n ", "21 \nThe Project is designed to benefit the poor, women, and ethnic groups, especially female \nstudents from ethnic groups, through (i) the revised student quota system to increase the ratio \nof  female  quota  students  from  ethnic  groups,  and  (ii)  the  provision  of  increased  living \nallowances to disadvantaged quota students. In addition, due to expanded female dormitory \naccommodation and female amenities blocks, the number of female students enrolled at CU will \nincrease from 1,713 (35% of total enrollments) to 4,000 by 2015 (50%). Further, the Project will \nsupport at least 30% female participation in all training courses, and at least 50% in international \nexchange programs. Recruitment and training of faculty members and staff will give preference \nto women from ethnic groups. A gender and ethnic group analyses and action plan is in \nAppendix 11.  \n \n74.  Institutional Benefits. DHE and participating universities will benefit from the Project \nthrough policy and administrative reform for higher education. The Project will initiate major \nefforts to improve management through institutional capacity building for DHE and participating \nuniversities, especially CU and SU. DHE staff will be trained to upgrade their planning and \nmanagement  skills  and  knowledge  for  overall  strategic  and  master  planning  and  policy \ndevelopment, as well as for oversight of operations of the higher education system, including \nprivate HEIs. The governance system and management capacity at public universities will be \nstrengthened by establishing clearly defined governance and management structures at each \nuniversity.  For  private  HEIs,  the  regulatory  framework  and  accreditation  criteria  will  be \ndeveloped and applied. The Project will enhance capacity for data collection, management, and \nanalysis through the development of an MIS to enhance management efficiency throughout the \nhigher  education  system,  i.e.,  DHE  and  each  public  HEI.  The  academic  profile  of  the \nparticipating  universities  will  be  upgraded  by  international  and  in-country  staff  and  faculty \ndevelopment programs, which will eventually strengthen the capacity of faculty members to \nintegrate teaching with research activities.  \n \n75.   Resettlement Impacts. The Project does not include any campus or site developments \nfor NUOL and SU. The campus and facilities development of CU, involving construction of basic \ncampus infrastructure and new facilities such as faculty classrooms and multipurpose buildings, \nwill be concentrated on the existing site of 66 hectares, where no households will be relocated \nand no households use agricultural land.  \n \n76.  Environmental Impacts. The Project will improve water supply, power supply, drainage, \nand sanitation service as part of the campus and facilities development of CU. The science \nlaboratories will not produce any industrial hazardous waste as they will be used only for \nteaching, with minimum disposal of solid waste. However, the construction contractor must keep \nnoise and dust within locally acceptable levels, as well as manage fill, excavated material, and \nsolid waste in a way that does not create a permanent impact. During operations, the water \nsupply must meet national drinking water quality standards to ensure water users are not at risk. \nMitigation and monitoring measures in the initial environmental examination (IEE) are designed \nto address these issues. The Project shows no significant adverse environmental impact and is \nassessed  as  category  B  (nonsensitive),  as  defined  in  ADB's  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003). The IEE is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \nB.  Assumptions, Risks, and Mitigating Measures \n \n77.  Governance Risks. A primary risk for the higher education system is that the envisaged \nuniversity autonomy will not materialize fully, that it will not be accompanied by an independent \nuniversity  governance  structure  and  flexibility  in  financial  mechanisms  to  enable  public \nuniversities to reach regional standards in teaching and learning, and research. This risk may be \n ", "22 \nmitigated through (i) the ESDF annual planning and policy dialogue process, (ii) the ongoing \nreview and assessment process by senior MOE officials and wider stakeholders to secure broad \nsupport of the reform agenda, and (iii) advisory support from ADB and other development \nagencies for ongoing policy studies and related reforms.  \n \n78.  Accountability Risks. A potential risk is that the newly established QAC at MOE may \nnot be able to develop accountable quality assurance and accreditation systems. This risk can \nbe mitigated by (i) appointing qualified staff at QAC; (ii) extending advisory services and training \nto support capacity building of QAC under the Project; and (iii) strengthening ongoing dialogue \nand cooperation between QAC and the Asia-Pacific Quality Network, the ASEAN University \nNetwork  Quality  Assurance,  and  SEAMEO-Regional  Center  for  Higher  Education  and \nDevelopment.  \n \n79.  Political  Risks.  Quota  students  are  not  charged  tuition  fees  and  receive  living \nallowances. The Project intends to restructure the quota student admission system to improve \ntargeting of poor and disadvantaged students so that overall budget allocation in the form of \ntuition subsidies and living allowances will be more equitable. This initiative may encounter \npolitical  difficulties  with  resistance  from  those  who  would  lose  privileges  to  enter  public \nuniversities, although most provinces have indicated their in-principle agreement to reduce the \nnumber of quota students. To mitigate this risk, the Project will support continued dialogue on \nstudent  admission  reform  between  public  university  presidents  and  concerned  provincial \nauthorities by strengthening the university council mechanism and functions, promoting public \ncampaign, and reducing the number of quota students in a phased manner over 6 years.  \n \n80.  Cost-Recovery Risks. Public universities may not be able to recover costs of their \noperations including salaries of their staff and faculty members and operation and maintenance \nof the facilities and equipment under the Project, such as ICT-based teaching and learning \ncenters. This risk is mitigated by (i) prime ministerial decree enabling public universities to \ncharge tuition fees for regular nonquota students who will comprise approximately 80% of \nuniversity intakes by 2015; (ii) a phased decrease in the share of quota students exempt from \ntuition-related and dormitory fees; (iii) advisory support to increase university revenues through \nincome-generating activities; and (iv) formulation of budgetary plans to sustainably finance \noperation and maintenance, and periodic upgrading of ICT resources after project completion, \nwhich will include allocating a portion of increased university revenues from enhanced cost-\nrecovery measures introduced under the Project.  \n \n81.  Matching Scholarships. Although several foreign universities have expressed interest \nin  participating  in  the  matching  grant  scholarship  scheme  with  pledged  contributions,  total \ncontributions  from  partner  foreign  universities  may  not  reach  $2  million  equivalent  in  the \nscheme. This risk would be mitigated by advisory support to the PDU in finalizing selection \ncriteria for the matching scholarship scheme, and in helping participating universities identify \npartner foreign universities. The PDU will also solicit scholarships from host institutions of \ninternational visiting scholars to be recruited individually under the Project.  \n \n82.   Project Implementation Risks. A further risk may be represented by MOE\u2019s limited \ncapacity to manage and implement new policies envisaged under the Project. The PIUs of DHE \nNUOL, CU, and SU will implement the Project based on agreed policy and planning directions. \nThis risk can be further mitigated by (i) extensive advisory support for subsector planning and \nmanagement, and (ii) consulting services to facilitate implementation of the legislative and \nregulatory framework to be developed during project implementation.  \n \n ", "23 \nC.  Financial Sustainability \n \n83.  The sustainability of project benefits can by analyzed through two mechanisms. The first is \na static analysis that ignores the potential impact of systemic reforms to be promoted by the \nProject. This analysis assesses total incremental costs incurred by the Government and three \nparticipating public universities during project implementation and following completion as a share \nof total government budgeting for education. Analysis was conducted for a range of scenarios. \nEven for the low-case scenario, where the total education budget remains stagnant from 2010 to \n2015, the Government\u2019s annual commitment is projected to remain below 0.38% of the total \neducation budget throughout the 6-year life of the Project, which is considered to be sustainable.17 \nThe incremental Government recurrent cost burden associated with the Project annually following \nproject completion is estimated at less than 0.36% of the total education budget, which is also \ndeemed affordable.  \n \n84.  Second,  the  projected  impact  of  reforms  promoted  by  the  Project  was  considered, \nfocusing on two core reforms. The first of these is the phased decrease in the share of quota \nstudents  (who  are  provided  living  allowances  while  being  exempt  from  tuition-related  and \ndormitory fees) from roughly 50% of total enrollments prior to the Project to 20% by project \ncompletion in 2015, while ensuring that remaining quota spaces are targeted to students from \ndisadvantaged families. The second and complementary core reform is the phased introduction \nof tuition for all mainstream courses (exempting noted poor quota students) to reach a level \nequivalent to average fees formerly charged for special courses, thereby unifying all course \nofferings under a single system. Growing demand for fee-based special courses at public \nuniversities and the rapid growth of an array of generally more costly private higher education \nprograms demonstrate willingness-to-pay, thus indicating that such cost-recovery is viable. For \na range of indicative parameters, enhanced cost-recovery and more targeted provision of quota \nsubsidies are projected to substantially decrease the Government's budget burden. Freed-up \nresources could be redeployed to fund operation and maintenance and further investments to \nenhance education quality. The reforms would contribute to increased system efficacy and \nefficiency, while improving equity. Finally, in addition to ensuring the sustainability of project \ninterventions, they will also help ensure that the expansion of higher education can be achieved \nwithout drawing state resources from lower tiers of education, thereby supporting sustainable \nand equitable development of the education sector as a whole. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n85.   In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. The Government will undertake the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i)  Establish university councils at CU and SU ensuring that representatives from \nlocal  government,  private  sector,  and  cultural  and  related  social  sector  will \ncomprise  at  least  30%  membership  of  university  councils  of  three  public \nuniversities (NUOL, CU, and SU) by 2013. \n(ii)  Introduce tuition fees for regular nonquota courses amounting to (a) 50% of the \naverage tuition fee charged for the special courses starting from 2011; (b) 75% \nby 2013; and (c) 100% by 2015. \n                                                 \n17  Adding Government contributions to ADB's Basic Education Sector Development Program, the combined share \nremains at only 0.7% of the total education budget in the low-case scenario, which remains affordable. \n ", "24 \n(iii)  Reduce the share of quota students from (a) 50% to 30% by 2013, and (b) 30% \nto 20% by 2015, with more effective targeting to ensure increased enrollment of \nfemales, ethnic groups, and poor students. \n(iv)  Promulgate  (a)  ministerial  decision  for  implementation  in  2011  to  introduce \nrevised  increased  dormitory  fees  for  regular  nonquota  students;  and  (b) \nuniversity  regulations  for  NUOL,  CU,  and  SU  for  implementation  in  2011  to \nintroduce improved benefit structure for their respective staff members. \n(v)  Upgrade the Research Coordination Committee at NUOL into a national research \ncenter within 6 months from grant effectiveness. The national research center will \nassist the university faculties at NUOL, CU, and SU to formulate proposals to the \nGovernment and a range of funding agencies, including the private sector, for \nresearch grants. \n(vi)  Execute  agreements  with  all  candidates  receiving  scholarships  or  grants  for \nundertaking foreign degrees and local master\u2019s degrees to ensure scholarship \nrecipients  continue  working  with  the  same  ministry  or  institution  for  at  least  \n5 years after completing a foreign degree or local master\u2019s degree program. \n(vii)  Ensure, through MOE, that any project-funded construction of campus facilities \nwill be carried out on government-owned land, with valid legal title free from all \nencumbrances and controversies.  \n(viii)  Provide counterpart funds for project implementation on time. The Government \nwill also make timely submission of annual budgetary appropriation requests for \nthe higher education subsector and ensure prompt disbursement of appropriate \nfunds for the Project throughout the implementation period.  \n(ix)  Ensure  through  MOE  that  ICT  resources,  developed  under  the  Project,  are \noperated and maintained and periodically upgraded after project completion in \naccordance with the budgetary plan developed under the Project.  \n(x)  Ensure and cause MOE to ensure that the PDU develops (a) a merit-based and \ntransparent selection criteria for staff and faculty to undertake foreign degree or \ntraining courses to be financed by the Project, including the 50:50 matching \nscholarship  grant  scheme;  and  (b)  result-based  monitoring  and  evaluation \nprogram based on the postactivity assessment system.  \n(xi)  Ensure to implement by 2013 (a) policy and regulatory system developed under \nthe Project for effective regulation of both public and private HEIs, (b) application \nof accreditation criteria to public and private HEIs, and (c) application of a quality \nauditing system. \n(xii)  Ensure that the gender and ethnic groups action plan is fully implemented and \nmonitored in a timely manner in accordance with ADB's policies on gender and \ndevelopment18 and indigenous peoples,19 and adequate resources are allocated \nfor this purpose. In particular, ensure that (a) the student quota system is revised \nto increase the ratio of female quota students from ethnic groups; (b) the living \nallowances  to  disadvantaged  quota  students  are  increased;  and  (c)  special \npreference is given to women and ethnic groups when recruiting faculty members \nand staff for NUOL, CU, and SU. Women should comprise 40% of the university \ncouncils\u2019 membership, and at least 30% of all training and 50% of all scholarship \nrecipients of postgraduate degrees.  \n(xiii)  Ensure  that  the  site  selection,  design,  construction,  replacement  work,  and \noperation of facilities will be implemented in accordance with the Project\u2019s IEE, \nrelevant Government regulations and standards, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n ", "25 \n2002, including all environmental mitigation and monitoring measures provided \nunder the IEE; relevant clauses will be added in the construction contracts to this \neffect.  \n(xiv)  The Government will ensure, and will cause MOE to ensure, that (a) periodic \ninspections  of  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements are carried out; (b) relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \nare included in all bidding documents for the Project; (c) all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB \nto audit and examine the records and accounts of MOE and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project; \n(d) information regarding procurement, including a list of participating bidders, \nname of the winning bidder, and procedures adopted in awarding contracts, is \nposted on the MOE website; and (e) a grievance redress body is established at \nMOE,  NUOL,  CU,  and  SU  to  review  and  address  grievances  of  project \nstakeholders, or any person responsible for carrying out the Project; and set the \nthreshold criteria and procedures for handling such grievances, for proactively \nresponding to them, and for providing the stakeholders with notice of the chosen \nmechanism and/or action. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n86.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the grant not exceeding $24,800,000 to the Lao People's Democratic Republic from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the Strengthening Higher Education Project, on terms and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nC.

Overview. Studies that have assessed the baseline status of higher education in the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) include Asian Development Bank (ADB) planning \nand review documents and reports, and a range of other studies and reports originating from \ninternational and national organizations.1 The literature surveyed identifies a set of fundamental \nconstraints seen by most commentators to be inherent in the Lao higher education system. \nThese  include  lack  of  effective,  efficient,  and  accountable  management  and  administrative \nsystems at public sector universities; lack of data to support the higher education system; and \npoor coordination between public and private universities. In the area of relevance of higher \neducation training for the needs of the labor market, the lack of available data constrains the \nability to carry out long-term strategic planning for higher education. Public universities need to \nupdate their curriculum and learning materials, especially given recent changes introduced \nunder the National Education System Reform Strategy, 2006\u20132015. A particular need is to \nstandardize  and  raise  the  quality  of  the  curriculum  for  all  academic  and  technical  study \nprograms,  and  to  develop  appropriate  learning  materials  across  all  faculties  in  the  Lao \nlanguage. The research capacity of universities is also weak due to structural constraints, and \nlack of time and funding required to carry out research activities.  \n \n2.  The physical infrastructure and equipment of universities needs to upgraded to that of \nuniversities in neighboring countries, especially for libraries, science laboratories, and technical \nequipment. At Champasak University (CU), the development of basic infrastructure is urgently \nneeded  to  raise  it  to  the  standard  of  other  public  universities  within  the  country  and  in \nneighboring countries. The higher education system is characterized by low student enrollment \noverall,  and  lack  of  physical  capacity  to  expand  to  accommodate  planned  increases  in \nenrollment. Access opportunities for female and ethnic students is still limited, particularly for \nthose from more remote areas of the country. \n \n3.  A major concern articulated by all stakeholders is the need to significantly increase the \nqualifications of academic staff by implementing comprehensive staff development strategies. \nThe study programs provided by the public universities do not have a standardized credit point \nor credit transfer system, which means that determining the value of particular courses or \nprograms is difficult, and student transfers between faculties or institutions is almost impossible: \nthe system has no provision for recognizing prior learning. \n \n4.  Management and Governance. Management capacity in the higher education system \nin the Ministry of Education (MOE) and across the institutions is relatively underdeveloped. The \nmajor needs are in the areas of university governance and management, specifically autonomy \nand accountability, financing mechanisms, quality assurance and accreditation systems, and \nmanagement of research and development; and public\u2013private partnerships. Increased primary \nand  secondary  enrollment  is  increasing  demand  for  higher  education,  causing  a  severe \nimbalance between demand and supply. Data information systems in higher education lack \ninternal linkages, or linkages with private colleges. They lack coordination, integration, and \naccess to an MOE central management information system. \n \n                                                 \n1  Ogawa, Keiichi. 2008.

Education Sector Development Framework). Vientiane: MOE. \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \n5.  At present only the National University of Laos (NUOL) has a council and a council \npresident. CU and Souphanovoung University (SU) do not currently have formal governance \narrangements in place to allow them to effectively manage the universities. At present, strategic \nplanning for higher education in the Lao PDR remains largely undeveloped. MOE provides \noverall direction for higher education, as outlined in the legislation. This includes appointments, \napprovals and recommendations, institutional plans, and curriculum-related matters. This high \nlevel of control limits the degree to which institutions are able to position themselves for future \nstrategic development. The underfunding of the university system as a whole, and the year-on-\nyear  financing  system  frustrates  medium-  to  long-term  planning.  A  priority  is  to  establish \ncouncils at CU and SU under the jurisdiction of their respective provincial education authorities. \nThis  should  be  regarded  as  an  essential  precondition  for  implementation  of  future  reform \nstrategies.  \n \n6.  The higher education sector does not currently have a standardized system in place for \nthe coordinated collection, dissemination, and utilization of up-to-date data and information to \nprovide support for higher education administration and management. The higher education \nsubsector also lacks linkages with private colleges. The lack of such a mechanism adversely \naffects administrative efficiency and management effectiveness. In addition to the lack of a \nfunctioning education management information system, no centralized or standardized student \ndatabase is maintained to monitor the progress of individual students in the system. Centralized \ntimetabling systems are not used so that teaching spaces are not used efficiently. The current \npractice  is  that  classrooms  are  \u201cowned\u201d  by  particular  faculties.  Operating  efficiency  of  the \nDepartment  of  Higher  Education  and  higher  education  institution  (HEI)  management  and \nadministrative  system  is  in  critical  of  improvement  by  strengthening  MOE\u2019s  education \nmanagement information system. \n \n7.  Relevance, Attractiveness, and Competitiveness. Assessment and analysis of the \nrelevance of higher education system output shows that significant imbalances exist between \nthe demand for and supply of university graduates. There is a shortage of professional and \ntechnical personnel such as administrators, accountants, lawyers, and engineers in both public \nand private sectors. Most HEIs cannot meet the needs of the labor market at present and little \ninformation  is  currently  available  on  the  employment  designations  of  university  graduates. \nPreliminary rapid labor market surveys, carried out in association with the Strengthening Higher \nEducation Project (the Project) project preparatory technical assistance are the first steps in the \nprocess of mapping the destinations of graduates against labor market needs. Further tracer \nstudies  will  be  launched  to  collect  benchmark  information  on  gradates  and  monitor  their \nperformance in the labor market. Initial results indicate a recent change in student demand at \nNUOL to law and tourism, which represents a trend away from the previous preference for \neconomics,  business  management,  and  information  technology.  In  the  commercial  sector, \ncustomer service, hotel and guesthouse operations, foreign languages, tourism operations, and \ncomputer technology are key labor market needs identified by the project preparatory technical \nassistance rapid labor market survey. These are the same fields of study now being offered by \npublic and private tertiary institutions. The key problem seems to be that the private sector and \nthe pool of tertiary school graduates are very young. Most enterprises are less than 6 years old, \n20% are less than 1 year old.2 One result of this new employer\u2013new employee profile is a \nshortfall in supervisors with capacity for developing new staff. This contributes to the frustration \nreported by employers that college graduates lack the right skills and the frustration by students \nthat they don\u2019t get to practice what they were taught. The number of public university graduates \n                                                 \n2  National Statistics Center. 2007. Report of Economic Census 2006. Volume 1. Vientiane. \n ", "Appendix 2  33 \ntripled between 2000 and 2006. The bulk of college graduates are still in their transition period \nwhere they are in their first job or jobs and developing their understanding of the workplace and \nwork  skills,  a  difficulty  compounded  by  the  out-of-date  material  and  inexperience  of  their \ninstructors. The apparent market failure may simply be an inefficient job placement system \ncompounded by the employer's desire for experienced staff against the graduate's need for a \nfirst job.  \n \n8.  Past  international  partnerships  are  assessed  as  being  largely  symbolic  rather  than \npractical, with none of the partnerships adequately resourced The NUOL strategic plan includes \nthe intention to promote mutual cooperation with international universities and organizations \nwith regard to academic exchange, faculty exchange, joint research and publication, and other \nissues deemed appropriate within the cooperating institutions to foster capacity building and \nsustainability. However these endeavors have had a limited impact. The systematic building of \nsubstantial linkages with partner institutions, particularly those in neighboring countries, needs \nto be supported. \n \n9.  Very little academic research is currently carried out at universities. The most commonly \ncited reasons for low research output productivity are the large amount of time spent teaching \nby  most  academic  staff,  the  absence  of  appropriate  infrastructure  with  which  to  conduct \nresearch; and the absence of funding to support it. The provision of \u201cspecial courses\u201d held \nmostly in the evening also adversely affects research capacity. Since some staff are teaching up \nto 30 hours a week, little time is available to pursue research activities. Additionally, across all \ninstitutions, a shortage of all types of equipment reduces the ability of staff to conduct quality \nresearch. Funding for academic research is also scarce, as a direct result of the year-on-year \nfunding approach adopted for universities and the requirement for universities to generate their \nown recurrent funding. \n \n10.  Quality and Efficiency. The overall quality of public higher education is low due to the \npoor quality of secondary education, dilapidated facilities and equipment, and underqualified \nteaching staff. Few faculty members have postgraduate qualifications particularly at CU and SU, \nand  their  teaching  and  research  capacities  are  significantly  constrained  by  low  salaries, \nexcessive time spent teaching special courses, and lack of opportunity or funding for research. \nIn addition, uniform quality assurance and accreditation systems and measures have not yet \nbeen established. MOE\u2019s Quality  Assurance Center is currently responsible for developing \nquality assurance policies and procedures for all education areas including secondary, technical, \nand vocational education and training, and private higher education. However the center is quite \nnew and so far the policy development for higher education is not yet complete. As yet no \nnational framework is in place for qualifications and accrual of credit. No standardized system \nfor allocating credit points or centralized database to store such information is available. These \nconditions mean that study programs cannot easily be evaluated. Students are therefore not \nable to receive recognition of prior learning when transferring between faculties or institutions.  \n \n11.  Another significant constraint for higher education, particularly at CU and SU, is the low \nprofessional qualifications of academic staff. For the Lao PDR to reach its national goals for \nhither education, the qualifications, teaching skills, and research capabilities of existing staff \nmust be upgraded, and new staff recruited to respond to anticipated increases in student \nenrollment. While NUOL has a reasonably well-qualified teaching staff. few faculty members at \nCU and SU have postgraduate qualifications. The new universities are staffed by new graduates \nwhose research and teaching capacity are greatly constrained.  \n \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \n12.  As of 2009, NUOL listed a total of 1,520 faculty and 350 administrative staff: 258 faculty \nmembers are listed as studying internationally and 932 as actively teaching.3 Of the total faculty, \n55 have doctoral degrees, 436 have master\u2019s degrees, 774 have bachelor degrees, and 92 \nhave  diplomas.  The  figures  show  that  491  faculty  have  postgraduate  qualifications\u2014\napproximately  32%  of  the  academic  staff.  NUOL  has  articulated  a  target  of  10%  doctoral \ndegrees,  60%  master\u2019s  degrees,  and  30%  bachelor  degrees  by  2015.  This  presents  a \nsignificant increase in the number of faculty with master\u2019s and doctoral qualifications. The \nsituation  at  CU  and  SU  is  more  critical.  Of  221  academic  staff  at  CU,  \n4 have doctoral qualifications and 31 master\u2019s. At SU, of 192 academic staff, 2 have doctoral \nqualifications and 21 master\u2019s. Both CU and SU are aiming for a similar mix of qualifications \n(10:60:30) as indicated by NUOL. Current training programs for upgrading faculty qualifications \nwill not be able to provide the number of staff needed to meet these qualification targets. \nAchieving  international  standards  for  teaching  and  course  delivery  requires  a  serious  and \nsustained professional development program. At present no uniform system is available to \nassess professional performance of academic staff. \n \n13.  The low salaries for academic staff must also be regarded as a significant constraint \naffecting higher education, with the result that public universities have difficulty retaining skilled \nand experienced academic personnel, leaving the universities with an insufficient number of \nyoung,  underqualified,  and  relatively  inexperienced  staff.  Information  obtained  during  the \nsubsector analysis indicate that across the system, special course fees account for more than \n30% of university-earned income, and enrollment figures show that special course students \nconstitute around 30% of enrollment. Staff work on these courses in addition to their normal \nteaching duties, in some cases teaching up to a total of 30 hours per week or more. This has \nsignificant implications for the quality regular programs at the universities.  \n \n14.  The current status of campus library facilities varies considerably. At NUOL, the main \nlibrary  for  the  university  has  a  total  seating  capacity  of  approximately  310,  and  a  limited \ncollection  of  books.  While  internet  terminals  are  available  within  the  library,  less  than  \n10 terminals are available for almost 10,000 students. The broader information technology \ninfrastructure  on  campus  is  also  weak.  A  total  of  20  computer  labs  with  932  functioning \ncomputers are available on campus. Like classrooms, computer labs are strictly allocated by \nfaculty, making equal access and efficient utilization difficult. At SU, a large purpose-built library \nbuilding is largely unutilized. Only a few open access computer terminals are available in the \nlibrary building. CU currently has no viable library. The provision of an integrated ICT-based \nlearning, teaching, and professional development network, incorporating e-library facilities would \nprovide a cost-effective alternative to development of a traditional library.  \n \n15.  Access and Equity. Figures obtained during the subsector analysis indicate that total \nstudent  enrollment  at  the  three  public  universities  was  45,677  (NUOL  with  36,706,  \nCU with 4,755, and SU with 4,216). The University of Health Sciences has about 2,800 enrolled \nstudents.4 Currently about 5.3% of the tertiary education age cohort is enrolled at the three \npublic universities (NUOL, CU, and SU), the Ministry of Health-administered University of Health \nSciences, five teacher training colleges, and 86 private HEIs located in Vientiane and provincial \ncapital cities5 Capacity to meet the projected increase in the number of students is limited. In \n2007, only 24,754 students (about 57%) of the 43,653 upper secondary school graduates \n                                                 \n3  Data was obtained by the PPTA team during site visits to each of the three public HEIs. \n4  Information obtained from the University of Health Sciences, Vientiane, April 2009. \n5   Boupha, Phonephet. 2008.

This gap between enrollment demand and admission \ncapacity of public universities is expected to widen if current trends continue. To meet this \nunmet demand, many private colleges were established (mainly in business-related areas such \nas business administration, computer and information science, and English language) in recent \nyears.  \n \n16.  In addition to low enrollment, social and ethnic disparities in access still persist, resulting \nin low representation of women and ethnic groups. In 2008, female students represented 35.3% \nof student enrollment at NUOL, 36.6% at SU, and 49% at CU. At NUOL, ethnic quota students \ncomprised  approximately  35%  and  ethnic  female  quota  students  approximately  17%.  The \nassistance  provided  at  present  under  the  quota  system  consists  of  fees  being  met  and \naccommodation provided. Quota students are selected by provincial authorities on the basis of \ntheir results at the end of secondary school year and nominated to the Department of Higher \nEducation (DHE) for placement in the universities. They are largely drawn from rural areas and \ninclude ethnic groups. Scholarships are given to quota students to cover their fees. However \nmany of the quota students often come from schools that were below standard and may \nexperience  difficulties  because  they  may  be  underprepared  for  tertiary  study.  Their  living \nconditions in student dormitories are also extremely basic and not conducive to independent \nstudy. Quota students receive KN70,000 per month ($8.20), as a living allowance. This figure is \nvery low by any standard, and indicates the hardship many quota students face. Quota students \nare expected to return to their home provinces following graduation, and remain in government \nservice for 5 years. However this has not always been effective as students often prefer to \nremain in urban areas with greater employment opportunities. The quota system was intended \nto open access to higher education for disadvantaged students including ethnic origin students. \nSince no official enrollment data is available, anecdotal data is used to assess the effectiveness \nof the current support system for disadvantaged students. Many quota students selected for \nadmission are reported to fail to register for the commencement of their studies. This may be \ndue to delays in the publication of results of entrance tests, and the fact that students are \ndirected into courses of studies that may not have been their first choice. Under the Education \nSector Development Framework, student fees are set to rise substantially, but with an offset that \nseeks  to  guarantee  equity  of  access  to  worthy  but  financially  stressed  students.  These \nconditions indicate the need to more effectively target disadvantaged candidates, use more \nrigorous and effective selection procedures, provide a more substantial living allowance, cater \nmore directly for student study preferences, and support academically weak quota students with \ntailored preliminary skills upgrading programs.  \n \n17.  MOE plans to introduce a new education system by changing from 11 years school + 2 \nyears foundation + 3 years degree to 12 years school + 4 years degree from September 2011. \nHowever, the change has not been introduced in a coordinated way, with the result that the \ncurrent  undergraduate  intake  of  students  faces  different  conditions  from  one  institution  to \nanother. At NUOL, the School of Foundation Studies was abolished from the beginning of the \n2008/09 academic year, with the result that individual faculties are now running their own basic \nfoundation programs. At CU and SU, the change is expected to be in place from September \n2009. This change is expected to have a significant impact on quota students, many of whom \nwill  not  be  able  to  cope  with  the  academic  rigors  of  tertiary  studies  without  undergoing \nappropriate bridging training. Faculty-based foundation training will be variable in quality and \ndifficult to regulate or to assess outcomes. \n \n18.  terms of infrastructure, facilities, classroom space, and equipment, all public institutions \nsurveyed report that they are currently operating at full capacity. This means that they would be \nunable to meet the stated targets of increasing enrollment without  substantially increasing \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \navailable physical infrastructure at all university campuses. Existing capacity can however be \nincreased by more efficient use of teaching spaces.  \n \n19.  The quality of infrastructure, facilities, and equipment varies considerably across the \nthree universities. While NUOL is relatively well established, the newly opened CU and SU \nrequire very large investments in facilities (e.g., teaching rooms, equipment, and research and \nteaching laboratories). Equipment and teaching support infrastructure at NUOL needs to be \nregularly maintained and upgraded to keep pace with technological developments and cater for \nfuture expansion of student enrollment.  \n \n20.  An overwhelming need for additional infrastructure exists at CU. A primary focus of ADB \ngrant assistance to higher education will be to carry out substantial civil works, as a precursor to \nall other development activities, at the CU campus. A development strategy for civil works, \nfacilities, and equipment at CU, within specified scoping and budgetary parameters, is therefore \npresented as a key output for ADB grant assistance. \n \n21.  Finance. The universities construct their budgets by identifying the estimated student \nload in all categories, and forward an estimation of their income. On this basis, the Government \ndetermines its allocations to the universities. In government accounting data for education \nsector funding, \u201cprivate funding\u201d refers to funds received from development agencies. The data \nindicates that such funding has outpaced government funding by a factor of 3\u20134 to 1 for several \nyears. Determining the exact proportion of government direct funding relative to development \nfunding is difficult. However, development funding clearly comprises a significant contribution. \nThe importance of this nongovernment funding is shown in Education Sector Development \nFramework projections. Of all education subsectors, higher education alone is scheduled to \nreceive less government direct funding by 2015. Conversely, by that date, private funding is set \nto constitute 80% of financial inflow. However  the proportion contributed via student fees is not \nclear. \n \n22.  The private higher education system represents a large component of tertiary education. \nPrivate higher education has the potential to contribute significantly to the financing of higher \neducation. However MOE must closely monitor the operation of private HEIs to ensure they \nmeet minimum quality standards. A standardized quality regulatory framework used to monitor \noperation and performance in public universities should also be applied to private HEIs. DHE \nneeds to be empowered to accredit new private HEIs provided they meet the specified minimum \nstandards. DHE also needs to carry out regular audits of private HEIs to ensure that they \ncomply with the standards framework criteria.

The Strengthening Higher Education Project (the Project) will provide a program of \ninternational and in-country master\u2019s and doctoral degree programs for academic staff, and for \nsenior management personnel from the Ministry of Education (MOE) and universities. A priority \nfor the Project is to address the issue of low professional qualifications of academic staff at the \ncountry\u2019s  universities,  particularly  at  Champasak  University  (CU)  and  Souphanouvong \nUniversity (SU). Upgrading of qualifications, teaching skills, and research capabilities of existing \nstaff is urgently needed, and additional new staff recruited to respond to anticipated increases in \nstudent enrollment. At present, the new universities (CU and SU) are staffed by mainly new \ngraduates with limited opportunities to upgrade their qualifications or carry out research. \n \n2.  In 2009, of the total 1,265 graduate academic and administrative staff at the National \nUniversity of Laos (NUOL), 55 had doctoral education (4%), 436 had master\u2019s degrees (34%), \nand 774 had bachelor degrees (62%). The universities have articulated a target qualification \nratio of 10%:60%:30% by 2015. The current mix at CU is 2:16:82; at SU, it is 1:12:77. The \nProject provides a significant scholarship program to redress this staffing qualification shortfall.  \n \nA.  Program Description \n \n3.  International and Domestic Degree Programs. The Project will provide the opportunity \nfor 147 staff and faculty members to undertake study for higher degree qualifications in the Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and abroad. This includes 40 master\u2019s degrees mostly \nin neighbouring countries (approximately 20 for CU, 13 for SU, 7 for NUOL); and 20 doctoral \nprograms in neighboring and developed countries (10 for CU, 7 for SU, 3 for NUOL). In addition, \nthe Project will fund 7 postgraduate degrees (4 master\u2019s degrees and 3 doctoral degrees) for \nthe  staff  of  the  Department  of  Higher  Education  (DHE)  of  MOE,  and  80  public  university \nacademic staff to study at the master\u2019s level at NUOL in Vientiane. The bulk of the degree \ntraining will be undertaken over years 2\u20134 of the Project, phased carefully to minimize the \nimpact of the removal of key staff from faculties that are already understaffed. This time frame \nwill  allow  the  Project  to  ensure  that  recipients  of  scholarships  return  to  their  respective \nworkplaces, and that returnees subsequently make full use of skills acquired from their training.  \n \n4.  International Matching Scholarship Grants. A new scheme of matching scholarship \ngrants  (50:50  matching  between  the  Project  and  partner  foreign  universities  that  provide \nscholarships to the Lao PDR) will be implemented on a pilot basis. Of the 60 master\u2019s and \ndoctoral scholarships specified, up to 40 are expected to be funded through the matching grant \nscheme, with a view to providing study in postgraduate degree programs in developed countries \nsuch as Australia, Japan, United Kingdom, or United States. This is expected to significantly \nextend the number of scholarships that might be offered by the Project. The Project will cover \nthe tuition fess and international travel costs, while partner foreign universities in developed \ncountries  will  cover  the  living  costs  and  other  expenses  that  would  be  higher  than  in \nneighbouring countries.  \n \nB.  Scholarship Selection Criteria (Indicative) \n \n5.  Selection will initially be prioritized to address current critical shortfalls in staffing within \nparticular faculties or disciplines. Selection will take account of priority needs determined by \ninitial labor market needs analyses. The selection package for the first scholarship cohort will be \nproduced and implemented by the third quarter of year 1. The same process will be repeated for \nthe two successive cohorts in years 2 and 3. \n ", "50  Appendix 8 \n6.  The  professional  development  unit  (PDU)  to  be  located  at  NUOL  will  develop  a \ntransparent and merit-based selection process in coordination with outreach PDUs at CU and \nSU and DHE project implementation unit. The selection process will be managed by the central \nPDU under the guidance of specialist advisors. The MOE project coordination unit will approve \nthe final selection of each cohort.  \n \n7.  The following two sets of indicative selection criteria will be used to select suitable \ncandidates for degree scholarships: (i) general eligibility criteria, and (ii) other eligibility criteria. \nThe general eligibility criteria include:  \n \n(i)  be a citizen and resident of the Lao PDR and not have a permanent residence in \nany other country; \n(ii)  at the time of application, be not more than 45 years of age; \n(iii)  have worked for a minimum of 2 years in relevant employment in MOE or a \nhigher education institution;  \n(iv)  be supported by supervisors, and have signed a written agreement for continuing \nrelevant employment for a minimum of 2 years after graduation; \n(v)  provide evidence that new personal research skills in the discipline selected \ncould contribute to enhancing their university\u2019s teaching and research programs; \n(vi)  demonstrate that the training is consistent with the development priorities of the \nLao PDR; and  \n(vii)  for international programs, have met, or be able to meet before commencement \nof the course, the academic entry requirements and English language proficiency \nset by the university for the study program for which enrollment is sought. \n \n8.  Other  eligibility  criteria  will  be  established  to  ensure  that  the  scholarship  program \nassistance supports the access and equity targets specified in project design. These include the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  A  target  of  at  least  50%  is  specified  for  female  candidates  selected  for \nscholarship awards.  \n(ii)  A target of 20% is set for candidates selected from target ethnic groups or the six \npoorest provinces identified via recognized poverty indicators.  \n \nC.   Evaluation and Sustainability  \n \n9.  The anticipated impact of the scholarship program will be measured in terms of the \nextent to which graduate alumni return to their respective workplaces. The Project will execute \nagreements with all candidates receiving scholarships or grants for undertaking foreign degrees \nand local master\u2019s degrees to ensure scholarship recipients continue working with the same \nministry or higher education institution for at least 5 years after completing a foreign degree \nprogram and 2 years after completing local master\u2019s degrees. To assess the efficacy of the staff \nand faculty development programs, participant feedback methodologies including postactivity \nassessment  will  determine  the  extent  their  newly  acquired  skills  will  be  utilized  in  their \nrespective workplaces.  \n ", "    Appendix 9  51 \nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS \n \nA.    Economic Analysis \n \n1.  By improving access to and, particularly, the quality and relevance of higher education, \nthe Project will have important economic benefits for individuals and the overall economy. \nParticularly  in  economies  characterized  by  rapid  growth  and  transformation,  completion  of \nhigher education is associated with higher individual wages as well as enhanced capacity to \nrespond  to  new  economic  opportunities  in  emerging  modern  sectors.  Limited  data  and  a \ndiversity of types, delivery modes, and quality of postsecondary education in the Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) make obtaining precise, unbiased estimates of the returns to \nhigher education difficult. However, existing evidence suggests that with the country\u2019s rapid \ngrowth and economic transformation, demand for human capital has outstripped the supply of \ntertiary education graduates, resulting in a growing wage premium for graduates from higher \nversus secondary education. Investments in expanding the enrollment capacity at Champasak \nUniversity will increase the number of higher education graduates flowing into the labor market \nannually, while the impact of improved quality and relevance of education will enhance labor \nmarket returns to graduates of all three universities.  \n \n2.  The Project will yield significant macro benefits. Currently, an inadequate supply of \nhighly  educated  young  adults  poses  a  major  constraint  to  the  country\u2019s  economic  vitality, \ncompetitiveness,  ability  to  attract  foreign  direct  investment,  and  ability  to  advance  in \ntechnological areas into higher value-added sectors. The potential benefits for economic and \nbroader national development are clearly reflected in the high degree of priority the Government \nascribes to expanding and improving higher education. In addition to enhancing the efficiency of \nstate funding for education and supporting increased education access, relevance, and quality \nin the public university system, the Project will strengthen the regulatory environment and \nquality assurance in the private higher education subsector, magnifying its short and longer-\nterm economic impacts. \n \n3.  The Project's approach also appears strongly justified on cost, sustainability, and equity \ngrounds,  when  compared  with  other  options  for  expanding  higher  education  access.  A  first \nalternative might be to send more students to universities in neighboring countries. However, \naside from issues such as language of instruction and curricular alignment, the costs of tuition, \ntravel, accommodation, and other living expenses for study abroad greatly exceed those for in-\ncountry study, and are generally rising at a rapid rate in nearby countries. Under various cost-\nsharing schemes, this would pose a heavy and rising burden on both the Lao government and \nindividuals. Relying on study abroad rather than developing the domestic higher education system \nwould  also  raise  other  serious  issues,  including  inequity  (as  poorer  students  with  weaker \nacademic backgrounds would be excluded), relevance of learning to Lao labor markets, and \npotential for increased movement of educated labor out of the Lao PDR. It would also undercut \nthe development of national human resources in the country and the domestic higher education \nsystem's contributions to local economic development. A second potential alternative would be to \nrely principally on domestic private sector higher education provision, with the state providing \nvouchers or other subsidies. However, while charges across private higher education institution \n(HEI) programs vary considerably, they generally exceed the estimated total per-student costs of \neducation in public universities, and this cost disparity is likely to grow over time. In addition to \ncost and equity concerns, in the present context, education quality is problematic in many of the \ngrowing array of HEIs. Given this, the Project's approach to supporting expanded, higher-quality \npublic higher education while strengthening the policy and regulatory framework for both public \nand private HEIs (including quality auditing and alignment of curricula) appears strongly justified.  \n ", "52  Appendix 9 \nB.  Labor Market Assessment \n \n4.  The labor market is in a dynamic but nascent state. Only 7% of all workers are employed \nby the Government and private sector. The rest are own account and unpaid family workers: \nfarmers and their wives1 and small family businesses. The private sector is characterized by \nentrepreneurship rather than expertise, such as the contractor turned hotelier. Young people \nentering higher education choose a field of study in their second year with little understanding of \nfuture prospects. At graduation, they find jobs by word of mouth. Few new graduates are \nunemployed, less than 3%, as they cannot afford to be idle. As a result, they face a long \ntransition period, referred to as \"not finding a job in their field of study,\" where they try out \ndifferent types of employment, often at low wages, while gaining experience and work skills \nbefore  settling  into  longer-term  employment.  The  transition  period  is  exacerbated  by  (i) \nemployer's  lack  of  sector  experience  and,  thus,  ability  to  provide  on-the-job  training;  (ii) \ninefficient job placement system; and (iii) the quality of their education.  \n \n5.  The pool of university graduates is young. From 2000 to 2006, the number of graduates \nproduced by the public system increased from 2,200 per year to 6,000. The bulk of college \ngraduates are still in their transition period where they are in their first job or first jobs, and are \ndeveloping their understanding of the workplace and work skills. This is made more difficult by \nout-of-date material and inexperience of their instructors. Labor force participation by male and \nfemale  university  graduates2 is  high  relative  to  secondary  school  and  elementary  school \ngraduates: 86% of university graduates are in the labor force compared with 48% for upper \nsecondary, 58% for lower secondary, and 60% for elementary school. Unemployment is low \nacross all levels of education. Although investment into university education is more costly than \nlower education, it does yields more workers per 100 graduates.  \n \n6.  The  Government\u2019s  first  economic  census  in  2006  enumerated  127,000  enterprises \nemploying  345,000  workers,  almost  equally  divided  between  men  and  women.  The  survey \nexcludes enterprises in villages without roads and mobile operations such as fruit vendors. The \ncensus shows the private sector to be young: 20% of all enterprises were established less than 1 \nyear and 60% for less than 5 years; only 2.4% had more than 10 employees. One result of this \nyoung employer\u2013young employee profile is a shortfall in supervisors with capacity for developing \nnew staff. This contributes to the frustration reported by employers that college graduates lack the \nright skills and the frustration by students that they don\u2019t get to practice what they were taught.  \n \n7.  Another  costly  and  potentially  socially  disruptive  result  is  the  importation  of  skilled \nworkers such as accountants, engineers, and supervisors. The 2006 economic census shows \nthat  4%  of  private  sector  employees  are  foreign.  Most  are  in  wholesale  or  retail  trade, \nconstruction, and manufacturing. The tourism sector is small but with high growth potential. \nThere, foreign staff are found even below the supervisor level, at the front office checking in \nguests, providing information about places of interest in the area, and night auditing or compiling \nfinancial reports on daily activities for management. \n \n8.  Project initiatives will reduce the duration of the transition period and need for foreign \nstaff through an improved and more relevant curriculum, increased ties and communication \nbetween employers and lecturers ensuring enhancing curriculum content, earlier and more \nfrequent student exposure to the workplace, and student placement support. \n                                                 \n1  Of those surveyed, 42% are own account workers (68% male and 32% female) and 45% unpaid family workers \n(29% male and 71% female). In household enterprises the husband is identified as the own account worker while \nthe wife is identified as the own account worker. \n2  Results from the Population and Housing Census 2005 and the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2008. \n ", "    Appendix 9  53 \nC.   Financial Sustainability Analysis \n \n9.  The financial sustainability analysis determines the fiscal impact of the Project on the \nGovernment\u2019s projected budget during the 6 years planned for project implementation. The \nanalysis assesses the affordability and, therefore, sustainability of the Project vis-\u00e0-vis the \ngovernment budget. The Government\u2019s share in the Project is estimated at $2.0 million over 6 \nyears  (according  to  the  Country  Operation  Business  Plan,  2009\u20132011);  this  includes \nincremental recurrent cost due to the Project, and taxes and duties. Two scenarios are used to \nanalyze  affordability:  (i)  a  high  case  scenario  where  the  Government  education  budget  is \nprojected for 2010\u20132015 based on trends of actual 2002\u20132008 budgets, and (ii) a low case \nscenario where the education budget remains the same from 2010 to 2015.  \n \n10.  The  annual  share  of  the  Government  in  the  project  cost,  together  with  estimated \ncommitments in the ongoing ADB-funded Basic Education Sector Development Program, were \ncompared with the annual education budget for 2010 to 2015 under both scenarios. For the high \ncase scenario, the Government\u2019s annual commitment as a percentage of the education budget \nranges from 0.05% to 0.67%, with an average of 0.32% over the 6-year life of the Project (Table \nA9.1).

In  both  scenarios,  the  Government\u2019s  annual  commitment  for  the  Project  and  Basic \nEducation Sector Development Program are deemed affordable. \n \n13.  The sustainability analysis also assesses the impact of reforms promoted by the Project \nfor cost recovery at the university level. In particular, it assesses the impact of two core reforms \non average cost-recovery per student. The first of these is the phased decrease in the share of \nquota students, who are provided living allowances while being exempt from tuition-related and \ndormitory  fees.  The  Project  targets  the  reduction  of  this  share  from  roughly  50%  of  total \nenrollment prior to the Project to 20% of students by project completion in 2015, with the latter \nrestricted to those from the most disadvantaged families\u2014the result of more systematic and \naccurate targeting. The second and complementary core reform is the phased introduction of \ntuition  for  all  mainstream  courses  (but  exempting  the  poorest  students)  to  reach  a  level \nequivalent to average fees formerly charged for special courses, thereby unifying all course \nofferings under a singular system. Growing demand for fee-based special courses at public \nuniversities and the rapid growth of an array of generally more costly private higher education \nprograms demonstrate willingness-to-pay, thus indicating that such cost-recovery is viable.  \n \n14.  For  a  range  of  indicative  parameters,  enhanced  cost-recovery  and  more  targeted \nprovision  of  quota  subsidies  are  projected  to  result  in  substantial  cost  recovery  even  in \nscenarios that include a 50% increase in the living allowances provided to the poorest 20% of \nstudents remaining on quota. While gaps in available data prevent precise estimation, the \nreforms phased-in by project completion are projected to more than double cost-recovery per \nstudent in 2015 onward, compared with the no-reform scenario. This implies a substantial \ndecrease in the Government's budget burden, while freed-up resources could be redeployed to \nfund operation and maintenance, and investments to enhance education quality. At the same \ntime, by rationalizing the allocation of education resources across mainstream and currently \nseparate  special  courses,  the  reforms  would  contribute  to  increased  system  efficacy  and \nefficiency, while improving equity. Finally, in addition to ensuring the sustainability of project \ninterventions,  the  reforms  will  help  ensure  that  the  expansion  of  higher  education  can  be \nachieved without drawing state resources from lower tiers of education, thereby supporting \nsustainable and equitable development of the education sector as a whole. \n ", "    Appendix 10  55 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry and Project Title: Lao People's Democratic Republic: Strengthening Higher Education Project \n \nSoutheast Asia Department/ \nLending/Financing Modality:  Grant  Department/Division: \nSocial Sectors Division \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe comprehensive National Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (NGPRS) is built on the concept of growth with equity. It notes \nthat increasing the number of tertiary school graduates is needed to improve economic rates of return on human capital \ninvestment, and that professionals and intellectuals are required to harness modern science and technology for development \nneeds. Improving tertiary education supports delivery of quality social services while reducing dependence on cheap labor to \nattract foreign domestic investment. The NGPRS targets a 6% increase in the number of tertiary school graduates between 2005 \nand  2020.  The  Education  Sector  Development  Framework  2009\u20132015  is  an  explicitly  pro-poor  framework  addressing \ninclusiveness and equity in education for poor and ethnic minority pupils from preschool through nonformal and tertiary \neducation. Thus investments in tertiary education are planned in the context of the overall system. The midterm review of the \n2009 country partnership strategy recognizes the need to include tertiary, and technical and vocational education and training \n(TVET) development as part of the comprehensive education sector development supported by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to increase the quality of human capital in the public and private sectors.a The Project is in line with the ADB Strategy \n2020, which notes that \"future competitiveness will be determined less by low wages for labor and more by the ability to produce \nand master technology and produce higher-value goods and services.\u201db The 2008 ADB study report, Education and Skills, \ndiscusses the role of higher education in national and regional development.c \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                 Targeting Classification: General Intervention (GI) \n \n1.    Key Issues  \nPoor quality human resources constrain the delivery of social services and the development of employment in small- and medium-\nsized enterprises. The shortage of tertiary school graduates and their relatively low quality contributes to a poverty trap where poorly \neducated college graduates return as teachers to teach poorly educated secondary school students, and where manufacturing and \nindustry are based on ample availability of cheap unskilled laborers who without technological skills are unable to advance to \nhigher value-added sectors. The current incidence of poverty is 28%,d down from 33% in 2003\u2014a major achievement for the \ncountry. Further inroads in poverty reduction will require development of processing industries, and creation of higher productivity \nand better paid jobs. The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is surrounded by countries with highly skilled labor. More \ninvestment is needed at all levels of education to enable the country to move ahead rather than fall further behind. \n \nEquity is a major issue. Enrolment in tertiary education has been primarily male, from specific ethnic groups, and from better-off \nhouseholds. To promote national unity and women's equality the Government provides a 50% quota or scholarships emphasizing \nadmission of women and ethnic minorities. The quota system has suffered from low transparency and the perception that students \nfrom better-off households were the primary beneficiaries. Due to funding constraints, the scholarship and living allowance provided \nis insufficient to cover actual costs, therefore students from poor households often are unable to afford to continue their education \ndespite the scholarship. The result is that opportunities for the advancement of ethnic minorities and women are missed. \n \nThe Project is designed to strengthen the higher education system as a whole. As Souphanovoung University in Luang Prabang and \nthe National University of Laos (NUOL) in Vientiane have already received substantial external assistance to increase their physical \ncapacity, only the unserved Champasak University (CU), serving the five southern provinces, is scheduled for investment in increase \nphysical capacity. Investments in other capacity building activities including staff and faculty development programs, and textbook \nand material development are allocated across the national university system.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe social analysis indicates huge demand for post senior secondary education driven by increased participation rates in lower \neducation, decreasing poverty, and the importance students and their families place on tertiary education. While enrollment \ncapacity of public universities has more than tripled since 2000, the private sector has responded to fill the gaps. The increase in \ncapacity has not been matched by the increased quality required to obtain the true value of the finances and effort expended. As \na result, a public sector intervention is needed to improve the quality of the public system and to provide guidance and leadership \nfor the private sector. The private sector is unlikely to invest in accreditation and creation of standards since these are public \ngoods whose benefit they cannot capture. Therefore the public sector\u2019s role is to intervene. \n \n ", "56   Appendix 10 \n \nAccess is a major concern. Tertiary education is largely for male, although the gap is closing. Students from rural areas, \nespecially areas where ethnic groups are concentrated have difficulty competing because of the relatively poor quality of basic \nand secondary education in these areas. Providing remedial actions such as scholarships and living allowances, ensuring \nadequate dormitory facilities for women, and providing academic support to students from underrepresented areas are important. \n \nThe investment in CU is needed to equalize opportunities across the country, as the north and central regions are already \nserved. While students from the southern provinces can enroll in Souphanovong University or NUOL, the region misses the \ndevelopment impact of having an institution for higher education nearby. The university can and should play a role in supporting \ndevelopment of the business community. At present however few linkages exist in Champasak, Vientiane, or Luang Prabang. \nAnother project initiative is to create these linkages to increase the contribution of universities to regional growth and job creation. \n \nEmployers and students are disappointed with the current higher education system. Employers feel they are not getting the \ndesired expertise and graduates are not getting the good jobs they expected (Appendix 9). The issues involve the combination of \na new and inexperienced private sector, a pool of university graduates mainly comprising new labor market entrants, and a need \nto improve the curriculum content based on various factors including inputs from the private sector.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nDuring project preparation, the consultant and project team visited the three universities to meet with staff, propose project \nobjectives, and collect data and other information on higher education. The design was informed by a small-scale survey of students \non why they decided to enter university. Discussions were held with nonacademic stakeholder organizations such as the national \nand provincial chambers of commerce, Lao Women\u2019s Union, Lao Front for National Construction, and Poverty Reduction Fund staff.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n \n1.    Key Issues \nThe official policy of the Government of the Lao PDR is to promote national, district, and village gender equality. A key element of \nthis policy is to increase access for women and girls to education at all levels. In 2005, educational attainment of employed females \nin the labor force was 7.7% for technical and vocational qualification, college diploma, and university degree. Educational attainment \nwas comparatively higher for employed males: 8.6%, 2.2%, and 14.1% respectively. A gender imbalance exists in accessing primary \nand lower secondary education. Girls' enrollment in primary school lags that of boys\u2019 by approximately 14%, and in lower secondary \neducation by more than 12%. The net enrollment ratio for girls is also influenced by access in rural and urban areas: for primary \neducation it is estimated at 49% for girls in rural areas without road access (56% for boys), 72% in rural areas with road access (75% \nfor boys), and 91% in urban areas (88% for boys). This leads to lower completion rates in primary education for girls (47%) \ncompared with boys (52%). These differentials continue for lower and upper secondary education. The low rate of female enrollment \nin lower secondary school leads to significantly lower female enrollment in teacher training colleges, and subsequently, low \nrepresentation in the field of teaching, particularly in lower and upper secondary schools.  \n \nThe same situation exists at universities. In terms of enrollment at CU, data shows that in 2008/09, of 4,750 total enrollment, \n1,918 students were female (40.3%) and 274 were from ethnic groups (37%). However when income data is factored into this \nequation, the female participation figure is considerable lower. Thus for the lowest income group, the data shows total enrollment of \n206, with 34 females (16.5%) and 41 ethnic origin students (20%). The data clearly show that the gender disparity for both samples \nis greater for students from ethnic rather than nonethnic groups. Poor students are severely underrepresented at CU. \n \n2.  Key Actions \n \nThe Project will address these issues through implementation of pro-female policies and strategic plans. These include effective \ntargeting of female quota students; maximizing female participation in workshops, scholarships, and other professional development \nactivities; ensuring gender sensitivity in all curriculum materials; and providing accommodation and facilities at CU catering \nspecifically to the needs of female students. A gender and ethnic groups action plan was prepared; its implementation will be \nmonitored by quarterly progress reports and semiannual, midterm, and project completion review missions.  \n \n  Gender and ethnic group action plan         Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 10  57 \nIII.

The  Strengthening  Higher  Education  Project  (the  Project)  incorporates  actions  to \naddress key development issues affecting higher education. These include achieving equity, \nreducing gender and sociocultural disparities, overcoming barriers and obstacles for women and \nethnic groups, and ensuring equal access to high-quality and relevant higher education training. \nThe gender and ethnic groups action plan (GEGAP) is based on a gender analysis; an analysis \nof relevant ethnic group composition in the south of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR); a survey of female participation at Champasak University (CU), including student ethnic \nand student enrollment and graduation data; and gender composition of administrative and \nacademic  staff  at  CU.  It  builds  upon  ongoing  initiatives  carried  out  in  previous  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)-supported  projects,  following  the  basic  principles  of  prioritizing \nresource allocation to geographically targeted remote ethnic group areas, especially where \ngender disparities tend to be larger; promoting participation of ethnic groups and females in \nproject activities; promoting gender- and ethnic-sensitive curriculum, materials, and policy and \nstrategy development; and strengthening capacity of CU to address ethnic and gender concerns \nand equality in provision of higher education. The GEGAP follows regulations of the Lao PDR, \nand  ADB\u2019s Policy  on Gender  and  Development  (2003) and  Policy on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(1998). \n \n2.  Overview of Gender and Ethnic Groups. Key gender issues for the Project include  \n(i) an imbalance in educational attainment at upper secondary and tertiary, where fewer girls \nthan  boys  are  enrolled;  and  (ii)  an  imbalance  in  tertiary  teaching  staff  as  male  teachers \nsignificantly outnumber female teachers. The region surrounding CU contains a diverse range of \nethnic groups particularly in the upland regions more distant from Pakse. Sekong\u2019s population is \nmade up of more than 90% non-Lao ethnic groups. For the southern region, the predominant \nnon-Lao ethnic groups belong to the Austro-Asiatic linguistic groups, formerly classified as \u201cLao \nTeung\u201d\u2019 (Table A11.1).  \n \nTable A11.1: Percentage of Ethnic Groups by Province in Champasak University \nCatchment Area  \n \nProvince  Tai- Kadai (Lao)  Austroasiatic  Hmong-Yao  Sino-Tibetan  Others \nChampasak  86.1  12.4  0  0  1.5 \nSaravane  61.7  37.8  0  0  0.5 \nSekong  8.9  90.8  0  0  0.3 \nSavannakhet  76.4  22.6  0  0  1.0 \nAttapeu  37.2  62.3  0  0  0.5 \nSources: National Statistic Center Population Census 1995, and Lao Front for National Construction, Department of \nEthnic Affairs, 1999. \n \n 3.

Poverty and Educational and Economic Opportunities. The national incidence of \npoverty based on the poverty line is estimated at 46%; about 53% in rural areas. Regionally, the \nincidence of poverty is 53% in the rural north, 47% in the center, and 66% in the south. Extreme \npoverty is especially prevalent in the south.1 The poverty gap index confirms the general trends \nin the head-count ratio and illustrates that the south is the poorest region, with greater poverty in \nthe  rural  areas.  Table  A11.4  shows  the  distribution  of  poverty  by  geographic  region, \ndisaggregated into urban and rural sectors. Further, poverty is highest in areas that also have a \nlarge proportion of people from small ethnic groups. The development of CU civil works and \ncampus facilities, combined with the targeting of ethnic, female, and poverty-affected students, \nshould have a significant impact on poverty reduction for the southern region of the Lao PDR.  \n \n6.  Legal Framework and Regulations. The Constitution of the Lao PDR, ratified in 1991, \nuses the term \u201ccitizens of all ethnicity\u201d throughout the document. It specifically recognizes the \nneed to incorporate the concerns of ethnic groups in developing policy in all sectors, and has \nreaffirmed its commitment to strengthen the rights of all ethnic groups in various congresses, \nconferences, decrees, and laws since the 1980s (Articles 8 and 22). Promoting gender equality \nis an important national goal as reflected in the National Strategy for the Development of \nWomen (1998\u20132005),the 1991 Constitution (articles 22 and 24), and a number of international \n \ncommitments. The National Commission for the Advancement of Women in Lao PDR was \nestablished in 1991 to help ensure women\u2019s equal access to basic services and productive \nresources  for  achieving  equity,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness  of  policies  and  projects.  The \ncommission develops the national strategy for the development of women and reports directly to \nthe Government. The Lao Women\u2019s Union helps implement the strategy.  \n \n7.  The  Government\u2019s  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy  (2004),  the \nGovernment\u2019s Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010), Education Strategic Vision \n2000\u20132020, Education Sector Development Plan (2006\u20132010), and National Plan of Action for \n                                                 \n1  Two poverty lines are defined: (i) the basic poverty line measures the household\u2019s ability to purchase a variety of \ngoods beyond food and dwelling needs; and (ii) the extreme poverty line measures the household\u2019s ability to \npurchase only the most absolute necessities: food, shelter, and clothing. \n ", "60   Appendix 11 \n \nEducation for All (EFA Plan) (2003\u20132015) provide guidelines for ensuring equity and gender \nequality including access to education and skills development, especially for ethnic girls in poor \nand disadvantaged areas. The EFA Plan and the Education Sector Development Plan both stress \ncritical targets regarding gender mainstreaming: (i) gender equality in education up to secondary \nschools, and (ii) curriculum and teacher training oriented to eliminating biases against girls.  \n \nTable A11.4: Incidence and Depth of Poverty, by Region and Sector, Lao PDR, 2002/03 \n \n  Poverty \n  Head-Count Ratioa  Poverty Gap Indexb \nRegion  Rural  Urban  Total  Rural  Urban  Total \nNorth  0.527  0.160 0.464 0.129 0.025  0.111\nCenter  0.469  0.257  0.404  0.118  0.060  0.100 \nSouth  0.662  0.288  0.598  0.224  0.017  0.188 \nAll  0.530  0.239  0.461  0.144  0.045  0.121 \n  Extreme Poverty \n  Head-Count Ratio Poverty Gap Index \n  Rural  Urban  Total  Rural  Urban  Total \nNorth  0.246  0.021  0.207  0.045  0.003  0.038 \nCenter  0.216  0.112  0.184  0.042  0.015  0.034 \nSouth  0.373  0.006  0.310  0.098  0.001  0.081 \nAll  0.260  0.076  0.216  0.055  0.010  0.044 \na  Head-count ratio shows the percentage of the population falling into the categories of poverty and extreme poverty. \nb  Poverty gap index measures the average transfer of resources that the poor need to escape poverty.

Implementation  Arrangements.  A  vice  minister,  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE),  and \ndirector general, Department of Higher Education, will oversee GEGAP implementation. The \nCenter for Integrated Education (formerly the Gender and Ethnic Groups Education Unit) has an \nimportant role in overseeing gender mainstreaming efforts in education. Representatives from \nthe Lao Women\u2019s Union and Lao Front for National Construction will facilitate participation by \ngirls, women, and ethnic groups in local project activities. International and national consulting \nservices  will  help  integrate  ethnic  and  gender  concerns  into  project  activities,  including  a \nnational gender and social development specialist for 6 person-months.
