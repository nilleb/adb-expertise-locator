A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is required to prepare all documents for \nthe sector project framework and core subprojects to be considered by ADB\u2019s Board. The PPTA is \nalso needed to support Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) in securing the liquefied natural gas (LNG) \nsupply  contract  which  is  critical  for  the  project  to  deliver  the  intended  energy  access  and \nsustainability benefits.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  A consulting firm will be employed to support PLN with the documentation of feasibility for \nthe  initial  subprojects.  This  consultancy  will  (i)  update  and  validate  relevant  studies,  conduct \nanalyses,  and  implement  necessary  surveys  as  required;  (ii)  review  demand  forecasts  and \npreliminary project designs, and undertake alternative scenario analysis for additional generation \ncapacity; (iii) conduct a rapid risk assessment and propose how to mitigate or manage the identified \nrisks; (iv) prepare all information and project documents required for the Board approval (technical \nfeasibility, economic and financial analysis) including framework documents for the sector project \nand those required under the Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) 2009; (v) enable PLN to draft the \nterms of reference (TOR) and bidding documents for turnkey or other contracts; and (vi) assess the \nfeasibility of supporting a large number of small subprojects (e.g. 5\u201320 MW) in combination with \nsupport for expanding and strengthening local distribution grids. The consultants will also organize \nworkshops and information dissemination sessions. In addition, individual expert consultants will be \nengaged to help PLN to finalize the overall concept for the LNG distribution network, support the \ntendering of LNG supply and distribution services, and look into how to ramp up the demand for LNG \nin order to reach critical mass and develop a LNG market in Eastern Indonesia. \n \n3.
