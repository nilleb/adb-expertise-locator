INTRODUCTION \n1.  Through its yearly evaluation programs, the Independent Evaluation Department (IED) of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provides  feedback  to  improve  the  development \neffectiveness of ADB assistance. IED's approved work program for 2011\u20132013 is based on \nADB's Strategy 2020,1 which made monitoring and reporting on effectiveness central to ADB \noperations, as well as on the operational priorities of the Asian Development Fund X.2 It features \n(i)  a  derived  program  aligned  with  country  operations  and  ADB's  strategic  and  thematic \npriorities, (ii) a real-time feedback and capacity development program, and (iii) a knowledge \nprogram. \n2.  This research and development technical assistance (TA)3 will continue support for the \nmulticountry and multisector evaluation activities of IED's ongoing derived country operations \nand knowledge programs with three types of evaluations: (i) five special evaluation studies \n(SESs) assessing (a) ADB\u2019s achievements in helping developing member countries (DMCs) \nattain  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  (b)  the  development  impacts  of  ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector operations, (c) the effectiveness of ADB\u2019s emergency assistance policy and \naction plan, (d) the design and implementation of ADB\u2019s microfinance development strategy \n(MDS),  and  (e)  ADB\u2019s  sector-wide  approach  (SWAp)  or  program-based  approach  in  the \neducation  sector;  (ii)  at  least  one  rigorous  impact  evaluation;  and  (iii)  country  assistance \nprogram evaluations (CAPEs) and associated sector assistance evaluations. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  A new results framework laid out under Strategy 2020 enables ADB to monitor and \nimprove its business performance. This TA will help IED provide evaluation feedback on ADB's \noperational effectiveness through SESs in five important areas. \n4.  Attaining Millennium Development Goals. The MDGs seek to end extreme poverty by \naddressing  its  manifestations\u2014low  income  and  hunger;  lack  of  access  to  education,  safe \ndrinking water, shelter, and a clean environment; gender exclusion; high maternal and child \nmortality rates; and the prevalence of communicable diseases. Under Strategy 2020, ADB aims \nto achieve its vision of an Asia and Pacific free of poverty by focusing on the MDGs and \nassesses its development effectiveness based on the region\u2019s progress toward these goals and \non other indicators (footnote 1). While Asia and the Pacific have made impressive strides toward \nthe MDGs for gender equity, disease control, and access to safe drinking water, performance on \nothers has been uneven across subregions and within countries.4 This is due to such factors as \npoor governance, regional inequalities, and the poverty trap that exists when nations are too \npoor to make the investments needed to reduce impoverishment.5 One of the five SESs under \nthis TA will assess ADB\u2019s performance in helping DMCs achieve the MDGs\u2014examining, for \nexample, how Strategy 2020 and country partnership strategies (CPSs) position ADB to help \npursue the goals both directly and indirectly. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

ADB\u2019s  private  sector \ndevelopment strategy approved in 2000 directed ADB to catalyze private sector projects that \ndeliver specific development impacts and demonstration effects in line with ADB\u2019s strategic \npriorities and country-specific operational strategies.6 Strategy 2020 supports an expansion of \nADB\u2019s work with the private sector to generate further economic growth in the region. ADB is to \nact as a catalyst for investments the private sector might not otherwise be willing to make, \nincluding  those  that  support  inclusive  growth  and  improve  the  environment.  Among  the \nquestions the SES will seek to answer are the following: Have ADB\u2019s private sector operations \n(PSOs) achieved their intended development outcomes and impacts? How can PSOs best \ncontribute to financial sector, private enterprise, and trade and infrastructure development, and \ncomplement public sector operations in these areas? How can ADB enhance the development \nimpacts of its PSOs in line with Strategy 2020? \n6.  Mainstreaming  disaster  risk  management  and  improving  disaster  response.  \nStrategy 2020 calls for mainstreaming disaster risk management and early to medium term \ndisaster  response  in  partnership  with  specialized  agencies.  ADB  provided  $11.6  billion  in \ndisaster and post-conflict assistance during 1987\u20132010 and needs to be ready to provide more \nin the future. This SES will be IED\u2019s first evaluation of the impact and effects of ADB\u2019s Disaster \nand Emergency Assistance (DEA) Policy7 and will address the following questions, among \nothers: Has disaster risk management been mainstreamed into the development process? Has \ncoordination with development partners improved? Has the value of community consultations, \nespecially in livelihood and community infrastructure projects, been enhanced? Aside from \nemergency assistance projects, what mechanisms have been incorporated into longer-term and \nmore  sustainable  disaster  risk-reduction  options?  Has  the  creation  of  specific  funds  for \nemergency assistance aligned ADB internationally with disaster risk reduction? Has progress \nbeen made on policies and instruments to augment immediate financial assistance during the \ndisaster relief period? \n7.  Developing sustainable microfinance systems. The MDS adopted in 2000 aimed to \ndevelop sustainable microfinance systems that would provide diverse, high-quality services.8 It \nfocused on (i) creating a policy environment conducive to microfinance, (ii) developing financial \ninfrastructure,  (iii)  building  viable  institutions,  (iv)  supporting  pro-poor  innovations,  and  (v) \nsupporting social intermediation. This SES will assess the design and implementation of the \nMDS to provide broad guidance for future ADB microfinance operations. The questions it will try \nto  answer  include  the  following:  In  what  ways  and  how  effectively  did  ADB  integrate \nmicrofinance into its operations in terms of the modalities used in different country contexts? \nHow did the MDS contribute to the development of microfinance in the region in terms of \ngovernment policy and regulatory environment, institutional capacity, microfinance activities, \nand  the  development  and  delivery  of  products  and  services?  To  what  extent  have  ADB \nmicrofinance projects achieved the intended outcomes and impacts of the MDS in outreach to \nthe poor and institutional sustainability? How has ADB coordinated with other agencies involved \nin  microfinance  and  monitored  the  progress  of  such  activities?  How  can  the  MDS  be \nstrengthened to enhance development effectiveness in line with Strategy 2020. \n8.  Implementing  a  sector-wide  approach  or  program-based  approach  in  the \neducation sector. Although the  SWAp or the program-based approach have been increasingly \nadopted to support reform and development in the education sector of DMCs, early results are \n                                                 \n6 The  private  sector  development  strategic  framework  was  revised  in  2006.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nmixed, with SWAps leading to  high transaction costs. Among other things, this SES will (i) \nexamine the SWAp process from the perspective of transaction costs incurred by DMCs and \ndevelopment partners like ADB, (ii) address conceptual and methodological issues in measuring \ntransaction  costs,  and  (iii)  draw  lessons  and  specific  implications  for  ADB  regarding  the \nconditions under which the SWAp process can be used successfully and how its transaction \ncosts can be reduced to increase the development effectiveness of ongoing and future ADB \nSWAp undertakings in education. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be the improvement of the development effectiveness of ADB \noperations, policies, strategies, and business processes, i.e., through lessons from evaluation \nfindings. Its expected outcome is an improvement in the formulation and implementation of ADB \npolicies, country and sector strategies, and public and private sector operations. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  An  evaluation  approach  paper  that  details  the  scope,  methodology,  resource \nrequirements, consultants\u2019 terms of reference, and dissemination plan will be prepared for each \nof the evaluation studies under this TA before evaluation work begins. \n11.  SES  on  Millennium  Development  Goals.  This  SES  will  assess  the  relevance, \neffectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of ADB\u2019s strategies and operations in helping its \nDMCs achieve the MDGs. The study will assess (i) the relevance of its corporate approaches to \nremoving impediments to reaching the MDGs; and (ii) the alignment of its partnership strategies \nat the country level with the DMCs own sector needs, priorities, and poverty alleviation policies. \nIt will seek to learn, for example, (i) how effective ADB has been in facilitating achievement of \nthe MDGs at country and regional levels; (ii) whether ADB has focused where the need is \ngreatest, and (iii) how efficient and cost effective ADB has been in selecting and implementing \nprojects and programs that are most appropriate for DMCs. The evaluation will also assess the \nsustainability of outputs and outcomes of ADB interventions and ADB\u2019s own performance. The \nSES will cover 2000\u20132010 and assess ADB activities through a select group of nine DMCs. The \nstudy will organize in-country consultation workshops with nongovernment organizations and \ngovernment offices to discuss and finalize the evaluation report. \n12.  SES on development impacts of private sector operations. The study of the impact \nof ADB\u2019s private sector operations will reflect IED evaluation guidelines that define development \nimpact  as  a  combination  of  (i)  project  contributions  to  private  sector  development,9  (ii) \ncontributions  to  economic  development,  (iii)  business  success,  and  (iv)  social  and \nenvironmental impacts. Most of these assessment areas correspond to the outcome or impact \nelements of ADB\u2019s design and monitoring framework. In addition to applying these criteria, the \nSES will assess to what extent any other envisaged development impacts have been achieved. \nThe SES will evaluate (i) ADB\u2019s strategic approach to ensuring development impact in PSOs, \nand (ii) the development outcomes and impacts at the project level for selected PSOs approved \nduring the 1996\u20132008 period (operations approved more recently likely to have few results to \nassess yet). The study will focus particularly on projects that sought to support financial sector \ndevelopment, including improving access to finance and making financial sector transactions \n                                                 \n9  This includes contributions to the development of sustainable and efficient financial institutions and markets, \nprivate ownership and entrepreneurship, competition and market efficiency, market expansion, the development of \nmarket frameworks, the mobilization of additional investment or financing, and the transfer and wider dissemination \nof new or improved industry or business skills, know-how, products, services, and standards. \n ", "4 \nmore efficient, as well as on ADB Private Sector Operations Department transactions primarily \naimed at the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.10 \n13.  SES on emergency assistance. The SES will evaluate the relevance, compliance, \neffectiveness, and impact of ADB\u2019s emergency assistance policy. It will build on previous IED \nand ADB studies. Among other things, the SES will (i) examine specific features of ADB\u2019s DEA \npolicy, including its intent, directives, pledges, commitments, and development approaches; (ii) \nassess the adequacy, coverage, and relevance of the DEA policy to ADB operations, taking into \naccount current and emerging regional and global issues on technical innovations and regional \ncooperation developments; (iii) assess whether the policy is comprehensive, consistent, and \nrobust enough from a technical perspective; (iv) examine the extent to which the policy has \nbeen considered in project design and implementation; (v) assess the effectiveness and impact \nof the policy by examining the performance of disaster and emergency assistance before and \nafter the 2008 policy approval, and by identifying trends that can be attributed to the policy; and \n(vi) identify lessons and issues to be considered in future ADB emergency assistance. \n14.  SES on microfinance development strategy. The SES will assess ADB microfinance \noperations since the MDS was adopted in 2000. It will include an in-depth review of projects on \nthe ground in eight DMCs\u2014three in Southeast Asia, two in South Asia, and one each in East \nAsia, in Central and West Asia, and in the Pacific. The SES will assess sector development and \nperformance through sample surveys of multilateral financial institutions and apex institutions to \ncollect  data  on  their  financial  and  operational  performance.  It  will  also  work  to  determine \nwhether  ADB  projects  are  reaching  their  intended  market  and  whether  households  have \npermanent access to a variety of services. A socioeconomic survey of microfinance clients will \nbe conducted for projects in selected countries. The combination of secondary, project, and \nsurvey data and the in-depth interviews will enable the evaluation team to assess the relevance, \nresponsiveness, and effectiveness of the MDS and draw out useful lessons for ADB\u2019s future \noperations. \n15.  SES on the sector-wide approach in education. This SES will apply a case study \nmethod in DMCs where ADB has been involved in the adoption of the SWAp in the education \nsector since the approach emerged in 1999. The DMCs will include, among others, Bangladesh \nand Nepal in South Asia and Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam \nin Southeast Asia. The SES will look at SWAps within a continuum rather than as a fixed \nsupport modality.11 It will (i) assess the application of SWAps in selected countries and identify \nfeatures that borrowers report streamlined support compared with alternatives and (ii) identify \nreadiness factors for SWAPs based on performance to date. The study will also evaluate the \neffects of transaction costs in the country cases and draw lessons on how and under what \nconditions unnecessary costs could be reduced over time. The study will also assess (i) offset \ntransaction costs associated with SWAp compared with transaction costs from more project-\noriented  approaches,  especially  from  a  DMC  perspective;  and  (ii)  the  time  dimensions  of \ntransaction costs which tend to be front-loaded. \n16.  Rigorous impact evaluations. The IED is committed under its approved 2011\u22122013 \nwork program to prepare at least one impact evaluation a year (footnote 2). Since 2007, these \nimpact evaluations have become more rigorous, although they remain dependent upon the \n                                                 \n10 The SES will focus on non-infrastructure projects because (i) a comparatively small number of infrastructure \nprojects approved since 1996 have had tangible development impacts to date, (ii) infrastructure transactions were \nreviewed in conjunction with the 2009 SES on ADB assistance for public\u2013private partnerships, and (iii) the Private \nSector Operations Department\u2019s energy sector operations are currently being refocused.  \n11 SWAps come in several forms, including the sector-wide working variety\u2014involving modest attempts to harmonize \ndonor  activities\u2014and  full-fledged  sector  budget  support  modalities,  including  joint  assistance  strategies  to \nrationalize TA support.  \n ", "5 \navailability of baseline data for project and nonproject areas. They are based on identification of \nvalid comparison groups (counterfactuals), large sample surveys, and application of appropriate \nquantitative analytical methods, supplemented by qualitative analysis. \n17.  Country, sector, and thematic evaluations. IED\u2019s derived country operations program \nwill include preparation of CAPEs or validations of CPS final reviews for select DMCs. Each \nCAPE  will  evaluate  ADB  support  to  the  country  and  cover  ADB  strategy,  policy  dialogue, \ncompleted and ongoing projects and technical assistance, and ADB performance. It will provide \nADB and the DMC with a basis for determining the future CPS. When appropriate, sector \nassistance program evaluations or rapid sector assessments will be undertaken to provide \ninputs during the preparation of each CAPE. Each sector assistance evaluation will evaluate \nADB  performance  within  a  given  sector  in  the  country,  focusing  again  on  strategy,  policy \ndialogue, ongoing and completed projects and technical assistance, and performance.  \n18.  Dissemination of knowledge publications. To make its evaluation products more \naccessible  and  influential,  IED  continues  to  disclose,  disseminate,  and  share  evaluation \nfeedback on performance and lessons learned. Using evaluation study results, it will prepare \nand  publish  syntheses,  briefs,  and  occasional  papers  tailored  to  enhance  readership  and \nprovide continuous feedback on ADB\u2019s operations, policies, and strategies.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1,300,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($700,000 from TASF\u2013IV, and $600,000 from \nTASF\u2013other sources). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. IED will implement the TA and supervise \nall planned studies. The studies will require the services of 23 international consultants for 34 \nperson-months and 49 national consultants for 62 person-months. The terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3. Detailed terms of reference for each study will be developed in the evaluation \napproach paper. ADB will engage consultants on an individual basis in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements \nunder the TA will be  made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA outputs will be disseminated in \naccordance  with  IED\u2019s  evaluation  policy,  particularly  with  regard  to  public  disclosure, \ndissemination, and learning lessons. The TA is scheduled to start 1 September 2011 and be \ncompleted  by  30  September  2013.  Implementation  arrangements  will  be  flexible  to \naccommodate any alterations in IED\u2019s work program or changes in response to priorities under \nStrategy 2020 and the Asian Development Fund X. ADB will obtain a no-objection from the \nDMC government prior to commencing any activity financed under this TA in the territory of the \nmember country concerned. \nIV.
