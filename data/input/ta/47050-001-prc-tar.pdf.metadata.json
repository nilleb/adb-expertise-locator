The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA) 1 for  Daguhe  Groundwater \nRehabilitation and Protection.2 In April 2013, an ADB mission visited the PRC and reached an \nunderstanding  with  the  government  on  the  TA\u2019s  rationale,  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost \nestimates, implementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The Qingdao municipal government requested support to prepare a comprehensive \nstrategic  planning  study  of  groundwater  resources  in  the  Daguhe  River  area.  Qingdao \nmunicipality depends heavily on Daguhe groundwater resources for its water supplies. These \nresources,  which  make  up  an  estimated  17%  of  Qingdao\u2019s  drinking  water  sources,  are \nthreatened by nitrate pollution from agricultural sources. The study will bring international good \npractices into the management and planning process for Daguhe groundwater uses, and it will \nbe of great significance for controlling nitrate pollution, restoring the ecological environment, \nprotecting groundwater resources, improving water supply capacity, and, ultimately, ensuring \nthe safety of drinking water for Qingdao municipality.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The  PRC  has  been  suffering  the  combined  effects  of  extensive  exploitation  and \nincreasing contamination of groundwater. Water scarcity has become a constraint on economic \ndevelopment and people\u2019s livelihoods in many areas. While detailed studies are few and data \nlimited, it is generally agreed that groundwater resources are under threat and have already \nbeen polluted in many areas. The PRC draws groundwater heavily. A large proportion of the \ngroundwater is used to irrigate the country\u2019s farmlands, and about 70% of its people in the \nnorthern regions are using groundwater for drinking. Rapid urban development and intensified \nagricultural activities have exacerbated pressure on groundwater resources.  \n \n4.  On 10 October 2011, the State Council approved the National Plan to Protect the Safety \nof  Groundwater  Resources  (2011\u20132020).  This  is  an  important  step  toward  tackling  water \nscarcity  in  the  PRC.  Along  with  overpumping  and  depletion  of  groundwater  resources, \ngroundwater contamination now poses a serious threat to people in the PRC. Overuse of \nfertilizers and large numbers of livestock in rural areas are key concerns. In many cases, nitrate \nand bacterial contamination exceed the natural absorption capacity and make groundwater \nunsuitable for direct human consumption. Studies conducted by Chinese research institutes \nindicate  that,  in  many  areas,  20%  to  50%  of  applied  nitrate  fertilizer  could  reach  the \ngroundwater table and slowly accumulate to unsafe levels. Rural runoff containing fertilizer or \npesticide  residues  has  long-term  impacts  on  groundwater  quality,  and  no  easy  technical \nsolutions are available to reduce such nonpoint pollution sources.  \n \n5.  Qingdao City in Shandong Province is among the cities in northern PRC with serious \nwater shortages. Rapid economic growth has significantly increased demand for water, which \nconstitutes a constraint upon its future development. The Daguhe River Basin, the largest in \nQingdao municipality with a catchment area of about 6,130 square kilometers (km2), is relatively \nsmall and surface water resources are insufficient and unreliable. The Daguhe groundwater \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in the 2013 nonlending pipeline in the country operations business plan for the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 July 2013. \n ", "2   \nresources constitute the largest and most reliable drinking water source in Qingdao City, playing \na critical role in ensuring the safety of potable water for the city. Located in the lower-middle \nreaches of the Daguhe basin, the Daguhe groundwater aquifer lies about 50 kilometers from the \nurban areas of Qingdao City and covers an area of approximately 420 km2. The city is also \ndeveloping\u2014at very high costs and energy consumption\u2014desalinization and large-scale water \ntransfers in an effort to ensure its supply.  \n \n6.  The sustainable development and utilization of Daguhe groundwater resources are of \ngreat concern to the municipal government. As a result of extensive agricultural activities in the \narea and the limited control measures in place, pollution of the Daguhe aquifer is increasing. \nNitrate pollution is the main concern, and the groundwater quality is deteriorating year by year. \nSignificant efforts have been made to conduct a series of small surveys and research on \nhydrogeology,  water  quality,  and  environment  capacity.  Through  these,  extensive  data  on \ngroundwater availability, quality, and environmental pollution sources have become available. \nThis information, however, has never been systematically assessed and reported.  \n \n7.  Responding to a number of serious groundwater pollution cases, including in Shandong \nProvince, various national experts have recommended that local governments formulate and \nenforce  strong  groundwater  pollution-prevention  and  protection  plans  backed  by  adequate \nfinancial resources, sufficient incentives not to pollute, and strong implementation of the existing \nregulations. The experts believe this is urgent, as potable water is scarce in the most populated \nareas and the PRC cannot afford the destruction of its groundwater resources.  \n \n8.  The TA supports ADB\u2019s strategic priorities in the country partnership strategy, 2011\u2013\n2015 for the PRC.3 It aims to promote environmental sustainability. It also supports the PRC\u2019s \nsustainable development agenda for a harmonious society, as outlined in the PRC\u2019s Twelfth \nFive-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. Conservation of water and natural resources will be supported \nthrough  assessing  and  planning  adequate  pollution  control  interventions  and  capacity \ndevelopment. The TA complements ongoing cooperation with the PRC on water resources \nmanagement  and  pollution  control,  including  the  preparations  of  a  proposed  Shandong \nGroundwater Allocation and Protection Project.  \n \n9.  The support is consistent with ADB's Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 to (i) increase \nwater  use  efficiencies  across  the  range  of  users;  (ii)  embed  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement,  including  improved  risk  management  to  mitigate  floods,  droughts,  and  other \nwater-related  disasters;  and  (iii)  expand  knowledge  and  capacity  development  that  uses \ntechnology and innovation more directly. The support will accelerate policy and institutional \nreforms\u2014by supporting enhancement of policy, legislation, and regulations; facilitating reform \nprocess; and strengthening institutional capacity and expanded knowledge base\u2014by promoting \nactivities that produce new and innovative approaches, strategies, and technologies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  impact  will  be  sustainable  utilization  and management  of  Daguhe groundwater \nresources. The outcome will be capacity of the Qingdao Municipal Government to implement \nsustainable  groundwater  management  in  the  Daguhe  River  Basin  improved.  To  attain  the \nexpected  outcome,  four  outputs  have  been  identified:  (i)  Daguhe  groundwater  resources \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n ", "  3 \nassessment  carried  out,  (ii)  groundwater  resources  information  management  system \nestablished,  (iii)  groundwater  pollution  treatment  options  assessed,  and  (iv)  Daguhe \ngroundwater resources management plan prepared. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Output  1:  Daguhe  groundwater  resources  assessment  carried  out. This output \ninvolves  assessing  the  groundwater  conditions  in  the  Daguhe  aquifer.  While  a  number  of \nindividual studies for the Daguhe aquifer have been conducted by Chinese universities and \nresearch institutes, there is still no comprehensive review and summary of the dynamics and \nconditions in the area. The municipal government still lacks solid analysis and recommendations \nfor  policy  decisions  and  actual  on-the-ground  activities.  With  a  particular  focus  on  nitrate \npollution, the assessment will encompass groundwater availability, usage, and quality. Existing \nstudies will be reviewed and analyzed, and the current extent of groundwater pollution and \ndistribution pattern of the Daguhe aquifer will be determined. This will support in determining the \nsustainable level of extraction.  \n \n12.  Specific activities for output 1 include the following: (i) review, analyze, and summarize \nall existing studies and collected relevant data for the Daguhe groundwater resources, including \nhydrogeology, groundwater flow, meteorology, surface water flow, groundwater abstraction and \ninfiltration, and climate change scenarios; (ii) assess possible climate change impacts on the \nfuture  replenishment  of  Daguhe  groundwater  resources;  (iii)  assess  current  groundwater \nmanagement practices, institutional arrangements, and policies, including licensing and pricing; \nand (iv) summarize the findings of the assessment in a comprehensive baseline data report.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Groundwater resources information management system established. \nThis output involves the consolidation and establishment of a computerized information system \nin  the  Qingdao  Hydrological  Bureau  (QHB).  Based  on  comprehensive  assessment  of  the \nbaseline conditions and recharge dynamics of the aquifer, a database and monitoring system \nneeds  to  be  established  that  will  guide  the  decision-making  and  groundwater  protection \nenforcement processes.4  \n \n14.  Specific activities for output 2 include the following: (i) conduct a review of current water \ninformation systems and assess opportunities for upgrading the existing system; (ii) design and \nprepare specifications for a groundwater resources information system; (iii) procure and install \nthe groundwater database and information system; (iv) provide training for QHB staff on the \norganization, quality control, and data entry of the existing groundwater data; (v) prepare a user \nmanual and provide training for QHB staff on use of the groundwater information system; (vi) \nconduct  consultations  with  local  governments  to  streamline  future  groundwater  monitoring \nprocedures;  and  (vii)  prepare  a  planning  report  and  cost  estimates  for  establishing  an \nautomated digital data collection system.  \n \n15.  Output 3: Groundwater pollution treatment options assessed. This output involves \nreview  of  the  feasible  options  available  to  mitigate  and  rehabilitate  nitrate  pollution  in  the \nDaguhe aquifer. Despite a range of technological options that have been proposed to address \nthe nitrate pollution concerns, there is no systematic assessment and comparison of those \noptions  that  includes  technical,  financial,  and  institutional  aspects.  The  review  will  include \n                                                \n4  The proposed system will consist of standard desktop computers and off-the-shelf software that can easily be \nadapted for use in the Daguhe area. \n ", "4   \nagricultural and environmental engineering options, and assess other initiatives by QHB that the \nmunicipal government is considering for the Daguhe area.  \n \n16.  Specific activities for output 3 include the following: (i) review and summarize agricultural \npractices in the Daguhe area, including irrigation practices, fertilizer usage, and animal waste \ndisposal; (ii) conduct calculations on the influence of various aeration belt structures, irrigation \nmode, and fertilization volume on various crops in various periods over nitrate pollution of the \ngroundwater source; (iii) assess the effect of applying slow-release fertilizer and biological \nfiltration  in  the  Daguhe  area;  (iv)  conduct  a  literature  review  of  current  environmental \nengineering technologies for nitrate removal from groundwater; (v) conduct a financial analysis \nand cost comparison for the potential application of the most suitable technological options; and \n(vi) summarize the findings in a technical report.  \n \n17.  Output 4: Daguhe groundwater resources management plan prepared. This output \ninvolves preparation of a strategic groundwater management plan, including technical options, \nawareness raising, financing options, and institutional and legal requirements. The groundwater \nassessment, information management system, and comparison of technical options will enable \npreparation  of  a  Daguhe  groundwater  management  plan  that  will  support  the  municipal \ngovernment in ensuring adequate groundwater protection and sustainable usage.  \n \n18.  Specific activities for output 4 include the following: (i) conduct a literature review on \nmanaging and protecting groundwater resources that are threatened by nitrate pollution; (ii) \nconduct an international study tour for Qingdao Development and Reform Commission (QDRC) \nand QHB staff to gain international experiences on groundwater resources management and \nprotection;5 (iii) assess water demand scenarios for Qingdao municipality and determine usage \nrecommendations for the Daguhe groundwater resources; (iv) conduct consultations with local \ngovernments on the management options to ensure adequate protection from nitrate pollution; \n(v) develop technical recommendations for the protection and usage of Daguhe groundwater \nresources; (vi) assess institutional, financial, and legal requirements for implementation of the \nplan;  (vii)  prepare  a  public  awareness  and  communications  strategy  to  ensure  full \nimplementation  of  the  plan;  (viii)  conduct  a  forum  to  present  and  discuss  groundwater \nmanagement  options  for  the  Daguhe  area;  (ix)  prepare  a  final  Daguhe  groundwater \nmanagement  plan;  and  (x)  prepare  an  executive  summary  of  the  management  plan  for \npublishing as a knowledge product.6 \n  \n19.  No major risks relating to implementation of the TA have been identified. QDRC has \nexperience in implementing ADB-financed grants. The only minor risk identified involves the \ninstitutional arrangement for managing the Daguhe water resources, which encompasses also \nother government agencies, cities, and counties. This possible risk can be mitigated through (i) \nthe  active  involvement  of  QDRC  as  oversight  agency;  and  (ii)  establishment  of  close \ncooperation with relevant stakeholders at the start of the TA\u2019s implementation, and in particular \nthe Qingdao Municipal Water Resources Management Office and Yantai City. The latter is part \nof the Daguhe River Basin and located upstream of the Daguhe aquifer area.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n5  The study tour will preferably be in an ADB member country (and most preferably a developing member country), \nand it will focus on mitigating nitrate pollution. \n6  It is intended to prepare a short policy brief. \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The proceeds of the \nTA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The government will provide counterpart support in the \nforms of counterpart staff, office facilities, meeting venues, and other in-kind contributions. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  Implementation of the TA will take 18 months, from 1 September 2013 to 28 February \n2015.  QDRC  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  provide  the  necessary  oversight  and \ncoordination  for  implementing  the  TA.  QHB  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  A  project \nmanagement office, to be established at QHB with at least five qualified staff, will be responsible \nfor the overall planning, coordination, and supervision of the TA. The project management office \nwill closely coordinate its activities with the Qingdao municipal water resources management \noffice and Yantai City government, which will be invited to join quarterly coordination meetings \nand workshops organized by the project management office. QDRC will provide ADB with \nbiannual progress reports during the implementation period and a TA completion report within 3 \nmonths of the TA\u2019s completion date.  \n \n22.  QDRC and QHB will be supported by TA-financed international and national consulting \nservices  to  provide  assessments  and  training  in  the  areas  of  groundwater  protection  and \nplanning  while  following  international  good  management  practices.  It  is  estimated  the \nconsultants will include 4 person-months of international experts and 18 person-months of \nnational experts. One consulting firm with international experience will be engaged by ADB \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) \nthrough  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  at  the  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20  using \nsimplified technical proposal procedures. It is anticipated that the consultants will be mobilized \nduring the fourth quarter of 2013. Procurement for the TA will be conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The equipment will be \nhanded over to QHB upon completion of the TA. \n \n23.  Training,  workshops,  and  the  international  study  tour  will  be  organized  by  the \nconsultants and will be included in the contract. The consultants will also support QHB to \nestablish adequate institutional coordination mechanisms and organize quarterly coordination \nmeetings with key stakeholders, including the municipal water resources management office \nand Yantai City government.  \n \n24.  Standard  monitoring  and  supervision  procedures  for  ADB-administered  TA  will  be \nfollowed. Best practices and lessons learned will be disseminated through national workshops, \nvarious technical reports, and a knowledge product to be posted on QDRC and ADB websites.  \n \nIV.
