ADB provided assistance in 1995 to prepare the country\u2019s first education master \nplan,1 and is providing loans to develop postsecondary education2 and skills for employment.3 \nThe education master plan assessed the education sector and put forward recommendations for \nthe period 1996\u20132005.   \n \n2.  At the Government\u2019s request, ADB agreed to include in its country strategy and program \nfor  Maldives  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  assist  the  education  sector.4  In  follow-up to \ndiscussions between the Government of Maldives and the ADB Country Programming Mission, \nthe TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Mal\u00e9 from 25\u201328 January 2004. The Government requested \nthe Mission for assistance to specific activities in support of its three-year strategic action plan \ntoward Vision 2020. Discussions were held with representatives from the Ministry of Finance \nand Treasury (MOFT), the  Ministry of Planning and National Development, the Ministry of \nEducation  (MOE),  and  the  Department  of  External  Resources.  The  purpose  and  outputs, \nmethodology  and  key  activities,  cost  estimates,  financing  arrangements,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference are the result of the understanding with the Government \nduring the mission. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Maldives education system comprises 7 years of primary education, 3 years of \nlower  secondary  education,  2  years  of  higher  secondary  education,  and  postsecondary \neducation.  Short-term  and  long-term  technical  education  and  vocational  training  are  also \navailable, and offer three certificate levels, diploma, and higher diploma. At the end of the lower \nsecondary and higher secondary schooling, students typically sit for the ordinary-level (O-level) \nand  the  advanced-level  (A-level)  examinations.  Teachers  in  primary  schools  are  mainly \nMaldivians, many of whom are untrained. Teachers in the secondary grades are primarily \nexpatriates. The World Bank is assisting the Maldives to train its primary education teachers, \nimprove the quality of primary education, and expand the provision of secondary education.  \nADB is assisting with the development of postsecondary education and skills development for \nemployment.  \n \n4.  In its Vision 2020,5 the Maldives aims to achieve universal basic education comprising \ngrades 1 to 10. With the Government\u2019s commitment to education, the Maldives achieved \nuniversal primary education in the 1990s.6 After this significant achievement, the education \nsystem has been expanding its lower secondary education and higher secondary education. \nBetween 1995 and 2003, enrollment in grades 8 through 10 more than tripled, from 6,993 to \n25,486 students. During the same period, the number of schools offering lower secondary \neducation went from 58 to 100. Most of this expansion took place in the atolls where most of the \nMaldives\u2019 population live. Correspondingly, the number of students completing lower secondary \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20 January 2004. \n5  http://www.planning.gov.mv/vision2020.htm. \n6  In 2003, over 66,000 children were enrolled in primary education. ", "2  \nschooling  has  significantly  increased  and  continues  to  grow.  Between  1998  and  2003,  \nthe number of students enrolled in grade 10 more than tripled, from 2,114 to 6,870. However, \nduring  the  same  period,  because  of  the  limited  number  of  higher  secondary  schools  \n(five nationwide), only one in eight students was able to progress to grade 11. Higher secondary \nenrollment is expected to increase as the Government, in 2004, gave 20 atoll schools the \nopportunity to offer higher secondary education.7  \n \n5.  School expansion designed to achieve universal basic education places stress on the \nsystem's capacity to deliver quality and efficient education at an affordable price. Expansion in \nthe  Maldives  is  exposing  more  bottlenecks,  highlighting  the  weaknesses  of  the  system.  \nThese require immediate action, which the Government intends to undertake. At present,  \n(i)  mechanisms  to  increase  access  to  postsecondary  education  within  the  framework  of \nsustainable education financing need examination, (ii) the capacity for materials development \nfor grades 8 to 10 has to be developed, and (iii) a legal framework supporting education plans \nand goals is not in place. \n \n6.  The Government is committed to sustainable human development; in 2002, over 40% of \nthe budget was spent on the social sectors. Primary, lower secondary, and higher secondary \neducation are mainly provided and financed by the Government. With increasing numbers of \nstudents  completing  grades  10  and  12,  there  is  greater  demand  for  placements  in \npostsecondary and higher education institutions. Some students may secure scholarships to \nstudy abroad while others may be able to pay to study in a foreign country or at the Maldives \nCollege of Higher Education (MCHE). As the demand for improving the quality of primary \neducation  and  expanding  and  improving  secondary  education  on  the  Government  budget \nincreases,  there  is  greater  pressure  for  cost  sharing  in  postsecondary  education  for \nsustainability, efficiency, and equity. At present, although many MCHE students are supported \nby the Government, cost-sharing initiatives are in place and will likely continue. Fewer foreign \nscholarship places will be available in the future, placing more burden on students and their \nfamilies to finance higher education. This represents a significant financial outlay by families, \nespecially in the atolls where incomes are about half of those in Mal\u00e9. As the number of \nstudents graduating from higher secondary schools increases and as more of students come \nfrom poorer families in the atolls, the Government is keen to explore ways, including student \nloan schemes, in which postsecondary education can be made more accessible while being \nsustainably financed. \n \n7.  The focus on lower secondary education is on expansion and on improved quality.  \nAt present, the performance of students sitting for the O-level exams needs much improvement. \nOnly about 50% of students pass most subjects, and less than 10% of students pass some of \nthe subject. Performance is worse for students educated in the atolls. The poor performance of \nstudents in the exams, particularly in the atolls, is partly attributed to the ineffectiveness of \nlearning materials.8 Except in Islamic studies, fisheries science, and Dhivehi, all other learning \nmaterials, including textbooks, are sourced and bought from abroad.9 Some of the examples \nand illustrations in imported materials used are not relevant to the Maldives, which challenges \nthe students' abilities to comprehend and subsequently apply the learning.

Technical Assistance \nPerformance Audit Report on Selected Technical Assistance in the Education Sector in Three Central Asian \nRepublics. Manila. \n9  In addition, families typically spend over $78.125 (Rf1,000) per student per school year from grades 8 to 10 to \npurchase prescribed ordinary-level (O-level) textbooks, which is a significant financial burden to most families. ", "    3 \nrelevance to the Maldivian context of subjects being learned, and thus increase comprehension \nof concepts and knowledge being imparted, MOE wants to be able to develop teaching and \nlearning materials for the lower secondary grades. MOE has developed the curriculum and the \nteaching and learning materials for grades 1 to 7, but lacks the capacity to do so for grades 8  \nto 10. \n \n8.  With the expansion of the education system and increased demand for education, \nseveral issues have emerged, including, education financing, regulation of  private education \nand training providers, roles of communities, and standards. MOE has developed regulations \nand policies in response to specific situations on hand. However, no overall legal framework \ngoverns the education sector, the responsibilities and accountabilities of MOE, the legal status \nof  public  providers,  regulation  of  private  providers,  financing  and  budget  provisions, \nexaminations, student representation, and academic freedom. These need to be addressed in a \nsystematic, technically sound manner based on legislation that ensures equal opportunity to \nquality standards at affordable prices.           \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  To  assist  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  achieve  the  goals  in  Maldives\u2019  Vision  2020,  \nthe ADB poverty partnership agreement, and the Millennium Development Goals, the TA will \nsupport provision of basic education for all through the development of a solid legal, financial, \nand  curriculum  framework.  The  TA  will  assist  MOE  to  (i)  develop  a  legal  framework  for \neducation, including universal basic education, for the country; (ii) analyze options for making \npostsecondary education affordable to students within the framework of sustainable financing of \neducation; and (iii) build capacity at MOE to develop teaching and learning materials for grades \n8 to 10. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will comprise three components: (i) developing education sector legislation to \nassist the Maldives to attain its Vision 2020 education goals; (ii) developing and recommending \nalternatives for making postsecondary education financially accessible to more students under a \nsystem of sustainable financing, including student loan schemes; and (iii) building capacity at \nMOE to develop and assess teaching and learning materials for the lower secondary grades. \n \n11.  The  education  sector  legislation  will  be  developed  in  consultation  with  major \nstakeholders, and taking into account the best international practices in facilitating, regulating, \nproviding,  and  financing  education  and  training,  including  the  role  of  the  public  sector  in \nfinancing  and  provision.  Education-related  legislation  and  regulations  and  international \nconventions will be reviewed. The Government\u2019s education policy, priority, and reform needs will \nbe assessed. The draft legislation will be specific on issues such as the legal status of public \nproviders, examinations, approval of foreign certificates and degrees, access, student rights and \nobligations, students\u2019 financial contributions, role of the state, financing and budget provisions, \nand  regulation  of  private  providers.  The  TA  will  also  assist  the  Government  to  develop \nguidelines to implement the legislation\u2019s provisions.   \n \n12.  Alternatives  to  making  postsecondary  education  accessible  and  affordable  to  more \nstudents,  including  student  loan  schemes,  will  be  examined  in  the  context  of  sustainable ", "4  \nfinancing of education. Consultations with major stakeholders, including local banks, will be \nconducted.  Lessons  learned  in  other  countries,  particularly  on  implementing  student  loan \nschemes and on the issue of equity, will be taken into account. A survey of capacity- and \nwillingness-to-pay will be conducted among a representative sample of students from Mal\u00e9 and \nthe atolls. The TA will assess the feasibility of student loan schemes and other options, and \nrecommend  appropriate  action.  A  corresponding  proposal  for  an  expenditure  plan  for \nimplementation will be developed.  \n \n13.  The capacity at MOE to assess and develop materials for lower secondary education \nsubjects will be strengthened through in-country training. Learning and teaching materials will \nbe assessed vis-\u00e0-vis the national examinations and the curricula with a view to increasing their \nrelevance to the Maldives. Materials for subjects in the commerce and science streams will be \ngiven priority in the training program.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $412,000 equivalent, of which $290,000 will be \nforeign exchange costs and $122,000 equivalent will be local currency costs. ADB will finance \n$350,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign currency costs and $60,000 equivalent in \nlocal currency costs. The remaining  $62,000 will be contributed by the Government and will \ninclude office accommodations, transportation, counterpart staff remuneration and per diem, \nand  others.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB's  TA  funding  program.  \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are found in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOFT will be the Executing Agency for the TA. MOE will be the Implementing Agency. \nMOE will organize a steering committee that will comprise representatives from MOFT, Ministry \nof  Planning  and  National  Development,  Ministry  of  Atolls  Development,  Ministry  of  Youth \nDevelopment  and  Sports,  Ministry  of  Employment  and  Labor,  Ministry  of  Gender,  Family \nDevelopment  and  Social  Security,  MCHE, private providers, private sector employers, and \nschool boards. The steering committee will lead the consultation process with other agencies, \nclarify  emerging  issues  and  policies,  coordinate  and  facilitate  TA  activities,  and  provide \nguidance to consultants. The steering committee will meet at least three times during TA \nimplementation. \n  \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 8 months. Consulting services from \nspecialists will be rendered from January to August 2005. The TA will employ the services of \nthree international (8 person-months) and three domestic consultants (11 person-months), for a \ntotal  of  19  person-months.  The  international  consultants  will  be  specialists  in  education \nlegislation,  financing  of  higher  education  and  student  loan  schemes,  and  curriculum  and \nmaterials development and student academic performance. The domestic consultants will be \nspecialists in drafting Maldivian legislation and education finance. The consultants will work with \nMOE counterparts who will be identified before consultants commence work. The consultants \nwill be engaged by ADB through a firm, using quality-and-cost-based selection, in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nthe engagement of domestic consultants. The simplified technical proposal will be used. Outline \nterms of reference are in Appendix 3.   \n \n17.  The team will submit an inception report no later than 3 weeks after fielding, a midterm \nreport  10  weeks  after  inception,  and  a  draft  final  report  7  months  after  inception.
