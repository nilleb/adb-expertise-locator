Developing  information  and  communications  technology  (ICT)  is  a  priority  in  all \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the East and \nCentral Asia Region. Integrating ICT in basic education is a key component of their strategy. \nThe technical assistance (TA) is listed in the Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program \nUpdate (RCSPU) 2006\u20132008. The TA is based on consultations with government agencies in \nthe participating countries (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and \nUzbekistan)  that  will  be  major  stakeholders  in  the  TA.  Fact-finding  was  conducted  during \nSeptember  and  October  2005  through  (i)  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  to  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz \nRepublic, and Uzbekistan; and (ii) consultation by resident missions in Azerbaijan, Mongolia, \nand Tajikistan.1 The Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) will provide parallel financing for \nand support the implementation of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Aligning education to the changing needs of the labor market is a long-term challenge for \nthe Central Asian countries in their transition to a market-based economy. Integrating ICT in \neducation is a key component in meeting this challenge. International experience shows that the \nappropriate use of ICT helps students improve their learning achievements, learn more in less \ntime, and develop positive attitudes toward and strengthen their motivation for learning. In \nparticular, effective ICT use promotes student-centered learning and helps to develop higher \norder  thinking  and  independent  learning  skills.  These  are  crucial  for  lifelong  learning  and \nadapting to changing labor market demands. In addition, these are essential conditions for long- \nterm economic development, and vital for national competitiveness in a world economy that is \nbecoming increasingly integrated and information- and knowledge-based. \n \n3.  Keenly  aware  of  the  substantial  benefits  that  ICT  could  bring,  the  participating \ncountries  accord  high  priority  to  ICT  development  in  education  within  their  broad  national \ndevelopment  frameworks.2 Some  countries  have  made  significant  investments  in  ICT  in \neducation  in  the  past.  However,  ICT  including  the  internet  remains  underused  and \nunderdeveloped in the region. Given the common past shared by the education systems of the \nparticipating countries and their diverse pace and progress in ICT development, there will be \nsignificant value in (i) exchanging experiences and lessons learned within the region; and (ii) \nbenefiting from experience and lessons in integrating ICT in education from other regions of the \nworld.   \n \n4.  ADB is well-positioned to assist in this regional endeavor, with its experience in both \nregional cooperation and ICT in education. Promoting ICT in education is a focus of ADB\u2019s \neducation sector strategy. Ongoing regional activities relating to ICT in education include (i) an \nannual conference on ICT in education since 2004; (ii) a major study published in 2005;3 and (iii) \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 9 September 2005. \n2  The National Information and Communication Technologies Strategy for the Development of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan  (2003\u20132012),  the  Main  Directions  and  the  Mechanism  for  Implementation  of  the  Program--\nInformatization of Education of the \"Governmental Program on the Development of Education for 2005\u20132010\" of \nthe Republic of Kazakhstan, the National Strategy \u201cInformation Communication Technologies for the Development \nof Kyrgyz Republic,\u201d the Policy Paper \u201cVision for the Development of Information and Communication Technology \nuntil  2010\u201d  of  Mongolia,  the  State\u2019s  Strategy  \u201cInformation  Communication  Technologies  for  Developing  the \nRepublic of Tajikistan,\u201d the \u201cICT in Basic Education Strategy\u201d of Uzbekistan.  \n3  ADB. 2005.

ADB  has  assisted  the  Government  of  Uzbekistan  in \ndeveloping a comprehensive 10-year ICT development strategy in basic education. In addition, \nADB has gained the support and confidence of the participating countries in the region in \npromoting  and  supporting  regional  cooperation  including  in  the  education  sector. 5 This \nextensive experience provides a solid foundation for the proposed regional TA. The TA will \ntherefore provide a keenly needed regional forum for promoting learning and exchange of \nexperience in ICT in basic education. ADBI\u2019s participation will allow the TA to benefit from \nADBI\u2019s  considerable  experience  and  expertise  in  (i)  e-learning  materials  development  and \ncapacity building; (ii) development and application of distance learning capacity, which has \nimportant implications for Central Asia in terms of equitable access to quality education; and (iii) \nthe integration of ICT in basic education in advanced economies through international experts. \nThe experience and role of ADBI are described in Appendix 2.  \n \n5.  Based on the experience of the participating countries to date in integrating ICT in basic \neducation,  a  number  of  key  issues  will  need  to  be  successfully  addressed  to  reap  the \nsubstantial potential benefits from ICT use in schools.  \n \n6.  Education System Preparedness. ICT is a tool for improving the accessibility, quality, \nand relevance of education. To achieve these educational objectives requires a wide-ranging \nset  of  conditions  including  an  ICT-based  curriculum,  education  standards  and  assessment \nsystem; a majority of teachers adept at ICT use in a multiple of subjects across the curriculum; \nabundant  e-learning  materials;  and  an  adequate  learning  environment  at  the  school  level. \nDeveloping  these  conditions  for  the  effective  use  of  ICT  in  schools  will  take  time.  While \ncurriculum-related reforms have been under way in all participating countries since the early \n1990s, much remains to be done. Although pre-service and in-service teacher training has \nimproved  in  terms  of  incentives  and  remuneration,  teacher-centered  methodologies  and \nclassroom  practices  continue  to  dominate.  In  addition,  underfunded  school  buildings  and \nclassrooms, where the fiscal budget and financial situations are challenging, pose difficulties in \nproviding appropriate physical conditions for effective ICT use.  \n \n7.  Financial Sustainability. Integrating ICT in basic education is costly. The total cost of \nownership (TCO) includes the initial investment for ICT facilities and their replacement over time; \ndirect recurrent costs including consumables, and operation and maintenance; and indirect \nrecurrent costs (e.g., materials development for e-learning, teacher training and retraining). \nInternet connectivity as a key component of ICT is still costly in the targeted countries. To a \nlarge extent, it is the high TCO that has to date prevented more expanded use of ICT in \neducation in the region. Even in those participating countries with more advanced experience in \nICT in schools, how to effectively budget the costs and allocate sufficient financial resources to \nschools within a decentralized education financing system remains a challenge.  \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005. Innovative Information and Communication Technology in Education, and Its Potential for Reducing \nPoverty. Manila. For synergy and complementarities, the TA will closely coordinate with these ongoing ADB \ninitiatives during implementation. The TA will also coordinate closely with other development partners including the \nUnited Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which is finalizing a Toolkit for ICT in \nEducation; and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which is pilot testing ICT in selected \nschools in Uzbekistan. \n5  ADB. 2004.  Technical Assistance for Subregional Cooperation in Managing Education Reforms. Manila. \n ", "  3\n8.  Technological and Infrastructure Development. Technological development in ICT is \naccelerating,  resulting  in  ever  more  user-friendly,  durable  and  cheaper  equipment  and \napplications, and improved connectivity (e.g., wireless systems). These developments have \nimportant  implications  for  reducing  TCO,  improving  financial  sustainability,  and  lessening \ndependence on heavy infrastructure. The implications of such technological developments will \nneed to be explored with special reference to the participating countries where infrastructure as \nrequired by the traditional personal computer-based paradigm is underdeveloped or under-used.   \nAccelerating technological advances also offer potential opportunities for leapfrogging of the \ntraditional approach of ICT in education in the participating countries. \n \n9.  Equitable Access. Ensuring equitable access to quality basic education is a stated goal \nof each of the participating countries. ICT offers some of the best ways for its delivery. This is \nparticularly important for Central Asian countries with low population density and challenging \nterrains and geographical conditions. However, ICT tends to develop first and fastest in urban \nand affluent areas. To use ICT effectively in improving access to quality education in rural and \nremote  areas  while  preventing  and  breaking  through  the  internal  digital  divide  will  require \ntargeted policies and interventions. Exploring new and future technological developments will \nalso be part of the potential solutions.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the TA is to increase the effectiveness of investments in ICT in basic \neducation for improved education opportunities and closer alignment with labor market needs in \nthe participating DMCs. The outcome of the TA is enhanced capacity of the participating DMCs \nto plan and effectively implement projects and programs for ICT in basic education.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Capacity  Building  and  Process  Approach.  Consistent  with  the  TA  outcome, \ndeveloping indigenous capacity is a key TA activity. For effectiveness, the TA will follow a \nprocess approach to capacity building throughout TA implementation. In particular, participating \nimplementing agencies (IAs) will be responsible for developing the products in their respective \ncountries, while the consultants will serve as facilitators. This learning-by-doing approach will be \nmore effective than training in short workshops and seminars. Working meetings at the national \nlevel will be held as part of capacity building. Given the centralized decision-making structure in \nmany of the participating countries, capacity building will target ministries and agencies of the \ncentral Government, supported by wider consultations involving other stakeholders during the \nprocess  including  nongovernment  organizations  especially  with  regard  to  community \nparticipation, and industry representatives focusing on technological development and public-\nprivate partnerships. Key baseline data for monitoring and evaluation will be established during \nthe first 2 months of TA implementation.  \n \n12.  Implementation Phases. The TA will be implemented in three phases over 18 months, \nstarting  from  April  2006:  (i)  research  and  development  (months  1\u201310);  (ii)  exchange  of \nexperiences  and  lessons  (months  3\u20132);  and  (iii)  finalization  of  the  integrated  knowledge \nproducts  (months  11\u201318).  Overlapping  of  phases  will  allow  continuity  and  flexibility  in \nimplementation. \n \n \n ", "4   \n13.  Research Development. Each national team consisting of key stakeholders (ministries \nof education, finance, and telecommunication) will develop its own work plan and research \ndesigns. The research methodology and work plan will be finalized in a regional meeting, which \nwill bring all participating countries together to ensure coordination of research scope and \ntimelines. The research will then be carried out in each country through a comprehensive study \nand compilation of cases. A working meeting bringing together all relevant major stakeholders in \nthe field of ICT in basic education in the country will be held, with other working meetings \nplanned during the process for enhancing capacity building (the number of meetings will vary \naccording to national needs). The outputs of the research activities carried out at the national \nlevel will include (i) a country report on the status of ICT for each participating country, and (ii) a \nset of case studies and lessons learned for each country, with special focus on the issues \ndiscussed above. These outputs will be the basis for developing issue papers on (i) financial \nplanning  and  sustainability;  (ii)  methodology  and  pedagogy;  (iii)  analysis  and  investments \nplanning; (iv) social inclusion (with special focus on remote communities and disabled children); \n(v)  school  management  and  community  involvement;  and  (vi)  private  sector  participation \n(depending on capacity and interest, a country may develop papers on one or more issues).  \n \n14.  Public Forum and Exchange of Experiences. Country studies, issue papers, and \nanalytical  tools  produced  during  the  research  phase  will  be  shared  at  an  international \nconference. The international conference will be a TA\u2019s main vehicle both for knowledge and \nexperience sharing and capacity building. The conference will be organized in partnership with \nADBI, benefiting from the knowledge and experience developed in other countries and other \nsectors of ICT. At the international conference, the participating countries will present their \nexperiences, and stakeholders from the region, funding agencies, and civil society involved in \nICT  projects  in  basic  education,  together  with  international  experts,  will  add  value  to  the \nresearch results and in planning ways forward. The conference will also provide capacity\u2013\nbuilding opportunities by organizing workshops with ADBI and international experts on each of \nthe issues related to ICT in basic education. \n \n15.  Finalization of the Integrated Knowledge Products. All reports, issue papers, and \nanalytical tools, together with the inputs of the international conference, will serve as content \nmaterials for producing an integrated set of knowledge products on ICT in basic education for \ndevelopment  results\u2014providing  a  comprehensive  framework  for  analysis,  planning,  and \nevaluation. The knowledge products will include (i) a regional report on the status of ICT \ndevelopment in basic education in the region emphasizing experiences, issues, and lessons \nlearned;  (ii)  several  issue  papers  covering  the  issues  and  benefits  of  investments  in  ICT \n(financial  planning  and  sustainability;  educational  benefits;  technological  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  investment  planning;  social  inclusion;  school  governance,  management,  and \ncapacity building); and (iii) tools for policy analysis and planning. The knowledge products will \nbe  developed  for  future  use  by  government  officials  and  other  stakeholders  for  effective \nplanning, implementation, and evaluation of ICT activities in basic education. Once the products \nare finalized, they will be launched in each of the participating countries at a working meeting \nthat will also serve as a national capacity\u2013building activity. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $900,000 equivalent. The amount of $600,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program, $100,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADBI through parallel cofinancing, and the governments of the \nparticipating DMCs will jointly contribute a total of $200,000 in kind. Detailed cost estimates are \nin Appendix 3. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA (Social Sectors Division, East and Central \nand Asia Department), and the Ministry of Education (or its equivalent) in each participating \ncountry will be the IA.6  Each IA will identify a person as the government focal point (GFP) within \nthe ministry. The GFPs will work in close cooperation with representatives of the ministry in \ncharge of economic planning and the budget7 and the Ministry of Information Technology (or the \nequivalent agency)8 and other relevant government bodies contributing to develop ICT in the \nbasic education sector. The GFPs should have experience and expertise in national education \npolicy and ICT policy. They will work in close coordination with the consultant team and will \nparticipate in all TA activities, providing all support as necessary, including inputs, data for \npreparing country report and issue papers, coordinating with all relevant stakeholders, and \nassisting in organizing all meetings. Outline terms of reference (TOR) for the GFPs are in \nAppendix 4.  \n \n18.  The  TA  will  require  the  services  of  one  international  consultant  (an  education \nspecialist/team leader with specific experience and knowledge of ICT in basic education sector \nissues in the region) for a total of 6 person-months, and six country coordinators for a total of 60 \nperson-months. The country coordinators will have research and analytical skills, knowledge of \nICT issues in the basic education sector, and capacity to relate to different aspects of the issues \nof ICT. The consultant team will work in collaboration with the GFPs and relevant counterpart \nstaff of the participating countries. The international consultant and the six country coordinators \nwill be engaged by ADB through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection with full technical \nproposals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Appendix 4 gives the \noutline TOR for consulting services. \n \n19.  The country reports, issue papers, and analytical tools for planning investments in ICT in \nbasic education will be shared at the international conference, which will take place during \nmonth 12 of implementation. The integrated knowledge products, and results of the research \nactivities  and  the  international  conference  will  be  disseminated  in  all  countries  in  English, \nRussian,  and  the  national  languages.  The  knowledge  products  will  be  published  with  a \nmultimedia format (printed and CD-ROM version) and will be launched in each participating \ncountry, and at the regional level through the ADB website and other regional websites.  \n \nIV.
