INTRODUCTION  \n1.  During the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country programming mission in Manila in \nDecember 2011, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested ADB to \nprovide policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to help the Gansu provincial government \n(GPG) in improving the legislation and policy support system for eco-compensation in Gansu \nProvince.1 This TA was then included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for \nthe  PRC. 2  In  April  2012,  an  ADB  mission  visited  Gansu  Province,  and  reached  an \nunderstanding with the GPG on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, costs estimates and financing \nplan, implementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The TA design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA builds on achievements of past ADB projects, \nand draws lessons from these TA projects to support  the GPG\u2019s efforts in enhancing the \nprovincial eco-compensation legislation and policy framework.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The concept of payment for ecosystem services (PES) acknowledges that ecosystem \ncan provide benefits to human beings as \"ecosystem services.\"3 Costa Rica, with its 1996 \nForest  Law,  was  the  first  country  to  legally  establish  and  regulate  payments  for  forest \necosystem services. Following the adoption of this law, academic attention to the concept of \nPES  and  the  implementation  of  initiatives  designed  to  test  its  basic  premises  increased \ndramatically. The publication in 2005 of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment\u2014with its main \nfindings focused on reversing the degradation of ecosystem services and identifying options to \nenhance them\u2014further developed the theory and practice of PES, and the legal support for its \nimplementation.4 \n \n3.  PES is a generic name for a variety of arrangements through which the beneficiaries of \necosystem  services  pay  the  providers  of  those  services.  There  is  no  generally  accepted \ndefinition for PES, and the term itself is not used by all who implement the concept. The words \nused in individual countries to translate and describe the concept depend on the language and \nother cultural and political factors.  \n \n4.  In the PRC, the traditional approach to ensure the provision of ecosystem services and \necological restoration and management has been through eco-compensation payments made \ndirectly from the government to service providers. Eco-compensation-related mechanisms and \nregulations in the PRC historically have been mainly limited to local areas. However, since 2005, \nthe State Council has been giving top priority to, and urging the establishment of, effective \nnational eco-compensation mechanisms to support ecological restoration and management. In \n2008, the government stressed the need for an incentive mechanism that will facilitate the \nprotection of natural resources such as arable lands, watersheds, forests, grasslands, wetlands, \nand agricultural species resources. A range of eco-compensation programs are now being \nimplemented across different provinces in the PRC, including a forest ecological compensation \nfund  and  an  emission  trading  program.  In  a  recent  study,  it  was  noted  that  some  richer \nprovinces\u2014Fujian,  Guangdong,  Jiangsu,  Liaoning,  and  Zhejiang\u2014are  where  most  local \nactivities  and  innovations  on  eco-compensation  are  happening.  Case  studies  on  poorer \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 September 2012. \n2  ADB. 2012.

Ecological Economics \n69:1,209\u201318.  \n4  Available at: http://www.maweb.org/en/index.aspx \n ", "2   \nprovinces\u2014Gansu, Jiangxi, and Qinghai\u2014and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region revealed \nthat eco-compensation activities were more dependent on central government programs and \nfunding.5   \n \n5.  Gansu Province gives high importance to eco-compensation. Along with other sector \nagencies, the Gansu Provincial Forestry Department (GFD) has particularly made efforts to \ninclude  eco-compensation  mechanisms  in  its  policies  and  regulatory  framework.  Several \nregulations related to eco-compensation have been issued at three different levels, i.e., local \nregulations,  governmental  management  measures,  and  official  documents  issued  by  the \nprovincial government. There are six different rules and regulations related to eco-compensation: \n(i) implementation solutions to the forest law, (ii) ordinance for the protection of the Qilian \nMountain Nature Reserve, (iii) ordinance on grasslands of Gansu Province, (iv) ordinance on \nforest  ecological  and  environmental  protection  of  Gansu  Province,  (v)  ordinance  for  water \nresources  management  in  the  Shiyang  River  basin,  and  (vi)  ordinance  on  ecological  and \nenvironmental protection in oil exploration and exploitation. \n \n6.  Despite the existence of these legal provisions to deal with eco-compensation, the main \nchallenges which remain are that the existing principles and legal provisions are too general, \nand lack clarity on the operations of the existing legal provisions. This TA will build on the \nexperiences and lessons learnt from the various ongoing and recently completed initiatives on \neco-compensation in the PRC and also the assessment on the provincial legislative, regulatory, \nand  policy  framework  that  was  conducted  under  the  PRC\u2013Global  Environment  Facility \nPartnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems.6 The proposed plan for an improved \nlegal  and  policy  framework  and  enhanced  capacity  for  implementing  eco-compensation \nmechanisms resulting from this TA will contribute to improving environmental sustainability in \nGansu Province. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA will support the GPG\u2019s effort in enhancing the provincial eco-compensation \nlegislation  and  policy  framework.  The  expected  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  enhanced \nenvironmental sustainability in Gansu Province. The expected outcome of the TA will be an \nimproved legislative framework for eco-compensation in Gansu Province. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Output 1: Eco-compensation approaches for forests and grasslands. The TA will \nreview existing methodologies used for assessment of forest and grassland ecosystem services \nin the PRC and other countries, and provide recommendations on development of appropriate \nmethodologies for Gansu Province. Rapid assessments will be conducted through pilot studies \nin selected forest and grassland sites to capture broader ecosystems services provided and \nimplications for water resources management and associated issues.

Output 3: Enhanced institutional capacity on eco-compensation of forests and \ngrasslands. Specific suboutputs and activities will include \n(i)  development of training and awareness-raising materials for key stakeholders;9  \n                                                \n7  The Xiaolongshan Forestry Experimental Bureau, a state-owned tree farm, has been selected as a pilot site for \nforest eco-compensation, and Tianzhu County has been selected as a pilot site for grassland eco-compensation. \n8  ADB has supported the Beijing environment exchange to develop the Panda Standard, a national standard which \nfacilitates the trading of voluntary emission reduction credits from agriculture and forestry projects. The TA will \nexplore inclusion of carbon trading as an instrument for eco-compensation.  \n9  Key stakeholder groups include (i) provincial officials; (ii) county government staff, including agencies related to \nagriculture, environmental protection, forestry, and nature reserve management bureaus; and (iii) grassroots \ncommunities and herders.  \n ", "4   \n(ii)  implementation of the training programs through conduct of a provincial training \nworkshop, an international study tour,10 and several grassroots-level workshops \nand awareness-raising seminars; and \n(iii)  preparation of a glossy information booklet on eco-compensation mechanisms \nand approaches in Gansu Province for sustainable management of forests and \ngrasslands. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources).  \n \n12.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, office supplies, domestic transportation, workshop costs, administrative support, and \nother in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from 1 November 2012 to 30 April 2014. \nThe Gansu Provincial Finance Bureau (GFB) will be the executing agency. The director of the \nInternational Division of the GFB will be the focal point within the executing agency. The GFD \nwill be the implementing agency. The Global Environment Facility Office under the GFD will \nfunction as the TA management office to coordinate day-to-day TA operations. A full-time \nproject  officer  will  be  recruited  by  the  GFD  to  serve  as  the  overall  manager  of  the  TA \nresponsible  for  coordination  matters  among  ADB,  consultants,  and  related  government \nagencies. \n \n14.  A steering committee will be established to provide guidance on TA implementation \nissues and ensuring interagency coordination.
