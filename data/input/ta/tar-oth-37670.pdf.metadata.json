The new Pacific Strategy 2005\u201320091 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) stresses \nthe  importance  of  encouraging  greater  participation,  particularly  of  women  and youth, in \ngovernance and government. Findings of the country governance assessments (CGA),2 a \nregional governance workshop3 and a Fact-Finding Mission to the Fiji Islands and Vanuatu in \nNovember\u2013December 2003 indicated that few mechanisms are currently in place to encourage \ncivil society to participate in the resource allocation process. Government officials during the \nFact-Finding  Mission  expressed  strong  interest  in  greater  civil  society  involvement,  but \nhighlighted  the  importance  of  increased  budget  literacy  as  a  prerequisite  for  constructive \nengagement. Regional technical assistance (TA) 61264 focuses on the development of general \ntraining material on budget literacy and on capacity development for national-level government \nstaff and civil society organizations (CSOs) in several regional workshops.  \n \n2.  This TA will review the lessons of TA 6126 and extend the capacity development \nactivities to more stakeholders in the two proposed pilot countries, the Fiji Islands and Vanuatu. \nBy enhancing the capacity of civil society, government officials, elected representatives, and \ntraditional leaders in budget literacy and advocacy, and participatory methodologies, the TA \naims  to  strengthen  the  enabling  environment  for  more  responsive  and  pro-poor  resource \nallocation and to facilitate the institutionalization of a participatory approach. Funding for the TA \nwas endorsed at the Third Strategy Meeting of the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund in July \n2003. The TA's goals, purpose, and scope are summarized in the TA framework (Appendix 1).5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.    Lack of access to and declining quality of basic social services have been cited as \nimportant factors contributing to hardship in participatory poverty assessments conducted in \neight  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs).6  There  are  significant  disparities  in \ndelivery of basic social services, which often fail to reach the outer islands, rural areas, urban \nsquatter settlements, and the most vulnerable, particularly women and the youth. Given the \ngeographic features of the Pacific and the perceived and actual remoteness of the national \nGovernment to the areas where government services are most needed, strengthening the \nlinkages  between  the  community,  provincial,  and  national  governance  levels  and  the \nparticipation of civil society at the various levels are essential to improve basic social service \ndelivery.  \n \n4.  Involving civil society in the resource allocation process can contribute to government \naccountability and to the integration of a pro-poor perspective of the annual budget and planning \ndocuments.7 The CGAs and TA 60658 highlighted the lack of coordination and communication \n_______________________ \n1 See Initiating Paper of 24 March 2004, ADB. 2004.

Furthermore, \nthe findings suggested (i) a lack of understanding by members of the selected communities of \nthe national resource allocation processes and institutions and how communities can avail \nthemselves of opportunities for better social service delivery, outside the traditional system of \nkin/family connection to the elected national leaders; and (ii) incompatibility between currently \npracticed governance, with its top down approach, unilateral decision making, corruption and \ninadequate  service  delivery;  and  community  governance  traditions.  Traditional  governance \nsystems, while consensual among leaders, are seen as hierarchical and male dominated, often \nmarginalizing women and the youth. The findings suggest that a more inclusive approach in \ndetermining service priorities and modes of delivery will make outcomes more targeted and \nresponsive to the demands of the most vulnerable. \n \n5.  In the Fiji Islands, several CSOs are active in lobbying the government to become more \nresponsive to the needs of the poor, yet their submissions to the national government are \nlargely ad hoc. A few CSOs and government agencies are also engaged in building the capacity \nof civil society and in teaching basic economic literacy. However, there is  no coordination \nbetween grassroots concerns and those of provincial and national governments. In Vanuatu, \ncivil society has participated in reviewing the progress of the Comprehensive Reform Program, \nyet there is no involvement in the annual budget process. Several ministries provide a small \namount of resources to CSOs for project implementation yet input into policy, planning, and \nbudgeting is minimal. There is also no structure that links the communities' voices to the \nprovincial or national government. In both countries, capacity development for civil society in \nbudget literacy and advocacy skills, and capacity building for government and elected officials \nand traditional leaders in the benefits of participatory methodologies are a prerequisite and one \nof  the  many  steps  necessary  to  institutionalize  more  inclusive  planning  and  budgeting \nprocesses. \n \n6.  In discussions with government officials and civil society representatives, it was agreed \nthat the TA would pilot a participatory approach to decision making in resource allocation and \nmonitoring in selected communities and in one ministry or related ministries. The TA will directly \nencourage the poor and their representatives in at least 15 selected pilot communities to get \ninvolved in the resource allocation process. An integrated approach will be used to match the \nselected pilot communities and pilot ministries at the respective administrative levels. Capacity \nbuilding activities will jointly involve civil society, government representatives, elected officials \nand traditional leaders. In the Fiji Islands, the TA will focus on the Ministry of Education; Ministry \nof Women, Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation; and Ministry of Youth and Sports. These \nministries  have  overlapping  mandates,  particularly  in  relation  to  poverty  reduction  and \nemployment  creation,  and  have  already  some  reform  champions  or  related  initiatives.  In \nVanuatu, the approach will be piloted in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, whose Department of \nProvincial Affairs is currently carrying out the Rural Economic Development Initiative in two \nprovinces. The initiative emphasizes the economic needs of rural communities identified by the \ncommunities; the resulting proposals are then submitted for Government assistance. However, \nthe initiative's success has been constrained by a lack of capacity that would support and \nsustain a participatory approach. The suggestion is therefore to build on the initiative and to \nstrengthen the capacity of the involved stakeholders for a genuinely participatory process.  \n \n7.  Lessons from the pilot communities and ministries will be exchanged in several outreach \nseminars targeting government officials, elected representatives, and traditional leaders as well \n_______________________ \n8 ADB. 2002.

An  action plan, and widespread \ndissemination  and  discussion  of  the  findings  aim  to  facilitate  the  institutionalization  of  a \nparticipatory approach and the extension of activities to other regions, ministries, and PDMCs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The TA's purpose is to (i) improve civil society's capacity to engage more constructively \nand proactively in resource allocation prioritization and decision making and in monitoring \nservice delivery, and (ii) to encourage governments in the two pilot countries to become more \nresponsive to the participation of civil society in the resource allocation process. \n \n9.  The TA will build on work done to date and lessons learned, and coordinate with ongoing \ninitiatives by CSOs, governments, and development partners. The TA will have the following \noutputs: \n \n(i)   Within  4  months  of  TA  inception,  a  report  will  be  produced  containing  an \nassessment of regional good practices on participation in the resource allocation \nprocess by (a) identifying current practices, including traditional structures and \nprocesses; and (b) assessing them for strengths and weaknesses. The report will \ninclude recommendations on how to address the causes of these weaknesses as \nwell as the social relations, structures, and organizations that act to maintain \nthese weaknesses. \n(ii)  Based on the assessment, an action plan for TA capacity building activities and \ntraining material will be produced within 8 months of TA inception. Training \nmaterial will be developed for the various target audiences: CSOs, community \ngroups,  government  representatives  of  the  pilot  ministries  at  various \nadministrative levels, elected representatives, and traditional leaders. \n(iii)   CSOs, particularly women's and youth nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), \nwill be more proactive and constructive in participating in resource allocation \ndecisions and monitoring government service delivery. The number and quality of \nCSO submissions to ministries relating to resource allocation prioritization and \nservice delivery will be increased. \n(iv)   Government  officials  of  the  pilot  ministries,  elected  officials,  and  traditional \nleaders will (a) be more aware of the benefits of civil society participation in \nresource allocation decisions, (b) have a better understanding of participatory \nmethodologies,  and  (c)  be  encouraged  to  institutionalize  a  participatory \napproach. \n(v)   An action plan will be developed for scaling up activities to other ministries and \nparticipants within 22 months of TA inception. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will begin by assessing regional practices of involving civil society, traditional \ncommunity leaders, and structures in the decision making process for resource allocation at \ncommunity,  district,  provincial,  and  national  levels  and  linkages  between  levels.  The \nassessment will build on the findings of the CGAs, TA 6065, TA 5998,9 and TA 3360,10 and \ninitiatives of development partners, and make use of global good practices. Particular attention \n_______________________ \n9 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for Youth- and Gender-Sensitive Public Expenditure Management in the Pacific. \nManila (TA 5998).  \n10 ADB. 2000.

Manila (TA 3360). \n ", "4   \nwill be to the concerns of women and youth groups, often the most marginalized and largely \nexcluded from traditional and modern decision-making mechanisms.  \n \n11.  On the basis of the assessment, training material and an action plan outlining TA \nactivities will be developed. The training material will build on TA 6126 and adjust the material to \nthe country-specific and governance level (national, provincial, local) as well as to the targeted \nparticipants. The action plan will consider current government initiatives and complement ADB \nactivities to support governance of public sector institutions and processes.  \n \n12.  Capacity development workshops will be conducted for government officials at national, \nprovincial, district, community levels in selected pilot ministries, elected representatives, and \ntraditional leaders. The workshops aim to (i) demonstrate that civil society involvement can \nimprove the resource allocation process, (ii) provide guidance on participatory methodologies, \n(iii) provide for a forum for discussion with CSOs, and (iv) discuss institutionalization of a \nparticipatory approach to resource allocation. \n \n13.  Capacity  development  activities  targeting  civil  society  will  include  the  following:  (i) \ncapacity development workshops for CSOs using lessons learned and the material developed \nunder TA 6126; (ii)  capacity  development  through  workshops  and  learning-by-doing \ninitiatives for selected pilot communities in (a) establishing priorities, (b) determining resources \nrequired to address the issue, (c) assessing the decision making process and how to access \nand influence decision makers at various levels (community, district, provincial, national), (d) \nmonitoring and evaluating social service delivery, and (iii) assisting communities in preparing \nsubmissions to the government, for instance, for the annual budget, and selecting people to \nrepresent the community. Submissions will be made to the appropriate administrative level, and \ncapacity  building  activities  will  involve  government  staff  in  the  pilot  ministries  at  various \nadministrative levels.  Follow-up visits will be made to the communities after several months to \nreview progress and discuss obstacles encountered. Communities will be helped in following up \non other priority issues to institutionalize the approach and to strengthen the capacity to monitor \nservice delivery. \n \n14.  A scaling-up plan will be developed to (i) extend activities to other ministries, CSOs and \ncommunities, and other PDMCs; (ii) facilitate the institutionalization of a participatory approach; \n(iii) provide input to ADB's governance strategy; and (iv) evaluate activities including how to \nmonitor the poverty impact of the activities and the extent to which the youth, women, and the \npoor participated. \n \n15.  Innovative  ways  to  disseminate  lessons  learned  will  be  explored.11  Possibilities  of \ndisseminating experiences and training material via the Internet will also be explored.  \n \n16.  Several outreach seminars for government and elected officials, traditional leaders and \nCSOs, including media representatives will be conducted to provide a forum for discussing of \nextension of TA activities and institutionalization of a participatory approach. The outreach \nseminars will have representatives from other PDMCs as participants. \n \n_______________________ \n11 For instance, Femlink, an NGO based in Fiji, is currently piloting a community radio initiative to assist communities \nto  exchange  information,  experiences,  and  best  practices.  In  Vanuatu,  Wan  Smal  Bag  is  using  theatre \nperformances and video clips to deliver public health and governance education. ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent to be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. Detailed cost estimates and the financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. The TA funds will be administered by ADB. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Pacific Department of ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Foundation \nof the Peoples of the South Pacific International (FSPI) Regional Secretariat will be directly \nselected as lead consultant. FSPI is a regional NGO with representation and operations in both \nthe Fiji Islands and Vanuatu. During the Fact-Finding Mission, extensive discussions were held \nwith NGOs that could provide input to the TA activities. However, very few NGOs possess the \ncapacity to coordinate the input of other NGOs and community groups in both countries. FSPI is \ntherefore uniquely positioned for this task due to (i) its strong interest and extensive experience \nin institutional strengthening and capacity building in governance and poverty-related issues, (ii) \nits established network in various PDMCs and background in cooperating with local NGOs, and \n(iii) its strong record in implementing various ADB and other international development partners' \nprojects.12 FSPI will submit a simplified technical proposal. In its proposal FSPI will include local \nNGOs to carry out the work program.13 These NGOs are currently active in project-related \nactivities at national, provincial, and community levels. Their input will ensure that project \nactivities complement ongoing activities in each country and that they reach the widest range of \nbeneficiaries. The project team leader will be a full-time staff of FSPI, and will direct and \ncoordinate TA activities, and coordinate the input of community organizations and local CSOs in \nthe two countries. The project team leader will prepare quarterly progress reports and the final \nreport to ADB. Government ministries and departments will participate in TA activities. \n \n19.  FSPI will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging consultants. The total \nnumber of person-months is 65. FSPI will provide a total of 25 person-months, domestic NGOs \nwill provide another 40 person-months (18 person-months in Vanuatu and 22 person-months in \nthe Fiji Islands). Outline terms of reference and reporting requirements are in Appendix 3. The \nTA will start in September 2004 and is expected to be completed by December 2006. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for Making Resource Allocation Pro-\nPoor and Participatory in the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n_______________________ \n1 2
