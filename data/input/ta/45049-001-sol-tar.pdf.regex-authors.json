INTRODUCTION \n1.  A  key  aspect  of  effective  development  management  is  the  formulation  and \nimplementation  of  a  national  development  strategy.  For  Solomon  Islands,  this  is  doubly \nimportant, because development challenges are daunting, and priorities must be set. During \nthe  2011  country  programming  mission  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the \nGovernment  of  Solomon  Islands  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support \nimplementation of the national development strategy (NDS) for 2011\u20132020.1 The proposed TA \nis a continuation of the previous TA, which supported the formulation of the NDS.2 It directly \nlinks to ADB\u2019s country operations business plan 2012\u20132014 for Solomon Islands, is consistent \nwith the direction of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014 and Strategy 2020, and is coordinated \nwith related ADB regional TA projects, including Building Capacity for Statistics in the Pacific \nand Pacific Economic Management.3 The government concurs with the TA's objectives, scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since the country became independent in 1978, the well-being of the population has \nimproved modestly. With one of the fastest-growing populations in the world (2.8% per annum \nduring 2007\u20132009), Solomon Islands\u2019 per capita income is the second lowest in the region. A \nperiod of pronounced political instability and conflict\u2014\u2015the ethnic tensions\u2016 from 1999 to 2003\u2014\nfurther increased poverty, weakened governance, interrupted delivery of essential services, \nand exacerbated social tensions. However, the post-conflict economic recovery, for which the \nregional assistance mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) provided support, has witnessed \nimproved law and order and financial discipline. The government has undertaken a number of \nmajor reform initiatives, including those affecting telecommunications, state-owned enterprises, \nsecured  transactions,  and  public  financial  management,  and  has  launched  a  companies \nregistry. \n \n3.  Despite progress in recent years, the country continues to face a major challenge in \nproviding job opportunities and basic services to a rapidly growing population. Moreover, the \nSolomon Islands economy was strongly affected by the global economic crisis. Gross domestic \nproduct growth averaged 7.3% per annum in 2004\u20132008. In 2009, gross domestic product \ncontracted by 1.2%. Solomon Islands returned to positive growth of around 7.2% in 2010, with \nsimilar growth expected in 2011. While economic growth has rebounded quickly, medium-term \ngrowth prospects are uncertain. Logging resources, the country\u2019s main export, are expected to \nbe largely exhausted by the middle of the decade. The economy is also one of the most aid-\ndependent in the world. \n \n4.  The overarching theme of the NDS is to build better lives for all Solomon Islanders. Its \nmajor  areas  of  focus  are  (i)  poverty  alleviation  and  provision  of  greater  benefits  and \nopportunities; (ii) support for the vulnerable; (iii) providing access to quality health care and \n                                                \n1  Government of Solomon Islands. 2011.

The NDS also incorporates the principles of the Paris \nDeclaration for Aid Effectiveness.  \n \n5.  Development partners have provided assistance for strategy formulation for previous \ndevelopment  strategies  in  Solomon  Islands,  but  there  has  been  little  support  for  the \nimplementation of these plans and strategies. RAMSI support has been concentrated in the \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT). This, together with weak capacity within the Ministry \nof  Development  Planning  and  Aid  Coordination  (MDPAC),  has  resulted  in  incomplete \nimplementation and poor effectiveness of the plans. Previous experience in the Pacific has also \nshown  that  in  order  for  a  development  strategy  to  be  effective,  strong  links  need  to  be \nestablished  with  other  government  plans,  especially  annual  line-ministry  corporate  plans, \nprovincial plans, and the annual budget.  \n \n6.  The Provincial Government Support Programme has established provincial plans, within \nthe context of longer-term provincial strategic plans, as 3-year rolling plans. The guidelines for \nthe  ministerial  corporate  plans  require  core  3-year  rolling  plans  with  a  minimum  format \nencompassing policy context and financial requirements. At present, the corporate planning \nprocess has only minimal links with the NDS. Provincial and ministerial corporate plans are \nalso prepared on a government-wide, 3-year time horizon. Development budgets include 3-\nyear forward projections, which need to be strengthened. Sector plans have been prepared in \nkey areas including health, education and transport infrastructure (the National Transport Plan). \nThe linkage between the NDS, the budget, and the sector and provincial plans needs to be \nstrengthened.  \n \n7.  Typically, the government-funded portion of the development budget is about 20% of \ntotal development spending. In the existing budget process, implementing agencies receive \nshort notice of activities to be funded. As a result, on average, almost half of the government \ndevelopment budget goes unspent. \n \n8.  The government plans to address this situation by having the MOFT develop a 4-year \nrolling medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) to better inform the planning activities of \nministries and provinces in their 3-year rolling corporate and provincial plans. An MTEF is \ndesigned to link planning, which has a medium-term outlook, with the annual budget. As a \nconsequence, budgetary expenditures are linked more systematically with target outcomes \n(e.g., increased economic growth, increased employment, gender balance, slower population \ngrowth, higher literacy rates, lower infant mortality rates). The MTEF\u2019s principal focus is on \nincentivizing  the  government  to  allocate  budgetary  resources  to  programs,  activities,  and \nprojects that promote the country\u2019s strategic priorities. The preparation of an MTEF and its \nintegration with the NDS will require further development of technical and human resources \ncapability for forecasting and policy analysis. Further TA support is required to develop this \ncapability in Solomon Islands, particularly given the planned drawdown of resident RAMSI \nadvisors from 2012. \n \n9.  With ministerial corporate and provincial plans thus strengthened by the MTEF, the \npresent 3-year projections included in the annual development budget can be converted into a \n3-year rolling medium-term implementation plan. This would incorporate a 3-year development \nbudget, with details of development programs and projects, and an annual NDS performance \nevaluation report.  \n \n10.  The aid management and coordination unit in MDPAC is responsible for coordinating \n ", "  3 \nwith  the  government\u2019s  development  partners  to  fund  programs  and  update  the  annual \ndevelopment budget. The budget is not regularly updated, and when it is, it is completed on an \nad hoc basis. The updated annual development budget is then circulated to all ministries and \nline  agencies,  but  the  response  rate  has  been  disappointing.  Tracking,  monitoring,  and \nevaluating externally assisted projects are likewise done irregularly. A monitoring system needs \nto be developed to manage public investment information effectively, to promote accurate, \ntimely  information,  and  to  ensure  that  evaluation  of  policies  and  program  outcomes  is \ncommunicated back to the line agencies and ministries. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of \nprogress against the NDS will be instrumental to successful NDS implementation and will be \nreflected in the annual NDS performance evaluation report. \n \n11.  Implementation of the NDS will make considerable demands on  MDPAC staff and \nsector planners in relevant line ministries, including MOFT and the Bureau for Economic and \nSocial  Reform.  Specific  capacity  development  needs  will  include  strategic  development \nplanning,  sector  analysis,  and monitoring  and evaluation.  This  can  be  addressed through \ncapacity-building support for (i) mentoring and skills transfer through on-the-job training; (ii) \ndesigning and implementing short-term training, including training of trainers; and (iii) designing \na medium-term training program for skills retention. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be the achievement of sustainable pro-poor growth through effective \npolicy reform and strategy implementation. The outcome will be improved public expenditures \nand policies as a result of a strengthened development planning process.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will support the government in implementing a long-term strategic vision for \nachieving higher sustainable growth. The TA will help translate this vision into results-oriented \nobjectives and targets within a medium-term expenditure framework, annual budgets, 3-year \nrolling implementation plans, and ministerial corporate plans. The TA will also improve capacity \nin strategic development planning and macroeconomic and policy analysis to enhance planning \nprocesses with sound policy advice. The TA will entail the following key components: \n \n(i)  Development of an MTEF to link the annual budgets with the NDS. The MTEF \nwill also improve macroeconomic management by supporting a move toward \nmedium-term budgeting; \n \n(ii)  Formulation  of  rolling  3-year  implementation  plans  that  implement  and  track \nprogress against the NDS. These plans will draw on the corporate plans of all the \nministries and reflect government policies and priorities. Support will also be \nprovided  to  line  ministries  for  the  development  of  corporate  plans  that  are \nconsistent with the NDS;  \n \n(iii)  Strengthening  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  NDS  implementation  by  (a) \ndeveloping databases and templates to track progress against the indicators of \nthe NDS, and (b) producing an annual progress report on NDS implementation \nthat will feed into the 3-year rolling implementation plans; and \n \n ", "4   \n(iv)  Enhancement of the capacity of MDPAC staff and sector planners in relevant line \nministries, including MOFT and the Bureau for Economic and Social Reform with \nregard to strategic development planning, sector analysis, and monitoring and \nevaluation  by  (a)  providing  mentoring  and  skills  transfer  through  on-the-job \ntraining; (b) designing and implementing short-term training, including training of \ntrainers; and (c) designing a medium-term training program for skills retention. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The government has requested ADB to finance $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff salaries, office \naccommodation and transport, support services, and the facilitation of consultations. Details of \nthe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from January 2012 until January 2014. \nMOFT will be the executing agency and MDPAC will be the implementing agency. MDPAC will \nbe responsible for the focused reforms envisaged in the TA. The MOFT has administrative \nauthority within the government for all TA components. To facilitate communication between the \nimplementing and executing agencies, a project coordination committee will be established, \nchaired by the permanent secretary of MDPAC. Both MOFT and MDPAC will provide office \nspace for consultants and assign a senior counterpart staff member to lead the operational \naspects of the reform process. The public will participate through extensive consultations with \nkey  organizations  and  individuals  comprising  the  project\u2019s  stakeholder  group.  In  addition, \nseminars will be organized to discuss the implementation of the project.  \n \n16.  Consulting services of a total of 36 person-months (14 person-months international, 22 \nperson-months national) will be required for the implementation of the TA. The outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be selected in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The \nproceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). All \nequipment procured under the TA will be turned over to the implementing agency at the end of \nthe TA. \n \n17.  The Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office will administer the TA. Progress will be \nmonitored using the intended outcome and outputs described in the design and monitoring \nframework in Appendix 1. Good practices and lessons will be disseminated through training \nsessions and workshops, and through TA reports. \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Solomon  Islands  for  Supporting  the  Implementation  of  the  National \nDevelopment Strategy, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets   \n  and Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  Increase in average GDP  Asian Development Outlook  Assumptions \nSustainable pro-poor  growth (2011\u20132015)    TA design implemented quickly \ngrowth through effective  compared with the  Pacific Economic  Monitor  and effectively \npolicy reform and strategy  previous medium-term     \nimplementation  development strategy  Household  Income  and  Strong government commitment \n(2008\u20132010)  Expenditure Survey  to implement NDS \n     \nLower proportion of the  Pacific MDG Report  Risks \npopulation living below the    Crisis that will put strain on \npoverty line (2011\u20132015)  budget allocation and change \ncompared with the end of  focus \nthe previous medium-term   \ndevelopment strategy  Political instability \n(2008\u20132010)   \n   \nIncrease in proportion of \npupils reaching last grade \nof primary education \nOutcome  Underspend in  IMF Article IV reports  Assumptions \nImproved public  development budget    Strong and timely support from \nexpenditures and policies  reduced to 20% by 2013.
