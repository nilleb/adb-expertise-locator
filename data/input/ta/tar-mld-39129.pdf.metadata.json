In the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami disaster, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with \nthe United Nations (UN) and World Bank, undertook a tsunami damage and needs assessment \nin the Maldives, which was immediately followed by the formulation of an assistance program in \nsupport of the country\u2019s recovery efforts. An ADB fact-finding mission from 31 January to 11 \nFebruary  2005  drew  up  ADB\u2019s  assistance  program  for  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction.  The  present  technical  assistance  (TA),1  for  promoting  sound  environmental \nmanagement in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster, complements that earlier program and is \npart of ADB\u2019s efforts to support the Government of the Maldives in reconstruction. The Mission \nreached an understanding with the Government on the goals, purpose, scope, implementation, \ncost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA.2 \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Maldives is a chain of 1,190 small low-lying coral islands grouped into 26 atolls in \nthe Indian Ocean: 198 islands are inhabited and 80 of these house tourist resorts. The islands \nare mainly coastal entities, and their ecosystems are among the world\u2019s most vulnerable. The \neconomic base is a narrow one; it relies on two critical sectors\u2014tourism and fisheries. As most \natoll workers are employed in these sectors, protecting the fragile coral reefs and coasts, \nfisheries, and the marine environment from pollution is central to any poverty strategy. The \ncountry\u2019s  unique  geography  and  vulnerability  pose  key  development  challenges.  With  the \npopulation dispersed across the archipelago, economies of scale are difficult to achieve and \nsocial service delivery is therefore costly. Living conditions are deteriorating on many inhabited \nislands where the freshwater lens is at risk because of groundwater pollution and high salinity, \nas well as increasing pollution of lagoons.  \n \n3.   The  effects  of  poor  infrastructure  and  social  services  in  the  atolls  were  further \nheightened  by  the  damage  from  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami  that  hit  the  Maldives  on  26 \nDecember 2004 and ravaged infrastructure. The high waves and floods engulfed waste disposal \nsites and strewed previously collected waste throughout the islands, endangering public health \nand putting the groundwater lens at risk of contamination from leachate. The freshwater lens is \nalso in danger of contamination from spilled oil, salt intrusion, and sewage from fractured \nsewerage networks or damaged septic tanks. The natural disaster has led to a number of \nenvironmental and public-health concerns: while water supply and basic sanitation services are \nin urgent need of reconstruction or development, expediting adequate solid waste management \npractices and structuring of the sector for efficient operation is critical at this stage. \n \n4.  A large number of projects in several sectors (water supply and sanitation, health, \nhousing, transport and power, among others) have been formulated amid generous support \nfrom the international community. Institutional resources, however, are limited, and to most \nministries, projects become more and more difficult to implement as their number increases. \nThe Ministry of Health and the Maldives Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (MWSA) are \nintroducing more than 30 water supply (through desalination) and sanitation schemes; but there \nis as yet no common strategy defining the steps and actions to be taken. The Ministry of \n                                                 \n1  This TA was formulated to complement the Tsunami Emergency Assistance Project to the Maldives (ADB. 2005. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Grant and Loan to the \nRepublic of the Maldives for the Tsunami Emergency Assistance Project. Manila), after the completion of the 2004 \nCountry Strategy Program Update for the Maldives. It was cleared in concept by the Vice-President (Operations 1) \non 14 March 2005. \n2  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 18 March 2003.   \n ", "2   \nEnvironment and Construction (MEC) is also facing severe difficulties in dealing with all the \nissues associated with reconstruction and ensuring that adequate environmental measures are \nundertaken; attending to so many projects would require a large increase in staff capacity.  \n \n5.  For the projects to succeed, the communities must participate actively throughout the \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  process.  To  make  them  more  capable  of  assuming  new \nresponsibilities, the communities must be organized and their awareness raised. In the past, \ncapacity-building activities in the Maldives concentrated mostly on hygiene education3 rather \nthan on an inclusive environmental health and management program taking into account local \nlivelihoods  and  practices  within  the  overall  cultural  context.  Such  an  inclusive  program  is \nneeded to develop widespread understanding of the interdependence and fragility of ecological \nsystems  and  the  natural  resource  base  on  which  people  depend  for  their  well-being. \nEnvironmental education could give rise to the adoption of new behaviors in protecting the water \nand natural resources that are essential to human development on the islands. Education and \nincreased knowledge would also equip the communities to cope better and be more self-reliant \nin the face of new disasters, thus providing mechanisms to reduce their vulnerability. \n \n6.   The strong community fabric on the islands has become more evident in the aftermath of \nthe tsunami disaster, as communities confront island reconstruction in a way that is consistent \nwith their self-identified needs and development plans. For a number of years, the Government \nhas  promoted  community  participation  in  the  delivery  of  public  services  to  empower  atoll \ncommunities, thus increasing accountability and ownership. Community groups often provide \npublic or collective services on distant islands. However, capacity difficulties are generally \nencountered at the start. Organization and management assistance through cooperatives could \nhelp them overcome these difficulties.  \n \n7.   Moreover, other projects implemented after natural disasters have brought out the need \n(i)  to  integrate  recovery  and  long-term  development  planning,  (ii)  to  identify  development \noutputs that are sustainable, and (iii) to link infrastructure development with capacity building \nand institutional development. Thus, there is an emerging need to develop the community\u2019s \ncapacity  to  participate  in  design  and  implementation,  and  to  manage  environmental \ninfrastructure and services,4 thus speeding up the recovery of the affected islands. \n \n8.  In support of the country\u2019s recovery efforts, ADB formulated the Tsunami Emergency \nAssistance Project (TEAP) which included assistance to the water supply and sanitation and \nsolid waste management sectors. The TEAP, however, concentrated exclusively on providing \nand rehabilitating infrastructure; a complementary sound environmental management program \nwas deemed critical to the long-term sustainability of outputs. In a first stage, the TA will support \ninfrastructure development activities under the TEAP. Activities piloted and pioneered under this \nassistance  may  be  replicated  under  the  Regional  Development  Project,  Phase  II  \u2013 \nEnvironmental  Infrastructure  and  Management,  which  will  make  further  use  of  community \norganization and training and education materials. The TA should provide the Government with \nthe  operating  framework  needed  to  replicate  such  activities  and  devolve  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  activities  to  island  communities.  The  TA  will  also  (i)  promote  good \ngovernance by devolving responsibilities to the island communities, (ii) reduce poverty through \nregional human development, and (iii) provide opportunities for cooperative and private sector \ndevelopment, as highlighted in the Country Strategy Program for 2004\u20132006 and its updates. \n                                                 \n3  This refers to the Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) program, which was jointly \ndeveloped by MWSA and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). \n4  The United Nations Environment Programme is developing a strategy for solid waste management. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The goal of the TA is to improve environmental sustainability in the Maldives, helping \nachieve the desired Millennium Development Goals (MDG) targets. More immediately, it will \ndevelop  and  test  on  tsunami-affected  islands  an  environmental  management  program  that \nfocuses  predominantly  but  not  solely  on  environmental  health  and  awareness.  Efforts  to \nreaddress the extensive achievements made before the tsunami will be supported in every \npossible way. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  achieve  the  stated  goal  and  outcome  by  (i)  formulating  a  strategy  for \nrehabilitating  and  reconstructing  the  water  and  sanitation  sector;  (ii)  building  capacity  for \nenvironmental assessment; (iii) testing and promoting innovative environmental education and \npublic  awareness  programs  in  environmental  health  and  environmental  management;  and \n(iv) promoting community mobilization and organization for community-based management and \nO&M of sanitation and solid waste management systems.  \n \n11.  Formulating  a  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Strategy  for  the  Water  and \nSanitation Sector. The TA will give institutional support to MWSA in establishing a framework \nwithin which the water and sanitation sector can operate throughout the reconstruction process. \nActivities will comprise (i) developing an information base on the drinking water supply and \nsanitation  sector,  before  and  after  the  tsunami;  (ii)  making  a  comprehensive  analysis  of \npractices, activities, and stakeholders in the sector, and its institutional regulatory setup; (iii) \ndeveloping a methodology for participatory planning in the sector; (iv) developing strategic \noptions for nationwide application (including criteria and planning principles for selecting and \ndesigning water and sanitation schemes); (v) preparing an institutional framework that defines \nthe responsibilities of all stakeholders in the sector; and (vi) formulating a water supply and \nsanitation (WSS) strategy for tsunami-affected islands based, among others, on needs identified \nby the communities themselves. \n \n12.  Building  Capacity  for  Environmental  Assessment.  MEC  is  mandated  to  provide \nguidance  and  to  review  and  assess  all  environmental  documents  associated  with  the \nimplementation of development activities. The TA will assist MEC by (i) reviewing the legal and \ninstitutional framework and practices used in environmental assessments and recommending \nimprovements in quality and effectiveness, (ii) developing training materials for environmental \nassessment reflecting issues encountered in tsunami-related reconstruction as well as typical \ndevelopment activities in the Maldives, and (iii) conducting training in the formulation and review \nof environmental impact assessments. \n \n13.  Testing  and  Promoting  Innovative  Environmental  Education  and  Public \nAwareness. To succeed, the Government\u2019s reconstruction and rehabilitation strategy must be \nclosely  associated  with  a  specially  designed  environmental  awareness  program  that  will \nincrease understanding at the central level, and especially in the island communities. For this \npurpose the technical assistance will (i) carry out a rapid perceptions assessment in selected \ncommunities;  (ii)  select  and  develop  adequate  methodologies  and  tools  for  promoting \nenvironmental  education  and  awareness;  (iii)  develop  materials  for  an  environmental \nawareness, education, and outreach program; (iv) test the education awareness program by \nconducting training in communities on the three to five islands expected to be selected for \n ", "4   \nsupport under the TEAP; (v) prepare outline guidelines for teachers or community trainers and \nconduct a train-the-trainers program; and (vi) develop indicators for evaluating the program after \n6 months. Methods for raising awareness will make use of local and indigenous knowledge, \nallowing  the  learners  to  draw  scientific  principles  and  social  insights  from  their  immediate \nenvironment and increasing the connection between school and community, exogenous and \nendogenous knowledge. \n \n14.  Although the environmental education program is expected to have a strong focus on \nenvironmental  health  and  hygiene,  the  component  must  be  integrated  with  long-term \nsustainable environmental management, natural resource conservation practices, and elements \nof education for disaster risk reduction. Thus, proposed modules will include topics such as \n(i) rain and island groundwater resources; (ii) vegetation and groundwater; (iii) salinity, water \nresources management, and appropriate groundwater extraction systems; (iv) point pollution \nsources;  (v)  community  solid  waste  management  (including  collection,  segregation,  and \ncomposting); (vi) lagoon and reef pollution and conservation; (vii) coastal zone management \nand beach erosion; (viii) community-driven natural resource management; and (ix) disaster \nawareness, preparedness, and management. \n \n15.  Organizing for Community-Based Environmental Management. The TA will review \napproaches to community organization for environmental management5 in the Maldives and \nrefine a preferred approach, which includes initial environmental management activities for \ncommunity  organizations.6  Specifically,  the  TA  will  (i)  develop  a  procedural  framework  for \ncommunity participation in community-based management; (ii) identify key stakeholders and \nassess issues in consultation with island development committees and women\u2019s development \ncommittees; (iii) conduct preliminary technical and organizational workshops in all aspects of \nWSS and SWM, to develop a good understanding and reach agreement on outstanding issues; \n(iv) identify community \u201cmobilizers\u201d on the three to five islands selected for the TEAP; (v) \ndevelop  community  organization  and  mobilization  guidelines;  and  (vi) transfer  community \ndevelopment skills to selected island \u201dmobilizers\u201d and the TEAP PMU in preparation for the \ntransfer of the sanitation and solid waste management schemes. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The  technical  assistance  will  cost  an  estimated  $500,000  equivalent,  comprising \n$279,000 in foreign exchange costs and $221,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will \nfinance $400,000 equivalent, which will cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $121,000 \nequivalent of the local currency costs. The remaining $100,000 equivalent will be contributed by \nthe Government and will cover office accommodation, transportation, salaries of counterpart \nstaff, background reports and studies, and workshop facilitation. The technical assistance will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector and administered by \nADB. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) will be the Executing Agency and the \nNational Economic Recovery and Reconstruction Programme Office (NERRPO) will be the \nImplementing Agency. NERRPO will appoint a TA focal point with a supportive, coordinating, \n                                                 \n5  The TA will preferentially focus on developing the capacity of traditional community organizations in the islands \nsuch as the Women\u2019s Development Committees, which provide basic solid waste collection services, and the \nmosque-based programs for community water collection. \n6  Activities will include community participation in water testing, utilities, and solid waste management O&M. \n ", "  5\nand  facilitating  role.  Overall  guidance  will  be  provided  by  the  TEAP\u2019s  project  coordinating \ncommittee, co-chaired by the Minister of Finance and Treasury and the Minister of Planning and \nNational Development (MPND) or their designated representatives and with representatives \nfrom MWSA, MEC, the Ministry of Atolls Development, and MPND as members. \n \n18.  The consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB under the direct selection method \nin accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and \nIts Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The direct selection method will be applied based on (i) the emergency nature of \nthe work required and (ii) the experts\u2019 distinctive qualifications for implementing this assignment. \nLive  and  Learn  Environmental  Education  will  be  engaged  directly  by  ADB  to  deliver  the \nnecessary  outputs.  Live  and  Learn  Environmental  Education  is  the  most  qualified  and \ncompetent implementing organization to provide the services required based on its experience, \ncapacity, and commitment.7 Direct engagement The TA will be implemented over 10 months, \nserved  intermittently,  commencing  in  August  2005  and  ending  in  May  2006.  The  team  of \ninternational and domestic experts will provide about 30 person-months of consulting services\u2014\n14 person-months\u2019 international and 16 person-months\u2019 domestic. The international experts will \ninclude  experts  in  environmental  assessment,  environmental  education,  community \nparticipation, SWM, and WSS. The domestic consultants will include experts in community \nparticipation and social development, environmental awareness, and educational media. The \nmethodology and terms of reference for the TA are specific and clearly defined (see Appendix \n3). Hence, the contract with Live and Learn Environmental Education will be negotiated on the \nbasis of ADB\u2019s procedures for simplified technical proposals.  \n \n19.  Live and Learn Environmental Education will produce four major reports: (i) an inception \nreport no later than 6 weeks after the start of the services; (ii) a midterm report by the end of the \nfifth month; (iii) a draft final report by the end of the ninth month; and (iv) a final report 3 weeks \nafter the receipt of comments from the Government and ADB on the draft final report. Each \nmonth the consultants will submit short progress notes summarizing project activities, issues, \nand constraints. The consultants will translate the key deliverables of this TA into Dhivehi to \nfacilitate review by the Government and other stakeholders. Once approved, the WSS strategy \nwill be disseminated through official publication channels and through the print and electronic \nmedia. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof the Maldives to be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector \nfor Promoting Sound Environmental Management in the Aftermath of the Tsunami Disaster, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n7  Live and Learn Environmental Education has a good record in implementing community environmental education \nprojects, including the ADB-supported pilot demonstration activities under RETA-6123 (ADB.
