INTRODUCTION\n1. The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) for Policy Research and Capacity\nBuilding to Strengthen Rural Economies in the Southwest Region of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) will support the preparation of a comprehensive study recommending the policies \nneeded to build a firm foundation of labor income opportunities to protect and improve the lives \nof the rural low-income population in the southwest region of the PRC.1 Paying particular attention \nto Guizhou province, the TA will support the preparation of policy recommendations to strengthen \nboth the agriculture and non-agriculture sectors that have the most impact in ensuring labor \nincome opportunities for the rural low-income population. The TA will help improve the lives of the \nlow-income population and include them in the development process by strengthening economic \nactivities in the southwestern region of the PRC. \n2. The TA is consistent with the overarching goal of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\ncountry partnership strategy, 2021\u20132025 for the PRC, which supports the Government of the\nPRC\u2019s efforts to achieve high-quality, green development and notes that gains from rapid growth\nhave not been shared evenly in the PRC and that \"tackling inequality of income and opportunity\nrequires policy actions to reduce environmental, social, and economic disparities between regions,\nand between rural and urban areas.\"2\nII. ISSUES\n3. While the PRC has made tremendous progress in reducing poverty\u2014approximately 850\nmillion people have risen out of absolute poverty in the last four decades\u2014rapid growth has also\ngiven rise to new concerns, including social inequality. The country announced in February 2021\nthat it had eradicated absolute poverty.3 However, gains from rapid growth have not been shared\nevenly, with the PRC\u2019s Gini coefficient remaining at a relatively high level\u2014above 0.46\u2014from\n2014\u20132019.4 The Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of\nChina  prioritized  high-quality  development  by  establishing  support  mechanisms  for\nunderdeveloped areas, promoting the sustainable development of industries with local features,\nand helping key rural counties emerge from poverty.\n4. Guizhou is one of the lower income provinces in the PRC. In 2019, its gross domestic\nproduct per capita was CNY46,433, or 65.8% of the PRC average (CNY70,581).5 In 2017, its\npoverty rate of 7.75% was more than double the national rate of 3.10%.6 In support of the national\ngovernment\u2019s innovative approach of inclusive development and focus on rural revitalization, the\nGuizhou provincial government identified and started developing key rural industries that have \nstrong potential to create local labor income opportunities, such as ecological poultry, farming, \ntea, edible fungus cultivation, Chinese medicinal herb cultivation, and tourism. The Guizhou \nprovincial government also identified \u201cEight Elements\u201d for the promotion of a rural industrial\nrevolution: selection of industries, training of farmers, provision of technical services, fund raising, \n1  The technical assistance will look at selected areas in the southwest region of the PRC, which comprises Chongqing \nmunicipality, Guizhou province, Sichuan province, Yunnan Autonomous Region, and Tibet Autonomous Region. \n2  ADB. 2021.

Despite these efforts, further development is needed, particularly in rural areas where\nresource  utilization  is  limited.  Strengthening  rural  economies  to  ensure  local  labor  income\nopportunities for the rural low-income population in the southwest PRC, including in the Guizhou\nprovince, is a key concern. Policies are needed to build a firm foundation of local labor income\nopportunities to protect and improve the lives of the rural low-income population. There is also a\nneed to understand how the changing national and global contexts affect the local economy. This\nhas become even more important following the PRC\u2019s achievement of its goal of absolute poverty \neradication in 2020, which saw low-income households starting to seek more stable and higher \nlabor income streams. Investigating the various factors of production in urban and rural areas, \nstrengthening farm and nonfarm income streams, reducing labor income gaps within the region, \nand promoting a coordinated and new regional development approach to provide sustainable \nlabor income opportunities are needed. It is also important to identify obstacles and potential \ngrowth paths for local rural labor income opportunities in this region. \n6. The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and will contribute to addressing vulnerable\npopulations and reducing inequalities within the PRC, promoting rural development and food \nsecurity, and strengthening governance and institutional capacity.8 The TA also follows the \nrecommendations from the final review of the country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the\nPRC, which recognized that \u201cimplementing loan projects at lower levels of government helps \naddress local institutional and capacity gaps, which are often the main constraints on achieving \nnational development goals.\u201d9\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Impact and Outcome\n7. The TA is aligned with the following impact: green, high-quality development achieved,\nespecially across counties in the southwest region of the PRC.10 The TA will have the following\noutcome: strategies and policies to strengthen agriculture and nonagriculture sectors in the\nsouthwest region improved.11 The TA will support a study that is expected to better inform the\nGuizhou  provincial  government  on  policies  that  improve  production  conditions,  strengthen\ncapacity development, and enhance labor income opportunities. By the end of the TA, at least\none policy recommendation or innovation measure arising from the TA is expected to be adopted\nand implemented by multiple stakeholders in Guizhou. The study is also expected to lead to at\nleast  one  stakeholder  in  the  southwest  region,  from  either  the  agriculture  sector  or  a\nnonagriculture sector, to adopt an innovative measure to promote sustainability of its operation\nand create labor income opportunities for the rural low-income population.\n7  In July 2019, the Guizhou provincial government issued Opinions on Deepening the Rural Industrial Revolution to \nStrive for the Overall Success in the Fight against Poverty, proposing \u201cEight Elements\u201d for the development of rural \nindustries. \n8  ADB. 2018.

Output  1:  Study  on  strengthening  rural  economies  that  ensures labor income\nopportunities of the rural low-income population in the southwest People's Republic of\nChina completed. The TA will first conduct a stock-taking exercise of the targeted sectors,  such\nas ecological poultry, farming, tea, edible fungus cultivation, Chinese medicinal herb cultivation,\nand  tourism,  through  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  existing  policy  research  and\nrecommendations relevant to the region and assess the progress and challenges in implementing\nthese. Based on this exercise, the TA will produce a comprehensive study analyzing (i) the\nchallenges surrounding existing economic foundations, including labor market and land policies,\ninvestments in physical infrastructure, employment services, the role of financial institutions, and\nlinks with vocational education and income transfers; (ii) the conditions to support efficient flows\nof production factors between urban and rural areas, including tax incentives and pilot investment\nopportunities; (iii) the approaches to building sustainable green economies through institutional\nand policy reforms; and (iv) the policy recommendations and steps to providing labor income\nopportunities  to  rural  low-income  households.  A  section  on  gender-specific  issues  in  the\nsouthwest  region  of  the  PRC  will  also  be  included.  This  could  cover  female  labor  force\nparticipation in the agriculture sector, levels of skills of the female labor force in the sector, and\nbarriers and opportunities for reskilling and capacity building of women in the agriculture sector.\nThe study will also include at least one case study of a city in Guizhou province, such as Bijie,\nLiupanshui, and Tongren\u2014which could serve as a demonstration case that can be replicated in\nother cities in the PRC, particularly in the southwest region, and in other ADB developing member \ncountries. \n9. The study will align with recommendations from past ADB TA projects and projects in\nGuizhou province, including the study supported by the TA on Provincial Development Strategies\nfor Chongqing Municipality and Guizhou Province, which reviewed economic development and\nthe  industrialization  strategy  in  Guizhou;12 and  the  results-based  lending  for  the  Guizhou\nVocational  Education  Development  Program,  which  looked  at  strengthening  technical  and\nvocational education and training in the province.13 The study also builds on previous studies\nsupported by ADB\u2019s regional TA for Supporting Strategic Knowledge Products and Research\nNetworking,14 such as the Poverty Reduction and Development: National Strategies and a Case \nStudy of ADB-Funded Pilot Project in Nayong County in Guizhou Province, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, which shows how national poverty reduction strategies and local projects contribute \nsuccessfully to poverty reduction and development.15  \n10. While the primary means of dissemination of the study and policy recommendations is\nthrough digital publication and workshops, the TA will support printing of publication, if a Chinese\nversion of the study is needed for distribution to local government officials and local enterprise\nowners to better disseminate the results of the study.\n11.

The TA will distill actionable policy recommendations from the \nstudies completed under output 1, and provide specific policy advice on strengthening the rural \neconomies through the channels identified in the studies. Policy notes will be produced and \npolicies recommended to support rural economies in the region. These works will be disseminated \nat training workshops for consideration of the Guizhou provincial government and other local \ngovernment units in the southwest region of the PRC.  \n12. Output 3: Understanding of local government officials and managers of business\nenterprises on the approaches to strengthen local economies enhanced. The TA will support\ntechnical workshops and dialogue with the provincial government and managers of business\nenterprises to help strengthen the understanding of environmentally sustainable, value-adding\npractices in managing rural enterprises. At least 30 government and industry officials, at least 30%\nof which are female, are expected to attend these workshops and training. Evaluation and\nfeedback forms will be used after the workshops and training. Follow-up surveys and dialogue\nwith enterprise managers will be held to assess if there was increased understanding of issues\naffecting operations in the targeted rural areas. At least one stakeholder\u2014a village leader, an\nenterprise, a collective agriculture unit, or a local government unit\u2014is expected to adopt at least\none of the innovative approaches or policy recommendations identified by the study, which will\nlead to sustainable operations. The TA assumes that enterprises, farmers, and local government\nofficials are open to adopting innovative approaches, and there will be no changes in national or\nlocal government priorities which could hinder the achievement of this indicator during the TA\nimplementation period. A follow-up survey will also be undertaken with participants of workshops\nand trainings 6 months and 1 year after the study, workshops, and training sessions to gauge the\nlevel of adoption of study recommendations. The adoption of policy recommendations is expected\nto  help  strengthen  enterprises  and  enable  them  to  better  contribute  to  green,  high-quality\ndevelopment.\nC. Cost and Financing\n13. The TA is estimated to cost $330,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis\nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).16\n14. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of information and data\nsupport, counterpart staff, office supplies, conference and training venues, secretarial assistance,\nand other in-kind contributions.
