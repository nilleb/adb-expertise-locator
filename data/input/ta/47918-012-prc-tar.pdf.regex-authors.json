The  proposed  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  facilitate \nimplementation  of the Energy  Efficiency  Multi-Project  Financing  Program supported  by  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).1 The  program \ninvolves the issuance by ADB of up to CNY800 million in partial credit guarantees in favor of \nselected  financial  institutions  (partner  banks)  to  develop  energy  efficiency  financing.  The \nprogram remains highly relevant with the government\u2019s priority of achieving energy efficiency in \nbuildings, which has a long-lasting and large cumulative impact in mitigating climate change. \nThe program is expected to enable a large number of energy end users to improve efficiency by \nbenefiting from access to finance. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  More than half of the PRC\u2019s population, about 700 million people, now lives in urban \nareas, and the figure is expected to rise sharply over the next decade, leading to a huge \ndemand  for  new  and  retrofitted  buildings  to  accommodate  expanding  urban  communities. \nBuildings currently account for nearly one-third of the country\u2019s total energy consumption. In \naddition to the massive level of construction that has taken place, another 10\u201315 billion square \nmeters of residential buildings and 10 billion square meters of public buildings will be added in \nurban areas between 2010 and 2020. Improving energy efficiency in buildings with appropriate \ntechnologies locks in the pattern of energy use for many years. Retrofitting existing buildings \nand new buildings with proven technologies can lead to energy savings of 20%\u201340%.  \n \n3.  The Government of the PRC has increasingly acknowledged the importance of green \nbuildings to achieve its stated goal of reducing energy intensity. In January 2013, the State \nCouncil issued the Green Building Action Plan as No. 1 Document, which for the first time \nfocused on urban issues. Targets have been set to develop 1 billion square meters of new \ngreen building floor area by 2015, a 14 times increase on the existing 69.5 million square \nmeters in 2012.2  \n \n4.  Energy efficiency projects can often pay for themselves from energy cost savings, with a \nrelatively short payback period (3\u20135 years), but access to financing has been a major bottleneck. \nThe main reasons why financially viable energy efficiency projects fail to attract commercial \nbank loans in the PRC are summarized as follows: \n(i)  The  local  banking  sector  is  highly  liquid,  but  financing  is  often  based  on \ncollateralization of up to 200% of the loan amount, making it difficult for energy \nend users to raise financing. Substantial credit enhancement is needed to meet \nthe security requirements of local commercial banks. \n(ii)  Energy efficiency projects involve a wide range of technologies with which the \ncommercial  banks  are  often  unfamiliar.  There  is  a  gap  in  energy  efficiency \nknowledge and misperceptions of actual technology risks. Commercial banks \nhave  not  yet  developed  sufficient  technical  knowledge  and  experience.  No \nspecific training system exists. As a result, there is little marketing, evaluation, \nand structuring of energy efficiency projects. \n \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n2 Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development, and Ministry of Finance. 2012. The Implementation Options on \nAccelerating the Development of New Buildings. Beijing. \n ", "2 \n \n(iii)  Management  awareness  about  energy  efficiency  financing  is  low,  and  no \neffective financing model for energy efficiency projects has been developed in \nthe market. Few management resources have therefore been allocated for this \npurpose. \n(iv)  The  due  diligence  costs  associated  with  energy  efficiency  projects  are  high \nbecause of the need for technical evaluation, regardless of the project size.  \n(v)  Availability of medium- and long-term loans, even for 3\u20135 years, is very limited. \n \n5.  The Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPDB) was selected as the first domestic \nbank  under  the  program  with  a  guarantee  limit  of  CNY300  million,  based  on  its  strong \nmanagement  commitment,  dedicated  team,  and  prudent  credit  evaluation  and  monitoring \nsystem. SPDB has made good progress on the program\u2019s implementation: a special credit \nevaluation channel, marketing channel, and various new procedures have been developed. \nSince  its  first  loan  in  February  2013,  more  than  10  projects  have  been  reviewed.  SPDB \nmanagement has also arranged various internal training workshops where ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations Department and Regional and Sustainable Development Department contributed as \nspeakers.  \n \n6.  The program has benefited from the technical skills of the technical partner, Johnson \nControls, a global leader in delivering integrated energy efficiency solutions, throughout the \nwhole project cycle. Johnson Controls will assist partner banks in identifying potential energy-\nsaving projects, carrying out technical due diligence, and monitoring actual energy savings. \n \n7.  The primary lesson learned from operating the  program and from other multilateral \ninstitutions that have been implementing similar energy efficiency programs is that  partner \nbanks need flexibility in credit criteria, and specialized credit training to assess and process the \nhighly divergent and technical nature of energy efficiency projects. Through systematic training, \nthe TA will help enhance energy efficiency capabilities and create better awareness among \ncommercial banks.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to facilitate a new financing mechanism for efficiently fostering \ndemand-side energy management. More specifically, the TA will support SPDB and potential \nnew  partner  banks  to  improve  the structuring,  credit  evaluation,  and monitoring  of  energy \nefficiency loans on the basis of the economic merits and cash flows of energy savings.3 Several \nworkshops will be arranged under the TA to share knowledge and promote energy efficiency \nactivities among stakeholders such as financial institutions, government agencies, energy end \nusers, and providers. \n \n                                                \n3 Partner banks will be selected at the sole discretion of ADB. Each partner bank will be subject to detailed due \ndiligence and credit analysis. The standardized credit review of each partner bank will include an analysis of capital \nadequacy, asset quality, liquidity, connected or large lending, and profitability. It will also include a review of \nownership, integrity, governance, anti-money-laundering measures, credit approval process, and operating capacity. \nThe final selection of partner banks will be subject to the approval of an investment committee.  \n \n ", "    3 \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA\u2019s impacts will be (i) more private sector investment in energy efficiency projects \nin the PRC, and (ii) energy savings and associated reduction in the growth of greenhouse gases \nand other pollutants. \n \n10.  The outcome will be the increased financing of energy efficiency projects by SPDB and \nother partner banks brought about by greater awareness of energy efficiency issues among \nstakeholders. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA  output  is  increased  capacity  of  partner  banks  in  energy-efficiency-related \nfinancial  products  and  services.  The  output  will  be  delivered  through  training  sessions  to \ndevelop energy efficiency finance, and through workshops that disseminate lessons learned by \nthe partner banks. The banks\u2019 internal manual for credit analysis and loan processing of various \nenergy efficiency projects will be developed or updated. \n \n12.  The TA is classified as capacity development TA category B. It will include (i) training in \nenergy  efficiency  finance  for  bank  headquarters  covering  introduction  to  energy-saving \ntechnologies in buildings, economics of energy-saving equipment, sector analysis, international \nbest practice in structuring energy efficiency loans, assessing energy efficiency cash flows, \nmarketing energy efficiency financial services, among others; (ii) training in credit underwriting, \nrisk assessment, and portfolio management and reporting practices; (iii) fine-tuning of a special \nunit within partner banks for this program and development; and (iv) designing an incentive \nmechanism for end borrowers.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nClean Energy Fund4 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and administered \nby ADB. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented over a 24-month period commencing in October 2013 and \ncompleting in October 2015. ADB will administer the TA to deliver the training. ADB and partner \nbanks will form a TA task force to communicate regularly to assess needs, monitor progress, \nand discuss issues. The partner banks will ensure full cooperation and coordination with ADB \nand the consultants to ensure that the training is delivered and the TA outcome is achieved. To \nthis end, the partner banks will designate a fully mandated team of selected staff responsible for \ninternal arrangements to ensure that relevant staff attend and assimilate the training, and that \nnecessary internal rules and procedures are established to support the TA outcome. Johnson \nControls will also contribute to the TA on aspects of energy efficiency technologies. \n \n15.  The TA will require an estimated 10 person-months of international consulting services \nand 10 person-months of national consulting services. The consultants must have at least \n8 years of experience in energy efficiency financing, energy efficiency project development, and \n                                                \n4 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n ", "4 \n \nrelevant training experiences. The assignment will be on an intermittent basis over a 24-month \nperiod. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  Consulting services will be provided through a firm recruited using quality- and cost-\nbased selection at a ratio of 80:20 and a simplified technical proposal. The consulting firm will \nbe  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended from time to time).

Introduction \n \n1.  Energy efficiency investments are needed in a range of market segments, and each \nsector has distinct credit characteristics and investment needs. Since the commercial banks \nhave  limited  experience  in  energy  efficiency  financing,  the  Energy  Efficiency  Multi-Project \nFinancing  Program  will focus  on  a  specific  area  to  accelerate  learning  among the  banks. \nConsultations have led to the selection of energy efficiency in buildings as the initial target \nmarket on the basis of market potential, as well as on the commercial banks\u2019 interest, appetite, \nand capacity. Energy efficiency in buildings can be achieved with proven technologies and has \nsignificant improvement potential. Given the rapid urbanization of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), energy efficiency in buildings will have a long-lasting and large cumulative impact. \nThe  partner  banks  do  not  typically  have  internal  resources  to  evaluate  energy  efficiency \nprojects. \n \n2.  Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPDB) was selected as the first domestic partner \nbank under the program. Other potential partner banks will be selected by ADB. \n \n3.  Implementation  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  include  10  person-months  of \ninternational consulting and 10 person-months of national consulting services. International and \nnational consultants will help the banks increase finance for sustainable energy and energy \nefficiency  projects,  and  assist  the  banks  in  identifying  opportunities  for  energy  efficiency \nfinancing in the building sector. The consulting team will provide training for staff to improve \ntheir  skills  in  evaluating  proposals  on  energy  efficiency  financing,  as  well  as  on  product \ndevelopment and marketing. The consultant is also expected to assist in arranging workshops \nfor stakeholders such as other financial institutions, government agencies, energy efficiency end \nusers, and providers, to share the lessons learned by partner banks and to improve awareness \non building energy efficiency. \n \nB.  Scope of Work \n \n4.  The activities of the TA will take place over a 2-year period. The implementation team \nwill include three international experts: (i) team leader and energy efficiency training expert \n(2 person-months), (ii) building energy efficiency and energy management expert (4 person-\nmonths),  and  (iii)  energy  efficiency  financing  expert  (4  person-months).  The  international \nexperts shall work with two national experts: (i) energy efficiency financing expert (5 person-\nmonths) and (ii) building energy efficiency expert (5 person-months) to deliver the following \ntasks: \n(i)  Prepare a capacity development program for partner banks\u2019 senior management \nand operational staff by working with ADB experts and Johnson Controls (if \nnecessary) to develop detailed training materials and courses in both English and \nChinese, which shall include the following: \n(a)  energy efficiency policies and other relevant regulations in the PRC; \n(b)  international best practices of energy efficiency and their application to \nurban residential, commercial, and industrial buildings and facilities in the \nPRC; and \n(c)  energy efficiency project cycle covering energy audit, list of solutions, \nexpected  savings,  implementation,  and  monitoring  and  reporting; \nincluding various energy efficiency financing structures, energy efficiency \ncredit and risk mitigation, financial product development, etc. \n ", "Appendix 3          9 \n(ii)  Provide specialized training in energy efficiency finance for selected bank staff in \nunderwriting  and  credit  analysis,  risk  assessment  and  mitigation  measures, \nportfolio management, and reporting practices. \n(iii)  Develop  an  internal  marketing  action  plan  to  increase  the  partner  banks\u2019 \nawareness and knowledge in energy efficiency financing, including facilitating \nand organizing workshops and seminars, among others. \n(iv)  Assist management in developing an action plan to scale up energy efficiency \ninitiatives. \n(v)  Work  with  partner  banks  to  develop  external  marketing  materials,  point  out \nmarkets that cater to energy efficiency needs in buildings, and demonstrate ways \nto  promote  energy  efficiency  investments  to  potential  borrowers  and  project \ndevelopers. \n(vi)  Facilitate and organize workshops and seminars to promote energy efficiency \nactivities among government officials and the private sector, design incentive \nmechanism for end borrowers, and disseminate the lessons learned with the \npartner banks. \n \nC.
