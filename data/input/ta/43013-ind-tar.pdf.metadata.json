India's  infrastructure  investment  requirements  are  estimated  at  around  $514  billion \nduring the Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u201320111 to sustain gross domestic product growth at \n9%.  However,  fiscal  constraints  to  meeting  investment  requirements  require  a  significant \nportion, or around $150 billion, to come from the private sector.2 In addition to mitigating fiscal \nconstraints, the Government of India (the Government) is keen to leverage the private sector\u2019s \nservice delivery and project management efficiency. The Government has thus embarked on \nbroad reforms to enable greater private sector participation in infrastructure, emphasizing the \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP) modality.  \n2.  The Government's approach is being supported by several Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) technical assistance (TA) initiatives designed to mainstream PPP in India.3 The TAs are \nfocusing on capacity building for institutionalizing PPPs across the country, developing PPP \nproject  pipelines,  and  for  assisting  states  and  sectors  in  developing  a  supportive  policy \nenvironment. These initiatives have resulted in 23 PPP cells in central and state levels and \nsignificant  mainstreaming  of  infrastructure  development  through  PPP  across  sectors. \nConsequently, over 200 potential PPP infrastructure projects are now entering the market. \nFurther assistance for transaction advisory has also been provided in the health and education \nsectors where the PPP modality has not yet percolated as has support for catalyzing long-term \nfunding for PPPs.4 In light of the success of these initial efforts, the 'next generation' of PPP-\nenabling policies and institutions is required at the national level to streamline and further evolve \nthe PPP policy and enabling environment to ensure consistency across states and to provide \nadditional mechanisms to generate high-quality transactions in the existing and evolving policy \nenvironment. In this context, the TA supports new centralized advisory institutions, procurement \nprocesses,  and  a  PPP  policy  framework  based  on  a  set  of  principles,  as  opposed  to  a \nprescriptive approach. The focus of the TA is to evolve the policy and regulatory environment \nand develop guidance mechanisms to generate high-quality transactions given that the project \npipeline has expanded across sectors.5 The pipeline now extends to sectors where PPP is \nuncommon and involves state government sponsors, where there is a need to further improve \nthe policy, regulatory, and legal framework. \n3.  The objectives for the next generation of PPP reforms is to build upon existing initiatives \nto establish policies, processes, and entities which can assist project sponsors in (i) undertaking \nPPP projects through streamlined processes and principles; (ii) attaining appropriate public \ncontrol  and  monitoring  of  PPP  projects;  (iii)  developing  governance  structures  to  facilitate \ncompetitiveness, equitability, and transparency in PPP procurement; and (iv) ensure that a \nvalue-for-money (VFM) rationale is adopted with optimal risk allocation in project structuring. \n                                                 \n1  Estimates from the Department of Economic Affairs and Planning Commission, Government of India. \n2  The fiscal deficit in India is subject to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003. The act \nrequires the fiscal deficit to be contained at 3% of gross domestic product. While this has been relaxed to support \neconomic stimulation, the limits are expected to be reinstated when the crisis abates.  \n 3  ADB. 2006.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to India for the India Infrastructure Project Financing Facility. Manila.  \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 November 2009.  ", "2     \n4.  Fact-finding and consultation missions in December 2008 and February, March, and \nAugust 2009 finalized the TA scope. The TA is in line with ADB's country operations business \nplan, country partnership strategy, and Strategy 2020, which envisage greater ADB involvement \nin private sector development. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Given the public nature of services provided by a PPP infrastructure facility, the public \nsector sponsor requires a legal-regulatory and policy framework to enter into contracts based on \n(i) transparent and objective processes for project and concessionaire selection, with VFM being \na factor; (ii) clearly defined approval, compliance, and oversight jurisdiction over PPP projects, \nespecially with regard to the rights of municipal and local government authorities; and (iii) clear \ndefinitions  of  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and  rights  of  parties  in  the  governing  instruments \n(concession  agreement,  regulations,  etc.).  The  PPP  legal-regulatory  and  policy  framework \nempowers the private sector to collect and retain revenues and seek revision of user charges. \n6.  Promoting good governance of the project utility and procuring efficient and affordable \nservices are at the heart of PPP. The foundation for accountability and efficiency, crucial to \nprotecting the interests of shareholders and investors, should be provided in the legal-regulatory \nand policy framework. With regard to regulation, a balance must be struck between competing \nissues such as prices, customer service, environment protection, ability to pay, and need to use. \nProvisions  for  extraordinary  price  adjustments  must  be  provided  for  on  specific  and \npredetermined grounds such as a change in service obligations, change in law, breach of \ncontract, scope of Government interventions, and terms such as payment of a subsidy, etc.   \n \n7.  PPP  transactions  under  this  framework  would  involve  private  participants  making \ninvestment arrangements with the grantor of the concession or joint venture partner. Additional \narrangements may include contracts on the sale and/or supply of goods and services including \nengineering,  procurement,  construction,  operation  and  maintenance,  modernization,  and \nfinancing. \n \n8.  A PPP manual based on the legal-regulatory and policy framework will provide public \nand private partners with procedural guidance covering each stage of the PPP development and \nimplementation process. The PPP policy manual should reflect best practices while articulating \nan informative rather than prescriptive approach. It should provide guidance on using PPP in a \nrange of projects across subsectors. The operational and procedural guidance provided in the \nPPP policy framework dovetails the regulatory and legal framework described above. Viewed in \nthis context, the PPP policy manual provides detailed guidance on project identification and \noptional appraisal including VFM analysis, statutory processes and their implications for the \nstructure  of  the  procurement  process  and  the  pattern  of  risk  allocation,  procurement  and \ncontract award, construction, operation, and post-project review.  \n \n9.  This discussion of the legal-regulatory and policy framework underlines the need for the \npublic sector sponsor to (i) fully scope projects, (ii) effectively manage the bidding process, (iii) \nidentify potential risks, and (iv) allocate risks to the project participant best placed to manage \nthem. The focus of the public sector sponsor is on contract development to obtain bids and \nidentify and allocate risk. The public sector sponsor will need to design a suitable procurement \ntimetable,  process,  and  documentation  framework,  especially  for  requesting  proposal \ndocuments. Ideally, the request for proposals should set out details of the project, requirements, \nand deliverables, including legal, financial, design, and technical criteria. In a successful PPP \nproject, the government sponsor is required to appropriately allocate risk in project documents \n ", "  3\nwith an awareness of bidder, financier, and equity issues, as private firms will resist taking on \nrisks that they cannot manage. This requires finalization of project documents, including (i) the \nproject deeds, which grant the right to the private firm to develop the project and govern the risk \nallocation between the government and the project vehicle; (ii) engineering and procurement \ncontracts, which govern the relationship between the project company and the contractor; (iii) \noperation and maintenance contracts, which govern the relationship between the project vehicle \nand the operator and set out the non-core services of the asset and its maintenance for its \nuseful life; and (iv) tripartite agreement(s) among the project vehicle, financiers, government \nsponsor, and other parties. Tripartite agreements allow the public sector sponsor to monitor \nissues under subcontracts.  \n \n10.  Closely aligned with developing a PPP manual and optimizing contracts to suit specific \ntransactions is creating an independent national knowledge-management body to manage and \nsupport the improvement of the legal-regulatory and policy environment. The body will be \nresponsible for managing the development of the PPP manual and PPP policy framework and \nassist in drafting contracts that address transaction-specific issues. \n     \n  III.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA impact will be enhanced private sector investment in infrastructure during the \ncurrent and succeeding 5-year plans, improving infrastructure across the country with private \ninvestment inflows and efficient resource management. \n \n12.  TA outcomes will be an improved PPP-enabling environment with streamlined PPP \nprocesses and guidelines, as well as sector, legal, and regulatory frameworks for catalyzing \nPPP investments. The development of a central PPP entity will enhance the PPP process and \nawareness of it in local, state, and central governments, with streamlined PPP coordination \nbetween government entities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The  TA  will  have  four  core  activities  and  support  supplementary  activities  for  PPP \nmainstreaming to assist in achieving the next generation of PPP development. Core activities \nare developing (i) a national PPP policy framework; (ii) a comprehensive PPP manual to include \nproject development, procurement, and technical guidance; (iii) a national PPP body to provide \nguidance, oversight, and monitoring; and (iv) sector-specific regulatory inputs. \n \n14.  A national principle-based PPP policy framework will be designed under the TA, rather \nthan a prescriptive approach, to foster innovation and flexibility while providing guidance. The \nframework  will  be  designed  to  include  (i)  PPP  principles  and  guidelines  and  (ii)  enabling \ninstruments for PPP policy and knowledge dissemination. International, national, and state best \npractices will be analyzed to develop principles and guidelines for PPP, addressing such issues \nas  PPP  definitions,  processes,  possible  institutions,  project  structures,  and  recommended \nlegislative arrangements. This will require a comprehensive review of PPP legislation,6 including \n                                                 \n6  Laws governing various sectors include the Electricity Act, 2003; Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act,1997; \nand  National  Highway  Authority  of  India  Act,  1998.  Superimposed  on  these  acts  are  binding  rulings  and \ninstruments  issued  by  statute  to  regulate  specific  sectors,  activities,  and  businesses.  These  may  include \nregulations, practice directions, licenses, quality of supply standards, tariff orders, performance standards, safety \nstandards, environmental issues, and case-specific orders.  \n ", "4     \ncentral  and  state  legislation,  regulatory  frameworks  and  rulings,  and  court  orders, \nrecommending legislative changes as appropriate. PPP principles will be developed for each \nsector based on analyses of sector policies and challenges to attracting private investments. \nIndia-specific tools for undertaking VFM and risk analysis will be developed, following a review \nof global practices. Enabling instruments for PPP policy and knowledge dissemination will likely \ninclude a PPP index, a showcase of PPP projects, an infrastructure index tracker for PPP, and \nan annuity-funding scheme modeled on a private finance initiative in the United Kingdom.  \n \n15.  The development of a national level PPP manual will require a comprehensive review of \nexisting  national  and  international  manuals;  PPP-procurement  processes  and  guidelines; \nsector-specific guidance material such as standardized concession agreements and regulatory \nand legal regimes; and PPP-enabling instruments such as the Viability Gap Funding scheme of \nthe Government. As the PPP manual will suggest the role of individual stakeholders according \nto best practice at each stage of project development and implementation, developing the policy \nmanual will require consultation with all stakeholders, including project sponsors, regulators, \ngovernment agencies, developers, and consumers.  \n \n16.  The TA will support the development and institutionalization of the proposed national \nPPP entity, \"3 P India,\" to act as the single reference point for PPP development under the next \ngeneration  of  PPP  mainstreaming  reforms.  Taking  forward  the  concept  developed  by  the \nDepartment of Economic Affairs (DEA), the TA will assist in defining the entity's aims, business \nplans, and operating functions, which may include (i) knowledge management (to oversee \ndevelopment of the PPP manual, PPP policy framework, sector-specific regulatory guidance, \nand to house panels of transaction, technical, financial, and legal advisors); (ii) compliance \n(oversight  of  PPP  processes,  approvals  for  project  structuring,  and  advisory  funding);  (iii) \nregulation (intermediation during project implementation); (iv) project preparation assistance \n(development funds); and/or (v) oversight (a national PPP audit unit for evaluating PPP projects). \nThe TA will review and refine the entity's proposed institutional and legal structure, including its \nshareholding  structure  (100%  government  owned  or  partly  privately  owned),  articles  and \nmemorandums of association, and corporate governance structures.  \n \n17.  An  analysis  of  regulatory  framework  as  per  international  best  practices  will  be \nundertaken to provide guidance on regulatory reform. The proposed regulatory road maps \nwould  be  guided  by  the  need  to  operationalize  new  sector  and  legislative  arrangements. \nAppropriate  training  modules  and  workshops  to  garner  support  for  proposed  will  also  be \ndeveloped.  \n \n18.  In addition to the five core activities (para. 16), the TA will provide support to the DEA in \n(i) evaluating proposed PPP processes and sector and project structures; (ii) PPP knowledge \nmanagement through developing and implementing a communication strategy; and (iii) building \ncapacity to manage the new PPP entity, policy framework, manual, and pipeline of projects for \nprocess approvals under the new PPP frameworks built under the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance \n$1,000,000 equivalent as a grant from its Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other \nsources). The Government will provide the balance of $250,000 to meet local currency costs \nand cover counterpart staff, office facilities, administrative support, facilitation for meetings, and \nother expenses. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The DEA of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing and implementing agency for \nthe TA. Project performance will be periodically appraised by ADB review missions, DEA staff, \nand other stakeholders. Guidance will be sought from the DEA, market participants, and other \nstakeholders to resolve issues that may arise in implementation. A steering committee chaired \nby DEA will be established to ensure the quality of deliverables, adherence to timelines, and \nsuitability  of  suggested  mechanisms  to  suit  Indian  conditions.  The  steering  committee  will \ninclude  line  ministries,  state  and  central  representatives,  and  representatives  of  regulatory \nbodies. \n \n21.  The TA will engage consultancy firms and individuals to undertake core activities in three \ngroups: (i) PPP policy framework and PPP manual development; (ii) the development of the \nnational PPP entity, 3 P India; and (iii) the development of regulatory road maps. In addition, \nconsultancy support will be provided for developing and managing a communications strategy; \nundertaking reviews of proposed policies, process, and structures; and managing the new entity \nand policy frameworks during a transition period in which the DEA\u2019s capacity will be enhanced. \nConsulting inputs are estimated at 106 person-months, both national and international, provided \nby consulting firms and individuals. The consulting firms and individuals must have a broad \nrange  of  skills  in  PPP  and  financial  structuring,  regulatory  economics,  corporate  and \nconstitutional  law,  institutional  development,  management  consultancy,  communications \nexpertise, and project administration. Selection of the firms and individuals will be made in \nconsultation with the DEA and in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance \nwith  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook.7  The  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  DEA will provide the office space and logistical and administrative support necessary to \nimplement the project. Equipment and materials to be financed by the TA will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). 8 TA \nimplementation  will  last  24  months,  from  December  2009  to  December  2011.  ADB  will \ndisseminate project results, and evaluation results will be made available on the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for Assisting in Framework Development for Mainstreaming Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnerships, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.
