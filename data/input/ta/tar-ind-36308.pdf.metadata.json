The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Country Strategy and Program (CSP) Update for \nIndia for 2002 included support for governance and public resource management reforms in the \nstate of Assam. ADB\u2019s India CSP 2003\u20132006, approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 1 May \n2003, reconfirms this support. The Assam government asked ADB for technical assistance (TA) \nto  study  ways  to  prioritize  and  strategically  plan  a  sustainable  and  time-bound  fiscal \nconsolidation  program  of  revenue,  expenditure  and  debt  management,  and  restructuring \nreforms  together  with  a  complementary  governance  program  of  public  administration \nrestructuring,  public  enterprise  restructuring,  and  enhanced  public  service  delivery  and \ndecentralization reforms. The Assam government also requested ADB TA to raise the state\u2019s \ncapacity to implement the reform program. \n \n2.  The TA is part of ADB\u2019s support to prepare and implement the Assam governance and \npublic resource management program loan, which is envisaged for 2004. A fact-finding mission \nvisited Guwahati in May 2003 and reached an understanding with the Assam government on \nthe  purpose  and  output,  methodology,  key  activities,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA.1 The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.   As a consequence of prolonged political disturbances, Assam has progressively fallen \nbehind the rest of the country in economic development. During planned economic development \nfrom 1951 to the 1970s, Assam grew at rates comparable to the rest of the country but has \nsince lagged behind. While India grew by 5.4% during FY1980\u20131990, Assam grew at 3.3%. The \ngap widened further during FY1991\u20131996, with India\u2019s growth at 7.3%, and Assam\u2019s at only 3%. \nPoverty incidence declined from 40.86% in 1993-1994 to 36.00% in 1999\u20132000 in Assam, but \ndropped from 35.97% to 26.10%, almost 10 percentage points, in India as a whole. However, \nsince the numbers for 1993-1994 and 1999-2000 are not fully comparable, the extent of decline \nin poverty incidence in Assam remains unclear. Assam\u2019s infrastructure development index is \nonly 72.7 compared to the national base of 100.  \n \n4.   Reviving growth and accelerating poverty reduction in a service sector- and government-\ndominated economy is a major challenge given the Assam government\u2019s severe fiscal crisis. \nThe fiscal deficit rose steadily from 4.9% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) in FY1990 to \n6.7% in FY2002. Even more disturbing is the high share of revenue deficit, which accounts for \nalmost 58% of the total fiscal deficit in FY1999\u20132001.2 Thus, the large fiscal deficit is mainly \nused to finance revenue (current) expenditure rather than create capital assets. The deficit, in \nturn, adds to the stock of public debt.3 Public debt as a proportion of GSDP is steadily growing\u2014\nfrom 35.2% in FY1999, 38.0% in FY2000, and 40.5% in FY2001. Fiscal consolidation is needed \nif the Assam government is to (i) maintain and improve the state\u2019s existing social and physical \ninfrastructure, (ii) enhance equitable access and quality of publicly provided education and \nhealth services, (iii) prevent the further deterioration of existing physical infrastructure as well as \nother key public services, and (iv) promote economic growth and create jobs. \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 March 2003. \n2 The situation for FY2002 improved as the share of revenue deficit in the fiscal deficit declined to 44%. \n3 This includes contingent liabilities of the Assam government arising from guarantees of loans extended to state \nenterprises. ", "2     \n \n5.   The Assam government has thus initiated a number of measures culminating in a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  with  the  national  Government  on  the  Medium-Term \nFiscal Reform Program (MTFRP): 2000\u20132001 to 2004\u201320054 and the commissioning of the \nAssam Administrative Reforms Commission report of 22 April 2003. The commission raised not \nonly enhancement of government employee efficiency and productivity and rationalization of \nAssam government departments but also other important public administration issues such as \nthe need to enhance government responsiveness. It may hinge on public-private interface \nmechanisms, including timely redress of public grievances, which reinforces accountability and \navoids an adversarial and often dilatory litigation system. Administrative processes and systems \nwill have to be reviewed. \n \n6.   The state has 48 public sector enterprises, including Assam State Electricity Board \n(ASEB)  and  Assam  State  Transport  Corporation  (ASTC),  which  account  for  76%  of  total \ninvestment in public sector enterprises. Instead of providing significant non-tax revenues to the \nstate exchequer, all the enterprises together are incurring net annual losses of about $100 \nmillion (Rs5.1 billion) per year, equivalent to 35% of the Assam government\u2019s FY2001 fiscal \ndeficit. Some enterprises are not even able to pay their employees\u2019 salaries, creating a potential \ncontingent liability for the Assam government budget. Building on the review work of the Assam \ngovernment\u2019s Department of Public Enterprises and the restructuring of enterprises such as \nASTC, an independent, careful review of these enterprises5 is needed to determine which \nshould be shut down, privatized, or restructured. Recommendations need to be in line with the \nMTFRP MOU, the policy of the Tenth Five-Year Plan (FY2003-2007) to reduce the role of \ngovernment in production of goods and services, and a cost-benefit analysis of different options \nsuch as introducing a voluntary retirement scheme for employees of public sector enterprises \nthat require closure or restructuring. \n \n7.   As  an  essential  complement  to  the  reform  and  restructuring  programs  in  Assam \ngovernment departments and state public enterprises, governance reforms need to help refocus \nand restructure the Assam government toward participatory development to promote economic \ngrowth and employment through cost-effective decentralized service delivery. \n \n8.   Under the Assam Panchayat Act of 1994, 6 as many as 29 subjects have been notified \nfor devolution to local governments. Building on the recently concluded panchayat elections and \nthe Assam government\u2019s amendment to the Municipal Administration Act providing for elected \nurban  local  bodies,  governance  reforms  need  to  foster  fiscal  devolution7  to  enable  the \nintroduction  of  decentralized  and  participatory  management  of  public  services  such  as \neducation, health, water supply, and other public services to ensure greater transparency and \naccountability of service providers to beneficiaries. \n \n9.  Taking account of the need for administrative support for decentralized service delivery \nunder the aegis of the panchayat institutions and local bodies, and the potential for buoyancy of \ndecentralized land revenues and property taxes, governance reforms must assess options \nbased on cost-benefit analyses of rationalization of district administration, including land-titling \nreforms. \n \n                                                 \n4 Signed by the Assam government and national Ministry of Finance on 26 March 2003. An MOU on fiscal reforms \nwas signed between the national and Assam governments in January 2000. Governance issues highlighted by the \nlatest MOU include the need to for accountability of Assam government employees such as teachers. \n5 This will not include ASEB, which is being addressed under ADB\u2019s proposed power sector program loan. \n6 Panchayat means a village council. \n7 The Assam government\u2019s Second State Finance Commission has yet to make its recommendations. \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The objective of the TA is to improve  and accelerate development management in \nAssam against the background of the MTFRP MOU by helping the Assam government design \nand sequence priority public resource management and governance reforms, and strengthen its  \nimplementation capacity to implement them. The TA will focus on (i) fiscal reforms to improve \nresource  mobilization,  (ii)  public  expenditure  management  reforms  to  strengthen  fiscal \ndiscipline,  improve  resource  allocation,  and  enable  better  operational  management,  (iii) \nimproved  debt  management  and  fiscal  responsibility  and  budget  management,  and  (iv) \ngovernance and public management reforms to enhance cost-effective, sustainable, and quality \npublic  services  through  decentralized  delivery  and  accountable,  focused,  and  responsive \ngovernment and public sector enterprises limited to an appropriate role. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented under the following four components: \n \n (i) Fiscal reforms (revenues). The TA will help (a) strengthen implementation of the \nsubnational value-added tax (VAT), as well as improve mobilization of other tax and nontax \nrevenues, and (b) strengthen local-body and devolved finances. \n \n(ii) Fiscal reforms (public expenditure management). The TA will include (a) a critical \nreview of intersector and intrasector budget allocations under a public expenditure review to \ndetermine the degree to which they support state social and economic development objectives, \nan adequate level of operation and maintenance for existing infrastructure, and decentralized \ncost recovery, (b) development of departmental medium-term expenditure plans based on such \nreview, reflecting resource allocation consistent with state annual plan and sectoral policy \nobjectives (such as universal literacy and primary health coverage targets), and devolution of \nfinancial  autonomy  commensurate  with  devolved  responsibilities,  and  (c)  development  of \nappropriate performance targets under a state medium-term expenditure framework, based on \nsuch  departmental  plans,  integrated  into  a  fiscal  responsibility  and  budget  management \nframework. \n \n  (iii)  Fiscal  reforms  (debt  and  fiscal  responsibility).  The  TA  will  include  (a) \nconfirmation  of  the  continuing  validity  of  MTFRP  macroeconomic  assumptions  and  fiscal \nperformance  targets,8  (b)  establishment  of  an  overall  state  debt  management  policy,  (c) \nevaluation  of  debt-restructuring  options,  (d)  evaluation  of  fiscal  implications  of  contingent \nliabilities (state guarantees, pensions, etc.), and (e) integration of agreed-on macroeconomic \nassumptions and performance targets into an appropriately sequenced fiscal responsibility and \nbudget management framework. In addition to defining the macroeconomic assumptions and \nthe timing and identification of appropriate performance targets for structural changes in the \nfiscal system under a fiscal responsibility framework, the TA will also support the monitoring of \nsuch performance targets and accompanying institutional strengthening and capacity building. \nThese will include workshop sessions for revenue, expenditure and debt management policy, \nand administration as well as capacity-building seminar sessions where staff from other state \n                                                 \n8  Given  the  regular  monitoring  of  the  MTFRP  contemplated  by  the  national  Government,  and  the  close \ninterrelationship between the MTFRP and TA and potential Assam governance and public resource management \nprogram loan, coordinated joint monitoring of the TA by the national Government and ADB is planned. \n ", "4     \n \ngovernments can share their experience in public finance and governance reforms. Capacity will \nalso be built by establishing and strengthening a monitoring unit within the state Finance \nDepartment. \n \n(iv)  Governance  and  public  management  reforms.  The  TA  will  support  (a) \ndevelopment  of  a  state  governance  assessment  and  strategy,  including  sequencing  and \nbalancing of public administration and public enterprise restructuring reform with devolution of \npublic services; (b) critical review, evaluation, and defined time-bound strategy and action plan \nfor public administration reforms based on an expenditure and functional review of the civil \nservice, including public expenditure tracking surveys; and (c) critical review, evaluation, and \ntime-bound  strategy  and  action  plan  for  public  sector  enterprise  restructuring  reforms, \ndevolution of public services,9 and district administration restructuring.10 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n12.  The TA is estimated at $875,000 equivalent, of which $515,900 is the foreign exchange \ncost and $359,100 equivalent the local currency cost. The entire foreign exchange cost, and \n$184,100  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom. The Assam government will provide $175,000 equivalent to \nfinance part of the local currency costs to cover counterpart staff, office accommodation and \noffice supplies, transport, and other expenses such as for in-country study facilitation and \nworkshops. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The state Finance Department will be the executing agency for the TA. The state \nFinance Department will be supported by a TA implementing unit (TIU) and will appoint a \ncommissioner and secretary of finance as TIU director. The state Finance Department will \nprovide office space, furniture, equipment, and counterpart staff for TA consultants, who will \nreceive operational advice and guidance from the TIU director. The Assam government will set \nup a steering committee on governance and public resource management reforms for the TA, \nchaired by the chief secretary, with the additional chief secretary responsible for finance as the \ndeputy chairman. Members will include commissioners; secretaries of the Finance Department, \nPlanning and Development Department, and Administrative Reforms/Personnel Department, \nand  Department  of  Public  Enterprises;  and  representatives  of  key  line  departments.  The \nsteering committee will be responsible for TA coordination, progress reports to be submitted at \nleast quarterly to the national and Assam governments and ADB, and resolution of any issues \nthat may arise. \n \n14.  All procurement of equipment will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. \n \n15.  ADB will engage a team of consultants to execute the TA: international consultants will \nwork for 19.5 person-months, and domestic consultants, 27.5 person-months. The consultants \nwill have experience and expertise in public finance, VAT and tax administration and legislation, \npublic expenditure review and management, public administration and public sector enterprise \nrestructuring,  utility  pricing,  sectoral user fees and cost recovery, fiscal and administrative \n                                                 \n9 Devolution will be examined in public services such as education, health, water supply, and other agreed-on \nsectors. \n10 Restructuring of district administration will include development administration and land-titling reforms. \n ", "5 \ndecentralization, performance accountability and land titling, settlement, and revenue. A debt \nmanagement  and  restructuring  specialist  will  be  selected  and  engaged  as  an  individual \ninternational consultant in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A firm \nof consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The simplified technical proposal procedure and quality-and-cost-based selection \nwill be used to select the consulting firm. The outline terms of reference of the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. A summary initial poverty and social analysis report is in Appendix 4. \n \n16.  The consultants will prepare an inception report, including a time-bound work plan for TA \nimplementation, within 4 weeks of the start of consulting services. An interim report will be \nsubmitted within 4 months from the start of consulting services. A draft final report will be \nsubmitted 4 weeks before the end of consulting services, to be discussed in a meeting of the \nconsultants,  national  and  Assam  governments,  and  ADB  before  being  finalized  by  the \nconsultants. The TA will be implemented in 8 months. It is expected to start in October 2003 and \nbe completed by June 2004. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n17.
