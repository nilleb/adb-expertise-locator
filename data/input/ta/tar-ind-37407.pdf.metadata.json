Trade and investment creation in \nthe northeast is seen as substantially increasing India\u2019s returns from investment in transport \ninfrastructure  investments  undertaken  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  others. \nMoreover, substantial economic benefits arise from increased subregional trade creations with \nBangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, as subregional trade through northeastern India is at a very \nlow level by international standards. Thus, the Government of India (the Government) requested \nADB for assistance in evaluating the feasibility of trade and investment creation for the private \nsector and, based on the feasibility, to outline possible design for project assistance. The \ntechnical assistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission in April 2004 received strong support for a trade \nand investment creation initiative for the northeastern states of India. The Mission reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, costs, financing, implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services under the TA.1 The TA framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  With globalization more pervasive than ever before, countries and business sectors are \nincreasingly connected via markets, trade, finance, transport, information, and communication. \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal (\u201cthe subregion\u201d) face a unique opportunity to participate \ncompetitively in this global production and trading system. This opportunity will be thwarted \nwhen imperfect markets, barriers to trade in various forms, malfunctioning financial systems, \nserious transport and logistics impediments, and incomplete information and communication all \nsignificantly raise the cost of doing business. Availing of global opportunities for employment \nand income and productivity growth requires addressing domestic and cross-border obstacles, \nsuch as trade-related standards and standards accreditation, for private sector development in \nthe subregion. \n \n3.  India\u2019s 10th Five Year Plan (2002\u20132007) recognizes the importance of reduction in \ntransaction  and  communication  costs  for  increased  interaction  with  the  world  economy. \nMoreover, increases in efficiency and improvements in quality, productivity, and technology are \ncrucial for attaining greater international competitiveness. The northeastern states in India have \nlagged behind other parts of the country in terms of integration into the world economy and \ncompetitiveness. Institutional weaknesses, remoteness from markets, and difficult access have \ntaken  their  toll,  and  left  the  core  of  the  subregion  without  substantial  agglomerations  of \ncommercial and industrial activities. India\u2019s northeastern states could play a pivotal role for \nsubregional integration as a key bridge and centralizing function for economic exchange. The \nbridge function can be extended to include Southeast Asia and the Greater Mekong Subregion. \nHence with a view of the subregion\u2019s bridge function, the 10th Five Year Plan includes a \"growth \ncenters  scheme\"  to  promote  economic  corridors  and  agglomerations  in  hilly,  remote,  and \ninaccessible regions. Within the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), \nIndia is now keen to establish special economic zones for trade creation.  \n \n4.  Recognizing the importance of subregional integration, specialization, and agglomeration \nin a globally connected economy, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal established the South \nAsia Growth Quadrangle. Within India, Assam and West Bengal play an important role for the \nsubregion, and ADB has planned or undertaken investments in these important states. The India \n                                                           \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 9 January 2004. \n ", "2  \nCountry Strategy and Program 2003\u201320062 includes an Assam governance and public resource \nmanagement program as well as a power sector development program, and northeastern states \nroads and northeastern region urban development projects. TA for the North-South Corridor \nDevelopment Project in West Bengal,3 completed in 2000, analyzed the trade and transportation \nflows and costs along subregional transport corridors linking Assam, Bihar, Orissa, and the \nneighboring  countries  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  and  Nepal  (water,  rail,  and  roadlinks)  in  West \nBengal. The regional TA analyzed financial, institutional, and legal issues of subregional trade \nand  transport,  including  transport  regulation  and  institutions,  international  trade  and  transit \nagreements  and  legal  framework  for  public-private-partnerships.  The  TA  also  explored  the \nviability of an \u201ceconomic corridor\u201d concept. The concept was found to be viable for substantial \npublic and private financing. The government of West Bengal has been very supportive of the \nconcept, which is now also underlying the design of transport connections from West Bengal to \nBangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal under an ADB-financed TA in 2003.4 \n \n5.  At the request of the participating countries, ADB initiated a series of TAs to support \ndevelopment through ADB\u2019s South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Program. \nIn December 2002, ADB approved a small-scale TA to examine nontariff-barriers that are being \nmaintained by SASEC countries.5 The idea of a subregional standards accreditation has been \nput forward. Another TA approved in 2003 examines the operational efficiency of subregional \ntransport  corridors.6  The  proposed  TA  fits  into  the  TA  series,  as  trade  and  investment \ndevelopment with private sector involvement is one of the five SASEC priority sectors. The \nregional cooperation strategy and program currently being drafted includes a prospective private \nsector development loan for 2005 in the ADB lending program for India to facilitate private sector \nparticipation  in  the  northeastern  economy  and  to  enhance  the  market  environment  for \ncompetition and productivity critical for higher economic growth and reduction of poverty along \nan economic corridor. \n \n6.  A missing and crucial element for trade creation in the SASEC region, and from it, is the \ndevelopment of the public-private sector infrastructure, particularly the market, trade, finance, \nand information infrastructure along the prospective physical corridors, to catalyze the economic \ncorridors that could be riding successfully on the transport and communication corridors. The \neconomic corridor concept finds strong support from the private sector, and the government has \nexpressed strong interest in implementing this concept for investment. \n \n7.  While  pervasive  globalization  connects  and  integrates  markets  and  thus  builds \ncomparative  advantage,  it  also  enables  greater  specialization,  decentralization,  and \nagglomeration of specialized services, production, and distribution. Specialization in a global \nchain  of  inputs  and  markets  leads  to  tremendous  gains,  with  economic  opportunities  for \nemployment and income growth in a subregion. Outsourcing to reduce the cost of production \nand service centers helps global firms improve their competitiveness, and at the same time \ninduces subregional firms to contribute their strength. Concentration of low-cost activities in low-\ncost locations leads to agglomeration gains (so called \u201clocalization economies\u201d) and allows firms \nto reap economies of scale. When many firms are close together, benefits include exchange of \nknowledge and local buyer-supplier networks. Employees with specific skills will be attracted to \nfirm clusters and economic corridors giving access to a specialized labor pool. These gains can \n                                                           \n2  ADB.2003. Country Strategy and Program (2003-2006): India. Manila. \n3  ADB. 1998.

ADB\u2019s trade and investment creation initiative for the northeast is timely and necessary \nto improve the market environment for trade and investment in the northeastern states and to \nprovide some comfort needed for potential private sector investments. For instance, Industrial \nCredit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) has, over the last year or so, invested about \n$400 million in innovative agro-businesses in India, but none of these investments took place in \nthe northeast. This confirms a recent ADB study that in fiscal year 2002, Assam concluded no \nforeign direct investment (FDI) approvals, whereas Delhi alone concluded about 1,300. ADB-\nsupported trade and investment creation efforts should focus on specific sectors that have high \ngrowth potential and would exploit complementarities in the subregion. Some parts of Assam \nand the more remote states in the east have unexploited natural resources, the band linking \nNepal with Bhutan through part of West Bengal and through Sikkim has high agro-business \npotential, and services sectors are also prevalent. West Bengal\u2019s south provides information, \ncommunication, and transport linkage to the rest of the world. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA will aim to increase the capacity of the private sector in northeastern India to \nsuccessfully transform itself in response to the challenges and issues facing the subregion in \ninternational markets. The TA is to help realize a vision in which the SASEC economies are \nmore closely integrated economically, and are characterized by intensified global and intra-\nregional  transport,  communication  and  information,  trade,  and  investment  activities.  The \npurpose of the TA is to develop an investment framework that will enable northeastern India to \nbetter position itself to participate in global and regional markets, and reap the considerable \ngains from specialization, decentralization, and agglomeration economies. Thus the private \nsector will increase its productivity, while the northeast of India can increasingly serve as an \nimportant  land  bridge  for  trade  between  South  Asia  and  Southeast  Asia  and  the  Greater \nMekong Subregion. The action plan will help the private sector set up the collective institutions \nthat maintain low transaction costs, which identify new economic opportunities, and enhance the \ntransparency of the factor, service (including financial), and labor markets. These in turn provide \nemployment and attract domestic and foreign investments. The action plan will enhance the \nconditions of private-sector-led growth by responding to the need of a competition-enhancing \npolicy framework, and an institutional set-up that provides an open and competitive field, and \n(as much as possible) equal opportunities among sectors and types of firms. A plan for a \nsubregional standards accreditation will be detailed by the TA. The plan will also propose an \nexport support facility for private sector development.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will have four components, which will be implemented in sequence. \n \n11.  Component 1: Identifying an Emerging Comparative Advantage for Northeastern \nStates\u2019 Industry and Services Sectors. The consultants will analyze geographic economic \nactivity of firms in northeast India. This will be analyzed in the context of SASEC countries. \nThen, firm-based trade volumes and values, degree of export diversification, and related trends \n(among others) will be analyzed. New export opportunities that may emerge from trends will be \nlinked to specific international market networks (Asia, Europe, and North America). Export \n ", "4  \nopportunities will be seen in view of World Trade Organization (WTO) standards and norms that \nhave come, or will come into force with completion of India\u2019s WTO accession. \n \n12.  Component  2:  Identifying  Policy,  Legal  and  Regulatory,  and  Institutional \nConstraints to the Private Sector for Northeastern India. The consultants will, among others, \nreview and analyze India\u2019s trade and investment policies, including those on FDI, and assess \ntheir  relevance  and  adequacy  for  northeastern  states.  The  consultants  will  establish  FDI \ncomplementarities among the SASEC countries. The review will also focus on state policies. A \nfactor market (input) analysis and action plan of northeast India will be undertaken including an \ninstitutional-legal  analysis  for  trade  and  investment  enhancement  (e.g.,  simplification  of \nbusiness registration, and improvement of financing channels). \n \n13.  Component  3:  Designing  an  Export  Support  Facility  for  Private  Sector \nDevelopment. The consultants will survey the facilities available to or lacking in businesses \noperating in promising sectors (e.g., debt financing and its terms, maturities, mezzanine, equity \nfinancing, insurance, credit enhancements, etc.). To fill any gaps, a support mechanism could \nbe catalyzed to overcome identified obstacles to increased competitiveness for northeast India\u2019s \nprivate sector. Consultants will develop the institutional, management, market, financing, legal, \nand regulatory aspects in a business plan for the export support facility. The possible role of the \nNorth Eastern Development Finance Corporation in the export support facility will be examined \nand specified. The consultants will determine ADB\u2019s role in any support mechanisms and help \nreach  agreement  on  the  participation  of  stakeholders,  including  the  private  sector  and \ninternational technology and knowledge partners. \n \n14.  Component  4:  Developing  Project  Concepts  in  Response  to  Private  Sector \nConstraints. Based on the preceding analysis, the consultants will develop detailed concepts \nfor specific project components that may be prepared for ADB financing. Viable concepts have \nto be accompanied by economic impact analysis including summary poverty, social (Appendix \n2), and environment impact assessment. The analysis must clearly identify and measure public \ngoods emanating from public sector support of private sector development along economic \ncorridors,  networks,  and  zones,  due  to,  for  instance,  improved  factor  supplies,  lowered \ninformation barriers, stronger market linkages, and private sector networks (e.g., imitation of \nsuccessful  exporters,  improvements  of  product  quality,  and  spread  of  technology  in  the \nnortheastern  economy).  The  setting-up  of  a  subregional  standard  accreditation  body  and \ncalibration service will be examined. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, comprising $394,000 in \nforeign exchange and $231,000 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will provide $500,000 to cover the entire foreign \nexchange  cost  of  $394,000  and  $106,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment will provide the remaining $125,000 of the local currency cost in kind. Details of the \ncost estimates are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  the  Department  of  Development  of \nNortheastern  States  (DONER),  Government  of  India.  The  North  Eastern  Council  will  be  a \nconsultative body to the TA. A business consultative group comprising representatives from the \n ", "  5\nprivate sector and select government ministries will be set up. Coordination among various \nareas  of  the  Government  will  be  facilitated  through  a  steering  committee  including \nrepresentation from the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Finance, \nand DONER. \n \n17.  An international consulting team in association with a domestic team will be engaged to \nimplement the TA. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. Consultant selection will be based on the quality and cost-based selection \nmethod using the simplified technical proposal. The TA will require about 13 person-months of \nservice  from  international  consultants  with  expertise  in  (i)  supply  chain  analysis,  with  a \nbackground in subregional connectivity projects; (ii) trade and industrial organization economics; \n(iii) impact evaluation (including direct-indirect poverty, social aspects, and environment); (iv) a \nlegal expert with speciality in competition law and anti trust, and private sector regulation; (v) a \nmanagement and/or institutional expert for establishing export support mechanisms; and (vi) \nmarketing  support  and  international  supply  chain  and  market  access  and  export  zone \ndevelopment. An additional 16 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required \nin the same disciplines. The consulting services will be carried out over 8 months from October \n2004 to June 2005. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for preparing the Northeastern States Trade and Investment Creation \nInitiative, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators  And Risks \nGoal       \nIncreased private sector  Comparative advantage of  Labor and capital market   \nability (domestic and  key sectors in the  analysis, giving estimates \nforeign) to transform and  subregion (e.g.,  of labor and resource \nrespond to export  northeastern states,  intensities and value \npotential and promising  Bangladesh, Bhutan,  added. \nmarkets that are opening  Nepal). \nExport unit cost \nup within the new \nSpeed of reallocation of  developments when \ninternational trade regime. \nresources among sectors  compared to those of \n  (toward labor-intensive, or  competitors. \nnatural resource-intensive \nones, and the ones with \nhigher value added) and \nwithin sectors, for more \nproductive providers. \nPurpose       \nEnhance and intensify the  Lower transaction costs  Transaction cost estimates  Capacity of institutions to \ncompetitive environment  (including information and  for key, representative  maintain monitoring \nfor the private sector.  coordination costs) from  transactions.  mechanism and to meet \nimproved legal and  project targets. \nRemove supply  Productivity indicators of \ninstitutional environment. \nconstraints, market  key sectors.

Based \non these results, a project framework will be devised, using the sector development project \nformat of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), including a policy matrix, sector analysis, and \ncause-effect analysis. \n \nTable A4: Consultants' Roles in the Components \nExpert  Component 1  Component 2  Component 3  Component 4 \n  Sub-  Sub-      Sub- Sub-\ncomponent  component  component  component \nSupply Chain:  Support  Lead \n1 international, 1 domestic  2(v) and (ix)        4 (i) \u2013 (iv)   \nTrade and Industrial  \nOrganization:  Lead   \n1 international, 2 domestic  2 (i) \u2013 (xiii)           \nImpact Evaluation:  Support    Lead \n1 international   2(xiii)          4 (v) \u2013 (viii) \nLegal and Private Sector \nRegulation:  Support  Lead  Support \n1 international, 1 domestic  2 (xi)    1(i) \u2013 (vii)  3 (xiii)     \nManagement for Support  Lead \nVehicles:  Support  3 (i) \u2013 (xii) \n1 international, 1 domestic    2 (xvii)         \nMarket Access and Export \nZones  Lead   Support \n2 international, 1 domestic    2 (xiv) \u2013 (xvii)    3 (iv)     \n \n3.  The team will prepare an inception report within 6 weeks of the start of consulting \nservices. This report will assess the investment feasibility, and then detail the field services \n ", "    Appendix 4  11 \nrequired for assessing economic impact (including direct and indirect poverty impact). The \ninception report will also contain an initial business plan with operating budget for the planned \nexport support facility. The inception report will be discussed at a stakeholders meeting that will \nbe organized by the consultant team. An interim (midterm) report will be submitted about 3.5 \nmonths after the start of services. The report will contain a draft project framework. Any study \ntour will be detailed and implemented by the team. The interim report will be peer-reviewed by \nADB staff, possibly in conjunction with a visit of the team leader to headquarters. A draft final \nreport,  to  be  submitted  about  7  months  into  the  consultancy,  will  coincide  with  another \nworkshop, or a similar event as necessary, to present and facilitate the dissemination of the \nfindings and recommendations of the TA to private sector interests and Government officials. \nThroughout the work, the team will cooperatively and iteratively assess investment feasibility \nand detail the prospective project. A final report in both hard copy and electronic form will \nincorporate the comments of the Government and ADB. As deemed necessary, the team leader \nwill present key findings at ADB headquarters in Manila at midterm or at the final stage of the \nTA.  \n \nA.

(iii) Quantify the \noverall export diversification of the northeastern states on a three and/or four-digit Institutional \nStandard Industry Code (ISIC) sector level. (iv) Calculate subregional unit export values over a \nperiod of time at a sufficient sector level. Relate the values to standards of international export \ncompetitiveness. Discern trends to identify strengths and weaknesses in export development, \n(v) With the supply chain specialists and based on a focused business survey, analyze and \nbenchmark  typical  business  transactions  and  their  transaction  costs.  (vi)  View  export \nopportunities from the perspective of World Trade Organization (WTO) norms that will come into \nforce in People's Republic of China and India in 2005. (vii) The focused business survey will \nidentify key exporters, their specialization and their location, among others, and use survey \ninputs from exporters for a detailed demand analysis of proposed project interventions. (viii) \nAnalyze the structure of firm sizes, output (i.e., production and value added), and employment \nand compare this in the subregion for eventual complementarities. (ix) With the help of the \nsupply chain specialist, determine  the geographic concentration of economic activity along \nsupply  and  logistics  chains,  and  economic  corridors.  (x)  Review  and  analyze,  also \ngeographically, the employment situation and labor markets, associated collective institutions \n(specifically employer and labor representative groups involved in consultative and compliance \ninstitutions), and the resulting labor market dynamics. (xi) Analyze institutions, including the \nenforcement and implementation capabilities of key collective labor market institutions. (xii) \nAnalyze factor markets other than labor, including the key economic sectors. (xiii) Make a \nsummary poverty (direct and indirect) impact analysis, following ADB\u2019s advanced standards of \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \neconomic analysis including policy-based operations. This leads to a cause-effect analysis, \nsupported by the work of the impact evaluation specialists. \n \n5.  In  addition,  market  access specialists  (2  international  and  1  domestic;  3.0  and  2.0 \nperson-months respectively) will undertake the following tasks: (i) Link export opportunities to \nspecific international market networks in Asia, Europe, and North America.

(v) \nReview the availability of modern trade finance mechanisms (bank credit instruments and their \nelectronic transmission, and related payment risk transfer). \n \nB.  Identifying  Policy,  Legal  and  Regulatory,  and  Institutional  Constraints  to  the \nPrivate Sector for Northeastern India (Component 2) \n6.  The legal experts (international and domestic; 1.0 and 4.0 person-months, respectively) \nwill, among others, review and analyze India\u2019s and the relevant Indian states\u2019 competition \npolicies, including those for foreign direct investment, and evaluate the institutional setup and \ncapabilities  for  an  open  and  competitive  private  sector  economy.  This  review  will  be \ncomplemented by the trade and industrial organization economists\u2019 analysis of industry and \nservice sector organizations (firm sizes, production, value added, employment, entry and exit \ndynamics, geographic location, economic corridors, trade zones and sector networks, factor \nmarket analysis, risk mitigation mechanisms for the private sector). A subregional comparison \nwith Bhutan and Nepal will be undertaken to reveal eventual trade complementarities. Specific \ntasks of the consultants are as follows: (i) List and review private sector development and \nregulation (regulatory bodies), and industry sector and investment regulation in India and the \nstates. (ii) Establish what antitrust legislation and capabilities should be in place. Examine \naccounting and disclosure, double taxation issues, build-operate-transfer policy, public-private \npartnership laws, etc; (iii) Investigate the start-up hurdles (e.g., business registration), including \nproperty right issues that prevent the private sector from obtaining a critical mass in promising \nmarket niches. (iv) Investigate the legal instrumentation or regimes available to India and to the \nnortheastern  states  to  develop  economic  corridors  and  export  zones.

The management expert for finance vehicles (international and domestic; 2.5 and 1.0 \nperson-months, respectively) will (i) design an export support facility to overcome identified \nprivate sector hurdles on the way to increased competitiveness; (ii) examine and specify the \npossible role of the Northeastern Development Finance Corporation, or a similar organization, in \nany support mechanism; and (iii) develop the institutional, management, market, financing, legal \nand regulatory aspects in a business plan for the mechanism. The legal and market access \nexperts will support this work. The consultants will undertake the following specific tasks: (i) \nSurvey the support mechanisms currently available (or lacking) for businesses operating in \npromising sectors. (ii) Consider appropriate funding sources and mechanisms (other than ADB \nand the Government). Possible sources include common service and business infrastructure \n ", "    Appendix 4  13 \nlevy on sectors that benefit from network and agglomeration impacts, or mechanisms to access \nfinancial markets (both dollars and rupees). (iii) Develop the institutional (including management \nand expertise) requirements and financing, legal, and regulatory aspects for the business plan \nof an export support facility for private sector key trade and business corridors and chains that \nexhibit public goods aspects. (iv) Take a value chain or network perspective, as determined by \nthe market access specialist. (v) Recommend, under the export support facility, a support \nmechanism for engaging SMEs in feasibility studies (and up to the point of invitations for \ntender).  The  experience  of  India's  export  marketing  funds  and  the  Productivity  Fund  with \nIndustrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) is applicable. (vi) Give particular \nattention to the link between support of preinvestment services (for instance legal assistance for \nsetting  up  sector-specific  research  and  development  units,  proposals  for  setting  up  new \nproduction processes and for launching new products), and established financing mechanisms. \nThe experience of India's Program for the Advancement of Commercial Technology (PACT) \nwith ICICI is applicable. (vii) Determine (a) ADB\u2019s role in the export mechanism, and help reach \nagreement on the participation of stakeholders, including the private sector and international \ntechnology and knowledge partners; and (b) the role of the central and state governments: \nstates  in  the  northeast  face  strong  fiscal  constraints.  (viii)  Set  out  licensing  requirements, \ngovernance, management, contractual relationships, and functions of contracting parties under \nan export support facility. Include drafting of organizational documents, standard operating \nprocedures with selection criteria for accessing the facility, and a conflict of interest policy. (ix) \nDevelop and update as needed a draft prospectus setting out the business plan, including the \napproach to selection of target markets and market potential in addressing, for instance, the \ninformation,  and  agglomeration  network  and  constraints  to  private  sector  development.

Developing  Project  Concepts  in  Response  to  Private  Sector  Constraints \n(Component 4) \n8.  Detailed  concepts  for  specific  project  components  and  programs  for  possible  ADB \nfinancing (such as setting up a subregional standards accreditation mechanism and calibration \nservice) should be prepared, including associated impact analysis as the concepts may be \nidentified by other experts of the team (leading to, if applicable, implementation arrangements). \nViable concepts have to be accompanied by an economic impact analysis that clearly identifies \nand  measures  public  goods  emanating  from  public  sector  support  of  private  sector \ndevelopment,  due  to,  for  instance,  improved  factor  supplies,  lowered  information  barriers, \nstronger market linkages, private  sector networks, etc. An impact evaluation specialist will \nprimarily undertake impact analysis. \n \n9.  The  supply  chain  experts  (international  and  domestic;  2.0  and  3.0  person-months, \nrespectively) will undertake these tasks: (i) Assemble the data that traces enterprise linkages \n(hard,  soft,  and  information),  including,  subregional  linkages  through  logistics  chains;  and \ncoordinate with ADB subregional-corridor study. This should be done at least for the top three \nexport sector opportunities identified. (ii) Build a logistics model, including estimation of trade \nimpacts  from  logistics  improvements.  (iii)  Analyze  logistics  chains  to  establish  enterprise \nsavings from chain improvements and potential investments. (iv) Analyze container traffic by \nbox  size  and  major  origin  and  destination  pairs,  also  relating  to  neighboring  landlocked \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \ncountries. Examine the rail transit routes linking the northeast and landlocked countries to \nKolkata and Haldia ports, or other port outlets. Identify improvements for coordinating container \nmovements across the subregion including minimizing dry ports and empty containers. \n \n10.  The impact evaluation specialist (international, 2.5 person-months) will undertake the \nfollowing  tasks:  (i)  Analyze  employment  by  income  levels  and  geographic  location  (poor, \nmedium  people  and  rich  households).  (ii)  In  the  light  of  identified  project  and  program \ninterventions, provide a geographic analysis with a network model of economic activities and \nclusters,  economic  corridors  and  trade  zones,  and  their  interrelationship  and  interactions. \nAssess gains from greater market specialization, decentralization along a supply chain, and \nagglomeration of specialized services, production, and distribution. (iii) Undertake a summary \nenvironment  and  social  impact  analysis  (in  conjunction  with  poverty  impact  analysis).  The \nenvironmental assessment will follow ADB's Guidelines on Environmental Assessment. It will \ninclude  environmental  safeguards  for  any  matching  fund  component  and  will  review  the \nenvironmental implications of a policy matrix. (iv) For the impact analysis, take into account \nADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, and adhere to ADB's standards and \nprocedures on social and environmental impact analysis. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20050303104648+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041018104732+08'00'", "Title": "RENAMEDBYADMWHILEHIDDENTOALLOWDUPLICATEACCELERATORS", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Author": ""}}
