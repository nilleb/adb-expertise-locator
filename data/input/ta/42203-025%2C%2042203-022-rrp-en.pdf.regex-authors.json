THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the additional financing of the Northern \nRural Infrastructure Development Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  Inadequate  productive  rural  infrastructure  (PRI)  is  a  critical  constraint,  limiting \nagricultural  and  rural  development  in  the  northern  provinces  of  Bokeo,  Louang-Namtha, \nOudomxai, and Phongsali. In 2010, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a $23 million \ngrant to finance the Northern Rural Infrastructure Development Sector Project.2 Based on the \ncurrent project\u2019s good performance and solid achievements, the government and the ADB \nproject team concluded that PRI investments should be scaled-up to broaden the benefits of \nincreased rural incomes and economic development. The additional financing will enable the \ncontinued  improvement  of  PRI,  consisting  of  small  and  medium-sized  gravity-fed  irrigation \nschemes and rural access to and within the schemes. It will support the implementation of 22 \nnew PRI subprojects, in addition to the 26 subprojects already completed in the current project. \nWith  the  additional  financing,  the  overall  project  will  strengthen  the  (i)  water  user  groups \n(WUGs) to manage PRI and the associated watersheds, and (ii) farmer producer groups (FPGs) \nto coordinate with markets. The inclusion of women, poor people, and ethnic groups will remain \na priority. Consistent with the current project, the additional financing will lead to increased \nagricultural productivity, diversification, and commercialization, resulting in higher incomes in the \nsubproject areas. Moreover, PRI is essential to counter the impacts of climate instability on \nagricultural production. The current project\u2019s approach and structure remain valid.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Some 70% of the Lao PDR population continues to be engaged in agriculture, and over \n50%  of  households  are  smallholder farmers. The  average  poverty rate  in the four  project \nprovinces is 26%. Significantly, 73% of the residents are from ethnic groups that have little \nopportunity to integrate into the market economy. The northern region is still dominated by \nsubsistence production on rain-fed lowlands, as well as upland shifting cultivation. The poor \nquality and inadequate coverage of PRI constrain agricultural production, especially in the dry \nseason, resulting in limited areas being planted, low yields, limited diversity of produce, high \nproduction and marketing costs, and consequently, low rural incomes.4 \n \n4.  Developing  PRI  is  a  high  priority  of  the  government\u2019s  Five  Year  National  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan VIII, 2016\u20132020 and Agriculture Development Strategy to 2025 \nand Vision to the Year 2030 because (i) it is crucial to reducing the risk associated with rain-fed \nagriculture, (ii) it enhances productivity, and (iii) it provides options for diversifying into new \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Northern Rural Infrastructure Development Sector Project. Manila. \n3  ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  Preparing  the  Northern  Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Sector Project\u2014Due Diligence of Additional Financing (TA 8882-LAO). This was complemented by \nresources from the current project which were used to carry out subproject impact studies and two feasibility \nstudies. \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2   \ncrops  with  higher  potential for  profit.5 Given  the  importance  of  PRI,  the government\u2019s  last \nirrigation diagnostic study completed in 2008, needs to be updated immediately.6 Improving \nrural access to and within the irrigation schemes facilitates the mobility of the local population, \nand  the  movement  of  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs,  increasing  production  efficiency. \nInvestments in PRI have enhanced agricultural productivity by securing supplementary water \nsupplies through the wet season and, where possible, providing water for dry season cropping. \nADB has supported the development of transport corridors and regional economic integration in \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion, which has increasingly made markets accessible for Lao PDR \nproduce and will be further enhanced by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic \nCommunity. The overall project remains consistent with the midterm review of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020, as well as the operational plans for agriculture and natural resources, and water.7 \n \n5.  Strong positive impacts and key lessons. Socioeconomic impact studies on the first \nthree  completed  subprojects  showed  year  round  increased  areas  under  cultivation,  with \nsignificant  cropping  diversity,  especially  during  the  dry  season.  WUGs  are  providing  the \nbackbone for PRI sustainability through organized operation and maintenance (O&M) and are \nevolving into FPGs that can negotiate production contracts with traders for more commercially \noriented production. Market demand for the crops produced is high in Lao PDR and neighboring \ncountries, especially the People\u2019s Republic of China. These developments have underpinned \neconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs), which average 22%, and from 2010 to 2015 a 92% \nincrease in average annual household incomes of $1,320 in the subprojects areas.8 \n    \n6.  Project  performance.  The  current  project  is  performing  well  and  is  on  track,  as \nrecorded in all project progress reports,   review mission aide-m\u00e9moire, and as measured by \nADB\u2019s  performance  indicators. 9  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  has \ndemonstrated the capacity to implement ADB-financed projects effectively. As of 31 January \n2017, the current project has achieved (i) good construction quality and the completion of all 26 \nPRI  subprojects,  within  budget,  and  well  before  the  project  closing  date; 10  (ii)  99.6% \nimplementation progress against the elapsed grant period of just over 91.4%, with cumulative \ncontract awards at $20.54 million (89%) and disbursements at $20.84 million (91%); and (iii) \neffective management of identified risks, and timely and satisfactory compliance with all grant \ncovenants, including those concerned with financial management and safeguards. \n \n7.  Significant  benefits  in  excess  of  those  originally  predicted  have  led  to  strong \ndemand by the government and beneficiaries for additional financing\u2014first recorded during the \nmidterm review in April 2014. The importance of this well-performing project is shown by the \ngovernment\u2019s prioritization of this project for ADB\u2019s resources, which will be used to scale up the \n                                                \n5  The Government of Lao PDR, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2015.

(accessible  from  the  list  of  supplementary \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n9  The Ministry of Planning and Investment and ADB\u2019s Lao PDR Resident Mission ranked the current project first in \ngood project implementation practice in 2014 through the annual recognition award. \n10  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \noutputs so that the overall project (i) remains technically feasible, economically viable, and \nfinancially  sound;  (ii)  fulfills  the  high  priority  that  the  government  accords  PRI;  and  (iii) is \nconsistent with its development objectives and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 \nfor the Lao PDR.11 The overall project will continue to use a sector modality, which has proven \nto  be  efficient  and  effective.  Based  upon  the  provincial  development  plans,  candidate \nsubprojects have been identified, screened against eligibility criteria and prioritized, have been \nagreed  among  MAF,  the  participating  provinces,  and  ADB,  for  inclusion  in  the  overall \nsubproject, contingent upon successful feasibility study confirmation.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the overall project will be improved rural household incomes in the four \nnorthern provinces of Bokeo, Louang-Namtha, Oudomxai, and Phongsali. The outcome will be \nincreased agricultural productivity in the four northern provinces of Bokeo, Louang-Namtha, \nOudomxai, and Phongsali. The impact and outcome remain unchanged from the current project, \nbut the aggregated impacts and outcomes of the overall project will increase as the geographic \ncoverage has been expanded to 22 new subprojects  and 5,100 additional households. A total \nof 9,100 households will benefit directly from the project. \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The current project\u2019s four outputs will be scaled up as described below. \n \n10.  Output 1: Production and productivity-enhancing rural infrastructure constructed \nand/or rehabilitated. The implementation of PRI subprojects represents the bulk of the project \ninvestment. The current project completed 26 subprojects covering 5,300 hectares (ha), which \nis a much greater area than the target of 2,900 ha. An additional 22 subprojects covering about \n6,800 ha will be implemented through the additional financing. The 48 total subprojects will \ncomprise about 12,100 ha of irrigated command area and 225 kilometers of rural access road.12 \nPRI subprojects will be extended to three new districts in the overall project.13 Subproject \nfeasibility studies on two representative subprojects in the new districts were carried out during \nproject preparation and confirmed subproject viability.14 \n \n11.  Output  2:  Productivity  and  impact-enhancing  initiatives  adopted.  Initiatives  to \nenhance the impact and sustainability of investments in PRI will continue. They will be identified \nin a participatory and gender-sensitive manner from options developed with stakeholders and \nbeneficiaries, including (i) strengthening technical extension services to WUGs; (ii) establishing \n48  FPGs  to  coordinate  supplies  of  agricultural  produce  to  markets  and/or  processors; \n(iii) supporting contracted agricultural production; and (iv) implementing initiatives to secure land \ntenure for 5,000 WUG members and to protect the health of 48 watersheds. Capacity building \nwill continue to ensure that women and vulnerable ethnic groups have the necessary skills to \nparticipate fully in, and benefit from, project activities.  \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2011.

The additional financing will \nsupport 22 subprojects, amalgamating 73 sub-schemes. \n13 The subprojects are and will be implemented in the districts of (i) Houayxay, Paktha, and Pha-Oudom in Bokeo \nprovince; (ii) Long and Sing in Louang-Namtha province; (iii) Beng (new) and Houn (new) in Oudomxai province; \nand (iv) Boun-Nua (new), Boun-Tai, and Gnod-Ou in Phongsali province. \n14 Subproject Feasibility Study for Nam Beng; and Subproject Feasibility Study for Nam Oun (accessible from the list \nof supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4   \n \n12.  Output 3: Capacities of national, provincial, and district agencies strengthened to \nenable a sector development approach. Capacity building in MAF\u2014as well as improving \nimplementation capacity for staff at the national project management office (NPMO), provincial \nproject  offices  (PPO),  and  district  coordination  offices\u2014are  largely  completed  but  will  be \ncontinued to target the three new districts. An irrigation subsector review will also be carried out. \n \n13.  Output 4: Project managed and subprojects delivered efficiently and effectively. \nThe NPMO and the PPOs will continue to manage the project. Regular ADB review missions \nconfirm  that  established  financial,  administrative,  procurement,  and  reporting  systems  are \neffective and will be continued. Consulting services for implementation support and technical \nexpertise will be extended or recruited as required. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n14.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $35.6 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources as additional financing to finance the increased scope of the overall project. \nThe grant will fund PRI subprojects (including associated initiatives), capacity building, project \nmanagement and consulting services, and applicable taxes and duties.15 The government will \nfinance the equivalent of $2 million for the salaries of full-time permanent counterpart staff, \noffice space, land acquisition and resettlement costs, the clearing of unexploded ordnance and \n                                                \n15 ADB will finance taxes and duties for the expenditure items it covers, operating costs (i.e., incremental project \nmanagement costs but not salaries or remuneration other than travel costs and daily subsistence allowance for \ngovernment officials who work for the project), transportation costs, and interest and bank charges related to the \nimprest account. The following principles were followed in determining taxes and duties to be financed by ADB: (i) \nthe amount does not represent an excessive share of the project; (ii) the taxes and duties apply only to ADB-\nfinanced expenditures; (iii) the amount is within the thresholds identified during the country partnership strategy \npreparation process; and (iv) financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to project success. \n ", "5 \nland  mines,  and  applicable  taxes  and  duties  on  items  paid  for  by  the  government.

Meetings will be arranged \nwith WUGs, FPGs, village leaders, and poor households to identify their needs and raise \nawareness to enable access to benefits, including training and village-level participation in \nsubproject planning and implementation. \n \n19.  Project management has been supported by an implementation consulting firm recruited \nunder the current project. MAF confirmed that the firm provided highly satisfactory services, \nwhich  are  still  needed to  support the  additional financing.  Continuing  the firm\u2019s  consulting \nservices is in the overall interest of the project implementation and enhances economy and \nefficiency. Therefore, the firm\u2019s contract will be extended to cover the new project scope, \nthrough a contract variation.17 Separate consulting packages will be procured for engineering \ndesign and construction supervision, through advance actions, to prepare the detailed designs \nand contract documents for the two representative subprojects. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  PRI  uses  basic  engineering  designs  and  can  be  constructed  by  local  contractors. \nClimate instability is anticipated and a number of countermeasures will be taken, including \n(i) strengthening  the  weir  design  to  withstand  more  intense  stream  flows;  (ii) constructing \npassages to reduce stress on aquatic life by enabling aquatic migration up- and downstream of \nthe weirs; (iii) concrete-lining canals to the extent possible for more efficient utilization of water; \n(iv) increasing the stability of the PRI and the health of the watersheds through soil and water \nconservation initiatives; and (v) involving WUGs and FPGs in the implementation of watershed \nmanagement plans. ADB and MAF prescreened all proposed subprojects for initial technical, \nfinancial, economic, and social viability, as well as for safeguard issues.18 \n \n                                                \n17 The terms of reference for the implementation consultants are in the PAM (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n18 Field Survey Report (Subproject Screening) (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The representative subprojects in Nam Beng and Nam Oun will rehabilitate PRI to \nenable year round irrigated agriculture, resulting in increased cropping intensity. The economic \nand  financial  analysis  considers  as  benefits  only  those  that  are  quantifiable  and  directly \nattributable to PRI improvement. These include (i) increased yield and cropping intensity, (ii) \ncrop diversification, and (iii) reduced transportation costs from the farm gate to the rice mills or \nlocal markets. Benefits that are difficult to quantify include enhanced market integration through \nPRI development, and associated investments in technical extension services and strengthened \nFPGs. Through supply contracts with private traders, farmers will gain access to agricultural \ninputs,  credit,  and  downstream  production  services.  The  market  risk  is  reduced  since  the \ncontracts  typically  indicate  the  prices  and  contracted  quantities  in  advance.  This  potential \nsource of benefit is omitted in the analysis since the terms of the contracts are not yet specified. \n \n22.  The average household farm size in the subproject areas is 0.9 ha in Nam Beng and 1.0 \nha in Nam Oun. Based on local prices, yields, cropping intensities and patterns, the economic \nvalue  of  the  annual  agricultural  incomes  is  computed  for  both  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios. The difference represents the incremental project benefit that accrues to the farmers, \nand is compared with the project costs. On an incremental basis, the estimated EIRR is 18.6% \nin Nam Beng and 17.0% in Nam Oun; both are above the 12.0% economic opportunity cost of \ncapital.19 Sensitivity analyses show that the representative subprojects are most sensitive to a \ndecrease in benefits, but the EIRRs remain above the economic opportunity cost of capital. \n \n23.  The financial analysis indicates that irrigated and diversified farming will generate a high \nfinancial rate of return. The average farm should be able to generate a net incremental crop \nincome of KN4.3 million in Nam Beng (267% increase) and KN4.9 million in Nam Oun (328% \nincrease) as a result of completing the representative subprojects.20 This provides a strong \nincentive for farmers to adopt high-yielding technologies and collectively contribute labor and \nmonetary inputs for the routine operation and maintenance of the subprojects. Meeting recurrent \nO&M costs continues to be a challenge for the government, so the input of WUGs to O&M will \nremain essential. \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  The financial management assessment indicates that, with the capacity established and \nwith the support of the implementation consultants, MAF is capable of continuing the financial \nmanagement of the overall project.21 The NPMO will ensure the consolidated project financial \nstatements  are  audited  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with \ninternational auditing standards and the government\u2019s audit regulations. MAF will submit the \naudited project financial statements in English to ADB within 6 months after the end of the fiscal \nyear. The project will continue operating a website for disclosure of implementation progress, \nbid notifications and results, and a grievance mechanism for corrupt practices and for people \nwho may be negatively affected by the project. \n \n25.  MAF has extensive experience and capacity for managing externally funded projects, \nincluding those of ADB. All procurement and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the \nADB grant will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and \n                                                \n19 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Without the project, annual income is about KN1.6 million in Nam Beng and KN1.5 million in Nam Oun. With the \nproject, annual income is estimated at KN5.9 million in Nam Beng and KN6.4 million in Nam Oun. \n21 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The government\u2019s \npublic  procurement  legislation  and  regulations  (as  acceptable  to  ADB)  will  be  applied  for \npackages procured using national competitive bidding and shopping procedures. PPOs will \ninvolve district and lower administrative units, and communities to ensure their participation in \nmonitoring PRI subproject design and construction.  \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MAF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM and will be posted on the project website.22 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The average poverty rate in northern rural Lao PDR is 26%, down from 31% in 2008.23 \nRural poverty is close to three times as prevalent as urban poverty. Many of the PRI subprojects \nare in areas where a significant number of beneficiaries are members of ethnic groups. Poverty \nis highest among the non-Lao and non-Thai ethnic groups\u201435% among the Hmong-Lu Mien, \n34% among the Mon-Khmer, and 32% among the Chine-Tibet. These three ethnic groups \ncomprise over 73% of the population of the project\u2019s four provinces. Food insecurity rates vary, \nreaching  22%  in  rural  households  classified  as  having  poor  or  borderline  levels  of  food \nconsumption. The health, nutrition, and literacy indicators of people living in remote areas are \nalso significantly lower than national averages, particularly for ethnic women. \n \n28.  PRI investments have been improving the incomes and food security of beneficiary \nhouseholds.  The  associated  initiatives  provide  opportunities  for  rural  people  to  build  their \ncapacities to derive improved agriculture-based livelihoods. The project will provide resources \nfor  implementing  subproject  gender  action  plans  and  ethnic  group  development  plans.  As \nwomen are greatly underrepresented in village and community decision-making institutions, \ninterventions will increase their involvement in WUGs and FPGs. Vulnerable groups, mainly \nethnic  groups  and  households  headed  by  women,  will  receive  preferential  employment \nopportunities for construction activities. The improved PRI will intensify agricultural activity and \nincrease demand for labor and services, leading to income-generating opportunities. No major \nnegative social impacts have occurred during implementation of the current project.  \n \n29.  Gender  (effective  gender  mainstreaming).  The  poverty,  social,  and  gender  due \ndiligence conducted for the current project remains valid; and confirms the effective gender \nmainstreaming classification for the overall project. The gender action plan has been updated \nbased  on  (i) equitable  project  benefits  and  opportunity  sharing  between  men  and  women; \n(ii) gender-sensitive approaches to reduce gender inequalities in the project areas; (iii) targeted \napproaches  for  training  women,  including  those  in  ethnic  groups;  (iv)  collection  of  sex-\ndisaggregated data for benefit monitoring and evaluation; and (v) increased representation of \nwomen in decision-making bodies.24 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The resettlement framework was updated and \nagreed with the government in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).25 \nResettlement and land acquisition impacts are limited since the subprojects will rehabilitate \n                                                \n22 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nexisting infrastructure, and prescreening ensured that none of the subprojects would entail \nsignificant resettlement or land acquisition.26 Resettlement plans will be prepared for minor \ncompensation that may be needed, in accordance with the resettlement framework. \n \n31.  Environment  (category  B).  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \nagreed by the government and ADB was updated based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and resources for its implementation have been allocated.27 Subproject prescreening has \neliminated subprojects with significant negative environmental impacts. Minor impacts will be \nmitigated by implementing the subproject environmental management plans prepared as part of \neach  initial  environmental  examination.  Subproject feasibility  studies  will  ensure  that  water \nofftake during the dry season allows sufficient flows to maintain the riparian ecosystem and \nadequate resources for downstream users. Irrigation weirs may hamper aquatic life migration \nand stress fish stocks. Aquatic life passages will be made a standard weir design feature. The \nintensification of agriculture will bring long-term benefits to farmers but may also increase the \nuse of agrochemicals. The environmental management plans will address risks associated with \nthe  use  of  agrochemicals  and  the  promotion  of  sustainable  land-use  practices,  through \nawareness  raising  and  training.  Supporting  WUG  and  FPG  members  in  obtaining  land \nownership certificates is expected to catalyze good land and watershed stewardship. \n \n32.  Indigenous  Peoples  (category  B).  The  Indigenous  Peoples  Planning  Framework: \nEthnic Groups Development Framework28agreed by the government and ADB was updated, \nand resources were allocated to prepare ethnic group development plans for potential category \nB  subprojects  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).29 The  overall  project \nactivities will not cause (i) involuntary changes in ethnic groups\u2019 livelihood systems, cultural \npractices, ancestral domains, food production practices, or cultural cohesion;  (ii) unwanted \ndependence on external market forces; or (iii) the exclusion of any ethnic group.  Possible \nnegative impacts will be avoided when possible or will be compensated. Impacts are expected \nto be overwhelmingly positive since activities are for the socioeconomic improvement of the total \npopulation.  All  data  collected  will  be  disaggregated  by  ethno-linguistic  group,  age  (where \nappropriate), and gender to allow the monitoring and evaluation of beneficiary inclusion. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPublic financial management:  Training has enabled the project accounting unit to develop sufficient capacity \nweak regulatory systems and  within the NPMO and the implementing agencies. The GIC will provide support as \nskills; inadequate financing of  needed. Any financial staff changes will be agreed with ADB. WUGs are effectively \nO&M  carrying out O&M independent of public financing. \n                                                \n26 Based on feasibility studies of representative subprojects and initial prescreening, the total cost of land acquisition \nand resettlement is estimated to be $268,000, or 2% of civil works costs. \n27 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Hmong, Khmou, and Lao are the major indigenous peoples in the project area; and fall under the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) description of indigenous peoples. The government refers to indigenous peoples as \n\u201cethnic groups\u201d (Government of the Lao PDR. 2003. Constitution of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nVientiane [article 8]). \n29 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework: Ethnic Groups Development Framework (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n30 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProcurement: weak regulatory  The trained NPMO procurement staff will be supported by the GIC, and any staff \nsystems and staff skills  changes will be agreed with ADB. ADB will provide prior review for consulting \nrecruitment and NCB contracts according to the procurement plan. \nCorruption: high perceived  Project accounts will be closely monitored by the resident mission with twice annual \nlevels  reviews. Mechanisms for reporting corruption are in place. ADB will build \nstakeholder awareness of its Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date). \nEnvironmental sustainability  The Project will: (i) build capacity and raise awareness of potential climate impacts \nand climate change: increasing  and introduce farming methods and appropriate crop varieties; (ii) support land \nstress on water and land  tenure and watershed management; (iii) construct climate resilient PRI to enable \necosystems  farmers to better manage water resources; and (iv) carry out an irrigation subsector \nreview to strengthen sector planning, investment and implementation. \nGlobal: vulnerable to external  Strong demand for food is forecast. The capacity of WUGs and FPGs will be \nshocks and price fluctuations  improved to diversify and commercialize production. The project will closely monitor \nthe establishment of FPG supply contracts, land-use maps, and land registration \nwhich will contribute to achieving production targets. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  FPG  =  farmer  producer  group,  GIC = grant  implementation  consultant \nNCB = national  competitive  bidding,  NPMO  =  national  project  management  office,  O&M  =  operation  and \nmaintenance, PRI = productive rural infrastructure, WUG = water user group. \nSources: Asian Development Bank. \n \n34.  With  the  mitigation  measures  to  be  put  in  place,  the  overall  risk  assessment  is \nconsidered low, and the benefits and impacts of the project will far outweigh the estimated \ncosts. This is demonstrated in the sensitivity analyses in the economic and financial analysis. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n35.  The government and MAF have assured ADB that implementation of the overall project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and grant agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding $35.6 million to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources  (Asian  Development  Fund),  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Northern  Rural \nInfrastructure Development Sector Project, on terms and conditions that are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n                  Takehiko Nakao \n                  President \n \n \n28 April 2017\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n  Impact the Project is Aligned with: \nCurrent project: Improved rural household incomes in the four northern provinces of Bokeo, Louang-\nNamtha, Oudomxai, and Phongsali \nOverall project: Unchanged and is aligned with Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry\u2019s (MAF) Agricultural \nDevelopment Strategy to 2025 and Vision to the year 2030 \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome    Key commercial crop  Climate change \nCurrent project  Current project  production statistical  impacts adversely \nreports by provincial and  affect crop \nIncreased  Agriculture productivity in rice \ndistrict agriculture and  production and \nagricultural  equivalent increased from \nforestry offices  commercialization. \nproductivity in the  3 tons/ha in 2010 to 5 tons/ha \nfour northern  by 2017 \nprovinces of Bokeo,   \nLouang-Namtha,  Overall project \nOudomxai, and  Agriculture productivity in rice \nPhongsali  equivalent increased from \n  3 tons/ha in 2010 to 5 tons/ha \nOverall project \nby 2022 \nUnchanged \nOutputs       \nOutput 1  1a.  1a\u2013c.
