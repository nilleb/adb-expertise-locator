The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is necessary to define the scope of \nthe project and ensure project\u2019s early startup. The objectives of the PPTA are to: (i) design a \nproject suitable for Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing by identifying appropriate project \ncomponents and financial modalities to achieve the desired project impact; (ii) design the project \nin potential collaboration with Japan International Cooperation Agency and other donors to \nleverage its effectiveness and impact; (iii) conduct detailed assessment of technical, economic, \nfinancial, procurement and governance, safeguards, poverty reduction, social inclusion and \ngender mainstreaming; (iv) provide trainings to the executing and implementing agencies and \nactivities with civil society organizations; (v) conduct stakeholder analysis and consultations to \nachieve project outcomes; and (vi) complete preliminary and detailed engineering designs for \nkey components based on the feasibility study reports to ensure early startup of the project.  \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The PPTA will have two phases of activities and collectively produce the outputs and \nactivities in Table A3.1. The first phase will cover a detailed assessment of the technical, \nfinancial, economic, safeguards, social and institutional aspects for the project. The second \nphase will cover a preliminary and detailed engineering design of the key components.1 \nTable A3.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nMajor Activities  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Completion Date \nProject design and due diligence \nSafeguards, social development   1 January 2018  Inception report  1 May 2017 \nand project administration    Interim report  1 October 2017 \norientation trainings    Draft project EIA, resettlement plans,  1 March 2018 \nSludge management training  1 March 2018  FMA, GAP, MBDs, P-RAMP,   \nPublic-private partnership training  1 October 2017  SCSPP, SDAP, and Final report  31 August 2018 \nPreliminary and detailed engineering design \n   Preliminary engineering design report  31 December 2018 \nDetailed engineering design drawing   30 June 2019 \nBidding documents, Final project  30 September 2019 \nEIA, Final resettlement plans  \nEIA = environmental impact assessment, FMA = financial management assessment, GAP = gender action plan, \nMBDs = master bidding documents, P-RAMP = project procurement risk assessment and management plan, \nSCSPP = stakeholder communication strategy and participation plan, SDAP = social development action plan.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nC.
