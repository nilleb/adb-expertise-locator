The Asian Environment Outlook 2001 (AEO) 20011 was the first in a series of reports \nthat are to provide periodic review of environmental and developmental policies, tools, and \nopportunities  of  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  The  series  aims  to  help  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to help DMCs achieve their stated environmental objectives.\u201d2 The \naudience  of  AEO  2001  was  seen  as  \u201cDMC  government  decision  makers,  planners,  and \nenvironmental executives and specialists from international assistance agencies\u201d who were \nexpected to use the report in formulating environmentally sound development policies and \nprograms. AEO 2001 focused mainly on policy integration, noting that command and control \napproaches needed to be matched with market-based instruments and other policies needed to \nbe mainstreamed into all levels of economic development planning.  \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) completion report for AEO 2001 found that the final report \nprovided \u201ca firm basis for mainstreaming environment into the development agenda.\u201d3 The \nreport had global media coverage and the original print run of 1,000 copies had to be tripled to \n3,000 to meet continued demand for the document.  Background papers covering economic, \ninstitutional, and governance aspects as well as country environmental policy integration studies \nfor Peoples Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and \nViet Nam, were published separately.  \n \n3.  AEO 2001 was a companion document to the Global Environment Outlook of the United \nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the State of Environment (SOE) report of the  \nUnited  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (ESCAP),  both \npublished in 2000. The SOE reports have been prepared every 5 years since 1985. In 2005, \nESCAP will release its next SOE report as a major input to the fifth Ministerial Conference on \nEnvironment and Development, to be held in the Republic of Korea.  During the Fact-Finding \nMission for this regional TA in May 2004, ADB was requested, as a traditional partner in the \nSOE process, to help prepare the SOE report and the ministerial conference.4  AEO 2005 is \nagain being viewed as a complementary, companion document to the SOE and a major policy \ninput to the ministerial conference.  As in the previous ministerial conference, ESCAP has also \nasked ADB to help prepare and sponsor of a private sector forum, as a side event. The TA \nframework is at Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \n4.  At the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, a key \nreport on national implementation of Agenda 215 documented progress since the United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.  For the Asia-Pacific \nregion, about half of the 44 nations reported that they had substantially implemented parts of \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance for Preparation of Asian Environment Outlook.  Manila.  \n2 The Asian Environment Outlook was intended to \u201cbecome a triennial ADB publication in the future.\u201d While the \nobjectives remain constant, lack of funds for interregional knowledge products and services in ADB has prevented \nthe publication of a regular series on a triennial basis.  \n3 ADB. 2002.

National Implementation of Agenda 21: A \nReport. New York.  ", "2  \nAgenda 21.  The overall impression of the section of the report on the Asia-Pacific region was \nthat  more  participatory  approaches  involving  key  stakeholders  and  better  integration  with \neconomic incentives are needed.  \n \n5.  Implementation  at  the  regional  and  subregional  levels  is  a  key  requirement  of  the \nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI).  Following the JPOI, ESCAP produced its own \naction plan for regional follow up.6 The subregional initiatives in this action plan are based on \nplanned or ongoing activities with indications of assured financial and technical support from \nmajor partners. The subregional initiatives7 suggested in the publication are as follows: \n \n(i)  Central Asia: (a) Regional Environmental Action Plan for Central Asia, and (b) \nintegrated water resources management; \n(ii)  North-East  Asia:  (a)  cleaner  production;  (b)  transboundary  air  pollution, \nincluding abatement of dust storms; and (c) desertification and land degradation; \n(iii)  South  Asia:  (a)  poverty  reduction  and  food  security,  (b)  natural  disaster \nmitigation, and (c) public awareness and participation; \n(iv)  South-East Asia: (a) sustainable development of urban areas, (b) globalization \nand its impacts, and (c) Strategic Environment Framework for Greater Mekong \nSubregion; and \n(v)  South Pacific: (a) Pacific Regional Environment Strategy, and (b) protection and \nmanagement of coastal and marine ecosystems.  \n \n6.  In addition to the political declaration and the JPOI, the third major outcome of the \nWSSD was the innovation of partnerships, especially the so-called \u201cType II partnerships.\u201d  Type \nII partnerships for sustainable development are defined as specific commitments by various \npartners (between governments of the north and the south and between governments and \nmajor groups) intended to contribute to and reinforce the implementation of the outcomes of the \nintergovernmental negotiations of the WSSD in achieving further implementation of Agenda 21 \nand the Millennium Development Goals.  As of April 2004, 266 partnerships were registered \nwith the Commission on Sustainable Development.  More than half of the partnerships are \nglobal in scope. Most of the rest are regional or subregional, and over 50 partnerships have \nbeen registered for the Asia-Pacific region.  Of the partnerships that did not predate the WSSD, \nmost are still setting up or are looking for funding.  \n \n7.  Among these partnerships, some of the more promising fall into the category of public-\nprivate partnerships, where the private sector has indicated its commitment to the principles of \nsustainable development.  In part, this is a reaction to the antiglobalization forces, most visibly \nand  violently  arrayed  against  the  World  Trade  Organization  in  Seattle  in  1999,  consumer \npressure,  and  evolving  legislation.    But  in  larger  measure  it  is  a  growing  recognition  that \nattention to environmental and social issues, in addition to the primary focus on profit, is actually \ngood for business. A survey of more than 1,000 chief executives in 33 countries found that 79% \nof respondents agreed that \u201csustainability is vital to the profitability of any company.\u201d8  Globally, \nsocially responsible investment (SRI) funds have attracted $2.7 trillion in assets, and have \nperformed well even in periods of economic downturn, but less than $1 billion of SRI is invested \nin Asia, a negligible fraction of total market capital.  By fostering the basic investment climate \n                                                 \n6 ESCAP. 2003.

", "  3\nand corporate governance demanded by SRI funds, ADB could help to generate more foreign \ndirect investment in Asia than that provided by official development assistance.  \n \n8.  While many business leaders still believe that the business of business is \u201cbusiness,\u201d \nwith its only objective maximizing profit, hundreds of the world\u2019s largest companies routinely \naddress the so-called \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d of social, environmental, and economic objectives.  \nWhile  the  motivation  of  such  corporations  ranges  from  genuine  commitment  by  the  chief \nexecutives to an elaborate public relations ploy, the more progressive firms are clearly setting \nthe baseline for others to follow. In fact, several countries (Denmark, France, Netherlands, \nNorway,  and  Sweden)  have  made  sustainability  reporting  mandatory,  and  others  can  be \nexpected to follow suit.   \n \n9.  At the World Economic Forum on 31 January 1999, the Global Compact was proposed, \nby the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, as a voluntary initiative. The Global Compact is \nintended to bring companies together with UN agencies, labor, and civil society to contribute for \nthe development of a sustainable and comprehensive global market. The Global Compact\u2019s \noperational phase was launched at UN headquarters in New York on 26 July 2000. Hundreds of \ncompanies from all regions as well as civil society organizations are now engaged in the Global \nCompact. To join the initiative, companies are required to support nine principles in the areas of \nhuman rights, labor, and environment (a tenth principle on corruption is being added). The \nGlobal Compact is aiming at the creation of a cooperative relationship between companies and \ncivil society for the development of a sustainable global market, which will contribute to poverty \nalleviation.  \n \n10.  Pressure is also coming from the financial sector.  In June 2003, several of the world\u2019s \nlargest private financial institutions adopted the \u201cEquator Principles,\u201d which seek to ensure that \nthe projects they finance (over $50 million capital cost) are developed in a manner that is \nsocially responsible and reflects sound environmental management practices. They will provide \nloans directly only where the borrower will and can comply with the espoused environmental \nand social policies and processes.  The Equator Principles commit the participating banks to \nessentially  follow  the  safeguard  policies  of  the  World  Bank  and  International  Finance \nCorporation, and comply with all local environmental policies, laws, and standards.  Currently \nmore than 20 of the world\u2019s largest banking groups have signed on to the Equator Principles.  \n \n11.  External pressure is not the only driving force causing the private sector to sign on to \nenvironmental objectives.  The environmental services industry is one of the fastest growing \nindustries in the world.  Renewable energy, cleaner production, life cycle analysis, hybrid cars, \nand technologies that clean up pollution are generating huge new opportunities for business.  \nAccess to the new technologies for industries in the Asia-Pacific region is seen as a major \nopportunity for economic growth prospects.  \n \n12.  With a few notable exceptions, firms in the Asia-Pacific region dominated by small and \nmedium enterprises, often family-owned or state-owned firms, have been slow to pick up on \nthese global trends.  ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Strategy aims to promote private-\nsector-led growth, help solve problems that impede private sector growth, and increase the \ncontribution of the private sector to poverty reduction. The three strategic thrusts (creating \nenabling conditions, generating business opportunities, and catalyzing private investments) will \nbe focused on governance, financial intermediation, public-private partnerships, and regional \nand subregional cooperation.  The strategy also indicates that ADB\u2019s initiatives on corporate \ngovernance should extend to promoting corporate responsibility to maximize the opportunity for ", "4  \ncompanies to integrate social and environmental awareness into core business practices and \nmake private investment sustainable.  \n \n13.  By documenting the growing pressures on the Asia-Pacific corporate sector, as well as \nthe sound business incentives, to pursue environmentally sound strategies, AEO 2005 can \nmake  the  case  for  all  DMCs  to  find  an  optimum  combination  of  command  and  control \napproaches,  market-based  instruments,  and  voluntary  agreements  with  industry  sectors. \nPreparation of the AEO 2005 and the proposed private sector forum at the 2005 Ministerial \nConference on Environment and Development will provide an ideal opportunity for ADB to take \na  lead  role  in  furthering  regional  and  subregional  interest  in  public-private  partnerships  to \nachieve sustainable development, as well as drawing attention to the need for governments to \ncreate  the  appropriate  enabling  conditions,  especially  for  SRI,  and  the  demand  for \nenvironmental business opportunities.9 \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Purpose and Outputs \n \n14.  The ultimate goal of the TA is to facilitate the development of new arrangements for the \nprivate  sector  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region  to  become  a  full  partner  in  achieving  sustainable \ndevelopment goals, negotiating programs to deliver the outputs specified in national strategies, \nimplementing those programs, and regularly reporting on progress. The purpose of the TA is to \ndocument and disseminate developed country experience with engaging the private sector in \nmeeting sustainable development goals and to make a strong case for firms in the Asia-Pacific \nregion  to  become  more  involved  in  setting  environmental  targets  in  partnership  with \ngovernments and routinely reporting on progress toward those targets.  \n \n15.   The primary output of the TA is an analytical report on the emerging global pressures and \nopportunities  for  firms  to  take  a  more  prominent  role  in  setting  environmental  targets, \nimplementing environmental management systems, and routinely reporting on progress towards \nenvironmental goals and targets.  A secondary output is extensive dissemination of the findings \nof the report, initiated by a major media launch.  \n \nB.   Methodology and Activities \n \n16.  The report will be a key input to a private sector forum to be held on the margins of the \nMinisterial Conference on Environment and Development in the Republic of Korea in March \n2005.  Preparation of the report will also be used as a means to engage with the World \nBusiness Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), assisting it to expand its activities \nthroughout the Asia-Pacific region.  \n \n17.  The report will be prepared by a selected group of international experts, assisted by the \nenvironment network staff in ADB. The team will liaise closely with other international agencies \n(ESCAP, UNEP, United Nations Development Program, World Bank, etc.), global business \nassociations (Association of Chartered and Certified Accountants, International Chamber of \nCommerce,  WBCSD,  etc.),  and  regional  business  associations  (such  as  the  Hong  Kong \n                                                 \n9  In  preparing  this  TA  paper,  ADB  has  consulted  widely  with  the  World  Business  Council  for  Sustainable \nDevelopment  (WBCSD),  Asian-Pacific  chapters  of  WBCSD,  private  sector  specialists,  Regional  Institute  for \nEnvironmental Technology, other multilateral agencies, and other stakeholders.  ", "  5\nBusiness Council for Sustainable Development) for access to information and for peer review of \ndrafts  of  the  report.  Two  workshops,  facilitated  by  a  global  and  one  by  Asian  business \nassociations, will provide feedback on private sector concerns that need to be addressed in the \nreport.    A  domestic  consultant  will  be  recruited  for  6  person-months  to  assist  with  data \ncollection, communication strategy and editorial assistance.  As the SOE 2005 report is seen as \na  companion  document,  the  TA  will  also  provide  for  ADB  assistance  in  drafting  relevant \nsections.  \n \n18.  The TA will launch the principal findings of the analysis at a private sector forum, which \nwill be a side event of the Ministerial Conference (Appendix 2). The TA will also provide for \nresource persons, including ADB staff, to participate in the two workshops and the private sector \nforum sponsored by ADB, as well as in expert drafting sessions for the SOE report.  \n \nC.   Cost Estimates and Financing  \n \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000.  ADB will provide the entire amount on \na grant basis, with $40,000 provided to ESCAP as a contribution to the private sector forum to \nbe  held  as  a  side  event  to  the  forthcoming  Ministerial  Conference  on  Environment  and \nDevelopment.    ADB  will  authorize  the  release  of  its  funds  to  ESCAP  for  the  Ministerial \nConference upon receipt of sufficient documentation to justify the need and the application of \nthe funds. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program.  Details of \nthe cost estimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  As the Executing Agency, ADB will recruit three international consultants (private sector \nspecialist,  3  person-months;  emerging  technologies  specialist,  3  person-months;  and \nenvironment specialist, 3 person-months) for a total of 9 person-months and one domestic \nconsultant (environment/communication specialist, 6 person-months) on an individual basis in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  ADB  will  also  provide  resource \npersons, including the TA team leader, for the workshops and private sector forum to be funded \nby the TA.  Outline terms of reference are included in Appendix 4. The TA is expected to \ncommence in July 2004 and be completed by April 2005. ADB may arrange with the WBCSD \nand a similar business association in the region to host the two workshops, one to be held in \nEurope, the other in Asia in October/November 2004.  ESCAP, in consultation with ADB, will be \nresponsible for organizing the private sector forum to be held in conjunction with the Ministerial \nConference on Environment and Development in March 2005.  \n \nIV.
