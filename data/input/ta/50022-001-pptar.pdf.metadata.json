The TA is estimated to cost $750,000 equivalent, of which $700,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The \ngovernment will provide $50,000 in-kind counterpart support.

Consulting Services  \n \n4.  The TA is anticipated to require 15.5 person-months (p-m) of international and 20 p-m of \nnational consulting services for a total of 13 consultants (see Supplementary Appendix 1) to be \nengaged using individual consultant selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Individual consultants are being hired in \nview of the short processing lead time for program preparation and the consequent short \nduration of the TA. Advance contracting will be used to recruit the TA consultants who will be \nengaged under an output-based (lump-sum) contract wherever possible. To save on transaction \ncosts, single source selection method may be used to hire consultants for shorter assignments. \nDepending on actual project needs, engagement of resource persons may be required and will \ncomply with ADB rules. The consultants will report to ADB and the key implementing agencies \nof  the  government  on  the  substance  and  timing  of  deliveries.  Key  findings  and \nrecommendations of the TA will be discussed in final workshops and a national workshop. \n \n5.  For a short survey assignment, the Institute for Social Researches under the Cabinet of \nMinisters (the Institute) is proposed to be hired on a single source basis. This government- \nowned Institute is considered suitable for conducting the demand analysis for rural housing \ngiven its mandate to conduct social research and its access to sensitive social and income data. \nThe Institute was hired by ADB in the past for social research including an assessment of \npoverty and income levels. The Institute is expected to complete the assignment on a lump-sum \nbasis for around $50,000.
