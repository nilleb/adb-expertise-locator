These are:  \n  \nKerala, India \n1.  Sterilized whole/ground spice plant \n2.  Seasonings plant \n3.  Nutraceuticals plant expansion \nBattambang, Cambodia \n4.  Asothe Model Farm and contract farming \n5.  Spice extraction plant \n \nProject reach: \nThe project will contribute to a reduction in rural poverty in India and Cambodia by including farmers \nin formal agriculture value chains. The project activities aim to increase production of high-value \nspice products with raw produce to be sourced from an expanded contract-farmer network in India \nand Cambodia. In India, the project reach is expected to increase from 280 in FY2014 to at least 540 \nnon-farm jobs in FY2018. The number of farmers working under contract farming will increase from \n3,000 in FY2014 to 6,000 in FY2018. In addition, at least 5000 non-contract farmers are expected to \nbe impacted by Akay\u2019s open market procurement policy for spices by 2018. In Cambodia, Akay\u2019s \nfarm employees will increase from 30 in FY2014 to at least 80 in FY2018 and the farmers working \nunder contract farming will increase from zero in 2013 to 2,000 in FY2018, and to an estimated \n10,000 in the long-term beyond FY2018.  \n \nTable 1.Project reach numbers for Akay\u2019s expansion plans in India and Cambodia1  \n  FY2014  FY2018  Post-FY2018 (estimated) \nIndia:       \nContract-farmers  3,000  6,000   \nNon-farm jobs  280  540   \nNon-contract farmers    50002   \nCambodia:       \nContract-farmers  0  2,000  10,000 \nhouseholds \nFarm Employees  30  80   \n                                                           \n1 Akay\u2019s contract farmer reach numbers are derived from total expected farmer households contracted by \nAkay. The average household size of farmers was assumed to be 2 (one man one woman). 1500 farmer \nhouseholds are currently contracted by Akay in India, which is expected to double to 3000 households by \n2018. This gives us total contract-farmer reach in India to be 3000 in FY14\u2019 and 6000 in FY18. Similarly in \nCambodia, 1000 farming households are expected to be contracted by Akay by FY18\u2019, which gives a total \ncontract farmer reach number of 2,000 farmers.  \n2 Result of Akay\u2019s plans for open-market procurement policy for its new spice extraction plants \n2 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \nSeasonal farm workers  200  400   \n \nExpected depth of intervention3:  \n \nTo calculate the depth of impact on project beneficiaries, this study classified the survey population \nunder three international poverty lines of <USD1.25, <USD2, and <USD3. Under constraints of \nunavailability of precise poverty line data for respondents, international lines were adjusted to the \nbottom range of the actual range of income used in the survey questionnaire, to arrive at a safe \nestimate close to international poverty lines (see table 2) for India and Cambodia. In the absence of \nthis classification for the entire population under project reach, respondents from the surveys \nconducted in India and Cambodia were divided under survey poverty lines. For respondents in India \nand Cambodia, the survey asked for total monthly household incomes within pre-set ranges. We \ndivided the lower-limit of these ranges by the average number of income earners per household, \nand by 30 (days), to arrive at average household incomes/person/day for each respondent. The \nsmaller sample of 51 women in India were asked separately to report on their individual monthly \nincomes, which was similarly divided to income per day. \n \nIn India, the poverty situation of farmers under Akay\u2019s contract is noticeably different in Karnataka \nand Andhra Pradesh. Only 3% of farmers in Karnataka, who have been with Akay for an average of \n10 years, are still under the approximated extreme poverty line of USD1.55/day, 31% earn less than \nUSD2.33/day,  and 56%  earn  less  than  USD3.1/day.  Approximately  44% of contract-farmers in \nKarnataka are above the USD3/day poverty line. In Andhra Pradesh, after a short 1 year average \nengagement with Akay, 69% of farmers are under the approximated extreme poverty line, 87% \nunder USD2.33/day line, and 98% under USD3.1/day line. A majority of contract-farmers in Andhra \nPradesh are therefore extremely poor, and almost all of them are in a poverty situation.  \n \nIn Cambodia, 27% of prospective farmers currently fall under the approximated extreme poverty line \nof USD1.3/day, 48% under USD 1.96/day, and 76% under USD3.26/day. 76% of survey respondents \nwho are poor  by  cumulative standards, and 27% who are extremely  poor, present  Akay the \nopportunity to uplift them from poverty by enabling them to earn higher farm revenues and stabilize \nthe receipt of higher household incomes. This poverty alleviation is demonstrated through the \npermanent employees and season farm workers already employed by Akay on its model farm in \nAsothe in Battambang province in Cambodia, all of who earn daily incomes higher than USD~2/day. \nOnly 4% of permanent employees, or 12 people, earned incomes lower than USD3.26/day.    \n \n \n                                                           \n3 There are 3 important notes on the methodology employed here:     \n \n1.  Average poverty lines used from the survey are only rough estimates because of use of lower ranges, \ninstead of the medians, because false positives were considered safer for project purposes than false \nnegatives (by roughly overestimating the number of poor people, instead of underestimating them) \n2.  The classification was only conducted for total survey population, which has been reported in the table, \nand serves as a rough estimate for the overall project. The data for total project beneficiaries is not yet \navailable. \n3.  Data on women farmer\u2019s incomes beyond the N=51 women\u2019s survey conducted in India is lacking, but we \nassume the 51 women are representative of other women farmers in India because of random sampling. \nIn addition, our survey asked for total household incomes, which included the incomes of wives of farmers \nin India and Cambodia engaged in farming. This means that the 43% of prospective farmers, 12% of \npermanent employees, and 70% of seasonal farm workers in Cambodia who are estimated to be women, \nhave also been averaged in to the overall income classification in the table.   \n \n3 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \n \nTable 2.

SUMMARY OF METHODOLOGY \n \nThis ex-ante Poverty Impact Assessment focuses on Akay\u2019s expansion plans in India and Cambodia, \nwith specific attention to the impact of the proposed outgrower model it plans to adopt in \nCambodia. This review has been conducted as a short evaluation, and assesses the following criteria: \n \n1.  The relevance of this project on people\u2019s income \n2.  Reach: number of people directly benefitting from the project, and their socioeconomic status \nbefore (year 0), in between (years 1 and 3) and after (year 6) the project \n3.  Depth: income increase, what are people doing with the additional money; how does it affect \ntheir poverty situation \n4.  Systemic impact of the project \n5.  Impact of project on women farmers and workers \n6.  Gender Action Plan to increase strategically increase gender impact \n \nOur  ex-ante  assessment  of  Akay\u2019s  planned  contract-farming  model  in  Battambang  province, \nCambodia,  was  supported  by  an  ex-post  assessment  of  Akay\u2019s  existing  contract-farming \narrangements in the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in India. Akay\u2019s ongoing contracts in \nthe two states present a good opportunity to review the existing impact of contract-farming, results \nfrom which are used to predict the impact of contract-farming in Samlot district, Battambang, \nCambodia. In addition, Akay has been engaged with farmers in Karnataka for an average of 10 \nyears, and with farmers in Andhra Pradesh for an average of 1 year, which presents a natural \nlongitudinal study to see the time-effects of contract-farming with Akay. We also used a control \ngroup of farmers in both states \u2013 those who haven\u2019t been contracted by Akay \u2013 as a counterfactual \nto  contract-farming  to  extricate  causal  links  between  farmer  socioeconomic  conditions  and \nengagement with Akay.   \n \nAnswers for the investigation have been generated through a combination of desk research, field \ninterviews and surveys. The field surveys in India and Cambodia form the core of our approach, \ndriving insights on the future impact of this project: \n\u2022  Field survey \nRespondents were surveyed on a range of key financial and socio-economic indicators to assess \nthe various routes to impact for prospective contract farmers \n(cid:1)  India survey \nthe sample consists of 180 households of contract farmers (corresponding to a 95% \nconfidence level and 7% error margin) with a control group of another 178 households \nto get insights on 1,500 contract farmers4. The location consists of 2 districts in \nKarnataka and 2 districts in Andhra Pradesh. Alongside, a sample of 50 women (wives of \nthe contract farmers) were interviewed separately through an add-on questionnaire to \nprovide an additional perspective to the gender impact of the project. \n(cid:1)  Cambodia survey \nthe survey in Cambodia include permanent employees, seasonal workers, and \nprospective contract farmers. The sample consists of 30 permanent employees (100%), \nseasonal workers (20, 10% of the 200 workers) and 200 households of prospective \ncontract farmers (corresponding to a 95% confidence level and 7% error margin) for a \nmid-term size of 5,000 households. \n\u2022  A review of company documentation to understand and evaluate Akay\u2019s planned route to \nimpact within its sphere of influence \n                                                           \n4 While the original sample size was 175 households of contract farmers and 175 households as control group, \n5 contract farmers and 4 control group farmers from the pilot survey were also included for analysis \n5 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \n\u2022  Review of secondary literature on organic farming, crop diversification and financial inclusion in \nrural areas in low-income countries.  \n \nFor the purpose of the Gender Impact Assessment, we surveyed a sample of 51 women (26 in \nAndhra Pradesh, 25 in Karnataka)5, in addition to the survey of 180 male chilly farmers, to gauge the \ncondition  of  women  on  important  socioeconomic  indicators.  These  women  were  surveyed \nindependently from men and their households to provide them with an environment where they \ncould respond without being influenced by dominant members of their household. At the same \ntime, our survey of male chilly farmers had a number of questions to assess gender impact from \ntheir point of view too. Overall, 86% (155) of 180 men surveyed had wives working on an Akay \ncontract farm. The two sets of responses should provide a good indicator of the overall conditions of \nwomen under contract and/or employ of Akay in India. \n \nTable 3.

However, their responses are still indicative of the general conditions \nwitnessed by women in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh under Akay contracts, and can be used to draw \nreasonable conclusions about gender impacts in the two states.  \n6 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \nOur mixed-method approach that combined ex-post and ex-ante analysis of Akay\u2019s contract-farming \nactivities to understand impact is illustrated in the figure below:   \n \nFigure 1.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS \n \n1.  Poverty impact in India and Cambodia:  \n \na.  Revenue of farmers in India \nAkay  contract  farmers  in  both  Karnataka  and  Andhra  Pradesh  reported  earning  a  higher \nrevenue/acre of chilly grown than their non-contract farming counterparts. Overall, Akay contract \nfarmers earned 10% higher revenues than the control group. This effect is smaller in Karnataka due \nto  strong  control  group  baselines6.  In  Andhra  Pradesh,  for  example,  two  important  factors \ncontributed to higher revenues/acre for farmers. Akay farmers received a selling price of Rs. \n6,577.22 per quintal of chilly grown, 14.3% higher than the selling price received by non-Akay \nfarmers (Rs. 5,754.0). Akay farmers also saw a small increase of 2.38% in yields/acre of chilly grown \ncompared to non-Akay farmers. This resulted in both higher yields of chilly per acre of chilly planted, \nand higher prices per quintal of chilly output leading to a 17% increase in average revenue/acre of \nchilly  grown  over  control  group  farmers.  In  Karnataka  there was  a  smaller  gain  of  1.16%  in \nyields/acre of chilly grown and 2.86% in selling prices for Akay farmers, over the control-group, \nresulting in an overall 4% increase in revenue/acre of chilly grown by Akay farmers.  \nThe differences between Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are in both average yields of chilly, and in \nselling prices received from Akay. Karnataka farmers, for example, reported receiving a selling price \nof Rs. 7,532.6 per quintal of chilly, whereas farmers in Andhra Pradesh received Rs. 6,577.22, 12.6% \nless than Karnataka farmers. This disparity informed the recommendation for Akay to review its \ncontract-terms in the two states in order to bring parity in prices and revenues earned by contract-\nfarmers here. It is also worth noting here that farmers in both states saw expansion in average size \nof landholding, and thus increases in total yield, but their yields/acre remained close to the control-\ngroup farmers, leading to the conclusion that the organic farming methods, though beneficial for the \nenvironment, and health of farmers, has not lead to a significant increase in average yields in India.  \n \nb.  Household incomes in India \nAkay contract-farmers reported earning significant increases in average monthly household incomes \nsince joining Akay\u2019s contract-farming model. Overall, Akay\u2019s contract-farmer\u2019s households have \nearned 50% higher monthly incomes since joining Akay. Akay farmers in Karnataka saw their \nhousehold income rise by 75% since joining Akay (10 years) (INR6,600 before Akay to 11,600 since \nAkay). Akay farmers in Andhra Pradesh saw household incomes increase by 16% from INR 4700 to \nINR 5400.  Compared to the control group, Akay farmers earned 15% more household income in \nAndhra Pradesh, but 14% less than the control group in Karnataka. This data demonstrates that Akay \nfarmers have benefited from significant household income increases since joining Akay. It also \nsuggests that income increases have impacted farmers in general in Karnataka, who now bring in \ngreater household incomes than Akay farmers. High household incomes of non-Akay farmers in \nKarnataka could be due to diversification of household incomes (through non-farm employment \nopportunities) and higher farm incomes due to widespread improvements in prices and market \naccess in the area (an effect that could be a positive externality of Akay farms).  \n \nc.  Wages of farm employees in Cambodia \nCurrent farm employees and seasonal farm workers on Akay\u2019s model farm in Asothe, Samlot District, \nBattambang Province, reported an average 108% and 71% respective increases in their monthly \nwages since working with Akay on its model farm. Farm employees and seasonal farm workers saw \n                                                           \n6 A large part of revenue increases would be due to increases in yield/acre of primary crop grown and in \nprocurement prices. Though farmers in Karnataka increased total acreage under cultivation, they did not see a \nsignificant gain in average yields/acre grown compared to control group farmers. This should be noted in light \nof introduction of organic farming systems v/s traditional farming methods found amongst the control group.  \n8 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \ntheir wages increase from KHR~410,000 to KHR ~854,000, or USD7211 (employees) KHR~348,000 to \nKHR~596,000, or USD147.47 (seasonal workers). Akay currently pays its farm employees a wage of \nUSD 5/day, or roughly USD 130 per working month (26 days). In comparison, the average minimum \nwage in Cambodia (2011), is USD61/month8. Even workers in the country\u2019s largest formal industry by \nemployment,  garments,  earned  an  average  of  USD65/month9,  significantly  lower  than  Akay\u2019s \nemployees in rural Cambodia. Akay farm employees and seasonal farm workers receive wages 245%, \nand 141% higher than the national minimum wage, respectively.  \nThis demonstrates strong positive income impacts under Akay\u2019s employment, and demonstrates the \nsignificant premium over minimum wage, and other formal economy benchmarks of low-semi skilled \nlabor, paid by Akay to its employees in Cambodia. High-wages paid in rural areas can stimulate the \nlocal economy by increasing per capita expenditures on essential goods and services, and also \nincentivize entrepreneurial activities if workers decide to invest incremental income in start-up \nbusinesses and small enterprises.  \n \nd.  Expected income of contract farmers in Cambodia \nAccording to projections of Akay\u2019s own model, annual incomes for contract farmers are expected to \nrise from USD 3,368 in 2015 to USD 11,318 in 2021, a CAGR of 27%. These incomes are projected to \ngo up from the sale of crops grown on the contract-farms. In the first two years of operation farmers \nwill earn revenue (USD 5,600/annum) from the sale of turmeric and coleus crop, whose seeds Akay \nwill provide free of cost for the duration of the project. From FY17 onwards,   farmers will also be \ngiven the first batch of black pepper seeds free of cost, from which they will earn an additional \n$4,200/annum, bringing total revenue up to $9,800/annum. Finally, in FY20, Akay will provide \nfarmers seeds and technical training to plant rubber trees, which will bring them $3,750/annum \nFY20 onwards. The farmer will have to incur the cost of labor, manure, composting, drip irrigation \n(pro-rate basis) and diesel for irrigation, amounting to $2,232.50/annum ($3,799.17 for FY17-19 for \ndrip irrigation). Eventually, farmers are expected to see their incomes rise from $3,367.50/annum in \nFY15\u2019,  to  $11,317  in  FY20.  This  expected  income  boost  will  come,  broadly,  because  of  crop \ndiversification, fixed procurement at premium prices, and technological interventions, the cost of \nwhich will be shared by the farmer and Akay.    \n \n2.  Gender Impacts: \n \na.  Stability of income in India \nWives of Akay\u2019s contract farmers surveyed in India (86% of who worked on contract-farms) had \ndifferent levels of income stability and changes in work conditions since working under Akay. 76% of \nwomen in Karnataka, and 31% in Andhra Pradesh, said they had stable incomes. 84% of women in \nKarnataka, versus 8% in Andhra Pradesh, reported improvements in work conditions under Akay\u2019s \ncontract. These results corroborate the results of contract-farming male farmers in the two states on \nthe income stability indicator, and the disparity between the two state groups of women could be \nexplained by the difference in average length of association with Akay, and by differences in \nimplementation of the contract-farming model.  \n \nb.  Control over earnings in India \n87% of male contract-farmers in Karnataka on behalf of their wives, and 80% of their wives, \nagreed that their control over their earnings had increased since contract-farming for Akay. In \n                                                           \n7 USD1 = 4041.47 KHR \n8 Perinelli, B., Alarm, VA (2011), Minimum Wage Compliance Report in Cambodia, Wage Indicator Report \nAugust 2011. Amsterdam, The Netherlands: Wage Indicator Foundation. \n9 Daily wage rate of USD2.71 X 24 (6 working days/week) = USD65. \n9 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \nAndhra Pradesh, 8% of men on behalf of their wives, and 4% of women themselves, said their \ncontrol over their own earnings had increased since contract-farming with Akay.  \n \nc.  Work conditions in India \n84% of women in Karnataka, versus 8% in Andhra Pradesh, reported improvements in work \nconditions under Akay\u2019s contract. The negligible improvement in work conditions in Andhra Pradesh, \nas reported by respondents, can be tied with the rest of the subdued effects of Akay\u2019s short-term (1 \nyear, on average) engagement with farmers in Andhra Pradesh, and is an important note in the \nreview of Akay\u2019s contract-farming model in India.   \n \nd.  Women\u2019s agency & financial inclusion in Cambodia \nOut of the 194 prospective contract farmers surveyed in Prey Thom Village, Battambang, Cambodia, \n83 (42.8%) were women. Of these, ~63% were primary income earners for their households, which \nmeans that any potential gender impact on them would have a direct impact on the condition of \ntheir households. For example, for every one woman of the 52 primary earners impacted, another \n~5 people (average household size in survey) in her home would feel effects of employment, income \nand social infrastructure changes. 92% of these women reported having somewhat-very unstable \nincomes at the current stage.

These \nsectors would have to be targeted in a strategic manner, using broader company policies to \nintervene in more specific causes of poverty and exclusion. We recommend 5 essential instruments \nto achieve impact in these categories which are illustrated in figure 2. The outcomes of these \ninstruments of intervention are expected to be:    \n \ni)  Greater financial inclusion of women in formal banking practices, resulting in development \nof savings behavior, savings for enterprise, and possible long-term household wealth \ngeneration \nii)  Greater information symmetry between Akay and contract-farmers, human capital \ndevelopment and infusion of technical know-how in local farming community, resulting in \nmore informed, capable and empowered farmers.  \niii)  Stable incomes for farmers which result in financial safety and improved planning for \nhousehold needs \niv)  Parity between contract-farming model in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, and extension of \nwork condition, income and stability benefits to aggrieved Andhra Pradesh farmers \n \nAkay  was  receptive  to  the  recommendations  laid  out  in  this  report.

CONTEXT \n \nADB, through its private sector department (PSOD) is considering investing up to USD 20 million in \nthe Indian spices company \u201cAkay\u201d to expand on farm spices production in India from Karnataka to \nKerala, and value chain off farm sourcing of organic spices in the Battambang province of Cambodia. \nThe project aims to help the company increase its production capacity from 32,000 tons to more \nthan 50,000 tons a year by 2017.   \n \nAkay\u2019s expansion plans consist of 5 business activities that are expected to have varying degrees of \nimpact upon stakeholders:  \n  \n1.  Sterilized whole/ground spice plant: Akay is constructing a manufacturing facility in Kerala for \nsteam sterilized whole and ground spices with capacity of 10,000 ton per year, in response to \nhigh demand for clean spices free from any contamination.  \n2.  Seasonings plant: Akay will develop a manufacturing facility in Kerala with capacity of 2,500 ton \nper year and marketing/distribution network for seasonings products. As such, this new plant \nwill help Akay increase the proportion of its domestic sales from about 5% today to more than \n11% by 2018.  \n3.  Nutraceuticals plant expansion: Akay plans to invest in expansion of laboratories in Kerala, \nwhich will result in capacity of 3,000 ton per year, and commercializing major patentable \nproducts by 2017 to scale up this segment.  \n4.  Farm equipment and contract farming: In Cambodia, Akay has purchased and rehabilitated 720 \nhectares in the Battambang province to build a model organic farm. To date, 200 local villagers \nhave been employed, and farmer training, extension work, and field demonstration have been \nconcluded. Commencement of the contract farming activity is expected shortly. The model farm \nis the only Indocert organic farm in Cambodia. Akay aims to reach to 10,000 farmers through \ncontract farming by 2018. Capital expenditures will be needed for drip irrigation systems, \nextension of black pepper cultivation, and expansion of drying yard.  \n5.  Spice extraction plant: In addition, Akay will build an extraction plant in a special economic zone \nin Cambodia (most likely in Phnom Pen or Sihanoukville) with capacity of 3,000 ton per year \nwhich will source raw materials from the model farm and the contract farmers11.  \n \nThe major driver of this project\u2019s impact on poverty will come from prospective contract farming \narrangements.  Contract  farming,  also  known  as  outgrower  schemes,  replace  ad  hoc  trade \nagreements with coordinated commercial relations between producers, processors and traders \nleading to a vertical integration of the agricultural value chain. While there are a number of initial \nconstraints to establishing such schemes (such as establishing trust), they can provide firms with the \nopportunity to control supply while helping farmers improve production standards.12 \n \nThe  outgrower  model  that  Akay  currently  follows  in  Karnataka,  India  is  executed  by  Akay\u2019s \nsubcontractor, RM Betgiri and Company (RMBC). Akay has an annual contract (covering 1 harvest) \nwith RMBC for a specified amount of chilly. RMBC, in turn, have annual (covering 1 harvest) written \ncontracts with farmers. The procurement price in the contract is determined by Akay based on \nmarket conditions. The number of farmers on contract increases with Akay\u2019s requirements for \nproduce. An advance is provided (between 20% and 25%) to the farmers for seeds and inputs, with \n                                                           \n11 Akay commercial and technical RFP  \n12 \u201cOutgrower Schemes \u2013 Why Big Multinationals Link up with African Smallholders\u201d, Felgenhauer and Wolter \n15 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \nthe remaining amount payable to farmers post-harvest. RMBC also provides transport for the \nproduce of farmers, saving them additional costs which regular farmers usually incur.13 \n \nIn this context, most of the prospective farmers are smallholder, subsistence farmers. In Cambodia, \nthe farmers surrounding Akay\u2019s model farm in Battambang are ex Khmer Rouge soldiers, who were \nallotted around 5 acres of land each by the government. These farmers are poor, uneducated and \ndepend on corn or cassava cultivation in a repeated cultivation pattern, which over time exhausts \nthe land and depletes it of key nutrients.14 Thus, prima facie, the potential for impact on the \neconomic situation and productivity of land of these farmers through contract organic farming is \nsignificant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n13 This information was provided by Mr. Srinivas Betgiri of RMBC in an informal interview \n14 \u201cAkay Cambodia Social Development Efforts\u201d, Akay, 2013 \n16 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \n2. OUTLINE OF APPROACH \n \nThis ex-ante Poverty Impact Assessment focuses on Akay\u2019s expansion plans in India and Cambodia, \nwith specific attention to the impact of the proposed  outgrower model it  plans to adopt in \nCambodia. This review has been conducted as a short evaluation, and assesses the following criteria: \n1.  The relevance of this project on people\u2019s income \n2.  Reach: number of people directly benefitting from the project, and their socioeconomic status \nbefore (year 0), in between (years 1 and 3) and after (year 6) the project \n3.  Depth: income increase, what are people doing with the additional money; how does it affect \ntheir poverty situation \n4.  Systemic impact of the project   \n \nAnswers for this have been generated through a combination of desk research, field interviews and \nsurveys. The field surveys in India and Cambodia form the core of our approach, driving insights on \nthe future impact of this project: \n\u2022  Field survey  \nRespondents were surveyed on a range of key financial and socio-economic indicators to assess \nthe various routes to impact for prospective contract farmers \n(cid:1)  India survey \nThe sample consists of 180 households of contract farmers (corresponding to a 95% \nconfidence level and 7% error margin) with a control group of another 178 households \nto get  insights on  1,500  contract  farmers15.  The  location  consists  of  2 districts in \nKarnataka and 2 districts in Andhra Pradesh. Alongside, a sample of 50 women (wives of \nthe contract farmers) were interviewed separately through an add-on questionnaire to \nprovide an additional perspective to the gender impact of the project. \n(cid:1)  Cambodia survey   \nThe  survey  in  Cambodia  include  permanent  employees,  seasonal  workers,  and \nprospective contract farmers. The sample consists of 30 permanent employees (100%), \nseasonal workers (20, 10% of the 200 workers) and 200 households of prospective \ncontract farmers (corresponding to a 95% confidence level and 7% error margin) for a \nmid-term size of 5,000 households. \n\u2022  A review of company documentation to understand and evaluate Akay\u2019s planned route to \nimpact within its sphere of influence \n\u2022  Review of secondary literature on organic farming, crop diversification and financial inclusion in \nrural areas in low-income countries. \n \nBased on this assessment, it articulates a monitoring process going forward.

For example, their average household income was \n15% less than the average household income reported by the control group in Karnataka, and their revenue \nonly 4% higher (as compared to a 17% increment for Andhra Akay farmers). One reason for this could be that \nfarmers in the districts surveyed in Karnataka have generally done well regardless of their association with \nAkay, with comparable yields, prices and higher household incomes. It could also be true that the control \nfarmers were themselves associated with other cooperatives or agro companies that provided them with fair \npricing and market access, along with other facilities that contribute to higher household income. Similarly, it is \nalso possible that the infrastructure facilities, market access and local economy created by Akay in these \ndistricts in Karnataka have had significant spill-over effects to the local community and non-contract farmers, \ntaking them along on the improvements dedicated to Akay\u2019s contract farmers. We cannot be certain of the \nspecific cause without collecting more data and conducting further analysis.   \n19 Indian Labor Bureau Report, 2013; http://labourbureau.nic.in/WRRI_JAN13.pdf  \n24 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \nPermanent employees at Akay\u2019s farm and facilities in Battambang saw a 108% average increase in \nwages after becoming employed under Akay, while farm workers witnessed 71% increase in their \nwages after being hired by Akay. Akay currently pays its farm employees a wage of USD 5/day, or \nroughly USD 130 per working month (26 days). In comparison, the average minimum wage in \nCambodia (2011), is USD61/month20.

The project activities are geared towards \nincreasing production  of high-value  spice products  with  raw produce  to be  sourced from  an \nincreased number of farmers. In India, the project reach is expected to increase from 280 in FY2014 \nto at least 540 non-farm jobs in FY2018. Number of farmers working under contract farming will \nincrease from 3,000 in FY2014 to 6,000 in FY2018. In addition, at least 5000 non-contract farmers \nare expected to be impacted by Akay\u2019s open market procurement policy for spices by 2018. In \nCambodia, Akay\u2019s farm employees will increase from 30 in FY2014 to at least 80 in FY2018 and the \nfarmers working under contract farming will increase from zero in 2013 to 2,000 in FY2018, and to \nan estimated 10,000 in the long-term beyond FY201827.    \n \nTable 10.

Moving  forward, Akay\u2019s \noutgrower model provides us with the estimated net income per farmer from year 1 through 6. \n \nThe results from the India survey can also provide some guidance on the socioeconomic status of \nAkay contract farmers at later stages of the contract farming arrangement. It is, however, to be \nnoted that initial conditions in Cambodia, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are likely to have had \ndifferences and thus such a comparison can only be indicative in nature. Many of the indicators, \nsuch as electricity and piped water connections, are dependent on government provision and differ \naccordingly.   \n \nThe average monthly household income of 194 prospective contract farmers surveyed in Prey Thom \nvillage, Samlot District, Battambang Province is ~676,368 KHR or USD 16730, which translates to a \n                                                           \n27 This is an estimate that has been provided by Akay Spices.

The average household size of farmers was assumed to be 2 (one man one woman). 1500 farmer \nhouseholds are currently contracted by Akay in India, which is expected to double to 3000 households by \n2018. This gives us total contract-farmer reach in India to be 3000 in FY14\u2019 and 6000 in FY18.

As part of the outgrower scheme, \nAkay plans to build a 20 bed healthcare clinic for every 1,000 contract farmers, drastically reducing \ndistance of the population from a health centre and subsequently their transport costs. To improve \naccess to electricity, a windmill will be built per 1,000 contract farmers, for which Akay will bear 50% \nof the cost, with the remainder being split pro rata across farmers. Akay is already in the process of \ninstalling 2 50 kWh windmills as a pilot trial to provide electricity to the model farm and extending \nthe  electricity  supply  to the  surrounding  village.34  This  would  allow  farmers  to  use  relatively \nadvanced irrigation equipment, while reducing the financial burden of grid expansion on Akay. \nMoreover, our survey indicates a need for electricity in the village as only 16.5% of respondents \nclaimed to have an electricity connection in their house. Akay will also build a school per 1,000 \nfarmers.  \n \nThe beneficiaries of these measures will be the contract farmers and their families. The average \nhousehold size of households surveyed in Prey Thom Village, Asothe, Cambodia is 4.75 members. A \nrough estimate of the number of beneficiaries of the above three measures would then be around \n4,750 beneficiaries per measure. As the outgrower scheme expands to its ultimate long-term35 goal \nof 10,000 farmers in the area, the total number of beneficiaries of these measures of access to \nhealth, power and education would be approximately 47,500 people.   \n \nOne indicator on which the project has already had an impact is the value of the land surrounding \nthe model farm \u2013 approximately 55% of respondents in Cambodia have seen the value of their land \nrise since the establishment of the farm. An increase in the value of land coupled with greater \nfinancial inclusion could expand the access to credit of the population (as the land could be used as \ncollateral). While our surveys did not reveal the intent of farmers with reference to their land, if \nfarmers were to sell it, they would receive better prices than they would have before Akay set up the \nmodel farm in Samlot. \n \nAs discussed earlier, working for Akay has increased household income for contract farmers in India. \nAkay contract farmers in India also fare better on many other of the aforementioned indicators. In \nboth Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, 100% of respondents have electricity connections in their \nhomes. There is a disparity between the states in the distribution of toilets. ~71% of respondents in \nAndhra Pradesh have toilets in their homes, compared to only 2% of respondents in Karnataka. ~30% \nof respondents in Andhra Pradesh have a piped water connection, as opposed to ~44% in Karnataka. \nKarnataka fares far better than Andhra Pradesh on income stability, with over 70% of Karnataka \nrespondents claiming a \u2018somewhat stable\u2019 income. Comparatively, in Andhra Pradesh, over 60% of \nrespondents claimed to have a \u2018somewhat unstable\u2019 income and ~30% claimed to have a \u2018very \nunstable\u2019 income.

DEPTH OF THE PROJECT IMPACT \n \nThis section aims to analyse the potential rise in income for farmers associated with Akay, and derive \na broader understanding of the various uses of this incremental income. This analysis will be based \non the 180 farmers surveyed in India that currently work on contract for Akay, and used to predict \nex-ante the potential impact on the prospective farmers in Samlot District, Battambang Province, \nCambodia. \n \nIn India, there is a noticeable difference between the poverty situation of farmers in Karnataka and \nfarmers in Andhra Pradesh. Only 3% of farmers in Karnataka, who have been with Akay for an \naverage of 10 years, are still under the approximated extreme poverty line of USD1.55/day, 31% \nearn less than USD2.33/day, and 56% earn less than USD3.1/day. Approximately 44% of contract-\nfarmers in Karnataka are above the USD3/day poverty line. In Andhra Pradesh, after a short 1 year \naverage engagement with Akay, 69% of farmers are under the approximated extreme poverty line, \n87% under USD2.33/day line, and 98% under USD3.1/day line. A majority of contract-farmers in \nAndhra Pradesh are therefore extremely poor, and almost all of them are in a poverty situation.  \n \nIn Cambodia, 27% of prospective farmers currently fall under the approximated extreme poverty line \nof USD1.3/day, 48% under USD 1.96/day, and 76% under USD3.26/day. 76% of survey respondents \nwho are poor  by  cumulative standards, and 27% who are extremely  poor, present  Akay the \nopportunity to uplift them from poverty by enabling them to earn higher farm revenues and stabilize \nthe receipt of higher household incomes. This poverty alleviation is demonstrated through the \npermanent employees and season farm workers already employed by Akay on its model farm in \nAsothe in Battambang province in Cambodia, all of who earn daily incomes higher than USD~2/day. \nOnly 4% of permanent employees, or 12 people, earned incomes lower than USD3.26/day.    \n \nTable 12.

SYSTEMIC IMPACT OF AKAY EXPANSION PLANS \n \nThe employment, income generating and human capital development activities of Akay are expected \nto have positive externalities in its community systems in Cambodia and India. Some of these have \nalready been witnessed, while others are predicted to have impact in the medium and long term \nduration of Akay\u2019s involvement in farming systems. Akay\u2019s systemic impacts can be divided into 4 \ncategories of:   \n \na.  Promoting equity  \nb.  Supporting pro-poor networks \nc.  Ownership by the poor & enterprise development  \nd.  Sustainability, and long-term community impacts   \n \na.  Promoting equity \n \nIn rural communities in the developing world, the biggest disparity in equitable opportunity is \nbetween men and women. Women typically receive less education, training, job opportunities and \nlabor wages than their male counterparts38 and are a disproportionately significant part of the poor. \nAkay has attempted to alleviate these inequities through a variety of interventions, both directly \nthrough income increases and indirectly through provision of essential services and infrastructure \nrequired for socioeconomic development.  \n \nAkay reports that more than 70% (280) of their farm staff of 400, including the 200 seasonal staff at \nAsothe, Cambodia, are women39, and our survey revealed that 83 of the 194 (43%) prospective \nfarmers around their Asothe model farmers were women too. Inclusion in Akay\u2019s farming and farm-\nsupport activities gives women the chance to participate in productive economic activity and take \nfair wages home to support their household expenses. \nSince women are usually in charge independently or jointly with spouses (94% of prospective farmer \nrespondents in Cambodia reported to have joint control over family expenses40), of household affairs \nand expenses, empowering them economically has been known to translate to direct gains in \neducation for children, reproductive health and nutrition for the family41. In addition to direct \neconomic engagement, Akay has created a self-sufficient community in Tadas, North Karnataka led \nby empowered women, built schools for their children and improved local infrastructure used by \nboth men and women.42 Here, for example, Akay introduced the practice of paying women weekly, \non every Saturday43, so they could directly procure household items at the end of the work-week, \nnot depend on their spouses to allocate funds for purchases, and resist the pressure of allocating \ntheir income to their husband over the household.  \n \nAccording to Akay, its social programs in Tadas have been mutually beneficial for the company and \nits farmers. Akay has been able to increase the volume of raw material sourcing and extraction \noperations through close association with the Chilly farmers in Karnataka. The satisfaction of farmers \nand their confidence in Akay has had positive impacts on Akay\u2019s business. For example, trust \nbetween farmers and the company has allowed for greater transparency in communication and \n                                                           \n38 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Gender Equity in Agriculture Guide; \nftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/i1240e/i1240e00.pdfv \n39 Page 2, Akay Cambodia Social Development efforts PDF.  \n40 Question 58, \u201cwho has control over family expenses?\u201d Cambodia Prospective contract farmers \n41 IFPRI; http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01294.pdf  \n42 Page 3, Akay Cambodia Social Development efforts PDF \n43 Page 31, Project report on expansion plans of Akay group in Cambodia  \n35 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \ntrade, resulting in improvement in overall quality of crucial export-grade raw material processed by \nAkay.  \n \nAkay\u2019s social commitments tie-in closely to its business model. Akay has committed to improving \nliving standards of its farmers and their community by providing social benefits to farmers both \ndirectly; through facilities it builds for communities to increase living standards, and indirectly; by \nbuilding infrastructure for itself that is used as a public good by the community. These activities \nincrease farmer loyalty, and can result in better health and productivity outcomes of farmers. Survey \nresults  from  Karnataka  confirm  the  loyalty-effect  of  Akay\u2019s  interventions,  where  farmers \noverwhelmingly express satisfaction with their engagement with Akay. \nAt  Akay\u2019s  model  farm  in  Asothe,  Cambodia,  the  company  provides  all  staff  free  housing; \nindependent female staff workers receive separate quarters from men (ensuring safety and privacy), \nand women as part of a household receive housing with their family. Finally, Akay provides child-\ncare facilities at the model farms so  women can be  productively engaged  while a dedicated \ncaretaker takes care of their young children. These initiatives make a better work environment for \nworking, young-mothers and reduce the opportunity cost of their employment on their households. \nFinally, including women into the fold of productive activities and linking them with the local farmer \nnetwork can have multiplier effects in terms of confidence building, social and political participation \nat the local level, and exchange of information and ideas with gender parity44.    \n \nb.  Supporting pro-poor networks \n \nPro-poor  networks  can be  enabled  and  expanded  through direct and  indirect  intervention  in \nnetwork creation and integration. Akay emphasizes its social development responsibility which it \nimplements by creating direct economic opportunity for poor farmers (all of who are, on average, \nbelow the international poverty line of USD 2/day prior to joining Akay45). Contracting farmers, and \naggregating their outputs under Akay\u2019s umbrella connects previously disjointed and subsistence \nfarmers into the formal market economy of organic spices, and by doing so links the demand and \nprices  for  their  products  with  the  international  market.  The  farmer\u2019s  integration  into  the \ninternational  market  involves  both  a  direct  supplier  relationship  with  it,  as  well  as  de  facto \nimprovements in farming methodologies up to international organic market standards adopted by \nAkay. As reported in the India farmer surveys46, farmers as a result get better prices for their \nproduce as compared to local markets, improve their yields47, and reduce their dependence on \nfertilizers,  insecticides  and  pesticides  because  of  organic-technology  intervention.  Though \nintegrating farmer networks into the larger market potentially opens them to risks of price volatility, \nAkay\u2019s pre-fixed contract prices48 hedges against erratic movements in the market.  \n \nAkay provides extensive training to all its contract farmers in learning multi-cropping, weeding and \nsoil management, as well as the use of new machinery, installation of drip-irrigation systems \n(providing monetary credit for the same) and using organic substitutes for farm chemicals49. 57% of \ncontract farmers in Andhra who joined the contract scheme in the past 1 year and 100% of \n                                                           \n44 \u201cWomen\u2019s employment, empowerment, and globalization: an economic perspective,\u201d Elissa Braunstein, \n2008; http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/ws2009/documents/EC-WSRWD-2008-\nEP3%20Braunstein%2026Feb09.pdf \n45 Credit Suisse, \u2018Assignment brief for cooperation with ADB on Market Study for Spices and poverty impact \nanalysis in India and Cambodia\u2019 \n46 Question 25, \u201cSelling price of crop,\u201d India chilly farmer survey  \n47 It must be noted, however, that increase in total yields in India is largely due to increases in total landholding \nunder cultivation per farmer; Indian chilly farmer survey   \n48 Akay Outgrowers Model   \n49 Page 33, \u2018Project report on expansion plans of Akay group in Cambodia\u2019 \n36 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \npermanent farm employees surveyed in Samlot reported receiving training from Akay of some sort. \nTechnical training helps spread up-to-date information and best practices of the industry among \nfarmer networks who can then utilize the information according to their specific needs. Introducing \nscientific  and  economic  information  into  networks  of  poor  people  also  lessens  information \nasymmetry that typically forces farmers to rely on third parties for basic knowledge, and increases \ntheir self-reliance.  \nAt its contract-farming set-up in Asothe, Cambodia, Akay plans to spend a total of USD150,000 per \nyear on its training center and training activities. The in-house training sessions will be inclusive of \naccommodation, a USD200 stipend per farmer, and USD100 worth of food for the farmers, who will \nattend these sessions once, for the first month of the first year of contracting with Akay. This all-\ninclusive package would ensure a smaller opportunity cost of attending the 1-month training session \nin terms of lost labor and income, and add technical skills and knowhow to the individual farmer, \nand farmer community, knowledge bank.  \n \nAkay plans to spend a total of USD 585,000 \u2013 USD 500,000 on windmills, USD 75,000 on schools, and \nUSD 10,000 on healthcare clinics - on social and energy infrastructure in year 3 of the project (FY18). \nThis expenditure equals a per capita expenditure of USD58.59 on education for the children of \nfarmers, and USD7.81 on healthcare facilities. The  creation of physical infrastructure \u2013 roads, \nschools, housing, health-care clinics - as demonstrated and planned by Akay in India and Cambodia50, \nrespectively,  can have major impacts on empowering poor communities, and expanding  their \nproductive outreach to surrounding economies. For example, Akay has reported a steady and \nsignificant  influx  of  approximately  10,000  poor  farmers,  traders,  etc.  into  Asothe,  since  the \ndevelopment of road infrastructure in and out of Asothe51. The improvement of local roads has been \nconfirmed by survey respondents in Karnataka as well as Samlot, Cambodia. While roads can help \nmove people and goods in and out of remote areas, as they are observed to be doing around \ncontract farms, schools, housing, health-care clinics and other social infrastructure can improve the \nliving standards of poor people, and by providing the same for free or a subsidized rate, increase \ntheir disposable income which can be saved for long-term needs of households (such as daughter\u2019s \nmarriage or children\u2019s college). In this respect, 96% of permanent farm employees at the model farm \nin Asothe reported improvements in roads, and 100% of them agreed to improvements in water, \nhealth services, education for children and reduction in land mines in the village.52  \n \nSurvey results from Andhra and Karnataka point towards a positive development in the farmer\u2019s \nutilization of his incremental income gained from association with Akay. 52% of all contract-farmer \nrespondents in India reported to have spent part of their incremental income on improvement to \nthe house, and towards better farm implements. 20%, each, spent part of their incremental income \non a new vehicle, household appliances, and on their children\u2019s education53. Akay\u2019s systemic impact, \nthrough the instrument of higher farmer incomes, has expanded the capacity of farmers to make \nnecessary investments in upgrading living standards, as well as boosting the local economy by \nincreasing the purchasing power of farmers. To this date, Akay has spent approximately INR 8million \n(USD~133,333) towards social development at its model village in Tadas, Karnataka.  \n \nc.  Ownership by the poor and enterprise development \n \nAkay\u2019s in-field training program with Battambang University, Department of Agriculture, sends \ngraduate students to work on the Akay farm to learn practices and share their inputs. This system \n                                                           \n50 Page 34, ibid  \n51 Page 6, \u2018Akay Cambodia Social Development efforts\u2019  \n52 Questions 46-50, Akay Permanent Employees survey \n53 Question 63, India chilly farmer survey  \n37 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \nencourages the widening of pro-poor networks by introducing academic knowledge and methods \nthrough visiting student agents.  For example, Akay has already reported on positive effects of \nintroducing machinery in farming practices at their Asothe model farm. Apart from the direct time-\nsavings, Akay has observed increased participation and involvement of farmers in designing and \nbuilding low-cost machinery for their use54. Akay promises to provide financial assistance towards \nsetting up of schools, windmills and healthcare clinics, which will then be funded by the farmer after \nFY 18 towards shared-ownership of these facilities55. Shared ownership and cost-burden would help \nAkay farmers in setting up energy and social facilities whose economic and social gains would be \nabsorbed by Akay and the farmer community jointly. While reducing the initial cost-burden on the \nfarmers, the long-term view of ownership of facilities can bring a sense of ownership among the \nfarmers and employees, and enable them to have control over local outcomes adjusted to local \nneeds towards energy, education and health. A sense of ownership is likely to foster a stronger \ncommunity and social cohesion, as well as loyalty between Akay and its contractors that encourages \nreinvestment into the local community.   \n \nEvidence  from  Akay,  and  from  external  case  studies56suggests  that  with  the  introduction  of \ntechnology,  the  upgradation  of  capacity  to  use  the  technology,  and  provision  of  physical \ninfrastructure to support innovation, there is increased opportunity for enterprise development in \nregions surrounding Akay\u2019s facilities. If Akay extends its support towards small-scale IT grids in its \nmodel farm, farmer networks can leverage cheap communication and information access towards \nentrepreneurial interests. It is logical to assume that the spill-over effects of higher wages, farm \nincome, productive capacity and infrastructure will in-turn create further economic opportunities in \nsurrounding areas, and encourage the formation of self-help and independent enterprises catering \nto rising demand and incomes.  \n \nd.  Sustainability, and long-term community impacts \n \nEnvironmental  sustainability  of project operation  and  its  ecological  impact  has  major  impact-\npotential on rural social and economic systems. The organic farming model can strengthen network \ncapacity by restoring ecosystems and sustainably managing resources for guaranteed long-term \nreturns on the land \u2013 reducing the long-term burden of resource exhaustion, nutrient depletion and \nchemical leeching on the local community. The reduction of farm chemicals (insecticides, pesticides \nand fertilizers) in farming system reduces the aggregation of these chemicals into the local ecology \nwhich can otherwise pollute fresh water systems and animal food chains. Reducing the short and \nmedium-term cost borne by the ecology, and making current impact as sustainable as possible, \nensures that farmers in Samlot district will not be deprived off the carrying capacity of their land and \necosystem in the long run. Most importantly, environmentally-sustainable practice ensures better \nhealth for locals, their children, livestock and ecosystem in the long run, further reducing the cost of \nexternalities of Akay\u2019s farming system compared to other intensive systems.  \n \nAkay\u2019s organic certification from INDOCERT for growing 7 types of products at the Asothe, and its \nongoing compliance with standards requirements, ensures that globally-accepted organic farming \npractices  are  implemented  within  Akay\u2019s  outgrower  system.  INDOCERT\u2019s  requirement  for \ncompliance with the National Standards for Organic Production, specifically with regards to farm \ninputs of fertilizers, soil conditioners, and plant protection57, and its regular monitoring of the same, \n                                                           \n54 Page 39, \u2018Akay Cambodia Social Development efforts\u2019 \n55 Akay Outgrowers Model \n56 American Journal of Agricultural Economics; \u2018Impacts of Technology and Structural Change on Agricultural \nEconomy, Rural Communities, and the Environment,\u2019 Lu, Yao-chi, 1985 \n57 FAQ\u2019s, INDOCERT; http://www.indocert.org/index.php/en/faq/organic-agriculture \n38 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \nguarantees  that  the  benefits  of  organic  certification  will  be  translated  into  on-the-ground \nenvironmentally system practices on out-grower farms.      \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \n7. RECOMMENDATIONS \n \nRecommendations for monitoring impact \n \nThere are a number of measures that Akay, due to its proximity and reach, can effectively take to \nmonitor the impact of the project on the poverty situation of its beneficiaries. This section outlines \nsome such measures and provides a rationale behind each. We recommend that this monitoring \ntakes place on an annual basis. \n \n1.  Basic income and expenditure information \nImplement monitoring system that collects data on farmer incomes and expenditure (divided \nbroadly into food, energy, and non-food, non-energy items) only a monthly basis, which will help \nAkay keep track of the direct impact upon the income and wellbeing of beneficiaries \n2.  Standards of living  \nAkay should track indicators such as access to water, sanitation, healthcare and electricity. As \nobserved in the India surveys, in improvement in income due to contract farming may not \nnecessarily translate into the other indicators that determine socio-economic status.  \n3.  Financial inclusion \nAkay should track the number of contract farmers that have a bank account. Financial inclusion \nof outgrowers will simplify payments and loans made by Akay, while also providing avenues for \nsavings and investment for account holders \n4.  Satisfaction barometer \nAkay can track the satisfaction levels of farmers at regular intervals to measure the pulse of the \nproject impact. The ability to respond to shifts in satisfaction will help farmer retention  \n5.  Attendance of training sessions \nTracking attendance of training sessions will help Akay realise the utilization of its investment in \ntraining of farmers, and help identify gaps in provision and assimilation of knowledge. Only 4% of \nrespondents in Karnataka claimed to have been provided training, and the corresponding figure \nwas 52% in Andhra Pradesh. \n6.  Gender inclusion \nConsult and survey women as an independent group to note the best gender-specific methods \nto fulfil essential needs. This will help account for gender norms and disparities when providing \nservices, for example at a public space (training, etc.). Women often require reserved spaces for \nequitable distribution of public and private benefits \n \nRecommendations for Akay business model  \n \nBased on our survey results, we have identified a few areas in which Akay could improve its impact \nperformance by making adjustments to its business model. These small modifications in strategy can \nempower Akay to use its impact instruments more effectively and systematically to improve social \nimpact in its farming community in India and Cambodia;   \n  \n1.  Social-impact maximization \nOur survey responses have indicated that Akay\u2019s outgrowers model has not had optimal impact on a \nfew essential socioeconomic indicators in India; the provision of local and household infrastructure \nand access to banking facilities. Of the 190 contract farmers surveyed in Andhra and Karnataka, only \n3% reported improvements in roads by Akay, 5% reported improvement in provision of electricity, \nand no respondents reported improvements in access to water, access to health care, education for \nchildren, access to bank accounts and loan facilities. Similarly, under household infrastructure \nindicators, 61% of all respondents (and 98% in Karnataka) still lived in homes made of natural \n40 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \nmaterials (predominantly mud and hay), only 37% had toilets in their homes, and only 37% had \npiped  water.  These  infrastructural  indicators  are  under  the  direct  mandate  of  elected  state \ngovernments and local implementation bodies, and Akay does not have direct responsibility of \nproviding basic public goods to its farmers. Additionally, these are survey results of a small sample of \n190 contract farmers, it is possible that many infrastructure improvements have not been captured \nby the sample group, or that the farmer\u2019s expectations of improvement were not met by actual \nresults, leading them to respond negatively.  \n \nTo increase its social impact, Akay can intervene in places of local government and market failure, \nand assist local authorities to work with stakeholders to build concrete houses, improve roads, and \nprovide water and sanitation facilities to homes in the community. Credit facility for housing \nupgrades, for example, can assist in making household infrastructure more affordable for farmers. \nWith respect to banking services, a large part of inaccessibility, beyond lack of banking outlets, is due \nto farmer illiteracy and unawareness of basic banking procedures. Akay can help bridge this capacity \ngap by providing financial literacy classes and assistance in filling out paperwork to empower its \ncontract-farmers manage their finances better. These improvements in life standards and associated \ngoodwill with it can encourage farmer loyalty to Akay, increase their satisfaction, and through this \nprocess, reduce farmer attrition and transaction costs in the contract-farming model.  \n \n2.  Contract terms and pricing \nAnother area that merits attention is the contract terms and pricing model of Akay. While our survey \ndata does not empower us to make specific judgments on contract terms, responses to the open-\nended question \u201cHave you experienced any problems in your work with Akay?\u201d in Andhra Pradesh \nrevealed significant disaffection among farmers. The most popular responses to this question were \n\u201crate problem,\u201d \u201dshould have fixed market and rate,\u201d \u201cshould buy crop quickly,\u201d which suggest that \ncontract farmers in Andhra are not happy with the rate at which Akay buys their crops, and the \nfrequency with which it procures farm output from farmers. However, since farmers in Karnataka \nresponded to the same question with overwhelming satisfaction with their current state, the \ndisparity in satisfaction levels between Andhra and Karnataka could be a function of the time of \nengagement with Akay in the two locations. Andhra farmers have only been farming under Akay\u2019s \ncontract for an average of 1 year, while their Karnataka counterparts have done so for average of 10. \nMany of the benefits of contract terms may require a medium-term gestation period, such as \ncontract  pricing  averaging  out  to  be  higher  than  market  prices  over  a  long-term  period. \nNevertheless,  it would be  useful for  Akay  to  review  its  contract  terms and pricing model in \nconsultation with Andhra farmers to identify the point of disaffection and resolve it successfully.  \n \nOur time-effects hypothesis was supported by Akay\u2019s assessment of its performance in Andhra \nPradesh. In response to our queries, Akay said \u201cThe association with farmers in Andhra Pradesh has \nbeen a recent one for Akay. We have started contract farming with the farmers in Andhra Pradesh \nbasically to support our new project. i.e sterilized whole/ground spices ( under new group company \nAkay Spices Pvt Ltd.). It has been only around 6 months\u2019 association with these farmers in Andhra \nPradesh.  Short length of association with them is the major reason for limited impact at this point. \nHowever, in the coming years, we hope to improve the relationship with them through measures \nwhich can have positive impact both Akay and farmers in a mutually beneficial way.\u201d \n \n3.  Communication strategy \nEffective communication with its farmers should be a key strategy for Akay to ensure success over \nthe long-term. At the time of the survey, 99% of prospective contract farmers in Cambodia were not \naware of any training programs for themselves and their spouses, 96% didn\u2019t think they would get \nbetter prices from Akay compared to the present, and only 14% believed their incomes would have \nany increase after contract farming for Akay. While survey results in India and Akay\u2019s own plans \n41 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \nreveal positive impacts on the aforementioned indicators, the prospective farmers in Samlot have \nnot been communicated the same effectively. Akay could benefit from having a dedicated farmer \noutreach team that liaises directly with the farmers to speak about company plans likely to affect \nthem, upcoming training sessions, timelines of infrastructure work, and collects feedback from \nfarmers on its training sessions, on pressing needs of the community and to gauge their satisfaction \nlevels  annually  or  bi-annually.  Increasing  the  information  symmetry  between  Akay  workers, \nemployees and farmers, giving them access to information and making them active stakeholders in \nsocial-impact plans, are all likely to improve their satisfaction with Akay. \n \nAkay  was  receptive  to  the  recommendations  laid  out  in  this  report.  Akay  welcomed  the \nrecommendations on annual measures for monitoring impact.

In South and East Asia, women often do not have equal access \nto education,  paid  employment and property  rights,  and  reproductive health services  can  be \nextremely scarce. In Cambodia, many women have had to shoulder the responsibility of heading \ntheir households after losing male members in violent conflicts.60As a result, living standards of \nwomen  are  often  worse  than  the  average  poor  person:  a  problem  that  is  compounded  by \ninadequate  distribution  of  women-specific  infrastructure  such  as  reproductive  health  services, \nmaternity centers and water and sanitation facilities.  \n \nAkay\u2019s expansion plans in Kerala, India and Battambang, Cambodia seek to impact women with the \nexpected outcome of improving their poverty and living situation. We can assess the expected \nimpact of Akay\u2019s activities on women in four ways: \n \ni)  Ex-post analysis of Akay\u2019s activities using survey data from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka  \nii)  Calculating baseline conditions of women around Akay\u2019s model farm in Samlot district, \nBattambang  \niii)  Analyzing Akay\u2019s expansion to understand planned instruments of gender impact  \niv)  Identifying places of high-impact potential on the basis of survey results \n \nThis analysis attempts to show the links between Akay\u2019s contract farming model and related \nactivities, and the change in socioeconomic, employment and living conditions of women. In India, \nsurvey results of 180 Akay male farmers and 51 wives of these chilly farmers have been used to \ndemonstrate intervention effects. In Cambodia, survey results of 83 prospective women farmers in \nAsothe, Samlot District, Cambodia, have been used to create a baseline of women\u2019s socioeconomic \nstatus, which has then been applied to identify current conditions and opportunities for high gender \nimpact. Finally, we review ex-post impact results, ex-ante potential impact, and areas of impact \ngaps, to propose improvements in the gender-impact of Akay\u2019s expansion activities in India and \nCambodia.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n58 UN MDG Factsheet: http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Goal_3_fs.pdf: accessed 05/30/2014.  \n59 Page 25, JICA Cambodia  \n60 IFAD, Operations: http://www.ifad.org/operations/projects/regions/pi/factsheets/kh.pdf: accessed \n05/30/2014 \n44 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \n \n9: OBSERVED GENDER IMPACT IN INDIA \n \nFor the purpose of this study, in addition to the survey of 180 male chilly farmers, a sample of 51 \nwomen (26 in Andhra Pradesh, 25 in Karnataka)61 to gauge the condition of women on important \nsocioeconomic  indicators.  These  women  were  surveyed  independently  from  men  and  their \nhouseholds  to  provide  them  with  an  environment  where  they  could  respond  without  being \ninfluenced by dominant members of their household. At the same time, our survey of male chilly \nfarmers had a number of questions to assess gender impact from their point of view too. Overall, \n86% (155) of 180 men surveyed had wives working on an Akay contract farm. The two sets of \nresponses should provide a good indicator of the overall conditions of women under contract and/or \nemploy of Akay in India.  \n \nTables 13 & 14 show results under key indicators of financial access, inclusion and equality from the \nwomen specific survey:  \n \nTable 13.

However, their responses are still indicative of the general conditions \nwitnessed by women in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh under Akay contracts, and can be used to draw \nreasonable conclusions about gender impacts in the two states.  \n45 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \n4% of women in Karnataka, versus 80% in Andhra said they had one in their name. Such a large \ndisparity cannot be sufficiently explained by survey data, but could be due to major differences in \ngovernment policy and access to banks in the two regions surveyed. Outliers such as this make it \ndifficult to draw causal links between Akay\u2019s activities and general quality of life indicators, but the \nresults from this analysis help conceive a general understanding of Akay\u2019s impact on women under \nits employ or contract.  \n \n \ni)  Financial Inclusion and control: \n \n    Figure 15.

Overall, 53% of the total sample of 51 women reported having stable incomes, 18% \nreported unstable incomes, and 29% did not respond to the question.  76% of women in Karnataka \nreported having stable incomes (ranging from very stable to somewhat stable), whereas only 31% \nreported the same in Andhra Pradesh. 50% of women in Andhra Pradesh gave no response to the \nquestion at all, suggesting lack of basic information or awareness about personal or household \nincomes. Additionally, it is possible that this question did not conform to local social norms, where \nwomen may reserve their response on personal financial information to private spaces.  \n \nThis data suggests that a large majority of women in Karnataka under Akay\u2019s contract, receive stable \nincomes from the company which can help pay routine bills and structure finances to better meet \nthe needs of their households. For example, case studies have shown that stable incomes for men \nand women help parents commit to essential needs of their children, predominantly their education \nand nutrition62. Since school fees require regular payments, and improvements in nutrition require \nstable incomes to be able to allocate money to purchase more nutritious food, stable incomes for \nwomen in Karnataka can be expected to translate into gains for the household and children.   \n                                                           \n62 In a 2013 study on impacts of BoP venture Villa Andina, researchers found significant positive impacts on the education, \nhealth and capability (education) indicators of children of farmers receiving stable incomes.

Figure 16 shows a wide \ngap between women bank account holders in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, as highlighted earlier. \nOnly 4% of the 25 women in Karnataka had a bank account in their own name, versus 81% who had \nthe same in the Andhra Pradesh. 6% of men in Karnataka said their wives had a bank account in their \nname, compared to 56% in Andhra Pradesh. This suggests an inadequacy of banking services \noutreach for women in Karnataka. Alternatively, the limitations on holding bank accounts could be \ninfluenced by social and gender norms in Karnataka that prefer husbands, fathers or sons to hold the \nbank account on behalf of the woman. The social norm theory is supported by the fact that 80% of \nmen with wives who had bank accounts in Karnataka said they had control over the account, versus \n53% in Andhra Pradesh. Differences in social norms could also help explain the contrasting data \nrepresented in figure 5-6, where 40% of women in Karnataka reported having control over their \nearnings, but only 13% of men said the same about their wives. Similarly 35% of women in Andhra \nPradesh said they controlled their own earnings, compared to 18% of men who said the same about \ntheir wives. A sizeable 50% of women respondents in Andhra Pradesh did not respond to the \nquestion of having control over their earnings, indicating lack of information and agency amongst \nthe women there.  \n \nAccess to banking is a key step in the financial inclusion of women in the formal economy, and a \nmethod to shore up household finances be giving women power over expenditure allocation. Having \ncontrol over a bank account could lead to greater agency than keeping cash money, which can be \neasily coerced off the woman by male dominant members, and spent quicker due to physical \nconvenience.

This \npercentage is halved when men were asked to report the same about their wives. This could have \nthree potential implications:  \ni)  The larger sample of 180 male farmers better represents the actual situation of financial \ninclusion and control of women, compared to the smaller sample of 50 women  \nii)  There is a mismatch of understanding over financial control between husbands and their wives, \nwhere wives are given symbolic control of their account even though actual control rests with \nthe husband \niii)  Women in Karnataka choose alternative methods of financial management to the formalized \nsystem because of a variety of social, economic and state-related reasons.  \n \nInformal arrangements of cash savings in personal deposit boxes, reliance on informal bankers, and \nlack of knowledge on the benefits of banking may also contribute to the outcomes we have seen. \nThese areas can be useful targets of awareness, support and capacity-building strategies for Akay.  \n \nii)  Employment and empowerment:  \n \nFigure 21.

Each of these effects were \nstronger in women than in men. For example, daily private expenditures of women in treatment group increased by 37% \ncompared to the control group. This is one demonstration of the strong multiplier effects of formal savings account usage \nby women in rural areas.

For example, in the model of Galor and Zeira (1993), it is because of financial market frictions that poor people \ncannot invest in their education, despite their high marginal productivity of investment. In Banerjee and Newman\u2019s model \n(1993), the occupational choices of individuals (between becoming entrepreneurs or remaining wage earners) are limited \nby the initial endowments. These occupational choices determine how much the individuals can save and what risks they \ncan bear, with long-run implications for growth and income distribution.These models show that lack of access to finance \ncan be critical for generating persistent income inequality or poverty traps, as well as lower growth.\u201d \u201cGlobal Financial \nDevelopment Report,\u201d The World Bank Group; \nhttps://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/16238/9780821399859.pdf?sequence=4;  \n \n49 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 22.

In Figure 21, this \nemphasis is verified by Karnataka results, where 84% of the women who have been associated with \nAkay for an average of 10 years (versus 1 year in Andhra) reported improvements in their work \nconditions after contract-farming for Akay. Andhra Pradesh presents reverse outcomes: 92% of \nwomen here reported seeing no improvements in working conditions since contract farming for \nAkay.  This  vast  disparity  could  be  explained,  in  part,  by  the  difference  in  average  length  of \nassociation with Akay in the two states, which could affect the delivery of tangible benefits in the \ntime limit imposed by the survey date. Additionally, it could be possible that the implementation of \nimprovements in physical work processes has not been adequately implemented in Andhra Pradesh \ncontract farms, which could be a region of strategic evaluation for Akay.   \n \nFigure 22-23 gives a similar picture of impact in the two states. While 80% of women respondents in \nKarnataka, and 87% of men (on behalf of their wife\u2019s), felt an increase in control over their earnings \nsince working for Akay, only 4% of women in Andhra Pradesh, and 8% of men on behalf of their \nwives, reported feeling the same effect. The reasons for this disparity could be similar to the \nprevious indicators: the time of engagement could be a constraint on the delivery of benefits to \nmedium-term engagements in Andhra Pradesh. Additionally, the actual impact on women\u2019s financial \nbehavior and work conditions could be minimal in Andhra Pradesh, and requires additional scrutiny \nby Akay\u2019s management and ground staff.  \n \n \n                                                           \n69 From India Male Chilly Farmer Survey  \n50 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 24.

Overall, the highest percentage of women reported doing \ndrying (78%) and tending to crops (73%) tasks, while ploughing was done by the smallest number of \nwomen (20%). This tells us that when investing in technological improvements and time-saving \nimplement upgrades, Akay can target investments relating to drying and crop tending activities to \ndeliver maximum benefit to the largest possible population of women contract-farmers.  \n \nCurrently, Akay has implemented the following technological improvements to reduce the \nwork/time burden of farmer women: \n\u2022  Akay has been  promoting the use of natural pheromone traps in their farms, by which women \ncan prevent pest attacks on the farms \n\u2022  Akay has been promoting the use of polythene sheets for the purpose of drying, so that women \ndon\u2019t have to dry material in the mud. By this, contamination with mud, soil etc. can be avoided, \nwhich reduces time burden on women.  \n\u2022  Farmers are not required to carry their output to our factory. Instead, Akay collects the produce \ndirectly from their farms using our own vehicles. This greatly reduces the physical and time \nburden on women carrying heavy farm produce to farms, and allows them to allocate time \nelsewhere.  \n\u2022  Akay supplies collection bags, free of cost, so farmers don\u2019t have to spend their disposable \nincomes doing so.  \n \n \n51 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \niii)  Income  \n \nTable 15.

In Andhra Pradesh, women sampled reported earning ~USD46 per month, \nagainst the state average per capita monthly income of ~USD84. This means that women under \ncontract farming arrangements with Akay in Andhra earn ~USD38 less than the average state per \ncapita income. This result is confirmed by survey respondents in Andhra Pradesh, where 85% of \nwomen surveyed said they saw no change in incomes since working with Akay, whereas 88% of \nwomen in Karnataka reported small increases in their income under Akay.  \nWomen in both states are, however, above the international extreme poverty line of USD1.25/day \nor USD37.5/month, though women in Andhra earn only ~USD9 above this poverty line, per month. \nThe disparity of USD54.21/month between the incomes of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh women \nrespondents support the patterns in financial indicators discussed above, and presents a point that \nrequires significant attention and review from Akay.

The high rates of affirmative responses (more than 50%) to \nall options barring purchase of vehicle, indicates the high potential impact of incremental income on \nthe lives of women and their households.  \n \nThe expenditure pattern also demonstrates the potential for multiplying Akay\u2019s impact on women \namong the community: by assisting them in the efficient allocation of additional resources on buying \nmore nutritious food for the household, investing in upgrades to farm inputs, educating their \nchildren, and improving the physical infrastructure and facilities of individual homes. The alignment \nof expenditure preferences between men and women is supported by 93% of women respondents \nwho reported having joint control over expenses with their partners. Lastly, 73% of women, and an \nequal number of men, reported having very unstable incomes, which is an area with positive results \nin Karnataka, India (76% of women respondents reported having stable incomes there). Thus, Akay \ncan demonstrably cause improvement in the stability of incomes of women farmers in Cambodia, \nand help them use financial parity at home to distribute gains of incremental incomes beneficially.  \n \n \n \n                                                           \n76 As reported by women respondents among Cambodia prospective farmers \n54 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11: STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS IN INDIA AND CAMBODIA \n  \nAkay reports that more than 70% (280) of their farm staff of 400, including the 200 seasonal staff at \nAsothe, Cambodia, are women77, and our survey revealed that 83 of the 194 (43%) prospective \nfarmers around their Asothe model farmers were women too. Inclusion in Akay\u2019s farming and farm-\nsupport activities gives women the chance to participate in productive economic activity and take \nfair  wages  home  to  support  their  household  expenses.  Since  women  are  usually  in  charge \nindependently or jointly with spouses (94% of prospective farmer respondents in Cambodia reported \nto have joint control over family expenses78), of household affairs and expenses, empowering them \neconomically has been known to translate to direct gains in education for children, reproductive \nhealth and nutrition for the family79.  \n \nIn addition to direct economic engagement, Akay has created a self-sufficient community in Tadas, \nNorth Karnataka led by empowered women, built schools for their children and improved local \ninfrastructure used by both men and women.80 Here, for example, Akay introduced the practice of \npaying women weekly, on every Saturday81, so they could directly procure household items at the \nend of the work-week, not depend on their spouses to allocate funds for purchases, and resist the \npressure of allocating their income to their husband over the household.  \n \nAt  Akay\u2019s  model  farm  in  Asothe,  Cambodia,  the  company  provides  all  staff  free  housing: \nindependent female staff workers receive separate quarters from men (ensuring safety and privacy), \nand women as part of a household receive housing with their family. Finally, Akay provides child-\ncare facilities at the model farms so  women can be  productively engaged  while a dedicated \ncaretaker takes care of their young children. These initiatives make a better work environment for \nworking, young-mothers and reduce the opportunity cost of their employment on their households. \nFinally, including women into the fold of productive activities and linking them with the local farmer \nnetwork can have multiplier effects in terms of confidence building, social and political participation \nat the local level, and exchange of information and ideas with gender parity82.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n77 Page 2, Akay Cambodia Social Development efforts PDF.  \n78 Question 58, \u201cwho has control over family expenses?\u201d Cambodia Prospective contract farmers \n79 IFPRI: http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01294.pdf  \n80 Page 3, Akay Cambodia Social Development efforts PDF \n81 Page 31, Project report on expansion plans of Akay group in Cambodia  \n82 \u201cWomen\u2019s employment, empowerment, and globalization: an economic perspective,\u201d Elissa Braunstein, \n2008: http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/ws2009/documents/EC-WSRWD-2008-\nEP3%20Braunstein%2026Feb09.pdf \n55 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12: AREAS OF HIGH POTENTIAL GENDER-IMPACT \n \nBy compiling the results of our surveys, and analyzing Akay\u2019s own expansion plans in India and \nCambodia, the categorical impacts of Akay\u2019s activities on women are visible. The project plan \nguarantees that a sizeable number of women will be directly extended economic opportunities of \nfair-wage labor, receive incremental income based on Akay\u2019s premium pricing and wage rates, and \naccess to basic infrastructure such as roads, water, health services and markets. However, as \nevidence from Andhra Pradesh and Cambodia illustrates, in issues that are heavily influenced by \nlocal social and cultural norms, as well as prevailing state and administrative conditions, there is vast \nscope for improvement. Social benefits, beyond better income and work conditions, have not been \nreported by survey respondents in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The main delivery mechanism of \nsocial benefits \u2013 community infrastructure - has not seen improvements under Akay, barring the \nmaintenance of roads. The reason behind the absence of service delivery could be that Akay has not \ninvested in public infrastructure (rather only invested in captive infrastructure relating to its own \nactivities), or because the specific villages surveyed were yet to see infrastructure interventions. It\u2019s \nrecommended  that  Akay  focus  on  the  following  activities  to  improve  its  gender  impact  in \ncommunities of its contract-farmers:  \n \ni)  Banking and finance: Women, by and large, do not a bank account in their name in all areas \nsurveyed.  Akay  can  have  a  dedicated  financial  inclusion  strategy  where  it  provides \ninformation, training and awareness on basic banking practices to women, and monitors the \nreach of banking services to women under its employ. Akay can implement its end-of-week \npayment system for women across contract-farmers in India and Cambodia.   \nii)  Training and information dispersal: None of the 83 women respondents in Cambodia were \naware of training provided by Akay, and only ~9% of respondents in India said their wives \nreceived any form of training from Akay. Akay should ensure the delivery of its training \nsession  to  women,  and  coordinate  with them  over  the best  timings and methods  to \ndisseminate training materials.  \niii)  Reproductive health services and social infrastructure: In India, there was no reported \nimprovement in water, health services and education for children from the time of contract \nfarming with Akay. Akay should built a maternity clinic at its model farm for the large \nwomen  population  engaged  there.  The  team  should  ensure  women  have  access \nreproductive and other health services, have potable water within their households or \ncommunities, and can send their children to school without difficulty.  \n \nFigure 28. Potential impact of extending banking services to women \nThese interventions are likely to add significant tangible monetary and non-monetary benefits to the \nlives of women, and through them, to their household members. The cost and time savings related \nwith provision of aforementioned basic services can be translated into gains for the family and \n56 \n ", "TA-8550 REG: Inclusive Business Support - Impact Assessment Specialist for \nAkay (India & Cambodia) (46240-001) \n \n \nchildren by the working mother. Most importantly, improvements in these sectors can contribute to \nthe expansion of women\u2019s agency in rural areas, which can lead to greater empowerment and \ncontrol over outcomes in areas of need for women. It is important to be mindful of cultural and \nsocial context within which each community is placed, so Akay can help overcome the barriers \ninformally placed upon women in their specific contexts83.  For example, it may be beneficial to hold \nspecial  gender-specific  information and  training  sessions for women,  instead  of gender-mixed \ngroups, to accommodate the needs of women and to ensure delivery of information to them with \nlessened obstruction from more dominant men. It would be best, therefore, that women were made \nactive stakeholders in the design and implementation of the contract-farm expansion in Cambodia, \nand the setting up of processing plants in Kerala: their views, ideas and needs be noted, accounted \nfor and integrated into the project plans of Akay for long-term sustainability.     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n83 \nHere, the insights shared by the World Bank study, Rural Women in the Sahel and their Access to \nAgricultural Extension, 1995, can be very useful: \u201cWomen have less time than men, and certain periods of day \nare dedicated to specific activities.
