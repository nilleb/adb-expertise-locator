Tajikistan is mountainous with a population of 9.1 million in 2018, of which 47% lives on \nless than $1.33 per day.1 Agriculture accounts for 20% of the national gross domestic product and \nemploys about 51% of the population. With only 7% of land being arable, limited land per capita \nof 0.1 hectares and underdeveloped agriculture with low yields, it has the highest level of food \ninsecurity in Central Asia. Irrigation and drainage (I&D) infrastructure is outdated and dilapidated \nfurther  constraining  agricultural  productivity.  Water  users  have  low  capacity  in  improved \nagriculture and water management practices. The proposed project will modernize the Yavan and \n(priority components of) Kumsangir I&D systems in the Lower Vaksh river basin in Tajikistan.2 \nThe project impact is food security and people\u2019s access to good quality nutrition increased.  The \nproject outcome is performance of Yavan and Kumsangir I&D systems improved. This will be \nachieved with: (i) climate resilient and modernized I&D infrastructure to improve water use \nefficiency; (ii) inclusive and reliable on-farm water management (OFWM); and (iii) policy and \ninstitutions strengthened for sustainable I&D management, focusing on the Agency of Land \nReclamation and Irrigation (ALRI) and water users associations.3  \n \n2.  The project is estimated to cost $26 million. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \nfinance $25 million from its Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund). The Government \nof Tajikistan will provide $1 million through provision of counterpart staff, office space, exemptions \nof  taxes  and  duties,  access  to  information  and  data,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The \ntransaction technical assistance (TA) and the ensuing grant are included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The TA will support the government to prepare feasibility studies of the Yavan and (priority \ncomponents) of Kumsangir I&D systems. These studies will identify proposed interventions and \ninclude technical (engineering design) and environmental, social and economic and financial \nassessments.4 A TA grant of $1 million will be required to prepare the ensuing grant project. It will \nidentify  targeted  interventions  for  gender  empowerment  and  inclusion  in  I&D  modernization, \ndecision making and income generation. The TA will identify suitable interventions to be made for \nimproved  OFWM,  including  land  and  water  management  initiatives  and  application  of \ntechnologies, particularly for high value crops. It will also highlight areas for capacity building \nsupport in technical, procurement, financial management, etc., for ALRI.5 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  Output 1: Preparation of sector roadmap. This output will support strategic actions for \nsustainable I&D management in Tajikistan. The output will develop: (i) a methodology for I&D \nasset inventory and management in the Vaksh river basin; (ii) an approach for operation and \n \n1  World Bank. Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate) (accessed 22 July 2019).  \n2  The Kumsangir I&D system comprises three stages of pumping (with separate pumping stations), each with an \nassociated command area. The TA will focus on developing the priority stage of pumping as agreed with ALRI.  \n3  ALRI is the mandated agency for operation, maintenance and management of I&D systems and flood management \ninfrastructure. \n4  The TA will prepare advanced designs for main elements of I&D systems which will be sufficient for preparing bid \ndocuments and cost estimation to within a +/- 10% range. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 November 2019. \n \n ", "2 \nmaintenance cost rationalization which can be applied to I&D systems to improve cost estimation \nfor annual, periodic and emergency maintenance; and (iii) volumetric measurement of irrigation \nwater supplies, pricing and cost recovery mechanisms on a suitable area identified within Yavan \nor Kumsangir I&D systems.6 The output will also develop a gender sensitization program for ALRI \nand other relevant agencies (such as the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water \nResources). A multimedia knowledge product on women irrigators will be prepared as a capacity \nbuilding tool. A study tour to Australia for relevant government counterparts will strengthen \nunderstanding of modernized approaches to I&D management.7  \n \n5.  Output 2: Preparation of investment project. This output will develop Yavan and \n(priority  components  of)  Kumsangir  I&D  systems.  This  will  include:  (i)  topographic  and \ngeotechnical  surveys;  (ii)  feasibility-stage  engineering  design  for  I&D  modernization;  (iii) \ndevelopment of relevant on-farm interventions; (iv) targeted gender interventions to improve \nwomen\u2019s  access  to  knowledge,  skills  and  inputs  for  improved  agricultural  productivity  and \neconomic empowerment;8 (v) economic and financial analysis; (vi) preparation of financial and \nprocurement management due diligence and action plan; (vii) preparation of project safeguards \nin line with ADB and government requirements; (viii) preparation of sector assessment and \ndevelopment coordination report; (ix) preparation of project cost estimate, financing plan, risk \nassessment  and  management  plan,  gender  action  plan,  procurement  plan,  implementation \nschedule, implementation arrangements including role of ALRI and other stakeholders, and \ndesign and monitoring framework; (x) preparation of technical specifications and draft bidding \ndocuments  for  first  procurement  package;  and  (xi)  draft  documentation  for  ADB  Board \nconsideration and feasibility design report for internal government project approval as required.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n6.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u22126). The key expenditure items are in \nAppendix 1. \n \n7.  The government will provide counterpart support (the equivalent of $100,000) in the form \nof counterpart staff, office space, exemptions of taxes and duties, access to information and data, \nand other in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n8.  ADB will administer the TA. The TA will require 12 person-months of international and 6 \nperson-months  of  national  individual  consultants  for  developing  overall  project  design  and \nconducting due diligence, and a national firm for preparing  a feasibility study for selected \nsubprojects.  ADB\u2019s Central  and West  Asia  Department  will  select,  supervise  and  evaluate \nconsultants. The TA consultants will procure limited goods (para. 10). \n \n \n6  The World Bank is to undertake river basin planning of the Vaksh river.
