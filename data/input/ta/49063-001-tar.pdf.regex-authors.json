INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Pakistan has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Enabling  Economic  Corridors \nthrough Sustainable Transport Sector Development to help it meet its development goals of \nPakistan Vision 2025. The TA is part of the Pakistan Economic Corridors Programme (PECP), \nfinanced by the Government of the United Kingdom and jointly delivered by ADB and the \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID) to promote regional \ntrade and connectivity. Following a reconnaissance mission to Islamabad in February 2015 and \na follow-up consultation mission in June to July 2015, ADB and the government agreed on the \ngeneral impact, outcome, outputs, cost, financing arrangements, implementation arrangements, \nand terms of reference for consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s transport sector continues to suffer from inadequate transport infrastructure. \nThe inefficiency of the transport sector costs Pakistan\u2019s economy 4%\u20136% of gross domestic \nproduct  every  year.2 These  infrastructure  difficulties  continue  to  be  addressed  by  various \nprojects and programs financed by the government, ADB, and other development partners. \nHowever, there is a strong need to couple infrastructure investments with institutional and policy \nimprovements to resolve underlying structural issues that prevent Pakistan from developing the \ntransport sector in a coordinated, efficient, sustainable, and safe manner. These efforts are \nneeded to foster the development of economic corridors, which connect economic nodes in \nPakistan with each other, and with those in the region.   \n3.  Lack of a coherent transport policy and master plan. Responsibilities for planning \nand development of transport infrastructure are divided between ministries. Urban transport also \nremains uncoordinated, resulting in heavy congestion and long journey times. Investments are \nallocated to projects without sufficient attention to network integration and long- term strategic \ngoals. An overarching transport policy laying out the vision, objectives, and principles for the \nsector is needed to align the work of various federal, provincial, and municipal authorities. A \nmaster plan that prioritizes projects and integrates different modes according to the transport \npolicy is also needed. Pakistan has made several efforts in this regard, including the drafting in \n2008 of a national transport policy (NTP) by the Ministry of Communications with assistance \nfrom ADB, and several phases of work assisted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency \nto develop transport master plans. Such efforts have fallen short of being translated into official \npolicy, due in part to their overly ambitious scope and lack of buy-in from all stakeholders.   \n4.  Limited level of cross-border transport facilitation. Located at the crossroads of \nAfghanistan, Central Asia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and Iran, Pakistan has huge \npotential to become a hub for regional transport and trade. As a member of the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program, and following the priorities of the CAREC \nTransport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020, Pakistan is attempting to increase transit traffic \nwith its neighboring countries. For example, Pakistan has acceded to key international transport \nagreements  such  as  the  Convention  on  International  Transport  of  Goods  Under  Cover  of \nTransports Internationaux Routiers Carnets, and the Quadrilateral Traffic in Transit Agreement \nwith the PRC, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyz Republic. However, considerable challenges remain to \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 September 2015. The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Pakistan, 2015\u20132017 as Pakistan Economic Corridor \nProgram (Transport).  \n2 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2011. Pakistan Economic Survey 2010\u20132011. Islamabad. \n ", "2  \nfully operationalize such agreements. Border crossing point infrastructure is in poor condition, \nand customs and other procedures have yet to be harmonized with neighboring countries. \n5.  Poor condition of safety for all road users. The World Health Organization estimates \nthat about 30,000 persons were killed in road collisions in Pakistan in 2010.3 Prerequisites for \nsustained improvements in road safety include the establishment of a coordinated structure on \nroad safety across government ministries, high-level political support, data for monitoring and \ntarget setting, appropriate legislation, and capacity for enforcement. Pakistan is making efforts \nto address road safety. The creation of a specialized unit on the federal road network, the \nNational Highways & Motorway Police (NH&MP), has resulted in a significant reduction in the \nnumber of crashes. In 2010, efforts were made to develop a National Road Safety Council and \nits secretariat, consisting of all relevant authorities. These efforts, however, have fallen short of \nproviding a sustained improvement to road safety mainly due to lack of commitment at high \npolitical level, and lack of reliable funding for road safety institutions.  \n6.  Insufficient capacity to manage existing road assets. Road conditions in Pakistan \nare poor due to insufficient funding for road maintenance, chronic overloading of vehicles, and \nlack of road asset management systems to systematically plan and implement maintenance \nworks. The government has taken some important steps to address these issues. A road \nmaintenance account has been set up and is being replenished from tolls and the government\u2019s \nannual maintenance grant. The National Highway Authority (NHA) applies technically sound \npractice on RAM and determines maintenance needs every year. Despite these efforts, an \nestimated funding gap of about PRs10.0 billion per year for road maintenance remains, which \nequates to about one half of the total road maintenance financing needs. Roads managed by \nthe provincial governments are not yet subject to the same RAM practices as the NHA. NHA\u2019s \nfinancial state remains inadequate to attract resources to finance necessary road expenditures. \n7.  Addressing these constraints is important, especially since large investments in transport \ninfrastructure are expected in the coming few years, financed both by domestic funds as well as \ninternational  partners,  including  ADB.  The  NTP  and  master  plan  will  help  guide  these \ninvestments  according  to  a  consistent  policy  framework.  The  enhanced  capacity  of  the \ngovernment on transport facilitation, road safety, and asset management will ensure that these \ninvestments are more effective, safe, and sustainable. These investments, in turn, will improve \nthe  competitiveness  of  the  country\u2019s  exports  and  internal  trade,  reduce  the  cost  of  doing \nbusiness,  enhance  Pakistan\u2019s  capability  to  integrate  into  global  supply  chains,  and  foster \neconomic corridors within Pakistan and with neighboring countries. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be a coordinated, efficient, safe, and sustainable transport system in \nPakistan, supporting Pakistan\u2019s Vision 2025, and the objectives of the PECP. The outcome will \nbe improved capacity of the government to develop and manage its transport system in a \ncoordinated, efficient, safe, and sustainable manner. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  To achieve the impact and outcome of the TA, four outputs will be delivered. \n                                                \n3 This equates to 17.4 deaths per 100,000 population, which is comparable to Afghanistan and India. Countries with \nextensive road safety measures have a much lower rate, for example 3.7 in the United Kingdom.  ", "  3\n10.  Output 1: National transport policy and master plan developed. A holistic NTP \ncovering all modes of transport will be developed containing, among others, (i) an assessment \nof the current and future transport patterns and needs; (ii) a guiding vision, principles, and \nobjectives for the sector; and (iii) an assessment of and strategies for addressing institutional, \nfinancial,  and  technological  constraints.  The  NTP  will  provide  certainty  to  private  sector \ninvestors,  and  promote  economic  corridor  development  by  linking  transport  infrastructure \ninvestments with the needs of economic agents. An accompanying master plan will also be \ndeveloped, consisting of a prioritized set of projects in line with the NTP. To achieve this output, \nall  existing  efforts  by  the  government  and  development  partners  will  be  assessed,  and \nconsensus-building workshops held. Based on these discussions, the NTP and master plan will \nbe fully developed for adoption by the cabinet. Detailed subsector and thematic policies and \nplans will then be formulated or improved, including provision for equitable tolling. A national \ntransport data observatory will also be developed to support evidence-based policy making and \nto conduct periodic monitoring and evaluation of the NTP and master plan. \n11.  Output 2: Multimodal transport facilitated within Pakistan and with its neighboring \ncountries. The TA will support the effective implementation of the Transports Internationaux \nRoutiers  Convention  and  other  international  transport  agreements  to  which  Pakistan  is  a \nsignatory. It will also prepare the country for accession to other key agreements such as the \nConvention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road. For this purpose, \nthe TA will first scope the needs and potential of Pakistan to increase traffic in transit with \nneighboring countries. This will be followed by capacity building of relevant government staff \nand private sector stakeholders on international transport agreements. Furthermore, the TA will \nidentify key bottlenecks in infrastructure that limit multimodal transport facilitation, and prepare \nprefeasibility  studies  for  new  projects  to  alleviate  such  infrastructure  bottlenecks.  This  will \ncomplement other efforts by the government, ADB, and other development partners, including \nthe rehabilitation and construction of regional corridors and border crossing points designated \nunder the CAREC program. \n12.  Output 3: National road safety program implemented. The TA will support Pakistan \nto improve the safety of its road network through a holistic set of measures addressing (i) road \nsafety  management  systems,  (ii)  road  user  behavior,  (iii)  infrastructure  improvements,  (iv) \nvehicle improvements, and (v) post-crash response. An interministerial body will be set up to \ncoordinate activities to improve road safety, and a national road safety action plan will be \ndeveloped.  The  TA  will  support  awareness-raising  campaigns  and  training  of  enforcement \nofficials. The TA will also support the government to review road standards for all classes of \nroads  from  a  road  safety  angle.  The  revised  standards  will  be  piloted  through  equipment \nprocured under the TA. The TA will support the government in drafting national guidelines on \nvehicle and driver licenses, as well as post-crash response. \n13.  Output 4: National road asset management system made functional. The TA will \nsupport the government in solving the causes of road deterioration, and scaling up resources for \nroad maintenance across Pakistan. The TA will procure equipment and software needed to \nperform road asset management to a higher standard, and to improve the budgeting process for \nroad maintenance. Training on the use of such equipment and software will also be provided. \nTogether with NHA staff, the TA will conduct outreach and training sessions to provinces on the \nprinciples of RAM for replication at provincial level. The TA will also work with the NH&MP and \nNHA to enforce rules on overloading on the national highway and motorway network. The TA \nwill also help create mechanisms for increased allocation of funding toward road maintenance, \ne.g., through the further allocation of vehicle user fees and taxes for road maintenance. The TA \nwill improve the financial viability and sustainability of the NHA, by assessing the underlying \n ", "4  \nreasons behind the inadequate financial standing of the NHA, and preparing a detailed plan for \nthe financial restructuring of its balance sheet. The TA will support the implementation of actions \nidentified in this plan. \n14.  A risk in carrying out the above activities is that stakeholder consultation (at provincial \nlevel and between government agencies) takes time and could delay TA outputs. Changes in \ngovernment can reduce commitment to the TA and its outputs at high level. Other issues, such \nas energy and security, may prevent stakeholders from investing time and effort in transport \nsector priorities. Government ownership of TA outputs may not be sustained over time. These \nrisks will be mitigated by adopting lessons from other ADB projects in Pakistan and in other \ncountries, including close engagement with the government throughout the TA implementation. \nThe TA will benefit from the high level of government ownership of the proposed activities, as \nwitnessed through the formation of a unit in the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform \ndedicated to integrated transport infrastructure planning, and recent efforts by the Ministry of \nCommunication to reconvene the National Road Safety Council.   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $16,406,266 equivalent, of which $15,406,266 (\u00a39,809,160) \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom, acting through \nDFID. The memorandum of understanding between DFID and ADB confirming these funds was \nsigned on 25 June 2015. TA funds will be administered by ADB. The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of staff, logistics support, office accommodation, and other in-\nkind contributions. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Ministry of Planning, Development, and Reform will be the executing agency for the \nNTP and master plan, as well as the multimodal transport facilitation components of the TA. It \nwill  liaise  closely  with  Pakistani  authorities,  including  but  not  limited  to  (i)  Ministry  of \nCommunications for road transport, (ii) Ministry of Railways for rail transport, (iii) Ministry of \nPorts and Shipping for maritime transport, (iv) Cabinet Secretariat and/or Civil Aviation Authority \nfor air transport, and (v) Federal Board of Revenue on issues relating to transport and trade \nfacilitation. Coordination with provincial governments will be facilitated through the established \nchannels and procedures of the Ministry of Planning, Development, and Reform. \n17.  The executing agency for the road asset management and road safety components will \nbe the Ministry of Communications, which is the ministry in charge of the NHA, NH&MP, and \nNational Transport Research Center. The road safety component will be jointly implemented by \nNHA (on aspects relating to safe roads), NH&MP (on aspects related to enforcement) and \nNational Transport Research Center (on aspects related to research and development). The \nroad asset management component is expected to be implemented primarily by the NHA\u2019s \nDirectorate for Road Asset Management. There will be close consultation with the Ministry of \nFinance and other relevant authorities regarding funding of road maintenance. \n18.  TA activities will be guided by a steering committee, suggested to be convened by the \nsecretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning,  Development,  and  Reform  and  including  high-level \nrepresentatives of the ministries of Communications, Finance, Railways, Ports and Shipping, \nCabinet Secretariat, Industry, Commerce, and Climate Change. The government will provide \ntechnical  staff  and  experts  from  relevant  institutions  including  but  not  limited  to  the  NHA, \nNH&MP, and the National Transport Research Center to join the core implementation team of \nthe TA. They will work jointly with, and assist ADB staff and TA consultants by providing access ", "  5\nto existing data, publications, etc.; collecting data in support of the TA implementation; and \ntaking part in the communication and dissemination of the TA activities and outputs.  \n19.  Research agencies, universities, and private transport associations are expected to take \npart in the implementation of the TA. Their roles may include (i) providing data on transport and \ntrade, (ii) conducting assessments of transport user needs, and (iii) facilitating dissemination \nand outreach of TA outputs. Involvement of such organizations will be subject to government \nclearance, and through consultant contracts (sector specialists or resource persons), letters of \nintent,  or  memoranda  of  understanding  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  organization  and \nengagement. \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 4 years and 4 months, from December 2015 to March \n2020. The TA activities will require a combined 738 person-months of consultant services \n(international, 322 person-months; national, 416 person-months). An international firm will be \nmobilized to support TA activities on the NTP and master plan, while another will support the \nnational road safety program. In addition, a group of firms will be mobilized through an indefinite \ndelivery contract to carry out prefeasibility studies of specific projects that may ensue from the \nNTP and master plan. Additional sector specialists and resource persons may be recruited on \nan individual basis based on need. Appendix 3 provides an outline of consultants\u2019 terms of \nreference. The TA will be administered by the Transport and Communications Division of the \nCentral and West Asia Department, who will be responsible for the financial management \nfunctions including budgeting, disbursements, and internal control over receipts and payments. \nThe Pakistan Resident Mission will closely support the implementation of the TA. \n21.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Procurement will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the TA \nwill be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  in  alignment  with  procedures  set  within  the \nmemorandum of understanding between DFID and ADB on the PECP. \n22.  The TA will be monitored at least on a quarterly basis using established ADB procedures \nand DFID\u2019s delivery plan for the PECP and associated tools for monitoring and reporting. \nCorrective measures will be taken should such monitoring and reporting find impediments to the \nimplementation of the TA. Evaluation and financial audit of the TA will equally follow both ADB \nand  DFID  procedures,  as  outlined  in  the  aforementioned  memorandum  of  understanding \nbetween DFID and ADB. \n23.  Good  practices  and  lessons  from  TA  activities  will  be  disseminated  across  the \ngovernment (including all provinces) through existing and new channels to be set up by the TA. \nSimilarly, efforts will be undertaken to disseminate findings to the international development \ncommunity, through  established knowledge  networks  such  as the  Multilateral  Development \nBanks\u2019 Working Group on Sustainable Transport, and the Partnership on Sustainable Low \nCarbon Transport. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n24.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $15,406,266 to the Government of Pakistan to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for Enabling Economic \nCorridors through Sustainable Transport Sector Development. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nA coordinated, efficient, safe, and sustainable transport system in Pakistan, in support of realizing \nPakistan\u2019s Vision 2025 and the objectives of the Pakistan Economic Corridors Programme (Pakistan \nVision 2025, 2014).a \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020     \nImproved capacity of  a.
