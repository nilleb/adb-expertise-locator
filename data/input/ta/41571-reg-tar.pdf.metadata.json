The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the governments of Mongolia and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) intensified a dialogue in 2006 on the need to add value to their \ndevelopment and economic expansion by strengthening the role of knowledge and innovation in \ntheir country programs. Since then, the ADB has taken systematic steps to place knowledge \nmanagement,  and  the  creation,  improvement,  and  expansion  of  knowledge  products  and \nservices  (KPS)1 in  the  mainstream  of  Mongolia  and  PRC  operations.  The  aim  is  to  help \ncountries respond effectively and fully to the crucial importance of knowledge in accelerating \neconomic development, and to plan and implement ways to enhance their knowledge resources. \nADB\u2019s East Asia Department has established a knowledge management unit and adopted a \nsystem of KPS programming and implementation. Improving knowledge products has become a \nkey result area.  \n2.  In 2007, ADB and the PRC embraced knowledge and innovation as a core theme in the \ndraft country partnership strategy (CPS). During the Country Programming Midterm Review \nMission, held from 10 to 13 April 2007 in Beijing, the Government of the PRC welcomed the \nstrengthened  emphasis  on  KPS  as  an  important  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  program.  The \nGovernment  of  Mongolia  shares  ADB\u2019s  view  of  the  importance  of  knowledge  in  attaining \nsustainable  development.  The  country  strategy  and  program  update  (CSPU)2 for  Mongolia \n(2007\u20132009)  supports  a  focused  strategic  approach  to  knowledge  through  its  non-lending \nprogram, with emphasis on institutional organization, efficiency of public service delivery, better \ncoordination and monitoring, and strengthened results. The Fact-Finding Mission, conducted \nfrom  20  to  27  August  2007,  reached  agreement  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  and \nimplementation arrangements for the proposed TA.3 The TA design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  A trend that began in national economies in the early 20th century continues today\u2014\nincreasingly greater value is being created from services than from industry or agriculture.4 The \ncreation of value, whether economic or social, is being achieved through knowledge. National \neconomies  are  becoming  more  knowledge-based,5 especially  in  terms  of  productivity  and \ngrowth. Leveraging information more effectively is especially important to improving productivity. \nEconomic  competitiveness  now  depends  on  the  ability  to  transform  vast  quantities  of \ninformation  into  useable  knowledge,  and  to  deploy  that  knowledge  effectively  across \norganizations, market ecosystems, and economies. ADB has suggested that the pillars of a \nknowledge-based  economy  are:  (i) education,  including  a  skilled  work  force;  (ii)  national \ninnovation  systems  in  the  fields  of  science,  technology,  research,  and  development; \n(iii) networks, including information and communication technology infrastructure, and social \nnetworks; and (iv) a suitable policy and regulatory environment. ADB builds these pillars through \nloan-related knowledge transfers that include (i) innovative designs; (ii) introduction of new \ntechnologies,  and  the  best  practices  embodied  in  ADB  lending  and  technical  assistance; \n(iii) policy research work by ADB staff; and (iv) sharing development experience in the region.  \n                                                \n1  Knowledge products and services (KPS) are analytical work such as sector studies, thematic assessments (e.g., \npoverty, gender), policy analysis, project preparatory work, country economic reports, and evaluation reports.  \n2  ADB. 2006.

Moving Toward Knowledge-Based Economies: Asian Experiences. Manila. \n5  The  knowledge-based  economy  is  a  larger  concept  than  just  an  increased  commitment  to  research  and \ndevelopment. It covers every aspect of the contemporary economy, where knowledge is at the heart of value \nadded from high tech manufacturing. European Union Lisbon report chaired by Prime Minister Wim Kok, 2004. ", "2\n4.  The  government  and  nongovernment  think  tanks  and  private  research  institutes  in \nMongolia, are not well developed. They have limited experience and resources, and cannot \nprovide competent policy briefs to the Government. Government research institutions lack top-\nquality  personnel  and  modern  management  systems.  Because  professors  have  had  more \ntraining abroad, the capacity is better at the country\u2019s universities. Their policy research work is \noften  too  theoretical  to  meet  government  needs,  however,  and  they  need  to  expand  and \nimprove applied research methodologies so they can respond to the large demand for policy \nanalysis. In the PRC, the Government recognizes that policy research is a priority. ADB has \ntraditionally focused on projects, and the PRC has accumulated a lot of project management \nexperience. What the PRC needs now is more support for its policy response capacity. That \nrequires examining the lessons learned in the developed economies, as well as a greater \nunderstanding of the constraints and conditions unique to the PRC. KPS in the PRC should be \ncomplemented by high-level dialogues through strategic conferences, seminars, workshops, \nand training. These will produce cross-fertilization of ideas across groups and disciplines, and \nhelp disseminate outcomes to broader audiences.  \n5.  In the past, requirements for knowledge in ADB operations in Mongolia and the PRC \nwere  met  mainly  through  advisory  technical  assistance,  regional  technical  assistance,  and \neconomic, thematic, and sector work done by ADB staff to address priority issues. PRC-specific \ntechnical  assistance  facilities6 were  also  established  as  flexible,  quick-response  funding \nmechanisms for policy-oriented KPS needed to address emerging government priorities when a \nnew TA would be impractical or too slow. New components could be identified at a later stage of \nTA implementation, thus improving results.  \n6.  Other TAs involving several ADB departments have had direct knowledge or policy-\nresearch  objectives.7 Themes  have  included  PRC-India  policy  collaboration,  strengthening \nresearch networking in South Asia, establishing knowledge hubs in East and Central Asia\u2014on \ntopics such as energy, environment, and regional transport and trade\u2014and knowledge sharing \nand  learning  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  in  Asia.  An  ADB evaluation  study8 noted  that, \nalthough the vast majority of advisory technical assistance projects are rated satisfactory, they \nare not being used to their full advantage. ADB\u2019s existing knowledge management framework \nstops short of (i) developing processes for extraction of value-added materials, (ii) developing \nknowledge products that provide new analytical insights, and (iii) developing feasible reform \noptions. Lessons learned from earlier knowledge-oriented TAs point to the need to respond to \ngovernment  requests  on  emerging  issues,  to  coordinate  and  communicate  across  a  large \nnumber of government and nongovernment agencies, and to disseminate knowledge effectively \nas it is generated. \n7.  Based on these requirements and experiences, Mongolia and the PRC agree that a \nmechanism is needed to develop\u2014or create the capacity to develop\u2014strategic KPS that can \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2003.

It should also support the sharing of ideas between Mongolia and the PRC \nand the dissemination of KPS through appropriate networks that include government, academic, \nand other research institutes. More interaction among Mongolia, the PRC, and regional experts, \nand wider distribution of research findings and policy applications, in Mongolia and the PRC, will \nhelp  the  countries  in  their  pursuit  of  knowledge-based  economies.  By  providing  KPS  and \nhelping them build their capacity to create KPS, ADB will be their knowledge partner in this \neffort.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  more  effective  policy  development,  coordination,  and \ngovernment decision-making in Mongolia and the PRC, based on the expansion and application \nof quality research. The TA will help develop policy and sector reforms that are consistent with \nkey areas9 of the CPS or CSPU. The outcome will be increased strategic policy dialogue, more \nresearch  and  access  to  development  knowledge,  and  greater  collaboration  among  the \ngovernment agencies and think tanks.10 The TA will serve as a facility for ADB to respond \nquickly to KPS requests from Mongolia and the PRC, and to be proactive in informing decision \nmakers  on  emerging  strategic  policy  issues  and  in  disseminating  research  findings  and \nknowledge more widely.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The key outputs will be: (i) studies and applied research publications, including policy \nnotes, technical papers, good-practices studies, sector and thematic reports, and other special \npublications or flagship studies; (ii) translations of KPS into Mongolian, Chinese, and other \nlanguages,  as  required;  (iii)  electronic  databases,  websites,  and  other  internet-related \ndissemination  work;  (iv)  high-level conferences,  seminars,  workshops,  training,  and  other \nmeetings; (v) increased interaction on development issues affecting Mongolia and the PRC \namong  both  regional  and  domestic  research  institutions  and  experts;  (vi)  publication  and \ndissemination of existing and new KPS based on user demand and needs; (vii) strengthened in-\nhouse  ADB  capacity  to  provide  high-level  policy  advice  to  Mongolia  and  the  PRC;  and \n(viii) other activities supporting the development, management, and sharing of knowledge. TA \nactivities will be overseen by ADB, in coordination with the ministries of finance in Mongolia and \nthe PRC. In response to emerging KPS needs and the country situations, Mongolia, the PRC, \nand ADB may be flexible in choosing activities from the three components over the course of \nthe TA.\n10. Component 1: Strategic Knowledge Products. The governments of Mongolia and the \nPRC, with ADB, will identify strategic development issues to be given priority for research. \nThese issues will be consistent with the goals of the CSPU and eventual CPS for Mongolia, and \nthe CPS for the PRC, and have the potential to promote and raise awareness of knowledge and \ninnovation. In Mongolia, for example, topics could relate to ADB\u2019s traditional focus\u2014health, \neducation,  and  road  transport\u2014but,  to  demonstrate  innovation,  also  involve  study  of  the \npractical applications of such research on town-based urbanization and in facilitating regional \ntrade. In the PRC, the focus could move beyond road and railway transportation, energy, \nagriculture,  and  regional  cooperation,  to  examine  new  financing  modalities  for  rural \n                                                \n9  For  example,  areas  include  (i)  inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  (ii)  resource  efficiency  and \nenvironmental sustainability, (iii) regional cooperation and public goods, and (iv) enabling environment for private \nsector development. \n10 Academia, research institutes, nongovernment organizations, and government research facilities. ", "4\ndevelopment and energy savings. The component will include funding for the professional \nservices of domestic and international experts who undertake research, and for the logistics \nrelated to the work of these experts and ADB staff. Also included will be funds for editing, \ntranslating, printing, and publishing (i) new KPS produced under this TA, (ii) KPS developed in-\nhouse by ADB staff, (iii) KPS created under staff consultancies, and (iv) KPS produced under \nother past or current ADB-funded TA projects that may require additional expenditures for use \nby Mongolia and the PRC\u2014the cost, for example, of reprinting an ADB publication for which no \nfurther resources are available under the TA that first funded it.  \n11. Component 2: Research Capacity Planning and Building. The TA will develop plans \nfor creating the capacity for applied research within a government agency, a university, a \nresearch  institution,  a  nongovernment  institution,  or  ADB,  and  include  training  and  other \nactivities to help build this in-house capacity. In Mongolia, for example, this could involve the \ndesign of a master plan, including a resources scheme, to establish the capacity for policy \nresearch within the Ministry of Finance (MOF.) The strengthening of policy analysis at the MOF \ncould  complement  a  project  under  consideration  by  The  Asia  Foundation  to  support  an \nindependent  think  tank  in  Mongolia  capable  of  providing  policy  briefs  requested  by  the \nGovernment and other stakeholders. Given the PRC\u2019s relative strength in research capacity, \nthis component is expected to concentrate on Mongolia. Specialized capacity-building activities \nfor the PRC could, however, also be considered. They could include developing research hubs \nfor a strategic sector like energy savings. The TA will also support capacity- building activities to \nenable ADB staff to provide more effective KPS to Mongolia and the PRC. \n12. Component 3: Knowledge Sharing and Research Networking. This component will \nprovide funds for publicizing and disseminating KPS developed under components 1 and 2. It \nwill also support research networking activities. This will be accomplished largely through high-\nlevel  conferences,  seminars,  workshops,  focus  groups,  training,  and  other  meetings,  and \nthrough the use of eminent independent experts and think tanks. A main goal of these activities \nis cross-fertilization of ideas across groups and disciplines.11 Networks of government and \nnongovernment research institutes will likely be convened to discuss and debate policies related \nto  specific  sectors  or  themes.  Given  limited  funds,  the  TA  may  concentrate  initially  on \nnetworking between each nation\u2019s MOF and the research arms of its other ministries, and \nbetween these research arms and think tanks on those subjects in which MOF requests help. \nThis component also includes (i) internet dissemination work, (ii) innovative modes of sharing \nknowledge  among  all  stakeholders  in  the  subregion,  (iii)  support  for  development  of  an \nelectronic sectoral and thematic database in Mongolia and the PRC, and (iv) identifying the \nmost qualified institutions and experts to carry out KPS activities. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $1,000,000. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA cost estimate is based on engagement \nof international and domestic experts; support for editing, translation, and printing of KPS; and \nassociated  networking  and  knowledge  sharing\u2014e.g.,  conferences,  seminars,  workshops, \ntraining\u2014including  rental  of  facilities  for  policy  dialogue  and  consultations,  interpretation, \nequipment, transport and lodging, photocopying, logistical and administrative costs, website \ndevelopment, electronic databases, and other costs related to dissemination work. The detailed \ncost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n                                                \n11 For example, a conference in the PRC bringing together provinces to discuss national road sector policy would be \na suitable activity. ", "5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA, with ADB\u2019s East Asia Department, Office of \nthe Director General, working in collaboration with the respective MOFs of Mongolia and the \nPRC, which will be the implementing agencies for KPS topic selection, under arrangements to \nbe agreed upon with ADB. Steering committees in Mongolia and the PRC will be established \nunder the regional technical assistance, comprising key government ministries, think tanks, and \nADB, to conduct quarterly meetings to identify priority policy issues, research requirements, and \nprominent scholars. Invitations will be issued to research institutions, visiting professors, and \npractitioners,  to  present  proposals  for  studies.  In  Mongolia,  the  steering  committee,  in \ncooperation with the economic policy advisor to the Prime Minister, will prepare an annual list of \npotential research topics to facilitate research work. In the PRC, there will also be an annual \nmeeting, following the National People\u2019s Congress in March, to identify the emerging issues that \nneed attention.\n15.  A  Working  Group  will  be  established  for  the  TA  within  ADB  to  advise  ADB\u2019s \nrepresentative on the Mongolia and PRC steering committees on proposed KPS initiatives and \nto approve logistical expenses related to KPS production and dissemination.12 The Working \nGroup will develop and approve the ADB dissemination plan for KPS produced under the TA, \nand for KPS produced in-house by ADB staff or under other TAs and staff consultancies. The \ndissemination plan will identify the types, formats, and numbers of publications needed, the \naudiences, and the public relations activities. This plan will be coordinated with those developed \nby the Mongolia and PRC steering committees. \n16.  Steering  committees  will  screen  all  KPS  proposals,  following  agreed  criteria  and \napplication  processes.  KPS  proposals  will  be  capped  at  $100,000,  unless  ADB  and  the \nimplementing agencies agree to waive this ceiling for a proposal. Depending on the activity, \nfunds will be disbursed by ADB through either the Executing Agency or the implementing \nagencies, which will liquidate expenses to ADB. Advance payment facilities will be established \nbecause many studies and conferences require funds in advance.  \n17.  As the TA will be designed to flexibly address government requests over a two-year \nperiod, starting from February 2008 to January 2010, consulting services will be determined on \na case-by-case basis for each activity. The consultants13 will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Proposals \nthat provide honoraria to experts for KPS activities will use a competitive selection process \nacceptable to ADB whereby at least three individuals are evaluated according to educational \nbackground and relevant experience. Indicative roles for experts are described in Appendix 3. \nTA activities will be monitored and reports made available through the ADB website.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Supporting Strategic Knowledge Products and Research Networking, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                \n12 Logistical expenses for KPS and support for ADB in-house KPS activities will be approved by the ADB Working \nGroup, not by the steering committees.  \n13 Consultants could be individuals or institutions, and could include think tanks, academic institutions, research \ninstitutes, nongovernment organizations, and government research facilities.
