During formulation of the 2003 Country Strategy and Program for the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC), the Government requested that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide \nassistance to reforms at the provincial level. Since then, two technical assistance (TA) projects \nwere approved to assist Hebei province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, respectively, \nin formulating provincial development strategies. Encouraged by the successful implementation \nof TA 3970 Hebei Provincial Development Strategy, the Government requested that  ADB \ndevelop a  systematic approach in helping the reforms at  provincial level.  TA on provincial \ndevelopment strategy was proposed during the 2004 Country Programming Mission.1 An ADB \nfact-finding mission2 visited Xinjiang in June 2005, and a Gansu government delegation visited \nBeijing  in  October  2005.  An agreement  was reached  on the TA\u2019s scope, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, terms of reference for consulting services, and implementation arrangements \nwith the provincial governments and Ministry of Finance (MOF).3 Appendix 1 gives the technical \nassistance framework for the TA.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.   The Country Strategy and Program Update 2006\u20132008, issued in 2005, suggests that \nADB should  increase its direct policy dialogue with provincial authorities and allocate more \nknowledge-based products to the provincial level. While numerous reforms have been adopted \nat the national and sector levels,  many reform initiatives, as well as  the responsibilities for \nimplementing those reforms, remain to be addressed at the provincial and local government \nlevels.  Further,  most  ADB  loan  projects  have  been  (and  likely  will  be)  proposed  and \nimplemented by local governments.  Recognizing this, ADB has in recent months conducted \npolicy dialogue at the provincial level. This has been well received by the provinces concerned.   \n \n3.  While provincial governments are good in designing investment projects,  there is still \nlack  of  capacity  in  developing  integrated  socioeconomic  development  strategies.  After \ncontinuous decentralization in the past two decades and fiscal separation in the past 10 years, \nprovincial governments now must use their scarce resources more efficiently, deliver needed \npublic services as assigned by the central Government, and promote provincial socioeconomic \ndevelopment. To achieve  all of this together, provincial governments need to formulate  their \nown development strategies. They cannot just follow instructions from the central Government, \nas they did during the  planned economy  era. In this regard, many  provinces need external \nassistance in formulating balanced social and economic development strategies.   \n \n4.  The first pilot assistance project (TA) was provided to Hebei province in 2003. The TA \nreports were well received by the province and served as the main reference for the Provincial \n11th Five-Year Plan. One of the sector reports, the study on poverty belt surrounding Beijing \nand Tianjin attracted considerable attention from the central Government and news media. This \nTA was selected jointly by MOF and ADB as one of the five best TAs among more than 40 TAs \nimplemented during 2000\u20132004. Encouraged by the Hebei TA, a new study was begun in 2004 \nto formulate an energy economy strategy for Inner Mongolia. Since then, five provinces in the \nWestern  Region  and  three  provinces  in  the  Central  Region\u2014including  Xinjiang  Uyghur \n                                                 \n1  This TA was first included in the 2005 TA program during the 2004 Country Programming Mission. However, due to \nbudget cutting in March 2005, the TA was excluded from the 2005 TA program and delayed until 2006. Upon the \nGovernment\u2019s strongu rging, it was re-included in the 2005 TA program in August 2005. \n2  The mission comprised Long Yun Peng, team leader, economics officer of the People's Republic of China Resident \nMission. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 26 September 2005. ", "2 \nAutonomous Region (Xinjiang), Gansu province (Gansu), Qinghai province (Qinghai), Ningxia \nHui  Autonomous  Region  (Ningxia),  Yunnan  province  (Yunnan),  Hunan  province,  Jiangxi \nprovince, and Anhui province\u2014submitted proposals to MOF requesting that ADB provide similar \nassistance. During the  country programming missions  in 2004 and 2005, ADB  confirmed its \ncommitment  to  assist  in  formulating  provincial  development  strategies  and  to  have  direct \ndialogue  with  provincial  governments  in  order  to  deepen  the  policy  impact  and  improve \neffectiveness of ADB\u2019s operations . \n \n5.  The northwest region, which is home to many of the country\u2019sp oor and many ethnic \nminorities, has not benefited as much as have the coastal regions from rapid economic growth \nand reforms. The average per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in the interior regions is \nonly CNY8,364 ($1,036 equivalent), or about 38% of that in the coastal regions. Generally, the \ninstitutional capacities of coastal provinces are stronger than are those of interior provinces, and \ncoastal provinces have much better investment climates. Environmental issues, such as land \ndegradation, desertification, soil erosion, and water resource management, are more severe in \ncentral and western PRC. There is also a wide regional gap in the development of physical \ninfrastructure, including roads, railways, power, telecommunications, and water supply. An ADB \nbusiness climate survey in 2002 found that about 39% of foreign companies operating in the \nPRC would not consider expanding their operations into the interior provinces.4 The lack of \nconsumer markets and poor infrastructure were the two  reasons most frequently cited. To \naddress these challenges, the Government launched its Western Region Development Strategy \nin 1999. The current focus is on improving infrastructure,  preserving the  environment, and \nencouraging private sector investment. \n \n6.  To support the Western  Regional Development Strategy, ADB  in 2002  helped the \nNational Development and Reform Commission formulate a long-term strategy for the Western \nRegion. An ADB report5 recommended that the Western Region Development Strategy should \nfocus on (i) accelerating infrastructure development (transportation, communications, power, \nand water resources) to lay a foundation for development; (ii) reducing poverty by enhancing \nsustainable agriculture and husbandry and carrying out poverty alleviation programs in both \nrural  and  urban  areas;  (iii)  improving  the  environment  and  managing  natural  resources \neffectively and efficiently; (iv) upgrading technology; (v) strengthening education and training; (vi) \nmobilizing funds from domestic resources, as well as from concessional and nonconcessional \nassistance from bilateral and multilateral agencies; (vii) promoting domestic and foreign private \nsector investment in the region; and (viii) promoting regional cooperation with neighboring \ncountries.  \n \n7.  Addressing regional disparities is ADB\u2019s priority, as identified in the Country Strategy \nand  Program  2004\u20132006.  The  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  2005\u20132007  had \nsuggested that over 80% of the lending be allocated to the poorer inland provinces. ADB also \npromises to provide these provinces knowledge-based products to help address policy issues \nrelated to inclusive economic growth, poverty reduction, social development, and governance.  \n \n8.  The western provinces have the lowest income,  a polluted environment, and poor \ninfrastructure. They very much lag behind in social development indicators. Based on ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and the Government\u2019s strong request, this TA will be provided to two western \nprovinces. Among the five proposals received from the Western Region, those of Xinjiang and \nGansu have been selected for this assistance. Each of these two provinces has (i) developed a \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2003. Private Sector Assessment in the People\u2019s Republic of China.

Xinjiang covers 1.66 million square kilometers (km2), and its population is 19.63 million. \nIts average per capita GDP was CNY11,199 in 2004, which is around the national average of \nCNY10,561. Of 86 counties, 27 are national poverty counties. In 2004, about 2.59 million people, \nrepresenting more than 20% of Xinjiang\u2019s rural population,l ived on incomes below the official \npoverty line.6 By comparison, the PRC\u2019s antional average incidence of poverty is 3%. Xinjiang \nshares borders with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan. It is abundantly endowed with \nnatural resources. Considering its advantages, Xinjiang\u2019s development strategy will focus on the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program, and, in particular,  on its \npotential role in, and contribution to, that program.  \n \n10.  Gansu has a land area of 425,800 km2, and its population is 26.19 million. Its average \nper capita GDP was CNY5,970 in 2004, lower than the national average of CNY10,561. Of 86 \ncounties, 43 are national poverty counties. In 2004, about 1.6 million people, or 8.5% of its rural \npopulation, lived below the official poverty line. In addition to its lagging economy and huge poor \npopulation, Gansu also faces environmental challenges. Two thirds of its territory is made up of \nmountainous areas, plateau, and desert that is severely short of water. Gansu is, however, rich \nin  natural  resources  and  has  relatively  developed  raw  material  industries.  The  province\u2019s \ndevelopment strategy will address issues of balancing social, economic, and environmental \ndevelopment.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The objective of the proposed TA is to assist the governments of Xinjiang and Gansu to \nformulate their development strategies. This will ultimately help both the provinces achieve \nsustainable and balanced socioeconomic development while allowing the poor to benefit more \nfrom that development. The TA will comprise two parts. Part A is the Xinjian Development \nStrategy and part B is the Gansu Development Strategy.  \nB.    Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n12.  Part A: Xinjiang Development Strategy. Part A aims to help formulate a development \nstrategy for the government of Xinjiang to further improve its cooperation with the Central Asian \nrepublics (CARs) and promote sustainable socioeconomic development in Xinjiang.  \n \n13.   The key activities of Part A include (i) identifying areas for strengthening economic \ncooperation between Xinjiang and the CARs; (ii) analyzing key constraints and problems that \nhinder  participation  in  CAREC;  (iii)  analyzing  Xinjiang\u2019s  role  in  strengthening  economic \ncooperation between the other provinces of  the PRC and the  CARs; (iv)  identifying the key \nissues impeding sustainable socioeconomic development, and in particular those related to \npoverty reduction and rural development; (v) providing policy recommendations to the central \nand  Xinjiang  governments  for  strengthening  CAREC  and  sustainable  socioeconomic \ndevelopment; (vi) identifying the intervention areas  in which multilateral development banks \n                                                 \n6  PRC\u2019s official poverty line of CNY658 per capita per year is low compared with international rates.  \n ", "4 \n(and ADB in particular)  can play roles; and (vii) proposing projects for ADB to finance in \nXingjiang. \n \n14.  Part B: Gansu Development Strategy. Part B aims to help formulate a development \nstrategy  for  the  government  of  Gansu  in  order  to  achieve  sustainable  and  balanced \nsocioeconomic development and  help the poor to benefit more from  that development. This \nstrategy will put greater emphasis on social development, environmental protection, and poverty \nreduction.   \n \n15.  The key activities of Part B include (i) formulating an overall strategy for building upon \nthe province\u2019s advantages ando vercoming its disadvantages; (ii) designing integrated policies \nand action plans for social and economic development as well as environmental protection; (iii) \ndesigning a fiscal transfer system to strengthen the development capacity of the poor counties \nand villages; (iv) identifying structural reforms and future directions for developing traditional \nindustries and reforming state-owned enterprises; (v) formulating policies and action plans for \npromoting private sector development, urbanization, agricultural productivity improvement, and \nrural development; (vi) identifying those intervention areas  in which multilateral development \nbanks (and ADB in particular) can play roles; and (vii) proposing projects for ADB to finance in \nGansu. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.   The cost of the TA is estimated at $1,260,000 equivalent. ADB will provide a grant of \n$1,000,000 equivalent. Part A will be allocated $500,000 equivalent, and Part B $500,000. The \nGovernment will finance the  remaining $260,000 equivalent  by  providing  counterpart  staff, \nworkshop facilities, and logistical support. This TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. Appendix 2 provides cost estimates and the financing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.   The executing agencies for parts A and B, respectively, will be the Xinjiang Finance \nDepartment and the Gansu Finance Department. A work group, led in each province by a vice \ngovernor and consisting of senior officials from various government agencies, including the \nProvincial Development and Reform Commission, will provide guidance and assistance to the \nconsultant  team.  The  Xinjiang  and  Gansu  finance  departments  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating with various departments in the provinces to implement, monitor, and review the \nstudy\u2019sf indings. They will provide office facilities, in-city transportation, counterpart staff, and \naccess to all relevant information and data.   \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, beginning in  April 2006 and ending in \nOctober 2007. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for \nProcurement.7 Two domestic consulting firms with  associated foreign consulting firms will be \nselected to undertake the TA using quality and cost-based selection. A simplified technical \nproposal will be required.  The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants8 and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Part \nA will require 6 person-months of international consulting input (2 experts intermittently) and 50 \nperson-months of domestic consulting input (10 experts intermittently). Part B will require 6 \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004. Guidelines for Procurement under Asian Development Bank Loans. Manila. \n8  ADB. 2005.

The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants for both parts are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  One domestic expert from each consulting firm will be nominated as team leader for \neach of parts A and B and will be responsible for preparing the main report, overall supervision \nof the team, coordination with the international consultants, and monitoring work progress of the \ninternational consultants. There will be several consultation and dissemination workshops.  \n \n20.  The  consultants  will  carry  out  all  the  tasks  in  a  consultative  manner  and  while \nencouraging stakeholder participation.  The consultants are also requested to review ADB\u2019s \nCAREC programs and studies on the Western Region\u2019sd evelopment and to absorb the findings \nand conclusions from these.  \n \n21.  Parts A and B will follow the reporting requirements stated below: \n(i)  An inception report will be submitted within 10 weeks after the fieldwork begins. \n(ii)  A workshop will be organized to review the consultants\u2019  final work program, \nmethodology, and key issues that may impact TA implementation. \n(iii)  An interim report  will be submitted  after the first 8 months of work. This will \nanalyze all parts of the TA and initial recommendations. \n(iv)  A draft final report will be submitted within 15 months after work begins.  \n(v)  The final report, incorporating comments from the Government, ADB, and other \nstakeholders, will be submitted within 1 month after receiving such comments.  \n \n \nIV.

Two teams of international and domestic consultants will be engaged to provide advisory \nand technical services to the Xinjiang and Gansu governments. The outcome of these services \nwill be to promote better and deeper cooperation between the People\u2019s Republic of China P(RC) \nand the Central Asian republics (CARs), as well as more balanced socioeconomic development \nin Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Gansu province. \n \n2.  The consultants  will  carry  out  their  assigned  tasks  in  close  cooperation  with  the \ngovernment agencies and under the vice governors\u2019 guidance. The national and provincial 11th \nfive-year plans for socioeconomic development should be used as the key reference documents \nfor these two studies. \n \n3.  Since the 11th five-year plans have yet to be completed, the terms of reference listed \nbelow may be later revised and supplemented. \n \nA.  Part A \n \n4.
