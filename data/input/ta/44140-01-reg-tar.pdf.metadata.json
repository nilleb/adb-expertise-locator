INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) (2009) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \napproved by the Board of Directors in July 2009 and effective since January 2010, is the result \nof an extensive consultation process with governments, civil society organizations (CSOs), the \nprivate sector, and academia from ADB's member countries. A key policy feature, the SPS \nemphasizes  ADB's  responsibility  to  assist  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  in \nstrengthening their own safeguard systems and in enhancing their implementation capacity to \naddress environmental and social issues. This technical assistance (TA) is designed to support \nthe  strengthening  and  effective  implementation  of  country  safeguard  systems  (CSS).1 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  In  2008,  ADB  adopted  Strategy  2020,2 which  focuses  its  operations  on  promoting \nenvironmentally sustainable and inclusive economic growth. Strategy 2020 embraces a set of \nsix corporate-wide core values, including recognition of country ownership to enable DMCs to \nexercise effective leadership over development policies, strategies, and actions. Further, ADB's \noperational goals include meeting all major commitments under the 2005 Paris Declaration on \nAid Effectiveness3 by the agreement\u2019s target of 2012 through partnerships with its DMCs and \nother development agencies.  \n \n3.  The Accra Agenda for Action in 2008 strongly reiterated the commitments under Paris \nDeclaration  and  called  for  specific  actions  to  strengthen  and  increase  the  use  of  country \nsystems. As pointed out in a 2010 report, since it endorsed the Accra Agenda for Action in 2008, \nADB has made considerable progress in carrying out its responsibilities for (i) strengthening \ncountry ownership; (ii) building more effective, inclusive partnerships; and (iii) delivering and \naccounting for development results, and will seek greater aid and development effectiveness by \npromoting DMC ownership of the development agenda at the country level and by forming more \nproductive, inclusive partnerships to influence aid effectiveness policy at the international level.4 \n \n4.  The SPS arrived at a critical time, as ADB scales up its assistance to DMCs in promoting \nenvironmentally sustainable and inclusive economic growth through Strategy 2020, and as it \ncontinues to focus on improving aid and development effectiveness in Asia and the Pacific. The \nSPS builds upon ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) to enhance their effectiveness and to ensure that the \npolicies remain relevant to DMCs' changing needs. The SPS also better harmonizes the policies \nwith current and emerging international best practices among multilateral development banks \nand private sector financial institutions, such as the Equator Principles.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 3 June 2010.  \n2  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila.  \n3 The major commitments of donors under Paris Declaration are: (i) respect partner country leadership and help \nstrengthen their capacity to exercise it; (ii) base donors overall support on partner countries' national development \nstrategies, institutions, and procedures; (iii) harmonize actions among donors;; (iv) manage resources and improve \ndecision-making for results; (v) and provide partner countries timely, transparent, and comprehensive information \non aid flows. These commitments apply to financial management, procurement, and environmental and social \nsafeguards. \n4  ADB. 2010. Aid Effectiveness Report. Manila.  \n ", "2   \n5.  Among the many important elements of the SPS is its emphasis on assisting DMCs to \nstrengthen and implement their own CSS\u2014an objective that goes well beyond the benefits of \nincreasing the use of CSS to satisfy the environmental and social safeguard requirements of \ndonor-supported projects and programs. Strengthened CSS will enhance DMC ownership and \nbenefit all projects regardless of source of funding, including those undertaken by a DMC \nwithout any international development agencies' support or supervision.  \n \n6.  In the last two decades, DMCs have developed their own systems regarding safeguards \nfor the environment, involuntary resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples to varying degrees. In \nsome DMCs, the legal frameworks have been well established, but implementation remains \nweak due to inadequate institutional capacity, financial shortfalls, and/or lack of meaningful \npublic participation and transparency. In others, legal frameworks are inadequate and require \nsignificant improvement. Experience gained through ongoing ADB TA for strengthening country \nsafeguard systems 5 and that of the World Bank on the use of borrower systems in addressing \nenvironmental and social safeguard issues suggest that (i) the effectiveness of development \nagencies' safeguard policies depends largely on the degree to which the safeguard policy \nprinciples and requirements are rooted in DMCs' culture and socioeconomic context of decision \nmaking, (ii) development agencies can increase the impact of their development assistance if \nthey  support  efforts  to  strengthen  and  work  more  directly  with  DMCs\u2019  existing  legal  and \ngovernance  frameworks  and  institutions,  (iii)  strategies  and  approaches  for  supporting  the \nstrengthening and effective implementation of CSS should be adapted to meet different DMCs \nneeds, (iv) CSS diagnostic studies are a useful tool for helping DMCs identify the areas for CSS \nstrengthening and develop action plans to address the gaps, and (v) development agencies \nneed to work toward greater cooperation in engaging in efforts for the strengthening and use of \nCSS. \n \n7.  In recognition of these suggestions, the SPS commits ADB to expanding its engagement \nwith  DMCs  in  strengthening  their  ownership  and  enhancing  their  capacity  to  address \nenvironmental and social safeguards through a long-term programmatic effort. It also calls for \npursuing  this  effort  with  other  development  agencies  within  the  framework  of  the  Paris \nDeclaration  and  Accra  Agenda  for  Action.  The  proposed  TA  is  designed  to  support  the \nstrengthening and effective implementation of CSS in DMCs. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced environmental and social sustainability of DMC \ndevelopment projects, regardless of their source of funding. The outcome will be strengthened \nCSS through one or more of the following areas in each participating DMC: \n(i)   improved legal and regulatory frameworks for environmental assessment and \nmanagement, involuntary resettlement, and/or Indigenous Peoples; \n(ii)   strengthened  institutions  and  capacity  for  effective  implementation  and \nenforcement  of  and  compliance  with  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to \nenvironmental  assessment  and  management,  involuntary  resettlement  and/or \nIndigenous Peoples safeguards; \n(iii)   enhanced  state-owned  and/or  private  sector  companies'  environmental  and \nsocial management systems; \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.   Output  1: Subproject  implementation. The TA will help ADB provide systematic, \ntimely support for subprojects tailored to the needs of specific DMCs for strengthening and \neffective implementation of their respective CSS. The subprojects will be proposed, prepared \nand administered by ADB departments concerned. In allocating the TA resources, priority will be \ngiven to  \n(i)  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  rules,  and/or  procedures  on  environmental \nassessment  and  management, 6  involuntary  resettlement,  and  Indigenous \nPeoples safeguards; \n(ii)  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development  of  relevant  government \ninstitutions or agencies, CSOs, and/or other stakeholder groups to implement, \nenforce,  and  comply  with  national  laws  and  regulations  on  environmental \nassessment  and  management,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  Indigenous \nPeoples;7 \n(iii)  state-owned  and/or  private  sector  companies'  environmental  and  social \nmanagement systems;8 \n(iv)  public  awareness  and  participation  in  environmental  and  social  assessment, \nplanning, and implementation processes; \n(v)  targeted  training  programs  and/or  studies  on  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards for governments including the judiciary, CSOs, media, academia, \nand/or other stakeholder groups; and \n(vi)  demonstration  activities  (\u201cSouth-South  initiatives\",  such  as  through  twinning \narrangements). \n \n10.  Open to all DMCs, the subprojects will be fully in line with and supportive of DMCs' \npriorities identified in their development plans and programs and with ADB's country partnership \nstrategies. They will be complementary but will not substitute nor duplicate ADB ongoing or \npipeline activities (i.e., the TA will not finance activities that are normally financed by project \npreparatory TA work or by other funds managed by ADB, including the Japan Special Fund). \nThey will also balance the use of international and national consultants, and emphasize the \ntransfer of international experience and knowledge to governments, CSOs, and staff of other \ndomestic organizations in the participating DMC. Each subproject will not exceed $250,000, and \n                                                 \n6  This  may  include  the  environmental  assessment  process,  pollution  prevention  and  abatement,  biodiversity \nconservation and sustainable natural resources management, occupational and community health and safety, and \nphysical cultural resources.  \n7  This may include activities for improved institutional arrangement and administrative procedures, inter-agency \ncoordination and governance, and for effective compliance monitoring and enforcement. \n8  This may include activities for enhanced corporate environmental and social policies, project safeguard review, and \nmonitoring and reporting system. \n ", "4   \nthe participating DMC will commit counterpart funds (in cash and/or in kind). Finally, geographic \nbalance will be taken into account when selecting subprojects. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Knowledge  management  and  dissemination.  Activities  under  this \ncomponent  will  include  CSS  diagnostic  studies,9 conferences,  reports,  publications,  and \nknowledge  exchange  and  dissemination  through  existing  and  well-functioning  regional \nnetwork(s).  \n \n12.  Output 3: Coordination among development agencies. Through the TA, ADB will \ncoordinate with other development agencies in supporting and mobilizing resources toward CSS \ncapacity development activities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $5,000,000 equivalent, financed on a grant basis \nfrom  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).10 Detailed  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  TA subprojects will be proposed, prepared and implemented by operations departments, \nresident missions, Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), or the Office of \nGeneral  Counsel  (OGC)  as  relevant.  Governments,  CSOs,  state-owned  or  private  sector \ncompanies, academia, and other stakeholder groups in participating DMCs can also propose \nactivities through these ADB departments.  \n \n15.  A steering committee, comprising representatives of operations departments, OGC, and \nRSDD will have overall oversight responsibilities of the TA. The committee will review and \napprove subproject proposals, and provide strategic direction for TA implementation. Selection \nof subprojects will be based on the funding priorities (para. 9) and principles and criteria (para. \n10). To be eligible to participate in TA activities, DMCs will be requested to endorse the TA and \nappoint a focal point. No funds will be disbursed until an approval or no-objection letter for the \napproved subproject is secured from the DMC government concerned.  \n \n16.  The Environment and Safeguards Division (RSES) of RSDD will be responsible for \ncoordinating  with  the  ADB  departments  concerned  on  the  identification,  processing,  and \nimplementation of TA activities. The RSES team will be responsible for (i) preparing subproject \nproposal  guidelines  and  formats;  (ii)  coordinating  the  proposal  preparation,  review,  and \nselection process; (iii) screening proposals for eligibility; (iv) establishing and maintaining a \nmonitoring  system  of  approved  TA  activities;  (v)  implementing  knowledge  dissemination \nactivities; (vi) conducting review missions for selected subprojects; and (vii) preparing annual TA \nreports and a final report. The RSES team will work with ADB Department of External Relations \nto manage and disseminate knowledge products, and collaborate with regional network(s) to \nenhance  synergy  and  co-host  workshops.  The  RSES  team  will  work  with  the  Office  of \n                                                 \n9  Where the CSS diagnostic studies are conducted for the purpose of using CSS for ADB-supported projects, \nequivalence and acceptability assessments will be undertaken by ADB in accordance with the procedures specified \nin the SPS.  \n10 The TA will fund subprojects in DMCs including Group A and/or Group B countries with access to Asian \nDevelopment Fund. See ADB's Operations Manual section A1/BP on Classification and Graduation of Developing \nMember Countries (2008) for the list of Groups A and B countries with access to Asian Development Fund. \n ", "  5\nCofinancing  Operations  to  coordinate  with  other  development  agencies  in  supporting  and \nmobilizing resources for CSS capacity development activities. \n \n17.  ADB will recruit consultants to carry out subproject activities and to assist with TA \ncoordination and administration in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). For TA coordination, administration, and CSS diagnostic \nstudies, individual consultants will be recruited including (i) 30 person-months of international \nconsultants as technical advisors for overall TA administration, knowledge product preparation \nand  dissemination,  as  well  as  for  coordination  and  cooperation  with  other  development \nagencies; (ii) 9 person-months of international legal expert(s) for CSS diagnostic studies, and (ii) \n72 person-months of national consultants for TA coordination and administration and CSS \ndiagnostic studies. For subproject implementation, ADB departments concerned will prepare \nterms of reference and cost estimates, and will hire the necessary consultants.  \n \n18.  The equipment and materials to be provided under TA will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Equipment \npurchased for subproject implementation becomes the property of the implementing agency or \nCSO after the subproject completion. Disbursement under the TA will be done in accordance \nwith ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n19.  Subproject  implementation  will  be  monitored  through  inception,  midterm,  and  final \nreviews  by  the  ADB  departments  concerned,  as  required.  These  departments  will  be \nresponsible for ensuring quality and consistency in the proposals, supervising implementation, \nand reporting progress to RSES on a periodic basis. Annual progress reports will also be \nprepared by RSES.  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 3.5 years, from July 2010 to December 2013.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n21.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  a  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $5,000,000 on a grant basis for Strengthening and \nUse of Country Safeguard Systems. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources   \n  Performance Targets and/or  and/or Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nContribute to  Development projects in DMCs  Country reports  Enabling environments \nenhanced  follow international good    for environmentally \nenvironmental and  practices in terms of  Reports of  sustainable and \nsocial sustainability  environmental assessment and  international  inclusive economic \nof development  management, involuntary  development  growth at international \nprojects in  resettlement, and/or Indigenous  agencies  and national levels  \nparticipating DMCs,  Peoples.     \nregardless of source    Media reports  Political will to respond \nof funding  Development projects in DMCs    to country-specific \ncomply with their own laws,  ADB project reviews  issues on environment, \nregulations, and performance  involuntary \nstandards on environmental  resettlement, and \nassessment and management,  Indigenous Peoples at \ninvoluntary resettlement and/or  national and local levels \nIndigenous Peoples. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened CSS  Final TA report and  Ownership and support \nin one or more of  subproject reports  of governments \nthe following areas     \nin each participating  Regional network  Motivation and \nDMC:  database and report  commitment of state-\n    owned or private sector \nImproved country  National, subnational, and/or  Dialogue with  companies \nlegal and regulatory  sector policies, laws,  governments, the   \nframeworks for  regulations, and/or standards  private sector,  Effective cooperation \nenvironmental  that are consistent with  academia, and  with interested and \nassessment and  international good practices  CSOs   qualified CSOs \nmanagement,  adopted in increased number of     \ninvoluntary  DMCs.
