INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia (the Government) has requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the establishment of an effective anti-\nmoney-laundering regime.1 A mission visited Mongolia from 19 to 23 January 2004 to discuss \nwith the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE), Bank of Mongolia (BOM), Ministry of Justice \nand Home Affairs, and Mongolian Securities and Exchange Commission. The mission reached \nan  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objective,  scope,  cost  estimates,  terms  of \nreference, and implementation arrangements for the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Background. Financial sector reforms have been a priority for the Government for more \nthan a decade. During the first half of the 1990s, banking activities were liberalized, bank \nregulations strengthened, and the financial status of nonviable banks improved. More recently, \nthe focus of reforms has shifted to strengthening corporate governance in commercial banks, \ndeveloping an interbank money market, and establishing the legal and regulatory framework for \nnonbank financial institutions. Consequently, the level of financial intermediation has increased, \nand the basic platform for the development of nonbank financial institutions is being put into \nplace.   \n \n3.  Along with financial stabilization and economic growth, are a new series of issues and \nchallenges. Mongolia has experienced a rapidly growing inflow of funds into the country.  This \ninflow  causes  concern.  As  the  source  of  funds  is  not  well  traced  or  tracked,  the  lack  of \ntransparency and information leads to gaps in the financial system through which illegal funds \ncould flow. To ensure financial stability, investor confidence, and orderly growth of the financial \nsystem, Mongolia must establish an effective anti-money-laundering (AML) regime. \n \n4.  Past Government Initiatives. As a first step toward a healthy financial system, the \nNational  Security  Council  adopted  a  resolution  on  12  September  2001  instructing  the \nGovernment and its agencies to cooperate with international organizations to develop the legal \nframework relevant to facilitate anti-money-laundering activities. The resolution was reinforced \nby a presidential decree supporting international anti-terrorist coalitions and the adoption on 10 \nOctober  2001  of  a  full  government  resolution  that  instructed  MOFE  to  cooperate  with \ninternational  organizations  to  combat  terrorist  financing  and  money  laundering  activities. \nFurthermore, the Government has signed the International Convention for the Suppression of \nthe  Financing  of  Terrorism  and  instructed  relevant  ministries  to  exchange  information  on \nactivities that might be linked to drug trafficking or money laundering. \n \n5.  Subsequently,  a  draft  AML  legislation  was  prepared  with  assistance  from  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund.    It  is  expected  to  be  passed  during  the  Parliament  session \nbeginning in September 2004. The legislation was drafted following recommendations of the \nFinancial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and reflects substantial compliance with \ninternational standards from the perspective of an effective legal framework. The United States \nDepartment of Treasury is also proposing a financial crimes advisory assistance project to \nprovide the Government with information on AML regulations and investigative procedures and \ntechniques, as well as short-term training in these areas.   \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 5 March 2004. \n ", "2  \n6.  Once the AML legislation is passed, appropriate institutional arrangement will have to be \nestablished and institutional capacity built to effectively implement the law. Establishing an AML \nregime in Mongolia will require the preparation of implementing rules and regulations for AML \nlegislation, establishment of a monitoring system for suspicious activities, and capacity building \nof key institutions responsible for the operation of the AML regime. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The goal of the TA is to promote the stability and soundness of the financial system in \nMongolia by assisting in the creation of an effective AML regime. In turn, the AML regime will \nalso reduce the country's vulnerability to criminal activities and help Mongolia comply with \ninternational standards for AML. The TA has been designed taking into account the activities of \nthe International Monetary Fund and United States Department of Treasury, to avoid duplication \nof effort and to ensure effectiveness and complementarity. The outcome of the TA will be part of \na reform program to be supported under the proposed nonbanking financial sector program loan \nscheduled for 2005. \n8.  With the AML legislation in place, the TA aims to (i) draft the implementing rules and \nregulations of the law, (ii) establish an effective suspicious transaction monitoring system, and \n(iii) transfer knowledge and build capacity for key institutions to establish an effective AML \nregime. \n9.  The major outputs expected from the TA are \n(i)  a time-bound plan with milestones for implementing an effective AML regime \nthat will also provide a common reference for what needs to be done and \nwhen, \n(ii)  a blueprint detailing the design and requirements for a system to monitor \nsuspicious transactions, \n(iii)  establishment  of  a  financial  intelligence  unit  and  provision  of  a \ncomprehensive draft for key responsibilities of this entity, \n(iv)  specialized training programs for staff of key institutions responsible for the \nimplementation of an effective AML regime; and  \n(v)  development  and  implementation  of  a  strategy  for  strengthening  and \nmaintaining support for the implementation of an effective AML regime. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will conduct activities to facilitate the implementation of an effective anti-money-\nlaundering regime in Mongolia. In particular, it will include \n(i)  assessment of the adequacy of recently drafted AML legislation against the \nbest  international  practices,  and  recommended  amendments  to  the \nlegislation, if necessary;  \n   ", "  3\n(ii)  draft implementation rules and regulations for the AML law;  \n(iii)  assessment and a detailed blueprint for information technology and reporting \nrequirements for an effective monitoring system to track suspicious financial \ntransactions. To enable the Government to acquire and establish such a \nsystem, as early as possible, the blueprint and requirements for the system \nwill be developed by a small team of international and domestic consultants \nahead of the rest of the TA; \n(iv)  a time-bound action plan with milestones for implementing the AML regime in \nclose  consultation  with  implementing  government  agencies  and  other \nrelevant regional and international groups; and  \n(v)  training seminars for key institutions responsible for the implementation of the \nAML regime: training will be conducted by consultants engaged under the TA, \nbut additional resource persons may also be brought in, as necessary, to \nconduct targeted workshops on special areas, and the training programs will \nbe designed and implemented in close consultation with existing training \ninstitutions. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $590,000  equivalent,  comprising  $430,000  in  foreign \nexchange  costs  and  $160,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $430,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$70,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis, with a \nportion amounting to $286,000 equivalent being financed by the Government of Spain, and \n$214,000 equivalent by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will provide the remaining \nlocal costs equivalent to $90,000 to cover in-kind costs and services. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  BOM will be the Executing Agency for the TA. An interagency coordination committee \nchaired  by  BOM\u2019s  executive  director  and  including  representatives  from  each  of  the \nimplementing agencies will be established. The implementing agencies will include MOFE, \nMongolian Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs. The \ncoordination committee will play a central role in facilitating smooth implementation of the TA.  \n13.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 6 months and is expected to commence in \nSeptember 2004 and be completed by March 2005. The TA will require an estimated total of 18 \nperson-months of consulting services, consisting of 9 person-months of international, and 9 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services. The international consultants will include an \nAML expert and team leader (4 person-months), a financial sector expert (1 person-month), a \nforensic  accounting  and  financial  Intelligence  unit  expert  (2.5  person-months),  and  an \ninformation  technology  and  communication  expert  (1.5  person-months).  The  domestic \nconsultants will be engaged for the same length of time as the corresponding international \nconsultants. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the engagement of \nconsultants. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n   ", "4  \n14.  The team leader will coordinate the inputs of all other consultants. The consultants will \nsubmit (i) an inception report within 3 weeks after start of services, (ii) interim progress reports \nat appropriate stages of TA implementation, (iii) a draft final report before TA completions, and \n(iv) the final TA report 2 weeks after receiving comments from the BOM and ADB. Seminars and \nworkshops will be organized intermittently to invite comments from international and domestic \nexperts in the field, and to disseminate the TA findings. Computers and other equipment to \nsupport the implementation of the TA will be procured by direct purchase in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nIV.       THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $286,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Spain, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $214,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Mongolia for \nEstablishing an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Regime, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   ", "    Appendix 1  5\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \nDesign
