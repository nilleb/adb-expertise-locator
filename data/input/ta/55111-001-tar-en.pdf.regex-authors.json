INTRODUCTION\n1. This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) responds to the  requests of\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to strengthen public\nsector capacity for the development of sustainable infrastructure, including through state-owned\nenterprises (SOEs), in fiscally responsive ways.1 The TA will support strengthening infrastructure\ngovernance, including alignment with the quality infrastructure investment (QII) principles,2 by\nfocusing on the policy, institutional, and fiscal frameworks in specific infrastructure projects in\nADB\u2019s country programs and portfolio.3 As part of this focus, the TA will identify means to reduce\nliabilities resulting from weak SOE performance.\n2. The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational plan for operational priority (OP) 6\non strengthening governance and institutional capacity, and contributes to OP 2 on accelerating\nprogress in gender equality and OP 4 on making cities more livable (footnote 1). It is also aligned\nwith the strategic priority areas in the Asian Development Fund 13 replenishment on quality\ninfrastructure and debt management.4 The TA is included in the 2021 ADB Management-\napproved  results-based  work  plan  of  the  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change\nDepartment.5\nII. ISSUES\n3. Asia and the Pacific continues to confront a significant public infrastructure deficit\u2014400\nmillion Asians live without electricity, 300 million without safe drinking water, and 1.5 billion without\nbasic sanitation.6 ADB forecasts the annual infrastructure investment gap for 25 DMCs (i.e., the\nprojected need to maintain growth momentum, tackle poverty, and respond to climate change\nless the current level of investment) during 2016\u20132020 at $459 billion, or 2.4% of gross domestic\nproduct.7 Access  to  sustainable  infrastructure  has  become  even  more  critical  to  stimulate\neconomic growth as the region emerges from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.\nFinancing this investment will require ADB\u2019s DMCs to increase domestic resource mobilization\nefforts while taking on substantial debt at a time when many developing economies have seen\nthe fastest and most broad-based increase in debt in the past 50 years, further accentuated by\nthe collapse in economic activity and revenues because of COVID-19.8\n4. While increased infrastructure spending (for both social and economic infrastructure) will\nhelp stimulate economic recovery in some countries, other countries may not be able to provide\nenough fiscal support because of their debt and revenue positions, leading to higher borrowing\n1  ADB. 2018.

G20 Principles of Quality Infrastructure Investment. Communiqu\u00e9 \nannex for the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting.

", "2\ncosts and reduced infrastructure investments, or prioritizing spending on more immediate needs. \nAgainst this backdrop, it is important that infrastructure spending is undertaken efficiently and in \nline with the six principles of QII (footnote 3).9 The value addition is to help ADB\u2019s DMCs \nstrengthen effective public investment management (PIM) with a focus on fiscal risk and debt \nmanagement to promote a sustainable infrastructure project pipeline. The combination of (i) \nstrengthened policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks and (ii) management of the \ndecision-making  process  in  traditional  public  sector  investments,  SOEs,  and  public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs) will be critical to maximize the impact of infrastructure development and \nsupport fiscal governance, especially for countries that have elevated debt and low growth.10 \n5. First, DMCs with stronger fiscal management institutions have more predictable, credible,\nefficient,  productive,  and  sustainable  investments  that  deliver  social,  environmental,  and\neconomic objectives. Better infrastructure governance improves both the volume and quality of\ninfrastructure investment decisions and overall implementation across the life cycle of an asset.\nImproved PIM and better integration of capital and recurrent expenditures are more likely to\nensure that projects are built on time and on budget, thereby containing risks of ensuing debt\nbuildup.  The  key  drivers  of  infrastructure  governance  are  investment  efficiency,  financial\nsustainability, and transparency in all decision-making processes. The International Monetary\nFund (IMF) found that countries in Asia and the Pacific, on average, lose 32% of potential benefits\nof public investment in infrastructure because of inefficiencies in the investment process, and\npoorer economies face an even greater efficiency gap of up to 40%.11 This results in projects that\nare neither properly costed upstream to take into account risks, including climate risks, nor\nintegrated  with  the  medium-term  framework  to  inform  public  investment  decisions.12 Many\njurisdictions lack transparent fiscal data on infrastructure investment because of weak policy and\nregulatory frameworks and/or limited experience in assessing subsidies and contingent liabilities.\n6. Second, weak governance and underperforming institutions are a constraint to delivery of\nbasic  services  and  infrastructure  development,  and  reduce  the  potential  for  private  sector\ninvestment.  SOEs  play  a  major  role  in infrastructure  investment  and  in  the  operation  and\nmaintenance (O&M) of infrastructure assets.13 Poor SOE governance, including ineffective SOE\noversight, underfunded and opaque policy mandates for SOEs, and weak governance at the\nenterprise level, can directly impact public finances through SOE losses and lower profitability.\nThese, in turn, lead to large transfers from the budget and the creation of high SOE indebtedness\nand other contingent liabilities. Poor SOE governance can also directly and indirectly raise costs\nof infrastructure and lower its quality, especially over the longer term, and may undermine\nopportunities to bring in other sources of finance. SOE reform can reduce these liabilities,\nprofessionalize state asset management and oversight, introduce two-sided balance sheets for\ngovernments that show assets as well as liabilities, improve SOE governance and financial\ndiscipline, and allow for nonsovereign borrowing by SOEs and other forms of private sector\n9  ADB.

Well Spent: How Strong Infrastructure Governance Can End Waste in Public \nInvestment. Washington, DC: IMF. To measure country infrastructure governance capability, the IMF developed a \npublic investment management assessment to evaluate infrastructure governance  based on  an  analysis of \ninstitutions that cover the three stages of the public investment cycle: planning, allocation, and implementation. It \nassesses institutions from three perspectives: institutional design and roles, effectiveness, and reform priorities. ADB \nhas collaborated with the IMF on PIM assessments in Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. \n12 ADB. 2021. A System-Wide Approach for Infrastructure Resilience: Technical Note.

As a share of total infrastructure investment, SOEs contributed 74% in East Asia and the Pacific \nand 44% in South Asia in 2017. ", "3 \nparticipation.  All  these  create  new  ways  to  finance  infrastructure  investment,  improve  its \nmanagement, and create sovereign fiscal space.14 \n7. Third, the public sector is turning to the private sector to explore PPPs as a means of\ndeveloping and managing critical infrastructure. Prudent approaches to PPPs should be adapted,\nespecially in developing countries without well-developed national infrastructure governance\ninstitutions. PPPs are not a panacea, and do not automatically lift fiscal constraints. Although user\nfees may contribute to fiscal sustainability, international experience has often resulted in a fiscal\nillusion from the fact that PPPs are recorded off-budget and are not accounted for properly on top\nof public debt as a combination of contingent liabilities, fiscal commitments for future (availability)\n \npayments, and foregone direct revenue generation to the government (footnote 7).Countries also\nneed to ensure that investment decisions for all investment projects\u2014not just PPPs\u2014are first\nbased on internally vetted cost\u2013benefit analysis and the result of a prioritization process within\ntheir multiyear investment planning aligned with sector strategies. Once the project analysis\ndemonstrates value for money (VfM), only then should a decision be made on which option offers\nthe best VfM\u2014a PPP or a traditional infrastructure procurement.15\n8. Improving infrastructure governance requires a robust institutional response and a shift\nfrom a conceptual understanding of QII to DMCs actually applying QII to their portfolio of public\nand private investment projects.16 Based on the findings in the 2020 Development Effectiveness\nReview, the share of operations supporting governance and/or capacity development fell from\n74%  of  projects  signed  during  2016\u20132018  to  68%  during  2019\u20132020. 17 This  finding  is\nunderscored by the sector-wide evaluation on ADB\u2019s energy policy and program during 2009\u2013\n2019, which showed that ADB programs had limited effectiveness in capacity building and\ngovernance.18 The sector-wide evaluation of ADB support for the transport sector during 2010\u2013\n2018 also found that the sustainability of transportation services and assets was undermined by\nweak institutions and governance marked by poor planning, budgeting, and revenue generation.19\nFurther, a synthesis report of evaluations of projects in the water and other urban infrastructure\nand services sector highlights related weaknesses in the sustainability of infrastructure assets.\nThe main issues affecting sustainability of urban water projects are difficulty in making realistic\ncost estimates for O&M, reluctance to charge appropriate tariffs, and lack of efficiency in O&M\nexpenditure.20 The evaluation of ADB\u2019s support to PPPs found a lack of early-stage screening of\nPPP projects using VfM and cost\u2013benefit analysis to ensure the allocation of funding to projects\nwith the highest value for the economy.21\n14 D.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: efficiency in public infrastructure investment\nin selected ADB DMCs enhanced.25 The TA will have the following outcome: governance and\ninstitutional capacity in life cycle management of infrastructure investments, including through\nSOEs, in selected ADB DMCs improved.26\nB. Outputs, Methods, and Activities\n11. Output 1: Legal, policy, and regulatory frameworks for infrastructure and state-\nowned enterprise governance improved. To enhance infrastructure sustainability in selected\nADB DMCs, the TA will support the development of legal, policy, and regulatory frameworks\nacross the PIM life cycle. This output will include the (i) development of upstream and midstream\nguidance and methodologies to increase the capacity to plan and efficiently allocate resources\nand strengthen PIM institutions;27 (ii) development of mechanisms for coordinating infrastructure\nplanning  and  financing  across  multiple  levels  of  government,  including  support  to  define\ninstitutional responsibilities and policies for funding from the central government, and ensure\nsustainable levels of subnational borrowing;28 and (iii) establishment of SOE governance and\nprofessionalization of SOE oversight at the local, provincial, and national levels to facilitate\nmunicipal and nonsovereign sources of finance, and to develop and improve two-sided balance\nsheets  for  state  assets  that  can  account  for  infrastructure  investment,  depreciation,  and\nmaintenance.\n22 These  include  two  TA  projects:  ADB.
