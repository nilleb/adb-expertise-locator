The Government of Mongolia requested support from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to strengthen its social health insurance system. A fact-finding mission took place in \nUlaanbaatar in January 2013, and ADB reached agreement with the government on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, costs and financing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of \nreference for consulting services for the technical assistance (TA). Concept clearance was \nobtained on 14 February 2013. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since its establishment in 1994, the social health insurance system in Mongolia has \ndemonstrated good achievements, including high coverage of over 90.0% of the population.2 \nHealth care delivery has also been sustained despite severe budget constraints in the early \n1990s at the onset of the socioeconomic transition in Mongolia. However, those insured are \nincreasingly dissatisfied with social health insurance because of poor service quality provided by \nhospitals and increasing out-of-pocket expenditures. \n \n3.  High out-of-pocket expenses have resulted from social health insurance reimbursement \nceilings, exclusion of costly procedures and diagnostic services from reimbursement, limited \nreimbursement  for  medicines,  enforcement  of  various  forms  of  co-payments,3 existence  of \ninformal payments, and the need to seek better quality care abroad. As a result, out-of-pocket \npayments  for  health  services  stood  at  41.0%  of  total  health  expenditures  in  2010,4 while \nutilization  of  hospital  services  was  lowest  among  the  poor,  raising  concerns  about  the \ninclusiveness of growth. In 2009, 3.8% of total households (or 27,442 households) experienced \ncatastrophic health expenditures,5 and 1.8% of total households became impoverished due to \nhealth payments.6 \n \n4.  The government subsidizes social health insurance for 58.0% of the population, but \ntargeting is ineffective and does not take into account the ability to pay.7 Ineffective targeting \nresults in 10.0% of the population remaining uninsured (mostly poor unemployed and herders). \nAlthough, the government subsidizes 58.0% of the population this accounts for only 9.0% of \nsocial health insurance revenues, as subsidies are set too low (currently about $5 per year per \ninsured person) and are not indexed to the rising cost of care. Employees and employers in the \nformal  sector,  representing  28.0%  of  the  insured  population,  generate  86.0%  of  health \ninsurance revenues. The disparity between the proportion of formal sector workers who are \ninsured (28.0%) and the contribution to social health insurance revenues (86.0%) has frustrated \nemployers and made social health insurance unattractive to them. The remaining 5.0% of social \nhealth insurance revenues are contributions paid by self-employed and informal workers. \n \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 February 2013. \n2  Social health insurance coverage peaked at 98.0% in 2011 due to blanket universal coverage paid for the \nuninsured by the Human Development Fund, which was discontinued in 2012. \n3  Co-payment between the patient and the hospital are applied for certain services. \n4  World Health Organization. WHO Global Health Expenditures. http://www.who.int/nha/expenditure_database/en/ \n5  The World Health Organization defines catastrophic expenditures (illnesses) as expenditures that lead to nonfood \nhousehold expenditures of more than 40.0%. \n6  World Health Organization. Forthcoming.  Financial Burden of Health Payments (6 Country Study). Manila. \n7  Government subsidies target certain categories of the population such as the elderly, children under 18, the \ndisabled, students, and soldiers as provided in the Citizens\u2019 Health Insurance Law. Subsidies are meant to target \nthe needy but this obviously leads to considerable mistargeting.  \n ", "2  \n5.  The present social health insurance system governance structure has led to tensions \nwithin  government  organizations  (mainly  the  ministries  of  finance,  health,  and  population \ndevelopment and social protection) and between the Health Insurance Organization and the \nHealth Insurance Sub-Council.8 There are no clear lines of accountability for social health \ninsurance performance. Moreover, the current legal framework further fragments responsibilities \nby making the Ministry of Health instead of the Health Insurance Organization responsible for \nfunctions such as designing the benefit package, setting payment tariffs, and selecting service \nproviders. There is also potential for serious conflicts of interest where the main service provider \n(i.e., the Ministry of Health) also sets payment tariffs and selects providers to be reimbursed by \nsocial health insurance. The social health insurance system also lacks mechanisms and an \neffective information system through which insured people can report complaints and provide \nfeedback on social health insurance deficiencies; these are essential for informed decision \nmaking and accountability. \n \n6.  The Health Insurance Organization has limited capacity, particularly in terms of service \ncosting, actuarial projections, contract negotiations, and monitoring of quality of services. It is \nmerely one of the departments of the Social Insurance General Office and is subject to legal \nrestrictions when it comes to staff and operational resource allotment. These circumstances \nhave prevented the Health Insurance Organization from developing into a strong purchaser of \nhealth services on behalf of the insured population. Furthermore, for the Health Insurance \nOrganization to act as a purchaser of care on behalf of the insured requires an effective health \ninformation system to monitor quality of services and financial autonomy of public hospitals to \nenter into negotiations with the Health Insurance Organization. In addition, all public hospitals \nare  allocated  social  health  insurance  funds  systematically  regardless  of  performance, \npreventing the Health Insurance Organization from effectively selecting hospitals to contract \nwith.  \n \n7.  To address the deficiencies in paras. 2\u20136 above, Parliament is revising the Citizens\u2019 \nHealth Insurance Law. The revision of the law is undergoing a broad consultation process, \nincluding with civil society organizations. It is envisaged that the revised law will introduce broad \nreforms to improve governance and financial sustainability; improve targeting of government \nsubsidies,  including  for  the  poor;  increase  access  to  an  essential  benefit  package;  and \nstrengthen the autonomy and operational capacity of the Health Insurance Organization. The \nrevised  Citizens\u2019  Health  Insurance  Law  will  give  more  weight  to  reforms  that  the  Health \nInsurance Organization and the Health Insurance Sub-Council have started to implement with \nTA provided by German development cooperation through GIZ and ADB.9  \n                                                \n8  The national insurance system is governed by the National Insurance Council, which has several sub-councils, \nincluding the Health Insurance Sub-Council. This Sub-Council acts as a multisectoral oversight body for the Health \nInsurance Organization, which at present is a department of the Social Insurance General Office. This office is an \nimplementing agency of the Ministry of Population Development and Social Protection. The Health Insurance \nOrganization, which included 65 staff nationwide at the end of 2011, is in charge of the day-to-day management of \nthe social health insurance system, primarily reviewing claims from health providers, contracting with health \nproviders, monitoring providers\u2019 performances, and managing social health insurance data. The Health Insurance \nSub-Council  includes  representatives  from  the  government,  the  Mongolian  Employers\u2019  Federation,  and  the \nConfederation of Trade Union.  \n9  ADB.  2003.

The support has \nresulted in (i) refining important aspects of the social health insurance system, including its governance; (ii) \ninitiating the determination of cost estimates for health services; (iii) strengthening the provider payment; (iv) \ncabinet approval of the health financing strategy 2010\u20132014; (v) developing a health financing model, including \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  increased  financial  accessibility  of  health  services, \nespecially  for  the  poor.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  performance  of  the  social  health \ninsurance system. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  To  improve  the  performance  of  the  social  health  insurance  system,  the  TA  will \nstrengthen the institutional and human resources capacity of the Health Insurance Organization \nand the Health Insurance Sub-Council.10 It will assist in (i) developing financial tools for social \nhealth insurance; (ii) improving internal management of the Health Insurance Organization, \nincluding contractual tools and monitoring of quality of health services; and (iii) improving the \ngovernance structure of the social health insurance system.   \n \n10.  Key activities of the TA will be organized under three outputs:  \n \n(i)  Output 1: Increased capacity for social health insurance financing. This \noutput  will  help  the  social  health  insurance  system  increase  its  capacity  to \ndetermine costs of services, strengthen provider payment systems, and promote \nstandardized care in hospitals for cost control and increased quality of services. It \nwill also facilitate monitoring sustainability of the social health insurance fund and \nimprove the efficiency of government subsidies to the social health insurance \nsystem, including enrolling the poor, identified through proxy means testing, in \nthe social health insurance system.11 \n(ii)  Output  2:  Improved  performance  through  management  systems  and \ncapacity development of the Health Insurance Organization. This output will \nstrengthen the management and organizational capacity of the social Health \nInsurance  Organization,  including  its  purchasing  capacity  through  selective \ncontracting and monitoring of the quality of health services. It will also update the \nmedium-term  strategy  of  the  Health  Insurance  Organization  and  assist  in \ninstitutionalizing the preparation of its business plan. The output will conduct \ntraining  for  staff  of  the  Health  Insurance  Organization  based  on  a  thorough \nassessment  of  internal  management  procedures,  including  human  resources \nmanagement and information technology requirements. \n                                                                                                                                                       \nsingle purchaser and pooling of funding from the state budget and the social health insurance fund; and (vi) \nintroducing key inputs in drafting of the revised Citizens\u2019 Health Insurance Law. \n10 With the passage of the revised Citizens\u2019 Health Insurance Law, the Health Insurance Sub-Council could be \nelevated to a Health Insurance Council. \n11  The legal framework for enrolling the poor identified through proxy means testing is embedded in the amended \nSocial Welfare Law of 2012, whose passage was assisted by the ADB-supported Social Sectors Support Program \n(ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grant \nand Technical Assistance Grant to Mongolia for the Social Sectors Support Program. Manila). The ADB-funded \nFood and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and Project (ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors: Proposed Grants to Mongolia for the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and \nProject. Manila) has supported implementation of a national proxy means test to identify poor households. The \nproxy means test was adopted by the National Statistical Office and the former Ministry of Social Welfare and \nLabour in 2010. The resulting database is being used to target social welfare programs such as the food stamp and \nmedicard programs (supported by ADB) and will be used to enroll the poor in social health insurance. It is expected \nthat the database will eventually support targeting of other programs, such as education or energy subsidies or \naccess to employment and skills building programs. \n ", "4  \n(iii)  Output 3: Strengthened governance of the social health insurance system. \nThis output will strengthen the governance of the social health insurance system \nthrough capacity development of members of the Health Insurance Council on \nsocial consensus and policy on social health insurance. It will also help further \ndevelop and institutionalize a number of tools, such as satisfaction surveys and \nregular publications on the performance of providers and the Health Insurance \nOrganization as well as on insured members\u2019 rights and obligations. Output 3 will \ndesign and assist in the implementation of a complaints and redress mechanism. \nThe output will also organize and increase the capacity of the social health \ninsurance  system  in  media  relations  activities  to  market  and  increase  the \nunderstanding of social health insurance. The work on hospital autonomy under \nthe  Ministry  of  Health  to  address  the  limited  financial  autonomy  of  public \nhospitals will be supported to ensure contracts can be negotiated and hospitals \ncan be more accountable for the results of the contracts. The TA will recommend \na step-by-step integration of state and social health insurance funding to turn the \nHealth Insurance Organization into a single purchaser. A knowledge product will \nbe prepared to capture the knowledge gained on policy practices, international \nexperience, operational aspects, and recommendations to further develop the \nsocial health insurance system in Mongolia. \n \n11.  Potential risks are (i) the delayed passage of the revised Citizens\u2019 Health Insurance Law \nand (ii) the passage of a revised law that does not include all the expected reform elements. \nBoth risks are considered manageable as the draft revised law is included for discussion in \nParliament, and because there is wide consensus on major reform elements in Parliament. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,700,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, remuneration and per diem of \ncounterpart staff, administrative support, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  At present, the Health Insurance Organization is part of the Social Insurance General \nOffice,  an  implementing  agency  under  the  Ministry  of  Population  Development  and  Social \nProtection  in  charge  of  implementing  social  security  programs.  The  Ministry  of  Population \nDevelopment and Social Protection will be the executing agency for the TA and the Social \nInsurance General Office will be the implementing agency.12 \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months from 30 November 2013 to 31 October \n2016. ADB will recruit a consulting firm using quality-based selection to provide 29 person-\nmonths of international and 56 person-months of national consultants, including experts in \nsocial health insurance policy and management, governance, and capacity building.13 The firm \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \n                                                \n12 Depending on the outcome of the revised Citizens\u2019 Health Insurance Law, the selection of the executing agency \ncould be revised. If the Health Insurance Organization becomes a regulatory agency independent of line ministries, \nthe prime minister\u2019s office or deputy prime minister\u2019s office could be the executing agency. \n13 Quality-based selection is used as (i) the social health insurance reform is highly specialized, and (ii) the quality of \nthe services is of overriding importance for the outcome of the project. \n \n ", "  5\namended from time to time). A national health insurance specialist (36 person-months) and a \nnational administrative and finance coordinator (36 person-months) will be recruited individually \nto facilitate day-to-day organizational and technical matters, liaise with the executing agency \nand other stakeholders, and monitor the outputs of the consulting firm. The national health \ninsurance specialist will be responsible for procuring the TA equipment under the supervision of \nthe executing agency in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The executing agency will retain the equipment upon TA completion. The \noutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). To facilitate implementation, \nADB may establish an advance payment facility for the executing agency to support certain \nagreed  cash  expenditures,  including  workshops,  training,  seminars  and  conferences,  and \nimplementation  of  field  work  and  survey  activities,  with  details  of  the  proposed  activities, \nincluding cost estimates, submitted through the executing agency to ADB for approval. ADB \nmay also make certain direct payments (e.g., for workshop venues). \n \n16.  Regular  seminars  will  be  held  with  representatives  of  government,  social  health \ninsurance  institutions,  media,  and  civil  society  to  discuss  TA  achievements  and  issues.  \nDissemination of TA achievements will be ensured through workshops, policy debates, printed \npublications, the local press, and during training activities with policy makers, the private sector, \ncivil society, and the media. Information campaigns will be organized during TA implementation \nto disseminate information and market social health insurance. A final conference will be held \nwith broad participation from the public and private sectors and civil society to present and \ndiscuss the knowledge product and the manual prepared for the social partners (the Mongolian \nEmployers\u2019 Federation, and the Confederation of Trade Union) involved in overseeing the social \nhealth insurance system. \n \nIV.
