INTRODUCTION \n1.  Health is a public good, which impacts beyond the individual, household, or national \nlevel. Strategy 2020 highlights that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) should mitigate the \nadverse health impacts of all of its infrastructure and trade facilitation projects, and should use \nits comparative advantage in supporting regional public goods and the cross-border nature of \nhealth.1 This is especially so given the increasing mobility within and integration of Central Asia, \nand the increased risk and consequence of cross-border health issues, new and reemerging \ncommunicable diseases and HIV/AIDS being good examples. \n \n2.  ADB is prepared to provide leadership and assistance for regional public goods, i.e., \ncommunicable disease control and prevention, and strengthening regional health security in \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) countries. The severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome crisis and avian influenza events provide extensive evidence that developing member \ncountries  (DMCs)  look  to  ADB  to  provide  leadership  in  regional  approaches;  advise  on \npreparedness  and  capacity  building;  and,  where  necessary,  respond  to  emergencies  and \nlonger-term preparedness.2 \n \n3.  The CAREC 2020 strategic framework emphasizes infrastructure development and trade \nfacilitation. It also promotes building capacity on regional public goods, such as communicable \ndisease control and disaster risk management, and provides for capacity building, research, and \nknowledge products as it aims to strengthen its knowledge pillar.3 \n \n4.  Partnerships will play an increasingly important role in promoting public goods. This \nproposed technical assistance (TA)4 provides an excellent opportunity for ADB to complement \nthe acknowledged technical leadership role of agencies such as the World Health Organization \n(WHO)  and  facilitate  cross-sector  collaboration,  and  therefore  enhance  the  development \nimpacts of strengthened regional health security.5 \n \n5.  The TA will strengthen the capacity of DMCs in Central and West Asia to prevent and \nrespond to communicable diseases and enhance implementation of the International Health \nRegulations (IHR).   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n6.    The CAREC program and ADB investments have played important roles in facilitating \nconnectivity  and  economic  links  within  Central  Asia  and  between  Central  Asia  and  other \nregions, contributing to increased trade and competitiveness and to economic growth. However, \nincreased connectivity has been accompanied by increased risks to health security. The region \nhas become a hot spot for communicable diseases, including transboundary animal diseases, \nHIV/AIDS,6 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,7 and vaccine-preventable diseases.8  \n                                            \n1   ADB. 2008.

Manila.  \n4   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 March 2013. \n5    ADB is well placed, through the CAREC Secretariat, to facilitate regional cooperation and coordination on health \nissues. Communicable disease prevention and control is a second-tier area under CAREC 2020. \n6   Increasing availability of illicit drugs has led to an increase in unsafe practices associated with injecting drug use \nand unprotected sex work, which are seen as the key drivers of an expanding HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region. \n \n ", "2     \n \n7.    Disease  outbreaks  also  undermine  economic  growth  through  impacts  on  affected \nindustries,  such  as  livestock.  Disease  outbreaks  and  poor  control  and  prevention systems \ndirectly undermine regional connectivity, e.g., if borders are closed or trade is slowed during \noutbreaks. In this context, supporting control and prevention of communicable diseases, and \nparticularly regional aspects, is crucial to support investments made under CAREC and to \nenhance regional connectivity. With increased trade, and with CAREC countries entering into \nWorld Trade Organization agreements, this support becomes economically vital.9 \n \n8.    The support provided by this TA will complement the project-level mitigation measures \ncarried out under ADB projects, as many of the issues related to communicable diseases are \nmost effectively addressed at a national or regional level. ADB has a long history of integrating \nHIV/AIDS  mitigation  measures  in  infrastructure  projects.  However,  mitigation  measures  in \nCentral  Asia  have  been  scattered  and  not  integrated  in  robust  strengthening  of  national \nHIV/AIDS mitigation plans, which could have supported the weak national health systems.  \n \n9.    This is also evident in the weak implementation of the IHR (IHR 2005, updated 2007).10 \nAnother urgent need is improving the capacity for implementation of health measures at border-\ncrossing points to reach IHR standards.11 This capacity development must be coordinated \nbetween bordering countries, and between different ministries involved in cross-border health \nmeasures. WHO held consultations with Central Asian countries in April 2011 and reported \nhigh-level interest in improving regional health security to meet its target of fully implementing \nthe IHR by 2014. Strengthening regional core capacities for surveillance is a key objective of the \nIHR. However, weak surveillance systems and limited availability of good-quality data continue \nto hamper the ability rapidly and effectively respond to emerging health threats. Improved \nregional capacity to implement regional surveillance is urgently needed.  \n \n10.   Knowledge sharing and capacity building in the region have been limited by the absence \nof a regional platform and the lack of Russian language materials and guidelines. The CAREC \nprogram and the CAREC Institute both have dedicated websites. By building on this existing \ncapacity  to  disseminate  information  and  materials,  this  TA  aims  to  build  a  sustainable \nmechanism for knowledge sharing and capacity building on communicable disease prevention \nand control.  \n \n11.   Upon successful implementation, the approach identified may be rolled out to other \ncountries and integrated fully into CAREC as a second-tier activity.  \n                                            \nThe region belongs to one of the few globally where HIV/AIDS infection is still increasing and where the epidemic \nis actually rapidly increasing, especially among key population groups at risk. \n7   Weakened public health and disease surveillance systems have led to a 118% increase in tuberculosis, together \nwith the highest prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis worldwide. United Nations Economic and Social \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific. 2011. Statistical Yearbook for Asia and the Pacific 2011. Bangkok. \n8   Although vaccination coverage of childhood communicable diseases is reported to be 92%\u201398% in Central Asia, \nthe actual vaccination coverage is estimated to be much lower, leading to outbreaks such as polio in Tajikistan in \n2010 (data source: WHO\u2013United Nations Children's Fund, Official coverage estimates, 2010). WHO is currently \nsupporting the region to keep its polio-free status, and the region is aiming for measles- and rubella-free status. \n9   The People's Republic of China, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Tajikistan are the only CAREC \ncountries that are currently World Trade Organization members. \n10  The IHR constitute an international legal instrument that is binding for all WHO member states, including Central \nAsian countries. All countries except for one Central Asian state have requested an extension of 2 years of the \ndeadline for IHR implementation until June 2014. During fact finding, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan \nwelcomed this TA initiative, and consultations led by WHO confirmed that Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and \nUzbekistan are also interested in this TA, which will provide support in implementing the IHR. \n11  As defined in Part B of Annex 1 of the IHR. \n ", "3 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA is decreased incidence of communicable diseases in participating \nCentral Asian countries, in particular of HIV/AIDS in key population groups at risk and of \nvaccine-preventable  diseases.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  is  strengthened  core  capacity  for \nsurveillance and response to communicable diseases in pilot countries in line with the IHR.12 \nStrengthening the IHR was identified as the best way to strengthen national and regional health \nsystems in order to improve HIV/AIDS and communicable disease surveillance and control. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Output  1:  Mapping  of  communicable  disease  vulnerability  and  response \nconducted  in  each  participating  country.  Effective  control  of  communicable  diseases \nrequires information and evidence on the vulnerability of its population and geographic hot spots \nof  disease  incidence  and  prevalence. WHO  supports  member  states  in  mapping  potential \nhazards and vulnerabilities, which allows for development of focused preparedness activities to \nreduce the impact of crises, and thus prevent them from developing into full-scale disasters. \nOne of the activities in this field has been the development of a disaster vulnerability mapping e-\natlas to encourage ministries of health and other stakeholders within the health community to \ndevelop and improve their disaster management capacities.13 This e-atlas will be used as a \nframework  for  HIV/AIDS  and  communicable  disease  vulnerability  mapping  in  each  target \ncountry, including mapping of vaccination coverage for measles, rubella, and polio. This will \nallow the provision of sex-disaggregated and analyzed data for decision making for Central \nAsian governments and facilitate regional dialogue about cross-border risks from communicable \ndiseases. \n14.  Output  2:  Improved  and  standardized  communicable  disease  surveillance  and \ncontrol in participating countries. Central Asian countries endorsed the European Action \nPlan for HIV/AIDS, 2012\u20132015, which aims to reduce the number of new HIV infections.14 \nHowever, because of the limited access to and low uptake of HIV testing and counseling \nservices, it is estimated that up to 60% of people living with HIV in Central Asian countries are \nunaware of being infected.15 Evidence-informed prevention strategies need to be more widely \nadopted  to  control  the  growing  burden  of  HIV  in  Central  Asia.  This  output  will  conduct \nassessments in each participating country on vulnerabilities of populations at risk to access \nservices,  which  is  a  critical  hurdle  for  many  HIV/AIDS-infected  people.  Moreover,  the \nimplementation of standard operating procedures for implementation of core interventions such \nas needle and syringe programs and HIV testing and counseling will be supported under this \noutput.

In line with the approach of strengthening health systems rather than working on single \ndiseases, the output will strengthen surveillance and control of vaccine-preventable diseases. \nThis TA will support implementation and strengthening of case-based surveillance, and support \nestablishment and capacity development of a national verification commission for measles and \nrubella elimination in each participating country. \n \n16.  Output 3: Improved coordination and collaboration among participating countries \nand development partners in planning for and responding to communicable diseases. \nThe IHR provides an excellent framework to strengthen coordination and collaboration across \nsectors within the region and among development partners. One of the key principles promoted \nthrough  the  IHR  is  that  public  health  surveillance  and  response  should  not  interfere  with \ninternational traffic and trade (Art. 2 IHR). To be able to reach this goal, countries are requested \nto develop and strengthen certain health system capacities for surveillance and response, \nespecially at ports, airports, and ground crossings. The IHR also provides instruments to assess \ncross-border public health risks in a standardized manner and encourages bilateral and regional \ncollaboration, regional disease surveillance initiatives, coordinated disaster management, and \nharmonization of legal and regulatory frameworks for transport. \n \n17.  TA activities under output 3 include training national public health experts, improved \ncoordinated surveillance systems, increased cross-sector collaboration, and development of \ncross-border standards and procedures at border crossings. The TA will strengthen awareness \nand advocacy efforts on the importance of the IHR beyond the health sector, particularly in the \ntransport  and  trade  sector.  The  TA  will  also  provide  guidance  notes  in  local  languages. \nMultisector coordination and coordination between points of entry and the national level will be \nimproved through awareness-raising activities for senior officials within the health sector and \nbeyond, in order to increase political commitment to IHR implementation. Regional features on \nIHR core capacity development reported by WHO European member states through the 2011 \nself-assessment questionnaire will be taken into account in the capacity development activities \nunder this TA.16  \n \n18.  A potential risk to successful implementation of the TA is that DMCs may request a \nfurther extension of the deadline beyond 2015 for IHR implementation, which would jeopardize \ntargets established in the TA itself. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,800,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Cooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific,17 and $300,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the People's Republic of China Regional Cooperation and \nPoverty Reduction Fund.18 Both funds will be administered by ADB.  \n \n                                            \n16  Self-assessment data generally tend to overrate actual national capacities but allow the identification of regional \ntrends. The main weakness lies in the area of human resources (regional average score of 35%) followed by \npoints of entry (regional average score of 67%).  \n17  Contributor: the Government of Sweden.  \n18  The Government of the People's Republic of China approved the TA proposal on 1 March 2013.  \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The TA will be implemented from May 2013 to December 2015. Activities related to \nHIV/AIDS prevention and surveillance will be completed before 31 December 2014. While all \nDMCs in Central Asia are invited to participate in the TA, the extent and specifics of activities \nmay vary from country to country based on local needs. ADB will be the executing agency. The \ngovernment counterpart will be the ministries of health. WHO19 will be recruited based on single \nsource selection in accordance with PAI 2.0220 (paras. 63\u201364) and will provide international \nconsultant input (15 person-months, intermittent) and national consultant input (60 person-\nmonths, intermittent) as listed in the terms of reference in Appendix 3. One individual national \nconsultant (12 person-months, intermittent) will be recruited by ADB directly in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) to support \nthe TA implementation at ADB headquarters. Disbursement under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Equipment (including syringes and needles and HIV testing materials) shall be \nprocured by WHO in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n21.   Central and West Asia Department (CWRD), with the support of technical specialists \nfrom Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), will lead the overall TA \nimplementation and coordinate activities and outputs with WHO (as technical lead agency), the \nCAREC  Secretariat,  and  related  project  teams.  A  steering  committee  will  be  formed  with \nrepresentation from relevant departments (CWRD, East Asia Department [EARD], Office of \nRegional  Economic  Integration  [OREI],  and  RSDD)  to  provide  quality  control  and  ensure \nrelevance of project outputs to ADB\u2019s work in regional cooperation and integration. TA review \nwill  be  conducted  annually  or  as  needed.  A  brief  review  will  be  undertaken  following  TA \ninception to assess DMC participation and update key outputs and activities as necessary. A full \naccomplishment  assessment  will  be  undertaken  at  TA  completion  to  report  on  progress \nprevention and control of communicable diseases in participating CAREC countries. The results \nof the TA will be disseminated among participating countries and within ADB through online \nknowledge sharing and country and regional workshops and conferences. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, and \n(ii) ADB administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People's Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction Fund for Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS and other Communicable Diseases in \nCAREC Countries, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n                                            \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n19  WHO has secretarial functions of the IHR within the United Nations (UN) system.
