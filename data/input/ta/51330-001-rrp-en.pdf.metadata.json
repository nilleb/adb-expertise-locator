THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on  (i) a proposed \nloan; and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Republic of Maldives for the South Asia Subregional \nEconomic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  National  Single  Window  (NSW)  Project.  The  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the SASEC NSW Project, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the TA. \n \n2.  The project will leverage information and communication technology (ICT) to improve \nefficiency in cross-border control procedures. It will support the development of an automated \nsystem that will enable sharing of harmonized data across systems of cross-border regulatory \nagencies (CBRAs),1 Maldives Ports Limited (MPL), and Maldives Airports Company Limited \n(MACL). It will also allow traders and other service providers to submit, and to obtain unified \nclearance of export and import documentation requirements through a single point of entry.  The \nreport also describes a TA that will support the Government of Maldives in related capacity \ndevelopment of various stakeholders, including on change management. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Overview of the economy. Maldives is one of the smallest countries in Asia and the \nPacific by population and land area. Its estimated population of 436,330 is widely dispersed over \n188 inhabited islands across an archipelago that is more than 800 kilometers long and 130 \nkilometers wide. Despite its geographical challenges, Maldives has successfully developed many \nislands into high-end tourist resorts. Strong growth in the tourism and tourism-related activities \nhelped the country attain  upper middle-income status in 2010. However, Maldives\u2019 narrow \neconomic  base,  which  is  largely  concentrated  on  tourism,  fisheries,  and  construction,  has \nconstrained its growth prospects. \n \n4.  Importance of international trade. Like other small island economies, Maldives relies \nheavily on imports for food, fuel, and capital goods. From 1995 to 2016 imports accounted for \nabout 60% of gross domestic product. The value of import transactions increased from about \n$268 million in 1995 to more than $2 billion in 2016. Exports, primarily of fresh fish and processed \nfish products, also increased, from $50 million in 1995 to $140 million in 2016. As a share of gross \ndomestic product, however, exports declined from about 11% to about 4% during the same period. \nSouth Asian countries, especially India and Sri Lanka, are major trading partners of Maldives. As \nsuch, improving the trade environment of Maldives and promoting digital exchange of information \namong South Asian countries\u2019 customs authorities are expected to result in expanded trade \namong them. \n \n5.  Maldives performance in trade facilitation. Maldives lags on certain trade facilitation \nindicators and has fallen behind in several rankings despite some progress in 2016\u20132018. In the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2019 report, Maldives\u2019 rank slipped to 155 in terms of trading across \nborders from 152 in 2018.2 The cost of documentary compliance per export transaction is $300, \n                                                \n1  These CBRAs include the Ministry of Economic Development (MED); the Maldives Customs Service (MCS); the \nMaldives Food and Drug Authority; the Ministry of Fisheries, Marine Resources and Agriculture; and the Ministry of \nDefense. \n2  World Bank Group. 2018. Doing Business 2019: Training  for Reform. Washington, D.C.. ", "2 \namong  the  highest  in  South  Asia,  where  the  average  is  $180.  The  cost  of  documentary \ncompliance per import transaction is $180. This is lower than the SASEC subregional average of \n$342, but much higher in comparison with Singapore ($40), one of the Asia and Pacific region\u2019s \nbenchmarks in terms of trade facilitation. While the time for documentary compliance to export \n(48 hours) and import (61 hours) is lower than the averages for South Asia (77 hours for export \nand 105 hours for import), there is still room for improvement compared with Singapore (2 hours \nfor export and 3 hours for import).  \n \n6.  Bottlenecks in trade processes. Procedural and organizational bottlenecks substantially \nhamper the efficient flow of trade transactions and increase costs for traders. These bottlenecks \ninclude (i) paper-based processes, which cause delays and are human resource intensive; (ii) \nunderutilization of existing ICT systems in some CBRAs, such as the Maldives Food and Drug \nAuthority; (iii) overlapping and redundant documentary requirements, which create unnecessary \nworkloads for traders and CBRAs;3 (iv) a physical cargo inspection rate of 100%, which is both \nresource intensive and a source of delays; (v) delays in the release of cargo because of lengthy \nprocedures,  space  and  equipment  constraints  at  Mal\u00e9  commercial  harbor,  and  limited \ninfrastructure for security screening of exports at Mal\u00e9 port and airport; and (vi) other procedural \ninefficiencies within CBRAs.4 \n \n7.  Actions taken by the government. Through a presidential decree issued in September \n2015, the government formed the National Trade Facilitation Committee (NTFC) to promote \ninternational trade, including the introduction of an NSW.5  The NTFC has initiated various \nmodernization and trade facilitation measures, including (i) online submission and processing of \ncustoms declarations, (ii) express channels to expedite customs clearance, (iii) a prepayment \naccount system and simplified customs declaration for individuals, and (iv) upgrading of goods \nclearance toward a paperless trading environment. In line with its Strategic Plan, 2014\u20132018,6 and \nfollowing the government\u2019s policy to lower the rate of customs duties in 2012, the Maldives Customs \nService (MCS) has shifted its focus from tax revenue collection to trade facilitation. New customs \nlegislation was also enacted to implement the World Trade Organization (WTO) Customs Valuation \nAgreement.7 \n \n8.  National single window road map. An NSW is designed to facilitate and establish an \nefficient international trade environment by reducing delays and lowering costs associated with \nclearance of goods, while maintaining the requisite controls and collection of levies, fees, duties, \n                                                \n3  For example, to obtain export and import licenses, traders are required to submit the same information to both the \nMED and the MCS. \n4  ADB.

Manila (TA 8435-REG). \n5  The NTFC was established under the Economic and Youth Council to enhance international trade and improve the \nbusiness environment. It is chaired by the minister of economic development and the members are from the MED, \nthe MCS, the Maldives Food and Drug Authority, MPL, MACL, the Ministry of Tourism, the Attorney General\u2019s Office, \nand the Maldives Inland Revenue Authority. \n6  Government of Maldives, MCS. 2013.

The regulation was approved along with \nthe Maldives Customs Act in 2011 and contains, among others, (i) guidelines on goods importation into and \nexportation from Maldives; (ii) the procedure for appraising the customs value of the goods, which, as specified in \nthe WTO\u2019s Valuation Agreement, is based primarily on the goods transaction value; and (iii) the classification and \ncodification of goods based on Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System of the World Customs \nOrganization (WCO). \n \n ", "3 \nand taxes, where applicable, on imports or exports. The NSW road map8 and business process \nredesign (footnote 4) for the NSW in Maldives were prepared to help improve trading across borders. \nThe  road  map  defines  the  scope  for  business  process  redesign  of  procedures  and  data \nharmonization among the five CBRAs,  MACL,  and  MPL; and  identifies the legal framework \nrequirements and business model options for the NSW operator. The business process redesign \nprovides the design for streamlined procedures within the NSW environment. Maldives\u2019 NSW \ndevelopment  will  follow  international  standards,  as  embodied  in  the  United  Nations \nrecommendations.9 Following common standards is the best way to build interoperability into the \nNSW systems of Maldives and its trading partners.  \n \n9.  The project will establish an NSW in Maldives as an electronic platform, which allows \nparties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardized information and documents at a \nsingle-entry point to fulfill all import- and export-related statutory requirements. The NSW will \nprovide an efficient environment for streamlined international trade procedures between private \nsector  stakeholders  and  border  control  agencies.  This  includes  (i)  a  labor-saving  set  of \nstandardized and transparent international trade procedures, (ii) enhanced border control, and \n(iii) more readily available data on trade flows. The establishment of the NSW is in line with the \noperational priorities for trade facilitation under the SASEC program. The project will foster \nregional  cooperation  and  integration, strengthen governance  and  institutional  capacity,  and \npromote the use of advanced technologies in line with the priorities of ADB Strategy 2030. \n \n10.  Value added by Asian Development Bank assistance. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has been supporting Maldives in preparing and implementing trade facilitation measures \nthrough the  conduct  of  seminars  and  studies on  risk management  of  customs\u2019  clearance, \naccession to the Revised Kyoto Convention,10 and the NSW system. As SASEC secretariat, ADB \norganizes the annual meetings of the SASEC customs subgroup, which discuss and plan national \nand subregional initiatives on modernizing customs administrations, among other things. ADB\u2019s \nprimary  value  addition  is  founded  on  the  sector  knowledge  gained  through  its  long-term \nengagement in trade facilitation in the SASEC countries. The government recognizes ADB\u2019s good \nrecord of translating knowledge into effective advisory and analytical inputs to the government\u2019s \npolicy  formulation.  Through  its  support  for  SASEC,  ADB  also  brings  the  added  value  of \ncomplementing country-level assistance to Maldives\u2019 trade facilitation efforts with subregional \ninitiatives. Since 2001, the ADB-supported SASEC program has provided a platform for member \ncountries to collectively discuss and address trade facilitation issues of subregional concern, \nincluding those identified in the WTO\u2019s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA).11 \n \n11.  Lessons learned. Challenges in previous NSW implementation in other countries (such \nas India) were related to (i) procurement capability, (ii) project management, and (iii) project \nleadership. Addressing procurement and project implementation challenges is crucial since the \nNSW environment requires integration of the NSW system with multiple stakeholders and their \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2018.

TFA aims to expedite the movement, release \nand clearance of goods, to facilitate effective cooperation on trade facilitation and customs compliance issues; and \nto enhance support for capacity building for developing countries. \n \n ", "4 \nsystems.  Experienced  project  management  is essential to coordinate execution  of  multiple \nparallel projects across different organizations. In the context of the project, supervision is also \nimportant given the project\u2019s broad scope, and the risks of misalignment with desired deliverables. \nThere  is  a  need for a project champion  to  effectively  mobilize  the  multiple  ministries  and \ngovernment agencies. Incorporating these lessons, ADB will assist the government to implement \ninstitutional reform by providing support for change management through the attached TA. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) efficient international trade facilitation \nensured;12 and (ii) faster, cheaper, and more predictable cross-border trade in the SASEC \nsubregion achieved.13 The project will have the following outcome: efficiency in cargo clearance \nimproved.14 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: National single window system for international trade and reengineered \ntrade processes established. The nationwide online system that provides for all relevant parties \nto submit standardized information at a single-entry point to fulfill all import, export, and transit-\nrelated regulatory requirements will be established in two phases. In the first phase, systems of \nthe agencies which show high readiness,15 will be interfaced with the NSW system. The systems \nof the rest of the CBRAs will be connected in the second phase. The capacity building for \noperation and maintenance will be provided under the project. Business processes reengineering \nmeasures to streamline international procedures will be implemented. By project completion in \n2023, the local NSW operator will be fully responsible for operations of the NSW. \n \n14.  Output 2: Capacity of relevant agencies and private sector users, including women, \nto utilize the national single window developed. This output will be financed by the TA and \nincludes (i) supporting the government in finalizing the NSW framework and e-transaction bill, (ii) \ndeveloping and implementing a change management strategy, capacity development plan, and \nNSW operations manual to increase buy-in and capacity of CBRAs and other relevant agencies \nto utilize the NSW; and (iii) outreach to private sectors, including women in inner and outer atolls.  \nThe NSW Operator will also set up a helpdesk to assist NSW users. \n  \n15.  Output 3: High-level technologies to support national single window and trade \nfacilitation pilot tested. This output will be financed by the TA and includes pilot testing the \napplication of blockchain, a high-level technology that enables users to track shipping items and \nrecord all related documentation history on its distributed ledger without a chance of falsification. \nBlockchain has the potential to be adopted as the future operating system of the NSW system. \nAn e-payment gateway platform\u2014a component of the NSW to be connected to e-payment \nsystems\u2014functions as a hub and simplifies the processing of payment transactions for electronic \nservices. The project will disseminate pilot-testing results, raise awareness, and build knowledge \nand capacity of the officials of all agencies related to the NSW system, to familiarize them with \nrelevant blockchain and e-payment applications.  \n                                                \n12  Government of Maldives, MED. 2013.

Technical due diligence confirmed that designs are robust and sustainable and included \na comprehensive review of the project feasibility study, system designs, and cost estimates. \nTechnical aspects of the project were appraised based on (i) rationale and relevance, benefits, \nproposed  designs,  and  ease  of  implementation  and  operations;  (ii)  a  range  of  technical \nalternatives and their viability along with least-cost analysis; (iii) the life cycle costs, including \ncapital and operating costs, and achievable cost savings; (iv) maximization of beneficiary area \ncoverage including the poor; and (v) optimization of timelines for implementation through high \nproject readiness. NSW objectives and effectiveness act as a catalyst toward comprehensive \nstreamlining of procedures by CBRAs and automated processing. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The analysis was prepared using a cost\u2013benefit analysis approach in accordance with \nADB guidelines. 20 The main project benefits are time and resource savings. Benefits arise from \nstreamlined business processes that reduce time spent on processing trade documents and their \nassociated costs, including reproduction, storage, archiving, filing, and processing. Time savings \nto traders and CBRAs are derived from less frequent visits to CBRAs, including queueing at \napplication and payment windows. Importers, forwarders, and goods processors would spend \nless time for cargo release and travel costs associated with these tasks. Benefits also derive from \nother avoided costs involving stakeholder transport and travel, and lost time to other productive \nendeavors and leisure. Reduced time and cost are also likely to increase trade volumes. \n \n25.  Economic costs are derived from financial costs using shadow exchange rate factors. \nUsing a social discount rate of 9%, the project has a mean economic net present value of $3.57 \nmillion and a mean economic internal rate of return of 13.6%. These benefits, combined with \nunquantifiable benefits will more than compensate for the overall cost attributed to the project. \nRisk analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to account for project risks and \nuncertainties.21 The results showed a probability of less than 15% that the project would not \nachieve the ADB standard economic opportunity cost of capital of 9%. \n                                                \n18  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19  Financing partner:  Government of Japan. \n20  ADB. 2017.

Financial management. The financial management risk of the project is rated substantial. \nHowever, based on the financial management assessment, MED\u2019s overall financial management \narrangements are adequate to implement the project with the proposed mitigation measures. In \naddition, the MED is already familiar with ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures since it served as the \nimplementing agency for the Inclusive Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development \nProject.22 A project monitoring unit will be established under the MED. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). The government has been informed of ADB\u2019s \npublic disclosure requirement on audited project financial statements. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  Poverty. Overall poverty of 7.3% (2009) along with widening income inequality and \nunemployment is still a major issue in Maldives.23 The implementation of an NSW is estimated to \ngenerate $17 million annual savings for both the government and the private sector through lower \ntransaction costs.24 These additional resources can be utilized for better provision of, and greater \naccess to, public services serving a bigger segment of the population, particularly those in the \nouter atolls where poverty incidence is high. The NSW will also reduce the overall costs of \ntransactions by cutting retail prices of imported staple goods, such as food and fuel, thereby \nbenefiting consumers, especially low-income people. In addition, the project will strengthen and \nimprove the ease of doing business environment and facilitate private sector development, which \nare deemed crucial for employment creation and economic growth. \n \n29.  Gender. The project is categorized some gender elements. Women\u2019s participation in trade \nand other economic fields remains low in Maldives because of, among other things, geographic \ndispersion, traditions, customs, and the institutional environment. While an NSW will not address \nthis directly, it will support creating a women-friendly environment to improve their access to trade-\nrelated services. An NSW will help women traders and entrepreneurs to effectively use their time \nin managing both business and domestic responsibilities. An NSW will also espouse a gender-\nneutral environment since the CBRAs and the NSW operator will be bound by service-level \nagreements that will require them to deliver and perform within an expected level of performance \nfor all clients regardless of gender. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.25 \n                                                \n22  ADB. 2012.
