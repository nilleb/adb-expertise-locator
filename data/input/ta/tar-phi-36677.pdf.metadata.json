The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the improvement of basic \neducation  in  Mindanao  since  the  mid-1990s  through  the  ongoing  Secondary  Education \nDevelopment and Improvement Project, and studies and other activities to prepare for the \nproposed Mindanao Basic Education Development Project.1 The Government of the Philippines \nplaces high priority on the development of Mindanao, and recently launched the Mindanao \nNational Initiative that aims to foster equity, stability, and uplifting of the Mindanao people. \nMindanao is one of ADB\u2019s priority geographic areas in the Philippines, given its high poverty \nincidence  and  low  levels  of  social  development.  The  poorest  part  of  Mindanao  is  the \nAutonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). \n \n2.  To  prepare  a  solid  foundation  for  improving  the  ARMM  education  system,  the \nGovernment has requested advisory technical assistance (TA) from ADB to help the ARMM \nDepartment of Education (DepEd-ARMM) prepare a comprehensive plan for basic education \ndevelopment to respond to the specific educational needs of children. The Government has \nconcurred with the goals, purpose, outputs, scope, implementation arrangements, costs and \nfinancing of the TA, and the terms of reference of the consultants.2 The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ARMM was created in 1991 and covers the five provinces of Basilan, Lanao del Sur, \nMaguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi Tawi; and the city of Marawi. The population in 2000 was 2.87 \nmillion  or  3.8%  of  the  national  population.  Muslims  are  the  dominant  social  group  (76%), \nfollowed by Christians (11%), and indigenous people (13%). The poverty incidence, at 71% in \n2000, is the highest in the country, and almost doubles the national average of 40%. Average \nhousehold income is about 57% of the national average; life expectancy is 10 years less, and \ninfant mortality is 30% higher. These disturbing figures are reflected in the net enrolment rates \nin basic education, which are the lowest in the country. The initial poverty and social analysis is \nin Appendix 2. \n \n4.  Education  in  ARMM  is  marked  by  a  long  history  of  deprivation  and  underfunding, \nresulting in levels of educational development far below the Millennium Development Goals for \neducation, and well below national achievements. The elementary net enrollment rate in 2001 \nwas 82% compared with the national average of 96%, and the secondary school participation \nrate was the lowest in the country (39% in 2001, compared with the national average of 72%). \nThe cohort survival rate of 40% at the elementary level is only half of the country\u2019s, while a \nmaximum of only 20% of children who begin elementary school complete secondary schooling.3  \n \n5.  Most children in ARMM are enrolled in public schools, but many also attend madrasah \non weekends for religious education. Madrasah are privately operated Islamic schools covering \nmainly primary education. There are 440 madrasah, of which only 44 are accredited, with a \npupil population of almost 90,000. Most concentrate on Islamic religious and cultural teachings, \nwith Arabic as the medium of instruction. The graduates of madrasah have difficulty finding \nemployment because they are weak in Filipino, English, and numeracy. A small number of \n                                                 \n1  The project preparatory TA for the Mindanao Basic Education Development Project was conducted during 1996\u2013\n1997, with follow-up work carried out in 2000. Further development of the project has been postponed.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 28 October 2003. \n3  Data from World Bank. November 2003. Human Development for Peace and Prosperity in the Autonomous Region \nin Muslim Mindanao. Manila. ", "2 \nmadrasah  (around  35)  offer  the  national  basic  education  curriculum  along  with  religious \neducation, and are accredited by the Government. The sector is diverse, as each madrasah \noperates  independently  and  curricula  vary  considerably  according  to  the  background  and \ncountry of training of the operators and teachers.   \n  \n6.  The Organic Law (Republic Act 6734) that created ARMM in 1991 identifies, as a top \npriority, the establishment of \u201ca complete and integrated system of quality education\u201d and the \nadoption of \u201can educational framework that is relevant and responsive to the needs, ideals, and \naspirations of the people in the region.\u201d The ARMM government faces many difficulties in \nmeeting this mandate. The long-running conflict situation, widespread poverty, large number of \npoorly educated youth and adults, diversity of the population including indigenous groups, lack \nof decentralization in education management, a curriculum that is seen by many as not relevant \nfor  ARMM  in  many  respects,  and  a  serious  lack  of  funding  for  education  present  severe \nchallenges. A perceived conflict between preparing students for citizenship in the Filipino nation \nand preparing them for membership in the ARMM Islamic community has resulted in a two-tier \nsystem of public schools and madrasah. Pressure is growing now for schools and madrasah to \nbe put on a more even footing, as reflected in the goal for basic education recently formulated \nby DepEd-ARMM \"to achieve good quality, relevant basic education for pupils in both public \nschools and madrasah, and contribute meaningfully to peace and nation building.\"4 Divisions \nare unresolved over the goals of basic education in relation to nation building, and finding a \nbalance between preparing students for their future lives as Muslim residents of ARMM and as \ncitizens of the Philippines. Related to this is the ongoing discussion on the future role of \nmadrasah education. The challenge is to build an education system that is relevant to ARMM \nand sensitive to religious values and diversity, but also prepares students to take part in the life \nof the nation.   \n \n7.  These overarching issues are compounded in schools by a set of resource-related \nissues including a lack of classrooms and teachers, especially at the secondary level; continuing \ndeterioration of school buildings; a shortage of teaching and learning materials; limited funding \nfor school operations and professional development of principals and teachers; poor quality \nteaching; and frequent disruptions to schooling caused by the conflict. Improved local level \nplanning  and  management  through  implementation  of  the  new  law  on  decentralized  basic \neducation management could help alleviate some of these problems.    \n \n 8.  Several ongoing foreign-assisted projects support education in ARMM.5 The involvement \nof different aid organizations is welcomed by DepEd-ARMM, while recognizing that a clear \nframework  is  needed  to  coordinate  these  efforts,  and  ensure  consistency  and  relevance. \nDepEd-ARMM therefore wishes to prepare a comprehensive basic education development plan \nthat  will  address  ARMM\u2019s  diverse  educational  needs  and  provide  a  framework  to  guide \neducation development. The Government has requested assistance to develop, operationalize, \nand cost a comprehensive but feasible basic education development plan; and to improve the \ncapacity of the region to implement such a plan. \n   \n                                                 \n4  As a first step in the development of an education plan specifically for ARMM, DepEd-ARMM has produced a \nschematic outline of a 10-year education master plan with the assistance of the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment. \n5  Those currently providing support to ARMM include the Secondary Education Development Project (ADB and \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation); the Basic Education Assistance in Mindanao Project (Australian Agency \nfor International Development); the ARMM Social Fund (World Bank); and the Growth with Equity in Mindanao \nProject II (United States Agency for International Development).  ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The long-term goal of the TA is to improve access to, and the quality of, education in the \nARMM. The main purpose is to improve the capacity of DepEd-ARMM to plan and manage the \ndevelopment of basic education effectively, in a new decentralized context. The output of the TA \nwill be the ARMM 10-year basic education development plan, 2005\u20132015 (BEDP). The BEDP \nwill focus on strategies for closing the education gap between ARMM and the rest of the \ncountry. Specific proposals to meet future investment needs, based on the BEDP, will also be \ndeveloped.  \n \nB.  Methodology, Approach, and Key Activities \n \n10.  The BEDP will be based on the Organic Act for the Republic Act 9054, which states that \nMuslim  culture,  mores,  customs,  and  traditions  will  be  integrated  and  preserved  in  the \ncurriculum of public schools. The BEDP will also be anchored on the vision and goals of the \nnational Education for All Plan 2015. In formulating the Plan, DepEd-ARMM will consult widely \nwith  local  education  managers,  local  government  units,  the  madrasah  education  sector, \nbusinesses, and communities. This will help ensure ownership of the BEDP among various \nsections of the community.  \n \n11.  The  BEDP  will  cover  the  needs  of  the  entire  basic  education  system:  preschool \neducation,  elementary  and  secondary  education,  nonformal  education,  and  madrasah \neducation. A central theme will be the integration of public schools and madrasah into one \ncohesive, regional education system. Strategies for upgrading teacher education and for raising \neducation quality through the involvement of reputable regional universities will be identified. For \neach  of  these  areas,  the  BEDP  will  outline  basic  goals;  determine  priorities;  and  identify \nminimum standards, key result areas, and targets. Action plans for each area will be developed, \nand  the  resource  requirements  specified.  Separate  division  education  development  plans \n(DEDPs) will be formulated on the basis of the plan, as well as a system for monitoring BEDP \nimplementation. \n \n12.  A key feature of the BEDP will be the identification of empirical targets and estimates of \nthe associated budgetary requirements. The setting of targets will be based upon a realistic \nassessment of what can be implemented given current human resources, the ongoing conflict \nsituation,  and  the  financial  resources  likely  to  be  available.  The  BEDP  will  project  future \nbudgetary needs based on different scenarios, covering what would be required to close the \neducation gap between ARMM and the rest of the country and to reach Education for All goals. \nOne important aspect of this exercise will be the improvement of policy decision-making, by \nintroducing resource requirements and resource availability as a critical element. \n \n13.  Cross-sector issues identified by the ARMM Government as key to upgrading the quality \nand relevance of basic education will also be addressed, including the decentralization of \neducation management, and improved resource management. Two other areas the ARMM \nGovernment  regards  as  critical,  the  development  of  a  nationally  accredited  curriculum  for \nmadrasah, and the establishment of a regional information management system, are being \nsupported by the Basic Education Assistance in Mindanao Project funded by the Australian \nAgency for International Development. \n ", "4 \n14.  The  TA  will  support  a  training  program  for  key  personnel  on  BEDP  and  project \nimplementation, funds management and reporting, and monitoring and evaluation. To ensure \nthe relevance, credibility, and acceptance of the BEDP, the formulation process will involve all \nrelevant stakeholders including regional and division education officials, principals and teachers, \nmadrasah operators and teachers, local government, students, parents, and the community. \nThe national DepEd will remain involved throughout the process to help ensure that national \nstandards are met, and that lessons learned are spread to other areas of Mindanao. \n \n15.  The major activities required to accomplish these objectives include (i) reviewing the \neducation data currently available; (ii) developing a survey to validate or gather additional \nschool  date,  if  necessary;  (iii)  identifying  key  issues  in  ARMM  education;  (iv)  clarifying \noutstanding policy issues; (v) helping the Government to identify the roles and responsibilities of \nthe different levels of the ARMM education system within a decentralized environment (region, \ndivisions and schools); (vi) developing guidelines and handbooks to guide the decentralization \nof education management and an associated capacity-building program; (vii) developing DEDPs \nfor  each  division;  (viii)  training  DepEd-ARMM  personnel  in  education  planning  and  project \nmanagement; (ix) reviewing ARMM education financing and consulting with national and local \ngovernment agencies, the private sector, and civil society to identify possible new funding \nsources; (x) developing a draft 10-year BEDP covering basic education and teacher education; \n(xi) conducting extensive workshops to develop consensus on plan priorities, including major \nexternal agencies active in ARMM; (xii) preparing a costed, prioritized plan. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $535,000 equivalent, of which $185,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $350,000 equivalent the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested financing of $375,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$190,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Australia. The Australian funds will be administered by ADB. The Government \nwill finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $160,000, through the provision \nof counterpart staff; local travel for staff; office accommodation; administrative and secretarial \nsupport; and use of printers, photocopiers, and telephones. Details of the cost estimates are in \nAppendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented by DepEd-ARMM, and will be located in the Planning Office. \nThe TA will strengthen the capacity of the Planning Office by involving staff in development of \nthe BEDP, on-the\u2013job training with the consultants, and formal training workshops. A program \nsteering committee will provide policy guidance to the TA, to be chaired by the secretary, \nDepEd-ARMM  and  vice-chaired  by  the  director  of  the  ARMM  Regional  Planning  and \nDevelopment Office with membership from national DepEd, other involved agencies, and the \nmadrasah sector. The responsibilities of the steering committee are defined in Appendix 4. The \nBureau of Madaris6 will be involved in developing the BEDP with the active participation of \nmadrasah operators and teachers.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months (April 2005\u2013March 2006), with frequent \nworkshops and consultation meetings. Technical working groups will work with the consultants \n                                                 \n6 Madaris is commonly used as the plural form of madrasah in ARMM. ", "    5 \non the BEDP, the decentralization guidelines and handbooks, and preparation of the training \nprograms. \n   \n19.   The TA will require 5 person-months of international and 10 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services in education planning and education management. Using ADB\u2019s quality- and \ncost-based selection method, international and domestic consultants will be recruited through a \nconsulting firm using a simplified technical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. The consulting firm will be responsible for organizing and facilitating all \nworkshops and procuring equipment. Procurement under the TA will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Outline terms of reference for the consultants, including \nreporting requirements, are in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $375,000 to the Government \nof the Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia for the \nDevelopment of Basic Education in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in the Philippines:   \nInadequate education is one of the most powerful determinants of poverty, and unequal access to educational \nopportunity is a strong correlate of income inequality. \nThe basic education indicators for the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) are the lowest in the \nPhilippines. Net enrollment rates in primary and secondary education are just 82% and 39% respectively, while the \nprimary school completion rate of 40% is just over half that of the rest of the country. Low levels of education lead to \njoblessness, poverty, and alienation from mainstream Philippine society.  \nThe education system in ARMM receives only low levels of government funding, but has recently begun to attract \nfunding from external sources. To ensure that government and aid resources are used efficiently and effectively, for \nboth public schools and madrasah, a basic education development plan (BEDP) is needed to plan the development of \nbasic education in ARMM. This will help ensure quality education for poor children and achievement of the millennium \ndevelopment goal of ensuring that all children complete a full course of primary education by 2015.   \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention  \nThe incidence of poverty in ARMM is among the highest in the Philippines, with 71% of the population living in poverty \nin 2000 (national incidence 40%). This is linked to the long-standing armed conflict led by Muslim groups fighting for \nan independent Mindanao, with consequent upheaval of the population, fear and insecurity among people living in \naffected areas, and low levels of investment and economic development.  \nImproving levels of basic education attainment will help fight poverty. In ARMM, the challenge is to ensure that \nchildren complete the education cycle while receiving a good quality education. Strategies for improving completion \nrates will form an important part of the BEDP, and may include programs for identifying and supporting children at risk \nof dropout, flexible school schedules or special programs for children who are often absent from school, remedial \nprograms, and school health clinics or school feeding programs.  \nBy giving children a stronger educational foundation, transition rates to post-basic education will increase. Higher \neducational levels are positively associated with better incomes and lower poverty levels, as well as better life skills. \nSpecial attention will be paid to the needs of girls who are slightly outnumbered by boys in schools, unlike in the rest of \nthe Philippines. \n \n \nC.

Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: A gender strategy will be incorporated into the BEDP. In schools, fewer \ngirls than boys are enrolled (49% versus 51%). A similar situation exists for madrasah. At the level of school \nprincipals, men also dominate. The TA will pay special attention to how to address the needs of girls in schools and \nmadrasah, including community advocacy campaigns, and how to increase the number of female teachers and \nprincipals.
