In a number of developing countries in the Asia and Pacific region, financial services for \npoor and low-income households have grown significantly over the last two decades. The \nfinancial institutions serving these households, which are largely concentrated in rural areas, \nhave expanded the scope of their services to include taking deposits as well as offering credit. \nIn Cambodia, only one microfinance institution (MFI)\u2014ACLEDA (Association of Cambodian \nLocal  Economic  Development  Agencies)  Bank1\u2014has  undergone  this  transformation  from \nmicrocredit to microfinance. None of the other MFIs has added voluntary deposit services to its \ncredit operations.2 As noted by a recent review by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor \n(CGAP),3 the development of deposit services has significantly lagged behind credit services, \ndespite  the  recognition  by  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  that  developing  deposit \nservices in rural areas is critical to building inclusive and demand-driven financial systems for \nthe poor. In response to a request for advisory technical assistance (TA), a concept paper was \ndeveloped and endorsed for funding in the amount of $600,000 by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund in August 2005. An Asian Development Bank (ADB) fact-finding mission \nvisited  Cambodia  from  6  to  13  October  2005,  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment on the impact, outcomes, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference of the TA.4 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.   Over 80% of Cambodia\u2019s 13.8 million people live in rural areas. Most rural households \nlack access to a broad range of financial services, although in the last decade their access to \ncredit facilities has expanded. With support from donors and investors, licensed MFIs and \nACLEDA Bank served over 450,000 borrowers in 2005, nine times more than in 1995. However, \nmost rural households, especially poor and low-income households, do not have access to \ndeposit services. Savings services allow people to accumulate reserves, reduce risks, build \nproductive  assets,  improve  credit-worthiness,  smooth  their  consumption  expenses,  take \nadvantage of economic opportunities, finance major expenditures such as school fees and \nmedical expenses, and improve the quality of their lives.  \n \n3.         In the absence of appropriate services from formal institutions,5 rural households rely on \ninformal mechanisms for saving. Some participate in rotating savings and credit associations \n(ROSCAs), but most save cash at home.6  Rural households also save in assets such as gold \nand livestock. An increasing number of rural households participate in informal community \nfinancial groups, despite the fact that many such groups \u201care not providing safe or convenient \n                                                 \n1  ACLEDA started as a nongovernment organization (NGO) operating in microfinance in 1993, became a specialized \nbank in 2000, and a commercial bank in 2003. \n2  Even though there is no NBC regulation that prohibits MFIs to take voluntary deposits from the public, to introduce \nand expand voluntary deposit services is difficult because of (i) lack of trust in financial institutions, and (ii) ample \nfunding from donors and social-minded investors. \n3  Flaming, M. et. al. 2005. Country Level Effectiveness and Accountability Review: Cambodia. Washington D.C.: \nCGAP (p.6). \n4  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 28 October 2005. \n5  Normally, MFIs provide compulsory savings related to loans. Some MFIs provide voluntary savings for their \nmembers only, but most voluntary savings products have been unsuccessful. \n6  Matthews, B. 2005.  Toward Safety and Self Reliance:  Community Finance and Public Trust in Rural Cambodia:   \nCanada,  Canadian Cooperative Association (CCA).  \n ", " 2 \nsaving services\u201d.7 Most community financial groups have severe limitations on withdrawal of \nmembers\u2019 savings and some do not pay any interest on deposits. The fact that there are over \n60,000 members of community financial groups shows people\u2019s need for saving facilities. \n \n4.          In  recent  years,  most  licensed  MFIs  have  realized  the  significance  of  providing \nvoluntary deposit services to rural households. Many have reduced their compulsory savings \noperations because they have increasingly recognized that rural households do not value such \nprograms.8 MFIs have also felt the need to mobilize deposits to increase the funds they could \nloan and to reduce their cost of funds. One MFI, for example, is currently exploring how it can \nmobilize voluntary deposits primarily to respond to its increasing cost of funds. Another is \nlooking into how it can reduce its dependence on donor funds to finance the growth in its loan \nportfolio. However, most MFIs lack the capacity to enter the deposit market successfully and, in \na rush to enter the market, some have introduced ill-designed products to test the market \npotential. None of the licensed MFIs has been able to introduce client-driven, voluntary deposit \nservices effectively.    \n \n5.         MFIs with a commitment to introducing deposit services face many other constraints. \nFirst, most do not clearly understand the NBC\u2019s position on regulation of voluntary deposit \nmobilization. NBC has not issued detailed regulatory requirements for deposit operations. The \nlimited capacity of the supervision department of NBC to regulate and supervise licensed MFIs \neffectively will be a critical issue when they begin to expand their deposit operations. Most MFIs \ndo not have appropriate software to deal with transactions related to voluntary deposits. They \nhave been credit-only institutions for many years and have no institutional culture of deposit \ntaking. Their staff will need to be trained to carry out deposit operations.  \n \n6.        There are a number of demand-side issues in the deposit market in rural areas. First, \nmost rural households lack experience of dealing with the financial sector. Second, most low-\nincome households do not trust banking institutions to keep their savings safely. A program to \nenhance financial literacy is needed. Without demand-side interventions of this kind, reliance on \na supply-led approach to deposit service development is unlikely to produce significant results.    \n \n7.        Developing deposit services in rural areas will contribute to poverty reduction, since \npoverty in Cambodia is essentially rural. According to the poverty assessment,9 rural poverty \nincidence  is  40\u201345%.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  \u201cRectangular  Strategy\u201d,  the  Country \nStrategy and Program (CSP), 2005\u20132009, focuses on three pillars: (i) broad-based economic \ngrowth,  (ii)  inclusive  social  development,  and  (iii)  good  governance.  In  the  first  pillar, \ndevelopment of the financial sector and sustainable development of small- and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) are major components. As microfinance is a part of the financial system, \ndeveloping  deposit  services  will  enable  MFIs  to  perform  their  main  function  as  financial \nintermediaries  effectively,  contributing  to  financial  sector  development.  In  addition,  savings \nmobilization  can  create  an  opportunity  for  re-lending  to  the  community,  thus,  enhancing \nprospects for development of SMEs.   \n \n8.  Access to financial services is critical if poor people are to participate in and benefit from \ndevelopment. In the context of regional cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), \nmicrofinance development in Cambodia has the potential to be an example for other transitional \n                                                 \n7  Matthews, B., 2004. \u201cREFLECT\u201d and Internal Control of Community Finance Institutions in Cambodia.

In most cases, compulsory \nsavings have no interest rates. \n9  ADB.  2005.  Country Strategy and Program (CSP):  2005 \u2013 2009.  Cambodia.  Manila. \n ", "3 \neconomies. ADB has had a strong presence in the microfinance sector since late 1990s,10 \nalthough it has not provided any capacity building TA to the microfinance sector since late 2002. \nSupport for voluntary savings and capacity building for NBC and MFIs is therefore timely and \nwill build on the lessons learned from previous TA.11  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA is expected to reduce the vulnerability of the poor to external shocks and to \nimprove financial intermediation by MFIs. Its outcomes will be increased level of savings in rural \nhouseholds, and increased availability of funds for MFIs so they can expand rural lending. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  have  three  components:  (i) development  of regulatory  and  supervisory \ncapacity of NBC for deposit-taking MFIs, (ii) support to MFIs for the provision of deposit services, \nand  (iii)  a  financial  literacy  program  to  increase  awareness  of  rural  households.  The  first \ncomponent includes helping NBC to issue detailed regulations, including prudential norms, for \ndeposit-taking MFIs, and providing on-the-job training for staff in an MFI supervision unit. The \nsecond component includes (i) conducting a national survey12 on savings habits, practices and \npotential in rural Cambodia; (ii) conducting training workshops for MFIs on voluntary deposit \nmobilization; (iii) providing assistance to selected licensed MFIs to introduce deposit services \nsuitable for low-income households, such as training on product development, pricing, and \nmarketing, and pilot-testing; and (iv) identifying the implications of savings mobilization on \nmanagement information systems (MIS) in MFIs.  \n \n11  The third component, a program to increase the financial awareness of rural households, \nincludes providing support to (i) NBC to carry out a national awareness campaign for school \nchildren to promote savings habits; (ii) MFIs to carry out a national awareness campaign for \nrural households; (iii) CARE Cambodia, an NGO, to carry out an awareness campaign for \ngarment factory workers; and (iv) Cambodia Community Financial Institutions Network (CCFIN), \na network of NGOs, to carry out an awareness campaign among its members in the rural areas. \n \n12.  The development of the regulatory and supervisory capacity of NBC for deposit-taking \nMFIs, the provision of detailed prudential regulations, and improved capacity of supervision staff \nwill result in sounder MFI operations and greater confidence from the public. The national \ndemand survey in rural villages will identify the ways the poor save, and their need for deposit \nservices. The results will help determine the most appropriate types of deposit products. The \nsurvey  will  have  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  elements,  and  will  include  focus  group \ndiscussions. The survey team will be recruited by ADB.  \n \n13.  Pilot testing will test savings products in small areas, with a view to extending the pilot \nprojects if they are successful. There will be four main activities of the awareness creation \ncampaign. Experience in other countries indicates that building awareness of saving habits \n                                                 \n10 Loan 1741 (ADB. 2000).

Building awareness among Cambodia\u2019s \n230,000 garment factory workers also has considerable potential. Most workers come from the \nvillages, and they regularly send money to support their families. With many workers having \nclose ties to rural areas and a regular source of income, if they save with formal financial \ninstitutions such as licensed MFIs, this will benefit both themselves and their families.  \n \n14.  MFIs  that  plan  to  pilot  voluntary  savings  products  should  have  the  following \ncharacteristics: (i) an ability to practice the level of tracking and management analysis required \nby  a  new  product;  (ii)  a  clear  understanding  of  the  capacity  requirements  in  all  relevant \ndepartments; (iii) the capacity to review and assess their institutional strategy, financial viability, \norganizational  structure,  human  resources,  and  marketing  system;  (iv)  support  from  \nmanagement and the board; and (v) staff who can manage, implement, and develop the new \nproduct, and who can train other staff.13\n \n15.  The consultants will screen proposals on pilot projects proposed by MFIs and make \nrecommendations to ADB. ADB will select three MFIs that will conduct one pilot project each in \nthe areas they choose. The consultants will (i) help MFIs to market deposit products in areas \nchosen  for the  pilot  projects;  (ii) conduct  at least  nine participatory  workshops  on  deposit \nproducts with key stakeholders; (iii) help participating MFIs to submit quarterly reviews of the \nprogress of the pilot projects, indicating potential problems and suggesting solutions; (iv) help \nMFIs  to  produce  reports  outlining  product  design,  marketing,  distribution  methods, \naccomplishments, lessons learned from the pilots, and recommendations for next steps; and \n(v) hold a conference presenting the results and recommendations of the pilots. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $720,000, comprising a foreign exchange cost of \n$331,000 and a local currency cost of $389,000 equivalent. The Government has asked ADB to \nfinance $600,000, including the entire foreign exchange cost and $269,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund will finance the TA through a \ngrant, which ADB will administer. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency \ncost, equivalent to $120,000, by providing office accommodation, transport, remuneration and \nper diem of counterparts, and administrative support. The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  NBC will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA. A steering committee, chaired by \nNBC, will be established, and will include members from NBC and a representative from the \nCambodia Microfinance Association (CMA). The tasks of the steering committee will include \n(i) providing  guidance  and  recommendations  to  the  consultants,  and  (ii)  reviewing  and \ncommenting on TA outputs. The steering committee is expected to meet quarterly during TA \nimplementation. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 20 months from May 2006 to December 2007. The \nimplementation of pilot projects will cover 12 months from January to December 2007. Individual \ninternational and domestic consultants will be selected to implement the TA. Implementation will \n                                                 \n13  McCord, M.J., G. Wright, and D. Cracknell. 2003. A Toolkit for Planning, Conducting, and Monitoring Pilot Tests, \nKenya.

All procurement under the TA will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n19.  The consultants will prepare detailed work plans including a timetable for deliverables \ndefined under the TA, in consultation with NBC, before the start of the services. The consultants \nwill be required to submit an inception report 2 weeks after beginning the TA. The first interim \nreport will be submitted 12 weeks after the submission of the inception report and will be \nreviewed by NBC and ADB. The second interim report will be submitted in December 2006. A \ndraft final report summarizing the results of the pilot projects and recommendations will be \nsubmitted in October 2007. A tripartite meeting will be held before finalizing the draft final report. \nThe final report, incorporating comments of NBC and ADB during and after the tripartite meeting, \nwill be submitted 1 month after the draft final report. At the country level, results from the pilot \nprojects will be disseminated through a conference with participation by representatives from \nNBC,  MFIs,  and  donors.
