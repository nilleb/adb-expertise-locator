INTRODUCTION\n1. The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support Pacific developing\nmember countries (DMCs) to strengthen energy reforms through the Office of Pacific Energy\nRegulators  Alliance  (OPERA)1 by  undertaking  national  and  regional  capacity  building  and\ngenerating and sharing knowledge. The TA will enable Asian Development Bank (ADB) to meet\nemerging requests for analytical support from Pacific DMCs in undertaking annual review of\nenergy regulation and tariffs. The TA will focus on strengthening the regulation of power utilities\nto promote clean energy technologies that will help decarbonize Pacific economies and achieve\nnationally determined contribution (NDC) targets.2 It will assist in the preparation of regulation\nreforms that embed market-based incentives for attracting private participation in the energy\nsector. The TA will also raise the awareness of emerging regional issues and challenges in\nattracting private investment in the energy sector, including the use of public\u2013private partnership\n(PPP) transparency frameworks to develop a more efficient and transparently regulated power\nsector.\n2. This TA aligns with ADB Strategy 2030 priorities, particularly in its emphasis on major\nglobal commitments, such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on\nclimate change. It emphasizes ADB\u2019s role as (i) a regional knowledge provider focused on\nproviding practical solutions that fit local conditions, identifying lessons, and replicating good\npractices across the Pacific and beyond; and (ii) a convener of energy sector stakeholders (e.g.,\nregulators, private sector, and development partners) to promote dialogue and collaboration.\nEnhanced regulation will contribute to achieving ADB Strategy 2030\u2019s goal of supporting small\nisland  developing  states  in  improving  the  business  environment,  reforming  state-owned\nenterprises, enhancing PPPs to reduce the cost of doing business, strengthening the quality of\npublic service delivery, and promoting private sector-led growth.3 The TA is closely aligned with\nADB\u2019s operational priorities of fostering regional cooperation and integration (operational priority\n[OP]  7);  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  (OP1);  strengthening  governance  and\ninstitutional capacity (OP4); and tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience,\nand enhancing environmental sustainability (OP3). The TA is included in the Pacific Regional\nOperations  Business  Plan  2021-2023  and  is  aligned  with  the  Pacific  Renewable  Energy\nInvestment Facility.4\nII. ISSUES\n3. Renewable energy has the potential to transform the Pacific energy market. The global\ndeployment of renewable energy in recent years has been increasing very rapidly, mostly due to\nnew technologies and a drastic decline in investment costs. In addition to highly competitive\nrenewable energy generation, battery energy storage technologies are becoming more available\nand affordable as a solution to balancing the intermittency of solar and wind power and to\nimproving network reliability and stability.5 The potential of solar rooftop photovoltaic, microgrids,\nand decentralized energy supply calls for new business models and policy and regulatory reforms\n1  DMCs which will be supported are OPERA founding members (Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu),\nPacific Island countries which also joined the alliance (Cook Islands, Fiji, Palau, Papua New Guinea ,\nSolomon Islands), and other Pacific DMCs (Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia,\nNauru, Niue, Tuvalu).\n2  Regional Pacific NDC Hub. 2021.

Manila.  \n5  International Renewable Energy Agency. 2021. Tracking SDG7. The Energy Progress Report. Washington, DC. ", "2 \nin Pacific DMCs.6 The private sector has significant potential in the Pacific to bring innovation and \nscale up investment, while the public sector seeks to improve the regulatory environment for \nprivate  sector  participation  and  use  market-based  incentives.  As  such,  there  are  many \nopportunities for Pacific DMCs to move away from traditional state utility-dominated models by \ndeveloping PPPs to achieve sustainable and cleaner energy. Experiences in other ADB DMCs \nshow that progressive regulation and tariff reforms can be pivotal in attracting private investment \nin renewable energy and to compete with other generation sources.7 \n4. Limited private sector participation in energy. Pacific DMCs are committed to a shared\nvision for the region\u2019s energy sector and the development of an enabling environment for private\nsector participation, with access to disaster resilient, affordable, and financially sustainable energy.\n8 However, Pacific DMCs have been slow in adopting renewable energy technologies because of\nboth supply and demand constraints. On the supply side, private investors are not attracted to the\nPacific DMCs as markets in the countries are small and difficult to access, and, in many cases,\nprivate-sector developers are not familiar with the risks faced by the small island developing states\nin the subregion.9 On the demand side, government energy sector policies and regulations are\nlargely not well structured, transparent, nor private sector friendly, as institutions lack the capacity\nto reform regulation and tariffs.10 In most instances, electricity services are provided by state-\nowned, vertically-integrated natural monopolies, with regulatory decisions driven by political\nimperatives on an ad hoc and unpredictable basis. Regulatory and sector governance regimes of\nthis nature, especially in capital-constrained environments that typify the Pacific, do not provide\nfor efficient management of scarce resources, nor deliver satisfactory sector development and\noutcomes. Where countries have stated their desire to attract private investment into the energy\nsector to supplement or supplant scarce public resources, a robust and predictable regulatory\nregime becomes crucially important.\n5. Constrained regulatory capacity. Pacific DMCs have recognized the importance of\nregulation and many of them have established dedicated national regulatory bodies to perform\nregulatory functions. Other DMCs operate the regulatory framework through smaller units spread\nthroughout  several  agencies  or  ministries,  resulting  in  less  efficient  and  effective  reforms.\nHowever, the capacity of all national regulatory authorities has been slow to develop, in part\nattributable to the small scale of each country\u2019s sector and low level of investment in capacity\nbuilding, as well as limited and disparate understanding of modern regulatory concepts among\npolicymakers  and  regulatory  professionals.  These  constraints  to  development  of  regulatory\ncapacity have been recognized by some regulatory practitioners in the region, and attempts have\nbeen made to address them through professional exchanges and pooling of resources to benefit\nfrom economies of scale.11\n6. Nascent regional regulatory collaboration. Founded in 2016 by the heads of energy\nregulatory bodies of Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), \nOPERA has been mandated to (i) support harmonization of the regulation regimes of OPERA\n6  ADB. 2017.

While a constitution for OPERA was adopted by its founding members, OPERA\nhas not been established as a legal entity in any jurisdiction and exists solely as a network of\nenergy regulators in the Pacific DMCs. Hosted by SPC, OPERA is led by a chairman elected by\nOPERA members and supported by SPC staff. With ADB TA support, OPERA has developed its\nfirst business plan and key priority actions for 2021\u20132023, approved by all members.12 To\nenhance OPERA\u2019s policy dialogue and capacity building for Pacific energy regulators (including\nnon-OPERA members), ADB TA supported (i) the first workshop on power purchase agreements\u2019\ntransparency and disclosure standards, and (ii) the preparation and approval of power purchase\nagreements\u2019 transparency guidelines.13\n7. The  objective  of  the  proposed  TA  is  to  promote  regional  cooperation  in  creating\nprogressive regulation of energy utilities in the Pacific by strengthening and enabling OPERA to\ndeliver capacity-building interventions, lead the generation and exchange of knowledge and skills,\nand leverage Pacific DMCs\u2019 limited resources to address common sector development issues\nand challenges. The TA will support OPERA\u2019s network, by strengthening its administrative and\ngovernance  structures,  sustainability,  and  mechanisms  for  fund  raising  and  management,\nincluding attracting support from other development partners and OPERA members.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Impact and Outcome\n8. The TA is aligned with the following impacts: sustainable, low-carbon and climate-resilient\nPacific created; and national and regional policy and regulatory frameworks and business-\nenabling environment improved.14 The TA will have the following outcome: regional collaboration\nand regulation framework for development of Pacific energy sector strengthened.15\nB. Outputs, Methods, and Activities\n9. Output 1: Sustainability of OPERA strengthened. The TA will support the development\nof OPERA\u2019s governance framework and improvement of its policies and procedures to empower\nOPERA as a regional regulation advisory entity in the Pacific subregion. The TA will strengthen\nOPERA\u2019s governance and functional structures, and annual work planning, budgeting, and\nfunding procedures and processes. This will help OPERA to undertake regional regulatory\ncapacity  building  and  cooperation.  The  TA  will  also  support  the  preparation  of  OPERA\u2019s\ncommunication strategy and action plan to enhance its regional profile and knowledge sharing\npractices.  The  TA  will  assist  OPERA  in  creating  a  sustainable  knowledge-sharing  and\nmanagement partnership with a similar regional or global regulation association.\n10. Output 2: Regional capacity building, knowledge sharing, and policy dialogue\norganized. The TA output will create a virtual experts\u2019 hub to respond to requests from Pacific\nDMCs for regulation reform advice in support of investment programs, including those with private\n12 ADB. 2019.

Advisory outputs will include regulation and tariff studies and gender-inclusive \npolicy recommendations that enable decarbonization and leapfrogging of traditional models \nthrough, for example, PPPs. ADB will review all government requests under this output and \nprovide support linked to ongoing or ensuing investments and programs while ensuring strong \ncoordination and harmonized approaches with key development partners\u2019 ongoing and planned \nassistance. The TA will help OPERA create a regional information clearinghouse with a complete \nset of gender-inclusive regulation templates and tariff models for the use of Pacific regulation \nauthorities. This output will be delivered through regional capacity building, knowledge sharing, \nand training activities that will be conducted with at least 30% participation by women. It will help \nincrease awareness of international experience and expertise to better inform Pacific regulation \nauthorities and increase links among key energy sector actors.  \n11. Output 3: Analytical studies on priority regional development issues in utilities\nregulation  and  tariffs  developed.  Output  3  will  support  necessary  policy  and  regulatory\nimprovements, increased private sector participation, and informed investment decisions by\nundertaking analytical studies on priority development issues in regulation and tariffs. A Pacific \nregulation and tariff benchmark study will be prepared together with at least three regional studies \non comparative regulation and tariff reforms. The TA will support dissemination of these regional \nanalytical studies and lesson-sharing among related regulation authorities in Pacific DMCs \u2013 this \nwill further strengthen OPERA\u2019s capacity and institutional role (output 1) and its function in \ncapacity building and training for Pacific regulation authorities (output 2).\nC.  Cost and Financing\n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which (i) $250,000 will be financed on a grant\nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other  sources);  and (ii) $350,000 \nwill be  financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.  16 \nThe  key  expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The Secretariat of the Pacific Community \n(SPC) will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, offic e, office supplies, \nand other in-kind contributions.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n13. ADB is the executing agency and will administer the TA through the Pacific Department\u2019s\nEnergy Division (PAEN). PAEN will engage, select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; organize\nworkshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons in the workshop in close coordination\nwith SPC that performs administration support to OPERA. PAEN will coordinate closely with the\nEnergy  Sector  Group  Secretariat  in  the  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change\nDepartment for Output 2 and Output 3.\n14. Consulting services. ADB will engage individual consultants (international, national and\nregional), including resource persons, following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended\nfrom time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.\nEngagement of individual consultants (i) allows for the mobilization of experts with policy reform\nand regulation expertise and (ii) provides greater flexibility in project implementation, which\nmitigates the risks and constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The consultants will work\nclosely with SPC and OPERA.\n16 Established by ADB. Financing partner: Government of Japan. ", "5 \n15.
