INTRODUCTION \n1.  Dialogue  between  the  Government  of  India  (the  Government)  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has highlighted the need for enhancing the project implementation \ncapacity of agencies implementing ADB-financed projects. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission met \nwith  the  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  (DEA)  in  October  2008  to  prepare  the  technical \nassistance (TA) and reached an understanding with the Government on its impact, outcome, \nscope, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference.1 The concept paper of the TA \nwas approved by the vice-president of ADB on 22 October 2008. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB provides support to India in transport sector development as a core infrastructure \noperation for inclusive economic growth. Since 2003 the focus of ADB\u2019s interventions has \nincreasingly  shifted  toward  relatively  poorer  states  with  weak  capacity,  supporting  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to narrow interstate disparities. Smaller and comparatively weaker states \nhave very limited financial and technical capacity to prepare and implement projects. As a \ndevelopment finance institution committed to poverty reduction, ADB is committed to working in \nstates where capacity is weak.  \n \n3.  Many  ongoing  ADB-financed  transport  projects  in  India  experience  delays  that  are \nmostly  attributable  to  (i)  the  lack  of  safeguard  considerations  in  selecting  and  preparing \ninvestment, as well as insufficient support for safeguard planning and implementation, and (ii) \nthe gap between the feasibility phase and the construction phase in support for executing \nagencies, which are often unfamiliar with ADB procedures for procuring civil works contracts \nand recruiting consultants. \n \n4.  Typically in ADB-financed transport projects, the executing agency implementing ADB-\nfinanced projects (project executing agency or PEA) is a government public works or road \nconstruction  agency.  The  PEA  establishes  in  its  headquarters  a  project  management  unit \nresponsible for initial procurement and safeguard activities and supervising progress. The PEA \nalso  establishes  project  implementation  units,  each  headed  by  a  project  manager,  who  is \nresponsible for implementation in the field. The project managers are delegated adequate \ntechnical and administrative authority for expeditious project implementation. \n \n5.  To support capacity development for preparing projects in a timely and cost-effective \nmanner, the $15 million TA Cluster for Project Processing and Capacity Development has been \nsuccessfully implemented.2 The need remains for further capacity enhancement to improve \nproject readiness, focusing on project implementation capacity. Capacity assessment during \nproject preparation in past ADB-financed transport projects and quarterly tripartite portfolio \nreview meetings (TPRMs) reveal that PEAs require capacity enhancement in procurement, \nenvironment, social development, resettlement, economics, and monitoring results. \n \n6.  The Government and ADB have made various efforts to enhance project readiness so \nthat approved projects can be implemented without unnecessary delay. The Government and \nADB  have  held  TPRMs  where  progress  in  achieving  project  results  is  reviewed  by  the \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 October 2008. \n2  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance Cluster to India for Project Processing and Capacity Development. Manila. \n ", "2   \nmanagement and project implementation staff of ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission and South Asia \nDepartment, senior DEA officials, and state nodal officers and project directors or other senior \nrepresentatives. TPRMs have greatly strengthened project implementation and facilitated cross-\nlearning among projects, sectors, and states. The focus of TPRMs is now to track progress in \nsector and country outcomes, which is beyond the mere monitoring of contract awards and \ndisbursements. While national and sector data are drawn from central and state government \nsources, ADB project-specific output and outcome indicators have to be tracked jointly by ADB \nand PEAs. For this purpose, it is indispensable to enhance capacity in preparing the design and \nmonitoring framework, collecting reliable baseline data, and strengthen monitoring systems. \n \n7.  Another recent Government initiative is to institute a project-readiness checklist. This \nrequires PEAs that apply for ADB loans to undertake preconstruction activities while the loan is \nbeing processed. The checklist includes proper staffing of the project management unit, bid \ndocument  preparation  and  evaluation,  land  acquisition,  environmental  clearance,  and  the \nprovision  of  adequate  budgeting  required  for  project  implementation.  Recent  state  roads \nprojects in India have addressed these issues and substantially reduced implementation delays. \nThis experience suggests that it is necessary for ADB to work closely with government agencies \nto ensure project readiness by providing more continuous support and advice on aspects of \nproject  implementation.  More  continuous  support  and  advice  are  required  to  sustainably \nenhance project readiness and monitoring results. \n \n8.  As ADB has a significant pipeline of investment projects in the transport sector in India, \nand as efficient implementation with minimal delay is required, ADB\u2019s support for developing the \ncapacity  of  PEAs  toward  enhancing  project  readiness  is  necessary.  The  TA  will  help \ngovernment agencies to acquire and adapt international best practices in procurement and \nsafeguard activities for projects financed by other sources as well and, at the same time, ensure \ntimely and expert project implementation. Results orientation and knowledge solutions are core \nfocuses of ADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy for India (2008\u20132012). 3 \n \n9.  The  country  assistance  program  evaluation  observes  that  external  development \nagencies  such  as  ADB  make  themselves  useful  to  the  government\u2019s  development  efforts \nbeyond the volume of their financial assistance by bringing in international best practices and \nsharing development experience, developing capacity, and instilling discipline in project design \nand  implementation  through  transparent  and  standardized  procurement  procedures  and \ndocumentation. The TA will significantly improve the quality of projects at entry and improve the \ndevelopment outcomes of ADB\u2019s transport projects in India. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  improved  implementation  readiness  in  transport \ninfrastructure projects in India. Delays and the consequential cost overruns will be minimized. \nThe TA will strengthen efficiency and ownership in project implementation from an early stage of \nproject  preparation.  While  government  agencies  have  certain  capacity  to  prepare  and \nimplement  projects,  there  is  room  for  enhancing  it  in  regard  to  timeliness  and  quality  of \nprocurement and safeguard activities, and adopting international best practices. Enhancing \ncapacity  in  evaluating  project  economics  and  in  monitoring  development  impacts  will  help \nimprove the quality for future projects by taking lessons into account.  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. Forthcoming. Country Partnership Strategy (2008-2012): India. Manila. \n ", "  3\n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The fundamental methodology of the TA is to facilitate project execution with greater \nresults orientation by enhancing the knowledge and skills of PEAs and sharing project-specific \nexperience among PEAs. This will enable each PEA to adopt best practices more effectively. \nThe TA will provide a platform for sharing best practices among PEAs. The TA is expected to \ntarget ADB-financed projects, but other projects could be considered.  \n \n12.  The TA will involve the following activities in procurement, safeguard implementation, \neconomics, and monitoring of development indicators.  \n \n(i)  On-the-job training. The TA consultant will assist PEAs in project implementation \nthrough  on-the-job  training  and  advice  on  (a)  ADB  bidding  documents  and \nprocedures and International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) documents \nand  FIDIC-based  contract  management;  (b)  ADB  policies  on  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples and the implementation of resettlement plans and indigenous \npeoples development plans, including the management of their consultants and/or \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  (c)  ADB  policies  on  gender  and  social \nprotection and the implementation of relevant measures for mitigating social impacts, \nincluding the management of their consultants and/or NGOs; (d) ADB policies on the \nenvironment and the implementation of environmental management plans; and (e) \nADB guidelines for project economics and design and for monitoring frameworks. \n \n(ii)  Surveys. The consultant will undertake the required surveys in coordination with \nPEAs, especially those requiring improved techniques and skills. They may include \nbaseline  surveys  of  key  indicators  and  of  skills  required  for  monitoring  and \nsupervising  safeguard  activities  such  as  census  verification  and  updating.  The \nconsultant may prepare a brief manual of such surveys so that PEAs will be able to \nundertake  surveys  for  future  projects.  Initially,  the  simplest  and  most  suitable \nmethods will be recommended to PEAs for their undertaking of such surveys using \noptimal resources. \n \n(iii)  Workshops and training. To sustain capacity development, workshops and training \nwill be provided. Country-wide workshops can facilitate information and experience \nexchange  among  various  government  officials,  enhancing  project  quality  and \nreadiness. International best practices and their effective application in local contexts \ncan be shared and further developed. \n \n(iv)  Site visits. PEA officials will visit other project offices to exchange experiences and \nlearn and develop best international practices adapted to local conditions. Project-\nspecific issues and solutions can be shared to mitigate avoidable problems in project \nimplementation.  The  consultant  will  facilitate  these  activities  and  consolidate \npractices to be shared among PEAs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,875,000 equivalent, of which $1,500,000 equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe Government will contribute $375,000 equivalent in kind by providing office accommodation, \n ", "4   \nsupport  facilities,  counterpart  staff,  maps,  reports,  and  other  logistical  support.  The  cost \nestimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  DEA will be the Executing Agency of the TA. Candidate PEAs will be those applying for \nand obtaining ADB loans such as state road agencies. These PEAs will ask DEA and ADB for \ncapacity development from the TA, and those that receive capacity development will provide the \nin-kind support. Tripartite meetings will be held regularly among PEAs, DEA, and ADB to \ndiscuss outstanding issues and actions to be taken to address them. All equipment for the TA \nwill be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and turned over to the Government upon TA completion. Disbursements under the TA will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.4 \n \n15.  Consultants\u2019 activities will be closely monitored to ensure that PEAs are the primary \nauthors  of  bidding,  social,  environmental,  and  resettlement  documents,  thus  making  the \ncapacity development more sustainable. Consulting services can be provided only after the \nproject management unit is established and, for procurement tasks, the procurement committee \nis been established and, for safeguard-related tasks, the safeguard nodal officers appointed. \nThis condition will help expedite the appointment of these officials. \n \n16.  It is expected that about 10 PEAs will enjoy capacity development under this TA. The \nconsultants will visit each PEA regularly and maintain day-to-day communication to provide \nguidance as needed.   \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from March 2009 to February 2010, and \nwill require 10 person-months of international consulting services and 88 person-months of \nnational  consulting  services.  Individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  procurement  (1 \ninternational  expert  for  5  person-months  and  2  national  experts  for  22  person-months), \nresettlement (2 national experts for 22 person-months), social development (2 national experts \nfor 22 person-months), environment (2 national experts for 22 person-months), and transport \neconomics (1 international expert for 5 person-months). ADB will recruit the consultants in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  Each  consultant  will  submit  (i)  an  inception  report  within  1  month  of  engagement, \nelaborating the initial work program after consultation with DEA, PEAs and ADB; (ii) monthly \nprogress reports and working papers as required in each project assigned, providing a summary \nof  activities,  an  assessment  of  capacity-related  issues,  and  recommendations  to  enhance \ncapacity; (iii) the draft final report 1 month before TA completion, summarizing all activities \nundertaken, assessing in detail capacity enhancement, and recommending how capacity can be \nfurther enhanced. \n \n19.  Three nationwide workshops and trainings will be conducted during TA implementation \nin procurement, safeguard matters, and economic and development impacts of projects. The \nworkshops will facilitate the exchange of information among government officials. The second \nworkshop, occurring about 9 months after TA commencement, will discuss actions required for \nthe remaining period of TA implementation and future requirements after the TA.  \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008.
