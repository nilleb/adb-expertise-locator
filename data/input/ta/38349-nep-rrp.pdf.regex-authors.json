TIA's airfield side infrastructure will be reconfigured and \nupgraded to international safety standards, including provision or \nconstruction of (i) about 1,400 meters (m) of new main taxiways \nand link taxiways, (ii) runway end safety area and extension, (iii) \nrunway  approach  lights,  (iv)  an  instrument  landing  system \nlocalizer, (v) an uninterrupted power supply system for essential \nairfield  and  security  area  lights,  (vi)  air  traffic  communication \nequipment,(vii)  additional  international  and  domestic  aircraft \nparking apron area, and (viii) upgrading of rescue and fire fighting \nsystem. TIA's terminal infrastructure will be rehabilitated with the \nexisting international terminal refurnished and upgraded, and a \nnew temporary domestic terminal of about 10,000 square meters \n(m2) constructed. Basic safety improvements at the three remote \ndomestic airports include a visual approach guidance system and \nabbreviated precision approach path indicator at Lukla airport, and \nrunway  threshold  identifiers  and  runway  end  lights,  air  traffic \ncontrol equipment, and meteorological equipment at Simikot and \nRara airports. \n \nThe  Project  will  also  improve  overall  sector  management  by \nimplementing a 3-year capacity development program for the Civil \nAviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN). CAAN's organizational and \nmanagement  capacity  will  be  strengthened  by  updating  the \nexisting regulations, developing a strategy to adapt the regulatory \nframework  based  on  international  standards,  improving  human \nresources development, upgrading the financial and management \ninformation  system,  implementing  a  systematic  maintenance ", "ii \n \nprogram,  and  identifying  viable  opportunities  for  private  sector \nparticipation  for  future  airport  infrastructure  development  and \nmaintenance. \n   \nRationale  Due  to  the  challenging  terrain  in  Nepal,  air  transport  is  an \nimportant part of the country\u2019s overall transport system, providing \naccess to many remote towns and villages in the mountainous \nareas.  Nepal's  natural  landscape  and  cultural  heritage  offer \ntourism development potential. A safe and reliable air transport \nsystem  is  vital  to  achieving  the  Government's  tourism \ndevelopment  targets,  and  therefore  receiving  the  economic \nbenefits. TIA is the country's only international airport and safety \nconcerns urgently need to be addressed. TIA's airside facilities, \nrunways,  taxiways,  apron,  and  communication  navigation \nsurveillance equipment are not fully compliant with international \nsafety standards and recommended practices. The Project will \nprovide improvements to address the current safety issues and \ncapacity constraints.  \n \nThe domestic airports in Lukla, Rara, and Simikot serve remote \nareas that are otherwise inaccessible by road, and air transport is \nan  essential  mode  of  communications  for  both  the  local \ncommunities  and  tourists.  These  airports  will  support  tourism \ndevelopment and need urgent rehabilitation and upgrading. The \nProject  will  upgrade  and  improve  communication  equipment, \nvisual approach aids, and weather equipment.  \n \nCAAN  is  responsible  for  the  administration  of  civil  aviation  in \nNepal  and  is  essentially  functioning  well.  However,  further \ninstitutional enhancement, especially in its operational efficiency \nand management capacity, is necessary to effectively handle the \nexpected demand of greater air transport traffic in the medium \nterm. Overall, the Project is to address major factors hindering the \nfuture growth of the air transport subsector by improving safety to \ninternational  standards,  easing  capacity  constraints,  and \nenhancing CAAN's organizational effectiveness.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  will  be  improved  transport  connectivity,  promoting \nbroad-based economic growth. The Project's immediate outcome \nwill  be  improved  safety  and  capacity  at  TIA  and  at  remote \ndomestic  airports  in  Lukla,  Rara  and  Simikot,  and  improved \ninstitutional capacity of CAAN. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the project is estimated at $92.0 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of about $11.5 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The proposed financing consists of (i) a grant not exceeding $10 \nmillion; and (ii) a loan in various currencies equivalent to Special \nDrawings  Rights  44,388,000,  $70  million  equivalent,  from  the \nSpecial Funds resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nThe loan will have a term of 32 years, including an 8-year grace \n ", "iii \n \nperiod, an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per year thereafter, and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  financing  and  project \nagreements. ADB will finance 87% of the total project investment \ncost, and the Government will finance 13% of the total project \ninvestment  cost.  The  Government's  financing  includes  taxes, \nduties,  and  in-kind  contributions  for  project  management  and \noffice operations. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal  \n   \nImplementation  CAAN  is  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  Project  and  has \nArrangements  established  a  project  coordination  unit  (PCU),  led  by  CAAN's \ndeputy  director  general  of  the  Air  Transport  Planning  and \nDevelopment Directorate. The PCU will be responsible for overall \nproject  management,  including  (i)  consultant  selection,  (ii) \nprocurement, (iii) withdrawal applications, (iv) environmental and \nsocial monitoring, and (v) maintenance of project accounts and \ncompletion of loan financial records for auditing purposes. Under \nthe  project  coordination  unit,  two  project  implementation  units \n(PIUs)  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  monitoring  and \nexecution of the infrastructure and capacity development project \ncomponents. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the Project will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive  bidding \n(ICB) will be used for procurement of works estimated to cost \nmore than $1.0 million and for goods estimated to cost more than \n$500,000. Shopping will be used for works and goods estimated \nto cost less than $100,000. National competitive bidding will be \nused for works and goods estimated to cost less than those stated \nfor ICB, in accordance with Nepal's national competitive bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Indicative contract packages, to \nbe  procured  using  ICB,  include  two  works  packages  and  one \ngoods package ranging in cost from $5 million to $39 million.  \n   \nConsulting Services  All consultants under the Project will be recruited in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). For project management advisory \nservices, one international and one national individual consultant \nwill be recruited, using individual selection procedure. For detail \ndesign and supervision, a firm of international consultants will be \nrecruited using quality- and cost-based selection procedures, with \nfull technical proposal and a 90:10 proportion of quality to cost. \n ", "iv \n \nThe services will be implemented over about 48 calendar months \nand will require about 116 international person-months and 531 \nnational  person-months  of  services.  For  the  development  and \nimplementation of the capacity development program, a firm of \ninternational consultants will be recruited using quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedures, with full technical proposal and a \n90:10  proportion  of  quality  to  cost.  The  services  will  be \nimplemented  over  about  36  calendar  months  and  will  require \nabout 118 international person-months and 82 national person-\nmonths of services. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will contribute to improving the performance of the air \nBeneficiaries  transport  subsector  by  addressing  major  factors  hindering  its \neffectiveness\u2014improving safety to international standards, easing \ncapacity  constraints,  and  enhancing  institutional  capacity.  The \nProject will align air transport services and facilities in Nepal with \ninternational  safety  standards  and  recommended  practices, \nthereby increasing regional and international air connectivity for \nNepal and promoting regional tourism. The beneficiaries will be \nthe  people,  companies,  and  government  and  nongovernment \nagencies that use the air transport service directly and indirectly. \nInternational and domestic passengers will experience enhanced \nquality of service. TIA is the only international airport in Nepal and \nthe  improved  safety  and  capacity  will  also  help  sustain  and \nsupport  tourism  development  throughout  the  country.  The \ncommunities  living  in  the  areas  served  by  the  three  remote \ndomestic  airports  will  directly  benefit  from  the  improved \naccessibility, including the opportunity to promote tourism. The \nincremental growth in tourism revenue will support small business \nand local employment opportunities.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The risk of delayed implementation will be mitigated by taking \nadvance  action  for  recruitment  of  the  detail  design  and \nsupervision  consultant,  and  engaging  an  international  and  a \nnational  individual  consultant  to  provide  project  management \nsupport. \n \nCAAN generates sufficient revenue to cover routine maintenance \nrequirements.  Its  maintenance  management  and  planning \ncapabilities  will  be  strengthened  under  the  Project's  capacity \ndevelopment component. CAAN will implement the maintenance \nprogram and allocate sufficient budget to meet requirements. \n \nThere  are  general  risks  associated  with  the  internal  security \nsituation  in  certain  parts  of  the  country,  which  can  hinder \nconstruction activities. However, potential risk to the Project is \nminor as the main component of the Project is situated in the \ncapital area of Kathmandu, and the works are within the confined \nand secured area of the respective airports. \n \nThe Procurement risks will be mitigated by adapting (i) ADB's prior \n ", "v \n \nreview  process,  and  (ii)  the  Government's  technical  audits \nconducted under the supervision of the National Vigilance Centre. \nAll  works  and  goods  packages  are  procured  using  ICB \nprocedures. The potential risk is further reduced due to the nature \nof the improvement works and goods being procured, which are \nmainly  superstructure  works  and  specialized  equipment.  This \nfacilitates easier verification of quantity and quality. \n \n ", "82o  00'E 88o  00'E\nNEPAL\nAIR TRANSPORT CAPACITY\n30 o 00'N HUMLA ENHANCEMENT PROJECT 30 o 00'N\nFAR-WESTERN Simikot Airport\nDEVELOPMENT MID-WESTERN\nREGION DEVELOPMENT\nSimikot REGION\nDARCHULA N\nDarchula PEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nMAHAKALI OF  CHINA\nBAJHANG Gamgadhi\nBAITADI Chainpur BAJURA Rara AirpMorUtGU 0 20 40 60 80 100\nPatan SETI Martadi\nDadeldhura KARNALI\nSilgarhi Jumla WESTERN Kilometers\nDADELDHURA Mangalsen KALIKOT JUMLA DOLPA DEVELOPMENT\nDOTI ACHHAM Manma MUSTANG REGION\nDunai\nMahendranagar\nDAILEKH JAJARKOT Jomson\nKANCHANPUR\nMasuliya DBailHekEhRJIajarkot RUKUM DHAWALAGIRI ChMamANeANG DEVCEELNOTPRMALENT\nKol MYAGDI REGION \nKAILALI BGAuRlaDriIyYaA SUBRireKnHdEraTnagarSALYSAaNlyanLRiwAanPgTRIOLPPAYUTHANBAGLUNBaGgluBnKegunPsiAhmRBaAT KPAokShKaIra GLAANMDJBUAeNsKGisIaharGORKHA DhuncheBARGASMUAWTAI DEVEREAELSGOTIEPORMNNENT\nBANKE Tulsipur Pyuthan GULMI Gorkha SINDHUPALCHOK\nNepalganj Sandikharka Tamghas SYANJSAyanjaTANAHU DHADINBGidur NTUriWbAhKuOvTan IntCehranuatatriaonal Airport Lukla Airport\nARGHAKHANCHI PALPA Kathmandu DOLAKHA\nDANG KAPILBASTU BuTtawnaslen LUNMABWIANLIPARASI NarayangarhNaubiseLALITPURKBAHTBHAhKMakTAtAaNpPDuUrUR Charikot SOLUKHUMBU SANKHUWASABHAPhTuAnPgLliEngJUNG\nTaulihawa RUPANDEHI Parasi CHITWNAANRAYHeAtaNuIda PAKLAABNHCRHEOKRaRmAeMcEchCaHpHAPOKOHkhAaLldDhHuUngNaGSaAlleDriiktelBBHhOojJpPuUrRKhTanEdRbHarAiTHUMMEPChidHimI\nPARSA Sindhulimadi KHOTANG Terhanthum\n27 o 00'N National Capital BMAARKAWANPUR JANAKPUSRINDHULI SAGARMATHA Dhankuta PANCHTAR Ilam27 o 00'N\nDistrict Headquarters Birganj Kalaiya SARLAHI UDAYAPUR DHANKUTA ILAM\nPPNrraootjjieeoccntta  IRln Hetemigrnhoawtetai oDynoaml Aesirtpico rAtirport I   N   D   I   A RAUTAHGAauTr MMAaHlaOnTgaTwAaRDIHANJaUnSakHpAurSSirIaRhAaHA SGAPaiTgAhaRtI DShUarNaSnARIKMOOSRHAINGChaJnHdAraPgAadhi\nJaleswar Rajbiraj Rangeli\nFeeder/District Road\nRiver\nDistrict Boundary\nZonal Boundary\nRegional Boundary\nInternational Boundary\n0 Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n9\n-3\n0\n9\n3 H 82o  00'E 88o  00'E\nR", " \nI.

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Transport  connectivity  is  vital  to  Nepal's  priority  development  goals.  Connectivity \nprovides  accessibility,  bringing  excluded  regions  and  social  groups  into  the  economic \nmainstream and promoting broad-based economic growth. Due to the challenging terrain in \nNepal, air transport is an important part of the country\u2019s overall transport system, providing \naccess to many remote towns and villages in the mountainous areas. International travelers, \nmostly arriving and departing by air, sustain the development of tourism, trade, and commerce. \nThe Government's objective is to develop and expand the country's civil aviation system and to \nensure  safe  and  effective  operation  of  flights,  communication,  and  air  navigation  and  air \ntransportation  services.  The  Project1  will  support  the  Government's  objective  by  improving \nsafety  to  comply  with  international  standards,  easing  capacity  constraints,  and  enhancing \ninstitutional capacity. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Details of the \nsector analysis are in Appendix 2. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Air transport in Nepal has a significant role in the administrative, economic, and social \ndevelopment of the country. In the absence of adequate surface transport it has provided \nessential  links  between  Kathmandu  (the  capital  city)  and  the  various  administrative  and \ncommercial centers of the country, as well as with the outside world. For many mountainous \nand remote rural districts of the country, air transport provides the only means of mechanized \ntransport.  It  also  provides  vital  support  to  the  development  of  tourism  as  well  as  trade, \nmanufacturing, and commerce. \n \n4.  Nepal  has  47  airports,  comprising  one  international  airport\u2014Tribhuvan  International \nAirport  (TIA)  in  Kathmandu\u2014four  regional  airports,  and  42  other  domestic  airport  facilities \ncomprising airports, and short-take off and landing strips. Of the 42 domestic airports, only 27 \nare operational. International air services are provided at TIA by the national airline, Nepal \nAirlines Corporation, and 20 other international airlines, which serve 21 foreign destinations in \n14 countries. Domestic commercial air services are provided by seven domestic air carriers, \noffering both fixed and rotary wing scheduled and charter services. Twenty one main domestic \ndestinations are served by regular scheduled domestic services, including the four regional \nairports of Bhairawa, Biratnagar, Nepalgung and Pokhara. The principal domestic airlines are \nYeti Airlines and Buddha Air. \n \n5.  The  volume  of  air  traffic,  expressed  in  terms  of  air  passengers,  has  increased \nconsiderably over the past 20 years, with annual growth rates varying from 7% to more than \n17% per annum. In 2007 and 2008, strong growth in excess of 12% per year was recorded for \npassenger traffic and 7% in aircraft movements. For TIA, international and domestic passenger \ntraffic is forecast to increase from 2.8 million in 2008 to 4.6 million passengers annually by 2013 \nand to 9.3 million passengers by 2028. \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2007. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Preparing the Civil Aviation Airport \nProject. Manila (approved on 14 December). ", "2 \n \n \n6.  The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), an autonomous organization established in \n1998, is responsible for the administration of civil aviation in Nepal. CAAN fulfills its functions of \nregulating civil aviation and operating the national airports and air traffic and air navigation \nsystems. CAAN's performance in regulating civil aviation has ensured that a good safety record \nhas  been  achieved  for  air  transport  operations  in  Nepal\u2019s  uniquely  hazardous  aviation \nenvironment, while the operation of the airport and air navigation system has generated a profit \nfor CAAN since 2004. CAAN\u2019s performance has been hampered by a shortage of qualified and \ntrained staff in both the regulatory and operational functions, which has placed the organization \nunder pressure. A lack of management systems, such as computerization and information \nmanagement, has also limited the capability and efficiency with which the organization operates. \n \n7.  CAAN\u2019s financial performance has improved considerably since its establishment in \n1998. The early years of operation resulted in operating losses. However, this was turned \naround by FY2004, when a positive net operating profit was first recorded. From FY2004 \nonwards, CAAN has been in a profitable position in every year to FY2008, the latest year for \nwhich  data  is  currently  available.  In  FY2008,  CAAN\u2019s  revenues  were  NRs1.93  billion \n(approximately $25 million). These were generated from airport aeronautical charges (72% of \nrevenues derived from the passenger service charge, aircraft landing fees, aircraft parking and \nhangar  charges,  and  aviation  fuel  surcharge),  non-aeronautical  charges  generated  from \ncommercial activities (21%), air traffic services charges (6%), and regulation (1%). Operating \nexpenses in the same year were NRs550 million ($7.1 million), comprising payroll costs and \nbenefits (53%), direct operating expenses (31%), and administrative and general expenses \n(16%). CAAN\u2019s overall expenditure on maintenance is an estimated NRs44.7 million, or 25% of \ndirect operating costs, which is lower than would normally be expected, suggesting a lower than \ndesirable level of maintenance effort. \n \n8.  The profitability of CAAN is mainly attributable to the operation of TIA, which generates \nalmost 91% of CAAN\u2019s total revenue. The four regional airports account for only 5% of total \nrevenues, but taken together return a profit to CAAN of just over NRs31.5 million. Only three of \nthe four regional airports are profitable. Of the other 27 operating domestic airports, only four of \nthese are profitable on operations. However, many of these domestic airports serve remote \nareas and are operated largely for social and administrative reasons. In aggregate, operation of \nthe 27 domestic airports comes close to breaking even, returning only a very small loss. It is \nclear  that  the  financial  performance  of  CAAN  is  very  much  determined  by  the  financial \nperformance of TIA and its ability to accommodate increasing air traffic and passenger levels. In \nturn, this is partly dependent upon TIA's ability to continue operating satisfactorily, retain and \nincrease traffic, and maintain its equipment and facilities. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Main Sector Issues and Government Initiatives \n9.  As air traffic is forecasted to double by 2019, Nepal's air transport system needs to \nimprove safety and capacity, and enhance institutional effectiveness in terms of regulatory \nfunction, airport operation, and air navigation and air traffic services. Under the Government's \nThree Year Interim Plan (FY2008\u2013FY2010), upgrading TIA and other domestic airports, and \nstrengthening  institutional  capabilities,  are  among  the  main  strategies  for  the  civil  aviation \nsector. \n \n ", "3 \n \na.  Safety  at  Tribhuvan  International  Airport  and  Other  Domestic \nAirports \n \n10.  Safety concerns at TIA urgently need to be addressed. Its airside facilities, runways, \ntaxiways, and apron are not fully compliant with the International Civil Aviation Organization\u2019s \n(ICAO's) safety and security standards and recommended practices. A large portion of the \nessential communication navigation surveillance (CNS) equipment is outdated, and suffers from \ntechnical  problems  and  a  scarcity  of  spare  parts.  To  minimize  risks,  flights,  especially \ninternational ones, are concentrated in the day time, leading to inefficiency in airport operations. \nThe use of the existing international terminal area is not optimized for passenger processing. \nThe quality of passenger services in both the international and domestic terminals is poor and \ninadequate. \n \n11.  While TIA is the main focus of improvement needs, the Government has identified three \ndomestic airports\u2014Lukla, Rara, and Simikot\u2014which serve remote areas that are otherwise \ninaccessible by road and where air transport is essential for both the local communities and \ntourists. These airports will support tourism development and need urgent rehabilitation and \nupgrading.  Upgrading  communication  equipment,  improving  visual  approach  guidance  and \nweather equipment, and surfacing the runways are among the required improvements. \n \nb.  Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Capacity Building \n12.  Human  Resources  Development.  One  of  CAAN's  main  capacity  constraints  is  a \nshortage  of  qualified  and  trained  staff.  The  current  staff  complement  is  774,  against  an \nauthorized staffing level of 1,065. Consequently, CAAN is understaffed by 27% and is short of \nstaff in areas that are critical to its functions as a regulator of civil aviation and as the operator of \nthe airports and air traffic and air navigation system. In terms of capacity building for human \nresources development, there is a need to address both the salary levels and the position and \nstaff grading system, and to revise the personnel rules to support the development of the \norganization,  not  hinder  it.  At  the  same  time,  assistance  to  CAAN  is  needed  to  establish \nappropriate  budgets  for  CAAN  departments,  through  developing  a  business  plan  for  the \norganization, and to assist CAAN in recruiting staff. There is a need to develop a training \nprogram for the entire organization for implementation by international and domestic training \nexperts to provide specific training to CAAN staff. \n \n13.  Financial  Management  and  Information  Systems.  CAAN  operates  within  an \nenvironment where computerization has not been applied, except in a very few offices. In this \nenvironment, information cannot generally be shared among staff, or stored electronically. The \norganization therefore relies upon manual systems, and the storage of information is principally \nin hard-copy form. As a result, it is difficult and time consuming for staff to obtain information, \nretrieve information and documents, and to carry out appropriate analysis. The manual nature of \nthe present information management system is also prone to inefficiency in performing job \nfunctions,  and  potential  loss  of  critical  documents  and  information.  Similarly,  financial \ninformation collected from the regional and domestic airports is collected in manual form, and \nmanually entered in spreadsheets when received at headquarters. A proprietary accounting \nsystem is needed within CAAN, as is a better system of collecting financial information from the \nairports  and  ensuring  its  accurate  representation  in  the  accounts  held  at  headquarters.  A \ncomputerized management information system is needed to transform the present manual \ninformation  management  approach  into  a  system  in  which  information  entry,  storage,  and \nretrieval  of  all  information  necessary  to  support  CAAN\u2019s  operations  can  be  carried  out \nelectronically on a networked computer system. This will enable greater management efficiency, \n ", "4 \n \neasier  and  quicker  access  to  information,  and  the  ability  to  carry  out  analysis  of  CAAN\u2019s \noperations and performance. The details of the financial management assessment are provided \nin Appendix 9. \n \n14.  Private Sector Participation. Outside the operations of the airline services, the private \nsector plays only a limited role in the operation of air transport infrastructure in Nepal, such as \nretailing in the passenger terminals. To enhance the quality and efficiency of services, there is a \nneed  to  assess  the  opportunities  for  a  greater  private  sector  role  in  the  operation  and \ndevelopment of air transport infrastructure, such as construction and operation of the entire \nairport, or portions such as passenger and cargo terminals, ground handling services, and air \ntraffic services. CAAN has not developed its own framework for becoming involved with the \nprivate sector in build-operate-transfer projects, nor have the implications for CAAN and its \nrevenues been studied. CAAN is interested in developing a new international terminal at TIA \neither entirely, or though cofinancing, with the private sector. However, the financial feasibility of \nthis project is unknown, and it is therefore unclear whether the project could attract a private \nsector developer. To assess the possibility, the proposed Project will include a due diligence \nstudy needed to explore the feasibility of developing the proposed new international terminal \nbuilding  to  establish  whether  this  project  is  financially  feasible,  and  under  what  terms  of \nrecovery, and to identify the implications for CAAN\u2019s revenues that might arise from private \nsector participation in this development project. \n \n15.  Institutional Enhancement. CAAN is responsible for both the regulatory functions and \noperation of airports and air navigation services. Considering the current size of operations and \ntraffic levels, separating the regulatory and service function is not critical or required at this \nstage. Some countries with much higher traffic levels do operate with arrangements similar to  \nCAAN.  An  assessment  indicates  that  the  current  traffic  levels  are  not  sufficient  to  ensure \nfinancial viability of the separated entity. However, the Government recognizes the need to start \npreparatory steps. To assist, the Project will prepare the legal framework and transition and \nimplementation plans, analyze the projected traffic and revenue growth and financial viability of \nseparated entities, and propose an implementation schedule. \n \n2.  External Assistance \n16.  The civil aviation subsector receives a substantial portion of external assistance through \nbilateral sources such as Australia, France, and Japan. This assistance is usually targeted for \nspecific safety improvement equipment such as radar, air traffic communication equipment, \ninstitutional  advisory  services,  and  formal  training  in  air  traffic  management.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has been the main funding agency in the subsector since 1969, \nfocusing on infrastructure improvement with respect to safety and capacity. The combined \nexternal assistance has played a key role in maintaining and improving the safety standards at \nTIA and various other domestic airports. In the long term, however, it can be reasonably \nexpected that the heavy reliance on external assistance, especially bilateral sources, could be \nreduced as CAAN is showing signs of financial viability due to sustained traffic growth. The list \nof external assistance to the civil aviation sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  Donor coordination was carried out through participation in the stakeholder consultation \nworkshops. A consultation was held with the Japan International Cooperation Agency who is \ncurrently  funding  installation  of  radar  equipment  at  various  locations  in  the  country.  The \nproposed project scope was discussed to ensure coordination where appropriate and to avoid \nany potential scope duplication. \n \n ", "5 \n \n3.  Lessons Learned \n18.  ADB's operations in the subsector have generally been successful, although the projects \nhave  often  been  delayed  by  various  issues  such  as  weak  institutional  capacity,  lengthy \ngovernment approval procedures, underestimated cost, and overoptimistic schedule. Lessons \nlearned have been incorporated into this Project.  \n \n19.  CAAN's institutional capacity, although weak at the time of its inception in 1998, has \nimproved  steadily.  The  Project  will  integrate  a  major  capacity  strengthening  component  to \nfurther  enhance  CAAN's  effectiveness  in  terms  of  operational  efficiency  and  management \ncapacity. CAAN, as an autonomous organization, will execute the Project with streamlined \ninternal approval procedures. The Government has also increased the ceiling amounts for \ncontract variations requiring cabinet approval. The cost estimate will reflect current prices with \nadequate price contingencies for potential exchange fluctuation. The implementation schedule \nwill be based on realistic assessment of local conditions and contractor capacity. \n \n4.  ADB's Air Transport Subsector Strategy \n20.  ADB's past involvement in the subsector focused mainly on the phased development of \nTIA, which included lengthening of main runways and taxiways, construction of an international \nterminal building, and expansion of the domestic terminal building. These improvements helped \nto alleviate congestion, sustain traffic growth, and promote tourism, playing a significant role in \nsupporting the country's economic and social development. \n \n21.  ADB's  overall  strategy  in  the  subsector  is  to  improve  domestic  and  international \nconnectivity  in  order  to  support  the  country's  development  goal  of  promoting  broad-based \neconomic growth. \n \n22.  The Project is in line with continuing ADB assistance with strategic objectives as set out \nin the country strategy and program2: (i) continue assistance in the improvement of TIA and \nstrategic domestic airports, (ii) continue to support the restructuring and reform of CAAN, and \n(iii)  assist  the  Government  with  improving  the  regulatory  framework  for  private  sector \nparticipation in the subsector.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The impact, in support of the country strategy and program, will be improved transport \nconnectivity promoting broad-based economic growth. The Project's immediate outcome will be \nimproved  safety  and  capacity  at  TIA  in  Kathmandu;  enhanced  safety  at  remote  domestic \nairports in Lukla, Rara, and Simikot; and improved institutional capacity of CAAN. \n \nB.  Outputs \n24.  The Project outputs are as follows: \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004.Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009): Nepal.Manila. \n ", "6 \n \n(i)  for TIA: airside infrastructure reconfigured to meet international safety standards, \nlandside infrastructure rehabilitated and improved for larger capacity, and the \nCNS/air traffic management equipment upgraded; \n \n(ii)  for  remote  domestic  airports  at  Lukla,  Rara,  and  Simikot:  basic  safety \ninfrastructure improved; and \n \n(iii)  for CAAN: organizational and management capabilities enhanced. \n \n25.  Investment  Component:  Tribhuvan  International  Airport  and  Three  Remote \nDomestic Airports. TIA's airside will be reconfigured and upgraded with (i) construction of \napproximately 700 meters (m) of new taxiways and 700 m of link taxiways; (ii) construction of \nrunway end safety area and 300 m extension for runway 02; (iii) installation of category 1 \napproach lights for runway 20 and simple approach lighting for runway 02; (iv) installation of an \ninstrument landing system/localizer; (v) installation of a generator and secondary power supply \nfor essential airfield and security area lights; (vi) installation of new air traffic communication \nequipment; (vii) relocation of Nepal army and domestic airlines hangars to eastern side of \nrunway in accordance with airport master plan; and (viii) construction of approximately 80,000 \nsquare meters (m2) of new international and domestic apron. TIA's landside infrastructure will be \nrehabilitated  and  improved  with  the  refurbishing  and  upgrade  of  the  existing  international \nterminal, and construction of a new temporary domestic terminal of 10,000 m2. Basic safety \nfeatures will be improved at the three remote domestic airports, including a visual guidance \nsystem at Lukla airport; runway lights, visual aids, and meteorological equipment at Simikot and \nRara airports; and runway pavement at Rara airport. \n \n26.  Capacity  Development  Component.  The  Project  will  implement  a  3-year  capacity \ndevelopment program enhancing CAAN's organizational and management capabilities. This \nincludes  (i)  completing  the  ongoing  preparation  of  the  civil  aviation  regulations  based  on \ninternational standards; (ii) preparing a strategy for separating regulatory and service functions \nwith  a  legal  framework  and  implementation  plan;  (iii)  developing  a  national  air  transport \ndevelopment  plan  and  corporate  business  plan;  (iv)  devising  and  implementing  a  human \nresources development plan with a staff training policy and program; (v) improving the financial \nmanagement system, including installation of accounting software and training to integrate \nphysical and financial planning and management systems; (vi) implementing a computerized \nmanagement information system with training; and (vii) conducting due diligence studies for \nprivate sector participation in the development and operation of airport infrastructure. Prior to \nimplementation, assessments made during project preparation will be reviewed and needs and \nrequirements will be confirmed and adjusted as appropriate. \n \nC.  Special Features \n27.  The Project will help align Nepal's air transport services and facilities with established \ninternational  safety  standards  and  recommended  practices.  This  will  improve  regional  and \ninternational connectivity, and promote regional tourism. The Project will assess the role and \npotential of public\u2013private partnerships in the development, operation, and maintenance of \nNepal's air transport infrastructure. It will help identify possible options and a way forward. The \nProject will help the Government prepare to implement timely reforms in terms of separating its \nregulatory function from service provisions. \n \n ", "7 \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n28.  The project investment cost is estimated at $92.00 million, including taxes and duties of \n$11.45 million.

To help finance the Project, the Government has requested a grant3 of $10 million and a \nloan of SDR 44,388,000 ($70 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan \nwill have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \n30.  ADB will finance 87% of the total project investment cost and the Government will \nfinance 13% of the total project investment cost. The Government's financing consists of taxes \nand  duties,  and  in-kind  contributions  for  project  office  accommodation,  renovations, \nmaintenance, utilities, and other miscellaneous project management costs. A detailed cost \nestimate and financing plan is provided in Appendix 5, including the magnitudes of physical \ncontingencies as a percentage of the base costs and of the inflation factors used in estimating \nprice contingencies. \n                                                 \n3  A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its \nrisk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Nepal had a moderate risk of debt \ndistress and was therefore eligible to receive 50% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants. \n ", "8 \n \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)  Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank, ADF Loan  70.00  76 \nAsian Development Bank, ADF Grant  10.00  11 \nGovernment  12.00  13 \n  Total  92.00  100 \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n31.  The Government will relend the proceeds of the loan portion to CAAN, the beneficiary, \nwith a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 5.0%4 per \nannum. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n32.  The  project  organization  structure  is  illustrated  in  Appendix  8.  The  implementation \narrangements have been agreed to by the Government. \n \n33.  The executing agency for the Project is CAAN, responsible for carrying out the Project, \nincluding provision of policy, technical guidance, and interagency coordination. \n \n34.  A project coordination unit (PCU), established within CAAN, will implement the Project. \nThe  PCU  is  led  by  CAAN's  deputy  director  general  of  the  Air  Transport  Planning  and \nDevelopment Directorate as the project coordinating director, who is assisted by a procurement \nofficer,  environmental  and  social  officer,  chief  project  accountant,  and  assistant  project \naccountant.  The  PCU,  as  single  point  of  contact,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nmanagement, including (i) consultant selection, (ii) procurement, (iii) withdrawal applications, (iv) \nenvironmental and social monitoring, and (v) maintenance of project accounts and completion of \nloan financial records for auditing purposes. \n \n35.  The  two  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)\u2014one  each  for  the  infrastructure  and \ncapacity  development  components\u2014are  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  monitoring  and \nexecution  of  the  respective  project  component,  including  (i)  managing  the  activities  of \nconsultants, (ii) monitoring contractors' progress, and (iii) preparing progress reports. The PIU \nfor infrastructure will be led by the project director of the TIA Improvement Project Directorate as \nthe  full-time  project  manager,  assisted  by  a  senior  civil  engineer,  two  civil  engineers,  an \nelectrical/mechanical  engineer,  and  a  CNS/air  traffic  management  engineer.  The  PIU  for \ncapacity development will be led by a full-time project manager, assisted by an assistant project \nmanager and four focal persons for the main capacity development aspects of (i) financial \nmanagement and accounting, (ii) human resources, (iii) law, policy and institutional reform, and \n(iv) airport development planning and private sector coordination. The PCU director and PIU \nproject managers will conduct weekly progress meetings to assess progress, identify potential \nissues, and formulate action plans. \n                                                 \n4  CAAN functions not only as a regulator but also as a commercially operated public corporation managing the \ncountry's airport assets. Accordingly, the relending terms are harder than those of the Asian Development Fund \nloan. \n ", "9 \n \n \n36.  Financial  management  assessment  was  carried  out;  the  details  are  in  Appendix  9.  \nCAAN operates with an adequate system of financial and management accounting, reporting, \nauditing, and internal controls. However, efficiency is weak due to staff resources and lack of a \ncomputerized information system. The Project's capacity strengthening component will help \naddress this by introducing a financial management information system consisting of accounting \nsoftware, networked computers, and training. For project implementation, the PCU will establish \nand maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing resources received \nand expenditures made for the Project, ensuring an adequate audit trail. CAAN will assign \nsuitably qualified accountants (a chief project accountant and an assistant accountant) to the \nPCU for project accounting and financial management. The Government's Office of Auditor \nGeneral will annually audit the project accounts and related financial statements in accordance \nwith  international  auditing  standards.  ADB's  direct  payment  procedure  will  be  utilized  for \nsubstantial disbursement of payments for works, goods, and consulting services. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n37.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years inclusive of preconstruction activities, \nincluding detail design, bidding documents, and procurement. It is expected that the financing \nagreement will be declared effective in January 2010, and the Project will be completed by 31 \nDecember 2014. A detailed project implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n38.  All procurement to be financed under the Project will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive \nbidding (ICB) will be used for procurement of works estimated to cost more than $1.0 million \nand goods estimated to cost more than $500,000. Shopping will be used for works and goods \nestimated to cost less than $100,000. National competitive bidding will be used for works and \ngoods estimated to cost less than that stated for ICB, in accordance with Nepal's national \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB as indicated in the procurement plan. \n \n39.  The works and equipment have been packaged to optimize construction management \nefficiency and to encourage both international and local contractors to participate in the bidding. \nA detailed procurement plan is in Appendix 7. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n40.  All consultants under the Project will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method and individual consultant selection. \n \n41.  To enhance project implementation readiness and to strengthen the capacity of CAAN, \none international and one national individual consultant will be recruited to provide project \nmanagement advisory services, including (i) pre-implementation activities, (ii) familiarization with \nADB's project administration procedures, (iii) setting up project accounts, (iv) setting up a project \nreporting system and master schedule, and (v) recruiting consultant firms. At the request of  \nCAAN, ADB will recruit the individuals using ADB's individual consultant selection method. \nCAAN, after confirming and accepting the selected individuals, will negotiate and sign contracts \nwith prior review by ADB. \n \n ", "10 \n \n42.  For detailed design and supervision, a firm of international consultants in association \nwith a national firm and/or individuals will be recruited using quality- and cost-based selection  \nprocedures, with full technical proposal and a 90:10 proportion of quality to cost, emphasizing \nquality due to the technical nature of the assignment. It is estimated that the design and \nsupervision services will be implemented over about 48 calendar months and will require about \n116 international person-months and 531 national person-months of services.  The outline \nterms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n43.  To implement the capacity development program, a firm of international consultants in \nassociation with a national firm and/or individuals will be recruited using quality- and cost-based \nselection  procedures, with a full technical proposal and a 90:10 proportion of quality to cost, \nemphasizing quality due to the high impact of the assignment deliverables. It is estimated that \nthe capacity development program will be implemented over about 36 calendar months and will \nrequire about 118 international person-months and 82 national person-months of services. A \nsingle firm or association will be recruited to carry out all the required services to optimize \ncoordination among various departments in CAAN and minimize resources required for contract \nadministration. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n44.  To  enhance  the  project  implementation  readiness,  the  Government  has  requested \nadvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  the  engagement  of  consulting  services, \nstarting  with  the  individual  consultants  for  the  project  management  advisory  service.  ADB \nsupports the Government's initiative to take advance contracting. The advance contracting and \nretroactive financing were approved in-principle during ADB's Management Review Meeting on \n25 August 2009. Retroactive financing is for expenditures incurred on consulting services during \nthe 12 months before the signing of the loan and grant agreement, subject to a cap of 20% of \nthe loan and grant amount. Advance contracting or retroactive financing is not required for \nprocurement of works and goods. The Government has been informed that ADB's support of \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to approve the project or to \nfinance the recruitment costs. The advance action schedule for consultant recruitment is in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n45.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  CAAN.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan and grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of CAAN and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n46.  The Government is strengthening its effort to fight corruption and has enacted legislation \nwith anticorruption provisions, including the Promoting Market Competition Act, 2006; Right to \nInformation Act, 2007; Special Court Act, 2002 (amended in 2007); and Anti-Money Laundering \nAct, 2008. \n \n ", "11 \n \n47.  The  Government  has  promulgated  the  Public  Procurement  Act  (2007)  and  Public \nProcurement Regulations (2007), both generally acceptable to ADB and encompassing best \ninternational  procurement  practices.  The  act  and  regulations  will  be  followed  for  national \nprocurement of goods and works, subject to any clarification or modifications required by ADB \nto ensure consistency with ADB's Procurement Guidelines. As mandated by the act, the Public \nProcurement Monitoring Office (PPMO) has been assigned as an oversight agency for overall \npublic procurement in Nepal. The PPMO5 under the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of \nMinisters is the national procurement oversight agency and is mandated to, among other things, \nmake a recommendation to the Government for reform of the procurement policy or laws, issue \ntechnical guidelines and manuals on procurement, prepare standard bidding documents, and \nconduct regular training programs for stakeholders. The PPMO will conduct trainings for CAAN \nstaff, including technical guidelines and manuals.  \n \n48.  The  Government  and  CAAN  will  announce  the  Project  and  business  opportunities \nassociated with the Project on their websites and disclose pertinent information in relation to \ngoods, works, and consulting services. \n \n49.  The National Vigilance Centre (NVC) was established in August 2002, under the direct \nsupervision and control of the prime minister of Nepal, to create awareness of corruption and \nactivities to prevent corruption. The NVC uses preventive and promotional measures, and acts \nagainst corrupt activities with effective good governance. The NVC was established pursuant to \nChapter 4 of the Anti-corruption Act, 2002. Under NVC guidelines, CAAN will appoint certified \nauditors, acceptable to NVC, to conduct a technical audit of the Project to examine how well the \nplanned or design criteria are met by the Project within the allocated time frame and budget. \nSeparate technical audits will be conducted during the following stages: (i) at the planning and \ndesign  stage  (focusing  on  preliminary  planning  and  designing  related  with  quality  and \nadequacy) (ii) at the procurement stage (focusing on purchase of service and equipment mainly \nrelated with transparency and requirements of funding agencies), and (iii) at the implementation \nstage (focusing on accomplishment or construction that is mainly related with quality schedule \nand budget). The time frame for technical audits and their report format will be discussed during \nthe ADB project inception mission. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n50.  Loan  disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and the agreed detail arrangements. Direct \npayment procedure will be used for progress payments on civil works, consultants' fees, and \nprocurement of goods. Separate imprest accounts will be established for the loan and grant \nportions. To expedite disbursement during implementation, as approved by ADB per specific \ncase, statements of expenditure will be used to reimburse, liquidate, or replenish the imprest \naccount for any individual payments not exceeding the equivalent of $100,000 from the loan and \n$80,000 from the grant. CAAN will establish separate imprest accounts for the loan and for the \ngrant at the Nepal Rastra Bank (Central Bank). For the loan and grant portions, initial advances \nand maximum amount to be deposited to the imprest accounts will, in total, be equivalent to the \nestimated eligible expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan or grant amount, \nwhichever is lower.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB is providing a technical assistance to strengthen the PPMO to implement requirements of the newly enacted \nact and regulations. \n ", "12 \n \n51.  CAAN  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  project  accounts,  including  monthly \nreconciliation of the accounts and provision of supportive documents for withdrawal applications \nfor liquidation or replenishment of the account. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n52.  CAAN  will  maintain  separate  project  records  and  accounts  to identify  the  financing \nresources received and expenditures made on the Project. The project accounts and related \nfinancial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards set by \nthe auditor general or independent auditors appointed by the auditor general acceptable to \nADB. The audited reports and financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year. To reach the target, the unaudited reports and financial \nstatements will be submitted to the auditor general within 2 months after the end of each fiscal \nyear. The imprest accounts and statements of expenditure will be audited as part of the regular \nannual audit. The auditor\u2019s opinion of the examination of the imprest account and statements of \nexpenditure will be set out in the auditor\u2019s report. CAAN is aware of ADB's policy on delayed \nsubmission and also of the importance of satisfactory and acceptable audited reports. ADB \nreserves the right to verify the financial accounts of CAAN to confirm that the share of ADB's \nfinancing is used in accordance with ADB's policies and procedures \n \n53.  CAAN will separately prepare and submit to ADB monthly progress reports in electronic \nform, containing basic data, implementation progress, major issues and proposed remedial \nmeasures, and work to be undertaken in the following period. The monthly reports should be \nreceived by ADB within 15 days of the end of the month. Every quarter, CAAN will submit a \nconsolidated progress report to ADB. In addition to the basic information provided in the monthly \nreports, the quarterly reports will include any changes to the implementation schedule, report on \nperformance monitoring (including achievement of outputs and outcome), compliance with loan \ncovenants, summary financial account for the Project, expenditures to date, and the results of \nmonitoring of the social and environmental impacts. The format and content of both monthly and \nquarterly reports will be attached to the project administration memorandum to be agreed upon \nat the project inception mission. \n \n54.  Within 3 months of project completion, CAAN will submit to ADB a project completion \nreport with a detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, contractors' and consultants' \nperformance,  social  and  economic  impact,  economic  rate  of  return,  and  other  details  as \nrequested by ADB. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  CAAN will, within 3 months of the effectiveness date of the legal agreements, develop a \nsystematic project performance monitoring system, in a form and substance acceptable to ADB, \nfor use throughout the life of the Project. CAAN will establish a baseline for performance \nindicators to be used for monitoring implementation, and thereafter conduct annual evaluation \nsurveys, in accordance with the project performance monitoring system to evaluate the scope, \nimplementation arrangements, progress, and achievements of the Project's objectives. \n \n10.  Project Review \n56.  A project inception mission will be fielded soon after the legal agreements for the Project \nare signed; thereafter, regular reviews will follow at least annually. As necessary, special loan \nadministration missions and a midterm review mission will be fielded, under which any changes \n ", "13 \n \nin scope or implementation arrangement may be required to ensure achievement of project \nobjectives. CAAN will monitor project implementation in accordance with the schedule and time-\nbound milestones, and keep ADB informed of any significant deviations that may result in the \nmilestones not being met. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Technical Benefit \n57.  The  main  technical  benefit  will  be  enhanced  compliance  with  international  safety \nstandards and recommended practices, and improved aircraft and passenger handling capacity. \nThe  Project  will  bring  TIA's  airside  infrastructure  into  compliance  with  Annex  14  of  the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with respect to airside safety standards. It will (i) \nimprove the safety of air traffic services, air navigation, and communications; (ii) increase the \nrunway capacity to accommodate aircraft movements more efficiently; (iii) increase the capacity \nof the passenger terminal buildings and car parks to accommodate forecast passenger traffic; \nand (iv) provide significant improvement in the water supply and sewage waste disposal. The \nimpact at TIA is a safer operating environment for international and domestic airlines and \nimproved  passenger  experience  and  confidence.  While  TIA  will  be  the  main  focus  of  the \nimprovements, the Project will also enhance safety and basic facilities at three remote domestic \nairports\u2014Lukla,  Rara,  and  Simikot\u2014including,  among  other  improvements,  upgraded \ncommunication equipment, improved visual approach guidance and weather equipment, and \nrunway surfacing. The three airports serve remote areas that are otherwise inaccessible by \nroad. The improved safety at the remote domestic airports will help ensure accessibility for local \ncommunities and support tourism development. \n \nB.  Institutional Benefit \n58.  The Project will improve the organization effectiveness of CAAN in terms of operational \nefficiency, management capacity, long- and short-term planning, staffing, and training. This will \nenhance the quality of Nepal's air transport services, as well as the manner in which they are \nadministered and managed. \n \nC.  Economic and Financial Aspect \n59.  The economic assessment was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects.6  By  improving  safety  and  easing  capacity  constraints,  the \nProject will help ensure continued passenger traffic growth. The economic benefits are derived \nfrom the additional air traffic that will be generated and/or retained as a result of the Project. The \nProject  will  generate  several  types  of  economic  benefits,  including  an  increase  in  tourist \nspending derived from additional tourist arrivals, and additional aeronautical and commercial \nrevenues received by the airport from this induced new traffic. The economic internal rate of \nreturn for the project investment is estimated at 23.6%. A sensitivity analysis tested the effects \nof possible unfavorable scenarios resulting from changes in the key parameters that determine \nthe Project\u2019s costs and benefits. This analysis indicates that the Project\u2019s economic viability \nwould remain satisfactory even under adverse scenarios, and that it would require a cost \nincrease of 78% or a decrease in benefits of 39% to reach a cut-off economic internal rate of \nreturn of 12%. The details of the economic assessment are in Appendix 10. \n \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "14 \n \n60.  The financial assessment for the project investment was undertaken using constant \n2009 prices. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of \nthe airport under with-project and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR) for the three traffic scenarios, computed on an after-tax basis, ranges from 14.5% to \n14.9%, with the most likely traffic scenario having an FIRR of 14.7%. This is well above the \naverage cost of capital for the project funds (8.25%) or even commercial lending rates in the \ncountry. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that the Project's FIRR is robust under adverse \nconditions when compared with the average cost of capital. Based on the financial projections \nand financial evaluation, the Project is considered both financially viable and sustainable. The \ndetails of the financial assessment are in Appendix 10. \n \nD.  Financial Sustainability \n61.  Assessment of the financial sustainability of the project investments has been carried out \nconsidering the incremental financial benefits. Estimates of incremental revenue and financial \nprojections associated with the incremental investment for the project have been prepared to \nassess the Project\u2019s financial viability and sustainability as a whole. The incremental financial \nrevenues will be sufficient to cover debt service as well as meet the additional operating and \nmaintenance costs. Therefore, the Project's investment is fully viable financially. The details of \nthe financial sustainability assessment are in Appendix 9. \n \nE.  Social Impacts \n62.  Livelihood and Poverty Reduction. Most of the impact zones (Humla, Mugu, and \nSolukhumbu)  are  located  among  the  poorest  districts  in  the  country  in  terms  of  Human \nDevelopment Index and other development indicators. Nepal's national poverty rate is about \n31%; poverty rates in these districts are 42% in Humla, 51% in Mugu, and 46% in Solukhumbu. \nThe conditions in the immediate impact zone, the district headquarters, are marginally better. In \nKathmandu, although the poverty rate near the TIA is low (4.4%), the immediate impact zone is \nmuch poorer, and field study reveals that poverty here could be as high as 15%. \n \n63.  A socioeconomic survey covering 17% of the 300 households in the project-influenced \narea, and four public consultations and two focus group discussions, were conducted to gather \nfeedback  from  the  local  communities  on  the  proposed  development  and  perceived \nsocioeconomic impacts. The survey suggests that the primary beneficiaries of the airports in \nremote areas are the people who are geographically excluded and who have no access to road \ntransport.  The  primary  beneficiaries  are  the  people  in  remote  areas  who  will  benefit  from \nreduced  prices  in  transportation  and  through  reduced  prices  of  goods  and  commodities. \nWomen, the sick, and the elderly will also benefit with access to air transport service in case of \nemergency. The other benefits will be derived indirectly through promotion of tourism and \nopportunities to expand business. Employment opportunities in tourism will be enhanced. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n64.  Gender. The Project will have no interference with the community because it is confined \nwithin the airport boundary. However, gender participation was ensured during the course of the \nsocial  study  by  undertaking  a  process  of  gender  analysis  to  assess  the  possible  gender \nimpacts. Two focus group discussions were undertaken with women belonging to different \nsocioeconomic  groups  such  as  high-income  groups,  the  poor,  and  households  headed  by \nwomen.  The  majority  of  the  women  felt  positively  about  the  possible  benefits,  including \nemployment  opportunities  from  construction  and  extra  income  from  peripheral  business \nopportunities such as tea shops and restaurants. The socioeconomic survey also revealed that \n ", "15 \n \nwomen in the project-influenced area were mainly involved in household chores, wage work at \nhome (such as woolen threadmaking for the nearby factories), small business, shops, and \nfarming. There are few women engaged as teachers, government officials, and nongovernment \norganizations. There are women\u2019s groups operating adult literacy classes in the ward office in \nthe community. CAAN will ensure that the local communities are given priority for possible \nemployment related to the Project, and the contractors will not differentiate wages between men \nand women for work of equal value. Civil works contracts will include specific clauses on the \nundertakings, and compliance will be strictly monitored by CAAN assisted by the supervision \nconsultant. \n \n65.  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous People. The civil works improvements at \nTIA and remote domestic airports are within the present airport boundaries, and there is no \nacquisition  of  private  land  or  property.  No  physical  displacement  is  envisaged,  and  no \nindigenous people will be affected by the Project. \n \n66.  HIV/AIDS. The social assessments undertaken have not indicated any significant risks \nwith regard to HIV/AIDS. Of the households surveyed, 85% know about HIV/AIDS and its \nprecautionary measures; about 90% are aware of the disease and know about the causes of \ninfection. Consultations with government officials, nongovernment organization personnel, and \ncommunity leaders revealed that the public health offices regularly support small activities such \nas celebrating AIDS Day and conducting HIV/AIDS awareness classes with school teachers. \nCAAN  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contractors,  by  contractual  requirement,  disseminate \ninformation at worksites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for those \nemployed  during  construction.  CAAN,  assisted  by  the  supervision  consultant,  will  monitor \ncompliance during project implementation. \n \nF.  Environmental Impacts \n67.  The  Project  is  classified  B  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines, and requires initial environmental examinations (IEEs). According to the Nepalese \nEnvironment Protection Act 1997, expansion of airports requires environmental clearance by the \nministry concerned\u2014the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation (MOTCA). The Project is not \nexpected  to  have  any  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  due  to  the  proposed \nimprovement program at all four airports. Improvement works are within the existing airport \nboundaries with no encroachment on sensitive ecological areas. All four airports, except for \nRara,  are  away  from  any  of  the  protected  or  sensitive  areas.  The  potential  impacts  from \nimprovement  works  are  primarily  confined  to  the  construction  stage  and  are  temporary  in \nnature. No impact is anticipated on flora and fauna except loss of some trees, which has been \nassessed to be minor. Nevertheless, for each tree lost, CAAN will plant four new trees. The \nimpacts during the operation stage are also minimal and are primarily related to the operation \nand maintenance of aircraft, and the operation of incineration and sewage treatment plants. For \nSimikot and Rara airports, the improvements could lead to induced development near the \nairport. Therefore, CAAN and the local village development committees will jointly assess and \nadapt appropriate strategies to regulate development near the respective airports. All of the \nidentified impacts could be mitigated with minor or negligible residual impacts and can be \nreduced to acceptable levels by implementing the proposed environmental management plan \n(EMP). CAAN will be responsible for implementing and monitoring mitigation measures defined \nin the EMP. In case of a change to a project component, CAAN will update the IEE and revise \nthe EMP as required, and submit it to ADB for review. The summary IEE including the EMP is in \nSupplementary Appendix A. The full IEE is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n ", "16 \n \nG.  Project Risks \n68.  Implementation Capacity. CAAN has prior experience with implementing ADB-funded \nprojects, although it does not have recent experience. The PCU and PIU staff are being trained \non up-to-date implementation procedures through ADB-sponsored seminars and workshops. \nThe risk of procurement delay is being mitigated through CAAN\u2019s advance action of project \nmanagement  advisory  services,  consisting  of  an  international  and  a  national  individual \nconsultant who will provide advice during consultant recruitment and procurement processes. \nADB prior review will facilitate the approval process of bid evaluation. Support will be provided \nby the detail design and supervision consultant throughout the Project. Training on safeguard \nrequirements will be provided to CAAN officials by environment and resettlement specialists \nunder the design and construction supervision consultants to mitigate delays due to procedural \nclearance. \n \n69.  Maintenance. CAAN generates sufficient revenue to cover the routine maintenance \nrequirements. CAAN's maintenance management and planning capabilities will be strengthened \nunder the Project's capacity development component. CAAN will implement the maintenance \nprogram and allocate sufficient budget to meet requirements. \n \n70.  Implementation Environment. There are general risks associated with the internal \nsecurity  situation  in  certain  parts  of  the  country,  which  can  hinder  construction  activities. \nHowever, potential risk to the Project is minor as the main component of the Project is situated \nin the capital area of Kathmandu, and the works are within the confined and secured area of the \nrespective airports. \n \n71.  Procurement. The Procurement risks will be mitigated by adapting (i) ADB's prior review \nprocess, and (ii) the Government's technical audits conducted under the supervision of the \nNational  Vigilance  Centre  (NVC).  All  works  and  goods  packages  are  procured  using  ICB \nprocedures. The potential risk is further reduced due to the nature of the improvement works \nand goods being procured, which are mainly superstructure works and specialized equipment, \nwhich facilitates easier verification of quantity and quality. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n72.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and CAAN have provided the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n73.  Project Management. CAAN will provide the PCU and PIUs with adequate and suitably \nqualified  staff,  resources,  and  facilities  to  implement  the  Project,  including  a  chief  project \naccountant and assistant accountant.  \n \n74.  Maintenance. CAAN will develop an annual maintenance program and provide sufficient \nbudget  for  undertaking  the  preventive  and  routine  maintenance  throughout  the  project \nimplementation. \n \n75.  Counterpart Funds. The Government and CAAN will ensure the timely and adequate \nprovision of all counterpart funds for the Project. \n \n ", "17 \n \n76.  Labor. CAAN will ensure that civil works contractors comply with all applicable labor \nlaws and regulations, do not employ child labor for construction and maintenance activities, and \nprovide  appropriate  facilities  for  women  and  children  in  construction  campsites.  Local \ncommunities  will  be  given  priority  to  be  employed  by  the  Project.  Contractors  will  not \ndifferentiate  wages  between  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  A  specific  clause \nensuring this will be included in bidding documents. CAAN will cooperate with the Department of \nLabor to monitor the implementation of this clause. \n \n77.  Environment. The Government will ensure that CAAN will \n \n(i)  ensure effective implementation of mitigation measures defined under the EMP; \n(ii)  ensure that EMP requirements are included as bill of quantity in the bidding \ndocuments  and  operating  contracts,  and  that  the  bidding  document  and \ncontractor\u2019s budget include a line item for review and upgrade of the EMP; \n(iii)  designate  one  environment  and  social  officer  to  closely  monitor  the \nimplementation of the EMP as well as statutory requirements; \n(iv)  submit the monitoring outcome to ADB and relevant agencies as part of progress \nreports on project implementation; \n(v)  undertake an institutional environmental capacity building program as suggested \nby, but not limited to, the EMP to enhance the capacity of CAAN officials; and \n(vi)  review and update the EMP, in case of any changes to project components, and \nsend the revised EMP to ADB for review and decision on the need to undertake \nadditional environmental assessment studies. \n \n78.  From the end of FY2010 onwards, CAAN shall maintain a debt service coverage ratio of \nat least 1.3. \n \n79.  The Government and CAAN shall ensure that any change in the organizational structure \nof CAAN does not affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Project Agreement. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan and Grant Effectiveness \n80.  In addition to the standard conditions for effectiveness, the Government and CAAN must \nhave  executed  a  subsidiary  financing  agreement  satisfactory  to  ADB,  under  which  the \nGovernment relends the proceeds of the loan and grant to the CAAN. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n81.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 44,388,000 to \nNepal for the Air Transport Capacity Enhancement Project from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft Financing and Project Agreements \npresented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the  grant  not  exceeding  $10,000,000  to  Nepal,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, for the Air Transport Capacity Enhancement Project, on terms and \n ", "18 \n \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nFinancing and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  19 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data   \nDesign    Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Performance Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Risk \nImproved transport  By 2017, annual number of passengers increase by  Civil Aviation  Traffic volume \nconnectivity in  75% for international and 55% for domestic  Authority of Nepal  affected by \nNepal  passengers from 2008 figures.  global economy \nor domestic \nsecurity \nsituation \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved safety  By project completion, safety standard is enhanced  ICAO's safety audit  Timely delivery \nand capacity at TIA in accordance with the best international practices,  and assessment  of the Project \n  including:     \n  (i) RWY-parallel TWY meet safety separation   \n  distance of 182.5 meters; (ii) RWY strip is clear of   \n  obstacles; (iii) international apron meets safety   \n  separation requirements; (iv) category 1 precision   \n  approach lights are operational for RWY 02 and   \n  simple approach lights are operational for RWY 20,   \n  and airport emergency service improves from ICAO's   \n  Rescue Fire Fighting Category 8 to 9.   \n     \n  TIA's annual passenger handling capacity is  Civil Aviation \n  increased from 1.8 mppa to 2.9 mppa (international),  Authority of Nepal \n  and from 1.0 mppa to 1.5 mppa (domestic).   \n     \n  Level of service for domestic terminal improves from  Civil Aviation \n  IATA's grade D to B standard.

Introduction \n1.  Air transport has played a significant role in the administrative, economic, and social \ndevelopment of Nepal. In the absence of adequate surface transport it has provided essential \nlinks between Kathmandu (the capital city) and the various administrative and commercial \ncenters of the country, as well as with the outside world. For many mountainous and remote \nrural districts of the country, air transport services provided by seven scheduled domestic \nairlines operating small and medium aircraft, and six other airlines operating rotary wing aircraft \non a chartered basis, also provide the only means of mechanized transport to connect them to \nother areas. Further, civil aviation is of critical importance to the country because most tourists \narrive by air. The sector provides vital support to the development of tourism as well as to trade, \nmanufacturing, and commerce. In light of the vital role played by civil aviation, and the uniquely \nhazardous aviation environment, it is of utmost importance that the primary objective of the \nProject is to ensure and improve safety. \n \nB.  Air Transport Operations (International/Domestic Airlines) and Traffic Growth \n2.  Nepal  has  47  airports,  comprising  one  international  airport  (Tribhuvan  International \nAirport  [TIA]  in  Kathmandu),  four  regional  airports,  and  42  other  domestic  airport  facilities \ncomprising airports, airstrips, and short take-off and landing aerodromes. Of the 42 domestic \nairports, only 27 are operational. International air services are provided at TIA by the national \nairline (Nepal Airlines Corporation) and 20 other international airlines, which serve 21 foreign \ndestinations in 14 countries. Domestic commercial air services are provided by seven domestic \nair carriers, offering both fixed and rotary wing scheduled and charter services. Twenty one \nmain domestic destinations are served by regular scheduled domestic services, including the \nfour regional airports of Bhairawa, Biratnagar, Nepalgung, and Pokhara. The principal domestic \nairlines are Yeti Airlines and Buddha Air. \n \n3.  International air traffic (1.83 million passengers in 2008) is dominated by tourism, the \nlabor market traffic for the Middle East and Asia, and business visitors. Aside from Nepal \nAirlines, the principal international airlines serving Kathmandu are Gulf Air, Indian Airlines, Jet \nAirways, Qatar Airways, and Thai Airways, which account for more than 70% of the international \npassenger traffic. Domestic traffic (1.04 million passengers in 2008), comprises tourism for \nthose  airports  serving  the  tourist  regions  (especially  Lukla  and  Pokhara),  religious  visitors \n(Bhairawa and other destinations of religious significance), and local Nepalese passengers \ntraveling between Kathmandu and other regional and remote destinations. The domestic air \nservices carry a considerable amount of freight due to the limited road system and ground \ntransportation services. \n \n4.  The  volume  of  air  traffic,  expressed  in  terms  of  air  passengers,  has  increased \nconsiderably over the past 20 years, with annual growth rates varying from 7% to more than \n17% per annum. Declines in passenger traffic have also been recorded for some years, notably \nin 1997 (Asian financial crisis), 2000\u20132002 (the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States in \n2001 and outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and 2006 (political instability in \nNepal). In 2007 and 2008, strong growth in excess of 12% per year was recorded for passenger \ntraffic and 7%\u20138% in aircraft movements. \n \n5.  Most of the air traffic activity in Nepal takes place at TIA, as this is the only airport \nserving the international airlines and is also the base for all of the domestic airlines. Air transport \n ", "  Appendix 2  23 \noperations at TIA are shaped by the type of market served: principally inbound tourists and \noutbound workers on the international services, and tourists and local Nepalese traffic on the \ndomestic services. The tourist traffic arriving in Nepal is largely focused on the trekking districts, \nfollowed by the Kathmandu valley. However, inbound tourists do not connect directly from \ninternational flights to the domestic services, but rather travel to the interior of Nepal after a few \ndays in Kathmandu. The international and domestic terminals at TIA operate independently. \n \n6.  Most international operations take place during day time. Although there are several \ninternational  operations  after  dark,  some  airlines  choose  not  to  operate  at  night  citing \ninadequacies in air navigation and lighting equipment. Demand for international facilities is \ntherefore heavy at times during the day time, with peaks experienced on the international apron \nand in the international terminal building. Domestic services, which are characterized by being \nshort haul and operated by small and medium turboprop aircraft, operate throughout the day, \nbut not at night. However, as many of these services operate into the higher regions of the \nHimalayan mountain chain, domestic schedules are heavy in the mornings due to the difficulties \nposed by strong winds later in the day. The relatively concentrated nature of the schedules of \nthe international airlines, and especially those of the domestic services, is such that there is \nheavy demand for aircraft parking on both the international and domestic aprons at TIA. \n \n7.  Air traffic levels in Nepal, and especially at TIA, are forecast to continue to grow. For \nTIA, passenger traffic (international and domestic) is forecast to increase from 2.8 million annual \npassengers  in  2008  to  4.6  million  annual  passengers  by  2013,  and  to  9.3  million  annual \npassengers by 2028. This assumes that appropriate additional capacity is added at TIA to \naccommodate this growth. \n \nC.  Civil Aviation Infrastructure\u2014Safety and Capacity \n8.  TIA is the main gateway to Nepal; around 80% of all tourists arrive by air through TIA on \ntheir way to the domestic destinations within the country. Thus, TIA is a major contributor to the \nsocioeconomic development of the country and needs to be upgraded to meet the growth of \ntraffic. \n \n9.  While TIA has evolved with the traffic growth, it has not been subjected to systematic \nplanning  of  its  development,  and  this  has  led  to  some  nonconformance  with  international \nstandards  and  recommended  practices  promulgated  by  the  International  Civil  Aviation \nOrganization (ICAO). As the air traffic increases, it is imperative that the airport develops in a \nsystematic way to improve the safety of aircraft operations. \n \n10.  An evaluation of the existing facilities and services at the country\u2019s main airport reveals \nmany areas of concern from a safety perspective. These cover (i) the inadequacy of the runway \nend safety areas, (ii) non-availability of a simple landing visual aids system for aircraft landing \nfrom the north, (iii) the parallel taxiway being within the runway strip, (iv) the international apron \nbeing too close to the runway, (v) a severely congested domestic terminal building, (vi) the \nexisting international terminal building fast approaching capacity, (vii) existing navigational aids \nbeing  outdated  and  needing  urgent  replacement,  (viii)  aircraft  operations  and  air  traffic \nmanagement requiring a review and updating, (ix) inadequate water supply and power supply, \nand (x) the lack of a sewage treatment and waste disposal system. Therefore, implementation \nof the airport master plan is necessary to address the safety concerns of aircraft operations at \nTIA. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  24 \n \nD.  Civil Aviation Administration \n11.  Responsibility for the regulation of civil aviation and operation of the nation\u2019s airports and \nthe air traffic control and navigation system was originally vested in the Department of Civil \nAviation, which was established within the Ministry of Works, Communications and Transport in \n1957. This arrangement persisted until 1998, when the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) \nwas  established.  Enabled  by  the  CAAN  Act,  CAAN  is  an  autonomous  state  authority, \nsupervised by the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation. On formation, CAAN took over the \nregulatory and operational responsibilities of the Department of Civil Aviation, as well as most of \nthe Department of Civil Aviation staff.  \n \n12.  Legal authority for the government to regulate civil aviation was established in 1960 \nthrough the Civil Aviation Act which, although amended periodically, remains the fundamental \nenabling legislation for regulation of civil aviation in Nepal. The legislation requires review and \namendment to reflect current conditions and the responsibilities of CAAN. Regulations have \nbeen made under the Civil Aviation Act, as well as under the CAAN Act, to enforce regulation, \nhowever  there  is  now  duplication  of  regulations  under  these  acts  and  a  rationalization  is \nrequired. Civil aviation regulations made under the CAAN Act have been prepared to cover \nsome but not all of the ICAO annexes, and these need to be completed to bring all civil aviation \nregulation into line with current requirements and best practice. \n \n13.  CAAN is organized into two basic components\u2014a management group comprising four \ndirectorates and two departments, and a specialist group comprising five divisions. The total \nstaff complement is 774, which is below the approved staffing level of 1,065 and represents a \nvacancy  rate  of  27%  of  approved  positions.  The  management  group  is  responsible  for \nmanaging and operating the national airports, the air traffic and air navigation systems, and for \nimplementing  major  airport  projects,  managing  the  development  and  training  of  human \nresources  (including  operation  of  the  Civil  Aviation  Training  Academy),  assessing  and \ncertificating air transport operators, and managing CAAN\u2019s corporate plan. The specialist group \nis responsible for aviation safety regulation, security, facility inspections, and standardization, \nand serves as a technical advisory service to the director general of CAAN. \n \n14.  CAAN fulfills its functions of regulating civil aviation and operating the national airports \nand  air  traffic  and  air  navigation  systems.  Its  performance  in  regulating  civil  aviation  has \nensured that a good safety record has been achieved for air transport operations in Nepal\u2019s \nuniquely hazardous aviation environment, while the operation of the airport and air navigation \nsystem has generated a profit for CAAN since 2004. CAAN\u2019s performance has been hampered \nby a shortage of qualified and trained staff in both the regulatory and operational functions, \nwhich has placed the organization under pressure. A lack of management systems, such as \ncomputerization and information management, has also limited the capability and efficiency with \nwhich the organization operates. \n \nE.  Financial Performance and Sustainability \n15.  CAAN\u2019s financial performance has improved considerably since its establishment in \n1998. The early years of operation resulted in operating losses; however, this was turned \naround by FY2004, when a positive net operating profit was first recorded. From FY2004 \nonwards, CAAN has been in a profitable position in every year to 2007/08 (the latest year for \nwhich data is currently available). CAAN does not pay an annual dividend to its shareholder (the \nGovernment of Nepal) but is subjected to company tax at 26.5% and to a 13% value-added tax \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \non its operations. In addition, CAAN is repaying external loans, such as provided by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), through the Government at 8%. Together with its obligation to pay \ntaxes (despite its status as a state authority), this reduces its retained earnings. \n \n16.  In FY2008, CAAN\u2019s revenues were NRs1.93 billion (approximately $25 million). These \nwere generated from airport aeronautical charges (71% of revenues derived from the passenger \nservice charge, aircraft landing fees, aircraft parking and hangarage charges, and an aviation \nfuel surcharge), non-aeronautical charges generated from commercial activities (21%), air traffic \nservices  charges  (6%),  and  regulation  (1%).  Operating  expenses  in  the  same  year  were \nNRs550 million ($7.1 million), comprising payroll costs and benefits (53%), direct operating \nexpenses (31%), and administrative and general expenses (16%). \n \n17.  The profitability of CAAN is, in the main, attributable to the operation of TIA, which \ngenerates almost 91% of CAAN\u2019s total revenue. The four regional airports account for only 5% \nof total revenues, but taken together return a profit to CAAN of just over NRs31.5 million; only \nthree of the four regional airports are profitable. Of a further 27 operating domestic airports, only \nfour are profitable on operations; however, many of these domestic airports serve remote areas \nand are operated largely for social and administrative reasons. In aggregate, operation of the 27 \ndomestic airports comes close to breaking even, returning only a very small loss. \n \n18.  It is clear that the financial performance of CAAN is very much determined by the \nfinancial performance of TIA, and its ability to accommodate increasing air traffic and passenger \nlevels. In turn, this is partly dependent upon the ability of the airport to continue to operate \nsatisfactorily, retain and increase traffic, and maintain its equipment and facilities. In this last \nrespect, CAAN\u2019s overall level of expenditure on maintenance is an estimated NRs44.7 million, \nor 25% of direct operating costs, which is lower than would normally be expected, suggesting a \nlower than desirable level of maintenance effort. \n \nF.  Main Sector Issues \n1.  Safety Issues at Tribhuvan International Airport, Lukla, Rara, and Simikot \n \n19.  The main issues affecting TIA are summarized as follows: \n \n(i)  As the larger code 4E aircraft are operating regularly at the airport, in the interest \nof safety the airport infrastructure must be brought into compliance with the \nrelevant standards.  \n(ii)  The current layout of the taxiways has resulted in inefficient operations, and it is \nespecially noticeable during departures by large aircraft on runway 02 as the \nrunway is also used as a taxiway. Aircraft backtracking on the runway closes the \nfacility for other aircraft operations, and is a safety and capacity constraint.   \n(iii)  The existing parallel taxiway is too close to the runway and is within the runway \nstrip.  Similarly,  the  international  apron  is  also  not  in  conformity  with  ICAO \nspecifications due to its proximity to the runway leading to a code E aircraft tail \npenetrating the transitional surface. \n(iv)  Both the domestic and international aprons need to be relocated and capacities \nincreased to cater to future demand. \n(v)  As  a  result  of  the  higher-than-standard  departure  gradient  required  for \ninstrument-only  operations,  some  international  aircraft  operations  may  be \nrestricted in terms of take-off weight due to the requirement to maintain a high \nrate of climb on departure from TIA. \n ", "  Appendix 2  26 \n(vi)  While  the  domestic  terminal  building  is  operating  beyond  its  capacity,  the \ninternational building is nearing its rated peak capacity. In addition, the existing \ndomestic terminal building and the military and Nepal Airlines hangars obstruct \nthe line of sight from the air traffic control tower. The domestic terminal building \nshould be demolished and the hangars should be relocated to the east of the \nrunway. Construction of a new international terminal building and refurbishment \nof the existing one into a domestic terminal building are proposed.   \n(vii)  Inadequate electrical power supply and prolonged power failures leave essential \ncomponents  of  the  airport  without  electricity,  thereby  impacting  airport \noperational safety and efficiency. Future electrical loads must be assessed and \nadequate provisions made to meet the requirements. Use of solar energy to \naugment the municipal electrical supply has been proposed. \n(viii)  The  inadequate  water  supply  situation  must  be  addressed  by  developing \nadditional bore wells, installing a water treatment and purification plant, and \nhaving a distribution system. Rainwater harvesting has been recommended. \n(ix)  All  sewage  and  waste  water  from  the  airport  is  not  being  treated  before \ndischarging into the nearby Bagmati River. A new sewage treatment plant and \nwaste disposal system must be installed to ensure that the river is not polluted.   \n(x)  TIA\u2019s emergency services need upgraded equipment and staff training programs \nto be able to provide ICAO rescue and firefighting category 9 level of protection. \n \n20.  Lukla Airport. The airport has extreme longitudinal slope on the runway due to the \nterrain. It does not have any navigational aid to assist in the approach and landing of aircraft, \nespecially needed when the visibility is not optimum. This has a serious impact on the safety of \noperations. The ground infrastructure is reported to be otherwise satisfactory considering the \ncurrent traffic pattern. \n \n21.  Simikot Airport. The airport does not have a paved runway, taxiway, or apron, although \nCAAN is undertaking this paving project. The runway length is just adequate for aircraft carrying \nlimited payload, and the landing approach is difficult. The air traffic control tower is old and \nneeds refurbishing, and the communication and meteorological equipment needs upgrading. As \nand when the traffic increases, the existing terminal building will need either expansion or \nreplacement. The airport needs snow removal equipment as, during some parts of winter, the \nairport is forced to close. There are no visual aids other than a single wind direction indicator at \none end of the runway strip. \n \n22.  Rara Airport. This airport does not have any paved surfaces. The landing strip (or the \nrunway) has a steep longitudinal slope, although it is deemed useful in the deceleration of a \nlanding aircraft, and the approach is difficult. There is no terminal building or clearly marked \napron and taxiway (unlike at Simikot airport). There are no navigational aids, air traffic control \ntower, or meteorological equipment other than a sole wind direction indicator. The runway ends \nare hazardous with very steep land falls. \n \n2.  Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Capacity Building  \n \na.  Human Resources Development \n \n23.  CAAN  suffers  from  a  shortage  of  qualified  and  trained  staff.  The  current  staff \ncomplement is 774, as against an authorized staffing level of 1,065. Consequently, CAAN is \nunderstaffed by 27%. The greatest issues arising from this present understaffing are that CAAN \nis short of staff in areas that are critical to its functions as a regulator of civil aviation and as the \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \noperator of the airports and air traffic and air navigation system. Of greatest concern as far as \nregulation is concerned is the lack of qualified and trained staff to fulfill the safety regulation \nfunctions, particularly in the areas of airworthiness inspection and certification, flight operations, \nand personnel licensing.  \n \n24.  CAAN\u2019s civil aviation academy trains air traffic controllers, including subjects on security, \nfire fighting, aeronautical information publishing, and ramp safety. The civil aviation academy \ncan only produce 13\u201315 qualified controllers each year. for aerodrome control functions. This \ndoes  not  keep  up  with  the  need  for  staff  replacements  due  to  retirement,  migration  into \nmanagement, or loss to the private sector. \n \n25.  Staff  shortages  that  affect  the  ability  of  CAAN  to  operate  the  airports  safely  and \nefficiently  are  reported  to  exist  in  the  areas  of  airport  maintenance  and  operations,  and \nmaintenance of electrical and electronic equipment necessary for safe flight operations. TIA, \nparticularly, is critically short of maintenance engineers, which has resulted in maintenance work \nnot being performed and facilities and equipment becoming rundown and unusable. Qualified \nmaintenance engineers are reported to be in short supply due to low salaries, competing \nopportunities, and the effect of CAAN\u2019s own personnel rules for recruitment and training. \n \n26.  While the level of staff salaries is a concern that needs to be addressed, this arises as a \nresult of failure to keep salaries in line with the marketplace and thereby being affected by the \ncompeting effects of the private sector to attract new recruits. The CAAN\u2019s own personnel rules \nexacerbate the situation, especially with regard to training\u2014training cannot be given to new \nrecruits until they have served within CAAN for 4 years. This is acknowledged by CAAN\u2019s \nPersonnel Department as creating disillusionment among new recruits, and accounts for a \nhigher  than  desirable  turnover  rate  among  new  staff.  This  situation  (which  is  solvable)  is \nexacerbating the staffing problems since, at the top of the organization, CAAN also faces loss of \nsenior staff through retirement at a relatively young age of 58. \n \n27.  A further issue that has prevented some of the vacant positions within the CAAN from \nbeing  filled  arises  from  the  position  and  staff  grading  system  that  is  in  place  within  the \norganization. All positions are assigned a grade level, as are the staff. However, staff cannot be \ntransferred laterally within the same grade level, and can only be promoted up into a vacant \nposition at a higher grade level. This system has the effect of preventing mobility of staff on the \none hand, and ensuring that some positions remain unfilled on the other. This, too, is solvable, \nalthough regrading will be required and a fresh approach taken to the manner in which staff can \nbe transferred within the organization, to ensure that critical vacancies can be filled. \n \n28.  In terms of capacity building for human resources development, there is a need to (i) \naddress both the salary levels and the position and staff grading system, and (ii) revise the \npersonnel rules to support the development of the organization. At the same time, assistance to \nCAAN is needed to (i) establish appropriate budgets for departments through development of a \nbusiness plan for the organization, and (ii) assist in recruiting staff. There is also a need to \ndevelop a training program for the entire organization, and to put that into effect. In the capacity \nbuilding program under the loan project, it is proposed to provide specific training to CAAN staff \nwhere deficiencies are found to exist. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  28 \n \nb.  Financial Management and Information System \n \n29.  CAAN operates within an environment where computerization has not been applied, \nexcept in very few offices. In general, the top management have access to computers, mainly \nfor email and internet access, but these are not networked and do not share information. Only \nthe Civil Engineering Division uses computers to any significant degree, and then principally for \ncomputer drafting. A small local area network is in place within this division to link these \ncomputers and enable staff to share files, and to store files electronically. \n \n30.  In  this  environment,  information  cannot  generally  be  shared  among  staff,  or  stored \nelectronically.  The  organization  therefore  relies  upon  manual  systems,  and  the  storage  of \ninformation is principally in hard-copy form. As a result, it is difficult and time-consuming for staff \nto obtain or retrieve information and documents, and to carry out any form of analysis. Due to its \nmanual nature, the present information management system is also prone to inefficiency in \nperforming job functions, and potential loss of critical documents and information. \n \n31.  While  the  problems  and  issues  arising  from  lack  of  computerization  and  lack  of \nmanagement systems within CAAN are of concern generally, of particular concern is the lack of \nany form of accounting system within the Finance Department, or at the airports where financial \ninformation is collected. Currently, the Finance Department operates with all of its financial \ninformation held in spreadsheets. TIA\u2019s financial staff prepare spreadsheets to enable data to be \nsent to headquarters for manual entry into the accounts. Similarly, financial information collected \nfrom the regional and domestic airports is collected in manual form, and manually entered into \nspreadsheets when received at headquarters. The result of this process is that not only are \nerrors made in data entry from manual records, but also the use of spreadsheets does not allow \na high level of financial detail to be retained in the accounts. This, and the use of spreadsheets \nfor  retaining  all  of  CAAN\u2019s  financial  records,  also  prevents  any  detailed  and  sophisticated \nanalysis of CAAN\u2019s financial performance, or any in-depth analysis of particular sub-elements of \nCAAN\u2019s organization. It has been concluded that an urgent and vital requirement of capacity \nbuilding is to procure and install a proprietary accounting system within CAAN, and to set up a \nbetter system of collecting financial information from the airports and ensuring its accurate \nrepresentation in the accounts held at headquarters. \n \n32.  The proposed capacity building program has been designed to address both the lack of \nfinancial accounting systems (through procuring and installing such systems), and the need to \nput in place a computerized management information system that would transform the present \nmanual information management approach into a system in which information entry, storage, \nand retrieval of all information necessary to support CAAN\u2019s operations can be carried out \nelectronically within a networked computer system. This would enable greater management \nefficiency, easier and quicker access to information, and the ability to carry out analysis of \nCAAN\u2019s operations and performance. \n \nc.  Private Sector Participation \n \n33.  Apart from operating the air transport services, the private sector plays only a limited role \nin the operation of civil aviation in Nepal. The main area of involvement is in the provision of \nretail services in the passenger terminal buildings at the airports. It has been recognized that a \ngreater involvement of the private sector in this and other areas of civil aviation operations and \ndevelopment may be possible, and that benefits could also be derived from an expanded role. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n34.  Opportunities  for  expanding  the  private  sector  activity  and  scope  in  the  passenger \nterminal  buildings  appear  to  be  available.  At  TIA,  this  will  require  some  improvement, \nexpansion, and refurbishment of the international terminal building. Similarly, provision of a new \n(larger) temporary domestic terminal building will open up greater opportunities for private \nsector  involvement.  A  proposal  to  both  develop  the  temporary  domestic  terminal  and  to \nrefurbish  the  international  terminal  is  included  in  the  development  program  proposed  for \nimplementation under the ADB loan project. This will not only enhance the level of private sector \nbusiness at TIA and at other airports but will also benefit the traveling passengers by offering a \ngreater range of products and services for sale. This will in turn benefit CAAN by generating \nmore revenue from retail concessions. \n \n35.  Other potential private sector opportunities exist in the air cargo terminal, where little or \nno revenue is generated by CAAN. \n \n36.  In addition to provision of additional services and retailing in the passenger and cargo \nterminals, the private sector could also be involved in providing services to CAAN and to the \nairports and air navigation services authority, through an outsourcing program. This could be \napplied in some of the areas where critical staff shortages are noted, such as airport and \nequipment maintenance, thus providing a partial means of addressing the staff shortage issue. \nSimilarly, CAAN has a considerable number of airport development projects under way across \nthe country, all of which are managed by the Civil Engineering Division, with little of the work \nassigned to the private sector. Since all of the engineering disciplines, as well as architecture, \nare available locally in the private sector, there is an opportunity for CAAN to outsource a large \npart of this work to the private sector, thereby enabling its own scarce staff resources to be \nconcentrated on managing and controlling the domestic airport development projects. \n \n37.  The  involvement  of  the  private  sector  in  airport  development  is  also  under  serious \nconsideration by CAAN and the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation (MOTCA). This concerns \nthe role of the private sector in financing, developing, and operating some of the airports of \nNepal. In particular, interest has been shown by the private sector in the development of a new \ninternational airport near Simara, a new international airport at Pokhara, and upgrade of the \nairport at Bhairawa. Thus far, the MOTCA and CAAN have not developed their own framework \nfor becoming involved with the private sector in such build-operate-transfer projects, nor have \nthe implications for CAAN and its revenues been studied. \n \n38.  One possible near-term project that has also been suggested for possible private sector \ndevelopment, either entirely or though cofinancing with the private sector, is the development of \na new international terminal building for TIA. This project has been proposed in the new airport \nmaster plan, and a site designated. However, the financing of the new terminal is beyond the \ncapability  of  the  Government,  and  will  require  financing  through  direct  commercial  loans, \nmultilateral agency loans, private sector participation, or a combination of these mechanisms. At \nthe present time, however, the financial feasibility of this project is unknown, and it is therefore \nunclear whether the project could attract a private sector developer. Nor are the implications for \nCAAN of adopting a private sector partner yet understood, especially in view of the dominance \nof the passenger terminal in generating CAAN\u2019s revenues. \n \n39.  The capacity building program proposed for implementation under the ADB loan aims to \naddress the issue of private sector participation in terms of assessing the opportunities for a \ngreater private sector role in the airport businesses (passenger terminals and cargo terminal), \nand for outsourcing to the private sector those functions that could be performed by the private \nsector to the benefit of CAAN. In addition, the program has included study of the feasibility of \n ", "  Appendix 2  30 \ndeveloping the proposed new international terminal building to establish whether this project is \nfinancially  feasible,  and  under  what  terms  of  recovery,  and  to  identify  the  implications  for \nCAAN\u2019s revenues that might arise from private sector participation in this development project. \n \n3.  Institutional and Legal Enhancement \n \n40.  CAAN is currently responsible for both the regulatory functions and operation of airports \nand air navigation services. With the current volume of air traffic in Nepal, CAAN has been \nfunctioning without major problems. However, in anticipation of greater traffic, the Government \nconsiders it necessary to start preparing for the appropriate separation of functions. To facilitate \nthis, there is a need to develop a strategy, including a legal framework and implementation plan. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  31 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nTable A 3.1: Asian Development Bank Loan Projects \n  Loan/Grant Amount Approval  Completion\nProject  (currency)  (million) Date  Date \nTribhuvan International Airport Improvement Project  Loan ($)  27.0  Jan/1997  Oct/2002 \nSecond Tribhuvan International Airport Project (Second  Loan ($)  8.0  Dec/1988  Apr/1997 \nSupplementary) \nSecond Tribhuvan International Airport Project  Loan ($)  10.25  Jul/1986  Aug/1993 \n(Supplementary) \nSecond Tribhuvan International Airport Project  Loan ($)  11.0  Dec/1978  Apr/1991 \nTribhuvan International Airport  Loan ($)  10.0  Oct/1975  Apr/1986 \nAir Transport Development  Loan ($)  6.01  Dec/1969  Jun/1977 \nSource: Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal \n \nTable A3.2: Assistance from Other Sources \nSource  of    Loan/Grant  Amount  Approval\nFunds  Project  (currency)  (million)  Year \nJICA  Project for the Modernization of the Tribhuvan  Grant   1.23  1999 \nInternational Airport (Phase 1.5)  (\u00a5) \nFrench  French Seventh Protocal: Rehabilitation of Airport  Grant/Loan  2.5/13.0  1996 \nAid  Equipment for Hub and STOL Airports  (\u20a3)  (15.5) \nAustralian Air Navigation Aids Project (DVOR/DME) at  Loan  2.06  1994 \nAid  Bhattedanda, Lalitpur  (A$) \nJICA  Project for the Modernization of the Tribhuvan   Grant  3.56  1993-1996 \nInternational Airport (Phase 1)  (\u00a5)   \nAustralian Air Navigation Aids Project on Various Airports  Loan  8.91  1992 \nAid  (A$) \nFrench  French Fifth Protocal: Runway, Taxiway and  DRF  3.90  1992 \nAid  Approach Lighting System of Biratnagar Airport  (\u20a3) \nFrench  French Forth Protocal: Rehabilitation of Control  Grant Aid  15.00  1990 \nAid  Tower, DVOR/DME and Generator Installation of  (\u20a3) \nBiratnagar Airport. \nFrench  French Third Protocal: Airfield lighting, FIDS, Nav- Loan  63.00  1989 \nAid  aids Facilities, HF Communications at TIA, Lighting  (\u20a3) \nProtection, and Generator Installation at \nPhulchowki.   \nFrench  French Second Protocal: Airfield Lighting at  Loan  13.00  1984 \nAid  Nepalgunj Airport and VDF, VHF, HF Navigation  (\u20a3) \nand Met.

Design Approach \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  technical  assistance  for  Preparing  the  Civil  Aviation \nAirport Project1 includes upgrading the master plan for meeting the demands of revised air \ntraffic  to  serve  the  needs  up  to  2028.  Also  included  is  the  upgrading  of  the  essential \ncommunication, navigation, and surveillance equipment at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA). \nAdditionally, the project includes broad proposals for improving the safety of operations at three \ndomestic airports\u2014Lukla, Rara, and Simikot. The design approach in all these components is \nimproved safety. \n \n2.  As TIA at Kathmandu is the main gateway into and out of Nepal, the master plan has \nbeen based on compliance with the safety standards and recommended practices promulgated \nby the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in the various annexes to the Convention \non International Civil Aviation. As big aircraft, such as the Airbus A340-300 and Boeing B777-\n200, are regularly operating, the facility improvements are all related to the safety specifications \nfor ICAO aerodrome reference code 4E. \n \nB.  Safety Enhancement \n3.  At TIA there is nonconformance with international safety standards and recommended \npractices in ICAO Annex 14, Volume I. The proposed project/revised master plan addresses \nthese shortcomings and will significantly improve the safety of aircraft operations at TIA. \n \n4.  The major safety enhancement features are (i) the relocation of existing military and \ncivilian aircraft hangars; (ii) provision of runway end safety areas at both ends of the runway; (iii) \na runway extension; (iv) provision of approach light systems (Category I Precision Approach \nLight System for runway 02 and Abbreviated Simple Approach Light System for runway 20); (iv) \nprovision of an instrument landing system localizer for better runway center-line acquisition; (v) \nseparation of the parallel taxiway from the runway by developing a new facility 182.5 meters (m) \nfrom the runway center line; (vi) construction of a new international apron with all necessary \nsafety  clearances;  (vii)  relocation  of  the  existing  international  apron  closer  to  the  existing \ninternational terminal building for the parked aircraft to be clear of the transition surface of the \nrunway;  (viii)  upgrading  the  old  communication  navigation  surveillance  equipment  with \nrecommendations for further action to be taken by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal; (ix) \nenhancing the capacity and level of rescue and firefighting protection; and (x) relocation of some \nparts of the perimeter road, security fencing, and drains. \n \n4.  To improve the safety of aircraft operations at three domestic airports\u2014Lukla, Rara, and \nSimikot\u2014visual aids to assist in approach and landing is the common item. Additionally, it is \nconsidered necessary that the provision of other equipment such as some essential air traffic \ncontrol and meteorological equipment, and for snow removal at Simikot and Rara airports, be \ngiven priority, followed by the provision of fire extinguishers at Rara airport.

Financial Management \n1.  The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) was established in 1998 as an autonomous \ncivil aviation authority, enabled by the CAAN Act with the mandate to develop and manage \nnational civil aviation. CAAN is responsible for providing regulatory oversight of all aspects of \ncivil aviation operations in Nepal, managing the national airspace, and operating the air traffic \ncontrol  service.  CAAN  is  operating  and  maintaining  the  nation\u2019s  international  airport  in \nKathmandu, and all of the other regional and remote domestic airports and short take-off and \nlanding strips. \n \n2.  CAAN\u2019s financial requirements are planned by its finance department and submitted to \nthe CAAN board for approval on an annual basis. CAAN\u2019s internal budget preparation requires \neach department to submit its annual financial requirements covering all aspects of its planned \nactivities and development for the fiscal year. A budget committee, established within CAAN\u2019s \nCorporate  Planning  Directorate,  initially  reviews  and  approves  departmental  budgets  and \nconsolidates  these  for  submission  to  the  director  general.  Subsequently,  the  consolidated \nbudget requirement is submitted to the CAAN board and, ultimately, to the Ministry of Finance \nfor approval as part of the parliamentary budget approval process. CAAN\u2019s finance department \ncurrently does not operate with any specific accounting system and prepares its accounts using \nMicrosoft Excel. Its financial statements are prepared with the same software and in a format \nprescribed  by  the  Government's  Office  of  Auditor  General  which  audits  CAAN\u2019s  financial \nstatements annually.  \n \n3.  CAAN operates with an adequate system of financial and management accounting, \nreporting,  auditing,  and  internal  controls.  However,  efficiency  is  weak  due  to  lack  of  staff \nresources and a computerized information system. There is a need to implement an accounting \nsoftware system to integrate physical and financial planning and management systems and \nintegrated  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems  to  support  the  provision  of  timely \ninformation to management and the efficient management of resources and cash flow. The \nProject's capacity strengthening component will help address this by introducing a financial \nmanagement information system, consisting of accounting software, networked computers, and \ntraining. This will help CAAN effectively manage its financial performance and resources.  \n \n4.  For  project  implementation,  the  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  will  establish  and \nmaintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing resources received and \nexpenditures made for the Project, thus ensuring an adequate audit trail. CAAN will assign \nsuitably  qualified  accountants,  consisting  of  a  chief  project  accountant  and  an  assistant \naccountant, to the PCU for project accounting and financial management. The Government's \nOffice  of  Auditor  General  will  annually  audit  the  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements in accordance with international auditing standards. The direct payment procedure \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be utilized for substantial disbursement of payments \nfor works, goods, and consulting services. The PCU will monitor the projects, certify consultants' \nand  contractors'  invoices  and  claims,  and  submit  to  ADB  for  direct  payment.  Financial \nmanagement of ADB projects does not pass through CAAN Finance Department.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  45 \nB.  Financial Sustainability \n5.  The  proposed  investment  in  upgrading  and  expanding  the  Tribhuvan  International \nAirport will increase CAAN's revenues. A profit and loss statement has been prepared to reflect \nthe effect of the proposed investment project based on an analysis of the revenue sources for \nCAAN, and taking into account the operating, administrative, and staff expenses incurred for the \nrevenue generation resulting from implementation of the Project.

Economic Assessment \n \n1.  Introduction \n1.  The Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) is the main gateway to Nepal. Around 80% of \ntourists arrive by air through TIA on their way to other destinations within the country. Thus, TIA \nis a major contributor to the socioeconomic development of the country and needs large-scale \ninvestment to be upgraded to meet the growth of traffic. The proposed investment project has \nbeen  planned  to  significantly  improve  airport  capacity  and  boost  tourist  traffic.  TIA  is  not \ncompliant  with  many  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  safety  and  security \nstandards and recommended practices, which may affect the continued operation of larger \naircraft. Also, due to the limitations of navigational equipment and lighting, the airport operates \nwith some restrictions on night flights, which deters some foreign airlines from serving the \nairport after dark, thus limiting the possibility of developing new markets. Another constraint is \nthe presence of obstacles around the airport, which has prevented better runway utilization for \ngreater efficiency and improved capacity. \n \n2.  The sustained growth of passenger traffic requires major capacity improvements, the \nmost immediate being the operation of the airport without time restriction, and complying with \nICAO safety and security standards to ensure continued service by larger aircraft. This will \nsignificantly contribute to the development of the tourism sector and facilitate travel by Nepalese \ncitizens employed abroad, both of which are major contributors to foreign exchange earnings. \nThe tourism sector plays a large role in the economy of Nepal by contributing over 25% of the \nforeign exchange earnings from export of goods, and in terms of percentage of total foreign \nexchange earnings, the tourism sector contributes 6.6%. The tourism sector also provides direct \nor indirect employment to over 300,000 people and is a major employment provider. Nepal is a \nmajor destination for recreation, trekking, and mountaineering. Investments in the tourism sector \nhave been given high importance in successive 5-year plans with the aims of establishing Nepal \nas a premium world tourism destination, developing tourism as an important part of overall \neconomic development, and expanding tourism benefits down to the village level in the long \nterm. \n \n3.  The improvement and expansion of TIA has been the subject of numerous studies \nundertaken over the last 15 years by various agencies including the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). The ADB studies, under ADB\u2019s technical assistance for the Preparation of Civil Aviation \nSector Strategy,1 have focused on possible future ADB assistance for financing Nepal\u2019s civil \naviation sector and improvements to the airport at Kathmandu, and the report contains a civil \naviation strategy, sector management plan, and TIA infrastructure development plan, as well as \nproposals for improving some domestic airports. The current project under ADB\u2019s technical \nassistance for the Civil Aviation Airport Project2 aims to study the feasibility and viability of the \ninvestments recommended for further ADB assistance. The TIA is currently handling more than \n2.5 million passengers annually, and this is expected to grow to more than 9.0 million in 30 \nyears. The long-term development options involve a large investment which was found not \nfeasible in the short or medium term. The without-project option anticipates the likelihood of \nwithdrawal of operation of larger aircraft and this may seriously affect the air traffic in and out of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Preparing the Civil Aviation Sector Strategy. Manila (TA 4772-NEP, \nfor  $150,000, approved on 20 March). \n2  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Preparing the Civil Aviation Airport Project. Manila (TA 7031-NEP, \nfor  $750,000, approved on 14 December).  \n ", "  Appendix 10  47 \nNepal. An investment plan that will avoid this situation and will also remove the operational \nconstraints for night operation have been developed under this project as a possible viable \noption  (with-project  option)  with  an  investment  of  $70  million,  and  includes  the  minimum \nessential requirements to sustain the traffic growth in the short and medium term. \n \n4.  The proposed investment plan in the with-project option consists of major improvements \nto the runway and taxiway system and significant upgrade of navigational aids equipment. The \nairport  improvement  program  will  include  the  installation  of  equipment  that  will  enable \noperations around the clock, lifting restrictions for foreign carriers that would prefer to operate at \nnight. These airlines would rather schedule flights in a way that they can depart or arrive at their \nown hubs during the day when most flights converge to allow the interconnection of passengers. \n \n5.  In addition, the capital expenditure program will include several works that are required \nto meet international standards and recommended practices with respect to airport facilities. \nThe investment plan will assure full compliance with the ICAO's Annex 14 requirements. This \nwill improve air safety and ensure continued operation of lager aircraft essential to retaining and \nsustaining tourist traffic growth. \n \n6.  The effect of this improvement will be an increase in total passenger traffic as well as \nsignificant increase in tourist traffic, and easier access for foreign visitors. \n \n2.  Traffic Forecast \n7.  The air traffic forecast for TIA prepared in this project has been based on a forecast of \nthe gross domestic product (GDP) of the countries of nationality of visitors to Nepal. Nepal is \nmainly a tourism destination for international travelers, and the underlying assumption is that \nincreases of GDP in the countries where traffic originates (which are not necessarily the same \ncountries  from  which  people  arrive)  will  result  in  higher  disposable  income,  and  this  will \nultimately lead to a rise in demand for leisure travel. Business traffic is also driven by GDP, but \nin this case, the increased economic activity is responsible for stimulating demand. \n \n8.  Passenger traffic and aircraft movement projections are complemented with a busy day \nforecast.  This  analysis  is  used  to  determine  peak  traffic  volumes  (passengers,  aircraft \nmovements, and stand requirements for aircraft parking), and is of paramount value for planning \npurposes. \n \n9.  Considering the base scenario, without the implementation of improvement projects at \nTIA, passenger traffic is projected to grow from the current 2.5 million passengers (2007) to 5.5 \nmillion in 2018 and up to 8.9 million in 2028, while aircraft movements will rise from 77,342 in \n2007 to 133,116 in 2018, and to 181,944 in 2028. If an investment project is carried out to \nupgrade the airport at TIA, and is implemented by 2012, passenger traffic is expected to \nincrease to 5.8 million by 2018 and to 9.3 million in 2028, while aircraft movements would reach \n141,996 in 2018 and 189,595 in 2028. A summary table of the forecasts in 5-year incremental \nperiods for both international and domestic passengers and aircraft movements is given in \nTable A10.1. The table includes the forecasts developed for the two scenarios reflecting the \neffect on traffic growth of making improvements to TIA (with-project) and of not improving TIA \n(without-project). \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  48 \nTable A10.1: Summary Traffic Forecast Results Comparing With and Without \nImprovement \n \nForecast summary:  \nTotal passengers and total aircraft movement (by international/domestic, most likely scenario) \n \nItem  2008  2013  2018  2023  2028 \nA.

Further to the overall air traffic forecast given above for TIA, an incremental traffic \nestimate that is associated with the proposed project investment was prepared to analyze the \neconomic impact and feasibility of the Project. A traffic forecast developed as part of the study \ndemonstrated that, if the existing operational restrictions during night hours were removed, TIA \nwould be able to attract airlines from countries in east Asia. The convenience of direct flights \nfrom countries in east Asia will then enhance the attractiveness of Nepal as a tourist destination. \nThis is a major contributor to the additional traffic in the with-project scenario. \n \n11.  In addition to the new traffic expected to visit Nepal as a result of the installation of new \nnavigation equipment, the investments are also expected to avoid the loss of existing traffic if \ncompliance with ICAO's Annex 14 is not met. It is assumed that, without carrying out the \nnecessary works according to the safety standards and recommended practices, code E aircraft \nwould not operate at TIA. The analysis then considers that a significant portion of that traffic will \nbe lost, consisting of tourists arriving on medium- and long-haul flights who will be dissuaded \nfrom taking intermediate connecting flights to reach Kathmandu. \n \n12.  The passenger traffic (arriving and departing) that is likely to be lost if code E category \naircrafts cannot be operated is estimated at 730,290 in 2013, which will increase to 1.25 million \nby 2023. The additional tourist arrivals, in addition to normal growth, with night operation are \nestimated at 132,300 passengers. \n ", "  Appendix 10  49 \n \n3.  Costs \n13.  The financial costs of the Project consist of all incremental capital expenditure. The \nincremental operation and maintenance costs of the project facilities were estimated on the \nbasis of cost parameters developed by the consultant. The Project\u2019s economic costs include the \nresource costs for traded and nontraded costs, materials, and labor. All imported cost elements \nare valued at border prices. Locally sourced inputs are valued with all taxes and duties excluded \nto calculate economic prices. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.7 was used for unskilled labor, to \naccount for the opportunity cost of the unskilled labor cost component. \n \n4.  Benefits \n14.  Economic benefits are derived from the additional air traffic generated/retained as a \nresult of the Project. The airport improvement program will include the installation of equipment \nthat will enable operations around the clock, lifting restrictions for foreign carriers that would \nprefer to operate at night. The resulting effect of this improvement will be increased total \npassenger traffic, improving the access for foreign visitors. \n \n15.  In addition, the capital expenditure program will include several works that are required \nby the international standards and recommended practices with respect to airport facilities. The \ninvestment plan will assure full compliance with ICAO's Annex 14 requirements. The analysis \nassumes  that,  without  compliance  with  ICAO  standards,  the  airport  would  no  longer  be \noperational for  code  E  aircraft,  leading  to  a significant  traffic  reduction.  Consequently,  the \nimplementation of the safety-related works will imply a substantial benefit derived from the \nProject by preventing the loss of traffic that is now retained. \n \n16.  The economic analysis considers that the results in the with-project scenario achieve \nboth benefits. The new investments will bring additional traffic from night operations and will \nallow the airport to retain traffic by preventing the withdrawal of operators on safety grounds. \nThe new stimulated air traffic will be mostly comprised of foreign visitors, representing a benefit \nto the economy through the additional export of tourist services, consisting of spending on \ngoods and services such as lodging, food, arts and crafts, and related tourist services. From \nthese new passengers, there will be an increase in airport revenues, associated with the fees \nand charges levied on additional flights and passengers, as well as from additional commercial \nrevenues at the airport outlets. \n \n17.  The Project is expected to generate several types of economic benefits: an increase in \ntourist spending derived from additional tourist arrivals (gained from both night operations and \nthose retained with improvements in the safety conditions) and additional aeronautical and \ncommercial revenues received by the airport from this induced new traffic. For the economic \nevaluation, the benefits of the Project have been calculated from airport operations, such as \nlanding charges, passenger facility charges, and other fees and charges for airport services for \nthe net additional passenger traffic and net revenue/profit from additional tourists. Gross tourist \nspending (estimated at $63 per person per day in 2008) was netted for the production cost of \ngoods and services sold to tourists, estimated to be 71%, and the remaining constitutes an \neconomic  benefit.  The  net  tourist  benefit  was  estimated  for  the  additional  tourists  for  the \naverage duration of stay (estimated to be 10 days) and included in the benefit stream and \naccounting for 52.8% of the total benefits estimated. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  50 \n5.  Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n18.  The cost and benefit streams have been estimated for a 20-year period including the 3-\nyear implementation period. The residual value after 20 years is assumed to be zero. All costs \nand benefits used for the analysis are in nominal 2009 values. The economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) for the proposed project investment is estimated at 21.1%.

A sensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible unfavorable scenarios resulting from \nchanges in the key parameters that determine the Project\u2019s costs and benefits. This analysis \nindicates that the Project\u2019s economic viability would remain satisfactory even under adverse \nscenarios. A risk analysis was also undertaken to estimate the limits under which the project \nEIRR would fall below the opportunity cost of capital. Based on the analysis, it was estimated \nthat it would require a cost increase of 61% or a decrease in benefits of 34% to reach a cut-off \nEIRR of 12%, giving high confidence in the economic viability of the Project.

Financial Assessment \n \n20.  Financial analysis has been carried out to assess the viability of the proposed project \ninvestment based on the capacity of TIA to generate sufficient incremental revenues with project \nimplementation to cover the capital costs of the Project. The analysis was carried out on an \nincremental basis using the discounted cash flow methodology, and measuring the internal rate \nof return of the project. The analysis is based on the following assumptions: \n(i)  Capital costs are based on the proposed capital expenditure plan for FY2011 \nthrough FY2013 for the proposed investment program and are estimated at $70 \nmillion.  \n(ii)  The revenue stream considered for the analysis was derived by calculating the \ndifference between the revenues collected by the airport in the with-project and \nwithout-project scenarios. The additional revenue due to the project is derived \nfrom the following: \n(a)  Additional traffic gained from new markets, through the ability to operate \nnight flights (with the implementation of new equipment).  \n(b)  The retention of traffic (i.e., traffic not lost) due to compliance with safety \nstandards. The implementation of improvements will avoid losing traffic \nfrom aircraft that would not be able to operate without the airport being in \ncompliance with ICAO\u2019s Annex 14. For this purpose, it has been assumed \nthat the airport would not be able to operate ICAO code E aircraft any \nlonger if standards are not met.  \n(iii)  The financial projections of revenue and operating expenditures are based on \nactual  revenues  and  operating  expenditures  for  the  airport  for  FY2007  and \nFY2008. \n(iv)  Capital  costs  are  based  on  the  proposed  capital  expenditure  plan  for  2011 \nthrough 2013. \n ", "  Appendix 10  52 \n(v)  Financial projections are based on the air traffic forecasts. \n(vi)  Future staff requirements are based on the current organizational structure with \nadjustments to meet the requirements of the new development. \n(vii)  All financial projections are shown in 2008 nominal dollars with no adjustment for \ninflation. \n(viii)  The revenue and cost streams are compared for a 20-year period. \n \n21.  A discount rate of 12% was used as a benchmark rate to compare the return. The \naverage cost of capital to the CAAN for the project investment is estimated at 8.25%, which is \nthe minimum requirement as set out in ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Financial Governance and \nManagement of Investment Projects Financed by ADB.3 The FIRR estimated for the proposed \nproject investment for the most likely traffic scenario is 14.0%, which is above the benchmark \nrates and thus indicates that the proposed investment is financially viable.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nOne of the priority areas of Nepal is poverty reduction. Nepal\u2019s 11th Interim Plan (2007\u20132010)a has been formulated \naccording the Millennium Development Goal targets. Removal of various exclusionary factors, whether social or physical, is \nalso considered important by the Government. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has also emphasized poverty reduction in \nNepal through development of basic infrastructure such as roads, airports, and irrigation. The country partnership strategy \nresults framework in the ADB Nepal country operations business plan (2008\u20132010)b includes enhanced air transport services \nthrough additional domestic airports among the indicators of improved connectivity of different parts of the country, particularly \nof rural areas.  \n \nCivil aviation is essential for Nepal, especially in remote areas that are otherwise inaccessible by road. Through safe and \nreliable air transport services, rural people will have better access to basic services, such as health care. This in turn could \npromote  inclusive  social  development  by  providing  access  to  various  rural  and  poor  communities  who  are  currently \ngeographically excluded. Improved air transport services could also contribute to economic development in the less-\ndeveloped regions of the country, and help improve the country's business environment. Potential tourism activities may \nflourish in these remote areas through this Project, and this could promote the development of local businesses and \nemployment opportunities. Through ADB's assistance, the institutional capacity of the civil aviation sector will be improved \nalongside the improvement of air transport facilities. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \nThis project  will aid poverty reduction by improving transportation facilities and thus (i) reduce exclusions based on \nremoteness or geography, (ii) reduce transportation costs and increase reliability, (iii) reduce the prices of goods and \ncommodities, and (iv) increase income opportunities for local people. As the airports in the mountain areas are made safe and \nreliable through the project, the cost of operation for the airlines is expected to fall. It is expected that even the price of food \nwill be reduced because of this. At present, food is very expensive in Mugu, Humla, and Solukhumbu districts, where project \nwork is located, and Mugu and Humla districts face food shortages from time to time. Reliable air service will also enhance \ntourism, as these districts have potential for tourism. The trekking tourism that is promoted because of the Project will help in \ndeveloping small business opportunities and other employment opportunities for poor people such as porters. Local farmers \ncan also sell their products such as milk, vegetables, and fruits. The improvement of Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) will \nincrease tourism and the benefits will trickle down to poor people through creation of business and employment opportunities. \n \n2.

Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nA socioeconomic survey covering 17% of the 300 households in the project-influenced area and four public consultations and \ntwo focus group discussions were conducted to gather feedback from the local communities on the proposed development \nand perceived socioeconomic impacts. The survey revealed that the primary beneficiaries of the airports in remote areas are \nthe people who are geographically excluded and who have no access to road transport. The air services are also not regular \nin these places because of the low standard of the airports, which brings many risks in traveling. Therefore, primary \nbeneficiaries are the people in remote areas. They will benefit from reduced prices in transportation and through reduced \nprices of goods and commodities. Women, the sick, and the elderly will also benefit as they can avail themselves of air \ntransport in case of emergency.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  55 \nThe other benefits will come indirectly through promotion of tourism and opportunities to expand business, however small they \nmay be, because of tourism. Employment opportunities in tourism will be enhanced. People\u2019s income will increase as they \ncan sell their products to tourists. The impact zone in TIA is also relatively poor compared to other parts of Kathmandu. The \nopportunities to expand business will enhance the incomes of people in this zone.  \n \nMost of the impact zones (such as Humla, Mugu, and Solukhumbu) are located in the poorest and most remote areas of the \ncountry, which occasionally face food deficits and food deprivation. These are also the poorest districts in the country in terms \nof Human Development Index and other development indicators. Poverty rates in these districts are 42% in Humla, 51% in \nMugu, and 46% in Solukhumbu; the national poverty rate is about 31%. Conditions in the immediate impact zones are slightly \nbetter, because they are located in district headquarters where people have greater opportunities. Despite this, the poverty \nrate in the immediate impact zone could be as high as 15%, compared with 4.4% in Kathmandu overall.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nA socioeconomic survey covering 17% of the 300 households in the project-influenced area, and four public consultations and \ntwo focus group discussions were conducted in June 2009 to gather feedback from the local communities on the proposed \ndevelopment and perceived socioeconomic impacts. These discussions were held with men, women, farmers, high-income \ngroups, poor people, community leaders, teachers, and government officials to ensure a comprehensive perspective was \ngained on the Project as well as its impacts. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making      Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes     No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nAll the activities of the Project will be confined within the airport boundary and there will be no interference at the community \nlevel. The C&P plan was prepared to inform and collate public views on the proposed development project. \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Project will have no interference at the community level because it is confined within the airport boundary. The \nconstruction of buildings, hangars, parking space, and taxiways will be done within the present airport boundary without \nencroaching upon private land and property. However, gender participation was ensured during the course of the social study \nby undertaking a process of gender analysis so as to assess the possible impact of the proposed Project on Women. Two \nfocus group discussions were undertaken with women belonging to different socioeconomic groups, such as high-income, the \npoor, and households headed by women. These discussions revealed that the majority of the women felt the Project will \nbenefit them as there will be employment opportunities for the civil work, and opportunities for business such as establishing \ntea shops and restaurants to cater to the construction workers. The study also revealed that women in the project-influenced \narea were mainly involved in household chores, wage work at home (like woolen threadmaking for the nearby factories), in \nbusiness and shops (like working in these enterprises), and in vegetable and dairy farming. There are few women engaged as \nteachers, Government officials, and nongovernment organization employees. Women\u2019s groups were also formed and these \ngroups ran adult literacy classes in the ward office in the community.  \n \n2.
