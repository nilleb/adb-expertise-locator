Technical assistance (TA) to increase ownership of and effective demand for improved \nwaste management in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) will help determine the viability \nof a proposed loan to improve management and disposal of urban solid waste. The TA will be \nfinanced by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. Country consultation missions in 2004 \nand 2005 recommended the inclusion of the proposed TA grant in ADB\u2019s program1 and it was \nincluded in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) nonlending program for the RMI in 2005.2 ADB \nand  the  Government  have  reached  an  understanding  on  the  objectives,  scope,  and \nimplementation of the TA.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.    Urban  waste  management  poses  serious  human,  environmental,  and  economic \nchallenges, especially for an atoll environment. The lack of ownership of and effective demand \nfor the disposal and management of solid waste on the increasingly urbanized atolls of the RMI \nis degrading the natural environment, poisoning scarce groundwater resources and fragile \nisland environments, creating health hazards, and eroding subsistence and formal economies \n(including fisheries and tourism). No sustainable solution has so far been established for urban \nwaste management in the RMI. The poorest of the poor, who do not have land titles, are most \naffected. The problem is becoming severe as 70% of RMI\u2019s population now lives on the two \nurban atolls of Ebeye and Majuro. Most of these people originate from the outer islands, having \nbeen permitted to build houses and to establish residence by land owners (the irioj) and land \nmanagers (the alap). The land owners tend not to help with any improvements to tenanted \nlands, yet most residents do not consider waste disposal to be their responsibility, but rather \nthe concern of the few land owners and land managers.  \n \n3.  Urban solid waste in RMI is mostly generated from residential and commercial sources, \nand municipal services such as street cleaning. The current practice on Majuro is that all waste \nis dumped into 15 cubic yard or 20 cubic yard garbage bins provided at several locations by the \nMajuro Atoll Government (MALGOV). The outcome of a waste stream survey at Jenrok village \nin Majuro3 estimated current waste production at 1.06 pounds (lb)/person/day, or around 2 \ntons/day (720 tons/year) for the village, which has a population of about 1,800. According to the \nsurvey, half of the waste materials were organic matter, with the rest mostly diapers, plastics, \ncardboard boxes, aluminum cans, tin cans, fabric, glass, and foam. The urban solid waste in \nMajuro is currently disposed of in a landfill on reclaimed land. However, the retaining wall of the \ndisposal site has been broken by waves and there is now a risk of coastal pollution. There is no \norganized waste recycling program. A report of the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning \nCoordination under the Office of the President (OEPPC) suggests that an integrated solid waste \ncollection  and  disposal  system,  including  composting,  recycling,  and  incineration  of  waste \nmaterials should be established to minimize the waste that goes to the disposal site, thereby \nextending the life of the site.  \n \n4.  Currently, four agencies are involved in urban waste management on Majuro: MALGOV \nfor the collection of solid waste; the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) for the construction, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 14 October 2004.  \n2  The TA concept paper was approved by the Vice President (Operations 2), on 7 June 2005. \n3 The waste stream survey was undertaken by the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning Coordination \n(EPPC),under the International Water Program (IWP), funded by Global Environmental Facility and the United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP), and managed by South Pacific Regional Environmental Programme in \npartnership with OEPPC. \n ", "2   \nmaintenance and management of the disposal site; the RMI Environment Protection Authority \n(RMIEPA) for monitoring the discharge of waste at the dumpsite; and the Marshall Islands \nVisitor\u2019s Authority (MIVA) for public awareness raising. The overall management of urban solid \nwaste  is  inefficient,  and  coordination  needs  much  strengthening.  In  addition  to  the  four \nagencies,  there  are  other  stakeholders  concerned  with  solid  waste  management  in  RMI, \nincluding communities, businesses, traditional leaders, and landowners. Solid waste has been \na perennial problem, and the government recognizes the need to strengthen the coordination of \nsolid waste management. Therefore, the Cabinet approved the formation of a Solid Waste Task \nForce on 20 December 2004, replacing the informal Solid Waste Committee. The task force is \nco-chaired by the mayor of MALGOV and the chief secretary. Its other members consist of the \nsecretary of public works; the directors of the economic, policy planning, and statistical office \n(EPPSO), RMIEPA, and MIVA; the commissioner of public safety; and a representative of the \nMajuro Chamber of Commerce. The task force meets regularly. A bill was introduced in 2004 to \nestablish  a  single  authority,  the  Marshall  Islands  Solid  Waste  Management  Authority \n(MISWMA), but passage of the bill was suspended.   \n \n5.  Urban waste management in RMI has been top-down and supply-driven, with agencies \nproviding overall support facilities. It is also highly subsidized, but little attention has been paid \nto  public  awareness,  ownership  of,  and  demand  for  continued  and  sustainable  waste \nmanagement.  During  the  preparations  for  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  updates \n(CSPUs) for 2003 to 2004, it was agreed that improved urban waste management should be \nthe top priority for future ADB lending. An ADB loan can provide the finance, technology, and \ntraining for a further supply-driven solution to urban waste disposal, but the project will not be \nsustainable if there is no solid ownership of or effective demand for a waste management \nsystem. Participatory processes will help to establish ownership and demand and also help \ndirect  the  design  of  the  proposed  ADB-financed  project  preparatory  TA  (PPTA).  The  TA \ndiscussed in this paper will support a series of informed and facilitated participatory planning \nexercises that will bring all relevant stakeholders (households and businesses that generate \nwaste, agencies responsible for waste management, and people who are affected) to discuss \nthe current status and trends, principles and issues, and to design solutions to improve urban \nwaste management, for subsequent funding by ADB or other donors and the Government.  \n \n6.  Addressing environmental problems and their impact on living conditions and public \nhealth standards, particularly for the urban poor, is a priority in ADB\u2019s country strategy and \nprogram  for  RMI.  This  TA  will  involve  all  stakeholders  in  creating  effective  demand  and \ninstitutional support for better urban waste management. Participatory processes are now an \nintegral  feature  of  ADB\u2019s  program  in  RMI,  and  there  is  political  support  for  community \nparticipation in government affairs. Government initiatives that have been directed at tackling \nsolid waste problems, such as establishing SWTF and drafting the bill to establish MISWMA, \nshow the government\u2019s commitment to addressing solid waste management, and this TA is \nconsidered a high government priority.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The ultimate outcome of the TA will be sustainable urban waste management and \nenvironmental improvement in RMI. The TA will (i) promote public awareness and ownership of \nurban  waste  management  through  extensive  informed  participatory  planning  processes, \n(ii) improve  institutional  arrangements  for  urban  waste  management,  and  (iii)  design  a \nsustainable solution to urban waste management. It will lead to a community-designed and \n ", "  3\ncommunity-owned waste management system established by the Government and assisted by \nADB and/or other international financial institutions.  \n \n8.  The  key  TA  outcomes  will  be  (i)  greater  community  awareness  of  urban  waste \nmanagement  through  educational  materials,  including  videos,  radio  programs,  drama,  and \narticles;  (ii)  more  participation  by  communities,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs), \ngovernment agencies, and other stakeholders in urban waste management; (iii) a stronger \ninstitutional framework for urban waste management; (iv) stakeholder recommendations and \ncommunity  design of urban waste management; (v) pilot activities to test the participatory \napproach to establishing an urban waste management system; and (vi) recommendations for \nthe proposed PPTA on urban waste management in RMI. The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  TA  scope  and  key  activities  will  include  community  awareness  activities  and \nextensive consultation with stakeholders on formulating the urban waste management system. \nA detailed methodology will be provided to the consultants. Key activities will include:   \n \n(i)   undertaking  extensive  stakeholder  consultations  on  the  TA  objectives  and \nprogram,  assessing  the  current  involvement  of  women  in  community-based \ndecision-making processes and structures for urban waste management, and \nintroducing best practices of information dissemination to establish a sustainable \nurban waste management system; \n(ii)   assessing the institutional framework for solid waste management (analyzing \ncurrent institutions, and assessing whether new institution(s) should be formed \nor existing institutions reformed), and reviewing relationships between central \ngovernment, municipal government, and civil society; \n(iii)   strengthening  local  capacities  for  continued  participation  in  improved \nenvironmental management and delivery of other public services; \n(iv)   initiating design of an urban waste management system (characterized by its \ngender-inclusiveness and responsiveness, and by private sector participation) \nand  further  institutional  development  in  support  of  improved  urban  waste \nmanagement (the design will feed into the forthcoming PPTA on urban waste \nmanagement); and \n(v)   providing guidance for the replication of best practices from the pilot case study \nto other areas outside Majuro, and RMI municipalities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $375,000 equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of \n$197,000  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $178,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  $300,000 \nequivalent to finance the foreign exchange cost ($197,000) and $103,000 of the local currency \ncost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund,4 and \nadministered by ADB. The Government will contribute $75,000 equivalent through the provision \nof counterpart staff, office space, administrative services, and data. Cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n4  The TA was endorsed by Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund on 25 May 2005. \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the TA will be MALGOV, in coordination with the MPW, \nRMIEPA, and MIVA. The Government has assured ADB that suitably qualified counterpart staff \nwill be assigned to the TA, and that it will provide secretarial and administrative support, and \nadequate office space. A TA steering committee will be established to provide multisectoral \nguidance  during  TA  implementation.5  The  steering  committee  will  meet  to  discuss  the \nimplementation plan, midterm report, draft final report, and other issues that arise during TA \nimplementation. Stakeholders will be actively involved in the TA through individual contacts and \nstakeholder workshops during TA implementation. Terms of reference for the consultants and \nthe proposed work schedule are in Appendix 3.  \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 8 months, beginning in October 2005, with \ncompletion expected in May 2006. The TA will finance the services of one participatory planning \nprocesses specialist with knowledge of environmental management (5 person-months), and one \nurban waste management specialist (1 person-month). A domestic consultant with expertise in \ncommunity  development  and  knowledge  of  environmental  management  will  help  the \ninternational consultant in overall implementation of the TA (7 person-months). An independent \ndomestic consultant will be engaged intermittently during TA implementation to independently \nmonitor the activities and TA progress (total 1.6 person-months). ADB will recruit the individual \nconsultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of domestic consultants. Equipment will be \nprocured under arrangements satisfactory to ADB.6 The consultants will submit five copies of all \nreports to ADB and MALGOV. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n13.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to the Government of \nthe Marshall Islands to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund \nfor Increasing Ownership of and Effective Demand for Improved Urban Waste Management, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.   \n \n                                                 \n5  The steering committee representing key stakeholders will be established during the inception phase of the TA. \n6  The consultants will assist in the procurement of the equipment with prior concurrence from ADB. The equipment \nwill be transferred to the Government after completion of the technical assistance.  \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Source/Reporting  and Risks \n  Mechanisms    \nImpact       \nIncreased ownership and  Increased involvement  Report and minutes of   \neffective demand for  of relevant stakeholders  meetings of the \nimproved urban waste  in urban waste  Government\u2019s Solid \nmanagement.   management through  Waste Task Force \n  their participation in  (SWTF). \nwaste collection and \npayment for disposal \nevident by May 2006. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nCreate effective demand  Increased community  Report and minutes of  \u2022 The government and the \nand institutional support  involvement in urban  meetings of the SWTF,  traditional hierarchy \nfor better urban waste  waste management by  project reports,  systems support the \nmanagement:  May 2006.  consultants\u2019 progress  participatory processes. \n\u2022  enhanced community    reports, report of  \u2022 All relevant stakeholders \nawareness and  Relevant stakeholders  independent domestic  actively participate in the \ncapacity for  recommend the means  consultant, and Asian  exercise and the facilitated \nparticipatory process;   to improved urban waste  Development Bank  discussions can lead to \n\u2022  improved institutional  management and   (ADB) review missions.  better understanding of  \narrangements.  its institutional    the need for participation.  \n  arrangements by May    \u2022 All participants support the \n2006.    new mechanisms.  \n.    \nOutputs      Assumptions \n(i)  Guidelines on  Production of the  Project reports,  \u2022 Republic of the Marshall \nparticipatory processes in  guidelines by December  consultants\u2019 progress  Islands (RMI) domestic \nformulation of urban  2005.   reports (inception,  media production can \nwaste management.    midterm, and final),  produce material that will \n    report of independent  support intended output of \n(ii) Pilot activities to  Pilot activities  domestic consultant,  the exercise. \ndemonstrate the  established in suitable  facilitator reports, and   \nparticipatory approach to  village(s) and able to  ADB review missions.  \u2022 Marshallese society \nestablish urban waste  reflect an urban waste    supports participatory \nmanagement system.  management system.    processes, hence there is \n      active participation of all \n(iii)  Stakeholder design  A recommendation on    stakeholders in the \nof urban waste  urban waste    technical assistance (TA) \nmanagement systems  management systems    implementation, including \nand pilot institution that  and pilot institutional    the pilot activities, and in \nwill strengthen ownership  framework for urban    designing the urban waste \nand demand for improved  waste management by    management system.  \nurban waste  May 2006.      \nmanagement.        \n       \n(iv) Educational materials  The production of media     \n(videos, radio programs,  material by December     \ndrama, articles) to  2005.     \nenhance community       \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n       \n  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Source/Reporting  and Risks \n  Mechanisms    \nawareness of urban       \nwaste management.        \n       \n(v)  Recommendations for  Recommendations for     \nthe proposed project  the proposed PPTA by     \npreparatory technical  May 2006.      \nassistance (PPTA) on       \nurban waste       \nmanagement in RMI.        \n       \n(vi) Capacity of Majuro  On the job training of     \nAtoll Municipality, Ministry  civil servants and     \nof Public Works, and  nongovernment     \nother related agencies to  organization personnel     \nuse participatory  by May 2006.     \nprocesses strengthened.       \n       \n(vii) Presentation of the  Presentation to Cabinet  Cabinet Memo.
