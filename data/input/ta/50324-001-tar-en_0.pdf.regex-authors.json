INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports developing member countries (DMCs) to \nachieve development results through three interlinked assistance levels: country, sector or theme, \nand project. At the country and sector levels, ADB integrates results frameworks in country \npartnership strategies to help ensure that country operations achieve the intended development \noutcomes. Sectors and themes have operational plans containing results frameworks that set out \ndesired achievements across DMCs. At the project level, ADB uses the design and monitoring \nframework (DMF) to assist DMCs\u2014particularly executing and implementing agencies of ADB-\nsupported projects\u2014in results-based project design and management. ADB also measures its \ncorporate performance through its annual development effectiveness reviews (DEfRs), which \nreport  achievements  and  identify  weaknesses  in  ADB\u2019s  operational  and  organizational \nmanagement. \n \n2.  ADB needs to continue to improve its results delivery.1 The proposed technical assistance \n(TA) will (i) establish a holistic approach to results-based project design training in DMCs, \nincluding face-to-face training sessions and online learning modules; (ii) support operational \nresearch  in  issues  that  affect  the  delivery  of  desired  project  outputs  and  outcomes;  (iii) \ndisseminate lessons that can be used to improve project design and delivery; (iv) expand efforts \nto capture the transformation that ADB operations produce at the beneficiary level; and (v) support \ncollaborative work with other multilateral development banks (MDBs), including on benchmarking \nthe performance of MDBs through the Common Performance Assessment System report.2 \n \n3.  ADB approved a concept paper for this TA on 20 October 2016 as part of the 2017 TA \nprogram.3 This TA\u2019s outputs are in the management-approved 2017 work program of the Strategy, \nPolicy and Review Department (SPD), and the TA is in the 2017 work plan of the SPD\u2019s Results \nManagement and Aid Effectiveness Division (SPRA). The DMF is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  While ADB operations have benefited from the use of results-based approaches, the \nannual DEfRs still show recurring problem areas that need attention and corrective actions. The \n2016 DEfR noted that while the success rate of sovereign operations improved considerably, it \nremains below the 2016 target of 80%, and the success rates of nonsovereign operations remain \nstagnant. And while the delivery of gender equality results through completed operations is strong, \ngender mainstreaming at approval has declined since 2014. Other key indicators of inclusiveness \nin design also show weaknesses, including social protection operations supported through the \nAsian Development Fund and infrastructure operations targeting lagging areas. \n \n5.  Operations fall short of expectations because of challenges at various stages in the project \ncycle. Starting from the project design stage, the project DMF should clearly present the results \nchain and identify plausible risks. The quality of DMFs and their link to the problem tree and the \nrationale could be further strengthened. Part of the challenge can be traced to weak ownership \nby DMC staff on the project design, owing to a lack of experience and familiarity with the results \nchain. The issue is further compounded by turnover in executing agencies and implementing \nagencies without adequate handover. To address the problem, ADB must periodically build the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Enhancing Results Delivery in Operations.

Common Performance Assessment System\u2014COMPAS. \nhttp://www.mfdr.org/Compas/index.html \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 June 2017. \n ", "2 \ncapacity of executing and implementing agency staff on sound, results-based project design. \nTraining provided to DMC staff under previous TA projects directly responded to demand from \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies,  which  was  communicated  through  ADB\u2019s  regional \ndepartments and resident missions. This demand has grown in recent times, and additional efforts \nare required to respond to it. \n \n6.  During 2015\u20132016, ADB conducted the first in a series of operational research studies. \nThis first study concentrated on the sustainability of ADB\u2019s road transport and water operations, \nwhich previous DEfRs had identified as a key challenge. The study identified good practices and \nlessons learned from a sample of ongoing and completed ADB projects to help determine long-\nterm sustainability. ADB circulated a draft of the study for comments during 2016 and is expected \nto publish the study in 2017.4 Other smaller studies conducted as part of the operational research \nincluded an analysis of (i) factors affecting projects and the results-based lending disbursement \nratio, and (ii) key factors affecting contract awards; the analysis identified important lessons for \nADB and DMCs. The initial studies covered a portion of a broader set of challenges that \ndevelopment projects face. To improve results delivery of operations, ADB must undertake \nadditional research and look at issues affecting ADB\u2019s completed operations. It can also learn \nfrom the experience of comparable organizations. The World Bank, for example, has invested \nsignificant resources to develop a taxonomy of development challenges under its Global Delivery \nInitiative (GDI), of which ADB is a member.5 Operations research, including greater alignment \nwith the GDI, can help ADB and DMCs improve learning from projects and incorporate lessons \nlearned into design and implementation, thus improving success rates. Case studies based on \nADB operations can also help DMCs learn from ADB\u2019s experience and improve their own projects. \n \n7.  Understanding and communicating the effect ADB operations have on the individual lives \nof beneficiaries is a crucial part of enhancing development efforts in DMCs. Greater awareness \nby all stakeholders of the difference that ADB projects make builds support for development in \nDMCs and the wider global community. In addition, this knowledge can further improve design \nand delivery through the learning process. Together We Deliver (TWD), a collection of individual \nstories of people\u2019s lives changed by successful projects, demonstrates the benefits that ADB \nprojects bring.6 ADB\u2019s stakeholder representatives and donors have endorsed the presentation \nof these human stories, have communicated strong demand for such products, and are supportive \nof expanding coverage of more areas of ADB\u2019s operational and strategic priorities. However, the \nlearning  element  of  this  publication  could  be  strengthened  by  documenting  the  lives  of \nbeneficiaries before and after projects. In addition, the coverage could be deepened to increase \nawareness of the benefits of projects of different types across the range of sectors, themes, and \npartnerships. The sustainability of benefits also needs to be explored.  \n \n8.  To sustain achievements under previous TA projects, it is crucial to provide additional \nresources to replicate capacity building and outreach on a wider scale (footnote 1). Under the \nproposed TA, ADB will (i) extend project DMF training to more DMCs, (ii) expand its operational \nresearch, and (iii) expand and enhance the production of human stories linked to operations. \n \n                                                \n4  ADB.

The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  effective  and  sustainable  delivery  of \ndevelopment results in DMCs increased. The TA will have the following outcome: quality of project \ndesign and implementation improved. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n10.  Output 1: Capacity in preparing design and monitoring frameworks developed. The \nproposed TA will establish a holistic approach to DMF training. The training program will include \ntwo components: (i) face-to-face training sessions, and (ii) online learning modules. Classroom-\nbased training can effectively catalyze the use of results-based thinking. The courses will provide \nparticipants from executing and implementing agencies (at least 50% of whom are female staff \nmembers of the agencies) with practical applications of the results chain under ADB\u2019s various \nlending  modalities,  including  policy-based  lending,  results-based  lending,  and  multitranche \nfinancing facilities. Crosscutting issues such as gender equality, governance, climate change \nadaptation, and inclusiveness will be key features of the training program. To overcome logistical \nand resource constraints and reach out to more participants, ADB will develop online learning \ncourses  that  cater  to  different  knowledge  levels,  which  will  provide  on-demand  learning \nopportunities. ADB will develop the modules in collaboration with the Sustainable Development \nand Climate Change Department, Knowledge Sharing and Services Center (SDCC-KS). \n \n11.  Output 2: Lessons from operations documented and disseminated. The proposed \nTA will continue to support operational research started under previous small-scale TA projects. \nThe studies will research issues affecting operations, which were determined in part by the DEfR \nfindings. This will include research on topics suggested by ADB\u2019s regional departments and sector \nand thematic groups, such as the use of ADB projects as pilots for replication by DMCs, and the \nlessons on creating and sharing knowledge through ADB projects. Research will also cover \ninclusiveness dimensions of ADB operations such as gender equality and other topics; and will \nbuild on other ADB studies, reviews of operational plans, and lessons from evaluations by the \nIndependent Evaluation Department. SPRA will collaborate with ADB\u2019s operations departments, \nsector and thematic groups, and SDCC-KS; and will consult with ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation \nDepartment to identify delivery and results achievement challenges that would benefit from \nresearch and learning. SPRA will collaborate with development partners such as the Korea \nDevelopment Institute and Shanghai International Program for Development Evaluation Training, \nwhile ADB will increase alignment with the World Bank\u2019s GDI. ADB will complete a series of \noperations research studies and will synthesize and share the knowledge gained from these \nstudies across ADB and with DMC partners, using appropriate channels. Linkages with respect \nto data mining, for example, will include collaboration with ADB\u2019s Operations Services and \nFinancial Management Department and Office of Information Systems and Technology, among \nothers. \n \n12.  Output 3: Developing member country experiences documented and disseminated. \nThe proposed TA will support the production of at least two issues of results stories that feature \nthe positive changes brought about by ADB operations in DMCs. These stories will include \ninclusiveness dimensions of operations. In particular, the gender aspects of operations will be \ncaptured by a systematic collection of information on gender-differential outcome results at the \ndata collection stage and highlighted in the stories. Greater linkage to ADB\u2019s efforts in impact \nevaluation will also be sought, and pre- and post- data collection will be undertaken by embedding \n ", "4 \nTWD in the design process of operations prior to approval. This will be done in collaboration with \nADB\u2019s  operations  departments,  sector  and  thematic  groups,  and  Economic  Research  and \nRegional Coordination Department. In collaboration with its Department of External Relations, \nADB will also consider producing associated multimedia content for TWD, which may include \ninteractive media, virtual reality content, online articles, and social media posts. \n \n13.  Output  4:  Multilateral  development  bank  performance  benchmarked  and \ndisseminated. The proposed TA will support collaborative work with MDBs, with emphasis on \nbenchmarking performance and using evidence-based approaches to measure performance. In \n2017, ADB took over the secretariat and coordination functions of the MDB Managing for \nDevelopment Results working group. ADB will lead the preparation of the Common Performance \nAssessment System report, which benchmarks members\u2019 progress in achieving development \nresults (footnote 2). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. The TA will cover the travel cost of ADB staff acting as resource persons for \nseminars and workshops. \n \n15.  The governments of participating DMCs will make relevant country data available; will \nnominate participants to join training courses and meetings related to this TA; will validate TA \ndeliverables, such as country and progress reports; and may provide in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. SPD will administer and implement the TA \nfrom September 2017 to March 2020 and will closely coordinate implementation with ADB\u2019s \noperational departments, sector and thematic groups, SDCC-KS, and other departments. The TA \nwill (i) support the development of DMF learning modules, help deliver online and face-to-face \ntraining, and build capacity in results-based project design; (ii) support operations research to \nprobe issues that constrain the effectiveness of ADB projects and disseminate findings to improve \nproject design; (iii) document and disseminate the changes contributed by ADB operations to \npeople\u2019s lives; and (iv) support the benchmarking and dissemination of MDB performance. \n \n17.  The TA will disseminate knowledge through various platforms. To ensure continuous \nlearning on DMF principles, online courses will be developed to supplement the on-site training \nconducted by DMF resource persons. These courses may be hosted on existing ADB platforms \nfor online learning to ensure that they remain accessible even after the TA closes. For operational \nresearch products and TWD, in collaboration with the Department of External Relations, the \noutputs will be disseminated through various channels, depending on the target audience. All \noutputs will be made available to the public for free through ADB\u2019s corporate website. Limited \ncopies will be produced for general dissemination and targeted workshops in headquarters, \nrepresentative offices, and resident missions. \n \n18.  The TA will require 100 person-months of consulting services comprising 38 person-\nmonths for international consultants and 62 person-months for national consultants. The TA will \nrequire consultant inputs to prepare and deliver a DMF training program, including online training \nmodules. Researchers and data analysts will conduct operations research, and writers will draft \n ", "5 \nthe manuscripts for various knowledge products. The TA will also recruit resource persons and/or \nexperts to support the training program and outreach activities. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  September 2017\u2013March 2020 \nExecuting agency  ADB\u2019s Strategy, Policy, and Review Department in \ncollaboration with operations, advisory, and knowledge \ndepartments \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual consultants  100 person-months  $460,000 \nselection \nProcurement  To be procured by ADB \nNot applicable \nAdvance contracting and retroactive  Not applicable \nfinancing \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time) \nAsset turnover or disposal arrangement  Not applicable \nupon TA completion \nADB= Asian Development Bank, TA= technical assistance. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n19.

To  continue  accessibility  of  the  learning  courses  beyond  the  TA \ncompletion date, SPRA will explore hosting the proposed e-learning courses within the learning \nmanagement  system  maintained  by  SDCC-KS.  ADB  makes  learning  courses  on  select \ndevelopment topics available to external participants on its k-Learn and Development Asia \nwebsites. The sites provide online courses on various sector and thematic areas as part of ADB\u2019s \nwork to share knowledge in the region. SPD will work with SDCC-KS\u2019s team of e-learning \nspecialists to update and manage the content of the courses. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nEnhancing Operational Results Delivery, and hereby reports this action to the Board.\n                                                \n7  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \n \nEffective and sustainable delivery of development results in DMCs increaseda \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting   Risks \nOutcome  By 2021     \nQuality of project  a.
