The  Government  of  India  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) to mainstream public-private partnerships at the state level.  \nThe TA Fact-Finding Mission1 visited India from 31 August to 3 September 2006 to ascertain the \ncontext, scope, and direction of the proposed TA and to consult on the specifications as well as \nTA measures and costs related to its components. The Government has concurred with the \nproject impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, \nand terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Background. India has achieved impressive growth rates of 7%\u20138% in the last 3 years, \nbut is now increasingly running into infrastructure constraints. Indeed, it has been said that \u201cpoor \ninfrastructure is India\u2019s Achilles heel,\u201d and weak infrastructure is costing India about 3%\u20134% \npoints of lost gross domestic product (GDP) a year. India\u2019s Planning Commission estimates that \nIndia needs to enhance its spending on infrastructure from 6% to 9% of GDP. ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy for India shares this assessment and emphasis.  \n \n3.  Infrastructure,  as  a  public  good,  is  an  important  determinant  of  productivity, \ndevelopment, and poverty reduction. Higher income levels and growth lead to further demands \nfor transport, telecommunications, and energy services. In general, an incomplete infrastructure \nnetwork limits the ability of some areas to participate in economic growth. Insufficient capacity \nacross infrastructure sectors also leads to a widening infrastructure gap resulting in lower \nproductivity, higher transport and logistics costs, reduced competitiveness, and slower growth. \nTo improve infrastructure facilities, however, public financing alone\u2014constrained as it is by the \ndeficit reduction provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2004\u2014will \nnot be able to generate the needed levels of investments.3 It has been reported that of the total \ninvestments of $425 billion needed in infrastructure until 2010\u20132011, there is a financing gap of \n$123 billion.4 The private sector, thus, needs to be encouraged to participate in infrastructure \nimprovements. As a matter of fact, the World Bank estimates that if private investments in \ninfrastructure were to rise 3% of GDP (from an average of 1% in the past 10 years), India would \nget about $20 billion a year for investments. \n \n4.  However, while most infrastructure projects have high economic justification, they are \nnot able to meet the financial return threshold that would readily attract private investment, \nparticularly in the weaker states of India. Also, the hesitation of private investment flows to \ninfrastructure in India, as in many developing countries, has to do with the absence of a sound \nlegal and policy environment, and other prerequisites for private sector participation. As such, \nmuch as the private sector could be encouraged to try to meet the financing gap, only a closer \npartnership  between  the  public  and  private  sectors  can  support  sustainable  development, \nreduce poverty, promote equity, and ultimately achieve greater prosperity. \n \n                                                 \n1 The Mission comprised Gambhir Bhatta, Senior Governance Specialist, SAGF/SARD, Mission Leader; Pratima \nDayal, Senior Economist (Regional Cooperation), INRM; and Shunso Tsukada, Principal Transport Specialist, \nINRM. Mr. T. Kondo, Country Director, INRM, provided valuable advice to the Mission. This advisory technical \nassistance also benefits from the discussions at the recent series of  regional  workshops on public-private \npartnership (PPP) held in cities of India. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 6 September 2006. \n3  The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act requires the Government to reduce fiscal deficit by a \nminimum of 0.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) every year and revenue deficit by 0.5% each year, so that the \nfiscal deficit is not more than 3% of GDP by March-end 2009. \n4  World Bank. 2006. India: Addressing Constraints to Infrastructure Financing. Washington, DC. \n ", "2   \n5.  Government Strategy and Actions. The Government is fully aware of the potential that \na partnership with the private sector can bring to the infrastructure sector. While it has had \npolicies in favor of attracting private participation in the infrastructure sector when economic \nreforms were introduced in 1991, it is only in the last decade that it has made known its \npreference for public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) to be the mode for financing infrastructure at \ncentral, state, and even substate levels. This has been done so as to use budgetary resources \nto maximize efficiency and leverage the large pool of private capital as well as introduce private \nsector-based efficiencies and management enhancement.  \n \n6.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  and  policies  to  attract  private  participation  in  the \ninfrastructure sector have until recently focused largely on power and telecommunications. It is \nnow increasingly expanding to other sectors and to instituting appropriate regulatory structures. \nA significant policy move now evident is related to the nature of competition and risk sharing. \nThe initial efforts at this were weak in a competitive sense (e.g., contracts were awarded \nthrough  memoranda  of  understanding  rather  than  through  competitive  bidding,  and \ntelecommunication licenses were awarded through bidding but the number of players was \nrestricted). However, starting with telecom, the Government changed the licensing regime, and \nalso  increased  the  level  of  competition  by  allowing  free  entry  in  wireline  telephony.  The \nGovernment has now expanded its engagement in PPPs and included areas such as roads, \nports, airports, and urban infrastructure. \n \n7.  Some recent specific steps taken by the Government to encourage PPPs include (i) \nestablishing a PPP cell in the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) in the Ministry of Finance; \nthe Government is also guiding state governments to establish PPP cells for mainstreaming \nPPPs; (ii) setting up the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) to facilitate \naccess to long-term resources for infrastructure development;5 (iii) creating a Viability Gap Fund \nwith a current annual allocation of approximately $340 million to promote PPPs;6 (iv) forming an \ninter-ministerial group to determine pre-qualification of bidders under PPP to avoid fly-by-night \noperators; and (v) preparing PPP tool kits and model concession agreements by DEA for use by \nvarious state governments. \n \n8.  Continuing Constraints. With respect to these recent measures, the Government itself \nconcedes that even an optimistic assumption of a total of 500 PPP projects across India is \u201cnot \nvery encouraging.\u201d7 Despite a long experience with PPPs in infrastructure, the realization of the \npotential for infrastructure development through PPPs at the state level remains rather limited \nand few states have the capacity to establish a viable PPP framework and develop a pipeline of \nprojects. While some PPPs have been in evidence and many different approaches have been \nfollowed,8 it is clear that the enabling legal, policy, and regulatory frameworks remain either \nunderdeveloped, or not conducive, or weakly applied. The fiscal position of most of the states is \n                                                 \n5  India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) has paid-up capital of approximately $2.27 million and \nauthorized capital of about $227 million. Apart from its equity, IIFCL will be funded through long-term debt for which \nthe Government may extend a guarantee for repayment of principal and interest. The extent of guarantee provided \nin the first year of operations is expected to be around $2.2 billion. \n6  The Fund can provide catalytic grant assistance of up to 20% of the capital costs, through which it expects several \nprojects to become bankable, attract private capital, and mobilize private sector efficiencies. It is estimated that if \nthe entire Viability Gap Fund were utilized, it would lead to investments of $1.6 billion annually at minimum \nleverage. \n7  Report of the Regional Workshop of Chief Secretaries on PPP, Bangalore, 12 June 2006. In the regional \nworkshops of chief secretaries on PPP, this point was reformulated to the issue of \u201cproject pipeline creation\u201d so that \nthere are sustained opportunities for PPPs in the infrastructure sector. \n8  However, most of the state initiatives are restricted to road projects, real estate development, industrial parks, and \nrelatively minor projects, such as bus terminals on a build-operate-transfer basis. There is also considerable \nvariance among the states in India not only on the use of PPPs, but also its very meaning. Thus, there is a need to \ninstitute some discipline in the application of the PPP methodology across central and state-level entities. ", "  3\nalso such that without private sector participation, the status of infrastructure would not change \nsubstantially even over the medium term. \n \n9.  Moreover, the low level of operational efficiency hampers the effectiveness of existing \ninfrastructure facilities. Very little capacity at the state, district, and municipal levels to attract \nprivate sector interest in developing and financing infrastructure projects remains a binding \nconstraint. Few governments have the fiscal strength to undertake PPP on a performance-\npayment  basis,  and  except  for  the  states  with  specific  infrastructure  project  development \ncompanies (as in Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Punjab), there is little institutional capacity for \nprofessional project preparation. Also missing is a dynamic database at the center and states \nthat allows rigorous monitoring of ongoing PPP projects. \n \n10.  A recent World Bank study on PPPs in India9 concluded that to ensure successful PPPs, \ngovernments must develop and strengthen capacities to, inter alia, (i) appraise costs and risks \nbeing borne by government, (ii) bring to bear transactions skills to the market, and (iii) originate \nand financially close PPP deals. The report also stated that \u201cstrengthening capacities \u2026 to \nconceptualize,  structure,  and  manage  PPPs  will  lead  to  more  and  better  PPPs.\u201d  The \nGovernment accepts this conclusion, and in response to its request, this TA has been proposed. \nPrior assistance to Government in this area has been on supporting private sector participation \nin specific subsectors;10 ADB's assistance through this TA is useful to directly contribute to \ntapping into financing opportunities that exist for infrastructure improvements. As such, this \nsupport is seen by Government as being highly catalytic. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The proposed TA will support the Government in mainstreaming PPPs at the central and \nstate  levels  through  capacity  enhancement/development  as  required.  It  will  also  support \neffective institutionalization of the PPP cells to deliver their mandate. The impact of the TA will \nbe  in  evidence  not  only  in  improved  access  to  basic  infrastructure  services,  but  also  in \nincreased efficiency in infrastructure service provision. The TA will leverage and mobilize the \nexisting resource base in the Government for supporting PPPs in infrastructure, use public and \npotential private resources for infrastructure development and maintenance, and help ensure \ngreater impact in infrastructure development at the state and national levels.  \n \n12.  The outcomes of the TA will include  (i) capacity development in the PPP cell within DEA \nto help implement PPP schemes effectively and efficiently; (ii) enhanced capacity of PPP cells \nin  participating  entities  to  prepare,  evaluate,  and  appraise  PPPs  in  infrastructure;  (iii) \nsignificantly improved monitoring of overall progress in PPPs in infrastructure at both central \nand state levels through well-knit databases; (iv) increased awareness among potential private \nsector  partners  about the  project cycle  of  PPP  projects  in  infrastructure,  and  Government  \nexpectations  with respect to value for money; and (v) over the long term, an increase in private \nsector participation in infrastructure development and management throughout India.  \n \n                                                 \n9  World Bank. 2005.

Support under this project will be (i) part of the larger Government agenda on economic \nreforms and institutional development by focusing on a key sector (i.e., infrastructure); (ii) needs \ndriven  (the  TA  has  been  formulated  based  on  needs  specified  by  the  union  and  state \ngovernments); (iii) targeted and value added by focusing on relevant capacity development and \ncreating  an  enabling  framework  for  PPPs  in  DEA  and  other  entities;  and  (iv)  focused  on \nselected states and entities (in a ramped up manner over 3 years) where the scope for using \nPPPs will have significant impact on the development of critical infrastructure. \n \n14.  The TA will have two components: (i) capacity development, and (ii) institutionalization of \nPPP  skills.  The  first  component,  capacity  development  for  the  PPP  cells,  includes  (i) \ndetermining training needs; (ii) developing relevant management information systems (MIS); (iii) \ndeveloping  guidelines  and  manuals;  (iv)  support  for  project  preparation,  appraisal,  and \nevaluation; and (v) knowledge dissemination and awareness of international best practices.11 \nThis support will proceed in tandem with review of constraints of the existing frameworks for \ninfrastructure development; review and finalization of eligibility criteria; and development of \nnecessary policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms in the infrastructure sector. \n \n15.  As follow up to the capacity development support, the second component will assist PPP \ncells in selected entities to institutionalize their skills through practical application of the enabling \nframework. There will also be assistance to the PPP cell at DEA to coordinate the process and \nto do further needs assessments. This component includes (i) refining the PPP policy and \nregulatory framework,12 (ii) meeting compliance/public safety norms, (iii) improving MIS, (iv) \nimproving bidding documents and procedures, (v) determining risk sharing, (vi) conducting \nvalue-added research/analysis, and (vii) determining adequate monitoring arrangements. \n \n16.  Key activities will include (i) conducting a baseline survey of the regulatory environments \nfor infrastructure; (ii) monitoring progress of PPP projects in infrastructure by creating a MIS to \nupdate project indicators and track performance; (iii) developing capacity within PPP cells at \nDEA and elsewhere;13 (iv) assisting in promoting PPPs in infrastructure through appropriate \noutreach  to  potential  private  sector  partners;  and  (v)  increasing  awareness  among  these \npartners about their role in PPP, increasing overall understanding of the PPP project cycle, etc.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $3.75 million equivalent, of which ADB will finance $3 \nmillion equivalent on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund ($1.8 million) and ADB\u2019s \ntechnical assistance funding program ($1.2 million). The Government will provide $750,000 \nequivalent  to  finance  the  local  currency  cost  to  cover  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities, \n                                                 \n11 Dissemination will also take the form of road shows that will help showcase the PPP experiences of the selected \nprojects. Workshops/seminars will be conducted, and capacity development support will include undertaking \npartnership development missions to countries that have successfully practiced PPPs in the infrastructure sector. \nCross learning among the states will also be encouraged. \n12 The legal and regulatory changes that are needed in order to promote PPPs are on: (a) concession contracts, (b) \nfinancing, such as through special purpose vehicles, (c) competition, and (d) regulatory risks that could prove to be \ndisincentives to the private sector to participate in PPPs in the infrastructure sector.  \n13 The training and capacity building activities here include (i) enhancing the understanding of the rationale for PPP \nprojects; (ii) how to use risk assessment models and develop options for appropriate risk-sharing schemes; (iii) \nhow to effectively use tools for assessing value for money like public sector comparator (i.e., what the government \nwould have to pay if it undertook the project itself); (iv) understanding the structure and regulatory implications of \nconcession contracts; (v) how to manage a bid process to maximize competition, and address issues relating to \ncompetition and regulation in infrastructure; (vi) how to appraise PPP projects; and (vii) how to evaluate contingent \nliabilities incurred as part of PPP projects.

Implementation Arrangements \n18.  DEA will be the executing agency for the TA, which will be implemented by the PPP cell \nof DEA and the participating entities. A steering committee for the Project, to be chaired by a \njoint secretary at DEA, will be established and will have representatives of the participating PPP \ncells as well as one person from the private sector to be selected by DEA. The steering \ncommittee will meet at least once every 6 months, and is mandated to provide policy oversight \nto\u2014and monitor and guide the implementation of\u2014the Project, and resolve issues that may \narise in its implementation. \n \n19.  The entities selected for TA support are as follows: (i) DEA at the central level, and (ii) \nPPP  cells  in  14  states.14 To  achieve  project  outcomes,  1,230  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services (Appendix 3) will be provided15 to selected entities at the central and state \nlevels by (i) one PPP expert (on an individual basis) focusing on project financial analysis and \nrisk  management,  (ii)  one  MIS  expert  (on  an  individual  basis)  focusing  on  information \nmanagement, and (iii) a panel of three legal firms on retainer basis (expected input: intermittent \nover the year but approximately 6\u20137 months throughout the year) to provide legal expertise on \nPPPs. There will also be two financial specialists (72 person-months) and one public finance \nexpert (36 person-months) to be based at DEA. Selection of the individuals and the firms will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006 as amended from \ntime to time). Recruitment of consultants will be done by a committee of representatives from \nADB, the Government, and the participating entity. \n \n20.  The Government and participating state governments will provide office space, furniture, \nlogistical, and all administrative support necessary to implement the project. Office equipment \nand materials to be financed by the TA will be procured using the shopping method, and in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006 and as amended from time to time). \nAt the end of the TA, the procured equipment will belong to the relevant government agency \nusing it. TA implementation will last 36 months, from January 2007 to December 2009. \n \n21.  The steering committee will disseminate the results of the project, and project evaluation \nresults will be made publicly available on the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n22.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 on a grant basis to the Government of India for \nMainstreaming Public-Private Partnerships at State Level. \n                                                 \n14  The  14  states  identified  are  Andhra  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  Jharkand,  Karnataka,  Kerala,  Madhya  Pradesh, \nMaharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. \n15 The selection method, terms of reference, and reporting/coordinating arrangements for the consultants are detailed \nin Appendix 3.
