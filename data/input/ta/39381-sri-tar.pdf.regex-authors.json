In September 1997, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Second Perennial \nCrop Development Project (SPCDP),1 which supported the development of perennial crops in \nSri  Lanka  by  ensuring  sustainable  credit  facilities  and  effective  extension  services.  The \nGovernment requested a follow-on project with more focus on marketing and value addition to \nbuild  on  the  successful  implementation  of  SPCDP.  In  response,  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA)2 for the Agribusiness Development Project (ADP) was included in the \ncountry strategy and program update 2006\u20132008 for Sri Lanka (2005).3 The TA Fact-Finding \nMission visited Sri Lanka in January 2006, and reached an understanding with the Government \non the objectives, scope, financing, and implementation arrangements for the TA. The TA is \ndesigned to build on ADB\u2019s earlier assistance, lessons learned, and support provided under \nSPCDP. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.        The agriculture sector accounts for about 17% of Sri Lanka\u2019s gross domestic product and \nabout  32%  of  employment.  Within  the  agriculture  sector,  the  three  leading  categories  of \nproduction are paddy, plantation crops, and other. The \u201cother\u201d category, which accounts for 47% \nof  the  production,  includes  fruits  and  vegetables,  subsidiary  field  crops,  spices,  animal \nhusbandry, medicinal herbs, and floriculture.4 The agro-industrial sector comprises four main \ncategories: food and other, liquor, beverages, and tobacco products. Food processing is by far \nthe largest, generating 60\u201365% of the value of the sector\u2019s production. While the agro-industrial \nsector  contributes  nearly  25%  of  the  value  of  industrial  production,  agro-industrial  exports \naccounted for only about 4% of industrial exports in 2004. This implies that the domestic market \nconsumes  a  major  proportion  of  agro-industrial  goods.  Sri  Lanka  has  a  wide  range  of \ntopography and climate, which offers a unique opportunity for growing many high-value crops\u2014\nand, therefore, for agribusiness activities. Since the late 1990s, however, the agribusiness \nsector has not realized its growth potential.  \n   \n3.  Lack of Effective Enabling Environment. Consultations with the private sector suggest \nthat  a  major  constraint  to  commercialization  of  agriculture  is  the  lack  of  an  enabling \nenvironment, caused mainly by erratic agricultural policies and priorities, market imperfections, \nand inappropriate technology. The agriculture sector is central to the development policy of the \nnew Government, which focuses on guaranteeing food security through paddy production, and \nrecognizing the potential for diversification and commercialization of agriculture. Since 1996, the \nGovernment has adopted several policies to assist the growth of the agriculture sector by \nshifting from low-value to high-value production, and by improving productivity and international \ncompetitiveness. However, some policies were drafted but not approved, while others did not \nsupport the Government\u2019s attempt to diversify agriculture. Constraints for the sector are the (i) \nrestrictive land policies,5 (ii) inconsistent trade policies, (iii) restrictive quarantine regulations, \nand (iv) commodity price interventions. The Government took steps to liberalize the land market \nby transferring land titles to farmers, and by gradually replacing the deed registration system \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Second Perennial Crop Development Project. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 January 2006. \n3  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Sri Lanka. Manila.   \n4  For the purpose of this project, agribusiness will include only commercial-scale production of fruits, vegetables, \nspices, animal husbandry, medicinal herbs, and floriculture. \n5  Most of the land provided to farmers in settlement schemes is on tenure systems that restrict sale and the use of \nthe land as collateral for loans. \n ", "2   \nwith a system of title registration.6 In 2000, the Agrarian Services Development Act No. 46 \nallowed farmers to grow alternative crops on paddy land with prior approval, although the \nburdensome process still tends to prevent farmers from diversifying.  \n \n4.  Since becoming a founding member of the World Trade Organization in 1995, Sri Lanka \nhas set tariffs on most agricultural goods at a uniform rate of 50%, and has freed all food \nimports of import licenses.7 However, the Government frequently adjusted import duties in an \nattempt to achieve the conflicting objectives of ensuring low food prices for consumers and high \ncommodity prices for producers. This created a climate of uncertainty among agro-processors. \nIn addition, the Plant Protection Act and National Seed Act are seen as major obstacles to free \naccess to good seeds of improved varieties and other planting material, prerequisites for a \nsuccessful agribusiness sector. The private sector, which participates in the market for imported \nseed, is able to sell seed, except for the paddy sector. However, the Government continues to \noperate a large network of commercial seed farms, which are underutilized due to the limited \nresources available for timely distribution of the seeds to the farmers. \n \n5.       The  civil  conflict  and  the  frequent  changes  in  Government  policies  have  slowed \neconomic  and  social  reforms,  undermining  the  investment  climate.  Policy  uncertainty,  as \nreflected by the lack of consistent policies, appears to be a major barrier to the entry of new \nprivate  sector  investors.  The  Government  has  implemented  some  important  measures  to \nimprove the policy and tax environment for private sector development in agriculture. As a \nresult, the private sector\u2014large as well as small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and \ntrade associations\u2014is increasingly important as a service provider in the agribusiness sector.  \n \n6.     The  use  of  modern  technology  is  not  widespread  in  Sri  Lanka,  preventing  the \nimprovement  of  quality  and  productivity. 8  Historically,  most  technologies  developed  in \nGovernment departments have not been integrated into the value chain, while public-private \npartnerships have been successful in developing needs-based technology. Furthermore, the \nlack of supportive infrastructure for marketing produce, including storage facilities, marketing \ncenters, roads, and appropriate transport, hinders the development of the sector. Post-harvest \nlosses due to improper handling, packaging, storage, and transport practices are estimated at \nabout 25\u201340% for perishable items. Poor understanding of proper produce handling, inadequate \nfinancing for storage and transport, and lack of consumer awareness of quality standards \nhamper improvements.  \n \n7.     Actors.  About 71% of farmers operate on less than 1 hectare. Thus, very small-scale \nproducers, often with only home gardens, dominate commercial production. Almost all perennial \ncrops are rain-fed, which leads to strong seasonality and large fluctuations in yields. During the \nseason, a glut of produce results in low returns and high waste. Out of season, meanwhile, \nbuyers cannot find sufficient quantities to meet orders, compelling processors to import raw \nmaterials. Production suffers from limited varieties, poor quality and appearance of produce, \nand the lack of marketable volumes of consistent quantity and quality. The sector also is unable \nto attract the younger generation, resulting in a labor shortage. The increase in the cost of \ninputs has combined with the labor shortage to drive up production costs. The majority of youth \nmigrate to urban centers in search of higher income and more socially accepted jobs. The \nyounger  generation  is willing  to  engage  in  agribusiness  activities when  new  technology is \n                                                 \n6  This will create a market for land and enable access to agricultural credit, allowing land consolidation. As a result, \nland fragmentation will be reduced, a major obstacle for the commercialization of agriculture. \n7   Except for import of seeds and planting materials. \n8  Productivity of spices, fruits, and vegetables is very low by world standards, and few crops are internationally \ncompetitive. \n ", "3 \n     \nintroduced and higher profits are obtained. A significant number of SMEs are engaged in food \nprocessing, though few are export-oriented due to their lack of competitiveness and access to \nforeign markets. Small- and medium-scale processors have scope for expansion, if efficient \ncollection and marketing networks are developed.  \n \n8.       Lack  of  Supply  Chain  Management.  The  core  problem  is  the  general  failure  in \ncoordinating the decisions of the private stakeholders (farmers, traders, and agro-processors) \nand service providers from the public and private sectors. Farmers are unable to make joint \ndecisions regarding investment, production, and marketing due to their failure to establish links \nthrough effective producer organizations. Further, farmers have weak links with (i) enterprises, \n(ii)  markets,  (iii)  research,  and  (iv)  extension providers.  The  lack  of cost-effective  contract \nenforcement mechanisms discourages vertical integration between the agro-entrepreneurs and \nprimary producers.9 Contract farming has been used in Sri Lanka mainly for paddy. Recently, \nhowever, the use of forward sales contracting has been expanded to some commercial crops to \nprovide the necessary backward and forward market links for profitable smallholder production. \nFarmers fail to link to markets because of limited access to relevant market information and \ninadequate  market  infrastructure.  Due  to  the  limited  number  of  organized  retail  chains, \nentrepreneurs are also far from consumers. Moreover, the absence of proper certification, \nquality  assurance  systems,  and  infrastructure  limits  the  integration  of  production  with \ninternational markets. \n \n9.  Lack of Market-Oriented Support Services. The supporting industries\u2014suppliers of \ninputs, research and extension services, collectors and distributors, wholesalers and retailers, \nand  credit  services\u2014are  production-oriented,  inadequately  user-driven,  and  lacking  proper \ntechnology. Agricultural research in the past has strongly favored paddy and has been driven by \nthe interests of the researchers, resulting in weak links between researchers and commercial \nfarmers. Public sector extension services often are unable to provide effective services due to \nlack of funding, bureaucratic hurdles, and inadequate client orientation.10 The result is the \nabsence of demand-driven research and extension systems, and the inadequate response to \nthe  technology  and  knowledge  needs  of  commercially  oriented  farmers.  This  has  stopped \nfarmers from diversifying into high-value production. While service providers from the private \nsector are emerging, they are oriented to the needs of corporate clients, rather than SMEs. As a \npilot activity under the SPCDP, extension responsibilities were transferred to the private sector. \nThis process has demonstrated that private sector service providers are more successful when \nthey have a stake in the production cycle. \n \n10.  Access to credit is not a key constraint for most of the medium- and large-scale agro-\nindustries. However, it is still a problem for many of the smaller agro-industries. Strict lending \ncriteria,  lack  of  suitable  collateral,  limited  borrowing  track  record,  and  lack  of  capacity  in \npreparing the business plans that banks require impair the creditworthiness of many small agro-\nentrepreneurs. Most banks still view agribusiness as a risky subsector, and do not have the \ncapacity to identify agribusiness lending opportunities, or to appraise and monitor agribusiness \nloans. Therefore, the growth of agribusiness SMEs requires alternative sources of capital from \nthe banking system.  \n \n                                                 \n9  Many agro-processors purchase raw materials from the spot market, because the quality of farm produce varies \nconsiderably. \n10 The public extension system has been weakened by its devolution to the provincial councils, and the subsequent \nlack of coordination with research that still remains a function of the central Government. The confusion between \ncentral and provincial responsibilities has resulted in weak coordination among the state institutions involved in the \nsector. \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  design  an  agribusiness  development  project  to \naddress fundamental problems in the sector. The outcome of the TA is the feasibility study that \nwill  (i)  assess  in  detail  the  constraints  and  the  impediments  to  the  development  of  the \nagribusiness sector in Sri Lanka, (ii) propose strategies for overcoming the constraints that have \nbeen prioritized by the sector stakeholders, and (iii) recommend design and the implementation \narrangements for the ensuing project. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. The first phase (3.5 months) will involve a \ndetailed  assessment  of  the  agribusiness  sector  to  identify  its  strengths,  weaknesses, \nopportunities, and threats. The assessment will include a review of (i) the policies affecting the \nsector;  (ii)  the  factor  conditions  (infrastructure,  labor,  knowledge),  actors  (inputs  suppliers, \nfarmers, traders, processors, service providers, exporters), and their links to determine the \nperformance of the supply chains; (iii) the role of relevant institutions, including the private \nsector,  in  supplying  agricultural  inputs,  production,  and  marketing  to  determine  their \neffectiveness and responsiveness to industry needs; (iv) the availability and efficiency of related \nand  supporting  services  for  agribusiness  (finance,  transport,  marketing  services,  quality \nstandards, and certification); and (v) the market demand and potential for different commodities \nto compete in the domestic and international markets, based on the concept of competitive \nadvantage. Close attention will be paid to identifying market failures that need to be addressed \nthrough public investment, private sector participation, and public-private partnerships. This \naspect will focus on marketing, market information, and processing. Based on the findings, the \nsecond phase (2.5 months) will involve formulation of a project for agribusiness development, \nemphasizing marketing and value addition of agricultural products. The project will not be limited \nto specific subsectors, though the TA will identify the crops with highest domestic market \ndemand and export potential. The creation of high-value production clusters by region will be \nconsidered to facilitate marketing and processing of value-added products. The TA also will \nidentify areas where the capacity of the public and private sector needs strengthening to support \nservices for agribusiness development.  \n \n13.   For the project to establish effective agribusiness systems by the private sector, with \nsupport from the Government, a new way of thinking and strategies for overcoming significant \ncoordination  failures  are  needed.  This  will  require  the  creation  of  appropriate  institutional \nmechanisms.  The  project  will  be  designed  to  provide  maximum  benefit  to  small-scale \nagribusinesses. However, this will be possible only by improving the performance of the entire \nvalue chain. Therefore, the project must facilitate the establishment of links among farmers and \ntheir organized groups, research departments and certification agencies, processors, traders, \nexporters, entrepreneurs, and other decision makers. ADB is funding a TA to prepare the \nSecond SME Sector Development Program (SMESDP II), which aims to design a project to \nnurture an enabling environment for SME formation, including in the agribusiness sector.11 The \nTA for ADP will use the strategic recommendations and framework set up by the SMESDP II to \nenhance the productivity, innovation, and marketing capabilities of agribusiness SMEs. \n                                                 \n11 An international post-harvest and agribusiness development specialist and a national agricultural marketing \nspecialist are part of the SMESDP II team. \n \n ", "5 \n     \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide $800,000 \nequivalent. The Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, will provide a grant to \nfinance the TA. The Government will finance the remaining cost of $200,000 equivalent by \nproviding  office  and  equipment,  counterpart  staff,  transport,  other  facilities,  and  other \nadministrative expenses. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any future project. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Agricultural Development (MOAD) will be the Executing Agency for the \nTA. Given the emphasis on coordination between ministries and private sector involvement, the \nTA will identify suitable institutional arrangements to involve other related ministries and the \nprivate sector in the implementation of the project. The TA will be implemented over 6 months, \nfrom July 2006 to December 2006. The TA will require 60 person-months of consulting services, \nincluding 27 person-months of international consultants and 33 person-months of domestic \nconsultants. The consultants will be recruited through a consulting firm or a consortium of firms, \nselected using the simplified technical proposal of ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedure. The  draft  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the consultants  is  in  Appendix  4.  The \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of \ndomestic consultants. The TA also will provide an additional 5 person-months of short-term \nassignments for experts drawn from local industry, as needed. \n \n16.  The consultants will produce (i) an inception report within 2 weeks; (ii) an interim report \nat the end of 3 months; (iii) a draft final report at the end of 5 months; and (iv) a final report at \nthe end of 6 months, incorporating feedback and comments on the draft report from ADB, the \nGovernment, and sector stakeholders. Tripartite meetings involving ADB, the Government, and \nthe  TA  consultants  will  be  held  after  submission  of  each  report.  The  feasibility  study  will \nencourage the participation of stakeholders at each level, enabling them to be involved in the \nproblem analysis, priority setting, approach, and implementation arrangements. The consultants \nwill travel extensively in the field to allow consultations with all sector stakeholders through \nparticipatory workshops organized and carried out with the support of a professional facilitator.   \n \n17.  In  support  of  the  TA  activities,  MOAD  will  provide  (i)  furnished  office  space  with \nequipment and communication facilities, (ii) vehicles, and (iii) meeting facilities and assistance \nduring stakeholder consultations and/or workshops. The Government will provide counterpart \nstaff, including a full-time project director for the TA. The TA will provide some equipment that \nthe consultants will purchase in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Equipment to \nbe procured under the TA will be handed over to MOAD upon TA completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof Sri Lanka to be financed on a grant basis for preparing the Agribusiness Development \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact (of the      Assumptions \nResulting Loan)      \u2022  International demand \nIncreased income and  Income of households  Project monitoring and  and prices for processed \nemployment of rural  involved in agribusiness  impact assessment  agribusiness products \nhouseholds in the  increased by 10% by  surveys  hold \nproject area  2015    \u2022  Peace process \n    Central Bank of Sri Lanka  continues \nEmployment in agro- annual reports   \nindustries increased by  Risk \n10% by 2015  \u2022  Natural disasters \n \nOutcome (of the      Assumptions \nResulting Loan)      \u2022  An enabling policy, legal, \nOrganized and  Post-harvest losses for  Annual reports of the  and regulatory \ncompetitive   fruits and vegetables  Ministry of Agriculture  environment established \nagribusiness sector  reduced below 30% by  Development  for private sector \n  2012    involvement in the \n  Monitoring reports of the  agribusiness sector \nIncrease in the area for  Department of Agriculture  \u2022  Adequate investments \nhigh-value crops from    made in supporting \n17.6% to 25% by 2012  Project impact assessment  infrastructure  \n  surveys   \nIncrease in the share of    Risks \nagribusiness products    \u2022  Farm subsidies and \nin total agricultural  Government price \noutput from 47% to  stabilization policies \n60% by 2012  distort farmers\u2019 \n  investment decisions \nIncrease in the share of  \u2022  Government research \nagricultural products in  and extension services \ntotal manufacturing  cannot adapt to the \nexports from 2% to  needs of commercial \n10% by 2012  farmers \nOutput (of the TA)a      Assumptions \nFeasibility study and  Phase 1: Data  TA reports, including:  \u2022  Government approves \ndesign of a project that  collected, analyzed,  \u2022  Survey reports  TA without delay \nis suitable for external  participatory planning  \u2022  Consultation reports  \u2022  Consultants engaged \nfinancing  concluded, and initial  \u2022  Interview reports  without delay \n  project design prepared  \u2022  Poverty assessment  \u2022  All sector stakeholders \n  \u2022  Environmental  actively participate in \nPhase 2: Project  assessment  data collection, analysis, \nfeasibility study and  \u2022  Proceedings of the  and planning  \ndesign finalized  stakeholders  \u2022  Agreement on project \n  workshops  components and \n  approaches reached \nbetween stakeholders, \nbetween public and \nprivate sector, and \nbetween Government \nand ADB  \n       \n ", "  Appendix 1      7 \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.1 Submit inception report within 2 weeks of TA commencement  \u2022  ADB: $800,000 \n1.2 Hold tripartite meeting involving the Government, ADB, and the TA  \u2022  Government: $200,000 \nconsultants to discuss the inception report  \u2022  27  person-months  of \n1.3 Assess the agribusiness sector:  international  consultants \n(i)  Review the policies affecting the sector;

Links to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a    Yes  Is  the  sector  identified  as  a   Yes \nnational  priority  in  country    national  priority  in  country   \npoverty analysis?        No  poverty partnership agreement?     No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in Sri Lanka: \n \nAbout 80% of the population lives in the rural areas. Agricultural productivity per worker is \nstagnant,  and  many  workers  are  moving  out  of  the  agriculture  sector.  The  lack  of  young \nproductivity growth has a serious long-term impact on the ability of the agriculture sector to \nprovide for an expanding rural population. The agriculture sector has to grow at about four times \nthe current rate of 1.4% to absorb increases in the rural population. Without such an acceleration \nin growth, poverty will increase. \n \nAgricultural  households\u2014those  that  cultivate  crops,  raise  livestock,  or  engage  in  casual \nagricultural  wage  employment\u2014account  for  about  45%  of  the  poorest  rural  households \n(excluding those in the estate sector). Higher-value crops account for a small percentage of the \noutput  of  these  households.  For  many  crops,  the  average  yields  are  much  lower  than  in \nneighboring countries.  Given the large proportion of poorer families dependent on agriculture, \nincreasing agricultural productivity, improving crop varieties and rural infrastructure, reducing \npost-harvest losses (30\u201340% of the output of fruits and vegetables is lost before reaching the \nmarket), and adopting a strategy of marketing and value addition can contribute significantly to \npoverty reduction in rural Sri Lanka. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nAbout 23% of the population of Sri Lanka lives below the official national poverty line ($180 per \nyear, 2002, defined as real annual per capita total food and nonfood consumption expenditure). \nApproximately 90% of those below the poverty line live in rural areas. Agriculture-based income \nfor  the  poorest  agricultural  households,  those  in  the  lowest  expenditure  quintile,  is  divided \nequally between wages from casual labor and from own-farm activities. Without rapid increases \nin agribusiness activities, and the resulting increases in productivity, the living standards for the \npoorest people in the rural sector will decline, and they will be forced to migrate to other sectors. \nWelfare transfers from the Government comprise 9% of the income of this group. Increased \nagricultural value addition would reduce the need for such transfers. \n \nRicher agricultural households cultivate a larger proportion of high-value crops. The poorest \nhouseholds (bottom 20% of the expenditure quintile) utilize only 9.2% of cultivated area for the \nmore profitable fruits and vegetables, while the richest 20% utilize 17% of cultivated area for \nthese crops. Targeted initiatives to develop agribusiness will motivate poor farmers to shift from \nthe cultivation of coarse grains with low returns to high-value crops. This would increase returns \nto the farmer, as well as agricultural wages. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nLimited  access  to  capital,  small  landholdings,  inadequate  marketable  volumes,  and  limited \nbargaining  power  constrain  the  ability  of  poor  farmers  to  cultivate  higher-value  crops.  The \nformation of farmer societies will improve the participation of the poorest households as viable \nunits in the agribusiness value chain. \n \nThe incidence of poverty is highest in the provinces with the largest percentage of agricultural \nhouseholds: Uva (76%), North Central (83%), Sabaragamuwa (50%), and North East (53%). The \nexpansion  of  agribusiness  in  these  areas,  with  crop  and  product-specific  targeting  where \npossible, will reduce poverty significantly.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?

The stakeholders also include unemployed rural youth. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                  No  \nThe implementation of the TA will require a participatory approach due to diverse interests of the \nstakeholders. The participation strategy will be developed under the TA.   \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nNo adverse issues for women are anticipated. About 70% of rural women are engaged in \nsubsistence agriculture, of whom 56% work as unpaid family workers. Women employed as \nagricultural labor receive 75% of the wages received by men. Women who work as unpaid family \nlabor could increase incomes through involvement in high-value crops and value addition. In \naddition, women\u2019s traditional role in agriculture is at the post-harvest stage, and any expansion in \nagribusiness activities would create more opportunities mainly for women.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?
