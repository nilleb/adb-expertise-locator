The  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  is  designed  to  collect,  analyze,  and \ndisseminate knowledge from and among Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member \ncountries (DMCs) and ADB staff related to good practices and supporting policies for access by \nthe urban poor to justice through grievance and dispute prevention and settlement mechanisms. \nThe substantive focus of this knowledge product will be on initiatives and measures to handle \ngrievances and conflicts that typically and inevitably arise as a result of urbanization and urban \ndevelopment.1 These include grievances and conflicts that may arise in relation to land and \nhousing issues; access to basic goods and services, including utilities such as water and power \n(referred to as urban assets); and violence against vulnerable groups. The RETA framework is \nin Appendix 1.2 \n \n2.  The  Office of  the  General  Counsel  prepared  the  concept  paper  for  the  RETA  and \nsubmitted it  as part of its knowledge products  and services work plan for 2006\u20132008.3 The vice \npresident for finance and administration cleared the concept paper  on 16 May 2005, and it is \nincluded in the 3-year ADB-wide knowledge products  and services work plan (2006\u20132008) \napproved by the President on 3 October 2005. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Rapid urbanization and urban development are key challenges that almost all ADB \nDMCs face. Urban development is a key area of intervention for ADB,4 and ADB\u2019s urban sector \nstrategy expressly supports improvements in the rights situation of urban dwellers.5 The strategy \nrecognizes the need to reduce urban poverty through the creation of employment and the \nprovision of credit for informal businesses, education and literacy training, legal tenure to \ninformal settlers, improved social and infrastructure services and access to shelter, and \nsupport  for  better  human  rights  (including  the  right  to  vote  in  electing  representative \ngovernment and to organize at the community level).   \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s approach to implementing the urban sector strategy has involved decentralizing \nthe delivery of basic services to the urban poor. Participatory approaches have been identified \nas being particularly relevant in reducing urban poverty and in improving service delivery.6 \nHowever, to date, little attention has been given to decentralizing accessibility to and delivery of \njustice, establishing efficient and effective grievance procedures when decentralized service \ndelivery fails, and facilitating people\u2019s participation in the resolution of conflicts and disputes \nrelating to urban assets and safety. At the same time, as more people move from rural to urban \nareas and cities expand into previously rural areas, population pressures and the disruption of \nexisting social, cultural, and religious patterns of people\u2019s lives may result in poor urban \n                                                 \n1  Urban development in this context is not equated with urban development projects in ADB, but also refers to the \nmore general concept of growing and expanding cities.  \n2   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 November 2006.    \n3   The original title of the RETA was Enhancing Access to Justice through Improvement of Justice Delivery Systems. \nThe title was changed to clarify the RETA\u2019s focus. \n4  Urban infrastructure is a priority subsector under the Medium-Term Strategy II (ADB. 2006. Medium-Term Strategy \nII. Manila). \n5  ADB. 1999. Urban Sector Strategy. Manila (para. 29, page 10). \n6  See, for example, ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance Completion Report for RETA 5926: Public-Private Community \nPartnerships in Urban Services for the Poor. Manila: \u201c[T]he inclusion of NGOs and community groups in a well-\ndefined framework that specifies the roles of participating stakeholders greatly improves the chances of success in \nextending services to all.\u201d \n ", "2   \ncommunities becoming flash points for unrest.7 ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy points out that \nurban poverty is worsened by the speed of urbanization and that local governments cannot \nkeep pace. 8 In most DMCs, the urban poor must compete to survive in a situation of scarce \nresource  allocation.  According  to  the  urban  sector  strategy,  \u201cBiases  in  investments, \nstandards, pricing policies, and institutional structures often skew services in favor of the \nbetter-off  in  cities.\u201d 9  Against  this  backdrop,  individual  grievances  and  disputes  are \nunavoidable and need to be resolved quickly and fairly if they are not to escalate.  \n \n5.  Resolving these conflicts through formal justice institutions is difficult for the urban poor, \nwho lack the capacity to pay for legal counsel to guide them in protecting their rights and \nmaneuvering through the legal system.  Often, the urban poor may simply not possess the basic \nrequirements  to  start  judicial  proceedings.  Consequently,  they  are  vulnerable  to  abusive \nbehavior by corrupt officials, because the poor\u2019s capacity to understand the legal system is \nweak.  In  addition,  while  informal,  traditional,  or  customary  justice  systems  may  be  more \naccessible or better understood and trusted by local communities, these systems do not always \nprotect the rights of the poorest and most vulnerable. Moreover, there is often no authority that \nexercises oversight powers over these bodies. There is therefore a need to identify possible \nways whereby law and justice sector reforms can serve the interests of the poor and vulnerable \nmore directly. Grievance and dispute resolution mechanisms that are developed and operate \nwith strong community participation may be useful in preventing and mediating disputes at the \ncommunity level.  \n \n6.  Even though little attention has been given to decentralizing accessibility to and delivery \nof justice in poor urban settings, an ADB RETA  on Good Practice in Pro-Poor Service Delivery \nby Local Governments10 has provided a case study of how a community grievance mechanism \nhas  effectively  facilitated  pro-poor  urban  development.  The  example  of  Naga  City  in  the \nPhilippines is an interesting case study of a grievance mechanism that deals with tenure issues \nin an urban setting. Addressing informal settlers\u2019 lack of land tenure security by focusing on land \nacquisition  and  urban  upgrading,  the  city\u2019s  Partners  in  Development  Program  is  designed \nprimarily to empower informal urban settlers. The institutionalization of a tripartite mechanism \nfor permanently settling land tenure problems between landowners and land occupants is hailed \nas the program\u2019s single most important achievement. This tripartite mechanism brings together \ngovernment agencies, urban poor associations and their allied nongovernment organizations, \nand private landowners to permanently solve outstanding tenure problems. Today, all land \nproblems involving the urban poor in Naga use this mechanism. By recognizing organized \ngroups of urban poor as partners in resolving disputes relating to land acquisition and urban \ndevelopment, the program has helped give the urban poor legitimacy and has created better \neconomic and social opportunities for them. The program has also been reported as having \nended arbitrary ejection of the urban poor from privately owned land and minimizing court-\nsanctioned evictions.11 \n \n7.  While the information on the Naga City example is interesting, it is ad hoc. Thus there is \na need to collect information more systematically on initiatives pertaining to access to justice by \nthe urban poor and the role of grievance and dispute prevention and settlement mechanisms in \n                                                 \n7  Footnote 5 (para. 23, page 7). \n8  Footnote 5 (para. 28, page 9). \n9  Footnote 8. \n10 ADB. 2002.

Properly analyzed, such studies will provide a basis for \nunderstanding  what  works  and  what  does  not  work  in  this  area,  as  well  as  enabling  the \nidentification of replicable and context-specific features. This will lead to better understanding of \nthe prerequisites for  integrating a grievance and dispute resolution mechanism into the design \nof ADB projects that aim to address poverty reduction in an urban setting. The search for a pro-\npoor approach to law and justice sector reform is consistent with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy, which defines poverty as being not just the lack of material resources, but also the lack \nof power and choice.  \n \nIII.  THE  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The intended medium-term impact of the RETA is that ADB operations addressing \npoverty reduction in an urban setting would increasingly include a component or activities \nrelated to the establishment and operation of a grievance and dispute prevention and settlement \nmechanism.  \n \n9.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  RETA  is  a  sharing  of  knowledge  and  an  increased \nunderstanding by ADB staff and DMCs of good practices for the delivery of justice to the urban \npoor where existing formal judicial processes are ineffective. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The expected outputs of the RETA are (i) a compilation of examples of existing, effective \ngrievance and dispute resolution mechanisms in the region involving urban poor communities \nthat increase their members\u2019 resolution of disputes and access to justice and basic rights and/or \nprotect their members against violence, and this will include an analysis of the replicable and \ncontext-specific features of such practices; (ii) the training of relevant ADB staff on grievance \nand  dispute  prevention  and  resolution  mechanisms  for  the  urban  poor;  and  (iii)  the \ndissemination of the results, including through a regional seminar and a publication both in  hard \ncopy and on the Internet. \n \n11.  The RETA will start with a widely published invitation to DMC governments and civil \nsociety to submit descriptions of existing initiatives pertaining to urban grievance and dispute \nresolution mechanisms that actively involve poor urban communities in preventing or settling \ngrievances and disputes. The substantive focus of the initiatives will be in the areas of (i) land \nand housing; (ii) access to basic goods and services, including utilities such as water and \npower; or (iii) violence against women and vulnerable groups. Submissions will be invited \nthrough  international  development  web  sites,  ADB\u2019s  web  site,  and  advertisements  in  local \nnewspapers. Simultaneously, the RETA will identify existing good practices in ongoing ADB-\nfunded projects. From these, the best replicable examples will be selected and their initiators or \nimplementers will be invited to participate in one of four subregional workshops to discuss best \npractices and identify both replicable and context-specific features. Each subregional workshop \nwill identify one or two case studies that will be examined in more depth.  \n \n12.  The subregional workshops and the knowledge product that will be developed based on \nthe information shared during such workshops and on a desk review of available information will \nbe  centered  on  questions  such  as  the  following:  What  are  the  advantages  of  creating  a \ncommunity dispute resolution mechanism in urban settings? What issues become subject to \nsuch a dispute resolution mechanism?  What key principles underlie the formation of such \n ", "4   \ndispute resolution mechanisms? What are the legal issues that need to be sorted out in the \nformation of such dispute resolution mechanisms, for instance, what laws need to be reviewed \nand how binding is a resolution.  How can such a resolution mechanism be created? What are \nthe risks of creating the system and how can these be mitigated? Participants in the subregional \nworkshops will be invited to provide comments as the knowledge product is developed. \n \n13.  A final regional seminar will be held to present the findings of the RETA, which will be \ndisseminated further through the ADB web site and through an ADB publication. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $500,000. The RETA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Details of the cost estimate are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB, through the Office of the General Counsel in consultation with the Regional and \nSustainable  Development  Department  (RSDD)    and  the  regional  departments,  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency for the RETA and will be responsible for overall management and monitoring \nof RETA activities. RSDD  and the regional departments will be invited to be part of the team \nthat will undertake the initial screening of initiatives submitted for further study (para. 11). The \nresident missions will be asked to invite the submission of examples of good practices. The \ngood practices to be included in the in-depth studies under phase 2 of the RETA will be \ndetermined  based  on  the  submissions  received  and  on  the  information  gathered  during \nsubregional meetings. The RETA is expected to focus on four to six countries. A no-objection \nwill be obtained from relevant DMCs prior to starting in-depth case studies. \n \n16.  Up  to  9  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  be  required.  The \ninternational  consultant  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2006, as amended from time to time). The international consultant will have a \nstrong background in legal empowerment for the poor,  dispute prevention and settlement, \ngrievance procedures and mechanisms, and research. The international consultant will have an \nextensive network throughout the Asian region upon which he or she can draw to collect \ninformation. In addition, an individual national consultant may be recruited for up to 3 months in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to \ntime). The latter will be based in Manila and will assist with organizing and implementing the \nregional seminar. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The implementation details \nfor the phase 2 of the RETA will depend on the outcome of the first phase.  \n \n17.  The RETA will be implemented over 20 months starting in February 2007 and ending in \nSeptember 2008. The consultant will organize (i) four subregional workshops to solicit views \nfrom stakeholders, discuss features of good practices, and identify principles underlying such \ngood practices; (ii) one regional seminar to discuss the draft final report; and (iii) two training \nand dissemination activities for ADB staff.  \n \n18.  The reporting requirements for the consultant are as follows: (i) an inception report within \n4 weeks of commencement of the RETA; (ii) reports on the four subregional workshops; (iii) a \nreport on phase 2 of the study; (iv) a draft final report at least 2 months before the regional \nworkshop; and (v) a  final report, including the knowledge product, within 2 months of the \nregional seminar. The initial outline of the final report is in Appendix 4. \n \n ", "  5\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.
