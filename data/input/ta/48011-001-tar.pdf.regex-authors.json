INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  faces  complex  development  challenges, \nincluding significant poverty, rising income inequality, and widening regional disparities. These \nregional disparities are particularly acute in the country\u2019s inland regions. Growth in the west has \naccelerated but still lags behind the east.1 In 2012, the east\u2019s per capita gross domestic product \nwas  1.8  times  that  of  the  west;  the  average  annual  income  per  capita  in  the  east  was \nCNY32,713 for urban households and CNY13,919 for rural households, while in the west it was \nCNY22,475 for urban households and CNY8,857 for rural households.2 About 51% of the PRC\u2019s \npoor people live in the 12 provinces and autonomous regions in the west.3 \n \n2.  One of the PRC\u2019s top priorities is the development of its Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous \nRegion (XUAR), one of the northwest\u2019s poorest and most remote regions with a large population \nof  Uygur  (46%  of  the  population)  and  other  minority  ethnic  groups  (15%).  This  technical \nassistance (TA) addresses inclusive growth, one of three strategic pillars defining the PRC \ncountry partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015.4 As part of the inclusive growth strategy, the TA will \naugment  the  PRC\u2019s  twinning  initiatives  (part  of  the  government\u2019s  National  Strategy  for \nDevelopment of the Western Region), whereby more prosperous provinces and municipalities \nassist  less-developed  interior  regions.  (Guangdong,  Shandong,  Shanghai,  and  Shenzhen \nprovide targeted financial contributions to Kashi\u2014the cultural, economic, and administrative \ncenter of southern XUAR\u2014and will continue to do so through 2020.)5 \n \n3.  The  TA  will  draw  on  previous  and  ongoing  ADB  knowledge  work  (e.g.,  industrial \nrelocation,  special  economic  zones,  rural\u2013urban  integration,  and  agricultural  logistics  and \ntransformation). It will seek to enhance the regional development aspect of the PRC\u2019s national \nand regional Five-Year Plans. It will build on, further develop, and customize the outputs of an \nADB-funded  Provincial  Development  Strategy  for  XUAR,6 and  aim  to  augment  XUAR\u2019s \nparticipation in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program.7 The TA \nwill contribute to XUAR\u2019s overall development and lasting stability by adopting a more balanced \napproach that recognizes the benefits that urban and rural economies contribute to one another \nand identifies development needs specific to rural and urban economies. By augmenting the \ntwinning  arrangements,  the  TA  can  fortify  XUAR\u2019s  development.  By  examining  XUAR\u2019s \neconomic potential regionally, focusing initially on economic services that Kashi provides\u2014or \nmight  provide\u2014to  neighboring  prefectures  and CAREC  countries, the TA  can help  craft a \ndevelopment path for the four southern XUAR prefectures (Aksu, Hotan, Kashi, and Kizilsu) to \nbuild  an  inclusive  and  prosperous  society.  The  TA  may  also  identify  possible  investment \n                                                \n1 Eastern  10  provinces  (municipalities)  include:  Beijing,  Tianjin,  Hebei,  Shanghai,  Jiangsu,  Zhejiang,  Fujian, \nShandong, Guangdong and Hainan; and western 12 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) include: \nInner Mongolia, Guangxi, Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia and \nXUAR.

During the November 2013 country programming mission, the PRC requested that ADB \nprovide TA to complement, enhance, and sustain its development program for southern XUAR. \nAfter consideration, ADB elected to include the TA in the country operations business plan, \n2014\u20132016.8 A July 2014 TA reconnaissance mission included extensive consultations with \nXUAR officials in Urumqi and with Kashi prefecture officials, local government representatives, \nand regional business interests. These consultations included a thorough review of the concept \npaper  and  site  visits  to  logistics  centers,  special  economic  zones,  agricultural  processing \nfacilities, tourist attractions under development, a date orchard, and an industrial sheep farm. \nThe mission interviewed Kyrgyz truck drivers to understand the issues they face in crossing \nborders and consulted a representative of Tajik business interests to learn about his efforts to \npromote PRC\u2013Tajikistan trade. A wrap-up meeting was held in Kashi with a cross-section of \nXUAR, Kashi prefecture, and city officials. Following concept paper revision, the government \nagreed with the TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.9 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  XUAR faces serious urbanization challenges and has poor economic growth due to its \ndistance from major domestic markets and obstacles impeding access to regional markets in \nneighboring countries. Water availability is a critical concern for the fragile ecology, which is \npredominantly desert territory characterized by strong winds, low rainfall, and high evaporation \nrates. Infrastructure improvement and provision of basic urban services are needed to facilitate \nenvironmentally sustainable economic growth, essential for improving urban living conditions. \nXUAR cities also need to improve the services they provide to the rural economy through better \nintermediation of trade, access to financial services, and value-added processing of agricultural \nharvests and locally sourced raw materials. \n \n6.  A considerable development gap exists between northern and southern XUAR; roughly \n45% of XUAR\u2019s population is in the south, but the region creates just 25% of XUAR economic \noutput. Considering Changji, Karamay, and Urumqi as the center, the economic zone north of \nthe  Tianshan  Mountains  features  XUAR\u2019s  greatest  economic  development,  with  a  higher \nstandard of living and better infrastructure. This may be partly attributed to connectivity issues: \nUrumqi is situated on a major east\u2013west corridor (CAREC Corridor 1) linking the PRC with \nKazakhstan and supporting trade with Europe, and is linked nationally and regionally through \nfrequent commercial flight offerings. Conversely, Kashi, while well situated geographically\u2014as a \nkey origin and destination for trade along CAREC corridors 1, 2, and 5, featuring five border-\ncrossing  points  with  neighboring  CAREC  countries  and  India\u2014suffers  from  constrained \nconnectivity with less well-endowed neighbors (the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and Tajikistan \nlack the resource wealth of Kazakhstan). This is true both overland (rail service is reputedly \npoor  and  road  conditions,  terrain,  climate,  and  underdeveloped  border-crossing  facilities \ncomplicate regional trade) and by air (Kashi is connected to other areas almost exclusively via \nUrumqi). Southern XUAR exhibits a lower level of development, as nationally Aksu, Hotan, \nKashi, and Kizilsu prefectures rank as relatively underdeveloped. \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n9  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 August 2014.  \n ", "3 \n7.  The urbanization level in southern XUAR is also low. The low population density in urban \ncenters may be a result of resource constraints. Water access concerns limit the extent to which \nthe population can increase and industry can develop.10 Given its paucity of water resources, \nsome observers have expressed concern that overexploitation of water in southern XUAR\u2019s \noases may precipitate an ecological disaster. \n \n8.  Decisions by the Third Plenum of the 18th Party Congress provide a blueprint to deepen \na range of comprehensive structural reforms, including integrated development of urban and \nrural areas and building a new, open economic system.11 This blueprint, by focusing in part on \nincome  improvement  through  specialty  production  and  marketing  and  on  poverty-reducing \ntourism development, factors PRC\u2019s diversity into the design of development initiatives.  \n \n9.  To the extent possible, the TA will produce a strategy and corresponding implementation \naction plan for southern XUAR that supports the following: \n \n(i)  Accelerated development of village plans focused on addressing treatment of \nsolid waste and polluted water to improve the village environment.  \n(ii)  Improved use, management, and maintenance of public facilities: pave village \nroads, accelerate rural road construction, maintain and manage safety, provide \ndrainage, and improve rural\u2013urban transport services. In places with capacity, \nintroduce an integrated system of resident payment, village collective subsidies, \nand government financial support to provide management and maintenance fees.  \n(iii)  Preparation  of  traditional  village  protection  and  development  plans; \ndocumentation  of  historical,  cultural,  and  other  valuable  traditions  and  rural \nhousing in historical preservation rosters to increase investment and tourism. \n(iv)  Modernization of agricultural practices and agro-industrial processing to increase \noutput, value-added production, job creation, and rural income. \n(v)  Protection  and  conservation  of  the  ecosystem  that  sustains  oases  and  the \neconomic activity they support. \n(vi)  Development of a strategy to expand the use of solar, wind, and other renewable \nenergy options and introduce related high technology.  \n(vii)  Where conditions permit, development of household biogas consumption and \nmore intensive biogas production.  \n(viii)  Development  of  an  improved  rural  information  network  to  provide  the  rural \neconomy with broader access to market information. \n \n10.  The TA will also support efforts to identify poor counties and devise plans for village \npoverty reduction and enterprise development. The TA builds on prior ADB support for the \ndevelopment  of  urbanization  strategies  in  PRC. 12  It  aims  to  demonstrate  that  historic \npreservation and retention of cultural heritage complement economic development. \n \n                                                \n10  Wenlong Zuo et al. 2013.

The TA impact will be balanced rural\u2013urban economic development in southern XUAR. \nBy 2018, increased rural per capita net income in XUAR (to 90% of the national average as \nmeasured against the 2013 baseline of 81%) will substantiate impact. The outcome will be the \nrural community economic development. By 2016, achievement of this outcome, by comparison \nwith  2013  baseline  data  and  statistics,  will  be  substantiated  by  (i)  acknowledgement  and \nincorporation of policy recommendations proposed by this TA into the PRC and XUAR Five-\nYear Plans, (ii) upgraded transport and border-crossing infrastructure along CAREC corridors 1, \n2, and 5 to support regional cross-border trade flows, (iii) increased cross-border trade volumes \nto and from Kashi and other parts of CAREC (via Irkeshtam, Kulma, Kunjirap, and Torugart). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The two principal outputs will be (i) a 10-year (2016\u20132025) strategy and implementation \nplan on realizing balanced urban and rural, coordinated regional development in XUAR and (ii) \nstakeholder  ownership  of  the  strategy  and  implementation  plan.  Output  1  will  offer \nrecommendations on policies and guidelines for promoting balanced urbanization and on an \ninstitutional framework for implementation. It will be based on a series of subreports that will \nsupport stakeholder consultation workshops to be organized under output 2.  Output 2 will \nsupport  the  organization  and  conduct  of  broad-based  consultation  and  dissemination \nworkshops.  These  workshops  will  help  build  consensus  for\u2014and,  over  time,  stakeholder \nownership of\u2014the strategy. The inception report will provide a basis for the workshop in Kashi. \nIt will (i) review, revise, and customize subreport 8 of the Provincial Development Strategy \n(Promoting  Xinjiang\u2019s  All-round  Economic  and  Social  Development  through  Urbanization \nStrategy), taking into consideration of specific, special features of southern XUAR (with a focus \non Kashi, but covering all four southern prefectures to the extent time and information permit) \nand (ii) examine how best to proceed with developing Kashi as an economic center to open up \nXUAR\u2019s economy regionally. The interim report will give substance to the workshop in Urumqi. It \nwill examine the five dimensions of collaborative development, focusing on (i) approaches to \nbuilding new urbanization in XUAR and (ii) supporting new rural construction in XUAR modeled \non best national and international development practice in an ethnically heterogeneous setting, \nwhile relying on prudent and transparent financing approaches and recognizing the ecological \nfragility that may limit achievements. The final report produced under output 1 will serve as the \nbasis for conducting the final workshop in Beijing. As appropriate, and with the consent of PRC \nauthorities, consultant deliverables will be refined and published as knowledge products (e.g., \npolicy-based briefs, written case studies assessing international experience, and knowledge \nshowcases for high-level decision makers). \n \n13.  Assumptions  include  broad  stakeholder  involvement  in  the  consultation  and \ndissemination process; relevant data and information are readily available; and resulting policy \nrecommendations  are  practical,  implementable,  and  broadly  endorsed.  Risks  include  the \npossibilities  that  insufficient  sensitivity  to  cultural  heritage  and  historic  preservation,  and \ndifferences in institutional opinion about reform make it hard to achieve strategic consensus. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \n ", "5 \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  stakeholder  consultation  workshop  venues, \ntransportation for workshop participants, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  A total of 8 person-months of international and 29 person-months of national consultant \ninputs will be required to provide policy and advisory services under the TA. A consulting firm \nwill be recruited to assemble a team of experts as described in the outline terms of reference \n(Appendix 3) to carry out the proposed studies. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). The firm will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection procedures (80:20). The \nproceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 15 months, from 1 November 2014 to 31 \nJanuary 2016. The XUAR Finance Bureau will serve as the executing and implementing agency. \nThe XUAR Finance Bureau will ensure that the Office of Policy Research of Party Committee of \nXUAR and the Government and Party Committee of Kashi Prefecture  are engaged in TA \nimplementation and dissemination of its outputs. Together, they will ensure broad stakeholder \nparticipation  in  preparing  the  development  strategy  and  implementation  action  plan  and  in \ndisseminating  and  discussing  TA  outputs.  The  Public  Management,  Financial  Sector,  and \nRegional Cooperation Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will administer and supervise \nimplementation of the TA in collaboration with colleagues in the PRC Resident Mission. \n \n17.  ADB will maintain regular contact with the beneficiaries and consultants to ensure that \nwork proceeds according to the agreed schedules, and will participate in all three workshops to \nensure  that  stakeholder  views  and  concerns  are  adequately  addressed  in  consultant \ndeliverables. Three workshops will help in the broad dissemination of TA outputs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Implementing Balanced Urban\u2013Rural \nRegional Development in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2018:    Assumption \nBalanced rural\u2013urban  Increased rural per capita  Government publications  The government \neconomic  net income in XUAR (to    develops and \ndevelopment in  90% of the national  Statistical yearbooks  implements regionally \nsouthern XUAR  average, from 2013    respectful Five-Year \nbaseline of 81%)  Plans efficiently and \neffectively. \n \nRisk \nIneffective cross-agency \ncoordination delays \npolicy changes and \ninstitutional reforms. \nOutcome      Assumption \nRural community  By 2016 (as compared    Policy recommendations \neconomic  with 2013 baseline data    under this TA are \ndevelopment   and statistics):    relevant and reviewed \n    objectively by \nAcknowledgement and    government agencies. \nincorporation of policy   \nRisks \nrecommendations   \nDifferences of \nproposed by this TA into   \ninstitutional opinion \nthe PRC and XUAR Five-  \nabout reform make it \nYear Plans   \nhard to achieve \n   \nconsensus. \nUpgraded transport and  Government publications \nInsufficient resources to \nborder-crossing  (including China \nsupport trade facilitation \ninfrastructure along  Customs\u2019 annual \ninvestment program. \nCAREC corridors 1, 2,  reports) \nand 5 to support regional     \ncross-border trade flows \n \n \nIncreased cross-border  PRC and XUAR Five-\ntrade volumes to and  Year Plans \nfrom Kashi and other \n \nparts of CAREC (via \nIrkeshtam, Kulma, \nKunjirap, and Torugart) \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
