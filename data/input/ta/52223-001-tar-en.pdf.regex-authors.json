INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  midterm  review  of  Strategy  2020  and  the  new  Strategy  2030  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) recognize the need for and give priority to more effective and efficient \nimplementation of ADB-supported projects.1 One of ADB\u2019s key objectives is to improve the \nstandards in developing member countries (DMCs) by strengthening the capacity of executing \nand implementing agencies to plan, design, finance, and implement ADB-supported development \nprojects. The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will increase the efficiency and \neffectiveness of development projects, as well as their overall sustainability.  It will achieve this by \nreducing the risk of complaints to ADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism, thereby avoiding costs and \ndelays in project implementation. The TA will improve the understanding and application of \ngrievance  redress  mechanisms  (GRMs)  and  the  problem-solving  performance  of  DMCs\u2019 \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  and  other  key  stakeholders,  such  as  civil  society \norganizations. This will be accomplished through a capacity development and training program \ntargeting sector portfolios with high safeguards risk. The capacity building and training will build \non the recent experience of two regional departments in piloting the program across six locations \nin four countries. It will be enhanced by analytical research and the establishment of a network of \npractitioners on GRM and problem-solving or dispute resolution experiences in DMCs. ADB\u2019s \nOffice of the Special Project Facilitator (OSPF) will ensure close collaboration on this TA with the \nSustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change  Department  (SDCC)  and  the  Office  of  the \nCompliance Review Panel. This is funded by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF \n6) \u2013 Corporate Contingency.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s policy framework, such as for environment and social safeguards, consultation and \nparticipation, and access of project-affected people to ADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism (both for \nproblem-solving  or  dispute  resolution  and  compliance  review),  is  designed  to  improve \ndevelopment  effectiveness  and  sustainability.  A  key  provision  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) is the establishment of a GRM for each project. Access to a well-functioning \nGRM is intended to ensure that project-affected people\u2019s concerns are dealt with in a timely and \nfair manner. However, the capacity of executing agencies to design and implement effective \nGRMs varies across DMCs and sectors. \n \n3.  The number of complaints to ADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism, special project facilitator \n(SPF) and Compliance Review Panel, has significantly increased since July 2017.2 The likely \nreasons for this increase are (i) greater awareness and access to ADB\u2019s complaint-receiving \nsystem by project-affected people and communities and (ii) the growing size and complexity of \nADB's portfolio, particularly the increased emphasis on meeting the region\u2019s infrastructure needs. \nComplaints that are found to be eligible for action by either ADB\u2019s SPF or Compliance Review \nPanel tend to result in substantial project implementation delays and higher costs. \n \n4.  A key factor in avoiding the escalation of complaints to ADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism \nis a well-functioning GRM, according to stakeholders linked to past and ongoing complaints for \nproblem-solving and supported by a limited amount of analytical research. Based on the growing \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila; \nand ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n2  A total of 16 complaints were received between June 2016 and July 2017 and 43 complaints between July 2017 and  \nSeptember 2018. \n ", "2 \ndemand for support from ADB\u2019s operations departments and resident missions, the OSPF \ndeveloped  training  modules  on  GRM  and  problem-solving  tools,  and  designed  a  capacity \ndevelopment program targeting project implementers and other relevant stakeholders. In the first \nhalf of 2018, the program was piloted across six locations in Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, \nPakistan,  and  the  Philippines.  These  pilot  training  and  capacity  development  programs \ndemonstrated a high level of interest and demand from stakeholders to strengthen grievance \nredress and problem-solving capabilities to improve project impact and sustainability, as well as \nreduce time delays, costs, and other repercussions of formal complaints. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: improved project implementation performance, \nparticularly implementation of social and environmental management measures and will have the \nfollowing outcome strengthened capacity of DMCs to implement projects. This TA will strengthen \nthe  abilities  of  project  implementation  teams  (borrowers,  project  implementation  units,  and \nconsultants) to (i) institute preventive mechanisms for addressing grievances and improving \naccountability  and  (ii)  identify  and  manage  problems  and  complaints  early  in  project \nimplementation to avoid an escalation of issues that results in project delays and higher costs. \nThis will be achieved through a structured training program on GRMs and problem-solving\u2014\ndeveloped by the OSPF in 2016 and piloted in 2018 (para. 4)\u2014that will be rolled out at the country, \nsubregional, regional, and sector levels. \n \n6.  The TA is important and timely because one of the priorities of Strategy 2030 is to increase \ninnovative lending, particularly to address infrastructure deficiencies and urban development \nneeds. The growth in private and public sector operations will result in larger and more complex \ninvestments with higher risks of adversely affecting vulnerable populations. Strategy 2030 also \nrecognizes that ADB needs to be nimbler and faster in providing infrastructure and other lending. \nHowever, this may increase the risk of inadequate consultation and participation during project \npreparation and implementation, leading to an increase in complaints relating to social and \nenvironmental safeguards and other ADB policies. \n \n7.  The TA will support training and capacity development in cooperation with and based on \nthe demand from ADB\u2019s operations departments, with a country and/or sector focus. In addition, \nOSPF will work with the independent accountability mechanisms network partners, primarily at \nother multilateral development banks, to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the training. It \nwill also explore opportunities to better harmonize the problem-solving and dispute resolution \nprocesses of different multilateral development banks. This is particularly important given the \nincrease in cofinancing for both public and private sector investments. \n \n8.  The  TA  will  provide  capacity  development  and  training  for  country-level  project \nimplementation units, other project counterparts, and stakeholders engaged in project preparation \nand implementation. The support will be provided on a demand-driven basis from the operations \ndepartment to OSPF through the committee for about 12 training sessions over two years. In \naddition, the TA will support training at the regional and subregional levels, possibly focused on \nparticular sectors, to facilitate lesson sharing by individuals engaged in project planning and \nimplementation. To support the training under the TA and to ensure sustainability and cost-\neffective extension, the TA will provide training of trainers (TOT) at the country level so that \nnational counterparts working with ADB\u2019s country offices will be able to conduct the training \nregularly for project implementation units and others. The TA will also facilitate lesson sharing by \n ", "3 \nOSPF-retained facilitators who are engaged in ADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism problem-solving \nprocess in several DMCs. \n \n9.  The TA will also strengthen analysis of the most effective measures and approaches to \nbetter understand good practice for grievance redress and problem-solving. This will include an \nanalysis of project GRMs and related problem-solving experiences. Finally, the TA will improve \nthe ADB guidelines for problem-solving. \n \n10.  The main output will be a cadre of project implementation counterparts trained to address \nand  resolve  project-related  problems,  issues,  and  complaints  early  through  improved \nunderstanding of GRMs and problem-solving tools. \n \n11.  The main outcome will be improved sustainability of project investments and benefits as \na  result  of  better  performance  of  critical  elements  of  project  implementation,  particularly \nimplementation of social and environmental management measures. The TA activities is expected \nto result  in reduced risk of complaints from project-affected people being elevated to formal \ncomplaints to ADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism and associated delays and costs. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output  1:  Understanding  of  good  practice  for  project-level  grievance  redress \nmechanisms and problem-solving improved as a result of analytical work. The analytical \nwork  will  be  designed to  generate  high-quality  and  impactful knowledge  products that  will \ndocument GRM experiences and identify important lessons on problem-solving that are useful for \nfuture projects. Results of the research will be used to improve the case studies in the training \nmaterials and capacity development practice sessions, and also published as knowledge products \nfor broader dissemination. In addition to the analytical work for eligible complaints under ADB\u2019s \nAccountability Mechanism, the TA will be guided by ADB\u2019s GRM working group in the selection \nof case studies.3  \n \n13.  Output 2: Cadre of mediation and facilitation experts developed in developing \nmember countries. At least eight practitioners, including facilitators working with the OSPF on \ncurrent complaint problem-solving, will be trained through a TOT program. This will facilitate \nscaled-up, sustained, and high-quality GRMs and problem-solving training in DMCs. \n  \n14.  Output 3: Borrowers\u2019 capacity to design, implement, adapt, and monitor project \ngrievance redress mechanisms and problem-solving functions improved. Executing and \nimplementing agencies, private sector clients, and other project-relevant stakeholders will receive \nGRM and problem-solving training and capacity development. The training modules will be \ncontinually strengthened based on the country and subregional training program experiences and \nlesson-sharing workshops. These will be supplemented by analytical work focused on the case \nstudies of ADB project-level GRMs and problem-solving. All country-level training will focus on \nthe priority sectors supported by ADB\u2019s sovereign, public\u2013private partnership, and/or private \nsector operations in that country. Up to three subregional workshops will supplement the country- \nlevel programs when justified based on cost effectiveness or need for cross-country lesson \nsharing. \n                                                \n3  The Environment and Safeguards Division, SDCC, is conducting a study on \u201cgood practices and implementation \nexperience in grievance redress mechanisms.\u201d A working group of safeguards specialists from ADB\u2019s operations \ndepartments  has  been  established  to  assist  in  identifying  the  priority  sectors  and  countries,  finalizing  the \nmethodology, analyzing the results, recommending improvement measures, arriving at conclusions of the study, and \nsharing the results of the study across ADB. \n ", "4 \n \n15.  Output 4: Regional network of mediation and facilitation practitioners established. \nThe cadre of mediation and facilitation experts (output 2) will work with the OSPF and interested \ncounterparts from other independent accountability mechanisms active in the region to establish \na functional network of practitioners to share experiences and lessons from complaint handling. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. There will be no government counterpart support for this TA. \n  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA. The OSPF will implement the TA in close coordination with \nSDCC, the Office of the Compliance Review Panel, and operations departments. Participating \nresident missions will support the TA activities, including assisting with planning and implementing \ntraining and capacity development programs. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years in two phases of 12 months each. In the first \nphase, from September 2018 through August 2019, TA activities will include analytical work, TOT, \nand provision of five training and capacity development programs. The second phase, from \nSeptember 2019 through August 2020, will include provision of seven training and capacity \ndevelopment programs, convening of regional workshops, and initiation of the regional network \nof mediation and facilitation practitioners. \n \n19.  DMCs participating in the GRM and problem-solving training and capacity development \nprogram will be selected based on demand from operations departments and an assessment of \nrelative needs by the SPF and director general, SDCC. A committee, chaired by the SPF and \ncomprising representatives of each operations department and SDCC, will meet at the start of \neach phase to consider and agree on prioritization of DMCs and sectors to participate in the \ntraining and capacity development. The committee will also review and approve proposals for \nsubregional workshops. \n \n20.

All procurement will be carried out in \naccordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.   Consulting services. ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions. A team of individual consultants will support implementation, three subregional \npeer lesson-sharing workshops, and one regional or international symposium on future directions \nfor GRM andor problem-solving (including interested international development finance partners \nand  facilitators).  The  TA  will  finance  international  and  local  travel  and  accommodation  of \nparticipants, including the consultants working for ADB-supported projects in participating DMCs, \nto join the capacity building programs under the TA. It will also cover the travel costs of ADB staff \nacting as resource persons. Consultants will be recruited through output-based or lump-sum \ncontracts with a provision for fixed out-of-pocket expenditures for administrative and disbursement \nefficiency. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nCapacity Building for Grievance Redress and Dispute Resolution During Project Implementation, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is Aligned with \nSustainability of project investments improved, particularly implementation of social and \nenvironmental management measuresa \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nwith Targets and  Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nCapacity of DMCs to  Reduced risk reputational  Post-learning  Lack of DMC and \nimplement projects  and improved  evaluation and survey  operational demand \neffectively  accountability  and support \nTA completion report \nstrengthened \n(2018 baseline: NA) \nOutputs  By August 2020:     \n1.
