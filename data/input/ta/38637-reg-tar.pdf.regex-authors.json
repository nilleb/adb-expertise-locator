This technical assistance (TA) was first identified in the pipeline for the Draft Pacific \nRegional Strategy 2007. It is consistent with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Pacific \nstrategy\u2013Responding to the Priorities of the Poor: A Pacific Strategy for the Asian Development \nBank (2005\u20132009), which identifies improved availability and dissemination of quality data on \ndevelopment issues as a key result area. Moreover, the TA aligns with ADB\u2019s efforts to enhance \ndevelopment effectiveness and is incorporated into the Managing for Development Results \n(MfDR) Action Plan\u2013Report on Progress 2007 under Pillar 1 Increased Understanding and Use \nof Results Management in DMCs. A TA Fact-Finding Mission was conducted on 19\u201321 March \n2007.1  \n \nII.   ISSUES \n2.  The  limitation  on  quality  and  types  of  statistics  across  the  Pacific  inhibits  effective \nmonitoring  and  reporting,  socioeconomic  analysis,  informed  policy  making,  and  effective \nplanning. This impediment needs to be addressed in a sustainable manner through long-term \ncommitment by the region and its development partners. The demand for improvement has \nbeen recognized within the region. The Forum Economic Ministers Meeting (FEMM) in July \n2006 released the Forum Economic Action Plan where Ministers \u201cprioritized, as a matter of \nurgency, the upgrading of their statistical offices\u2026\u201d and \u201cencouraged the timely production of \neconomic and social statistics to support better outcomes.\u201d Forum leaders also recognized the \nissue  where  Strategic  Objective  12  of  the  Pacific  Plan  requires  \u201cimproved  transparency, \naccountability, equity and efficiency in the management and use of resources in the Pacific\u201d \n(Pacific Plan Strategic Objective 12.4). \n3.  Experienced development economists and statisticians of Pacific island countries (PICs) \nagree that there is a substantial gap between the official statistics needed and the statistics \nactually available in the Pacific region.2 Moreover, the widespread perception is that the gap is \nwidening between the demand for official statistics and the available supply.\u201d3  \n4.  The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) reviewed statistical capacity \nin seven countries in 2000\u20132002, focusing on macroeconomic data. It concluded that progress in \nstatistical  development  had  been  uneven  and  that  the  capacity  of  national  information \nmanagement systems to generate macroeconomic data varied considerably between countries. \nIn general, the problems of timeliness and quality of data meant that countries fell short of the \nguidelines of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) General Data Dissemination System \n(GDDS). Technical assistance was especially needed to strengthen national accounts and \nbalance of payments data.  \n5.  Social statistics are derived through population censuses, administrative records of the \nministries responsible for social programs, household income and expenditure surveys (HIES), \nand demographic and health surveys (DHS). ADB has been supporting HIES work within the \nregion. With assistance from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 17 July 2007. \n2  ADB 2005. A Road Map for Supporting Statistical Development in the Pacific (forthcoming), Parry points in \nparticular to \u201cthe very poor state of economic statistics throughout the region, compounded by the demands for \nbetter and more timely key macroeconomic indicators\u201d; but adds that development of social statistics is also \nrequired. \n3  ADB 2005. A Road Map for Supporting Statistical Development in the Pacific (forthcoming), Hughes observes that \nnational statistics offices (NSOs) \u201cgenerally have difficulty collecting and processing data necessary for orthodox \nmeasurement of economic activity.\u201d Parry (2004) notes that \u201cthe overall range, quality and timeliness of official \nstatistics in the Pacific region falls well short of what is required for effective analysis and policy formulation.\u201d \n ", "2   \nthe New Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID), ADB has also piloted DHS in \nthe region over the last 2 years. This work will need to continue in partnership with other \ndevelopment partners and regional organizations to slowly build capacity over the next 10 years.  \n6.  Data for monitoring improvements in public service delivery, the private sector enabling \nenvironment, and the governance environment is limited.4 The World Bank \u201cdoing business\u201d \nindicators,  United  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s  (UNDP)  governance  indicators,  and \nsurvey work on the prevalence of HIV/AIDs provide some information for monitoring gross \nchanges over time. In general, Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) fall short in \ngenerating the data required for results-based management and monitoring of national poverty \nreduction  strategies,  national  development  plans,  and  progress  toward  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \n7.  National  information  systems  (NISs)  have  failed  to  meet  the  growing  national  and \ninternational demand for statistics as (i) the number of their qualified staff and their operating \nbudgets are inadequate, (ii) national statistical development strategies have been generally \nabsent, (iii) processing systems and outputs are not yet harmonized, and (iv) little attention has \nbeen paid to promoting the use of administrative data.  \n8.  The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), AusAID, NZAID, PFTAC, ADB, and \nothers have (i) provided ongoing capacity-building assistance to PDMCs\u2019 national statistics \noffices (NSOs); (ii) supported data collection through HIES, DHS, and census processes across \nthe region; (iii) provided direct support to national finance and planning ministries; and (iv) \nsupported the development and management of NISs through regional collaboration. These \nsurvey-focused efforts, while valuable in themselves, are not delivering a sustainable regional or \nnational capacity. \n9.  The broad architecture is in place at the national level, but regional institutions are not \nyet  aligned  to  provide  a  coordinated  regional  response.  A  number  of  models  have  been \nproposed.  They include (i) a regional economic advisory and statistics unit within the Pacific \nForum  Secretariat  (PFS),  (ii)  expansion  of  the  role  of  PFTAC  to  strengthen  the  statistical \ncapacity for economic statistics and economic advice within the region, and (iii) expansion of the \nSPC demography and statistics unit to improve national economics statistics capability.  \n10.  Determining the way forward must be driven from within the region. The Forum leaders \nhave tasked the PFS to report back to its 2007 meeting with options for the future. This will \nnecessarily  include  comments  on  the  level  of  development  partner  support.  The  PFS,  in \ncollaboration with the SPC, will undertake a study to identify the capacity of statistical services \nin PDMCs and propose a way forward to strengthen the services through regional approaches.  \nADB has been asked to fund and participate in this study. \n11.  While regional organizations, national governments, and the Forum leaders develop a \nstrategy for strengthening the economic and social statistics capacity in the region, ADB and \nother development partners should participate when invited into this debate and prepare to be \nable to respond when the opportunity arises so that momentum is not lost. \n12.  Existing activities and possible future support for DHS and HIES work need to be flexible \nand adaptive as new roles and responsibilities for regional organizations unfold. Moreover, ADB \nshould be ready to support future initiatives in strengthening economic statistics and advisory \n                                                 \n4  World Bank\u2019s \u201cDoing Business\u201d indicators are data series that will permit regional and international comparisons. \nUNDP.  2003.  Sources  for  Democratic  Governance  Indicators.  Oslo.  lists  numerous  providers  of  various \ngovernance indicators, but its sources are narrow within Pacific island countries. \n ", "  3\nservices in the region as a continuation of our close partnership in this area and in recognition of \nADB\u2019s comparative advantage in providing this type of advice. \n13.  Strengthening the capability of the Pacific region to develop and utilize economic and \nsocial statistics in a sustainable manner is imperative for development planning, articulating \nsound  development  policies,  and  improving  public  sector  service  delivery.  This  has  been \nrecognized by Forum leaders and development partners and as such the demand for this \nsupport is evident. In accordance with ADB\u2019s policies \u2015 Weakly Performing Countries Policy \nand MfDR \u2015 it is proposed that the TA to address the issues outlined above be delivered \nthrough a cluster TA approach. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The intended impact of the TA is improved MfDR within PDMCs. The outcome of the \nproject is to improve PDMCs\u2019 capacity to utilize economic and social statistical information for \ninformed  planning  and  policy  decisions.  This  outcome  can  only  be  achieved  in  a  phased \napproach led and driven by the region itself, which is consistent with ADB\u2019s commitments to the \nParis Declaration and its commitment to support the implementation of the Pacific Plan. The \nfollowing are the proposed subprojects of the cluster TA.  \n(i)  Subproject  1.    The  objective  is  to  develop  PDMCs\u2019  regional  solution  to \nstrengthening the delivery of economic and social statistical services. Outputs will \ninclude  (a)  a  stocktaking  of  national  and  regional  capabilities  for  generating \neconomic statistics, (b) a strategy for upgrading statistical information databases \nin the region, and (c) a proposal to strengthen the preparation of economic \nstatistical information and its implementation within the region. \n(ii)  Subproject 2. The objective is to support social and economic statistical surveys \nin selected PDMCs. Outputs include (a) technical and financial support to HIES \nin selected PDMCs, and (b) technical and financial support to DHS in selected \nPDMCs. \n(iii)  Subproject 3. The objective is to support the implementation of the regional \nsolution to strengthening the delivery of economic and social statistical services \nas  identified  through  subproject  1.  Outputs  may  include  (a)  in  partnership, \nimplementing  the  national  and/or  regional  economic  statistics  plans;  (b) \npromoting  linkages  between  organizations  developing  economic  statistical \ninformation,  and  national  planning  and  policy  development  ministries;  (c)  \npromoting  the  use  of  economic  statistics  in  national  planning  and  policy \ndevelopment through the provision of technical advice, assistance, and support; \nand  (d)  building  capacity  for  the  use  of  economic  statistics  in  MfDR  at  the \nministry CEO and ministerial levels. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  Subproject 1 is to be delivered through the PFS to whom the Forum leaders have given \nthe mandate for the study. Stocktaking will be conducted through a review of existing statistical \ninformation  databases,  literature  review,  face-to-face  consultations  with  eight  PDMCs,  and \nconsultations by phone and interviews through PDMC embassies in Suva. The study will be \nconducted by a team of two: a regional eminent person to assess the strategic and political \ndimension, and a statistics advisor to undertake the technical assessment. \n ", "4   \n16.  The team will also collect information necessary to outline an implementation plan for \nstrengthening statistical services. The outputs of subproject 1 will be used to define subprojects \n2 and 3. \n17.  Stocktaking will take 45 days to draft, which will require further consultation with PDMCs \nbefore the draft is finalized. The report will encompass the current capacity of statistical services \nin the region, identify the future needs of PDMCs for statistical services, and estimate the cost of \nthe resources to meet those needs. A costed strategy for maintaining and/or upgrading the \ncurrent statistical information databases will form part of the report. A proposed approach to \nstrengthen the preparation of economic and social statistical information and its interpretation \nwithin the region will form a separate report. \n18.  Partnership approaches will be a key element for subprojects 2 and 3. ADB\u2019s strategy of \nengagement  to  date  has  been  to  support  a  regional  capacity  and,  through  it,  foster  the \nengagement of other development partners. This approach remains appropriate, given the \nquantum  of  resources  that  are  likely  to  be  required  and  ADB\u2019s  history  and  comparative \nadvantage in economic and social statistics in the region. \n19.  Prior to releasing funds for either subprojects 2 or 3, a memorandum detailing the: (i) \nprogress of the TA to date; (ii) objectives, scope, and intended outputs of the subproject; (iii) \nterms of reference for the consultants; (iv) cost estimates; and (v) implementation arrangements \nwill be prepared for consideration by the Director General PARD. Additional criteria for further \nengagement will  be considered; they may include the quantum of development partner funding, \nthe commitment demonstrated by each individual PDMC to strengthening  statistical services, \nand support to the regional organizations that will provide technical expertise and statistical \nservices \n20.  Subproject 2  continues  the  survey  work  already  started by  ADB  and  supported  by \nAusAID and NZAID. Before implementing a further program of HIES and participatory poverty \nassessment  activities,  ADB  will:  review  lessons  learned  through  RETA6157  Strengthening \nPoverty Analysis and Strategies in the Pacific,5 seek agreement for an ongoing cycle of HIES \nand participatory poverty analysis in each country, and identify other sources of funding. For \nevery $1.00 ADB contributed through RETA6157, additional funding of $1.10 had come from \nother development partners.  \n21.  Before designing and implementing further DHS in other PDMCs, ADB will review the \nfindings of its current pilot program RETA6258 DHS in selected PDMCs6 and the level of \nadditional sources of funding. For every $1.00 ADB contributed through RETA6258, additional \nfunding of $1.30 had come from other development partners. \n22.  Key outputs of an HIES and participatory poverty assessment are analyzed and reported \ndata from an international standard HIES, a poverty assessment resulting in provincial and \nnational poverty line data, and a country poverty assessment report. Key activities include \ndeveloping the survey instruments for the country, training enumerators, conducting surveys, \nanalyzing data, and preparing reports. \n23.  Key outputs of a DHS are an international standard DHS country report, and tabulated \nDHS data. Key activities include developing the survey instruments for the country, training \nenumerators, conducting surveys, analyzing data, and preparing reports. \n                                                 \n5  ADB 2004 Countries covered under the RETA are Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Palau, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. An \nHIES has been conducted for Nauru under RETA 6009. \n6  Countries covered under the RETA are Marshall Islands, Nauru, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. \n ", "  5\n24.  Subproject 3 supports the implementation of the regional solution to strengthening the \ndelivery  of  economic  and  social  statistical  services.  Without  pre-empting  the  findings  of \nsubproject 1 and for indicative purposes only, the approach in subproject 3 may be the long-\nterm support to a Pacific regional organization whose objective is to strengthen and coordinate \nthe collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of economic and social data and \nindices, in a manner relevant to the capability and resources within each PDMC. \n25.  Key outputs are likely to be support in implementing national statistics plans; ongoing \ntechnical advice in the preparation of economic and social statistics; provision of economic \nadvisory  services  for  more  effective  use  of  economic  and  social  statistics  in  development \nplanning and policy articulation; strengthening the quality and timeliness of regional and national \nstatistical  information  databases;  and  creating  linkages  between  regional,  national,  and \ninternational stakeholders. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n26.  ADB  will  fund  a  maximum  amount  of  $1,000,000  for  all  the  clusters.  The  three \nsubprojects will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program, with in-kind inputs \nfrom PFS and SPC staff as managers of the study. The cost for subproject 2 cannot be \ndetermined until subproject 1 is complete and the level of additional funding is ascertained. An \nindicative HIES/participatory poverty assessment cost is approximately $200,000 with the DHS \ncost averaging $500,000. The cost for subproject 3 would be predominantly financed through \nSPC with top up funding from AusAID and/or NZAID directly to SPC. \n27.  Other direct funding for subprojects 2 and 3 will be discussed with AusAID and NZAID \nafter subproject 1 is complete. Funding from these agencies may go directly to the regional \ninstitutions of SPC and PFS. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n28.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months beginning November 2007. Due to the \nphased nature of implementation, ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Implementation \narrangements for each phase will be determined and approved at the start of each subproject.  \nThe Implementing Agency for subproject 1 will be PFS. The consultants will be engaged by \nADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time) for subproject 1. \n29.  The approach outlined in this TA enables the regional bodies and the PDMC leaders to \nwhom they report to have flexibility in developing their own approach to strengthening systems \nand approaches to the collection and dissemination of economic and social statistics.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n30.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the \nTA cluster approach; and (ii) the provision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $1,000,000 on a grant basis for Support for Results-Based Management in the Pacific, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicatorsa  Mechanisms   and Risksb \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved management  National development plans  National development  \u2022  Improved planning leads \nfor development results  including a realistic results  plans released near  to improved delivery of \nin selected PDMCs  framework  project completion  statistical services in \nselected PDMCs. \n \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEconomic and social  30% of relevant Cabinet  Report by Cabinet Office  \u2022  Statistical information is \nplanning and policy  papers containing statistical  accessible to politicians. \ndecisions informed by  analysis of the impacts of the  \u2022  Politicians are willing to \nstatistical information  proposed policy or plan by  balance statistical \n  project completion  information with political \npriorities \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \nSubproject 1      \u2022  Genuine agreement of \n1.

Background \n1.  Developing and implementing the Pacific Plan for Strengthening Regional Cooperation \nand Integration highlighted the need for, and access to, quality statistical information.  Quality \ndata  is  required  to  formulate  development  policies  and  to  evaluate  national  and  regional \npriorities. Pacific Plan Initiative 12.4 recognizes the need to \u201cupgrade and extend country and \nregional statistical information systems and databases across all sectors.\u201d  In addition, Initiative \n12.8  of  the  Plan  highlights  the  potential  to  \u201cestablish  an  accountable  and  independent \nmacroeconomic and microeconomic technical assistance mechanism (including statistics) to \nstrengthen treasury and finance functions and provide economic analysis.\u201d \n   \n2.  The Forum Economic Ministers Meeting (FEMM) in 2006 reaffirmed the value of regional \neconomic integration, and in this context requested the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) \nand other regional agencies, including the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), to \nexamine the feasibility of regional approaches to strengthening statistical services, and to report \nback to FEMM in 2007. \n \n3.  A preliminary cost-benefit analysis1, undertaken prior to the formulation of the Pacific \nPlan, identified the potential for regional approaches to address the current challenges in the \narea of statistics, and proposed either a whole-of-region statistical organization charged with all \naspects of statistics, or a specialized regional or subregional statistics office to make quality \nimprovements  in  statistical  information,  and  enhance  the  productivity  of  the  mechanisms \ncurrently used to produce key economic and social statistics. \n \nB.  Objective \n4.  The consultants will (i) assess and take stock of current statistical mechanisms (both in-\ncountry and regional) that can be examined against country needs and priorities, to enable the \ndevelopment of a long-term strategy; (ii) provide an implementation strategy aimed at upgrading \ncountry and regional statistical information systems and databases across all sectors; and (iii) \npropose appropriate regional solutions to current problems in the delivery of statistical services, \nincluding  exploring  the  feasibility  of  the  possible  modalities  for  the  provision  of  regional \nstatistical services. \n \n5.  The results of the activities in para. 4 will form the basis of specific recommendations to \nthe 2007 FEMM and progress reporting on Pacific Plan Initiatives 12.4 and 12.8 to the Pacific \nPlan Action Committee. \n \n                                                 \n1   Refer to A Regional Statistics Office for the Pacific available: http://www.pacificplan.org/tiki-\ndownload_file.php?fileId=141, and Toward a New Pacific Regionalism \u2013  \navailable: http://www.pacificplan.org/artimages/Toward%20a%20New%20Pacific%20Regionalism.pdf. \n ", "10      Appendix 3 \n \nC.  Specific Duties \n6.  A report, entitled \u201cStrengthening Statistical Services through Regional Approaches: A \nBenchmark Study and Way Forward\u201d will be prepared. The report will draw on relevant research \non the subject, including research conducted by the consultants through travel to a number of \nPacific developing member countries (PDMCs), and from direct contact with the remaining \nPDMCs  and  key  development  partners.  Recent  literature  as  well  as  the  consultants\u2019  own \nexperience and knowledge will also be used.  \n \n7.  The report will have three parts.  \n \n(i)    Part A will review and document: \n \n(a)  the  underlying  country  and  stakeholder  requirements  for  statistical \ninformation, including consultation with national statistics and planning \noffices,  CROP  agencies,  and  relevant  development  partners  with \ninvolvement in statistical work in the PDMCs. This task should identify key \ndata needs in relation to national needs and priorities. The consultants \nwill refer to policy priorities of the respective Governments as detailed in \ntheir national development plans and/or related documents;  \n(b)  the inputs/outputs of existing national mechanisms for statistical services \nin  the  identified  priority  areas,  including  budgets,  capacity-building \nprograms, and resources (equipment and human resources), statistical \npublications, monitoring and evaluation. The consultants are not expected \nto conduct a detailed analysis; however, the report must capture the cost \nand resource structure of delivering statistical outputs; \n(c)  the current key regional and international support mechanisms provided \nto the PDMCs in meeting their statistics needs; and  \n(d)  the  productivity  of  various  national  statistical  services  by  comparing \ndifferent inputs against quantitative and qualitative outputs. \n(ii)  Referring to the findings of part A, part B will examine and identify the constraints \nto delivering statistics to sector(s)/area(s) of importance; including capacity and \nresource constraints that inhibit the collection, consolidation, analysis, and timely \npublication of statistical data for sectors of national importance; and constraints \nto regional and international reporting requirements and standards. \n \n(iii)  Part C will build a regional implementation strategy \n \n(a)  that draws on lessons from national efforts to provide statistical services; \nand with reference to national data priorities and constraints identified in \nparts A and B, outline service delivery model/s that consider all possible \nmodalities of regionalism, including subregional configurations, and the \nmost productive use of resources to address national and international \nstatistical requirements; and \n(b)  that  includes  an  economic  cost  and  benefit  analysis  of  the  possible \nregional approaches/solutions. The consultants are expected to include \n ", "Appendix 3               11 \nfinancial  and  nonfinancial  implications  of  establishing  appropriate \nconfigurations of regional statistics services, and should briefly consider \npossible regional funding mechanisms. \nD.  Required Outputs and Indicative Timelines \n8.  A draft evaluation report not more than 50 pages long (including the executive summary) \nwill be submitted by March 2008. This study will involve travel to selected PDMCs, including Fiji, \nKiribati, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu. \nThe study will require consultation with other PDMCs through the respective high commissions \nand embassies as well as direct contact with relevant Government authorities, relevant CROP \nagencies, and relevant development partners and aid agencies with involvement in the area of \nstatistics. \n9.   A final report will be submitted by April 2008, incorporating comments received from the \nPIFS and the SPC on the draft study. \n10.  A Powerpoint presentation, lasting no more than 15 minutes (maximum of 10\u201312 slides), \nwill highlight the key points of the study to an audience comprising PIFS and SPC officials (and \nsenior government officials), as required. \n11.  All  reports  will  be  presented  in  A4  format.  Electronic  versions  of  Microsoft  Excel \nWorksheets, and Powerpoint and Word documents will be e-mailed.   \nE.  Inputs \n12.  A total of 45 working days has been allocated for the completion of the draft study, with \nanother 5 working days to finalize the study following receipt of comments on the draft study \nfrom the PIFS and the SPC.   \n13.  The study will comprise a combination of in-country consultations, wide consultations, \nand desktop analysis. It is envisaged that the consultants will devote consultancy time of around \n55% on part A, 15% on part B, and 30% on part C.  \nF.  Consultant Expertise \n14.  Each of the two consultants will be contracted for 50 days of inputs during the study. \nEach of the two individual contracted consulted should have: \n \n(i)  demonstrated familiarity with developing countries, small states, and PDMCs; \nand first-hand experience with statistics issues in a number of those countries;  \n(ii)  tertiary qualifications related to the field of statistics, with a strong sense of public \npolicy and familiarity with development economics; \n(iii)  specific understanding of the operations of statistical offices and the important \nrole they play in supporting economic and social policy/reform programs, and \ndevelopment priorities; \n(iv)  excellent  writing skills; and \n(v)  ability to meet the required deadlines. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20071022091117+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "pacific results based management support, regional macroeconomic stability promotion, asian organizational development projects, millennium development goals, united nations development programme, tacr: reg 38637", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20071109110826+08'00'", "Title": "Support for Results-Based Management in the Pacific"}, "author_page": " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \nAusAID  \u2013  Australian Agency for International Development \nDHS  \u2013  demographic and health survey \nFEMM  \u2013  Forum Economic Ministers\u2019 Meeting \nGDDS  \u2013  General Data Dissemination System \nHIES  \u2013  household income and expenditure survey \nIMF  \u2013  International Monetary Fund \nMDG  \u2013  Millennium Development Goals \nMfDR  \u2013  managing for development results \nMOU   \u2013  memorandum of understanding \nNIS  \u2013  National Information System \nNSO  \u2013  National Statistics Office \nNZAID  \u2013  New Zealand Agency for International Development \nPDMC  \u2013  Pacific developing member country \nPFS  \u2013  Pacific Forum Secretariat \nPFTAC  \u2013  Pacific Financial and Technical Assistance Centre \nPIC  \u2013  Pacific Island Countries \nSPC  \u2013  Secretariat of the Pacific Community \nTA  \u2013  technical assistance \nUNDP  \u2013  United Nations Development Programme \n     \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  General intervention \nSector  \u2013  Law, economic management, and public policy \nSubsector  \u2013  Economic management \nThemes  \u2013  Sustainable economic growth, capacity development \nSubthemes  \u2013  Promoting macroeconomic stability, organizational \ndevelopment \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community ends on 31 \nDecember.
