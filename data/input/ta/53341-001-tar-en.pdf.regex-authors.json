INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Ministry of Energy (MOE) of Kazakhstan asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto provide knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) to improve the country\u2019s renewable \ntechnology-inclusive heat supply legislation. 1 This TA project is in line with the goals of ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Kazakhstan, 2017\u20132021, but is not included in the country \noperations business plan for Kazakhstan, 2020\u20132022.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Kazakhstan is rich in natural resources, including fossil fuel, ranking ninth in the world in \nterms of proven oil reserves and 15th in terms of natural gas reserves.3 It is also the world\u2019s eighth \nlargest producer of coal and the largest exporter of uranium ore.4 Coal accounts for 70.4% of \nKazakhstan\u2019s energy mix, followed by natural gas (19.4%), with renewables accounting for just \n10.2%.5 As a result, Kazakhstan emits more greenhouse gases (GHG) (14,363 metric tons per \ncapita) than any country in Central Asia or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD).6 Kazakhstan\u2019s economy is largely dependent on revenues from fossil fuel \nexports and is therefore susceptible to fuel price volatility. \n \n3.  Kazakhstan also has significant renewable energy resources, yet their utilization is low \n(para. 2). As of 2019, out of all renewables utilized, the share of hydro power is 82%, which is  \n8.6% in overall energy mix, onshore wind is 3.9%, and solar photovoltaic is 2%.7 In addition, \nuntapped geothermal potential ranges between 70\uf0b0C and 160\uf0b0C.8  \n \n4.  In 2013, the Government of Kazakhstan adopted the national Concept for the Transition \nto a Green Economy until 2050 (Strategy 2050), outlining an ambitious plan to (i) increase the \nshare of renewable and alternative energy in power generation (to 3% by 2020, to 30% by 2030, \nand to 50% by 2050);9 and (ii) reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions.10 In this \nrespect, the energy and heat sector is the biggest challenge on the government\u2019s agenda. \nAccording to an OECD report, the energy sector generates about 80% of greenhouse gas \nemissions in Kazakhstan, 90% of which come from heat generation.11   \n \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section (consulting opportunities) of ADB\u2019s website on 18   \nFebruary 2020. \n2  ADB. 2019.

The heat supply sector of Kazakhstan was created in the late 1970s during the Soviet era. \nThe heat supply network consists of 12,300 kilometers of pipes and 2,427 heat producers, of \nwhich 45% are combined heat and power (CHP) plants, 35% are large boilers, and 20% are small \nboilers. About 44% of the heat pipes are above-ground and have inadequate insulation.12 The \ndistrict heating plants run mostly on coal, although some use natural gas or black oil (mazut). \nThese outdated, poorly maintained assets cause frequent disruptions in the supply of heat to end \nusers. Heat system loss is estimated to be about 30% (exact data is not available because of an \nabsence of metering).13 Heat consumption is billed per square meter of space and does not reflect \nactual usage.14  \n \n6.  Government  of  Kazakhstan  has  kept  heating  tariffs  low  for  social  reasons  yet  has \nassumed that tariffs are sufficient to cover the costs and maintenance of the assets. In 2019, \nGovernment of Kazakhstan decreased the tariff for heating by 14% compared with 2018.15 As a \nresult of low tariffs and unmeasured consumption, district heating companies cannot generate \ncapital to upgrade their assets, thus, heat supply systems are facing technical and financial \ndeterioration. \n \n7.  The institutional setup of the district heating sector is complex, involving many public and \nprivate stakeholders. Roles and responsibilities of public agencies are unclear and often overlap. \nNorms regulating heat supply are scattered among various legal acts, increasing ambiguity. There \nis neither a specific or overarching law on heat supply or district heating nor technical standards \nand mandatory heat planning. \n \n8.  In 2016, ADB provided support to the Karaganda region, which has the largest heat supply \nnetwork (2,164 kilometers) in the country, through the Karaganda District Heating Network \nRehabilitation Project.16 The project supported upgrades of the district\u2019s heating distribution \nnetwork. However, the targeted loan project did not materialize because of the ineffective sector \nstructure and the unclear contractual arrangements along the chain. For the same reasons, it has \nbeen difficult to attract private investors in the sector. One of the major recommendations of TA \n8253-KAZ: Karaganda District Heating Network Rehabilitation Project Completion Report was to \nhelp the government complete the institutional restructuring of the heating sector before any future \nintervention whether a loan or a grant. \n \n9.  In March 2019, the MOE of Kazakhstan requested ADB support in drafting a new Law on \nHeat Supply and the respective legislation. The new legislation is critical for creating a balanced \nand clear regulatory framework, setting clear targets and an overarching plan on increasing share \nof renewables and improving energy efficiency standards in the heat sector. The OECD suggests \nthat  improving  energy  efficiency  standards  in  Kazakhstan\u2019s  heating  sector  can  reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 12.6\u201313.8 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, out of \n229.95 million tons of CO emitted annually (footnote 9). Integrating renewables into existing \n2 \nfossil-fuel-based heating systems will further reduce CO emissions by lowering consumption of \n2 \n \n12 ADB. 2014.

However, according to the Climate Laws, Institutions and Measures \n(CLIM)  Index,  Kazakhstan  (61st  in  the  world)  faces  challenges  in  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of relevant policies.17 Thus, assistance to Kazakhstan in drafting an effective \npolicy and regulatory framework is timely and needed.  \n \n10.  Kazakhstan has been severely affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. \nAs of 31 August 2020, 105,795 of COVID-19 cases were confirmed,  of which the highest numbers \nwere reported in Nur-Sultan with 13,822 and 14,222 in Almaty City.18 The GDP in January\u2013July \n2020 contracted by 2.9% (for January\u2013June the number was -1.8%) (footnote 18). Lockdowns \nintroduced to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 infections resulted in slowdown of business \nactivities and uncertainty regarding the prospects of economic recovery. Short-term economic \nindicator19 for January\u2013July 2020 declined by 2.7% compared to the corresponding period in 2019 \n(footnote 18). This TA will help to mitigate the adverse economic impact of COVID-19 in medium \nand long term. One of the main results targeted under this TA is to reduce subsidies from the \nstate budget aimed at supporting the heating sector. Instead,  the country will be able to use the \nbudgetary funding for its anti-crisis response measures and for expanding the social safety nets. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) CO  emissions in electricity and heat \n2\nproduction reduced by 15% by 2030 (baseline 2013) and (ii) the share of alternative energy \nsources increased to 30% by 2030 (footnote 8). The TA will have the following outcome: Heat \nSupply Law adopted by the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan.20 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Gap analyses of the heat supply sector conducted. Consultant will conduct \na technical and legal due diligence of the heat supply sector to assess the current circumstances \nand possible gaps. The gap analyses report will include a gender assessment of the sector. \n \n13.  Output 2: Renewable technology-inclusive heat supply legislation drafted. Based on \nthe gap analyses, Consultant will develop a draft Law on Heat Supply and other normative acts \n(including technical standards, tariff methodology, and heating development planning). The new \nlegislation will establish a regulatory framework and incentive scheme for using renewable \nsources in heat supply, and for improving energy efficiency standards.21 Consultant will support \nthe MOE at all stages of the government review process, including the parliamentary hearings. \n \n \n17 The Climate Laws, Institutions and Measures Index of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \ncompares the quality and depth of climate policies, measures, laws, and institutions. \n18 The Committee on Statistics of Republic of Kazakhstan. \n19 The Committee on Statistics of Republic of Kazakhstan calculates Short-term Economic Indicator based on the \nchange  in  output  indices  for  the  basic  sectors:  agriculture,  industry,  construction,  trade,  transport  and \ncommunications. The share of these industries in GDP is over 60% \n20 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n21 Appropriate renewable technologies such as deep- and/or shallow-ground geothermal, solar hot water, waste heat \nrecovery from industries and municipal sewage plants, and curtailed wind-based electric boilers will be selected \nduring implementation of the TA project. \n ", "4  \n \n14.  Output 3: Public\u2013Private Partnership framework in heat supply sector developed. \nConsultant will prepare policy recommendation to establish sound framework of Public\u2013Private \nPartnership in heat supply sector offering opportunities for increased participation of the private \nsector. \n \n15.  Output 4: International practices for heat supply systems disseminated. Consultant \nwill  conduct  extensive  capacity  building  activities  on  renewable  heat  technologies  and  the \napplicable policy mechanisms will be provided to the Ministry of Energy and Akimats.  At least \ntwo workshops will be organized for the main stakeholders, including members of Parliament to \n(i) share best practices from other countries and discuss the draft concept Law on Heat Supply, \nand (ii) present the draft Law on Heat Supply before submitting it to the government and \nParliament. These workshops will include public consultations. This approach will substantially \nincrease the effectiveness of the TA project. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,550,000, of which (i) $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility22 and (ii) \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund, and both administered by ADB.23 The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, workshop facilities, logistics and \nadministrative support, and other in-kind contributions. The value of the government contribution \nis estimated to account for 3.3% of the total TA cost. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA, including selection, supervision, and evaluation of consultants. \nThe MOE will guide and coordinate project implementation. A coordination unit at the MOE will \nbe responsible for coordinating the TA, including liaising with policymakers and stakeholders; \nproviding data; supporting consultants with logistical support; and working with the consultant in \norganizing workshops. A consultant will organize the workshops in coordination with the MOE \nand ADB. The consultant will also lead all TA-financed goods to be procured in line with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). All disbursements under the TA will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as \namended from time to time). Funds under CEFPF resources will be front-loaded or utilized first. \n \n18.  ADB will engage a consulting firm consisting of international technical and legal specialists \nas well as national experts using the quality-and cost-based selection method, with a 90:10 \nquality\u2013cost ratio. This approach will prioritize the quality of the consultants as the tasks require \nspecialized knowledge of heat supply systems, energy economics, policy making, and law. ADB \nwill engage the consultants and carry out procurement following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated staff instructions.24 ADB will engage any \nconsulting position identified at a later stage through individual consultant selection. \n \n19.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n \n22 Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n23 All expenditure items listed in the present report are eligible under their respective implementation guidelines. \n24 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n \n ", "5 \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  September 2020\u2013August 2022 \nperiod \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Energy  \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB as per the ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nFirm: Quality- and  Consulting firm  $1,454,000.00 \ncost-based selection   \nInternational: 28 \nperson-months \n \nNational: 57 \nperson-months \nIndividuals: Resource  International  $10,000.00 \nperson recruitment  and national: up \nto 10 persons \nand up to 10 \ndays each \nProcurementa  Goods will be procured by the consultants and will be turned \nover to the executing agency upon completion of the \nTA project. \nShopping  Equipments  $5,000.00 \nAdvance Contracting   Consulting firm will be selected using advance contracting \nmethod. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from \ntime to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Assets procured under TA funds will be turned over to the \narrangement upon TA  executing agency upon TA completion.  \ncompletion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance, TBD = to be determined. \na Procurement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.
