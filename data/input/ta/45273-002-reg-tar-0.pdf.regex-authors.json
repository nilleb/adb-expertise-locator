INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  brick  manufacturing  process  is  energy  intensive  and  is  a  major  source  of \ngreenhouse gas emissions and fine particulate pollution in Bangladesh. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) has provided financial intermediary loans equivalent to $50 million in local currency \nto support the construction of more energy-efficient and environmentally superior brick kilns.1 As \na part of the loans processing commitment, a capacity development technical assistance (TA) \nproject  will  complement  the  lending  facility  and  support  a  comprehensive  brick  sector \ndevelopment program in Bangladesh.2 During the ADB TA fact finding mission, the Government \nof Bangladesh concurred with the impact, outcome, outputs, and implementation agreements, \ncost and financing arrangements, and consultant terms of reference. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Promoting energy efficiency and environmental sustainability is a major component of \nBangladesh\u2019s sixth five year plan (2011\u20132015). However, continuous economic growth and \nrising industrial activities have led to an increased consumption of carbon-based fuels and a \ndoubling of per capita carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions from 40 tons in 1990 to 80 tons in 2008.4 \n2\nIn urban centers, the air quality has become extremely poor. A 2011 report indicated that, during \nthe dry season from November to April when industrial activities were the highest, Dhaka\u2019s PM  \n10\nand PM  levels were up to 250 \u03bcg/m3 and 165 \u03bcg/m3 respectively.5 These figures far exceeded \n2.5\nthe World Health Organization air quality standards of PM <20 \u03bcg/m3 and PM <10 \u03bcg/m3. \n10 2.5\nBrick kilns around Dhaka contributed to the most fine particulate pollution in the city, more than \nvehicle exhaust and road dust combined.6  \n \n3.  Brick  manufacturing  is  a  major  business  sector  in  Bangladesh.  There  are  4,880 \nbrickfields throughout the country (footnote 6). Together, they contribute to about 1% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP), or $245 million (2010).7 Among the six available types of brick kiln,8 \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans to the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  Financing  Brick  Kiln  Efficiency  Improvement  Project.  Manila  (Loans \n2865/2866-BAN). The loans were approved on 10 May 2012 by the ADB Board of Directors. These loans are \nintended to establish a credit facility of $50 million equivalent in local currency at Bangladesh Bank (central bank) \nfor  relending  to  participating  financial  intermediaries  for  the  construction  of  more  energy-efficient  and \nenvironmentally superior brick kilns.  \n2  The proposed TA project was not attached to the ADB loans 2865/2866-BAN. TA approval in Bangladesh is \nsubject to the government\u2019s technical proposal process, which is time consuming, while the financial intermediary \nloans are not subject to such a process; in order to conclude the loan negotiations before 1 April 2012 to avoid \nADB maturity-based pricing, the government requested that ADB separate the loans and the TA processing. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 October 2012. \n4  T.

These are key measures of air pollution. M.A. Rouf et al. 2011. Trend of Particulate \nMatter PM 2.5 and PM 10 in Dhaka City. Bangladesh Journal and Scientific and industrial Research. Dhaka. \n6  World  Bank.  2011.  Introducing  Energy-efficient  Clean  Technologies  in  the  Brick  Sector  of  Bangladesh. \nWashington, DC.  \n7  Brick sector size data are from footnote 6. The GDP figure is based on a purchasing power parity measure: ADB. \n2011. Key Indicators. Manila (pp 161). \n8  The six basic designs in the order of their energy efficiency are (i) bull\u2019s trench kiln, (ii) fixed chimney kiln (FCK), (iii) \nimproved zigzag kiln, (iv) vertical shaft brick kiln (VSBK), (v) hybrid Hoffman kiln, and (vi) tunnel kiln. The bull\u2019s \ntrench kiln is the least energy efficient and most polluting, and the tunnel kiln is the most energy efficient and the \nleast polluting. \n ", "2  \n92% of the 4,880 brickfields use the highly polluting fixed chimney kilns (FCKs) (footnote 6). \nMore energy-efficient improved zigzag kilns, vertical shaft brick kilns (VSBKs), hybrid Hoffman \nkilns (HHKs), and tunnel kilns are rare. This is mostly due to the lack of a comprehensive brick \nsector road map and development plan. As a result, the brick sector is poorly regulated and ill-\ninformed  of  the  latest  technologies.  Instead  of  a  small  number  of  highly  efficient  modern \nbrickfields, a large number of unqualified small businesses operate on the back of outmoded \ntechnologies,  severe  industrial  pollution,  and  poor  labor  standards.  Without  new  energy \nefficiency solutions, at the current annual production volume of 17 billion bricks and a demand \ngrowth rate at about 8% per year, the brick sector will continue to emit at least 9.8 million tons of \nCO  and 170 billion \u03bcg/m3 of particulate pollution.9  \n2\n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n4.  The impact of the TA is improved environmental conditions in Bangladesh, measured by \na reduction in greenhouse gas and fine particulate pollution from the brick sector. The outcome \nof  the  TA  is  expedited  brick  sector  modernization,  measured  by  a  higher  than  expected \nreduction of FCKs and construction of modern and energy-efficient brick kilns.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n5.  To improve the brick sector\u2019s energy efficiency, the Ministry of Environment and Forests \n(MOEF) issued a directive on 15 July 2010, requesting that all FCKs cease to exist from \nSeptember 2013 and environmental clearance favor more energy-efficient improved zigzag kilns, \nVSBKs, and HHKs.10 ADB loans 2865/2866-BAN complement this government directive by \nproviding targeted finance to build energy-efficient kiln replacement capacity to facilitate the \nphase-out of FCKs. The TA will further complement the loans by (i) creating a long-term brick \nsector development road map, with accompanying sector policy strategy, and action plans; (ii) \nenhancing market awareness of more energy-efficient brick kilns; (iii) supporting and facilitating \nADB loans effective implementation; and (iv) promoting research and development of advanced \nnew building materials. Since the World Bank, United Nations Development Programme, and \nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit are actively involved in development \nof Bangladesh\u2019s brick sector, the TA will coordinate with the ongoing and planned brick sector \nassistance programs to share resources and avoid duplication of efforts. In addition, the TA \nconsultants will work toward the creation of a joint-donor supported Bangladesh national brick \ntechnical and information center (the brick center) as a one-stop-shop to meet the brick sector\u2019s \ndevelopment needs. The TA is a critical part of the ADB loans (footnote 1) implementation \narrangement.11 TA activities are as follows: \n \n6.  Government delivers a long-term brick sector policy, strategy, and action plan for \nadoption. The TA will cover a comprehensive range of capacity development activities to help \ngovernment agencies, including the MOEF and Department of Environment (DOE), to develop a \n                                                 \n9  S.

Manila which has a similar brick sector financing component. For detailed information \non the coordination of the loans 2865/2866 and PSOD Loan 8024, please see the report and recommendation of \nthe President (footnote 1). \n ", "  3\nbrick  sector  policy,  strategy,  and  action  plan.12 The  TA  component  will  provide  training  to \ngovernment officials on (i) international best practices in brick sector development; (ii) the \nenvironmental, technical, and commercial benefits of advanced brick kiln technologies; (iii) \ninnovations in low energy-intensive construction materials; and (iv) preparation of a long-term \nbrick sector development roadmap. The TA consultant will help to facilitate the government\u2019s \nstakeholder consultation process and ensure government ownership. The effectiveness of this \nTA component will be measured against the government\u2019s adoption of proposed sector policy, \nstrategy, and action plan. In addition, the TA will assess, as a part of the long-term brick sector \ndevelopment road map, the likelihood of establishing a joint-donor funded national brick center, \nwhich could also ensure the sustainability of the subsequent brick sector development work and \nserve as the TA\u2019s exit strategy.  \n \n7.  Market  awareness  for  energy-efficient  brick  kilns  and  provision  of  business \nsupport to subborrowers improved. The TA will provide intense campaigns on the advanced, \nmore energy-efficient brick kiln technologies to (i) existing FCK owners, (ii) potential energy-\nefficient  brick  kiln  investors,  and  (iii)  other  stakeholders  including  staff  from  government \nagencies and financial institutions. The goal is to raise critically needed product awareness on \nthe cleaner technologies\u2019 environmental, technical, and commercial benefits, thereby enticing \nmarket demand for funds. Successful ADB-funded pilot projects will be promoted to further \ndemonstrate their superiorities. Workshops, conferences, and an internet web portal will provide \nthe  platform  for  disseminating  financial,  operational,  and  technical  information  on  energy-\nefficient brick kilns.13 Finally, the TA consultants could provide business support to prospective \nsubborrowers, assisting them in preparing a business plan to access market funding. The \neffectiveness of this TA component will be measured against the pace at which the ADB funds \nare disbursed.   \n \n8.  Effective ADB loans implementation. The TA will strengthen the capacities of the ADB \nloans\u2019 implementing agency, Bangladesh Bank, and some participating financial intermediaries \nto ensure smooth project implementation.14 The TA will provide on-the-job training to (i) support \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  screening  and  categorizations;  (ii)  ensure  review  and \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s environment and social safeguards, gender action plan, core labor \nstandards, procurement requirements, and prohibited investment activities; and (iii) review loans \ndisbursement and market conditions and revise on-lending terms.15 Technical consultants will \nalso provide operational support, including through the technical support desk located at DOE, \nto energy-efficient brick kiln owners, with preference given to operators of the most energy-\nefficient and modern tunnel kiln and HHK and those who have successfully obtained funds from \nthe ADB credit facility. The technical consultants will provide training to DOE staff on the \nverification of energy-efficient brick kiln design standards.16 Technical and operational manuals \nwill be prepared to ensure TA sustainability. The effectiveness of this TA component will be \nmeasured against the level of compliance with the stated subloan requirements. Finally, since \nthe brick sector modernization process will inevitably lead to the loss of livelihoods for some \n                                                 \n12 The World Bank\u2019s clean air and sustainable environment project is working on the improvement of existing brick \nsector legislation. The ADB TA will not cover the same area, to avoid the duplication of efforts. \n13 The TA intends to closely coordinate with development partners working in development of Bangladesh\u2019s brick \nsector whenever a workshop or seminar is proposed, and join forces or combine resources if possible. \n14 Participating financial intermediaries are selected based on the eligibility criteria specified in the ADB loans\u2019 Project \nAdministration Manual (footnote 1). \n15 Refer to the compliance sections of the report and recommendation of the President (footnote 1). \n16 The World Bank will provide the design standards for improved zigzag kilns and VSBKs. For HHKs and tunnel \nkilns, or in the absence of any reliable technical design standards, the consultants will train the DOE staff on the \napproval of funding applications in accordance with international best practices that demonstrate equivalent energy \nand technical efficiency. \n ", "4  \ninefficient and poorly capitalized brickfields, the TA will help enhance the DOE\u2019s capacity to \ndevelop an alternative livelihood program, in coordination with other line ministries, to alleviate \nthe potential social pressure. \n \n9.  Research  and  development  in  advanced  building  materials  promoted.  The \nextraction of fertile topsoil (up to 20 centimeters of the upper-most layer of soil) for brick-making \nis a common industrial practice and a major environmental hazard. Even with an improved \ntechnical efficiency, brick kilns will continue to use up the existing topsoil to meet the rising \ndemand for bricks, affecting the ecosystems and agricultural production. The solution is to \npromote perforated and hollow bricks that consume less clay, and develop alternative building \nmaterials such as compressed bricks made from fly ash and other solid waste. Abundant river \nbasin sediments could also be developed into alternative construction materials to replace the \nbricks. The TA will coordinate with development partners including the World Bank, the United \nNations  Development  Programme,  and  GIZ,  to  enhance  the  DOE\u2019s  capacity  to  promote \nperforated and hollow bricks, and develop a research and development program for alternative \nand low energy-intensive building materials. This TA component should eventually be integrated \ninto the work plan of the proposed national brick center. The effectiveness of this TA component \nwill be measured against the pace at which alternative brick materials are developed and \nadopted.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, all of which will be financed on a grant basis from \nthe Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund17 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, \nand administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office \naccommodation, staff from ministries and departments to benefit from the consultants\u2019 capacity \nbuilding, establishment of a designated web portal for information dissemination, organization of \nworkshops  and  meetings,  facilitation  of  policy  and  regulatory  approvals,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The TA executing agency will be the MOEF. The MOF will also support the preparation \nand submission of the brick sector policy, strategy, and action plan. The implementing agency \nwill be the DOE, which will carry out the day-to-day TA administration. In addition, the DOE will \nverify brick kiln technical design and monitor associated environmental benefits (e.g., reduction \nof CO  emissions and fine particulate pollution). Bangladesh Bank\u2019s Agricultural Credit and \n2\nFinancial Inclusion Department will be a part of the implementation arrangement to enhance its \ncapacity in administering ADB-funded projects. The MOEF, Bangladesh Bank, and the DOE \nhave committed to provide dedicated counterpart staff and resources. A project director will be \nselected by the MOEF to head the project management unit, which will be based in the DOE. \nThe TA steering committee will comprise Bangladesh Bank, the DOE, the MOEF, and the Bank \nand Financial Institutions Division of Ministry of Finance. The TA will be implemented for 24 \nmonths during December 2012\u2013December 2014. \n \n12.  ADB will be responsible for the recruitment of consultants. Four international consultants \n(36 person-months on an intermittent basis) and five national consultants (44 person-months on \nan intermittent basis) will be recruited through a firm. The consulting firm will be selected \nthrough a quality and cost-based selection method, based on a simplified technical proposal \n                                                 \n17 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n ", "  5\nwith a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with \nits Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements \nunder the TA grant will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). TA fund recipients will follow the specific \nClean Energy Financing Partnership Facility implementation guidelines. Procurement of goods \nwill follow ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), and any \nequipment purchased under this TA will be handed over to the MOEF at the closure of the TA.18 \nThe DOE and Bangladesh Bank are expected to provide in-kind support in the form of office \naccommodation,  counterpart  staff  resources,  internet  web  portal  hosting,  facilitation  of \nstakeholder consultation, facilitation of the submissions and adoptions of vision documents, and \nany other support to best implement the TA. \n \n13.  The effectiveness of the expected outcome will be reflected in a decline in the number of \npolluting  FCKs  from  2013.  The  evaluation  of  the  expected  outputs  and  outcome  will  be \ndisseminated  through  the  web  portals  hosted  by  the  DOE  and  Bangladesh  Bank.  The \nsustainability  of  the  TA  will  be  achieved  through  enhanced  institutional  capacity  and  the \nproposed national brick center for continued information and knowledge sharing. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 to the Government \nof Bangladesh to be financed on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund under the \nClean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for Supporting Brick Sector Development Program, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n18 The  equipment  procured  under  the  TA  will  include  office  equipment  unable  to  be  accommodated  by  the \ngovernment counterpart agencies, and rentals of conference and workshop facilities during the course of TA \nimplementation.
