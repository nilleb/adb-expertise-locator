INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Both  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  and  the  Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS)  strategies  are  focused  on  trade  facilitation,  including  improving \nborder  trade  and  supporting  regional  economic  cooperation.  Both  agreements  note  the \nimportance  of  developing  economic  corridors,  which  include  key  border  locations  as  an \nessential component. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) continues to actively support both \norganizations under its regional cooperation mandate.  \n \n2.  The People's Republic of China (PRC) Country Partnership Strategy for 2008\u201320101 \nprovides for continuing institutional reforms in the financial sector and the development of small \nand  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  as  well  as  for  support  to  regional  integration.  The \nMongolia Country Operations Business Plan, 2009\u201320122, notes the importance of support to \nprivate sector development and trade engagement with the PRC under regional cooperation. \nBoth governments have requested that ADB undertake activities to improve at-border SME \ntrade with neighboring countries, and in particular explore new financing options for traders. \n \n3.  This regional policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to address weaknesses in \nfinancing options and trade facilitation for SME at-border trade builds on current and previous \nwork  on  trade  facilitation,  infrastructure  development  in  border  areas,  and  private  sector \nparticipation. Fact-finding missions visited Mongolia from 14 to 17 February 2009 and the PRC \non 1\u20133 April 2009 to determine the objectives, scope, and implementation arrangements for the \nTA.3 Participation by Viet Nam was confirmed during a regional cooperation meeting in April \n2009. The technical assistance (TA) design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Trade is an increasingly important and profitable activity for small businesses in East \nAsia and is critical for equitable growth. SMEs account for more than 90% of the total number of \nfirms, more than 66% of labor employment, and a substantial part of total output in CAREC and \nGMS countries. In particular, trade at the land borders between Kazakhstan, Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic, Mongolia, the PRC and Viet Nam is significant and growing.  \n \n5.  Countries in the region are increasingly developing cross-border infrastructure, such as \nthe ADB-financed Asian Highway 14, which connects Ha Noi to Lao Cai on the Viet Nam\u2013PRC \nborder. The Inner Mongolia transport and trade corridor is under construction to link the northern \nPRC to Mongolia and the Russian Federation. Additional land links are being constructed in \nCentral Asia and India. As pan-Asian transport networks continue to expand, trade opportunities \nand trade volumes are expected to grow significantly in the medium term. Surveys by Hong \nKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in mid-2008 showed that SMEs had buoyant business \nexpectations, in particular regarding trade between the PRC and other Asian neighbors. While \nthe global financial crisis and related downturns in demand are likely to continue to dampen \nexport options to Europe and the US, the projections for Asia as a region and for post-global \ncrisis recovery suggest that the internal regional market still has scope for development. In \nparticular, trade between the PRC and Mongolia and the PRC and Viet Nam may benefit from \nimprovements in the efficiency of SME border traders. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 11 May 2009. \n ", "2     \n \n6.  The  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  in  southwest  PRC  has  seen  significant \ngrowth in trade with the three neighboring provinces of northern Viet Nam. This area was poor \nand less-developed, but since 1999 its inherent comparative advantages have resulted in a \nflourishing border trade. There are large discrepancies in statistics, as the scope of trade being \nmeasured is not uniformly defined; some reports quote Guangxi\u2013Association of Southeast Asian \nNations trade, while others focus on Guangxi\u2013Viet Nam trade, including sea lanes. Nonetheless, \nland-based trade across this border probably totaled several hundred million dollars in 2006, \nand has been increasing at 50% per year in recent years.  \n \n7.  A significant proportion of the cross-border trade at Lao Cai is small in scale. In 2008, \nexporters to the PRC could bring in 3,000 Yuan (CNY) worth of goods per day tax free. This \nfigure is set to be lifted to 5,000 or 7,000 CNY per day. Typically, the trader or an employee \nrides with the load of goods across the border, and goods are paid for in cash on delivery. The \nyuan is the dominant currency, accounting for 95% of all payments, with the Vietnamese dong \nbeing used for less than 5%. Clearly, paying for goods with large amounts of cash is inefficient. \nHowever, little information exists on the volume of fund flows or the financing needs of traders. \n \n8.  Evidence suggests that efforts are being made to improve border financial services. \nSome traders make payments across the border using Western Union in sums of up to $5,000. \nIn the beginning of 2008 the Agricultural Bank of China tried to set up a system of electronic \npayments, with Vietnamese traders setting up accounts in a bank in the PRC and making \npayments from that account. While this may be convenient for individual purchases, it does not \naddress the problem of how an initial large deposit is to be made to set up such accounts.  \n \n9.  Mongolia  and  PRC  share  a  border  of  over  4,600  miles,  and  the  PRC  has  been \nMongolia's largest trading partner for many years. In 2007, over $2 billion worth of goods was \ntraded between the two countries, and trade has been growing significantly, as evidenced by \ninclusion of trade discussions during the June 2008 state visit of the PRC\u2019s Vice President Xi \nJinping to the country. Approximately half of the foreign investment in Mongolia originated in the \nPRC and, while investments focus on mining, niche agricultural and livestock products are \nemerging, along with trade opportunities for the largely small producers of such goods and \nservices. The major border crossing for trade between the two countries is Zamyn Uud\u2013Erlian.   \n \n10.  There is significant poverty along the border between Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, and \nthe border area between Viet Nam and the southern PRC has high trade volumes from SMEs. \nBoth border areas can significantly benefit from increased SME trade activity. Growing trade \noffers income opportunities to small-scale land-border traders. Appropriate financial services \ncan increase standards of living and help decrease poverty levels in these and adjacent areas. \nHowever, the information costs of determining the size and potential of this market has so far \nbeen a barrier to service development. \n \n11.  Published statistics for cross-border trade are scanty and can be misleading, for three \nreasons: (i) the extent of area of the trade is rarely mentioned, and published trade data reports \nusually do not indicate if information pertains to national or local-level trade; (ii) there is little \ndata to distinguish small trade by day traders or SMEs (who are in possible need of improved \nelectronic transaction facilities) from sophisticated trade by large companies that already have \nmodern remittance channels. Note that some barge trade, which follows the coast around the \nGulf  of  Beibu  between  Viet  Nam  and  Guangxi,  may  also  be  currently  restricted  to  cash \npayments; and (iii) trade is often not recorded in official data, because line items are too small, \nare uncategorized, or are not recorded for other reasons. Accordingly, there is little information \navailable to help identify and address blockages to trade efficiency for smaller traders. \n ", "  3 \n \n12.  SMEs are highly creative and adaptable firms, and by taking advantage of changing \nmarket environments can provide crucial industrial linkages for broad-based and sustainable \ndevelopment. However, SMEs in particular have difficulties (i) accessing information flows to \nenable adjustments in their production, volume, pricing and even goods produced or services \nprovided;  (ii)  financing  border  trade,  with  most  SME  trade  being  conducted  in  cash  with \nattendant risks (e.g., security, corruption, and exchange rate losses); and (iii) entering markets, \nas SME border transits can take time and be overly complex. Observations indicate that in \nlocations such as the PRC\u2013Viet Nam and PRC\u2013Mongolia borders, large volumes of cash move \nacross  borders  daily,  suggesting  that  formal  systems  for  remittances  and  transfers  are \ninadequate. This is particularly true for day traders and very small businesses, which have a \nsignificant role in both trade and poverty reduction agendas.  \n \n13.  Government and donor attention has centered on the infrastructure needs of trade and, \nto a lesser extent, the improvement of customs transit of goods and people. ADB has, over the \nlast two decades, provided significant support to SME development within countries across \nregions,4 and completed research on various regional trade barriers (e.g., energy, environment, \ntransport, tourism and general barriers).5 Improvements in regional trade integration and border \ntrade are incorporated in ADB\u2019s ongoing regional work under CAREC and GMS, but have so far \nbeen  limited  to  improvements  in  day  passes,  setting  up  of  selected  border  markets,  and \nimprovements in customs clearance. Until now, no specific studies have been undertaken to \nprovide information on cross-border trade of SMEs and small border traders in terms of their \nmarket information and financing arrangements, and to identify reforms to facilitate such trade. \nThe proposed TA will address gaps in knowledge and provide suggestions on improving SME \naccess to information flows, faster border transit, and financing arrangements. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The impact of this TA will be improved trade efficiency in the region resulting in a \nmeasurable increase in trade flows, with SME border trade values increasing by 15% by 2014. \nIts outcome will be increased depth and diversity of information and financial services available \nto SME traders, to be measured by the availability of at least two new financial products for \nborder traders and the expansion of credit volumes for SMEs by up to 20% by 2012. This \noutcome will be due to (i) better information on the potential client market of SME border traders \nin terms of their business activities and needs; (ii) removal of policy and regulatory barriers, as \nappropriate  and  negotiated  by  governments;  and  (iii)  introduction  of  new  financing  and \ninformation products by financial institutions and others in value chains who are providing \nservices to SME border traders. The study results will be discussed with the participating \ncountries, possibly as part of the regional cooperation meetings that take place on a regular \nbasis. \n \n15.  The proposed TA will provide additional information for SME traders and policy makers \non (i) market access; (ii) trading options; and (ii) the efficiency, security and transparency of \nborder cash flows and related financial services for their business and trading arrangements.

Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.   The first output of the TA is an analysis of a dataset created from surveys of key border \nsites. The TA team will (i) agree with key officials on the selection of sites and brief teams and \nrepresentatives of SMEs and financial service providers in the areas on the TA objectives; (ii) \npropose a suitable methodology for the survey and confirm this with ADB and key stakeholders; \n(iii) design, review with stakeholders, pretest, and deliver a survey in appropriate languages; (iv) \nenter, clean, and complete a dataset based on the surveys; and (v) analyze the dataset and \npresent the results to stakeholders. The dataset will include basic SME information such as \nnumber of SMEs, nature of business activities, items being traded, use of transport and financial \nservices, sources and uses of market information, and issues and gaps in information and \nfinancing. A technical note describing the methodology will be completed. The survey dataset \nand analysis of findings will be provided as another technical note. The study outline is in \nAppendix 4. \n \n17.   The  second  output  will  be  recommendations  for  policy  and  regulatory  changes \nnecessary to increase SME access to financing. The TA team will analyze current policies and \nregulations on both sides of each border town (both in theory and practice), hold discussions \nwith public and private sector agents regarding regulation issues and options, and use the \nsurvey  results  to  devise  and  present  practical  recommendations  for  changes  in  financing \narrangements to be negotiated among stakeholders. These will be presented as a policy brief \nand discussed in workshops. \n \n18.   The third output will be recommendations supported by banks, financial institutions, and \nother  SME  service  providers  on  new  financial  product  options.  The  TA  team  will  analyze \ncurrently available financial and information services on both sides of the border in each border \ntown, discuss regulation issues and options with public and private sector agents, and use the \nsurvey results to present practical recommendations for a range of potential financial products \nfor consideration by financial institutions. It is anticipated that the ongoing dialogue among the \ncoordination committees, SMEs, and financial institutions will encourage the implementation of \nthese recommendations by those providing finance to SME traders. \n \n19.   The  final  output  will  be  recommendations  on  policy  and  regulatory  changes  in \nnonfinancial areas to enhance trade efficiency and information access for SMEs. The TA team \nwill assess constraints not related to financing, including institutional issues and other problems \nemerging from the SME survey and interviews of other stakeholders. It will develop options to \naddress  these  issues,  including  options  for  pilot  testing  of  proposed  changes.  Summary \nrecommendations  will  be  developed  and  workshops  conducted  to  review  these \nrecommendations with stakeholders. The recommendations will be presented as a policy brief \nand  can  be  discussed  in  suitable  regional  groups  such  as  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic \nCooperation SME Forum, the CAREC Business Forum, and the GMS Business Forum. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000 to be funded by the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration  Fund  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Financing  Partnership \nFacility.6  The TA will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem of consultants, all field survey, \n                                                \n6  Established by ADB. \n ", "  5 \n \ndata entry, and analysis costs, as well as training, workshops, publications, and miscellaneous \nexpenses. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The TA will have an implementation period of 30 months (1 November 2009 to 28 April \n2012),  with  the  first  6  months  for  consultant  selection,  and  the  remaining  24  months  for \nimplementation.  It  will  be  executed  by  ADB  and managed  by the  East  Asia  Department's \nFinancial  Sector,  Public  Management  and  Regional  Cooperation  Division.  Work  will  be \nundertaken in full cooperation with PRC, Mongolia, and Viet Nam government customs and \nfinancial regulators, local government offices, and border entities as appropriate. No objection \nletters for the TA will be obtained from all three participating countries before work commences. \nEach participating country will be requested to use the existing local cross-border coordination \ncommittees as vehicles for collaboration with the TA.7  The committees will coordinate with the \nconsulting  team  and  ADB  regarding  (i)  survey  methods  and  approaches;  (ii)  persons  and \ninstitutions to interview and consult on cross-border trade issues; (iii) review of draft reports and \nrecommendations, and the setting up of seminars for discussions on draft findings; and (iv) \nimplementation  by  the  governments  of  suggested  reform  measures,  and  monitoring  of \nimprovements to and in SMEs and financial institutions in keeping with the project's objectives. \nThe Financial Sector, Public Management and Regional Cooperation Division will coordinate as \nappropriate  with  the  ADB  Southeast  Asia  Department  and  the  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment regarding areas of mutual interest. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line \nwith the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.8  \n \n22.  A consulting consortium made up of firms, universities, and/or research institutions will \nbe selected and engaged by ADB under the quality and cost-based selection method (with a \n80/20 quality to cost ratio) to conduct the TA activities in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  consortium  will  have \ndemonstrated capacity in trade and SME field studies and policy reform. The consultant team \nwill  consist  of  international  experts  in  SME  financial  services,  survey  methodology  and \nimplementation, and border trade policy, especially on the smaller end of the market. National \nexperts will be engaged for SME finance, cross-border trade operations, trade logistics, and \nstatistics. Local field teams will be engaged by the consortium for field survey activities on a per-\nsurvey delivered basis, with field checks, consistent with the approach used in other ADB \nstudies. A project coordinator based at ADB headquarters will be recruited as an individual \nconsultant by ADB to oversee the implementation of the TA and support statistical and analytic \nwork.  Consultant  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  3.  Equipment  (computer,  printer, \nfax/scanner, photocopier at each border site) will be purchased by the consortium under ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) for use during the TA, and will \nbe turned over to the coordinating committees on completion.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 financed on a \ngrant basis, for Enhancing Border Trade Services and Rules for Small and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2006.
