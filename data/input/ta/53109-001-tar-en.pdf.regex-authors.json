The project will modernize prioritized components of the Yovon irrigation and drainage \n(I&D) system. It will increase the capacities of the Agency for Land Reclamation and Irrigation \n(ALRI) and of water users associations (WUAs) for infrastructure management, and increase \nwater use efficiency and productivity. Women farmers will be targeted in all activities.1 \n \n2.  Impact and outcome. The impact of the project is food security and people\u2019s access to \ngood quality nutrition increased. It is aligned with the  National Development Strategy of the \nRepublic of Tajikistan for the Period up to 2030. The outcome of the project is climate and disaster \nresilience, water productivity, and income of male and female farmers increased in selected areas \nof the Yovon I&D system. The project will increase climate and disaster resilience, water and \nagricultural productivity, and farmers\u2019 incomes through three outputs.  \n \n3.  Output  1:  Climate-  and  disaster-resilient  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure \nmodernized. This will modernize, main, secondary, and tertiary systems to increase reliability \nand flexibility in irrigation service delivery, comprising (i) modernized and seismic shock-proofed \nmain  and  branch  canals  and  associated  structures;  (ii)  provision  of  energy-efficient  pump \ninstallations;  (iii) erosion  mitigation,  stabilization,  and  reclamation  of  major  gullies;  and \n(iv) upgraded drainage buried pipe and collector ditch system, and modernized buried pipe \npressurized tertiary irrigation systems with volumetric metering. \n \n4.  Output 2: Climate-adaptive and gender-responsive management and operation of \nirrigation and drainage systems strengthened. This output aims at increased climate and \ndisaster resilience by supporting adaptive management and operation of the modern I&D system. \nIt will include (i) establishment of a single system management entity to manage irrigation water \ncontrol and remote monitoring systems, and enhancement of farmers\u2019 resilience to climate \nchange; (ii) creation of a union of WUAs, with women comprising at least 10% of the leadership, \nto provide improved services to WUAs and farmers; (iii) operationalization of a cashless payment \nsystem with volumetric metering and asset inventory for the core project area to enable flexible \non-demand irrigation; (iv) introduction of modern climate-smart agriculture and irrigation practices \nwith improved land management and conservation techniques for farmers; and (v) adoption of \nclimate-adaptive labor- and water-efficient water application systems for high-value crops to be \nmanaged by women. \n \n5.  Output  3:  Policy  for  sustainable  management  strengthened.  This  will  include \n(i) development of options for climate-adaptive and sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) \nfunding, including formulation of a revised tariff structure; and (ii) development and adoption of a \ngender strategy for the ALRI and WUAs to strengthen women\u2019s access to land and improve \nfemale participation in water management. \n \n6.  The proposed project is estimated to cost $35.2 million. Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual.2 \n \n \n \n \n1  About 6,700 farmers, of whom 12% are female, will benefit from improved water service delivery, energy savings, \nand application of climate-smart technologies in I&D. \n2  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the report and \nrecommendation of the President). \n \n ", "2 \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n7.  Tajikistan  has  limited  financial  resources  for  operating  and  maintaining  existing \ninfrastructure assets. This is particularly pertinent to water resources infrastructure, specifically \nI&D, which contributes to the agricultural production and rural livelihoods of 73% of Tajikistan\u2019s \npopulation. Most of the country\u2019s debt is in the form of concessional foreign loans (70% of total \nsovereign debt). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other international financing institutions \nare closely engaging with Tajikistan. This is to build capacity and introduce good governance and \nfinancial management practices to ensure efficient use of public funds and to mobilize additional \ndomestic revenues. Promoting projects\u2019 sustainability and addressing immediate coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic effects are supported by ADB. This includes ADB\u2019s $50 million \nCOVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program grant for Tajikistan, which was \napproved on 18 June 2020 and active until 31 December 2021.3 It is equally important that \nadequate maintenance of water resources infrastructure and underlying financial sustainability \nmeasures are systematically and adequately addressed. \n \n8.  Addressing the financial sustainability of water resources infrastructure requires a broader \nperspective than the proposed project, which focuses on the modernization and O&M of the \nYovon I&D system. The technical assistance (TA) addresses the sustainable financing and O&M \nof I&D systems in Tajikistan at the national level and at the ALRI, thereby providing an opportunity \nto address the vicious circle of accruing debts, neglecting O&M, and increasing costs of required \nrepairs and modernization. The TA will include experiences gained in the Vakhsh river basin \nunder the proposed project and the Pyanj river basin project.4 The TA will provide an opportunity \nto significantly expand the insights gained and benefits developed under the project. \n \n9.  The COVID-19 pandemic is having a severe economic impact on Tajikistan with trade and \ntransportation disruptions and falls in remittances and government revenues. According to the \nInternational Monetary Fund, Tajikistan's debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio reached to \n48.1.0% in 2020. The International Monetary Fund projects the debt-to-GDP ratio to marginally \nincrease  up  to  48.5%  by  2025.5 Tajikistan's  debt  sustainability  depends  on  how  well  the \ngovernment manages its public debt. \n \n10.  The  Government  of  Tajikistan  plans  a  series  of  fiscal  adjustments  as  part  of \ncountercyclical fiscal policy, which may reduce budget availability for capital expenditures and \njeopardize financial sustainability of infrastructure investment due to further reduced budget \nallocation for the management, operation, and maintenance (MOM) of water resources assets. \nMOM allocations are historically insufficient. For example, it was observed in ADB\u2019s Water \nResources Management in Pyanj River Basin Project that the ALRI could not secure sufficient \nbudget for MOM, even after increasing irrigation service fees and its collection rate to nearly 90%.6 \n \n11.  For  better  allocation  and  management  of  limited  MOM  funds  and  for  operational \nsustainability  of  key  infrastructure  assets such  as  irrigation  systems, it  is  imperative  (i)  to \n \n3  ADB. 2020.

A digital AMS can also identify priority areas for capital allocation \nto minimize recurrent expenditure levels, maximize impact, and improve  budget allocations and \ncost recovery. \n \n12.  AMSs can be profitably piloted in the agriculture, natural resources, and rural development \nsector which accounts for about 22% of GDP and 39% of tax revenues. The bulk of agriculture \nrequires irrigation, and the institutions that manage it form a critical foundation.  The ALRI has \nconsistently accrued large debts to its suppliers and employees. In 2017, the ALRI\u2019s debt was \nabout $12 million. This was mostly for electricity charges and staff salaries. \n   \n13.  The ALRI\u2019s maintenance practices are largely reactive, addressing serious problems and \nsystem failures as they arise, rather than proactive and preventative. This results in rapid system \ndeterioration,  shorter  return  periods  for  system  modernization,  and  considerable  losses  in \nproductivity. The reactive maintenance and poor state of I&D systems is partly because of \nshortage of funds and the absence of a rational, data-based system to assess asset condition \nand optimize MOM. Modern AMSs are designed specifically to address these needs. \n \nA modern AMS, in conjunction with an asset cost assessment and a finance management system \n(i.e., an asset and financial management system [AFMS]), will help enhance debt sustainability. \nThis AFMS will support a shift to efficiency and productivity gains improved MOM resource \nallocation  and  mobilization,  better  rationalization  of  public  expenditures  and  improved \nopportunities for further domestic revenues generation, and other funding of MOM needs. This \nwill support overall public financial management and contribute to Tajikistan\u2019s quality of growth.  \n \n14.  The TA will help to improve the financial sustainability of the Yovon I&D system and that \nof the ALRI and the selected WUAs of the proposed project. It will contribute to ADB Strategy \n2030 operational priorities 5 (promoting rural development and food security) and 6 (strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity [of the ALRI]). \n \n15.  The TA will build on findings of the Operation and Maintenance Sustainability of Water \nResources Infrastructure TA project carried out in the Pyanj river basin (footnote 4). The TA will \nalso coordinate, to the extent possible, with other efforts to establish AFMS for irrigation projects \ninitiated by development partners, the ALRI, and the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n16.  The TA will support management and planning of O&M and financial and institutional \nsustainability of the Yovon I&D system operators and related institutions such as the ALRI and \nWUAs. The TA will have a pilot function at different relevant levels to be expanded or extrapolated \nto other comparable areas and systems in Tajikistan and possibly other Central Asian countries \nwith comparable I&D institutional setup, MOM, and financial constraints.  \n \n17.  The TA is coordinated with the ALRI and will build on the Pyanj river basin TA (footnote 6) \nand interventions by other major development partners. It will closely cooperate with the Yovon \nI&D main system service provider and WUAs as well as with the appropriate ALRI staff. The TA \nwill have two outputs (Table 1). \n \n \n \n \n ", "4 \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nMajor Outputs  Delivery Dates  Key Activities with Milestones \n1.
