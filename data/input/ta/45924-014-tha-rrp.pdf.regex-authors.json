THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  The 7.5 megawatt (MW) Theppana Wind Power Project is part of the long-term growth \nstrategy  of  Electricity  Generating  Public  Company  (EGCO),  which  emphasizes  expanding \ninvestments into renewable energy to strengthen its business in independent power generation \nin Thailand. With its recent acquisitions and projects currently under development, EGCO plans \nto increase its installed renewable energy capacity to over 300 MW by 2015.3 EGCO\u2019s strategy \naligns with the Renewable and Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2012\u20132021 approved by \nthe Government of Thailand in December 2011, which increased the target for wind power \ncapacity to 1,200 MW by 2021.4 As of January 2012, only 7.28 MW of wind power was installed \nand operating in the country. The plan sets out a target of generating 25% of primary energy \nfrom  renewable  sources  by  2021,    thereby  avoiding  76  million  tons  of  carbon  emissions \nannually. This will be the first Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing of a wind power project \nin Southeast Asia. It is working with EGCO on this project to establish a financing framework \nthat can be replicated for EGCO\u2019s larger 200 MW wind power project planned in 2013.  \n \n3.  The project is eligible for cofinancing from the ADB CTF.5 The Clean Technology Fund \nprovides concessional financing to support the rapid deployment of low-carbon technologies \nwith significant potential to reduce and avoid greenhouse gas emissions over the long term. It is \nadministered through multilateral development banks, including ADB, and is one of the largest \nfunds helping developing countries fill gaps in financing projects to mitigate climate change. The \nCTF Trust Fund Committee approved the allocation of $99.5 million for the CTF Thailand \nPrivate Sector Renewable Energy Program on 24 May 2012, to be utilized and administered by \nADB.6 The proposed project is the second private sector project in Thailand7 under the ADB \nCTF8 (approved and under due diligence), for a total allocation of $19 million to date. \n \n4.  As of June 2012, Thailand\u2019s installed power generation capacity was 31,525 MW. The \ncountry\u2019s electricity production depends heavily on conventional fuels, with 65% produced using \n                                                \n1  Financed by the Clean Technology Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  EGCO\u2019s currently operating installed capacity for renewable energy includes 9.9 MW generated from biomass and \n63 MW of solar.   \n4  The original target for wind power was set at 800 MW in 2007.  \n5  Climate Investment Funds. http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org. \n6  ADB Thailand Private Sector Renewable Energy Program approved by CTF Trust Fund Committee on 24 May \n2012 pursuant to the Financial Procedures Agreement entered into between ADB and the International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development as trustee of the Trust Fund for the Clean Technology Fund dated 18 March \n2010. \n7  The first private sector project identified under the ADB CTF is the Provincial Solar Power Project.   \n8  ADB. 2009.  Establishment of the ADB Clean Technology Fund and the ADB Strategic Climate Fund. Manila ", "2   \nnatural gas and 20% coal and lignite. Natural gas has traditionally provided Thailand with a \nreliable and low-cost source of energy, but growing demand and dwindling natural gas reserves \nfrom the Gulf of Thailand mean the country must diversify and secure alternative fuel sources \nfor power generation. Fortunately, Thailand has abundant renewable energy sources\u2014biomass, \nbiogas, mini-hydro, solar, and wind. Using these domestic sources of renewable energy can \nboost Thailand\u2019s energy security, save foreign exchange, and protect the country from global \nprice fluctuations.  \n \n5.  To  complement  its  renewable  energy  strategy,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  advocates \ndecentralized power generation mainly by supporting the country\u2019s small power producer (SPP) \nand very small power producer (VSPP) programs. The SPP program allows private developers \nto  build,  own,  and  operate  10\u201390  MW  power  projects  and  enter  into  power  purchase \nagreements (PPAs) with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). Under the \nVSPP  program,  producers  of  up to  10  MW may  sell  power to the Metropolitan  Electricity \nAuthority (MEA) or the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). Renewable energy SPPs and \nVSPPs are eligible for a feed-in tariff (or \u2015adder\u2016) in addition to the wholesale electricity price. As \nof March 2012, only three wind power VSPPs were connected to the grid, with a combined \ncapacity of 0.380 MW.   \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n2.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n6.  The borrower is Theppana Wind Farm Company, a special purpose project company \n90% owned by EGCO and 10% owned by the founder of Pro Ventum, an international wind \npower developer based in Germany.9  \n \n7.  EGCO is Thailand\u2019s first independent power producer and currently the second largest \nprivate power producer in the country. It was privatized by EGAT in 1992 and listed on the Stock \nExchange  of  Thailand  in  1995.  EGCO  is  owned  by  EGAT  (25.4%),  TEPDIA  Generating  \n(23.9%), and the public (50.7%).10  \n \n8.  The Pro Ventum Group is a German company founded in 1996 to develop wind power \nprojects in Europe. The Pro Ventum Group expanded into Asia and the Pacific in 2001 and into \nThailand in 2007. It has successfully developed 12 wind power projects in Australia, Germany, \nand Ireland with capacity ranging from 1.2 MW to 232 MW. With its expertise in planning, \ndeveloping, constructing, and operating wind farms, the Pro Ventum Group contributes early \nstage site development to the partnership.11  \n \n                                                \n9  The 10% is divided among Pro Ventum International (0.19%), Prograce Asia (8.81%), and J.R. Management \nCompany (1%), all owned by R. Zoller, the founder of Pro Ventum.    \n10 TEPDIA Generating is jointly owned 50% by Mitsubishi and Tokyo Electric Power Company. \n11 Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  ", "  3 \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n9.  The impact of the project will be to diversify Thailand's energy mix by adding renewable \nenergy capacity, thus helping the country progress toward its clean energy targets.12 To achieve \nsustainable long-term economic growth, Thailand is promoting alternative sources of energy \nsuch as wind for power generation and is beginning its transition to a low-carbon economy. \nWind energy is a clean and sustainable source of electricity that diversifies the country\u2019s energy \nmix, strengthening energy security and reducing reliance on fossil fuel. \n \n10.  The project also contributes to accelerating and expanding private investment in clean \nenergy infrastructure in Thailand. It is expected that successful project implementation and \nviable returns will attract other private investors to wind energy projects. \n \n2.  Outcome \n11.  The outcome will be the demonstrated viability and sustainability of a utility-scale wind \nproject in the private sector.. \n \n3.  Outputs \n12.  The output will be the installation and operation of the 7.5 MW wind power plant. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n13.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 supports development that is environmentally sustainable and \nrecognizes  the  role  of  the  private  sector  to  meet  growing  energy  demand  in  the  region, \ncapitalizing on ADB\u2019s operating strengths in infrastructure development, finance, and other \nareas.13 The  strategy  supports  expanding  environment-friendly  technologies  for  clean  and \nefficient energy generation and use, as well as a larger role for the private sector financing of \ninfrastructure through public\u2013private partnership. The project is consistent with the above.  \n \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n14.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2007\u20132011 for Thailand has three core strategic \nareas:  infrastructure,  environmental  sustainability,  and  capital  markets. 14  The  project  is \nconsistent with this strategy. The government\u2019s Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2012\u2013\n2021 notes the immense potential of wind power in Thailand and that energy imports can be \navoided through its use with private investment. The project supports the government\u2019s long-\n                                                \n12 The government has established clean energy targets of 1,200 MW of wind power by 2021 and 25% of primary \ncommercial energy from renewable sources by 2021. \n13 ADB. 2008.

Consistency with the Energy Policy \n15.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which emphasizes investments in \nenergy efficiency, renewable energy projects, and wider access to energy.16 It advances ADB\u2019s \ntarget of investing $2 billion per year in clean energy by 2013 to accelerate low-carbon growth \nand reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the target of the Private Sector \nOperations Department to receive 25% of its annual approvals, by numbers, for clean energy \nprojects. Further, it will support ADB\u2019s target of installing 1 gigawatt of wind power by 2015 \nunder its Quantum Leap in Wind initiative.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.19 \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The project is being developed as a public\u2013private partnership under Thailand\u2019s \nvery small power producer program, which uses renewable energy from private \nsector power plants with capacity of up to 10 MW to provide clean electricity to \nthe grid. \nManagement  The project will be developed and managed by Theppana, a special-purpose \ncompany incorporated in Thailand that is 90% owned by EGCO, which is \nThailand\u2019s first independent power producer and now the second largest private \npower producer in the country. It is listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. \nImplementation period  Q4 2012\u2013Q3 2013, for a construction period of 12 months \nConstruction  The project will be constructed under a fixed-price, date-certain, turnkey EPC \narrangements  arrangement covering all design, engineering, supply, construction, testing, and \ncommissioning.  \nSupplier/Contractor  Goldwind International Holdings (Hong Kong) is the supplier of Goldwind \nturbines. Goldwind is listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong \nKong Stock Exchange. It is the third largest wind turbine manufacturer in the \nworld, with an 8.7% market share and an accumulated capacity of over 13 \ngigawatts  from over 11,000 wind turbines installed worldwide. Goldwind has \nthe longest track record in wind turbine manufacturing in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China and is the global leader in direct-drive permanent magnet technology. \nItalthai Engineering Company is a related company of Italian\u2013Thai Development \nPublic Company (ITD), which specializes in utility engineering for power plants \nand high voltage electrical power substation projects.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n17.  The project is category B for environment. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009), an initial environmental examination was carried out. The project site and its \nimmediate vicinity do not support natural vegetation of ecological significance. The site does not \nprovide important habitat to any terrestrial birds, nor is located along the route of migratory \nbirds. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified, and \neffective measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate them are outlined in the environmental \nmanagement plan. Impacts during construction are short term and will be readily mitigated. \nDuring operation, predicted noise and shadow flicker effects will be studied, confirmed, and \nmonitored. Theppana is committed to hiring qualified staff to implement the plan including the \n ", "6   \nconduct of regular O&M in partnership with Goldwind.25 The cost of mitigation measures is \nincluded in project design and overall project cost. The monitoring program will keep track of \nnoise,  shadow flicker frequency,  bird and  bat injury  or  mortality,  complaints  received,  and \nincidents or accidents. Theppana will submit an annual environmental monitoring report to ADB.    \n \n18.  The  project  is  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples. \nTheppana entered into lease agreements for land under the Agricultural Land Reform Office, \nwhere the wind turbines, substation, and green area will be located, and for Nor Sor 3 Gor26 \nland that will be used for the access road. The lease agreement with the Agricultural Land \nReform Office includes consent signed by farmers who will yield portions of the land they \nfarmed.  These  agreements  were  based  on  negotiation  and  the  agreed  compensation \npackage.27 No land acquisition is required for the transmission line, as Theppana will upgrade \nPEA\u2019s existing transmission line. There are no indigenous peoples at the project site. \n \n19.  During  construction,  250  workers  will  be  engaged,  mainly  as  skilled  and  unskilled \nlaborers. Theppana and its contractors will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and \nreport  annually  to  ADB  on  their  compliance  with  national  labor  laws  and  internationally \nrecognized core labor standards.28 Stakeholders, including communities in the vicinity of the \nproject, were informed and consulted about the project. The project is categorized as having no \ngender element, given its limited potential for gender-inclusive design.29 Although the project \nhas no employment target for women, the sponsor adheres to the principle that there will be no \ndiscrimination in recruiting project workers during construction or operation. Sex-disaggregated \nemployment data will be collected from Theppana. The company has committed to establishing \na grievance redress mechanism to receive complaints and facilitate their resolution. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n20.  Theppana  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n21.  The proposed ADB loan is within the medium-term country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments.  \n \nD.  Assurances \n22.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 30  the \nGovernment of Thailand will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \n                                                \n25 O&M services will be undertaken by Theppana with an option to outsource them to Goldwind for the first 5 years \nafter commencing commercial operations. O&M will include regular inspections, minor repairs, parts replacement, \nand measurement and data verification. \n26  Nor Sor 3 Gor is a certificate issued by the relevant land authority certifying the usage of the land by the holder. \n27 The lease price is fair and constitutes replacement cost.
