INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help increase the capacity of \nexecuting and implementing agencies and fiduciary institutions to implement projects funded by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the Pacific developing member countries (DMCs).  \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, along with the fragile and conflict-affected situations and small \nislands developing states approach, acknowledge that Pacific DMCs face a high degree of fragility \nand have a considerable need for institutional strengthening.1 The strategy requires ADB to tailor \nimplementation processes to the Pacific DMC context and strengthen collaboration with other \ndevelopment partners and civil society organizations to make ADB operations fragility- and \nconflict-sensitive. ADB committed to augment resources to accommodate the added preparation \nand supervision costs arising from security and other related needs to ensure countries that \novercome conflict and fragility do not slip back into those conditions.  \n \n3.  The  ADB  Pacific  Approach,  2021\u20132025, covering  12 small Pacific Island  countries, \nidentified vulnerability to shocks, weak service delivery, and slow growth as core challenges, while \nrecognizing that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is the most severe economic \nshock the countries have faced to date and that the fallout is expected to be felt through to 2023 \nor 2024.2  \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Pacific Department included TA for supporting quality infrastructure and effective \nproject implementation in the Pacific in its 2021\u20132023 regional operations business plan.3 The \nproposed  TA  is  directly  related  to  the  Strategy  2030  operations  priority  of  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity and will cover all Pacific DMCs. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Implementing projects in the Pacific is challenging. ADB classifies seven Pacific DMCs as \nfragile and conflict-affected situations and identifies 11 Pacific DMCs as small islands developing \nstates that exhibit various elements of fragility. They are small, geographically isolated, dependent \non development assistance, prone to disasters, and vulnerable to the effects of climate change. \n \n6.  ADB carried out a project implementation action plan under the TA Building Project \nImplementation Capacities in the Pacific, which wound down in June 2021.4 The TA sought to \nimprove performance ratings for ADB-funded projects in Pacific DMCs with projects on track at \n66% against an ADB average of 64% for 2020.5 For Pacific DMCs, the contract award ratio stood \nat 24% against an ADB average of 28% and the disbursement ratio at 20% against an ADB \naverage of 18% in 2020. The implementation risk, calculated as projects rated either at risk or for \nattention, stood at 34% against the ADB-wide ratio of 36% in 2020.6 \n \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila; \nand ADB. 2021. Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations and Small Island Developing States Approach. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2021. Pacific Approach, 2021\u20132025. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2020. Regional Operations Business Plan: Pacific, 2021\u20132023. Manila. \n4  ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance for Building Project Implementation Capacities in the Pacific. Manila. \n5  The PARD on track rating was 65% in 2016 and steadily improved to 78% in 2019. In 2020, a new, more stringent \nproject performance rating methodology was introduced to strengthen indicators related to technical, financial \nmanagement, and safeguards.  \n6  ADB. 2021. Annual Portfolio Performance Report 2020. Manila. \n ", "2 \n7.  While these percentages reflect generally comparable performance for Pacific DMCs \nagainst overall ADB indicators, these results vary, depending on countries and types of projects. \nIn addition, while some indicators show better results for some countries, maintaining them at \nsuch  levels  require  sustained  efforts.  The  major  causes  for  less-than-adequate  project \nperformance results, including those from lessons learned and ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation \nDepartment reports, are (i) insufficient preparation for implementation during project design; (ii) \ninadequate detailed designs of projects prior to project approval; (iii) limited executing and \nimplementing agency capacity, both in the number of staff and skill levels; (iv) complex and time-\nconsuming  land  access  procedures  and  inadequate  preparation  and  implementation  of \nsafeguards  plans;  (v)  insufficient  consultant,  contractor,  and  supplier  industry  capacity;  \n(vi) communication difficulties as a result of remoteness and inadequate communication facilities \nin the region; and (vii) lack of institutionalization of training provided. The capacity constraints are \nvisible in all areas of project management, procurement, social and environmental safeguards, \nand financial management. \n \n8.  Existing TA, such as the TA Enhancing Quality Portfolio Performance in the Pacific and \nthe TA Sustainable Capacity Development for Safeguards in the Pacific \u2013 Phase 1, take a \nstructured  approach  towards  country  and  regional  needs  assessment  studies,  strategic \ninstitutionalization of capacity building, establishment of links between Pacific DMCs and regional \ninstitutions,  and  overall  procurement  audits,  with  specific  terms  of  reference,  procurement \nmethods, and considerable budget earmarked.7 While transaction TA cover project readiness \nactivities  envisaged  at  the  time  of  project  processing,  additional  work  during  project \nimplementation may become necessary because of exigencies such as disasters, project cost \noverruns, and unforeseen events related to safeguards and procurement. In addition, the COVID-\n19 pandemic is expected to have prolonged effects on project implementation. In many of these \ncases, available loan and grant financing for the project is insufficient to cater to additional \ndemands in a timely and efficient manner. \n \n9.  The proposed TA will supplement available resources with a more flexible focus on \nspecific  project  support  to  increase  project  readiness  and  improve  project  implementation \nperformance of target entities.8 The TA resources will allow ADB and Pacific DMCs to intervene \ndirectly and fill specific gaps in key technical surveys, financial management, procurement, \nsafeguards due diligence, and loan and grant covenant areas where other support is not available \nand where such support will make an immediate difference to project readiness or project \nperformance. The proposed TA will build on the achievements and lessons of previous TA \n(footnote 4).  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: improved delivery of project outcomes in the \nPacific DMCs. The TA will have the following outcome: strengthened capacities of target entities \nin Pacific DMCs. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n7  ADB. 2020. Technical Assistance for Enhancing Quality Portfolio Performance in the Pacific. Manila; ADB. 2020. \nTechnical Assistance for Sustainable Capacity Development for Safeguards in the Pacific \u2013 Phase 1. Manila. \n8  Target entities include executing agencies, implementing agencies of ADB-funded projects, and other specific \ngovernment regulatory or fiduciary agencies related to project management, procurement, consultant selection, \nsocial and environmental safeguards, disbursements, and financial management. \n ", "3 \n11.  To  respond flexibly to clients\u2019 needs  under the  business  process  requirements  and \nconstraints in small island developing countries, the TA will help target entities improve project \nmanagement and implement fit-for-purpose procurement modalities to reduce procurement time, \nincrease administrative efficiency, and improve the quality of project outputs, while maintaining \nsound fiduciary oversight.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Capacity building and equipment support given to target entities. The TA \nwill support relevant project-specific capacity building in target entities, for example, those related \nto  International  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers  (FIDIC)  contract  management. \nThese capacity building measures will combine international best practices with project-related \npractical  issues  and  reflect  lessons  learned.  These  efforts  will  be  complemented  by  the \nprocurement of computers and related software that will improve target entities\u2019 capacity to \nperform such functions. Capacity-building sessions will be supported by consultants, resource \npersons, and ADB staff.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Studies, surveys, due diligence, and assessments conducted. The TA will \nhelp  target  entities  carry  out  context-appropriate  studies,  surveys,  due  diligence,  and \nassessments that support improved project readiness or project performance. Efforts will be made \nto introduce innovative procurement and/or contractual modalities and options to manage risks \nassociated with project implementation.  \n \n14.  Output  3:  Country  and/or  regional  portfolio  review  meetings  and  business \nopportunity seminars conducted. The TA will help organize country and/or regional portfolio \nreview meetings and business opportunity seminars by financing participants\u2019 travel-related costs, \nthe cost of venues, and other associated costs (para. 17). Portfolio review meetings will be \ncombined with capacity building initiatives (output 1) to promote cross-learning. This will provide \nopportunities for the staff of target entities, ADB staff, contractors, consultants, suppliers, and \nservice providers to share knowledge on ongoing and future projects and bidding opportunities. \n \n15.  Continued  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  are  assumed  to  slow  initial  TA \nimplementation. The risks in achieving the outcomes include: (i) high staff turnover in target \nentities, (ii) difficulty in finding quality consultants in the Pacific, and (iii) political instability in some \nPacific DMCs. Coordination among the government, target entities, and ADB will be strengthened \nto mitigate such risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($1,000,000 under TASF 7, and $500,000 under TASF-other \n. \nsources) The governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, and other in-kind contributions. Additional financing may be considered across the life of \n \nthe TA, as appropriate. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB\u2019s Pacific Subregional Office in Suva, Fiji will act as the \nfocal point, working closely with the Portfolio, Results, and Quality Control Unit; Pacific Liaison \nand Coordination Office; Papua New Guinea Resident Mission; and all sector divisions of the \nPacific  Department for  greater coordination  and to  avoid  duplication  of  efforts. To mitigate \n ", "4 \ncontinued COVID-19 travel impacts, in-country national and international consultants will be \nengaged and travel bubbles will be utilized, whenever feasible. The TA will finance international \nand local travel; accommodation; per diem of participants, national consultants working for ADB \nprojects, and ADB staff participating as resource persons; and the cost of venue and other \nassociated costs.
