INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific series is one of the flagship publications of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and is identified as an ADB corporate priority technical \nassistance (TA) project for 2012. Each annual Key Indicators volume includes a special chapter \nthat provides in-depth and data-intensive policy analysis of prevailing critical policy issues, and \na  comprehensive  compendium  and  analysis  of  trends  in  economic,  social,  financial,  and \nMillennium Development Goal indicators for 48 ADB regional members. These statistics are \nwidely used by the development community, policy makers, civil society, the private sector, and \nacademia.  \n \n2.  In order for the Key Indicators series to effectively  promote ADB\u2019s reputation as a \ncredible source of knowledge about the region, and serve as an effective instrument for better \ninformed policies and projects, it is essential that rigorous research on the topic selected for the \nspecial chapter be undertaken, along with intensive data validation, analysis and compilation; \nextensive collaboration with statistical partners; and wider and effective dissemination of the \nresulting publication. This TA will ensure that these activities are carried out effectively. The \nTA\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Compared to other regions, the economy of Asia and the Pacific has grown at a record \npace for the period 1992\u20132008 and still continues to grow until 2012. Many of ADB\u2019s developing \nmember countries (DMCs) are expected to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \nHowever,  despite  the  region\u2019s  remarkable  success  in  lifting  many  people  out  of  poverty, \ndevelopment challenges such as rising inequality are pervasive, and new issues continue to \nemerge. As a result, there is continuing demand for sound policy research that is grounded in \ndata-intensive analysis, which has proven to be a key factor in effectively addressing these \nchallenges. \n \n4.  In  2012  the  Key  Indicators  special  chapter  will  tackle  two  growing  concerns\u2014\nenvironmental sustainability and rapid urbanization. Through rigorous econometric methods that \nuse a variety of survey data and aggregate country-level data, as well as in-depth country-level \nstudies, the research examines developments in urban planning, low-carbon transport, green \nindustry,  green  infrastructure  and  the  role  of  technology,  and  other  areas,  and  draws \nappropriate policy recommendations. Other topics that will be investigated are the impact of \nurbanization on the environment, society, and the economy; the drivers of urbanization; urban \nplanning issues; and associated policy implications.  \n \n5.  Data-intensive policy analysis such as has been outlined for this year\u2019s special chapter \non \u2015Green Urbanization\u2016 requires time and resources. Under the current business process, \nthere is limited time in the publication\u2019s annual production schedule to undertake rigorous data \nanalysis and consolidate research results for a comprehensive policy discussion. As a result, it \nis prudent that potential topics for the special chapters of future Key Indicators volumes be \npromptly identified and that the topic for the 2013 issue be determined much earlier than the \nonset of the next production schedule, thereby allowing more in-depth policy research to be \nundertaken. \n \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 May 2012.  \n ", "2  Appendix 1 \n6.  The  Key  Indicators  series  also  contributes  to  the  region\u2019s  goal  of  achieving  better \ndevelopment outcomes by compiling and disseminating timely and reliable indicators to ADB \nregional members. Effective monitoring of policies and identification of emerging concerns also \nrequires data that are updated and consistent across economies. More than 100 government \nagencies in 48 regional ADB members provide the Key Indicators with their official statistics. \nThese  data  are  validated  and  uploaded  to  ADB\u2019s  Statistical  Database  System  (SDBS),2 \nenabling their use for the Key Indicators statistical tables as well as online dissemination, \nwhereby other users can download them for other purposes. The business process for data \nvalidation and compilation, generation of statistical tables, and dissemination of statistics for the \nKey Indicators volumes must be further automated to improve data quality and provide better \nand  more  timely  access  to  the  data  and  indicators  in  the  publication.  Also,  while  many \ndevelopment  organizations  have  begun  providing  the  statistics  and  analytical  reports  they \ncompile through handheld devices, the main dissemination platforms for the Key Indicators \nremains personal computers and the Internet.  \n \n7.  An important result of the data validation and analysis process for Key Indicators shows \nthat many DMCs\u2014especially those with weak statistical systems\u2014have not yet complied with \ninternationally accepted concepts and data standards, including that of timeliness. While ADB \ncontinues to provide TA to DMCs to build the capacity of their national statistical systems and \nthereby improve data quality and coverage, major constraints remain, including (i) a lack of \ngovernment support; (ii) a lack of information about new data initiatives and resources that could \nbe tapped to improve data standards; and (iii) inadequate skills for adapting data standards, \nwhich persist and can hinder the timeliness and data consistency of official statistics.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA aims to improve the coverage and use of ADB\u2019s annual Key Indicators series for \nmore effective evidence-based policy making and analysis. The expected outcome of the TA is \nthe effective dissemination of the 2012 Key Indicators. \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will support the following key activities: (i) publication of the 2012 Key Indicators \nincluding  data-intensive  research  on  \u2015Green  Urbanization\u2016. (ii)  enhancement  of the quality, \ncoverage, consistency and timeliness of official data and indicators; and (iii) improvement of the \nbusiness processes for data validation, analysis, compilation, production, dissemination of the \npublication, and thorough analysis of important policy issues with identification of emerging \ncritical issues for future special chapters of the Key Indicators series;  \n \n10.  Research on the rapid urbanization taking place in Asia and its relationship to other \nemerging local and global challenges will be undertaken. The research will extrapolate ways in \nwhich policies can help effectively manage urbanization, which can lead to more rapid and \neffective poverty reduction and inclusive growth in Asia and the Pacific.  Background research \npapers will be commissioned to explore topics related to urbanization, such as the impact of \n                                                \n2 There are two versions of SDBS: (i) the Intranet version (http://sdbs.asiandevbank.org), which is available only \nwithin ADB and used to disseminate both official government statistics and those that were purchased from other \norganizations; and (ii) the Internet version (http://sdbs.adb.org), which is used only to disseminate data that were \nobtained without user fees. \n ", "  3 \nurbanization on the environment, society, and economy; the drivers of urbanization; urban \nplanning issues; and policy implications. Studies on urban planning, low-carbon transport, green \nindustry, green infrastructure and the role of technology, and other issues will be consolidated \nand  analyzed  further  to  draw  appropriate  policy  recommendations  from  an  economic \nperspective.  \n \n11.  The conduct of Key Indicators workshops and seminars is crucial to the development of \nthe special chapter, and will firm up initial findings based on the background research papers, \nas well as identify and discuss the constraints and general direction of the special chapter. \nDistinguished  experts  will  be  invited  to  the  workshops.  The  outputs  of  the  Key  Indicators \nworkshops will provide credible statistics and useful inputs on the topic of the special chapter. \nResearch,  consultations,  and  discussions  through  participation  of  staff  in  regional  and \ninternational conferences and seminars will also be undertaken to identify emerging concerns \nthat can be potential topics for future Key Indicators publications. In preparation for the 2012 \nKey Indicators publication, a workshop will be held to which prominent researchers and key \ngovernment representatives will be invited.  \n \n12.  Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2012 will also feature the second edition of the \nFramework of Inclusive Growth Indicators (FIGI) supplement,3 which identifies 35 indicators that \ninclude  the  policy  ingredients  of  inclusive  growth\u2014economic  growth  and  employment \nopportunities, social inclusion, social protection, as well as good governance and institutions. \nWith the well-received first edition of FIGI and with the current trend of economic research that \ngoes  beyond  gross  domestic  product  to  measure  growth  and  wellbeing,  continuing  the \ndevelopment and dissemination of FIGI will support ADB\u2019s focus on better policies to achieve \ninclusive growth through evidence-based policy making. \n \n13.   To further support and complement the earlier work done on inclusive growth, methods \nwill be developed to measure inclusive growth, which will take into account growth in income \nand non-income development outcomes such as health and education. Distribution of these \noutcomes across different subpopulations will be incorporated into the methods as well. These \nmethods will then be used to empirically evaluate the extent to which growth in Asia has been \ninclusive,  both  across  different  dimensions  and  subpopulations,  and  thereby  aid  in  the \nidentification of development gaps and the formulation of relevant policies.  \n \n14.  Statistical consultation workshops on key data issues encountered in the preparation of \nthe  Key  Indicators  will  be  held  with  representatives  of  statistical  partners.  Updates  on \ninternational data compilation standards and current trends in data compilation methods will be \npresented in the workshops. These consultations and discussions will be continued through a \ncommunity of practice website that the TA will initiate and support, to allow an exchange of \nideas and compilation methods among statistical partners in the Asia and the Pacific. Seminars, \nworkshops and conferences to improve data compilation methods that are organized by other \ndevelopment organizations can also be supported, if requested. Higher quality official statistics \nthat are produced by statistical partners will contribute to better policy making and development \noutcomes in the long term.  \n \n15.   The  business  processes  pertaining  to  the  production  of  the  Key  Indicators  will  be \nautomated to improve the timeliness of data dissemination and the production schedule of the \npublication. User-friendly interfaces will be incorporated in the automated system to enhance \n                                                \n3 First published in 2011 as ADB. 2011.

Analytical applications such as \nvisualization through graphs, maps and other graphical tools and generation of statistical tables \nwill be undertaken for both handheld devices and personal computers to expand the Key \nIndicators user base.  \n \n16.  Writers\u2019 workshops will also be organized to improve the drafting of the analysis of key \ntrends that are part of the statistical tables. Data attributes\u2014especially the concepts, definitions \nand deviations from standards that pertain to each data series\u2014will be compiled and updated to \nprovide a better gauge of reliability to users. To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency in \napproach across the different parts of the  Key Indicators, high-quality editing services are \nrequired.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented by the Development \nIndicators and Policy Research Division (ERDI) for 19 months, beginning 1 June  2012 until its \ntargeted completion on 31 December 2013.  \n \n19.  ERDI will closely collaborate with regional departments, including resident missions and \nother international organizations that have common interests in gathering data from its statistical \npartners in ADB\u2019s regional members and in organizing the data consultation workshops in \nselected subregional centers. ERDI will continue to work with the Office of Information Systems \nand Technology in completing the automation of business processes for SDBS and the Key \nIndicators, including the development of an application for handheld devices. ERDI will also \ncoordinate with other development organizations that are conducting statistics capacity-building \nactivities to improve the quality and coverage of official statistics in the region to optimize the \nlimited resources available for this purpose. Dissemination activities will be coordinated with the \nDepartment of External Relations. \n \n20.  An estimated 14 person-months of international individual consultant services and 77 \nperson-months of national individual consultant services will be required to assist ERDI staff in \nundertaking all the activities discussed above. The Institute for International Economic Policy \n(IIEP) at the George Washington University, is the most appropriate institution to undertake \nthese services. IIEP is the most prominent institution in the field of multidimensional poverty \nanalysis as it has the IIEP Ultra-Poverty Initiative which exclusively focuses on poverty research \nand inclusive growth. Further, this Initiative is headed by Professor J. Foster, who developed the \npoverty measure which has been used in the poverty estimates which ADB reports as well as \nglobally,  including  by  the  UN,  other  MDBs  and  the  research  community.  Its  widely  cited \nresearch places it as the leading center for scholarship on global poverty, and it has shown a \nkeen interest in working in this region. Thus, IIEP is best suited to be engaged for $100,000 \nthrough single-source selection to develop methods to measure inclusive growth and conduct \nempirical and policy-relevant studies.  The terms of reference for the individual consultants and \nIIEP  are  in  Appendix  3.  IIEP  will  provide  an  estimated  6  person-months  of  international \nconsultant services and 3 person-months of national consultant services. \n \n ", "  5 \n21.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). All the procurement to be financed under the TA will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2012, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact       \nCitations in major  Publicly available citation data   \nImproved coverage and  newspapers and   \nuse of the Key  publications   \nIndicators.     \nNumber of government  Citations as a source in \ndevelopment plans that  government development plans \nuse the Key Indicators \nresearch results and \ndata. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n  www.adb.org downloads  www.adb.org download monthly  Sufficient publicity \n  report  is given to Key \nKey Indicators 2012  Number of articles and    Indicators for Asia \ndisseminated.  interviews in major  DER media coverage report.  and the Pacific \ninternational media    2012 \n     \nNumber of participants  Dissemination events evaluation \n(M/F)  in the  reports \ndissemination activities    \n   \nNumber of tablet  Apple Store and Android \ndownloads.
