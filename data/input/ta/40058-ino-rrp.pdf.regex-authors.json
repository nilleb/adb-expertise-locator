It supports the broad goal of the RPJM to \nstimulate  higher  and  sustainable  economic  growth  (to  7%  average \nannual  growth  by  2009  from  around  4%  prior  to  2004)  and  halve \npoverty (from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2% by 2009). To achieve these goals, \nDPSP-2 supports wide-ranging reforms in four core areas to (i) improve \nmacroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, (ii) promote investments, \n(iii)  strengthen  the  public  financial  management  and  anticorruption \nframework, and (iv) improve the delivery of public services. DPSP-2 is \nproposed as a single tranche operation based on a range of up-front \nactions taken by the Government in the core areas. \n   \nRationale  The  DPL  series  aims  to  harmonize  policy  reform  support  from  key \ndevelopment  partners.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  DPL  process \neffectively builds on and deepens sector-specific reforms supported by \nADB through its past operations, as well as planned operations under \nthe new country strategy and program 2006-2009. \n \nADB\u2019s participation in the DPL stems from its endeavors to reduce \ntransaction costs for its developing member countries. The approach is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s reform agenda, as outlined in the Long-Term \nStrategic  Framework  2001-2015,  and  the  Middle-Income  Country \nInitiative.  Participation  in  DPL  helps  implement  and  fulfill  ADB\u2019s \nobligations  to  the  Rome  Declaration  on  harmonizing  procedures  of \nmultilateral and bilateral development institutions (February 2003) and \nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (March 2005).  \n   \nImpact and  The impact of DPSP-2 will be in the form of higher economic growth ", "ii   \nOutcome  that is sustained over the medium-term and lower levels of poverty and \nunemployment.  Its  principal  outcomes  include:  (i)  improved \nmacroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  better  investment  climate,  (iii)  good \ngovernance in public administration, and (iv) improved delivery of public \nservices.  \n   \nCluster   For DPSP-2, the Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of \nFinancing Plan  $200 million. The Government envisages support from ADB of around \n$200 million for DPSP-3, which will be reconfirmed during DPSP review \nand processing. DPSP-2 provides parallel cofinancing for the World \nBank\u2019s DPL-3, for which the Government has requested $600 million \nfrom  the  World  Bank.  The  Government  has  also  requested  the \nGovernment of Japan to cofinance the DPSP-2/DPL-3. \n   \nLoan Amount and  A single tranche program loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \nTerms  capital  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment \ncharge of 0.75% per annum; conversion options that may be exercised \nin accordance with the draft loan agreement, the loan regulations, and \nADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft program loan agreement. \n   \nDisbursement  The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of loan \neffectiveness. \n   \nProgram Period and  The DPSP-2 covers progress made in general macroeconomic and key \nTranching  high-level sector reforms during 2006. All actions included in the policy \nmatrix have been implemented within the year. The DPSP-2 fits within \nthe  overall  reform  agenda  supported  under  the  DPLs,  which  cover \n2003\u20132007. DPSP-3 will be implemented from January to December \n2007, and will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of loan \neffectiveness. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs (CMEA) \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans, the loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed to the Republic of Indonesia as the Borrower. No supporting \nimport documentation will be required, if, during each year when loan \nproceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Indonesia\u2019s total \nimports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, \nand imports financed under other official development assistance, is \nequal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be \ndisbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import \n ", "  iii\ndocumentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n   \nProgram Benefits  The key benefits expected from the DPSP cluster are as follows: \nand Beneficiaries   \n(i)  Progress  toward  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  objectives  of \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness,  improved \ninvestment climate, reduced corruption, and improved governance. \n(ii)  Consolidation of recent macroeconomic and policy reforms leading \nto the formulation of a credible medium-term public expenditure \nframework,  backed  by  measures  to  curtail  wasteful  public \nspending. \n(iii)  Institutional  development  within  government  institutions,  Bank \nIndonesia, and banks. \n(iv)  Greater public confidence in the banking system stemming from \nthe introduction of the deposit protection scheme. \n(v)  Sustained  ADB  engagement  in  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment on the direction and content of, and strategies for, its \neconomic,  structural,  and  institutional  reform  agenda\u2014with  the \nDPSP  series  providing  for  policy  continuity  and  consistency  in \nsectors where ADB has been actively involved. \n(vi)  Facilitation  of  sector-specific  reforms  in  areas  where  ADB  is \nproviding or planning support.   \n(vii)  Harmonization  and  parallel  financing  by  the  key  development \npartners (ADB, World Bank, and Government of Japan) around a \ncommon  policy  framework  and  dialogue,  and  the  resulting \nendorsement  of  the  Government\u2019s  sound  policy  implementation \nand macroeconomic management. \n   \nRisks and  The implementation of the DPSP series is subject to the following risks: \nSafeguards   \n(i)  Policy and coordination risks. Economic volatility could worsen if \nthe Government does not sustain the reform momentum to follow \nup on the recent reduction in fuel subsidies (including maintaining \nappropriate interest rates and investment climate reforms). External \nvulnerabilities  must  also  be  considered.  However,  following  the \ncurrency market volatility in August 2005, the need for rapid policy \nadjustment  on  the  domestic  front  in  line  with  key  global \ndevelopments is clearly recognized. The Government and Bank \nIndonesia have considerably enhanced their coordination, which \nwill be reinforced by measures under DPSP-2. \n \n(ii)  Fiduciary  constraints.  Despite  the  improvements  under  way, \nthere  are  continuing  concerns  over  the  utilization  of  public \nresources.  The  overall  fiduciary  assessments  undertaken  since \n2001 (with the Country Financial Accountability Assessment) have \nindicated  considerable  improvements  in  the  overall  fiduciary \nenvironment in Indonesia. Ongoing programs supported by several \ndevelopment partners provide significant TA support to strengthen \nfiduciary governance. The focus on the Treasury Single Account \nimplementation will significantly enhance transparency. The DPSP \n   ", "iv   \ncluster  will  help  enhance  overall  accountability  as  well,  as \ndemonstrated  for  instance  by  submission  of  government-wide \nfinancial  statements  to  parliament  and  their  widespread \ndissemination. \n \n(iii)  Coordination and capacity constraints. Effective implementation \nof reforms has been hindered in the past by lack of coordination \nbetween ministries and government agencies, and lack of capacity. \nLack  of  such  coordination  could  slow  down  reforms.  Changing \nincentives  and  improving  performance  orientation  in  the  civil \nservice\u2014an area supported under the DPSP cluster\u2014will be key to \nalleviating  these  constraints.  Some  ministries  (e.g., Ministry  of \nFinance) have begun to promote civil servants on the basis of merit \nrather than age or seniority. To address capacity constraints, the \nGovernment has begun to use technical assistance (TA) resources \nmore  effectively  for  implementation  purposes  and  on-the-job \ntraining. \n \n(iv)  Public  opposition  to  reforms.  The  public  and  special interest \ngroups  generally  oppose  tariff  reforms  and  some  aspects  of \ninvestment  climate  reforms  (such  as  labor).  The  Government \nmanaged the fuel subsidy reduction well, while labor reforms have \nslowed down. The DPSP cluster allows for flexibility, enabling the \nGovernment to build consensus for reforms to ensure that they are \naccepted.       \n \n(v)  Heightened security risks. Alerts stemming from sectarian and \nregional conflicts and terrorism could slow foreign direct investment \nand set back the recovering tourism industry. The Government and \nlaw enforcement authorities have taken a range of measures aimed \nat rebuilding public and investor confidence. \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a (i) proposed \nprogram cluster of two loans for the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP) in the \nRepublic of Indonesia, and (ii) a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the second \nDevelopment  Policy  Support  Program  (DPSP-2),  which  is  subprogram  1  of  the  proposed \ncluster. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR AND MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  Sector Performance, Issues, and Opportunities  \n2.  In the past few years, Indonesia has provided compelling reasons for a positive outlook, \nas it has become more stable, democratic, and increasingly transparent. The concern is no \nlonger one of recovery, but of accelerating and sustaining real gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth  at  7\u20138%  levels,  and  translating  that  into  lower  poverty,  more  jobs,  and  reduced \nvulnerability. The Government\u2019s overall goals are to halve poverty by the end of the decade to \nabout  8%,  reduce  unemployment  significantly  from  the  current  high  levels  of  10.4%,  and \nachieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  targets.  To  achieve  these  goals,  the \nGovernment is poised to pursue a pro-growth agenda, coupled with better governance within \nthe public administration and improvements in public service delivery. Progress has been made \non all fronts, albeit slowly in some areas. In particular, Indonesia is in critical need of, among \nother  things,  continuous  improvements  in  the  investment  climate  and  greater  performance \norientation within the civil service. The DPSP cluster allows the Government to work with the \ndevelopment partners in a flexible manner to implement high level macroeconomic and strategic \nreforms, addressing constraints that impede growth and poverty reduction through committed \nannual engagement that provides predictability of support. As such, its sector coverage is fairly \nbroad and it adopts a thematic approach to improve overall economic governance. The CSP \nprovides for deeper sector level interventions sequenced at regular intervals to complement \nmacroeconomic reform support through the DPSP cluster.  \n \n3.  Sustained Macroeconomic Performance. The economy of Indonesia ended 2005 with \noverall real GDP growth of 5.6%, the best performance to date since the Asian financial crisis. \nTable 1 presents data on key indicators over 2001\u20132005 that show the continuous recovery and \nrestoration of macroeconomic stability. The economy has grown at a steady and sustained pace \nand investor confidence has risen, supported by the bold decision in October 2005 to increase \nfuel oil prices by 126%. The efforts and commitment to implement structural reforms, and \neffective coordination between the Government and Bank Indonesia (BI), have significantly \nimproved market confidence, taking the rupiah to its strongest level in 2 years and the stock \nmarket to record high levels. The rupiah appreciated by about 8% over January\u2013September \n2006 to Rp9,100 per $, and the Jakarta Stock Index posted a 24% gain to 1,460 over the same \nperiod. Citing an improved policy environment, Moody\u2019s raised Indonesian bond ratings (foreign \nand domestic) from B2 to B1, followed by an upgrade by Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) from B+ to \nBB- in July. However, Moody\u2019s rating is still four levels from investment grade and the S&P \nrating three levels below investment grade. \n \n4.  The reduction in fuel subsidies created a large fiscal space of about $5 billion in 2005 \nand an estimated $10 billion in 2006, which in turn has enabled a scaling up of spending on \nhealth, education, and rural infrastructure. Nonetheless, inflation accelerated during October\u2013\nNovember 2005 to over 18% and stayed at around that level until June 2006 as fuel price \nincreases percolated down, and interest rates rose from 8.0% to 12.75% from October 2005 to \nJune 2006. Both have started declining in recent months, with prudent monetary management \nbringing interest rates down to 10.25%, and year-on-year inflation to 14.6% as at the end of ", "2   \nOctober 2006. Scaling up of spending combined with a close watch on inflation has helped \naccelerate real GDP growth from 4.7% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2006 to 5.2% in the \nsecond quarter. Overall, it is estimated that the economy will grow by about 5.6% in 2006, with \nboth upside and downside risks. Much depends on the outcomes of the Government\u2019s efforts to \naccelerate spending. If they are implemented well, the recently adopted policy reform packages \n(see Government\u2019s development strategy below) could have a major stimulating impact on the \neconomy. \n \nTable 1: Indonesia - Key Macroeconomic Indicators \nIndicator  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \nReal GDP growth (%)  3.8  4.3  5  4.9  5.6 \nInflation (%; average of period)  11.5  11.9  9.8  3.1  10.5 \nM2 growth (% annual growth)  13  4.7  8.1  8.1  16.4 \nExternal debt as % of GDP  81.1  64.4  56.8  53.9  47.4 \nDebt service ratio (as % of exports of goods and services)  36  32.1  29.8  31.2  38.6 \nOverall fiscal balance as % of GDP  (2.4)  (2.1)  (1.7)  (1.1)  (0.5) \nCurrent account balance as % of GDP  4.2  3.8  3.4  1.2  1.1 \nGross official reserves ($ million)  28  32  36.3  36.3  34.7 \n     in months of imports  5.7  6.3  6.8  5.9  4.9 \n() = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, M2 = broad money.   \nSource: Ministry of Finance; Central Bureau of Statistics. \n              \n \n5.  Continued  Prudence  in  Fiscal  Management.  The  Government  has  continued  its \nstance on fiscal consolidation, although there are concerns over the overall effectiveness of \npublic  expenditure  orientation,  particularly  with  regard  to  development  spending  and  its \nmanagement. The central government budget deficit stood at 0.5% of GDP at the end of 2005, \nand the public debt-to-GDP ratio improved to 47% (down from 55% in 2004 and 100% in 1999). \nIndonesia\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is now quite close to the level in Malaysia (45.7%); Thailand \n(26.1%) is considerably lower, but the Philippines (72.3%) is much higher. While the declining \ndeficit in 2005 builds on the recent track record of low deficits and a rapidly improving debt-to-\nGDP ratio, it also reflects low spending in early 2005, especially on capital projects.   \n \n6.  With the fiscal space generated by the fuel subsidy reduction, the Government should be \nable to scale up public investment from the current level of 5% of GDP to about 7% by 2008\u2014a \nlevel matching the pre-crisis period. The Government and parliament have agreed to increase \nthe budget deficit target for 2006 from 0.7% in the approved budget to 1.1% to help meet: \n(i) expenditures  related  to  the  Yogyakarta  earthquake,  (ii)  additional  expenditures  on  cash \ntransfers to the poor to cushion the impact of the fuel price increases, and (iii) the higher \nelectricity subsidy payments to the State Electricity Corporation (PLN), necessitated by last \nyear\u2019s doubling of fuel prices (para.29 below). The revised 2006 and new 2007 budgets project \ncontinued higher revenues and expenditures. The 2007 budget predicts a deficit of 1.1% of \nGDP with rising non-oil and gas taxes (from 13.6% to 14.4% of GDP) and continued spending at \n21.6% of GDP, as the impact of high oil prices continues to be felt. For example, capital \nspending remains at just over 2% of GDP in 2007 (from 1.2% in 2005).  \n \n7.  In 2006 and 2007, transfers to the regions also remain high at over 7% of GDP, up from \n5.6% of GDP in 2005. These expenditure increases are the effect of higher oil prices and allow \nthe Government to finance new spending initiatives for the poor in 2006 and 2007\u2014such as the \ncurrent unconditional cash transfer (UCT), the scale up of the community designed development \n ", "  3\n(CDD) program, and the pilot of a conditional cash transfer (CCT) system. In recent months, a \nnumber of local governments have built up temporary reserves in the banking system in 2005\u2013\n2006, estimated at about Rp70 trillion (over $7 billion). Although both spending needs and \nregional  disparities  in  terms  of  outcomes  are  significant  in  the  health,  education,  and \ninfrastructure sectors, local governments need to accelerate the execution of development \nprojects. The CDD program is expected to be accelerated significantly in 2007. \n \n8.  Given Indonesia\u2019s dependence on oil and gas exports, increased expenditure is not \nexpected to impact fiscal sustainability negatively as long as international oil prices remain \nrelatively high. Nonetheless, the gross financing needs are estimated to remain high over the \nmedium  term,  reflecting  higher  debt  repayment  needs  in  2006\u20132009  and  the  anticipated \nincrease  in  public  investments.  Domestic  debt  amortization  has  also  increased  as  the \nGovernment plans to implement debt buyback to smoothen the debt maturity profile. At the \nsame time, the foreign debt repayment burden is likely to be less because the Rupiah exchange \nrate has appreciated. The Government\u2019s strategy is to meet these additional financing needs (i) \nby  issuing  additional  government  bonds  ($3.8  billion);  (ii)  through  additional  privatization \n($0.2 billion); and (iii) through program loans ($1.3 billion), for which the Government has sought \nsupport  from  ADB  ($600  million in  disbursements),  World  Bank  ($600  million),  and  Japan \n($100 million).  \n \n9.  Translating  Growth  into  Welfare\u2014Poverty  Profile  and  Prospects  for  the \nAttainment of the Millennium Development Goals. Indonesia has a good track record in \npoverty reduction and social development. The proportion of people living below the national \npoverty line has declined consistently from about 40% in the mid-1970s to just above 17% in \n1996. It had a sharp spike during the economic crisis\u2014increasing to 23.4% in 1999\u2014before \ndeclining to the pre-crisis level of below 17% in 2004, and further to just under 16% in 2005. \nHowever, the inflationary impact of the fuel subsidy reductions partly affected the decline, as \nevident  from  the  March  2006  household  expenditure  survey  which  reflected  that  poverty \nincidence rose to 17.75%. The magnitude of poverty is still high at 39.5 million people, while \nmany more are vulnerable to poverty. The population living below $1/day is 8.5%, while the \nproportion  of  the  population  living  below  $2/day  is  49.6%,  or  about  10%  higher  than  the \ncomparable average for East Asia (including the People\u2019s Republic of China). There is a very \nlarge group of near-poor in Indonesia who are highly vulnerable to shocks at all levels. \n \n10.  Indonesia has managed to achieve some progress on MDGs. Health and schooling \nindicators have improved over time, as well as in comparison with other regional economies. In \ngeneral, the country is on track to meet most MDG targets.1 However, the country has to catch \nup with other similarly developed countries. For example, while Indonesia is likely to reach the \ngoal of universal primary completion rate by 2015, nine countries in East Asia and Pacific have \nalready achieved that goal, including People\u2019s Republic of China, Mongolia, Philippines, and \nViet Nam.2 The only area where the country is currently severely off track is in forestry, where \ntargets on reversing forestry loss will likely not be achieved. While child mortality has declined in \nIndonesia, progress has been slow in general in health. Indonesia currently remains off track in \nachieving targets in measles immunization for infants under age one, maternal mortality, and \nimproving access to improved drinking water. Child malnutrition has seen an overall decrease \nfrom 37.5% since 1989 to 27.3% in 2002, though progress from year to year has fluctuated. \nOver the same period, severe malnutrition has increased from 6.3% in 1989 to 8.0% in 2002. \nThe statistics support the conclusion that Indonesia still has some way to go before reaching the \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006.

Translating  Growth  into  Equity  and  Efficiency\u2014Progress  on  the  Governance \nFront. Indonesia has made significant progress in improving governance since the crisis, but \nparticularly over the last 2 years. Legal reforms on elections and decentralization have resulted \nin greater transparency and political accountability. There is open public debate on a wide range \nof issues, including the Government\u2019s performance, quality of public administration, corruption, \nand provision of government support to the private sector. The Government\u2019s openness and \ncommitment to fighting corruption has been noteworthy. It has established and strengthened a \nrange of independent oversight and judicial institutions such as the Corruption Eradication \nCommission,  Anti-Corruption  Court,  Judicial  Commission,  Police  Commission,  and \nProsecutorial Commission. The capacity and role of other independent institutions such as the \nSupreme Audit Institution (BPK), Financial Transactions Analysis and Tracking Center, and \nAttorney General\u2019s Office\u2014all of which receive or have received significant ADB support\u2014have \nalso  been  strengthened.  The  Government  has  launched  various  high  profile  corruption \ninvestigations, leading to several successful prosecutions. \n \n12.  Nevertheless, the approach taken to date has been more reactive than proactive. The \ninitial zeal in the prosecution of high profile cases has not yet translated into a systematic \napproach for combating corruption. While the President has taken anticorruption seriously, there \nhas been no effective bridge to reduce the significant disconnect between the new vision and \nthe old way of doing business in most of the line ministries and other public sector agencies. An \nanticorruption package was adopted through Presidential Instruction No. 5/2005 in February \n2005, soon after the new Government took power. With over 100 action plans, the package was \n ", "  5\nmeant to institutionalize preventive measures against corruption. While annual updates were \nenvisaged, enforcement and coordination have turned out to be complex. The Government has \nrecently begun to take some significant first steps to develop and pilot models for civil service \nreform targeting high level public officials and specific ministries (Ministry of Finance [MOF], \nMinistry of Trade, and Ministry of National Education), though a more comprehensive reform of \nthe bureaucracy has not yet been developed. There have been recent encouraging signs that \nbroader measures are under consideration with the proposed establishment of a team reporting \ndirectly to the President. However, reform of the judicial system has stalled and there has been \nsome backtracking as a result of Supreme Court and Constitutional Court decisions to curb \nchecks and balances on judicial power through newly created institutions such as the Judicial \nCommission and the Anti-Corruption Court.  \n \n13.  At decentralized local government levels, the direct election of district heads has brought \nresources and delivery of public services closer to people. In 2006\u20132007, a large number of the \nover 440 districts will hold local elections. Given strong anti-incumbent sentiment in the majority \nof locations, stronger demand for good governance is emerging across the country. Surveys \nshow that there has been no tangible improvement in service delivery, although it has not \ndeteriorated since decentralization. In particular, significant disparities have emerged across the \nregions in key social indicators, and vulnerability to poverty remains a key risk. With central-to-\nlocal government transfers increasing every year\u2014supported by the October 2005 decision to \nreduce fuel subsidies\u2014it is critical that the regions become more accountable in delivering \nadequate and quality public services. \n \n14.  Other Recent Developments. Indonesia remains vulnerable to natural calamities. Just \nas  the  reconstruction  process  was  beginning  to  gear  up  in  Aceh  and  Nias,  Yogyakarta, \nCentral Java and West Java faced another round of devastating earthquakes and a tsunami. \nThe loss of over 6,000 lives in Yogyakarta and Central Java in late May 2006 and another \n600 lives in West Java in late July has challenged the Government and development partners. \nYet,  the  response  has  been  swift  and  commendable.  The  other  major  challenge  facing \nIndonesia is the spread of avian flu and the continuing risks of bird-to-human transmission, with \n44 human deaths as of mid-September 2006. Recently, after significant delays, there is an \nagreement within the Government on a detailed action plan. A program of $250 million per year, \njointly funded by the Government and the international community, is being put in place. A multi-\ndonor Java Reconstruction Fund is in the final stages of establishment to channel contributions \nfrom various donor countries for the rehabilitation and reconstruction process. \n \nB.  Program Structure and the Government\u2019s Strategy \n15.  The DPSP, structured as a program cluster, supports a common development policy \nagenda under the Development Policy Loan (DPL) series prepared by a joint team of the \nGovernment of Indonesia (the Government), World Bank, Government of Japan, and Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).3 Building on the support through the DPSP (approved in December \n2005), the proposed DPSP-2 will provide parallel cofinancing support to the Government to help \nimplement reforms under the third Development Policy Loan (DPL-3)\u2014the third in a program of \nfour annual, single tranche loans to support high level macroeconomic and crosscutting sector \nreforms to accelerate economic growth. The DPL series aims to help the Government achieve \nits  medium-term  growth  and  poverty  reduction  objectives  through  four  core  policy  areas: \n                                                 \n3  As ADB did not participate in DPL-1, a different title\u2014the DPSP\u2014has been adopted for ADB\u2019s operations. The \nequivalence is as follows: DPL-1 = ADB\u2019s participation through policy dialogue; DPL-2 = DPSP-1; DPL-3 =     \nDPSP-2; and DPL-4 = DPSP-3. The proposed program cluster is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \n2006\u20142009 for Indonesia, which supports continued co-financing of the DPLs.  \n   ", "6   \n(i) macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, (ii) improved investment climate, (iii) enhanced \npublic financial management, and (iv) improved service delivery to the poor.  \n \n16.  The DPL process has the following phases:  \n(i)  DPL-1, financed by the World Bank ($300 million in December 2004) and the \nGovernment  of  Japan  ($100  million  in  March  2005),  supported  the \nimplementation of reform measures outlined in the Government\u2019s white paper, \nadopted in late 2003, to bridge the credibility gap likely to arise immediately \nfollowing  Indonesia\u2019s  exit  on  1  January  2004  from  the  post-crisis  program \nsupported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF); DPL-1 also supported the \nimplementation of President Yudhoyono\u2019s 100-Day Plan.4  \n(ii)  DPL-2,  a  product  of  joint  missions  and  financing  of  ADB  ($200  million  in \nDecember 2005), Government of Japan ($100 million in March 2006), and World \nBank  ($400  million  in  December  2005),  was  activated  upon  satisfactory \ncompliance with the triggers agreed on during 2004. \n(iii)  DPL-3, the present phase, covering reforms implemented during 2006, and  \n(iv)  DPL-4, which is included in the World Bank\u2019s country assistance strategy and \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program 2006\u201420095 (CSP) as DPSP-3, with the \naim of ensuring continuity of reform measures currently under way. \n \n17.  The  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJM).  The  Government  aims  to  achieve \npeace and security, justice and democracy, and prosperity for all. Within the 2004\u201309 time \nframe of the RPJM is an ambitious goal of cutting the poverty rate by half, to 8.2%. The \nGovernment\u2019s annual work plan (RKP), approved each year by the cabinet, guides RPJM \nimplementation. The RKPs set out annual development priorities, including quantitative targets \nand policy directions, which in turn determine budgetary allocations. The RKP for 2006 has \nseven  priority  areas:  to  reduce  poverty  and  disparity,  increase  employment,  revitalize \nagriculture, improve access to and quality of education, reduce corruption, strengthen defense \ncapacities, and rehabilitate and reconstruct Aceh and Nias. The linkage between the RKP \npriorities and the four core policy areas of DPSP-2 is in Figure 1. \n \n18.  The priorities of the RKP are linked to the state budget and include quantitative targets \nand policy direction. As an annual implementation document, the RKP has a pro-poor focus \nrelative to the RPJM, reinforcing several of the priorities in the draft national poverty reduction \nstrategy. The RKP is the first time that policy priorities, albeit broadly defined, have been so \nclearly identified in a pro-poor manner, and a conscious attempt is made to use the priorities to \nallocate resources among ministries. The 2006 budget builds on the revised budget for 2005 \nwhich placed a priority on poverty reduction objectives, demonstrated by the reallocation of \nexpenditures from the highly regressive fuel subsidy to health, education, rural infrastructure, \nand food support programs that were expected to benefit the poor. This thrust is expected to \ncontinue  in  the  2007  budget.  For  instance,  the  Government  has  scaled  up  education \ninvestments by 18.5% to Rp51.3 trillion ($5.6 billion). \n \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB  was  closely  involved  in  implementing  the  White  Paper  and  the  100-Day  Plan,  through:  (i)  programs \nimplemented during 2003\u20132004, including the Financial Governance and Social Security Reform Program, State-\nOwned Governance and Privatization Program, and Industrial Competitiveness and Small and Medium Enterprise \nDevelopment Program; and (ii) policy dialogue to strengthen national and local government public financial \nmanagement,  leading  to  the  State  Audit  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  (SDP),  approved  in \nDecember 2004, and the Local Government Finance and Governance Reform SDP, approved in November 2005.  \n5  ADB. 2006.

To help implement the RKP priorities, the Government adopted three comprehensive \npolicy packages in the first half of 2006, all with a time-bound implementation plan and clearly \ndefined ministerial responsibilities. The Infrastructure Policy Package6 set out a comprehensive \nreform agenda covering a range of crosscutting issues relating to private sector participation, \nrisk management, public service obligations, and the role of different levels of government in \ninfrastructure provision; and sector planning, legal and regulatory arrangements, tariff policies, \nand infrastructure access. With its scope covering nine infrastructure sectors, the package aims \nto revive and accelerate infrastructure investments\u2014particularly through greater public-private \npartnerships. The Investment Climate Policy Package7 supports broad-ranging reforms on tax, \ncustoms, investment law, and labor. A Financial Sector Reform Package aims to strengthen \nbanking and nonbanking sectors, and diversify sources of financial intermediation. Through \nthese packages, the Government has demonstrated a clear willingness to deal with a number of \n                                                 \n6  Adopted through a Decree of the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs (CMEA) on behalf of the National \nCommittee for the Acceleration of Infrastructure Provision on 17 February 2006. \n7  Adopted through Presidential Instruction No. 3/2006 on 27 February 2006. \n   ", "8   \ncomplex, and in some cases politically sensitive, issues that have been on hold for some time. \nFinally, a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) reform package is under preparation. \n \n20.  The  RPJM-DPSPs\u2014the  Government  and  Development  Partner  Coordination. \nSupport for the RPJM through parallel cofinancing of the DPL series is a key pillar of ADB\u2019s \nCSP for 2006\u20132010. Under the CSP, a dual-track approach is adopted to ensure that high level \nmacroeconomic and governance reforms supported under the DPL are reinforced at the sector \nlevel. Figure 2 presents the approach, which involves structuring of ADB\u2019s support through \n(i) participation in the DPLs to strengthen the macroeconomic and fiscal framework and address \ncrosscutting concerns; and (ii) sector-specific policy interventions in the areas of infrastructure, \nfinancial deepening, local government finance and public financial management, and poverty \nreduction and accelerating progress towards the MDGs. ADB\u2019s dual-track approach aims to \nalign  and  harmonize  development  partner  strategies  with  Indonesia\u2019s  country  strategy  and \npriorities. ADB\u2019s participation in the DPL process and the parallel policy dialogue on sector \nreforms has been appreciated by the Government.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n21.  The impact of DPSP-2 will be in the form of higher economic growth that is sustained \nover the medium term, and lower levels of poverty and unemployment. Its principal outcomes \ninclude:  (i)  improved  macroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  better  investment  climate,  (iii)  good \ngovernance in public administration, and (iv) improved delivery of public services.  \n \n22.  The design and monitoring framework of the DPSP cluster is in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 \npresents the background to the DPSP-2 triggers, along with a summary assessment of the \noutcomes of actions supported under DPSP-1. The development policy letter, the policy matrix \nfor DPSP-2, and triggers for the forward-looking program are in Appendix 3. The summary \nmacroeconomic  assessment  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  which  has  been \nprepared to underpin program lending operations by ADB and the World Bank, is in Appendix 4. \nAppendix 5 presents the development partner coordination matrix, outlining support from ADB \nand other development partners in areas related to the DPSP cluster. \n \nB.  Important Features \n \n23.  The  DPSP  cluster  has  several  innovative  features.  First,  it  is  fully  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda. This promotes full ownership and participation, as demonstrated \nby the Government\u2019s willingness to offer fairly complex reform areas such as tax administration, \nanticorruption, and civil service reform for inclusion in the DPSP agenda. Second, designed as a \nprogram cluster, it provides for continuity of engagement by the development partners in a \nseamless manner over the medium term. As it does not have the rigidity built into the traditional \nconditionality-driven  multiple  tranche  programs,  the  program  structure  promotes  greater \nparticipation of civil servants at all levels. Third, it aims to reduce transaction costs to the \nGovernment as well as the development partners, through greater harmonization among the \nlatter. The close coordination has significantly helped in increasing the efficiency and benefits of \nsupport from the respective institutions, particularly with regard to technical assistance (TA). \nFourth, governance is a recurring theme throughout the DPSP cluster, as it aims to promote \ntransparency in all its core policy areas. Thus, good governance is both an input as well as an \noutcome in the DPSP cluster. \n ", "  9\nFigure 2: Support for the Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan \nStrategic Framework: Medium Term Development Plan (RPJM)\n \nOutcomes:  \n(i)  Revive economic growth to achieve 7% average annual real GDP growth by 2009  \n(ii)  Halve poverty from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2% by 2009 \n(iii)  Reduce unemployment by 2009 from the current levels above 10% \n(iv)  Promote good governance through combating corruption \n(v)  Ensure peace, safety, security, justice, and democracy for all Indonesians \nClose seamless \nDPL Series (Coordinated by  coordination  Sector Programs under the New \nthe World Bank)  moving from  CSP (Coordinated by ADB) \n (cid:190)  High level macroeconomic  macroeconomic   (cid:190)  Deeper sector-specific \nand cross-sector reforms  to sector  implementation support for policy, \n(cid:190)  2\u20133 strategic triggers per   reforms,  institutional, regulatory reforms  \ncore policy area (CPA)  reinforced by  (cid:190)  Each program designed as a \n(cid:190)  Annual program lending  cofinancing  cluster, with subprograms \nsupport  where possible  sequenced over 18\u201324 months  \nCPA  1:  Macroeconomic  Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program \nStability and Creditworthiness  (IRSDP) Cluster \n\u2022  Effective fiscal policy  \u2022  Comprehensive sector and cross-sector reforms as \n\u2022  Macro-level support for  outlined in the IRSDP Program Cluster over 2005\u201310 \ndecentralization  \u2022  Establishment of project development facility \n\u2022  Fiscal-monetary  \u2022  Supporting infrastructure project transactions \ncoordination \n\u2022  Debt management \nFinancial Governance and Social Security Reform \nProgram Cluster \n\u2022  Strengthening oversight and institutional governance \nCPA 2: Improving Investment \n\u2022  Promoting regulatory harmonization \nClimate \n\u2022  Product diversification, long-term financing modalities, \n\u2022  Legal framework \nand deepening of bond markets \n\u2022  Financial stability \n\u2022  Macro-level support \n(e.g., fiscal incentives,  Local Government Finance and Governance Reform \nrisk sharing)  (LGFGR) Program Cluster and the State Audit Reform \n(STAR) Program \n\u2022  Ex-ante planning and budget reforms through LGFGR \nCPA 3: Improving Public \n\u2022  Streamlining fiscal decentralization \nFinancial Management \n\u2022  Local government level civil service reforms \n\u2022  Transparency and good \n\u2022  Improving public financial management (ex-ante aspects \ngovernance \nthrough LGFGR and internal control and audits through \n\u2022  Institutional measures (e.g., \nSTAR Program) \nTreasury Single Account) \nCPA 4: Improving Public  Poverty Reduction and MDG Acceleration Program \nService Delivery  Cluster \n\u2022  Establishing and  \u2022  Improving delivery of health, education, and other \ninstitutionalizing national- community services in MDG-deficit areas, in a \nlevel program evaluation  programmatic manner \n\u2022  Targeted cross-sector  \u2022  Enhancing accountability for service delivery at local \nreform  government and institutional levels, reinforced by well-\ndefined standards that are based on clear costing  \n\u2022  Facilitating transition toward greater performance \nSource: ADB staff. \norientation \n   \n ", "10  \nC.  Policy Framework and Actions8 \n \n24.  The DPSP-1 program document laid out 16 indicative triggers/actions for DPSP-2.9 In \nthe  process  of  assessment  of  implementation  progress  of  these  actions,  the  Government \nproposed a few key changes: \n \n(i)  Replace the action on drafting a Trade Law with that of the Warehouse Receipts \nLaw (no. 5 in the policy matrix presented in Appendix 3, Table A3.1): At the time of \nDPSP-1 negotiations in November 2005, it was expected that the trade bill would \nhelp to ensure the free movement of goods within the country and a competitive \ntrade regime. An initial assessment of the draft law pointed to considerable work \nstill needed to bring the provisions in line with the original objectives as envisioned \nlast year by the Ministry of Trade. Moreover, changes to the cabinet\u2019s economic \nteam brought forth several new initiatives and a policy package in the investment \nclimate\u2014none of which identified the trade law as a priority for 2006. At the request \nof the Government, it is proposed that this trigger be dropped10 and replaced with \nthe  adoption  of  the  Warehouse  Receipts  Law  (Table  A3.1,  no.  5)\u2014important \nlegislation which will help the development of SMEs and facilitate domestic trade. \n(ii)  Consolidate two triggers on nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) into one trigger \n(Table A3.1, no. 7). \n(iii)  Consolidate two triggers on government financial accounting and reporting into one \ntrigger (Table A3.1, no. 11). \n(iv)  Add  three  new  triggers  on  tax  administration  reform  (Table  A3.1,  no.  13), \ngovernance (Table A3.1, no. 14), and civil service reform (Table A3.1, no. 15). \n   \n \n25.  In total, the Government and development partners have focused on 16 policy actions as \nidentified in Table A3.1 in Appendix 3.11 Most of these triggers contained multiple measures as \na means of clearly outlining a blueprint for government counterparts to follow and execute at the \ntechnical level, while a few measures had definitive outputs (e.g., establishment of an office or \nbody).  The  16  policy  actions  comprise  39  specific  measures.  The  Government  has  made \nsubstantial progress toward completing these measures: 28 have been fully completed, while \ncontinuous progress has been underway in the remaining 11 measures, which the Government \nis committed to fulfilling during 2007.  \n \n26.  In the spirit of the DPL series, which aims to support the Government\u2019s policy reform \nagenda on a continuous basis rather than through pre-determined rigid conditionalities, the \nGovernment has requested that recognition be given to the substantial progress that has been \nmade. Furthermore, as the individual loans under the DPL series are sequenced to provide \ncontinuous support in a predictable manner, it has requested the development partners to stay \nfully engaged as part of the ongoing policy dialogue, and support and continuously monitor the \nimplementation and completion of the 10 measures. ADB\u2019s program cluster approach provides \nfor such flexibility in reform programs that are implemented over a period of time, by taking \n                                                 \n8 This section should be read along with the background information presented in Appendix 2 on the DPSP-2   \ntriggers.

Manila (November). \n10 The Government has requested that the Trade Law may be picked up in a subsequent operation in the near future. \nThe World Bank and United States Agency for International Development (USAID), among others, provide \ntechnical assistance in a number of related areas. \n11 The DPL-3 document of the World Bank includes an additional trigger on risk management in the infrastructure \nsectors. This trigger is not included in DPSP-2 since it is covered in a more extensive manner in the ADB \nsupported IRSDP. \n ", "  11\nemerging circumstances into account. The triggers identified for DPSP-3 (DPL-4), presented in \nAppendix  3,  Table  A3.2,  include  measures  to  ensure  policy  continuity  as  well  as  close \nengagement between the Government and development partners in the implementation of \nthese ongoing measures. \n \n1.  Core Policy Area I: Supporting Macroeconomic Stability and \nCreditworthiness \n27.  General Progress and Constraints under Core Policy Area I. As outlined earlier \n(paras.2-6), Indonesia has been quite successful in restoring and reestablishing macroeconomic \nstability since the Asian financial crisis. In particular, successive administrations have focused \non fiscal consolidation and monetary stability, and paved the way for some key structural \nreforms. The first phase of the DPL supported the adoption and implementation of the white \npaper  reforms,  with  ADB  engagement  through  several  parallel  operations  (footnote  3). \nSubsequently,  the  hallmark  of  macroeconomic  management  during  DPSP-1  was  the  bold \ndecision to increase domestic fuel prices, reflecting strong government commitment despite \nshort-term pain. As a result of the adjustments, there was an additional fiscal space of $5 billion \nin 2005 and approximately $10 billion in 2006. This could enable one of the largest public \nexpenditure reorientations in recent history in any country toward higher priority social areas. \n \n28.  At a broader level, many indicators have improved in recent years. Most noteworthy \nhave  been  improvements  in  market  perception,  demonstrated  through  (i)  upgrading  of \ninternational credit ratings; (ii) the significant decline in public debt-to-GDP ratio by almost 20% \nfrom about 64% in 2003 to 45% in mid-2006; and (iii) the significant shift in revenue sources, as \ndomestic non-oil and gas revenues are projected to comprise about 13.6% in 2006, from 10.4% \nin 2003. These underlie the stable recovery of Indonesia\u2019s economy toward one of the highest \ngrowth rates among similarly sized economies in the region. As a result of these outcomes, the \nGovernment and the development partners have agreed that the next phase of DPSP (DPSP-3 \nand DPL-4) will continue the policy dialogue on macroeconomic stability but with the intention of \neliminating the separate pillar focused on these issues. This decision testifies to the general \nconfidence in the Government\u2019s commitment to sound macroeconomic management, based on \na convincing track record.   \n \n29.  Despite these positive outcomes, the Government needs to address a number of other \nissues. One such impediment is the subsidy policy in the power sector. While the fuel price \nhikes of March and October 2005 significantly reduced a major distortion in the economy, retail \nprices for gasoline and kerosene remain at 70% and 30% of international prices, respectively. \nSince the energy mix tilted predominantly towards oil, particularly in electricity generation, the \ncosts of electricity generation have shot up in Indonesia. As a result, increasing fuel prices have \nled to a significant rise in subsidies required by PLN. Subsidy needs in 2006 are estimated at \nRp37 trillion ($3.8 billion) or more than double the level in 2005. With regard to tariff policies in \ngeneral, there is lack of coordination within the Government, leading to a disconnect between \ndevelopment  priorities  and  tariff  setting.  The  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development \nProgram  (IRSDP)12  supported  by  ADB  will  provide  significant  support  to  achieve  full  cost \nrecovery in all infrastructure sectors. The Government faces considerable challenges in the area \nof decentralization. Fiscal transfer mechanisms need to be streamlined. Regional tax reforms to \nincrease fiscal autonomy have to be accelerated.     \n \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program. Manila (November). \n   ", "12  \n30.  Triggers under Core Policy Area I. The Government has progressed in fulfilling the \nthree triggers in this policy area, which build on and deepen reforms undertaken in the previous \nphases relating to tax and fiscal policy, debt management, and decentralization. Beyond the \nspecific triggers, the Government has also made progress across a broad range of policy and \ninstitutional measures in these areas. \n \na.  Improving Fiscal Policy \n31.  Key Issues. The overriding objective of the Government\u2019s fiscal reform efforts has been \nto enhance the amount and predictability of tax revenues through improved compliance and \nbroadening the tax base, while reducing tax rates to improve investment sentiment. In the past \nseveral years, the Government has increased taxpayer registration and filing of tax returns by \nnew and existing taxpayers, and has improved recovery of tax arrears and expanded audit \ncoverage.  In  December  2004,  electronic  registration  of  taxpayers  was  introduced,  as  was \nelectronic  filing  in  January  2005.  Earlier  support  through  the  DPL  has  facilitated  the \nmodernization of tax offices, including upgrading facilities and information technology systems, \nstaff reorganization by function, increased remuneration, and the institution of taxpayer bill of \nrights and tax official code of conduct. The extension of modern tax offices continued in 2006, \nwith a major expansion to medium sized tax offices in Indonesia, and through the beginning of a \nreorganization of the central tax office to support the longer-term tax reform agenda (core policy \narea 3). \n \n32.  However, many problems remain despite progress in extending the modern tax office \nsystem.  The  tax  system  is  still  characterized  by  relatively  low  revenue  generation,  poorly \ndefined and overly complicated taxes (i.e., creating excessive compliance costs), and poor and \ninconsistent enforcement (i.e., creating uncertainty and abuse). The problem requires better \noversight of tax officials, and partly stems from a systematic lack of information and capacity for \ntax and customs analysis outside tax and customs offices. The lack of capacity has led to an \ninability  to  accurately  assess  and  forecast  the  implications  of  proposed  tax  and  customs \nchanges; reduced checks and balances; and an imbalance between taxpayer and government \nrequirements.  \n \n33.  Accomplishments  under  DPSP-2.  The  first  round  of  MOF  reorganization  was \nsupported  through  DPSP,  in  line  with  the  approach  adopted  in  the  State  Finance,  State \nTreasury, and State Audit laws adopted in 2003\u20132004 to separate all non-fiscal responsibilities. \nWithin the broader context of the DPSP-2 policy dialogue, the minister of finance proposed a \nsecond phase of MOF institutional reorganization to be implemented over 2006\u20132007. This was \ndone through the adoption of a revised and strengthened 5-year strategic plan for MOF (MOF \nDecree No. 84/2006, issued on 14 February 2006). The strategy aims to improve the quality of \noverall  fiscal  management,  including  debt,  risks,  and  contingent  liabilities;  and \nintergovernmental  fiscal  relations,  among  others.  To  help  implement  the  strategic  plan \neffectively, the Government adopted Presidential Regulation No. 66/2006 on 8 June 2006, on \nthe reorganization of MOF. As part of this, MOF has established a Fiscal Policy Office (BKF), \nwhich replaces the Agency for Economic and Financial Sector Research and International \nCooperation, with the aim of separating fiscal policy formulation and implementation within MOF \nto address the weaknesses described above. The reorganization also entails the creation of two \nnew directorate generals (DGs) to consolidate all functions related to debt management and \nregional fiscal balance. \n \n34.  On 1 November 2006, an echelon 1 (the highest level within the civil service) official was \nappointed to head BKF, supported through a presidential decree. Officials at subsequent levels \nhave  been  appointed  through  an  MOF  decree.  ADB,  Australian  Agency  for  International \n ", "  13\nDevelopment (AusAID), and World Bank will support BKF in a range of areas. The World Bank\u2019s \nGovernment Financial Management and Revenue Administration Project (GFMRAP) will focus \non strengthening institutional arrangements. AusAID supports tax policy reforms. ADB\u2019s ongoing \nsupport focuses on strengthening risk management in infrastructure, a key function of BKF, \nthrough  a  new  risk  management  unit.  The  Government  has  also  begun  the  process  of \ninstitutionalizing the transfer of tax, sectoral, and other data to BKF to improve forecasting \naccuracy, which will report the data on a monthly basis to the cabinet economics team. \n \n35.  Expected Impact. The fulfillment of trigger 1 entails improved overall fiscal policy as \ndemonstrated  through  good  quality  analytical  assessments,  better  coordination,  and  timely \naccess to key information. Given the Government\u2019s current focus on accelerating development, \nBKF will undertake wide-ranging assessments to guide policy. Its initial focus will be on taxes \nand trade policy. Streamlining fiscal transfers will receive priority attention in light of concerns on \nequity and efficiency in their distribution, and the relatively low levels of accountability from local \ngovernments to their own citizens and the national Government in fulfilling key priorities such as \ninvestment climate improvement, poverty reduction, and acceleration of MDGs. \n  \nb.  Improve Debt Management \n36.  Accomplishments.  The  Government  adopted  a  debt  management  strategy  under \nDPSP-1. To help implement the strategy effectively, a new DG for Public Debt Management has \nbeen established in MOF by consolidating the current bifurcated functions dealing with the \nissuance and management of government securities and external funds.13 An echelon 1 official \nhas been appointed as the director general. The new DG will be structured along functional \nlines\u2014front, middle, and back office\u2014to facilitate effective debt and risk management. A key \naspect of the debt management strategy is to deepen the understanding of relative costs and \nrisks of financing through various modalities, such as market and other sources. In addition, a \nsound assessment of the civil service pension liabilities needs to be undertaken on a continuous \nbasis. ADB has provided support in 2004 to undertake financial audits of key institutions dealing \nwith  government  and  private  sector  pensions.  Building  on  the  past  assessments,  the \nGovernment has recently signed a grant agreement from the Financial Sector Reform and \nStrengthening Initiative Trust fund which will provide capacity building support. \n \n37.  Expected Impact. Fulfillment of trigger 2 will entail continuous improvements to the debt \nmanagement strategy, including streamlined issuance of public debt and increased attention on \ncivil  service  pensions.  Transparency  will  be  enhanced  through  the  publication  of  a \ncomprehensive annual report on debt and risks, and the launching of a website containing \nrelevant information for investors and the public. The impact will be in the form of gradual \nreduction in public debt in proportion to GDP toward the Government\u2019s target of 30% by 2010. \nThe Government is set to achieve this target, as the forecast ratio for the end of 2006 is about \n38%. Equally important, the consolidation of debt management functions will help Indonesia \noptimize its sources of development financing in line with interest rate movements and other \nterms and conditions, including costs and benefits. \n \nc.  Improve Decentralization Framework \n38.  Accomplishments.  Following  the  adoption  of  the  new  Planning  Law  in  2004,  the \nGovernment began to integrate the planning and budgeting process. An essential part of this is \nto  strengthen  the  system  in  place  for  development  financing.  The  National  Development \nPlanning Agency (BAPPENAS) has adopted a new decree (Decree No. 5/2006) setting out a \nnew system comprising an annual and a 5-year rolling catalogue of development assistance \n                                                 \n13 Directorate of Government Securities Management and the Directorate for External Funds. \n   ", "14  \n(the blue book) process. One improvement is the requirement on line ministries to set aside \ncounterpart funds in their annual budgets, to ensure their readiness to receive and effectively \nabsorb official development assistance. In addition, the minister of finance has signed the on-\ngranting (MOF Decree No. 52/2006) and onlending (MOF Decree No. 53/2006) decrees. The \nnew  decrees  will  strengthen  the  channeling  of  development  assistance  to  the  regions.  In \nparallel, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is supporting MOF in \ndrafting the ministerial decree on the issuance of regional bonds. The Capital Markets and Non-\nBank Financial Institutions Supervisory Agency (BAPEPAM-LK) has begun work on the related \ntechnical  and  implementation  guidelines.  With  regard  to  local  government  debt  workout14, \ntechnical guidelines have been prepared by DG Treasury for restructuring and rescheduling \nPDAMs as well as local government loans. \n \n39.  Expected Impact. The adoption of the blue book and on-granting decrees will help \nstreamline and accelerate development assistance to the poorer regions or through nationally \nimplemented projects. However, onlending arrangements are likely to go through some further \ndifficult changes and tightening of conditions, as the Government has not been successful in \nrestructuring local government arrears. In the meantime, the issuance of subnational debt or \nsupport  through  market-based  means  of  raising  resources  for  development  needs  to  be \nfacilitated. The measures will help enhance the creditworthiness of subnational government \nborrowers; increase access to finance in the form of bonds, loans, and grants for subnational \ndevelopment; and stimulate public service delivery and regional growth.  \n \n2.  Core Policy Area II: Improved Investment Climate \n \n40.  General  Progress  and  Constraints  Figure 3.

Lost  investments  have \ntranslated into slower growth, and in turn slow  35 Malaysia Korea Thailand\nprogress in poverty reduction and job creation.  30\nSuch low levels of investment have impeded \n25\nIndonesia from competing effectively with the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Viet Nam,  20\nwhich have enjoyed high investment ratios of \n15\nIndonesia\n45% and 32% of GDP, respectively (Figure 3).  Philippines\nThe most critical challenge facing Indonesia  10\n1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005  \ntoday  is  how  to  improve  its  investment \nSource: World Bank, 2006 \nclimate.  Weaknesses  in  this  regard  were \nNote: Korea is Republic of Korea. \nclearly identified at the outset of the current \nadministration in the RPJM. The Indonesian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry \nprovided  a  road  map  for  improving  the  business  environment,  and  the  Government  and \ndevelopment partners have outlined five high priority policy areas: (i) taxation, (ii) customs \nclearance and tariff system, (iii) labor regulation, (iv) infrastructure, and (v) investment policy \nand SME promotion. \n \n41.  Although businesses continue to face significant constraints, there has been steady \nprogress. The investment ratio has increased since 2003, from 19% of GDP to 22% in 2005, \nand a projected 23% for 2006. Inflows of foreign direct investment more than doubled in 1 year \n                                                 \n14 Continuing on work supported by ADB\u2019s LGFGR Sector Development Program, which resulted in Government \nRegulation No. 14/05 and MOF Decree No. 107/05 on regional water utilities (PDAMs). \n ", "  15\nfrom $1.0 billion in 2004 to $2.3 billion in 2005. Overall investment (foreign and domestic) rose \nstrongly during the first half of 2005, by 15% over the previous year, and outpacing consumption \nas the main contributor to economic growth. While the October 2005 macroeconomic shocks \nreversed  some  of  those  gains,  the  return  to  macroeconomic  stability  suggests  improved \nprospects in the medium term. Business confidence has strengthened over the past few years, \nwith the rupiah among the top six best-performing currencies tracked by Bloomberg this year, \nand the equity markets one of the best performers in the region in 2004 and 2005. Business \nperceptions about the investment climate have also improved significantly over 2003\u20132005. \n \nFigure 4. Constraints to Investment  42.   Yet, considerable constraints \n(% of firms reporting constraint   to  the  investment  climate  exist \nto be moderate to very severe)  despite progress, and an acceleration \nof reforms is needed to return to the \nlevel  of  investment-led  growth \nenjoyed prior to the crisis. Investment \nclimate  surveys  conducted  in  2003 \nand  December  2005  indicate  that \nconstraints  to  businesses  are  less \nsevere than 2 years ago (Figure 4). \nHowever,  the  rankings  of  obstacles \nchanged  very  little.  Macroeconomic \ninstability,  policy  uncertainty,  and \ncorruption  were  ranked  as  the \nbiggest  obstacles  in  both  periods. \nThe  next  biggest  constraints  were \nweaknesses  in  the  legal  system, \ntransportation,  labor  skills,  tax \nadministration, cost of financing, and \nlabor  regulation  (December  2005 \nsurvey). To address these issues, the \nGovernment undertook a good deal \nSource: ADB for 2003 survey; World Bank for 2005/06 surveys  of  planning  and  preparation  for \ninvestment  climate  reforms  in  2005,  with  the  most  significant  investment-related  initiatives \nembodied in three new draft laws on tax, customs, and investment. Following the cabinet \nreshuffle in December 2005, a comprehensive investment climate policy package was issued in \nMarch 2006 through Presidential Instruction No. 3/2006. The package has time-bound targets \nand assigns a minister to be responsible for each target. It is divided into five categories, along \nthe lines of what was presented by the development partners in 2005: (i) general investment \npolicies, (ii) customs, (iii) tax, (iv) labor policy, and (v) SME policy. The Government needs to \nshow concrete progress in implementation, given the general skepticism expressed by the \nbusiness community with regard to effective enforcement of well-intentioned policies, plans, and \nregulations. \n \n43.  Recognizing the importance of implementation, the Government established an internal \nmonitoring team to provide monthly progress reports for the policy package. In May 2006, the \nteam noted that, out of 26 items scheduled for completion by the end of April, 23 had been \ncompleted and 3 were in the process of finalization. Among important measures completed in \nMarch and April were: (i) submission of the draft investment law to parliament; (ii) revitalization \nof the national export and investment team; (iii) simplification of eight business licenses under \nthe minister of trade, including the important Trade Business License; (iv) delegation of authority \nto  legalize  limited  liability  companies  to  provincial  offices  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice; \n   ", "16  \n(v) establishment  of  a  team  to  review  nonbusiness-friendly  local  regulations;  and \n(vi) simplification of procedures for granting visas and residence permits to foreign investors and \nexpatriate employees. \n \n44.  Labor reform is one of the most sensitive areas critical to improving the investment \nclimate. Revisions to Labor Law 13/2003 were proposed for April 2006 as part of the investment \npolicy package. However, following a strong negative reaction from organized labor, the April \ntarget could not be met. This represented a setback for investors as the 2003 law significantly \nraised hiring costs. For example, severance pay rates are now far higher than in other regional \neconomies,  discouraging  employers  from  hiring  new  workers  on  a  permanent  basis.  The \nproposed  changes  would  have  addressed  this  bias  against  employers  and  brought  labor \nregulations  into  line  with  neighboring  countries  such  as  Thailand  and  Malaysia.  The \nGovernment seems to have indicated a reluctance to push through such a politically charged \nreform  measure,  instead  stating  the  need  to  improve  relations  between  employees  and \nindustry\u2014and only if absolutely needed would amend the labor law. \n \n45.  The Government adopted a policy package on infrastructure in February 2006. ADB, \nworking closely with the National Committee on the Acceleration of Infrastructure Development \nand other development partners, is leading implementation support for the package through the \nproposed IRSDP, which sets out a medium-term agenda of policy and regulatory reforms aimed \nat accelerating infrastructure investments, a key ingredient of sound investment climate. The \nWorld  Bank  and  Government  of  Japan  are  considering  cofinancing  the  IRSDP,  at  the \nGovernment\u2019s request. \n \n46.  Triggers under Core Policy Area II. The DPSP cluster supports high level reform \nmeasures  involving  the  legal,  institutional,  and  regulatory  framework;  customs  and  taxes; \ninfrastructure development; SME promotion; financial sector development; and trade. Moving \nforward,  the  investment  climate,  infrastructure,  finance,  and  SME  policy  packages  should \nprovide a strong foundation for continuity of policy reforms.   \n \nd.  Clarify the Legal Status of Regional Government Enterprises \n47.  Accomplishments. There has been no coherent legal framework governing the regional \ngovernment-owned enterprises (BUMDs), and the law on national state-owned enterprises does \nnot focus on BUMDs. The Ministry of Home Affairs has now coordinated the finalization of a \nnew draft Law on Regional Government Owned Enterprises, which aims to rationalize public \nand private participation in the BUMD sector. The new law will distinguish between those \nBUMDs which should be fully owned by their respective subnational governments, and those \nwhose ownership may be split between public and private entities. The latter type of BUMDs \nwould be prime targets for full privatization in the future. The new law is also expected to define \nmore  clearly  the  fiscal  and  financial  relationships  between  BUMDs  and  their  subnational \ngovernments,  regulate  BUMD  borrowing,  and  make  provisions  for  BUMD  bankruptcy.  The \nsubmission of the draft law by the President to parliament (trigger 4) is expected in early \nDecember 2006; the Government has agreed to follow through closely. \n \n48.  Expected Impact. Enactment of the law on BUMD will facilitate greater private sector \nparticipation  in  certain  key  sectors,  such  as  water  supply  and  sanitation.  By  laying  out  a \nframework  for  restructuring  BUMDs,  it  will  also  help  improve  the  quality  of  public  service \ndelivery,  particularly  in  the  provision  of  regional  infrastructure  services,  through  improved \nmanagement and restructuring. \n \n \n \n ", "  17\ne.  Adopt a Legal Framework for Warehouse Receipts to Support \nFinancial Intermediation \n \n49.  Accomplishments. In June 2006, Parliament enacted the Warehouse Receipt Law \n(trigger 5) to establish a system of designated warehouses which could provide official centrally \nregistered receipts for commodities stored by farmers, growers, and traders. This means that \nSMEs in agribusiness and related sectors would have flexibility in selling their products based \non market conditions. The designated warehouses will provide them with certificates against \ngoods held. The receipts can be traded as derivatives, used to settle maturing futures contracts \non a commodities exchange, or as collateral to obtain bank loans. \n \n50.  Expected  Impact.  Enactment  of  the  Warehouse  Receipts  Law  will  help  expand \nfinancing opportunities for SMEs, as the lack of uncollateralized lending has been a major \nimpediment to financial intermediation. The Ministry of Industry will disseminate information on \nthe scheme and draw up technical guidelines to implement the approved legislation. \n \nf.  Continue Implementation of the Financial Sector Safety Net \n51.  Accomplishments. Introduction of the deposit insurance system was supported under \nthe  first  two  phases  of  the  DPL.  Its  implementation  is  proceeding  according  to  schedule \n(trigger 6). As announced, on 22 March 2006 the coverage was reduced to Rp5 billion. It is \nexpected that it will be further reduced to Rp1 billion from 22 September 2006. The last step will \nbe a reduction to Rp100 million, starting from 22 March 2007. In line with the implementation of \nthe deposit insurance scheme, on 28 December 2005, the minister of finance, BI governor, and \nthe  chair  of  the  Deposit  Insurance  Company  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to \nestablish the Financial Stability Forum, which will formulate policies to prevent and resolve \nsystemic financial crises. \n \n52.  Establishment of an Emergency Financing Facility (EFF). Following the agreement \nto  establish  the  Financial  Stability  Forum,  BI  has  adopted  a  regulation  (No. 8/1/PBI/2006) \nestablishing an EFF. The EFF will be available for large and systemic banking institutions which: \n(i) experience a liquidity crunch, (ii) have a capital adequacy ratio of at least 5%, and (iii) could \nguarantee the liquidity support from EFF with adequate collateral. The regulation clearly sets out \nthe  division  of  responsibilities  between  the  governor  of  BI  and  the  minister  of  finance  in \nimplementing  the  EFF,  besides  defining  the  criteria  for  determining  the  timing  of  such \nemergency support. The funds for the EFF will come from the state budget, in conformity with \nthe provisions of the State Finance Law (Law 17/2003).   \n \n53.  Adoption  of  Good  Corporate  Governance  (GCG).  In  continuation  of  the  banking \nsector  measures  adopted  under  the  first  DPSP,15  BI  has  adopted  a  regulation  (No. \n8/4/PBI/2006) on implementation of GCG practices in commercial banks. Adopted within the \nbroader framework of the Indonesian Banking Architecture plan of BI, which aims to consolidate \nand strengthen the banking sector by 2010, the regulation sets out a clear framework on GCG \nin banks. Box 1 presents the key features of the regulatory framework. Indonesia\u2019s banking \nsector  has  suffered  from  serious  corporate  governance  violations  in  the  past.  While \nimprovements have been made in the last 3\u20134 years, enforcement of GCG has not been even \nor effective. For instance, the fit and proper test requirements have not always been followed \nprior  to  the  appointments.  Repeated  concerns  have  been  expressed  in  relation  to  weak \ncorporate governance in state-owned commercial banks, which still account for over 50% of the \n                                                 \n15 DPSP (see para. 58 of the December 2005 ADB DPSP Board Report) recognized a range of measures adopted by \nBank Indonesia that broadly aim at strengthening financial system soundness. These were not covered in the \noriginal DPL triggers, but noted in the DPSP as part of the financial safety net provisions.  \n   ", "18  \nbanking assets. However, the adoption of the GCG regulation holds promise, in that it sets out \nclear principles and sanctions. Combined with the introduction of the deposit insurance scheme, \nand with greater information becoming available to consumers, the regulation could provide an \neffective self-disciplining device for commercial banks. \n \n  Box 1: Regulatory Framework on Good Corporate Governance in Commercial Banks \n \nOn 30 January 2006, the governor of Bank Indonesia adopted a regulation defining the principles of good \ncorporate governance to be adopted in all commercial banks in Indonesia. The key features of this \nregulation are outlined below: \n\u2022  Board of commissioners (BOC) and board of directors shall each comprise no less than three \nmembers, with at least 50% of them independent \n\u2022  All members of both boards shall pass a fit and proper test conducted by Bank Indonesia \n\u2022  The  BOC  shall  form  at  least  three  committees  dealing  with  risk  management,  audit,  and \nremuneration and nomination \n\u2022  The BOC will be held legally liable to inform Bank Indonesia of any violation of financial and \nbanking laws and regulations, or conditions that may endanger the bank, within 7 days of such \nviolation or availability of such information \n\u2022  The BOC shall also be responsible for ensuring that the prevailing regulations on large exposure \nare complied with; if not, such violations reported to Bank Indonesia \n\u2022  Banks should submit good corporate governance implementation reports within 5 months of the \nfiscal year; every day of delay will attract a fine of Rp1 million ($120) up to 1 month, and a fine of \nRp100  million  ($12,000)  thereafter.

Expected Impact. To date, there has been no adverse impact in terms of flight to quality \nof  deposits  arising  from  the  phased  removal  of  the  blanket  guarantee.  However,  the  last \nreduction in March 2007 may pose challenges\u2014a factor that the Government and BI are aware \nof, and are taking steps to monitor closely. The introduction of EFF provides a structured \nframework for crisis resolution, and thereby promotes overall public confidence. For the first \ntime, Bank Indonesia has adopted GCG principles, adherence to which will enhance financial \nsystem stability. As the fit and proper tests will require capacity within banks as well as Bank \nIndonesia, the system is likely to take some time and effort to establish and run properly. The \nenforcement of GCG should also be pursued vigorously, particularly in state-owned commercial \nbanks which have had specific governance related problems in the last few years. \n \ng.  Improve the NBFI Regulatory Framework \n55.  Accomplishments. The minister of finance adopted an action plan in December 2004, \nas part of the Financial Governance and Social Security Reform Program, to merge the capital \nmarket  and  financial  institution  supervision  functions,  to  eventually  pave  the  way  for  an \nintegrated financial system regulator (OJK). Several key steps have been taken for the merger \nof the Capital Markets Supervisory Authority (BAPEPAM) and the DG of Financial Institutions \n(DGFI), and necessary personnel changes have been made (trigger 7.1). An echelon 1 official \nhas been appointed to head the new entity, clearly paving the way for consolidating the NBFI \nsupervision efforts. BAPEPAM-LK is working to improve the operation of the merged regulators \nand increase the capacity of its staff. AusAID and ADB are supporting the transformation as well \nas providing training and human resource development assistance to BAPEPAM-LK staff. In \n ", "  19\nline with the action plan supported under FGSSR16, the current position of the minister of \nfinance is that the current BAPEPAM-LK should be made independent as soon as possible\u2014\nand its capacity further strengthened\u2014instead of waiting until 2010 for the establishment of \nOJK. An independent and strong regulator would form the basis for the OJK, which could be \nestablished by 2010, and is needed to develop a coherent policy and regulatory approach \nconducive to the development of NBFIs.  \n \n56.  On the Government\u2019s efforts to develop the NBFI sector, the financial sector policy \npackage lays out several key actions\u2014to be implemented within 12 months from July 2006\u2014\nthat would help strengthen these subsectors. In addition, a medium-term blueprint has been \nprepared in the capital market and preparations for implementation are under way. A pension \nfund road map was adopted in September 2006 and a similar road map is being prepared for \ninsurance  companies  (trigger  7.2).  To  help  strengthen  finance  companies,  MOF  Decree \nNo. 84/PMK.012/2006  was  adopted  in  August  2006.  In  parallel,  BAPEPAM-LK  has  issued \nguidelines on the resolution of financially unsound insurance companies (trigger 7.3). On the \noperational side, programs to ensure adequate technical capacity among pension funds and \ninsurance companies operators are now in place. The operating licenses of several insolvent \ninsurance companies have been revoked to clean up and consolidate the industry. In the \ncontext  of  the  IRSDP,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  policy  framework  to  set  up  an \ninfrastructure fund. It is also drafting the regulatory framework to help NBFIs participate in \ninfrastructure development (trigger 7.3).   \n \n57.  Expected Impact. Development of NBFIs is clearly an area that needs significantly \ngreater attention. The share of NBFIs in the financial system was 20.3% in December 2003. \nWhile it went up to about 24.5% in 2004, it has fallen to the 2003 level because of large-scale \nredemptions in the mutual fund industry in 2005. The goal of the DPSP cluster is to increase this \nshare to around 25\u201330% by 2008. The fragility of the sector has led to a clear recognition of the \nneed to strengthen NBFIs, with the minister of finance directly overseeing the efforts. Besides \ninstitutional strengthening of the new merged regulator, the establishment of an infrastructure \nfund is under way. Progress on development of a securitization law\u2014a key issue both for \ndevelopment of NBFIs and infrastructure finance\u2014potentially including submission of the law to \nparliament, is another expected output. ADB has provided advisory support in this area as part \nof ongoing efforts to strengthen the recently established Secondary Mortgage Facility. \n \nh.  Improve the Investment Climate Regulatory Framework \n58.  Accomplishments. The Government has made progress in a few key directions in this \narea. The Doing Business 2007 survey17 indicates that the time required to start a business in \nIndonesia has dropped from 151 days in 2005 to around 97 days in 2006 (trigger 8.1). However, \nseveral  issues  remain.  For  example,  there  are  numerous  redundant,  overlapping,  and \nexcessively  complex  business  licenses,  some  of  which  need  to  be  eliminated  and  others \nstreamlined. The number of steps to establish and register a limited liability company is still \nexcessive and should be reduced. The National Team for the Development of Exports and \nInvestments, coordinated by the minister of trade and reporting to the President, has been \nstrengthened to pursue its mandate of prioritizing sectors for exports and investments, and \nformulating  appropriate  policies  (trigger  8.2).  The  Government  is  also  pursuing  tax  reform \nmeasures (administrative reforms are dealt with under trigger 14) to boost investor confidence. \nWhile  the  adoption  of  the  package  of  tax  laws  has  been  delayed  by  over  a  year,  the \nGovernment and the business community have agreed in the interim to introduce a few key \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2002.

Washington, D.C. \n   ", "20  \nprovisions sought earlier but not introduced prior to the submission of the amendments to \nparliament  in  2005.  One  such  proposed  change  will  revoke  the  present  requirement  on \ntaxpayers to pay 100% of an assessment even while such an assessment may be under appeal \n(trigger 8.3). However, an administrative penalty of 100% will be imposed if the appeal fails to \nprevent taxpayers from filing frivolous disputes just to delay tax payments. It is expected that the \nrevised amendments will be completed and adopted by parliament by the end of 2006 to take \neffect in 2007. Finally, to improve the overall legal framework for investments, the first DPSP \nsupported  the  submission  of  a  draft  investment  law  to  parliament  in  2005.  Drafts  of  four \nimplementing regulations for the new investment law have been prepared to be adopted as \nsoon as parliament enacts the investment law, including investment procedures, the negative \nlist, integrated services, and investment incentives (triggers 8.4 and 8.5).     \n \n59.  Expected Outcome. Measures being adopted are expected to lower the transaction \ncosts of doing business and reduce business startup time gradually from 151 to 30 days. \nRegulatory measures on taxes and investment approvals will boost investor confidence. \n   \n2.  Core  Policy  Area  III:  Improved  Public  Financial  Management  and \nAnticorruption \n60.  Background. Indonesia has made significant progress in strengthening public financial \nmanagement  (PFM),  and  its  efforts  have  sparked  genuine  momentum  in  the  fight  against \ncorruption. Taken in line with the RPJM agenda and as part of the overall governance reforms \noutlined earlier, the PFM measures are beginning to have an impact on the way business is \ndone within the Government. At the national level, the Government aims to have a state-of-the-\nart PFM system in place by 2008, with support from the World Bank through the GFMRAP \nproject for ex ante (focusing on planning and budgeting) aspects of PFM, and with ADB support \nthrough the State Audit Reform SDP18 for the ex post aspects focused on internal controls and \naudits.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  on  procurement  set  out  the  basic  principles  of \nprocurement: transparency, open and fair competition, economy, and efficiency. It covers all \nareas of procurement that use public funds and is supposed to cover contracting entities at all \nlevels of government. Subsequently, the current Government reorganized MOF, including the \nseparation of the budget and treasury functions. Notable progress includes making the national \nbudget compatible with the international standard Government Financial Statistics classification \nand  establishing  a  Treasury  Single  Account  (TSA).  These  reforms  are  making  important \ncontributions to increasing the efficiency, transparency, and reducing corruption in PFM. \n \n61.  However, key indicators of government budget performance have not improved, most \nimportantly  the  pattern  of  disbursement.  Public  investment  from  the  central  Government \n(i.e., development expenditures) was consistently lower than its latest estimates. In addition, \nIndonesia still spends 50% of its capital expenditures in the last quarter of the year. For the last \n5 years, spending has started very slowly and then accelerated. This unhealthy pattern raises \nconcern. Economic activity is disrupted by an unnatural cycle; project implementation starts late \nor, as in the case of multiyear projects, is interrupted at the beginning of each year. \n \n62.  With respect to tax administration, despite progress on extending the modern tax office \nsystem, the tax system is still characterized by relatively low revenue generation, poorly defined \nand  overly  complicated  taxes  (i.e.,  creating  excessive  compliance  costs),  and  poor  and \ninconsistent enforcement (i.e., creating uncertainty and abuse). The problem requires better \noversight of tax officials, and partly stems from a systematic lack of information and capacity for \ntax and customs analysis outside tax and customs offices. The lack of capacity has led to an \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2004.

Triggers under Core Policy Area III. There are seven triggers under this area, focused \non (i) completing implementing regulations for the treasury and audit laws; (ii) further expanding \nthe TSA system; (iii) improving PFM reporting; (iv) setting up the National Procurement Policy \nOffice  (NPPO);  (v)  strengthening  tax  administration;  (vi)  supporting  anticorruption  through \nwitness protection measures; and (vii) initiating civil service reforms.      \n \na.  Implement Treasury and Audit Laws \n64.  Accomplishments. Progress has been under way in drafting a range of regulations \n(trigger 9). One key policy measure is pending since DPL-2 (the first DPSP) on the Government \nRegulation on State Cash Management, which is currently under interministerial review and \nexpected  to  be  approved  by  the  President  in  December  2006.  Bank  Indonesia  and  the \nGovernment have yet to reach agreement on remuneration on government cash balances under \nthe TSA. A government regulation has been adopted on State Asset Management [Peraturan \nPemerintan (PP) No. 6/2006] in April 2006, outlining the roles and responsibility of various \ninstitutions on asset management, valuation, oversight, disposal, etc. Three other government \nregulations are under drafting for the State Treasury Law: (i) internal control systems\u2014the \nfinalization  of  this  regulation  has  been  controversial  because  of  the  role  of  internal  audit \nagencies;19 (ii) budget implementation\u2014this regulation, covering budget payment and revenue \nmechanisms, is expected to be adopted by the end of 2006, to become effective from 2007; and \n(iii) state investment management\u2014covering all state infrastructure. With respect to the State \nAudit Law, BPK as the Supreme Audit Institution has been charged with the responsibility to \nfollow up with the respective regulations and memoranda of understanding. The latter pertain to \nthe issuance of auditing standards (Article 5), outsourcing of auditors (Article 9), guidance on \naudit summons (Articles 10,11), guidance on investigative audits (Article 13), guidance on \nsubmission of fraud in audit findings (Article 14), guidance on submission of audit reports to \nlegislative body (Article 17), and guidance on settlement of state losses (Article 22). Significant \nprogress has been made\u2014to date, BPK has drafted the auditing standards (Article 5), three \nimplementing regulations (Articles 9, 22, and 11), a concept manual for investigative auditing \n(Article  13),  and  two  memoranda  of  understanding  (Articles  14  and  17)  to  satisfy  the \nrequirements  of  the  State  Audit  Law.  The  BPK  Law  (Law  No.  15/2006)  was  enacted  on \n30 October 2006. It replaces Law No. 5/1973; complements the State Audit Law; and clarifies \nthe roles, responsibilities, and structure of BPK.   \n \n65.  Expected Impact. Along with the Law on State Finances, the State Treasury and State \nAudit laws form the most important legislation in Indonesia. The regulations and memoranda \nadopted will provide a sound framework for enhancing overall transparency and accountability, \nas all line agencies utilizing public resources will come under the purview of these regulations.  \n \nb.  Continue Implementation of the TSA \n66.  Accomplishments. Pilots for zero balance transitory accounts were begun under the \nfirst DPSP in Jakarta, Bekasi, and Batam; and extended to 50 State Treasury Offices (KPPNs) \nin September 2006 (trigger 10.1). Further implementation of TSA (expenditure and revenue \naccounts), with TSA implemented in all KPPNs, is proposed for mid-2007 in three phases: (i) all \n                                                 \n19 ADB\u2019s State Audit Reform SDP is providing implementation support here. The issue relates to the role of the \nGovernment\u2019s Internal Audit Agency and the significant human and other institutional resources at its disposal vis-\n\u00e0-vis its own mandate which has been considerably reduced in recent years. A small five-person interagency team \nhas been established to resolve the disagreement.   \n   ", "22  \nKPPNs with links to Bank Indonesia; (ii) KPPNs with their accounts outside BI in Java-Madura; \nand (iii) KPPNs with their accounts outside BI and located elsewhere. On 30 October 2006, \nMOF also piloted a national revenue module that automatically links revenue deposits\u2014tax, \ncustoms receipts, and other non-tax revenues\u2014into treasury systems. This pilot will end on \n31 December  2006,  when  the  system  is  expected  to  be  fully  operational.  A  more  rapid \nexpansion  of  the  TSA  can  be  accomplished  once  the  government  regulation  on  cash \nmanagement  and  the  ensuing  implementing  guidelines  are  adopted.  With  regard  to  the \nconsolidation of Regional Development Accounts and oil transitory accounts, the Government \nhas expressed interest in working with the development partners under DPSP-3 to monitor \nprogress. \n \n67.  Expected Impact. About 30,000 bank accounts are planned to reach zero balance in \n2006, resulting in an overnight sweep of about Rp10 trillion ($1.2 billion) into the TSA. Once \nexpanded, there will be significant benefits through improved cash management and enhanced \ntransparency. \n \nc.  Strengthen Budget and Financial Reporting and Accounting \n68.  Accomplishments.  In  the  area  of  reporting,  the  Government  has  demonstrated \nconsistent and sound progress since MOF reorganization in 2004. DG Treasury currently has \nthe ability to generate flash reports on budget disbursements and revenue receipts transactions \nconducted  through  KPPNs  and  the  State  Treasury.20  Delays  have  been  reduced  in  the \naggregation of KPPN transactions and their reconciliation with ministry work unit records by the \nDG Treasury regional offices. In the past, such differences have been significant, including \ndifferences  with  some  agencies  within  MOF,  such  as  the  tax  and  customs  and  excise \ndirectorates. In preparing the financial statements for FY2005, much effort was expended in \nidentifying and reducing such differences. Early in FY2006, a new system was set up whereby \nthe MOF and line agency reports must be reconciled on a monthly basis at KPPN level and on a \nquarterly basis at provincial DG Treasury office levels. The relevant instructions and operating \nmanuals to guide this process have been issued. These steps have resulted in a reduction in \nunreconciled differences.   \n \n69.  In addition, MOF has instituted a system to obtain from all KPPNs copies of the year-end \nbank  statements  of  the  operational  bank  accounts  under  their  management.  Pending  the \nintroduction of a TSA, this is seen as a positive interim measure to enforce greater reliability of \nbank  balance  figures  at  the  year-end  and  to  identify  cases  of  major  differences  between \nreported  and  actual  bank  balances.  Comparing  financial  statements  for  2004  and  2005, \nprogress has been made in the following principal areas: (i) improved reconciliation of income \nand  expenditure  between  DG  Treasury  and  line  ministries;  (ii)  improvements  in  timely \nproduction  of  annual  financial  statements;  (iii)  greater  comprehensiveness  of  financial \nstatements with data from an additional 21 agencies now included in the aggregation; (iv) \nimproved accountability from line ministries, with new requirements to submit budget realization \nreports with letters of representations signed and endorsed by the respective minister and \ninspector general; (v) improved reliability of financial reports through regular reconciliation of \nincome and expenditure, and verification of bank balances in accounts held by line ministries; \nand (vi) an expanded set of notes to accounts with disclosures on accounting policies, and \nsignificant transactions and inclusion of prior year figures for comparison. However, several key \nissues  still  need  to  be  addressed  to  accomplish  the  spirit  of  this  trigger  despite  these \nimprovements. These issues, which will be monitored during 2007 by the Government and the \n                                                 \n20 Mechanisms and procedures for the preparation of Budget Realization Reports are outlined in MOF Decree No. \n59/2005. \n ", "  23\ndevelopment partners, include: (i) the disclosure of some significant fund movements within the \nfinancial statements; and (ii) improved disclosure of movements of debt. \n \n70.  Expected Impact. Clearly, progress made to date has had a positive impact through \nenhanced  transparency.  By  facilitating  reconciliation,  the  new  regulatory  requirements \nintroduced have reduced the scope for any improper utilization of resources or misreporting. \nThe  trigger  will  be  fulfilled  upon  evidence  of  improved  quarterly  reports  by  organizational \nclassification, and regular reporting by functional and economic classifications\u2014published in the \npublic domain. \n  \nd.  Institutionalize Coordination Arrangements for National \nProcurement \n71.  Accomplishments. Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 on public procurement requires \nthat the NPPO be established by 1 January 2005. However, this has been a contentious issue, \nas line ministries and public agencies have resisted the NPPO idea out of concern that it will \ncentralize control. The draft decree on NPPO was recently endorsed by the minister of planning, \nbut it needs to be reviewed and cleared by other ministries concerned as the NPPO is part of a \nlarger and more complicated reorganization in BAPPENAS. However, significant work has been \nunder way in parallel in preparing for the establishment of the NPPO and developing institutional \ncapacity. For example, a centralized training and procurement practitioner\u2019s certification system \nis under development, with certification at various levels. The system has commenced targeting \ngovernment  procurement  practitioners  with  initial  certification  to  the  basic  level  through  a \ncomputerized  testing  system.  With  ADB  support,  the  directorate  on  public  procurement  in \nBAPPENAS (predecessor to the NPPO) has formulated standard bidding documents, which \nwould help standardize the procurement process across line agencies. Ideally, a national policy \nbody  should  have  sufficient  authority  across  all  levels  of  government  in  a  decentralized \nenvironment. Therefore, the NPPO would best be established as a stand-alone independent \nentity reporting directly to the President. However, given the political difficulties, an acceptable \ninterim solution may be that the NPPO is established as an independent entity reporting to the \nminister  of  planning  with  subsequent  empowerment  as  an  independent  entity  under  the \nproposed new procurement law. Its actual establishment will be monitored under DPSP-3. \n \n72.  Expected  Impact.  The  NPPO  will  help  make  public  procurement  transparent  by \nstreamlining  national  and  local  requirements.  By  harmonizing  regulatory  practices,  the \nGovernment\u2019s ongoing anticorruption drive will be significantly enhanced. \n \ne.  Strengthen Tax Administration \n73.  Accomplishments.  The  Tax  Department  has  proposed  a  new  structure  for  its \nheadquarters designed to refocus on functional issues including change management, risk \nmanagement,  monitoring  the  code  of  conduct,  internal  control,  research,  and  outreach \n(trigger 13). This is in contrast to the previous system focused on the type of tax. Such a change \nis expected to better focus the department\u2019s energy and resources on what is expected to be a \nlong-term reform process. The proposal has been approved by the President, as it varies from \nstandard civil service procedures.  \n \nf.  Promote Anticorruption and Transparency \n74.  The Government has made some notable progress on the anticorruption front. To gain \ncredibility,  the  Government  focused  initially  on  a  high  profile  anticorruption  campaign.  It \nstrengthened the institutional framework for anticorruption rather than targeting individuals. High \nprofile corruption investigations have been launched at every level of government and even \namong some state-owned enterprises. More than 100 investigations have been approved by the \n   ", "24  \nPresident,  targeting  mayors,  governors,  and  ministerial  level  officials;  these  have  led  to  a \nnumber of successful prosecutions. As a lesson from the expanded anticorruption drive, it has \nbecome clear that those who provide information should be given adequate protection under the \nlaw to encourage greater sharing of information on corruption.    \n \n75.  Accomplishments. Parliament enacted the Witness and Victim Protection Law in June \n2006 (trigger 14). The law mandates the establishment of a special commission and secretariat \nto ensure implementation of the provisions of the Law. A properly resourced commission and \nsecretariat  should  be  in  place  in  2007.  The  law  includes  both  whistleblower  and  witness \nprotection, and its passage would provide adequate safeguards for those providing information \nrelevant to legal cases.  \n \n76.  Expected  Impact.  The  passage  of  the  Witness  and  Victim  Protection  Law  is  an \nimportant breakthrough in facilitating anticorruption cases as it provides a comprehensive set of \nprotections for witnesses who testify in criminal cases, including corruption crimes. \n \ng.  Initiate Civil Service Reforms \n77.  Accomplishments.  In  line  with  recent  efforts  to  initiate  civil  service  reforms,  the \nGovernment has launched a job evaluation exercise for high-ranking state officials, beginning \nwith training a team of evaluators (trigger 15.1). Necessary regulation of the establishment of an \nindependent  Remuneration  Commission  has  been  drafted,  discussed  among  the  relevant \nagencies, and submitted to the state secretary for review (trigger 15.2). Progress on this front \ncould herald a new era in strengthening the civil service in Indonesia. \n \n3.  Core Policy Area IV: Improved Public Service Delivery \n78.  Background.  The  Government\u2019s  goal  to  reduce  poverty  is  exemplified  by  its  2005 \nreallocation of savings from fuel subsidy reductions to programs targeting the poor. The UCT \nprogram21 compensates poor and near-poor households for the short-term impact of fuel price \nincrease. The operational aid to schools and health insurance programs are expected to benefit \npoorer households by increasing access to primary health and basic education services through \nlower  (or  no)  fees,  while  the  village  infrastructure  program  is  intended  to  provide  village \ninfrastructure in less developed areas, and create employment. \n \n79.  In a few months leading up to the cuts in fuel subsidies, the Government rapidly set up a \nnationwide  UCT  program  (Rp300,000  or  $32  per  quarter  for  each  household)  covering \n15.5 million households. Designed to last 1 year, program improvements were made prior to \nissuing the second tranche of payments and an additional 3.7 million households were added as \nbeneficiaries. The Government is currently developing a CCT program to be implemented, \nstarting in six provinces in 2007, modeled on successful programs in other countries, notably in \nLatin America. The CCT has a short-term poverty reduction objective as well as a longer-term \ngoal  of  improving  human  capital  outcomes  for  the  poor.  In  addition  to  piloting  CCT  to \nhouseholds,  the  Government  plans  to  build  on  Indonesia\u2019s  extensive  experience  with \ncommunity-driven development projects by piloting a grant to communities to improve health \nand educational outcomes. \n   \n80.  Accomplishments. BAPPENAS undertook a rapid assessment of the UCT program in \nDecember 2005 in 15 districts/municipalities in 10 provinces. It used the findings to make \nchanges for disbursement of the second tranche of cash transfers, including (i) changes to the \nbeneficiary registry, (ii) improved public awareness, (iii) improved payment procedures, and \n                                                 \n21 Para.38 of ADB. 2005.

Manila (November). \n ", "  25\n(iv) modified  complaints  resolution  procedures.  Qualitative  assessments  of  the  education \nprograms  (in  five  provinces)  and  health  programs  (in  six  provinces)  were  undertaken  in \nMarch 2006 (trigger 16.1). The World Bank and ADB have provided TA support for these \nassessments.  Preliminary  findings  were  distributed  to  BAPPENAS  and  line  ministries  in \nApril 2006 in line with BAPPENAS\u2019 request to have the findings as an input to the Government\u2019s \nplanning and budgeting cycle. Final reports were disseminated in workshops for government \nand donor agencies in July 2006. The World Bank is undertaking a comprehensive analysis of \nthe household expenditure survey data to corroborate the findings of the assessments. A draft \nreport is expected in December 2006. BAPPENAS has utilized the lessons learned from the \nUCT and other public expenditure programs in the design of the CCT. In particular, several \nsteps have been taken to improve the UCT database for use in the CCT pilot, including devising \na better scoring system and weights, and adopting systematic approaches for targeting based \non estimates from poverty mapping. In November and December 2006, the National Statistics \nOffice will verify the eligibility of current UCT beneficiaries on the new scoring system in CCT \npilot districts. \n \n81.  Expected  Impact.  In  addition  to  emphasizing  changes  to  the  existing  programs, \nBAPPENAS  has  actively  utilized  lessons  learned  from  the  post-fuel  subsidy  compensation \nprogram assessments to make improvements to the design of the Government\u2019s CCT program, \nwhich it intends to pilot in 2007. Some of the key influences from the rapid assessment findings \nhave been in beneficiary targeting, utilization of the postal service to distribute funds; and \nrecognition that socialization and training have to be prioritized and carried out well in advance \nof program implementation, and that a working complaints mechanism is key to ensuring future \nprogram improvements.   \n \nD.  Monitoring the Impact of the DPSP Cluster \n82.  As part of the policy matrix for DPL-1 (prior to ADB\u2019s direct cofinancing involvement), \noutcome indicators were introduced to highlight the expected key results of the support. These \nindicators  were  taken  from  government  planning  documents.  The  results  framework  was \nsubsequently strengthened as part of DPL-2 (the first DPSP). Additional indicators have been \nadded  in  line  with  the  expansion  of  triggers  to  the  DPL  core  policy  areas.  Given  the \nGovernment\u2019s request to the World Bank and the latter\u2019s decision to extend the Program by \n1 year and to DPL-4, the targets for each outcome indicator have been updated to reflect the \nexpected outcomes by the end of 2008. These indicators are expected to provide the basis for a \ncomprehensive evaluation of the Program after DPL-4 (DPSP-3). Other indicators, such as the \nstandardized  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  used  to  assess  PFM,  would \nsupplement such an evaluation. However, like all policy-based lending, it would be difficult to \nattribute broad-based changes or development outcomes to specific policy actions under the \nDPL program, although the contribution of these triggers and the policy dialogue and analytic \nwork that underpin them could be discerned. \n \n83.  Overall, the Government is on course to meet most of the expected outcomes of the \nDPL program. The policy actions supported by the Program have helped to strengthen fiscal \npolicy,  and  in  so  doing,  helped  to  reduce  public  debt  levels  and  raise  non-oil  and  gas \nrevenues\u2014thus,  addressing  the  chief  concerns  among  investors  over  macroeconomic \ninstability. DPL-supported reforms have also reduced the burden on the business community, \ne.g., making it easier and less costly to register and license new businesses, and strengthening \nthe regulatory environment. Financial sector reforms have helped to diversify and strengthen the \nfinancial sector. On governance, the DPL program has helped accelerate reform measures \nrecommended by the CFAA, improving budget management, and making financial systems \nmore  transparent  and  effective.  Appendix  1,  Table  A1.1  details  progress  made  since  the \n   ", "26  \ninception of the Program on each of the DPL outcome indicators. Table A1.2 presents the DPL \nresults matrix presented in the World Bank\u2019s board document.22 \n \nE.  Forward-Looking Triggers for DPSP-323 \n84.  In deciding on the triggers for DPSP-3, there was agreement between the Government \nand the development partners that the focus of the DPL should reflect an emerging reform \nagenda that is transitioning from post-crisis macroeconomic stability, given the established track \nrecord in recent years of maintaining a stable macro-economy. Focus will remain on three key \npriorities: (i) improving the investment climate\u2014based on the Government\u2019s investment climate \nand financial sector strategies, and its emerging policy package on SMEs; (ii) improving PFM \nand anticorruption\u2014the recommendations spelled out in the CFAA of 2001 continue to be \nrelevant  and  the  selection  of  triggers  was  based  on  the  need  to  ensure  continued \nimplementation of government legislation to reform the institutional and regulatory framework for \nPFM; in this regard, DPSP-3 (DPL-4) will also broaden the policy agenda to include new and \nemerging priority areas, notably on governance, civil service reform, and anticorruption; and \n(iii) improving  public  service  delivery.  Thus,  greater  macroeconomic  stability  and \ncreditworthiness will become embedded within the Program as an objective and outcome, rather \nthan a separate core policy area. \n \n85.  Particular attention was also given to how triggers would facilitate achievement of the \nDPL program\u2019s expected outcomes, especially those where progress has been slower than \nexpected. In line with the program cluster approach adopted for DPSP, the proposed triggers \nbuild upon previous actions on specific policy issues.24 Appendix 3, Table A3.1 presents the \nindicative triggers for DPSP-3 (DPL-4) to be processed and implemented during 2007. As \noutlined in Figure 2, the implementation of DPSPs will be closely coordinated with the other \nsector-specific program loans on infrastructure, financial deepening, poverty reduction and MDG \nacceleration, and decentralization. \n \nF.  Financing Plan \n86.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $200 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance DPSP-2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; conversion options \nthat may be exercised in accordance with the draft loan agreement, the loan regulations, and \nADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft program \nloan agreement. The Government has made its own independent decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and it has given an undertaking that this choice was not \nmade on the basis of any advice from ADB. The Government envisages support from ADB of \naround $200 million for DPSP-3, which will be reconfirmed during 2007. \n \n87.  The  Government  aims  to  increase  development  spending  in  2006;  as  a  result,  it \nenvisages a higher fiscal deficit of \u20131.1% of GDP up from \u20130.5% in 2005. Amortization of debt \nwill be higher in 2006 at $6.5 billion against $4.1 billion in 2005 because of the end of Paris Club \nrescheduling arrangements. The Government has sought $1.3 billion in program loan financing \nfrom  ADB,  Japan,  and  World  Bank.  For  the  proposed  DPL-3,  the  World  Bank  envisages \n                                                 \n22 World Bank. 2006. Program Document for a Proposed Third Development Policy Loan to the Republic of \nIndonesia. Washington, D.C. (November). \n23  To be processed for Board Consideration in 2007, in parallel with DPL-4 coordinated by the World Bank. \n24 Table A2.2 in Appendix 2 of ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for Development Policy Support Program. Manila (December), provides an illustration of the \nsequencing of the reform measures over the medium-term. \n ", "  27\nproviding a $600 million program loan, comprising $530 million lent on International Bank for \nReconstruction  and  Development  terms,  and  $70  million  on  International  Development \nAssociation terms to help meet the reconstruction needs in Yogyakarta and Central Java. \n \n88.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  support  is  based  on  the  strengths  of  the  policy  package,  its \ndevelopment impact, the importance of the sectors covered, and the investment needs. Besides \nthe overall financing needs stemming from the greater focus on development spending, the \nGovernment will incur cash outlays, estimated at around $350 million, to implement many of the \ninstitutional strengthening measures supported under DPSP-2, such as modernization of tax \nadministration and establishment of BKF, among others.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n89.  The Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs (CMEA) will be the Executing Agency, \ncollaborating  closely  with  MOF.  Implementation  of  the  DPL-3/DPSP-2  actions  has  been \ncoordinated with a number of other ministries and agencies, including BAPPENAS, Ministry of \nTrade, Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs, and Bank Indonesia.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n90.  The reforms under DPSP-2 have been implemented during 2006, with actions in some \nareas continuing into 2007. The Government and the development partners will prepare a \nprogram completion report by mid-2007.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n91.  The  program  loan  of  $200  million  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding the items specified in the negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 6) and imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, the \nproceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the Republic of Indonesia as the Borrower. \nNo supporting import documentation will be required, if during each year that loan proceeds are \nexpected to be disbursed the value of Indonesia\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year. The \nGovernment  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. Disbursements will \nbe made under the simplified procedures for program loans.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption \n92.  ADB\u2019s  policy  Anticorruption  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nGovernment. In addition, the DPSP cluster has a core focus on improving governance and \nanticorruption.  It  promotes  transparency  in  PFM.  Noteworthy  progress  has  been  achieved \nthrough the TSA system, for instance, which will help the Government in its anticorruption \nefforts. The Program\u2019s focus on improving auditing framework will strengthen the independent \noversight  mechanisms  already  in  place.  The  recent  enactment  of  the  Witness  and  Victim \nProtection Law, supported by the Program, will help the special anticorruption agencies in their \nefforts. \n \n   ", "28  \n93.  The Government places significant emphasis on strengthening internal control systems \nand overall PFM, with support from the World Bank through the GFMRAP and from ADB \nthrough the State Audit Reform SDP. Reforms and capacity building initiatives supported under \nboth these programs have led to initial progress in strengthening PFM (Appendix 7). \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n94.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for the withdrawal applications. Prior to withdrawal, the Government \nwill open a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be \nmanaged, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n95.  CMEA, MOF, and BAPPENAS will continuously monitor the implementation of the DPL \nrelated reforms and their impact, in line with the overall program framework and outcome \nindicators agreed upon with the Government. The outcomes of each phase will be reviewed on \nan ongoing basis, and an overall evaluation of the program cluster will take place in 2008. \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n96.  The key benefits expected from the implementation of the DPSP cluster are as follows: \n \n(i)  Progress  in  meeting  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  objectives  of \n(a) macroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness,  (b)  improved  investment \nclimate, (c) anticorruption and improved governance, and (d) improved service \ndelivery. \n(ii)  Consolidation  of  recent  macroeconomic  and  policy  reforms  leading  to  the \nformulation of a credible medium-term public expenditure framework. \n(iii)  Aid harmonization and cofinancing by the key development partners (ADB, World \nBank,  and  Government  of  Japan)  around  a  common  policy  framework  and \ndialogue,  and  the  resulting  endorsement  of  the  Government\u2019s  sound  policy \nimplementation and macroeconomic management. \n(iv)  Facilitation,  through  crosscutting  reforms,  of  sector-specific  reforms  in  areas \nwhere ADB is providing or planning support. \n \n97.  Institutional.  Significant  benefits  stem  from  the  engagement  of  Indonesia\u2019s  three \nprincipal development partners. Participation in the DPL series has helped in overall institutional \ncoordination  among  the  partners  as  well  as  between  the  Government  and  the  partners. \nProvision  of  advisory  support  through  TA  has  also  been  significantly  streamlined  and \ncoordinated to best meet the Government\u2019s needs. The measures supported under the DPSP \ncluster will result in sustained institutional capacity in key areas of policy formulation such as \nfiscal policy, debt and treasury management, and public expenditure and financial management.  \n \n98.  Social. The main contribution of support being leveraged through DPSPs is in the form \nof improved public administration, sustaining effective public expenditure reorientation towards \nproductive needs, and continuously supporting government measures to effectively align its \nresources  with  its  medium-term  objectives  of  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  By \nfocusing  on  supporting  strategic  reforms  aimed  at  improving  public  service  delivery,  the \nProgram will have direct beneficial social impact. Appendix 8 presents a summary poverty \nreduction and social impact mitigation assessment. \n \n ", "  29\n99.  Economic. The nature of the DPSP series does not allow for quantitative financial and \neconomic analysis. However, significant general economic benefits will accrue to the entire \ncountry from the policy initiatives under the four core areas under the present phase. \n \n100.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environment. Implementation of the DPSP-2 \nmeasures will cause no direct or indirect involuntary resettlement, nor will it lead to any issues \naffecting indigenous peoples. Based on desk review, the measures supported under the DPSP-\n2 are unlikely to have any adverse environmental impacts. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n101.  The implementation of the DPSP cluster is subject to the following risks: \n \n(i)  Sustaining reforms. Economic volatility could worsen if the Government does \nnot sustain the reform momentum to follow up on the recent reduction in fuel \nsubsidies  (including  maintaining  appropriate  interest  rates  and  investment \nclimate reforms). External vulnerabilities are also a factor to be reckoned. This \nrisk is mitigated by the clear policy stance taken to date by the Government and \nBank Indonesia. The need for rapid policy adjustments in line with key global \ndevelopments is clearly recognized by both sides. The DPSP series has several \nmeasures  that  support  the  emergence  of  sustained  reforms,  and  assist  the \nGovernment in achieving overall macroeconomic stability.   \n \n(ii)  Fiduciary constraints. Notwithstanding the improvements under way, there are \ncontinuing concerns over the utilization of public resources. The overall fiduciary \nassessments  undertaken  since  2001  (with  the  CFAA)  have  indicated \nconsiderable improvements in the overall fiduciary environment in Indonesia. \nOngoing  programs  supported  by  several  development  partners  provide \nsignificant TA support to strengthen fiduciary governance. The focus on TSA \nimplementation will significantly enhance transparency. The DPSP cluster will \nhelp enhance overall accountability as well, as demonstrated for instance by \nsubmission  of  government-wide  financial  statements  to  parliament  and  their \nwidespread dissemination. \n \n(iii)  Coordination and capacity constraints. Effective implementation of reforms \nhas been stymied in the past by lack of coordination between ministries and \ngovernment agencies, and lack of capacity. Lack of such coordination could slow \ndown reform efforts. Changing incentives and improving performance orientation \nin the civil service, an area supported under the DPSP cluster, will be key in \nalleviating these constraints. Some ministries (e.g., MOF) have begun to promote \ncivil servants on the basis of merit rather than age or seniority. To address the \ncapacity  constraints,  the  Government  has  begun  to  use  TA  resources  more \neffectively for implementation purposes and on-the-job training. \n \n(iv)  Public opposition to reforms. The public and special interest groups generally \noppose tariff reforms and some aspects of investment climate reforms (such as \nlabor). The Government managed the fuel subsidy reduction well, while labor \nreforms have slowed down. The DPSP cluster allows for flexibility, enabling the \nGovernment to build consensus for reforms to ensure their acceptance.       \n \n(v)  Heightened  security  risks.  Alerts  stemming  from  sectarian  and  regional \nconflicts and terrorism could slow foreign direct investment and set back the \nrecovering tourism industry. The Government and law enforcement authorities \n   ", "30  \nhave  taken  a  range  of  measures  aimed  at  rebuilding  public  and  investor \nconfidence. \n  \nV.  ASSURANCES \n102.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the development needs as outlined \nunder the DPSP-2 implementation arrangements.  \n \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken prior to the date of the DPSP-2 loan agreement, \nas described in the development policy letter (including the policy matrix), will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of ADB\u2019s engagement in the DPL series, \nand subsequently. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n103.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n(i)   the program cluster in an aggregate amount not exceeding $400,000,000 to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Development Policy Support Program; and \n \n(ii)  the  loan  of  $200,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Second \nDevelopment Policy Support Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-based lending \nfacility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Program Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n27 November 2006 \n ", "    Appendix 1  31 \n     \nTABLE A1.1.

Trigger 1. Fiscal Policy. The Government of Indonesia (the Government) established a \nFinancial  Management  Reform  Committee  in  2002  to  help  prepare  a  comprehensive \nrestructuring of the institutional and legal architecture for fiscal management in Indonesia. The \ncommittee accomplished two key outputs. The first was to enact the laws to strengthen fiscal \nmanagement:  (i)  Law  on  State  Finance  (Law  No.  17/2003),  (ii)  Law  on  State  Treasury \n(Law No. 1/2004), and (iii) Law on State Audit (Law No. 15/2004). The second was to adopt a \nmajor overhaul of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to perform only fiscal functions, by separating \nall other non-fiscal responsibilities such as financial sector supervision, among others. The \nimplementation took place over 2004, when a new treasury was created, all budget functions \nwere consolidated into a directorate general to move towards a functional classification of the \nbudget, the Agency for Economic and Fiscal Research became operational, and the financial \nsector supervision functions moved to a separate agency. The broader thrust behind both steps \nhas  been  supported  by  the  Development  Policy  Loan  (DPL)/DPSP  process.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has supported in a number of related aspects, most notably a human \nresource  assessment  of  MOF,  facilitating  Financial  Management  Reform  Committee\u2019s \ndiagnostics. ADB also provided inputs to the laws and the related regulations. The World Bank \nhas supported through the formulation of its Government Financial Management and Revenue \nAdministration Project.  \n \n2.  Trigger  2.  Debt  Management.  Fiscal  consolidation  has  been  the  hallmark  of \nmacroeconomic management in Indonesia. A key part of this has been continuous improvement \nin debt management, an outcome supported by the DPL process. By the end of 2005, the ratio \nof debt to gross domestic product (GDP) had dropped to 47%, from 55% in 2004 and over \n100% in 1999. Even with the ongoing scaling up in public spending on education, health, and \ninfrastructure\u2014and  the  resulting  higher  fiscal  deficit  of  \u20131.1%  as  envisaged  in  the  2006 \nbudget\u2014fiscal sustainability should not be affected as long as international oil prices remain \nrelatively high. With this, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall below 30% in 2010. Under the \nfirst phase of DPSP/DPL-2, the Government adopted and began the implementation of a debt \nmanagement  strategy  (MOF  Decree  No.  06/2005),  which  was  presented  to  parliament  in \nSeptember 2005. The strategy outlined the risks to central government debt, the instruments \ncurrently available, and provided direction for decisions on borrowing and buybacks. DPSP-2 \naims to deepen this support. \n \n3.  Trigger  3.  Streamlining  Decentralization.  Within  7  years,  Indonesia  has  become \nhighly decentralized, in comparison with the pre-crisis regime. There is full political autonomy, in \nthat  the  heads  of  districts  are  directly  elected  by  the  citizens.  Local  assemblies  approve \nbudgets. In 2004, the regions commanded about 35% of total government spending. Given the \nsharp increase in regional transfers in 2006, the regional share in total public investment is likely \nto rise above 50% in 2006. The regions also employ about three quarters of the 4.2 million civil \nservants.  Yet,  the  decentralization  agenda  is  far  from  complete,  as  there  are  numerous \nconstraints pertaining to clarity of functional responsibilities, funding allocations not being in line \nfunctions,  lopsided  control  exerted  by  the  national  Government  without  any  corresponding \naccountability,  wide-ranging  legal  inconsistencies  between  the  framework  laws  on \ndecentralization and sectoral laws, unrealistic pursuit of minimum service standards without \nregard  for  fiscal  position,  severe  capacity  constraints,  and  most  importantly,  significant \nweaknesses  in  public  service  delivery.  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  Local  Government  Finance  and \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \nGovernance Reform Sector Development Program (SDP)1 and the proposed Poverty Reduction \nand Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Acceleration Program support the Government in \naddressing these constraints over the medium term. \n \n4.  The first and second phases of the DPL helped the adoption of some key regulations \nrelating to decentralization. DPSP-2 aims to address two key binding constraints. First, the \ncontinuing lack of clarity in the regulatory framework for national to local government onlending \nand on-granting arrangements. Second, the need to move towards a market-oriented system of \nsubnational  credit.  Both  are  particularly  important  for  local  and  provincial  government \ninvestments  for  infrastructure.  Borrowing  for  infrastructure  and  other  projects  is  severely \nunderutilized. By 2004, provincial, district, and municipal water enterprise (PDAM) outstanding \ndebt was just 0.18% of GDP. The Government needs to finalize draft revisions to onlending and \non-granting decrees to facilitate immediate support for local infrastructure finance and service \ndelivery. After that, the Government should begin to establish a regulatory framework for the \ndevelopment of more market-based system of subnational credit, including the issuance of \nregional bonds (based on Law on Regional Fiscal Balance No. 33/2004). \n \n5.  Trigger 4. Clarify the Legal Status of Regional Government-owned Enterprises \n(BUMDs). The private sector has historically played a major role in Indonesia\u2019s economy, \ngenerating approximately 60\u201370% of GDP in the pre-crisis years.2 With the onset of the financial \ncrisis and the Government\u2019s assumption of much of the country\u2019s productive assets as part of \nthe wholesale restructuring of the banking sector, the share of the private sector is estimated to \nhave dropped to 30% of GDP in 2000. Subsequent rounds of privatization from 2001 to 2004 \nhave transferred an estimated $39 trillion in assets to the private sector, allowing it to return to \nits pre-crisis GDP contribution. Despite the strong presence of the private sector in the macro-\neconomy, Indonesia\u2019s public sector is one of the largest in the region with over 150 state-owned \nenterprises  (SOEs),  some  of  which  dominate  key  sectors  of  the  economy\u2014most  notably \nbanking, ports, airports, energy, and oil and gas. As of December 2004, the publicly listed SOEs \nin which the government had a controlling interest represented 32.5% of total stock market \ncapitalization. At the subnational level, many other BUMDs exist, including the 26 regional \ndevelopment banks, water distribution boards, and a reportedly large number of new SOEs \ncreated  by  district  and  regional  governments  to  capture  some  of  the  economic  product \ngenerated by their constituencies. The exact number of these SOEs is not known but it is \nestimated to be close to 1,000. Typical activities are those involved in local trade where the \nSOE is given an exclusive license to provide a new obligatory service to transacting parties. \nAlthough  Indonesia  has  promoted  competition  in  some  sectors  in  recent  years  and  has \ndecreased  the  privileges  awarded  to  SOEs,  political  opposition  has  effectively  hindered \nattempts to privatize SOEs. Some subnational governments have improved management and \ntransparency of subnational BUMDs to stem losses and prepare them for privatization. Given \nthe general lack of a level playing field, it is important that the role of SOEs is clarified and \nefforts are made to achieve privatization on a gradual basis. \n \n6.  Trigger 5. Enactment of Warehouse Receipts Law. Several surveys (see Figure 3 in \nthe main text of this report) have repeatedly shown that small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs) face significant constraints in accessing formal sources of finance to meet their working \ncapital needs as well as investment needs for business expansion. A recent ADB technical \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Sector Development Program. \nManila (October). \n2   ADB. 2006. Indonesia: Private Sector Assessment. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 2      39      \nassistance  (TA)  study  advised  the  Government  that  a  systematic  approach  is  needed  to \nalleviate regulatory and finance constraints facing SMEs in Indonesia.3 Given the collateralized \nlending,  SMEs  often  have  difficulty  obtaining  competitive  loans  from  banks.  In  particular, \nmovable property may not be used as collateral, as Bank Indonesia\u2019s loan loss reserve rules \nprevent the use of such assets. As a result, it has been very hard to expand business for many \nof Indonesia\u2019s SMEs, which are often considered the main drivers behind economic growth. The \nADB TA noted that institutionalizing a warehouse receipts system could support some SMEs, \nparticularly those engaged in the agribusiness and trading sectors. \n \n7.  Trigger  6.  Continue  Implementation  of  the  Financial  Sector  Safety  Net.  In  the \naftermath of the financial crisis in 1997, the Government introduced a blanket guarantee of all \nbank  liabilities  to  restore  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  and  control  bank  runs. \nSubsequently,  as  crisis  resolution  progressed  and  the  banking  sector  strengthened,  the \nGovernment  committed  itself  to  lifting  the  blanket  guarantee  in  a  phased  manner  and \nintroducing a deposit insurance scheme that would cover deposits of up to Rp100 million. \nParliament approved the Law on Deposit Insurance in August 2004, setting out a phased plan to \nreduce the coverage of the blanket guarantee to become effective from September 2005, \naccording to the schedule in Table A2. \n \n8.  The  main  objectives  of  the  deposit  insurance  scheme  are  to  reduce  the  economic \ndistortions and moral hazard created by the blanket guarantee as well as potentially to try to \nlimit the fiscal costs to the Government in the event of future difficulties in the banking sector. It \nis also an integral part of the overall financial sector safety net being put in place by the \nGovernment. Some of the other elements include Bank Indonesia\u2019s role as a lender of last \nresort and establishment of institutional processes and mechanisms by which banks facing \ndifficulties would be either aided by Bank Indonesia or otherwise resolved. \nTable A2: Implementation Schedule for the Deposit Insurance Scheme \nImplementation Phases  Current Status/Milestone \n22 September 2005\u201321 March 2006  The entire amount of deposit was protected \n22 March 2006\u201321 September 2006  Maximum Rp5 billion is protected \n22 September 2006\u201321 March 2007  Maximum Rp1 billion will be protected \nStarting from 22 March 2007  Maximum Rp100 million will be protected \nSource:  Law on Deposit Insurance, Government of Indonesia. \n \n9.  Trigger 7. Complete the Reorganization of the Consolidated Nonbank Financial \nInstitutions (NBFIs) Supervisory Agency. Until 2002, the structural reforms to deal with crisis-\nrelated problems almost squarely focused on the banking sector. Recognizing the need for \nfinancial sector diversification, given the dominance of banks which account for over 80% \nfinancial system assets, the Government adopted wide-ranging reforms to strengthen NBFIs. \nThe thrust of the agenda, supported by ADB through the Financial Governance and Social \nSecurity Reform Program and related TAs, has been to harmonize and improve the regulatory \nframework  of  NBFIs  to  encourage  them  to  diversify  and  create  more  long-term  financing \nmodalities. In the initial stages, FGSSR\u2014in line with the Government\u2019s plans\u2014focused on \nestablishing  an  integrated  financial  sector  regulator  (OJK).  Subsequent  to  the  2003 \namendments to Bank Indonesia Law, which stipulated that a fully integrated OJK (one that \ncombined the supervision of both banks and NBFIs) shall be pursued from 2010, the focus of \nthe Government and ADB has been on establishing a strong NBFI regulator.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Final report for TA 4281-INO (ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for the Provincial SME \nDevelopment. Manila).  \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \n10.  In line with the above approach, the minister of finance endorsed an action plan in \nDecember 2004 as part of the FGSSR, to strengthen the NBFI sector and merge the Capital \nMarket Supervisory Agency (BAPEPAM, as the regulator of capital markets) and the Directorate \nGeneral of Financial Institutions (DGFI) in MOF (regulator of pension, insurance and other \nNBFIs). In 2005, a presidential decree merging BAPEPAM and DGFI was adopted. Therefore, \nthere are now two financial sector regulators in Indonesia: Bank Indonesia and Bapepam-LK \n(the combined capital markets and NBFI regulator). \n \n11.  Trigger 8. Improve Investment Climate. As part of DPL-2/DPSP, the Government \nsubmitted a draft of the new Investment Law to Parliament. Subsequently, the Government has \ntaken a range of steps. The implementing regulations for the investment law are designed to \nimprove the investment climate by cutting the time required to start a business; by replacing the \ncurrent uncertain and costly investment approval system with a simpler registration system; and \nby streamlining business licensing by encouraging local one-stop shops. A transparent negative \nlist will reduce the uncertainty faced by foreign investors when considering investments in \nIndonesia and will reduce the need for official discretion (a potential source of corruption). The \nnational team for exports and investment (PEPI) is proposed to have an ombudsman function to \nhelp investors. Another issue raised by the business community and the public relates to \npayments on disputed amounts of tax assessments. While international practice varies on \nwhether tax assessments should be payable pending appeals, a strong argument can be made \nin  Indonesia  for  deferring  the  payment  of  a  tax  assessment  and  suspending  collection \nenforcement while a case is under objection with the Directorate General of Taxation and \nappealed to the Tax Tribunal. Such a change would be extraordinarily significant. By markedly \nshifting the balance of power between the tax administration and taxpayers, the deferral of \npayment would make it much more difficult for tax officials to extract bribes and, consequently, \nprovide taxpayers with a greater sense of confidence in the integrity of the tax system. \n \n12.  Trigger 9. Issue Implementing Regulations for State Treasury and Audit Laws. The \nState Treasury Law (Law No. 1/2004) has set the foundation for modern budget execution and \nreporting.  Following  the  law,  the  Government  has  taken  steps  to  rationalize  the  current \nproliferation of government bank accounts, centralize cash management, simplify and speed up \nthe  payments  system,  and  improve  reporting  on  budget  execution.  Government  financial \nreporting  is  also  being  improved  through  the  implementation  of  government  accounting \nstandards on a modified accrual basis, with an eventual move planned to full accrual accounting \nwhich will be a highly complex undertaking at national and local government levels. The State \nAudit Law (Law No. 15/2004) lays out the broad legal framework for the operation of the \ncountry\u2019s supreme audit institution (BPK) to reinforce its position and mandate as an external \naudit institution reporting to parliament. Both laws require detailed regulations to guide their \nimplementation. While considerable work has already been done to develop regulations for the \nState Finance Law of 2003, the Government has fallen behind in the case of the treasury and \naudit laws, which require more concerted efforts. \n \n13.  Trigger 10. Continue Implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA). DPL-2 \nsupported  the  establishment  of  the  TSA  on  a  pilot  basis.  Effective  management  of  state \nfinances requires minimizing central government idle cash/cash float, reducing maintenance \ncost of too many accounts, facilitating cash forecasting and cash management control, as well \nas enhancing transparency of central government banking. When the TSA is fully implemented, \nthe regional treasury offices (KPPNs) will no longer access Bank Indonesia. All government \naccounts in the country will be centrally financed by the Directorate General (DG) of Treasury, \nwhich will enhance internal controls. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2      41      \n14.  Trigger 11. Improve Budgetary Reporting. The 2001 Country Financial Accountability \nAssessment (CFAA) identified the need to improve macro-level budget reporting, both in its \ncontent and its timing. All budget reporting should be made based on the Government Financial \nStatistics classification, which would allow reporting of recurrent and capital expenditures as \nwell as financing of the budget. Budget reporting should also be streamlined by eliminating \noverlapping  components  of  the  government  accounting  system.  This  would  allow  timely \nreporting of budget expenditures during and at the end of the year. On financial reporting, the \nGovernment prepared the first ever aggregated financial statement in 2004 and prepared a \nsimilar set for 2005 in a timely manner. This comprised a budget realization report, balance \nsheet, a cash flow statement and notes to accounts. An aggregated set of financial statements \nwas submitted to BPK at the end of March 2006 for audit of 2005 finances. This aggregation \nprocess  is  quite  complex,  involving  aggregation  of  accounts  across  hundreds  of  reporting \nentities. The statements for fiscal year 2005 are also the first ones to be issued after the formal \nadoption  of  the  new  Government  Accounting  Standards  promulgated  in  June  2005.  The \naggregated financial statements for 2005 were prepared based on modified accrual accounting \nstandards. However, considering practical issues such as capacity constraints of accounting \nstaff in line ministries, the Government has not yet been able to ensure consistent adoption of \nall the accounting and reporting principles laid down by the Government Regulation, and it \nintends to implement the Government Accounting Standards in stages. While much still needs \nto be done to enhance the reliability of the financial statements, it can be done only on a gradual \nbasis over the medium to long term given the pervasive capacity constraints. Nevertheless, \nsome improvements have been made in enhancing the comprehensiveness of these statements \nfrom the previous year; and the efforts being made by MOF to meet international standards with \nrespect to timeliness, reliability, and disclosure need to be acknowledged. \n \n15.  Trigger 12. Operationalize the National Procurement Policy Office (NPPO). The \nissuance of Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 promotes the basic principles of procurement: \ntransparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and  efficiency.  It  covers  all  areas  of \nprocurement that use public funds and contracting entities at all levels of government. The \ndecree meets most of what is generally regarded as accepted international practice. However, \nthe pace of Indonesia\u2019s commendable decentralization reforms has had an impact on public \nsector procurement, as different levels of government\u2014from ministers, governors, and even \nmayors\u2014are able to issue their own decrees, regulations, and instructions. The regulations\u2014 \nthemselves excessive in number\u2014are often inconsistent, and many do not meet accepted \ninternational practice. Consequently, national procurement reforms and the need for national \nprocurement policies and standards have become urgent. One key step in this direction is the \ncreation of an NPPO, which the Government had committed to undertaking in 2001. However, \nprogress has lagged in making the NPPO fully operational. \n \n16.  Trigger  13.  Modernize  Tax  Administration  to  Improve  Governance.  Poor \ngovernance in tax administration has been a major weakness impeding investment climate in \nIndonesia. The Directorate General of Tax has been receiving assistance from donors on a \nrange of areas.4 Yet, implementation of reforms has until recently been slow. The pace of reform \nhas now accelerated, and under the newly appointed Director General and a revitalized reform \nteam, the Tax Department is proposing wide-reaching changes to the Tax Department\u2019s head \noffice (an area that had not been previously part of the reforms). Under this program, tax \n                                                 \n4  At  the  core  is  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  modernization  strategy  that  comprises,  among  others: \n(i) consolidating and upgrading service center functions; (ii) segmenting taxpayers into categories for appropriate \nmonitoring and servicing; (iii) simplifying tax compliance procedures; and (iv) improving governance, including \ninstituting a code of conduct, a special investigations unit, improvements to the Tax Court, and adoption of a code \nof taxpayers rights. \n ", "42  Appendix 2 \nadministration  will  be  fully  reengineered  to  incorporate  2\u20133  large  taxpayer  offices,                  \n12\u201315 medium taxpayer offices, and countrywide accessible small taxpayer offices through \nwhich the modernized system would function. \n \n17.  Triggers 14 and 15. Promoting Governance in Public Administration. Recently, the \nGovernment has begun to undertake a series of initiatives that constitute one of the most \npromising openings for civil service reform in years. A key first step has been the effort to design \na new job classification and remuneration policy for high-ranking state officials [pejabat Negara \n(ministers, legislators, judges, and heads of special commissions and agencies)]. MOF has \ntaken leadership and set up a task force to examine the entire compensation package with the \ngoal of creating a more transparent, systematic, and coherent framework of pay and allowances \nbased on a comprehensive job evaluation and pay grading. The task force has proposed to \nestablish an independent Remuneration Commission to recommend to the President both the \nlevel and structure of the compensation package\u2014first for Indonesia's highest ranking political \nofficials and, once firmly established, for the entire civil service. The commission will also be \ntasked  with  establishing  greater  consistency  and  transparency  of  the  overall  remuneration \npackage to improve governance. The commission\u2019s recommendations will be based on modern \ntechniques, such as job evaluations and pay comparator surveys. In addition, promising civil \nservice reform pilots are being developed in MOF, Ministry of Trade, and Ministry of National \nEducation (which covers 2.7 million teachers out of the total pool of 4.5 million civil servants). \n \n ", "Appendix 3  43  \nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER, POLICY MATRIX,  \nAND FORWARD-LOOKING PROGRAM  \n \n \n \nLetter of Development Policy \n \n \nS-207/M.EKON/11/2006 \nS-484/MK.011/2006 \nJakarta, Indonesia, November 16, 2006 \n \nMr. Paul Wolfowitz \nPresident \nThe World Bank \nWashington, DC, USA \n \nMr. Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank \nManila, Philippines \n \n \nDear Mr. Wolfowitz, Mr. Kuroda: \n \nOn behalf of the Indonesian Government we would like to review the progress during our second \nyear in office, highlight the reform agenda for the year ahead, and request your continued \nassistance through another Development Policy Loan. \n \nThis has been a transformative year for Indonesia. The difficult adjustment to last year\u2019s higher \nfuel prices and interest rates is ending with improved macroeconomic stability and accelerating \ngrowth. These policy steps were needed to return confidence and put fiscal-monetary policy on a \nsounder footing, thus providing the basis for sustained GDP growth and poverty alleviation over \nthe long term. Along with the economic adjustment, the past year has seen more natural disasters, \nheightened concerns over avian influenza, and continued vulnerability among a large segment of \nIndonesia\u2019s people. Despite these challenges, the Government has pushed through its reform \nprogram with stepped up efforts in priority areas, including the investment climate, the financial \nsector; infrastructure; governance, anti-corruption, and civil service; and service delivery, social \nprotection, and social inclusion through community-driven approaches.   \n \nThe Government\u2019s Strategy \nNew initiatives and policy packages in the areas mentioned above aim to complement our broad-\nbased medium-term development plan (or RPJM) \u2013 which seeks to reduce poverty in half, to 8.2 \npercent during the 2004-09 period \u2013 and the Annual Action Plans (RKP), particularly for 2007. \nThese documents will form the basis of the Government\u2019s strategy and commitments. Note in \nparticular these priorities in the 2007 (RKP) include the following nine areas: (1)alleviation of \npoverty  and  disparity;  (2)  enhancement  of  job  opportunities,  investment  and  exports;  (3) \nrevitalization of agriculture and rural investment; (4) enhancement of accessibility and quality of \n ", "44  Appendix 3 \neducation  and  health;  (5)  law  enforcement,  human  rights,  eradication  of  corruption,  and \nbureaucratic  reforms;  (6)  strengthening  defense  capacity,  security  and  order,  and  conflict \nresolution; (7) mitigating and managing natural disasters; (8) infrastructure development and (9) \ndevelopment of isolated/border regions. Our efforts to achieve these short- to medium-term \nobjectives  will  succeed,  in  part,  through  continued  support  and  collaboration  from  our \ndevelopment partners, with development policy or program lending representing an important and \nintegral part of this partnership.   \n \nDevelopment Policy Assistance \nThis is the third Development Policy Loan and we are pleased with the partnership created \nbetween the government and the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the \nJapanese government. We appreciate your support for, and assistance to, the government\u2019s reform \nagenda  in  the  areas  of  (1)  macroeconomic  stability;  (2)  the  investment  climate;  (3)  public \nfinancial  management  and  governance;  and  (4)  public  service  delivery.  We  appreciate  the \nincreased efficiency and focus that the donors provide as a harmonized group. Perhaps even \nmore, we appreciate your commitment to providing reliable development financing in support of \nprogress on a mutually agreed upon reform agenda. The policy agenda agreed to for DPL 3 has \nbeen proceeding well and we have, or will shortly, meet virtually all the policy actions committed \nto. Our gross financing needs remain large in 2006 and this letter is in support of a request for the \nWorld Bank to approve a program loan of US$600 million and for the Asian Development Bank \nto approve a program loan of US$200 million to disburse in FY2006. \n \nMaintaining Macroeconomic Stability \nIn the area of macroeconomic stability, Indonesia has had good success over recent years. The \neconomy appears to have successfully weathered the October 2005 fuel price increase, the \ncurrency volatility that preceded it, and the economic slowdown that followed. GDP growth has \nrebounded in the second-half of 2006. Falling from a strong 6 percent in early-2005 to 5.5-5.7 for \nthe year, growth bottomed out to 4.7 percent in the first quarter of 2006 before climbing to 5.2 \npercent in the second quarter. We now project growth to exceed 6 percent by the fourth quarter of \n2006. Improved economic indicators have helped bolster consumer and market confidence, as \nwell as improved market credit ratings. Indonesia\u2019s credit ratings continue to improve, with \nMoody\u2019s moving from B2 to B1 in May and S&P from B+ to BB- in July. The stock market \nreached historic highs and now stands over 30 percent above its level in January this year. Lastly, \ncapital imports, which were weak during the first half of 2006, reached their highest in nine years \nin  August  and  September  2006.  These  indicators,  coupled  with  increased  Government  and \nconsumer  spending,  and  strong  exports,  are  driving  current  economic  growth.  Investments, \nhowever, have shown some decline. With improved macroeconomic fundamentals, we are laying \na stronger foundation for sustained growth over the long term.   \n \nThe  Government  and  monetary  authority  has  been  very  successful  in  controlling  inflation. \nInterest rates are now declining at all maturities and are approaching historical lows at the long \nend of the curve. Year-on-year inflation has fallen from over 17 percent by the end of 2005 to 6.3 \npercent in October 2006, and we expect inflation will end the year well below the low end of the \nCentral Bank\u2019s inflation target range of 7 to 9 percent, setting the stage for further reductions next \nyear. The Government will continue to work with the Central Bank on the medium-term goal of \nbringing inflation in line with that of neighboring countries, as we believe that this will add \nadditional stability to our exchange rate and reduce the current premium built into Indonesia\u2019s \nreal interest rate, which will further spur investment.   \n \n ", "Appendix 3  45  \nWe aim to continue allowing the exchange rate to float and to reduce debt vulnerability as \nmeasured by the debt to GDP ratio. The exchange rate has strengthened and stabilized in the \n9,100 range, providing increased predictability. We have managed to add to our foreign exchange \nreserves despite pre-paying close to US$ 8 billion to the IMF. Our total reserves now stand at \nalmost US$45 billion, up from around US$35 billion in October 2005.   \n \nWhile we do not anticipate immediate large fuel price increases, we do intend to address the \nproblem of large untargeted subsides while we improve institutional and policy issues related to \ndebt  management,  improved  macro  and  fiscal  policy  making,  and  intergovernmental  fiscal \nrelations (including the sub-national borrowing framework). Remaining costly untargeted fuel \nand electricity subsidies should fall as the State Owned Electric Company (PLN) increases its use \nof gas and coal and new entrants, including international oil companies, expand their market \nshare in fuel products at market prices. International oil prices remain volatile and difficult to \npredict but the government remains committed to the longer-term goal of energy prices at \neconomic or market rates to promote efficiency and safeguard our fiscal position.  \n \nGross borrowing needs will remain large in 2006 due to the maturity structure of foreign and \ndomestic debt obligations. Nevertheless, in terms of spending, our budget situation has improved \nsubstantially. For perhaps the first time since the crisis, we can begin to address long-neglected \npublic service delivery and infrastructure needs. At current international oil prices, we have \nincreased the amount of central government capital spending (from 1.2 percent of GDP in 2005 to \nover 2 percent in 2006 and 2007) and resource transfers to regional governments (from 5.3 \npercent in 2005 to over 7 percent of GDP in 2006 and 2007). A priority for this additional \nspending is an expanded community-based poverty program and we anticipate that the central \nand  regional  governments  will  increase  infrastructure  spending  as  well.  Fortunately  the \ngovernment is able to increase these spending levels while maintaining deficits in the 1 percent of \nGDP range and we expect that the debt to GDP ratio will be below 40 percent by the end of 2006.    \n \nTo help achieve deficit and debt targets, we have pushed to substantially improve the institutional \nframework for improved debt, fiscal, and sub-national policy at the Ministry of Finance. We have \nonce again reorganized the Ministry to better focus on these missions, including the development \nof required structures and transition strategies as well as appointing officials to head Debt \nManagement,  Fiscal  Policy,  Asset  Management  and  Inter-Regional  Fiscal  Affairs  units \n(Presidential Decree 66/June 2006). We would note that these are areas we indicated would be a \nfocus (under Macroeconomic Stability) in last year\u2019s Letter of Development Policy.  \n \nThe Debt Management Office integrates domestic and external debt, organized along functional \nlines,  i.e.,  a  front,  middle,  and  back  offices.  Work  has  to  deepen  the  2005  formal  debt \nmanagement strategy. Practically speaking this has seen the continued monthly debt auctions, the \nintroduction of retail bonds, the lengthening of the yield cure, buybacks and debt switching for \nbonds coming due in the next few years to smooth the profile, and reduce the share foreign debt. \nHowever, we have also continued to improve integrated debt reporting risk management. For \nexample, beginning with DPL 2, we adopted a Fixed Spread Loan (FSL) for the first time, \nallowing  us  to  better  hedge  currency  risk.  We  have  begun  work  to  undertake  a  detailed \nassessment of civil service pension liabilities and other contingent and implicit liabilities but this \narea will be a priority reform in 2007. \n \nOn fiscal policy, we have established a Fiscal Policy Office, led by an appointed head, which \nshould be fully operational in 2007 as envisioned (with support programmed under the Bank \nGFMRAP program). It is designed to provide better quality and coordination on macro and fiscal \npolicy issues and it will have units responsible for macroeconomic, revenue (taxes and customs), \n ", "46  Appendix 3 \nexpenditure policies, and risk management. While the FPO is not yet in place it already has \naccess to improved data, especially from the tax department. Improved sectoral data give us the \nability to more quickly and accurately assess the state of the economy. This will shortly be \nextended to allow regional assessments by sector and to improve macro and tax forecasting. \nHowever, the primary focus of the embryonic Fiscal Policy Office this year has been on the \ndevelopment of a Risk Management Unit (RMU) to assess government support, contingent and \nimplicit liabilities, most immediately (and with outside support) on infrastructure projects. We \nhave continued to make progress on the institutional design and capabilities of Team Tariff, \nincluding the appointment of a vice-chairman from the Ministry of Trade. Nevertheless, this \nagenda  has  suffered  from  the  focus  on  institutional  set-up,  and  the  urgency  of  the  Risk \nManagement Units\u2019 infrastructure mandate and efforts to improve the functioning of the team \nwill have to remain a priority in 2007. \n \nThe framework for sub-national borrowing has continued to make progress, and again we expect \nthat  policy  coordination  will  accelerate  under  the  new  structure  with  a  Director  General \nresponsible  for  oversight  of  the  critical  issues  in  this  area,  including  among  other  things, \nfunctional assignments, fiscal transfers, and local government revenues. In particular we had been \nconcerned about sub-national borrowing from capital markets (allowed under Law 33/2004) and \nhave been working to put in place a framework designed to simultaneously satisfy legitimate \nregional  government  needs  (for  example,  large  infrastructure  projects)  while  minimizing \nmacroeconomic risks. This involves both establishing a system for on-lending and on-granting of \ngovernment and donor funds, and a framework for sub-national bond issuance, including work-\nout procedures in the event of default.   \n \nOn-lending, on-granting, and procedures for projects to be financed/funded through on-lending or \non-granting are now essentially in place (i.e. through the Blue Book at Bappenas) and completed \n(PMK Nos 52 and 53/2006 and PerMen PPN No. 5/2006). The Ministerial Decree on the issuance \nof regional bonds is almost complete while the framework for work-out procedures for Local \nWater Utilities (PDAMs) have been revised and finalized (PP 14/05 and PMK no 107/2005) and \nwe  are  now  beginning  work  on  the  Ministerial  decree  on  work  out  procedures  for  local \ngovernments (Pemda), required for local State Owned Enterprises such as Water Utilities to \nborrow.  We  would  also  note  that  the  Law  on  Local  Government  State-Owned  Enterprises \ndesigned to clarify the status of these companies with respect to their regional governments will \nbe submitted to Parliament the end of this year. The imminent completion of this framework \nshould allow regional governments to begin to access additional donor and market finance, and \naddress Millennium Development Goals, especially water, which is a priority service delivery \ngoal for 2007. \n \nMoving forward, after discussions with your staff, we propose to transition away from including \nspecific macroeconomic policy measures in the reform package supported by the development \npolicy program. This does not in any way reflect a reduced emphasis on macroeconomic stability, \nwhich will remain a centerpiece of the government\u2019s strategy. Rather, the key macroeconomic \nitems that had fallen under the \u201cmacroeconomic pillar,\u201d e.g., fiscal policy institutions, will be \naddressed in the investment, public financial management, and public service pillars. This would \nprovide greater focus in the overall program. \n \nInvestment Climate \nWhile restoring macroeconomic stability is a prerequisite for economic growth, sustaining high \ngrowth  rates  in  the  longer  term  requires  increased  private  investment  and  a  substantial \n ", "Appendix 3  47  \nimprovement in infrastructure. These are areas that suffered from neglect in the past and are the \nfocus of three reform packages and other initiatives. The reform packages address infrastructure, \ninvestment (including the regulatory framework, taxes, customs and labor), and the financial \nsector, with a package on small and medium enterprises (SME) financing under development. \nEach package lays out goals, specific actions, timelines and responsibilities. Reforms in these \nareas are progressing well and we expect to see tangible results for investors. \n \nImproving infrastructure is among our highest priorities. Under the third Development Policy \nLoan we have focused on support for the development of public private partnerships, a risk \nmanagement unit (with an infrastructure focus) and the budgetary commitment of resources to \ncontingent liabilities. These areas progressed well including through the issuance of Perpres \n67/2005  and  PMK  38/2006  and  the  setting  up,  the  operationalization  of  the  RMU  and  a \ndirectorate of Investment to provide government support for private infrastructure. However, \nwhile we continue to prioritize the provision of infrastructure as an investment climate issue and \nan important item in its own right, rather than detail our strategy and commitment here, in \nagreement with your team, we leave this area to other documents and forums.  \n \n As we indicated, the new investment law is under discussion in Parliament and while we can not \ndetermine the exact timing of its passage we believe that Parliament understands the importance \nof this legislation as a signal to investors. We are simultaneously preparing critical implementing \ndecrees for the law, including an improved negative list, a shift from approval to registration, \nestablishing local one-stop investment centers, and providing fiscal incentives. These decrees are \nnearing completion and will be ready when the investment law is passed. We were pleased that \nbusiness start-up time as measured in the World Bank\u2019s most recent Doing Business report fell \nfrom 151 to 97 days this year. Passage of the new investment law and its accompanying decrees \nwill further strengthen this trend. However, an ambitious program to streamline and simplify \nbusiness licensing, together with measures to eliminate unnecessary steps in the establishment of \nlimited companies, will be needed to reach our goal of cutting start-up time to just 30 days. \n \nProgress has been achieved in implementing the investment climate reform package that was \nannounced in early March 2006. A new team has been established to review regional regulations \nharmful to business activity and has recommended cancellation of 130 such regulations, 85 of \nwhich have already been cancelled. A decree mandating the establishment of one-stop investment \ncenters by local governments has been issued, and drawing on the experience of advanced \nlocalities it is expected that these \u201cone-stop shops\u201d will greatly accelerate business licensing. \nProcedures for approving the employment of expatriate manpower have been simplified. The \nnumber of companies granted fast track \u201cgold card\u201d customs clearance status has been increased \nfrom 71 to 91 with an additional 15 companies under review. Risk assessments have been carried \nout for 517 importers as part of a planned shift from broad based physical inspection of imports to \nmore narrowly targeted inspections. And a decree on fiscal incentives has been approved at the \nministerial level and sent to the Ministry of Justice for finalization. Nevertheless there has been \nsome  slippage  from  the  time  targets  established  in  the  investment  climate  policy  package, \nparticularly with respect to labor regulations, revision of the draft tax laws, simplification of \nbusiness licensing and the use of the red lane at customs. \n \nLast year\u2019s commitment to a new trade law was premature. Rather than push ahead with an \nomnibus law on domestic and foreign trade we focused on the passage of a law on Warehouse \nReceipts that will provide additional collateral especially important to small businesses. Next \nyear\u2019s trade priorities include several things. First, we need to come back to the overall setting of \ntrade policy as the pace of negotiations on bilateral and regional trade agreements is very rapid \nand increasingly includes service sectors and an increased focus on non-tariff barriers. Indonesia \n ", "48  Appendix 3 \nwill  need  improved  coordination  across  these  areas  if  we  are  to  make  the  best  of  arising \nopportunities. We need a roadmap on trade policy making and coordination to do this. However, \nin the short-term we also need to push ahead with the modernization and upgrading of Tariff \nsetting which will inevitably be a key component of any trade policy system and an area of \npriority this year. Another trade priority is the creation of a National Single Window (which will \ninclude an electronic Single Administrative Document and paperless clearance) in line with our \ncommitment to our partners in ASEAN. \n \nThe proposed revisions to the tax laws designed to improve the balance between tax payers and \ntax  officials  represents  perhaps  the  key  investment  climate  reform  developed  in  2006. \nUnfortunately, for procedural reasons, we were not able to submit revisions to the draft tax law \nalready in Parliament, but we have agreed with key political parties to have them submit these \nkey revisions as their own. We will, of course, make a strong case for including these revisions, \nand both domestic and foreign chambers of commerce will be pushing for the changes. There are \nnumerous revisions to these laws, including, for example, the establishment of a single corporate \ntax rate and a phased reduction in the top rate from 30 to 25 percent. One of the most important \nchanges will allow taxpayers to pay their own assessment of taxes owed, in line with the self-\nassessment principle, rather than the tax official\u2019s assessment as is currently the case. If the \ntaxpayer underestimates their liability they will be responsible for interest and penalties but this \nrevision  should  provide  significantly  better  balance  between  taxpayers  and  officials.  These \nrevisions to the tax laws are complex and while we would like them to be completed by the end \nof 2006, in order to take effect in 2007, the precise timing of Parliamentary action cannot be \npredicted with certainty. Thus we propose to continue to improve service to taxpayers as part of \nthe expansion of modern tax offices to medium and smaller firms, to focus on improving services \nto taxpayers through a regulation(s) that provide clarity on the basis of the tax department\u2019s tax \ncalculation when it differs from the taxpayers and to focus on improving and simplifying VAT \nrefund procedures in line with recently passed DG tax regulation No.122/2006.    \n \nOne of the major disappointments in the last two years has been the slow growth in employment. \nDespite economic growth in the mid 5 percent range, unemployment has risen and formal sector \nemployment stagnated. The investment climate policy package proposed that there should be \nrevisions to the Labor law to address constraints to increased hiring. Based on the report by the \nUniversity Consortium we no longer intend to address these issues through a revised labor law \nbut we will find other approaches designed to address critical issues, including the high costs of \nseverance (and inequity of severance pay under conditions of dismissal for cause), the lack of \nclarity on outsourcing and on the consequences of illegal strikes. \n \nIn line with economic recovery we need improved performance from the financial sector. In 2006 \nthis  agenda  advanced  with  the  continued  reduction  in  the  banking  sector  guarantee  (to \nRp. 1 billion in September), the formal reorganization of Bappepam and DGFI, the development \nof the financial sector package with a strong focus on Non-Bank Financial Institutions including \ninsurance, pensions and leasing and a Presidential decree on the establishment of an infrastructure \nfund that should be issued shortly. In 2007 we propose to continue to focus on improving the \nstability of the financial sector by operationalizing the Financial Stability Forum, finishing the \nwithdrawal of the blanket guarantee, implementing good corporate governance and improving \nrisk management standards in the banking system. To accelerate the development of the NBFIs \nwe propose to move ahead on: resolving weak insurance firms; assessing the extent of the \nGovernment\u2019s  pension  liabilities;  and  improving  the  ability  to  participate  in  infrastructure \nfinance. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  49  \nFinally, we would like to increase the emphasis on the development of small and medium \nenterprises by developing and implementing a SME financing package that includes such things \nas access to credit (through improvements in credit reporting) and the implementation of the \nWarehouse Receipts Law. \n \nFiduciary and governance reforms \nThis year we propose to continue our focus on public financial management reforms but in line \nwith the adjustments in DPL 3, we are broadening the agenda to include anti-corruption and civil \nservice  measures  designed  to  complement  the  emphasis  on  improved  budgeting,  financial \nmanagement and procurement. We particularly intend to work closely with Bank Indonesia, the \nMinistry of Finance, the Executive Audit Agency (BPKP), and internal audit agencies of the \nGovernment  and  the  Supreme  Audit  Board  (BPK),  and  to  complete  the  few  outstanding \ngovernment regulations for the State Treasury and Audit Laws. Now that much of the regulatory \nframework is falling into place, our focus will move to implementation of the changes. \n \nIn 2006 the budget was prepared far earlier in the year and Ministries and Agencies are now \nbetter acquainted with the revised systems. Budget disbursement improved in 2006 relative to \n2005, but back loading of expenditures and procurement continues to be a problem. We are now \ncommitted to reporting budget outcomes regularly and the first semester of 2006 is now available \non the Ministry of Finance website. We are also continuing to work to improve the quality of \nbudgets  and  budget  outcomes,  and  we  will  be  introducing  a  Medium  Term  Expenditure \nFramework (MTEF) and performance based budgeting in 2008. The new framework will present \nmulti-year macroeconomic and forward program estimates that should enhance planning and \nassessments and reduce the back-loading of spending. The Ministry of Finance and Planning \nMinistry are now working the revisions to budget and program structures required to deliver these \noutcomes in 2008.  \n \nIn addition, we propose to continue to improve treasury management by expanding the Treasury \nSingle Account (TSA) to both revenue and expenditure beyond the 50 treasury offices established \nin 2006. With the underlying Cash Management Regulation to be completed shortly, we would \nlike to extend the TSA to at least 50 percent of government cash operations, inventory and close \nunauthorized bank accounts, and develop regulations in consultation with Bank Indonesia to \nprevent the opening of other such accounts in the future. We also propose to address the long-\nterm accounting issues surrounding the subsidiary loan agreements in the Regional Development \nAccount (RDA) and Investment Funds Account (RDI), and bring them into compliance with \nGovernment accounting and compliance standards. \n \nImprovements to public procurement designed to improve processes and outcomes continue to be \na high priority. A National Public Procurement Office (NPPO) at Bappenas will be functioning at \nthe Echelon One level by next year when the Planning Ministry\u2019s reorganization is complete. We \nbelieve that the staffing and expertise implicit in an Echelon One level entity will be able to \naccelerate our procurement reform agenda. As we noted above, procurement has been a problem \nthis  year  as  the  bureaucracy  has  adjusted  to  new,  more  stringent  procedures.  Improved \nprocurement will increase resources available for government investment and public services \nthrough increased competition and reduced corruption. But this will require the expansion of on-\ngoing  training  and  certification  of  procurement  officials,  as  well  as  the  extension  of  e-\nprocurement  and  the  use  of  standard  bidding  documents.  With  the  NPPO  in  place  and  e-\nprocurement efforts proceeding, we would like to move ahead with the development of a new \nprocurement law to strengthen the legal footing of Keppres 80/2003. \n \n ", "50  Appendix 3 \nThe BPK \u2013 Indonesia\u2019s Supreme Audit Board -- now has a stronger mandate to conduct external \naudit independently across government, and the new Audit Law (15/2004) strengthens the role of \nBPK and clarifies its role across all three levels of government. However, we acknowledge that \nthere is room to further clarify the mandates of the three internal audit institutions to remove \noverlaps and rationalize the allocation of resources between them, and between the internal and \nexternal audit institutions so that synergies between these institutions can be fully realized. \n \nLast year we discussed programs to reduce corruption and improve governance as well as to \nadvance civil service reform. We are pleased that reform momentum in these important areas has \nbeen such that we have moved them into the development policy framework this year. The fight \nagainst corruption remains one of our top priorities. The Anti-Corruption Commission continues \nto function well and existing agencies like the Supreme Audit Board, the Financial Transaction \nand Analysis Center, and the Attorney General\u2019s office are increasingly active, pursuing the \nprosecution of high profile graft cases. Our efforts to control corruption should be aided through \nimproved legal support for witnesses and whistle blowers under the Witness Protection Law \npassed earlier this year.  \n \nAs we noted earlier, civil service reform has become a critical priority. Sustained implementation \nof the kinds of reforms we have in mind and improved service delivery will require a civil service \nresponsive to incentives, especially performance and merit-based practices. Given the size and \ndiversity of the civil service, this agenda will clearly take time, but it is important that we get \nstarted. The creation of a remuneration commission for the highest level of the civil service  will \nrepresent a solid first step toward sorting out existing compensation practices and job descriptions \nwith the goal of a more systematic, transparent and coherent framework. This will have to be \nextended to the civil service as a whole, but we are not waiting for this to take place and a number \nof ministries are experimenting with institutional and compensation practices designed to create \nislands of excellence. We are pushing ahead with civil service pilots at the Ministry of Finance. \nFor example, at the Ministry of Finance we are creating an office to support the Minister\u2019s \noversight of ongoing reforms.   \n \nImproved Delivery of Public Service  \nA  focus  on  improved  public  service  delivery  was  introduced  last  year  in  response  to  the \nreallocation of public spending from fuel subsidies to pro-poor compensation programs and our \ncommitment  to  achieve  RPJM  and  MDG  goals  in  2009  and  2015,  respectively.  Given the \ncontinuing priority on improving public services, we propose to extend the policy commitments \nincluded in this area this year. The detailed assessments of the effectiveness of compensation \nprograms in education, health, rural infrastructure, and cash transfers have proven to be very \nuseful and we propose to institutionalize these assessments. \n \nThe key government program initiative in 2007 involves the scaling up of existing Community \nDriven Development programs to create a national program. However, these programs operate in \na different fashion than more typical Government programs with communities drawing down \nfunding tranches over time and employing either their own labor or contractors, depending on the \nchosen activity. These differences will need to be accommodated in the national program design \nand we are committed to allowing all CDD programs (not just donor-funded ones) to carry over \nunspent funds into the subsequent year and to employ simplified procurement more suitable for \nthe local level. These measures should ensure a smoother scale-up of these programs in 2007 and \nbeyond. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  51  \nIn addition, we remain committed to expanding access to clean water and local government \nservices that had previously been included under the macroeconomic stability pillar. As we noted \nwe have just about completed the framework for both on-lending and on-granting of Government \nand donor funds, with the framework for local government borrowing also nearing completion. In \n2006, we should see the beginning of the process of local governments and water utilities clearing \nup past arrears and accessing finance through these mechanisms. \n \nFinally, we would like to improve the Indonesian education system. This is an area where we \nhave  been  rapidly  increasing  our  spending  but  we  now  ned  to  ensure  that  quality  is  also \nimproved. To do this we propose focusing on upgrading teachers, the largest element of the civil \nservice, by establishing competency standards and monitoring teacher certification as developed \nby a National Standards Board. \n \nThe increase in fuel prices vastly strengthened our fiscal position in 2005 and 2006 while \nproviding us greater resources needed to improve services to the Indonesian people, especially the \npoor. As noted last year, we put in place programs designed to compensate the poor through \nsupport for education, health and rural infrastructure, and a programs would be sufficient to keep \npoverty from rising but the combination of the adjustment and a steep increase in domestic rice \nprices pushed up poverty by almost 2 percent. This is not an acceptable outcome and the \nGovernment is committed to pushing ahead more aggressively with our anti-poverty agenda. \nThus the President introduced the National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM) in his \nAugust 17th speech. The PNPM provides for a step-by-step expansion of donor supported anti-\npoverty program to all the villages and urban neighborhoods in Indonesia by 2009. We appreciate \nyour support for these programs and look forward to continuing to work with you on this very \nimportant initiative. In addition, we will be piloting conditional cash transfers that will provide \nincentives for poor households to lift themselves permanently out of poverty. \n \nConclusion \nOnce again we remain committed to a reform agenda focused on macroeconomic stability, the \ninvestment climate, improving public finances and governance, and improved public spending. \nThe areas raised have been highlighted in our RPJM, annual action plans for 2006 and 2007, and \nthe recent policy packages on infrastructure, investment and the financial sector. We anticipate \nthat successful reforms will deliver continued growth, employment, and poverty reduction, and \nwe look forward to working with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and Japanese \nGovernment to achieve our objectives in these areas. \n \n \n \n ", "   \n5\nTable A3.1: Policy Matrix for the Second Development Policy Support Program  2\n \n   \nDPSP-2 Policy Measures  Status as at Loan Negotiations (16 November 2006) \nA\nCore Policy Area I: Macroeconomic Stability and Creditworthiness  p\np\ne\n1.

Following the significant hike in \ninterest rates and fuel price increases in the fall of 2005, real GDP growth slowed to under 5 percent in \nthe last quarter of 2005 and first quarter of 2006 (y/y). However, growth picked up to 5.2 percent (y/y) in \nthe  second  quarter,  mainly  reflecting  strong  external  demand  and  some  acceleration  in  public \nconsumption. Though still weak, private consumption appears to be picking up, indicating that the \nadjustment to the domestic fuel price hike last fall is nearly complete. Nevertheless, unemployment is \nedging up and poverty rates remain high. Growth is expected to pick up gradually over the course of 2006 \nand in 2007, with IMF staff projecting annual growth to reach 5.2 percent and 6 percent, respectively, as \ninterest rates are reduced. Nevertheless, there are risks to this outlook, most importantly a weakening of \nthe international environment and slow implementation of structural reforms.  \nInflationary  pressures  have  been  declining.  Headline  inflation  declined  to  14.6  percent  (y/y)  in \nSeptember, from 17.1 percent at end-2005, reflecting weak activity and some appreciation of the rupiah. \nMeanwhile, three-month annualized inflation (both headline and core) has remained below 6 percent \nsince the beginning of the year. On current trends, Bank Indonesia\u2019s (BI\u2019s) end-year target of 7\u20139 percent \nfor headline inflation is well within reach.  \nThe overall banking sector continues to perform reasonably well. Partly due to reclassification, \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) increased substantially in 2005, especially at the two largest state banks, but \nthe rise in NPLs moderated in January\u2013June 2006. The sharp deceleration in credit growth in 2006, as a \nresult of high interest rates and weak demand, will to some extent undermine bank profitability, but the \nexpected reduction in interest rates should prevent excessive adverse effects on banks. Capital adequacy \nratios remain at over 20 percent. \nExternal vulnerabilities continue to be reduced. The current account is expected to remain in surplus in \n2006. Foreign exchange reserves, at about $39 billion after the repayment of remaining debt to the Fund \nof $3\u00bc billion on October 12, are equivalent to about 130 percent of short-term debt. The current account \nis expected to move into small deficit over the medium term as imports rise faster than exports, financed \nin large part by private sector capital inflows. The ratio of external debt to GDP is expected to be reduced \nto below 25 percent of GDP in 2011, from 48 percent of GDP in 2005. Nevertheless, the market volatility \nexperienced in May/June 2006 is a reminder that Indonesia remains susceptible to adverse developments \nin international capital markets. \n ", "60  ApAppepnednidx ix4  3 \nMacroeconomic and Structural Policies \nThe budgeted policy stance is broadly appropriate. The fiscal deficit targets of 1.3 percent of GDP for \n2006 and 0.9 percent of GDP for 2007, as outlined in the President\u2019s budget speech in mid-August, are \nappropriately geared to further reducing the debt burden, to below 30 percent in 2010 (compared with 47 \npercent at end 2005), while supporting activity in 2006. After considerable under spending in 2005 and \nthe first quarter of 2006, budget execution improved in the second quarter of 2006. \nMonetary policy continues to be geared to reducing inflation. BI\u2019s gradual approach to reducing its \npolicy rate has helped contain inflationary pressures and increase foreign exchange reserves. There should \nbe room for further gradual rate cuts given the benign inflation outlook and still large differential with \nU.S.  interest  rates,  though  the  authorities  need  to  be  careful  that  excessive  rate  decreases  do  not \nundermine their credibility and prospects for achieving the 2007 inflation target of 5\u20137 percent. The \nclarity and consistency of statements by BI officials in signaling the central bank\u2019s policy intentions, \nwithin the inflation targeting framework, has improved and is essential to maintaining credibility.  \nSteps are being taken to deal with NPLs at state banks. The recently signed Presidential decree \nallowing state banks to provide haircuts on loans, together with stepped-up efforts to enforce collections, \nshould help to resolve the NPL problem, and avoid erosion of bank capital. IMF staff continue to advise \nthat medium-term strategies be adopted for the state banks, which should involve privatizing those that do \nnot have a clear public policy objective. As regards private banks, supervisors will need to remain vigilant \nto enforce regulations, and to monitor any deterioration in credit quality.  \nThe government is proceeding on a broad range of fiscal reforms. Adoption of the tax package now \nbefore Parliament, along the lines endorsed by the business community, as well as modernization of the \ntax  department,  will  help  enhance  revenue  collection  while  restoring  investor  confidence.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  intention  to  better  manage  potential  risks  stemming  from  the  operations  of  public \nenterprises and private-public partnerships is welcome. \nTo improve the business climate and boost growth, the government has prepared an impressive \nreform agenda. Given the business community\u2019s concerns about implementation, some major early \nreform successes are needed to increase confidence that the entire package will be implemented. The \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to secure early approval of customs, investment, and tax laws are welcome, which \napart from the signaling effect would also bring immediate benefits for trade and investment. \nFund staff recognizes the difficulties of amending labor legislation. Staff supports the authorities\u2019 \nintention to press ahead with the introduction of regulations that ensure a balanced framework for labor-\nbusiness relations. The new regulations need to protect the rights of workers, while enhancing flexibility \nfor business, in particular with regard to severance pay and outsourcing requirements. More flexible labor \nmarkets  will  help  Indonesia  become  more  competitive  vis-\u00e0-vis  neighboring  countries  and  should \nencourage employers to make hiring decisions more freely. \nStatus of IMF Relations \n \n\u2022  Indonesia\u2019s Extended Arrangement with the Fund expired in December 2003. It was  followed by \na close policy dialogue with the authorities through post-program monitoring (PPM) (until the \nrecent repayment of all obligations to the Fund) and extensive technical assistance activities.  \n\u2022  The 2006 Article IV consultation and fifth PPM were completed on July 31. \n ", "  Appendix  4     61      \n\u2022  The next Fund mission is scheduled for early December, and technical assistance missions from \nthe Fiscal Affairs Department and the Monetary and Capital Markets Department will be in the \nfield during November. \n\u2022  The  Fund  welcomes  Indonesia's  early  repayment  of  its  obligations  to  the  Fund.  This  is  a \nreflection of the strength of the economy and especially, its balance of payments position. The \nFund expects to continue a constructive dialogue with the Indonesian authorities through regular \nstaff  visits,  technical  assistance  missions,  and  in  the  context  of  the  annual  Article  IV \nconsultations, the next of which is scheduled for mid-2007. \n ", "  6\n2\n \nA\nDEVELOPMENT PARTNERS COORDINATION MATRIX   p\np\n Core Policy Areas in  Components  ADB Support for Policy Reforms   Support from Other Development  end\nthe Development  Partners  ix 5\nPolicy Support   \nProgram  \nI.

Studies undertaken internally within the World Bank include a \nreview of the progress made in implementing the second DPL approved in year 2005 (in collaboration \nwith ADB and the Government of Japan), the results of a supervision mission to assess progress in \nimplementing the World Bank-financed Government Financial Management and Revenue Administration \nProject (GFMRAP) that became effective in October 2005, a review of the developments in the audit \nsector and the findings of a Public Expenditure Review completed this year. Other key inputs include the \nimplementation reports on the ongoing State Audit Reform Program and Project \u2013 being implemented \nwith ADB support - and a recent report by IMF on Observance of Standards and Codes on Fiscal \nTransparency. These provide the analytical underpinnings for PFM and fiduciary assessments for this \noperation. \nThe reform agenda is clearly being led by the Government, with support from several donor agencies, \nand has consistently received good support under the current Government that has been in office for two \nyears. Deficiencies in Indonesia\u2019s PFM systems have been well documented in recent years and a reform \nprogram to address these was formulated by the Government in their White Paper on PFM reforms that \nwas prepared in 2002. This reform program included, amongst others, the following main areas: \n\u2022  Modernizing an outdated legal environment for PFM, by issuing a modern set of laws and \nimplementing regulations; \n\u2022  Reforming an opaque and inefficient budget formulation process, by discontinuing the separate \nrecurrent  and  development  budgets,  and  introducing  performance  budgeting  systems  and \nforward estimates; \n\u2022  Reforming  budget  implementation,  in  particular  the  inefficient  payments  system  and  weak \nmonitoring arrangements; \n\u2022  Modernizing  management  of  the  Government  Treasury,  to  consolidate  fragmented  cash \nmanagement and make government banking arrangements more efficient; \n\u2022  Introducing modern Government Accounting Standards and accounting practices to improve the \nreliability of Government financial reporting; \n\u2022  Reforming arrangements for government auditing, in particular strengthening the mandate and \ncapacity of Supreme Audit Institution (BPK), addressing overlaps between external and internal \naudit agencies and clarifying their respective roles and responsibilities. \n \nSome specific aspects of reforms have been supported under the series of Development Policy Loans \nover the last three years. A commentary on the progress in implementing these reforms is given below to \nhelp determine the attendant risks arising from the borrower\u2019s capacity to receive and manage this loan \nand  help  determine  the  fiduciary  arrangements  for  this  operation.  A  summary  of  the  specific \nrecommendations made under the last CFAA and their current status is also attached. \n \nCURRENT STATUS OF PFM REFORM \u2013 A SUMMARY \n \nThe more notable achievements accomplished and shortcomings are summarized below. \nA. Regulatory Framework for PFM \n \nSubstantial progress has been made in establishing the regulatory framework for improved PFM \nby the issue and development of appropriate implementing regulations under the troika of laws \nthat were passed by Parliament during 2003 and 2004, and the other complementary laws on \nPlanning and Procurement that were passed during the same period.  \n ", "  Appendix 7      69 \nThe Law on State Finances (No. 17/ 2003), although at a high level of generality, underpins the \nreform of the Government budgeting process and is currently under implementation. It provides for \nthe first time for such basic budget processes as developing a macro-economic and fiscal framework, \nestablishing a budget timetable, setting out the budget information to be supplied to Parliament and the \nuse of internationally recognized classification standards (GFS) in developing the budget. Reforms being \nundertaken in the budget formulation area include the unification of the previous two separate budgets, \nthe  development  of  an  MTEF  system  and  the  introduction  of  performance  based  budgeting.  A \ncomplementary piece of legislation has also been passed, viz., the State Development Planning System \nLaw (2004), which provides the legal basis for the national development planning process, and for the \nlinking of planning with budgeting. \nThe State Treasury Law (No. 1/ 2004) provides the basis for modernizing budget execution and \nreporting. Treasury reforms being undertaken include steps to rationalize the current proliferation of \ngovernment bank accounts and to centralize cash management, simplify and speed up the payments \nsystem, and to improve reporting on budget execution. Government financial reporting will also be \nimproved through the implementation of government accounting standards on a modified accrual basis, \nwith an eventual move to full accrual accounting.  \n \nThe State Audit Law (No. 15 / 2004) lays out the broad legal framework for the operation on the \ncountry\u2019s supreme audit institution, BPK,1 to reinforce its position and mandate as an external \naudit institution equal to but reporting to Parliament. While the audit law takes the important step of \nestablishing BPK as the only external auditor and the Supreme Audit Institution in the country, the Law \ndoes not adequately resolve some remaining conflicts arising from BPK\u2019s role nor does it remove \nrestrictions on its scope as articulated in some older legislation, for example with respect to BPK\u2019s access \nto records of Tax Revenues department. In addition, the State Audit Law did not cover the institutional \narrangements for the management and oversight of BPK, for which a separate law (BPK Law) - was \nenacted on 16 October 2006 (Law No.15/06). \n   \nProcurement Presidential Decree (80/2003) introduces many improvements in the procurement \nregime in Indonesia and lays out a plan for establishing a national policy formulation and oversight \nagency. An omnibus procurement law is envisaged for consolidating, clarifying and simplifying the \nnumerous  procurement  rules  and  regulations.  This  law,  currently  under  preparation,  would  further \nstrengthen the legal foundation for modernizing public procurement.  \n \nAn analysis of the recent PFM laws and their implementing regulations indicates that substantial \nprogress  has  been  made  in  preparing  and  issuing  the  required  implementing  regulations, \nalthough some draft regulations are pending formal release as of the date of this analysis. In \nIndonesia, given the traditionally high level of generality in legislation, laws usually require one or more \nGovernment  Regulations  to  define  and  govern  their  implementation  followed  by  Decrees  from  the \nPresident and or Ministers to establish the systems and procedures necessary for their operation. The \nState Finances Law, Treasury Law and the State Audit Law are no exception.  \n \nAll the main implementing regulations for the State Finance Law have been issued, with the \nexception of a detailed manual on implementing the national budget (Article 14), for which a draft has \nbeen  prepared  and  is  being  finalized.  The  issued  regulations  include  Government  regulations  on \nGovernment Work Plan, National Government Departments Annual Plan and Budget Deficit. A set of \nMinisterial Decrees have also been issued to regulate Regional Borrowings and Adjustment Funds. \n \nWith respect to the State Treasury Law, a number of Government Regulations have been issued to \nregulate aspects of budget execution and others are at an advanced stage of preparation. These \ninclude  specific  financial  management  provisions  for  designated  General  Public  Service  Agencies \n(23/2005), promulgation of Government Accounting Standards (24/2005), write-off of State receivables \n(14/2005), State Asset Management (6/2006) and Finance and Performance Reporting (8/2006). In \naddition, Ministerial decrees have been issued on aspects such as management of inter-governmental \n                                                 \n1 Badan Permeriksa Keuangan \n ", "70    Appendix 7   \ndebt  and  draft  regulations  are  at  an  advanced  stage  of  preparation  or  approval,  including  cash \nmanagement,  internal  controls  and  Budget  Implementation,  which  are  awaiting  issue  pending  the \nresolution of some institutional issues within the Government.  \n \nThe Government Regulation on Government Internal Controls Systems (Pengendalian Inter Pemerintah) \nis expected to cover the objective, scope, and responsibility of internal control systems, including the role \nof internal audit agencies. However, there remains disagreement within the Government over the scope \nand content of some parts of the regulation, in particular the implications for the future of internal audit \nagencies involved in exercising internal controls. The issue of this regulation is pending resolution of this \nmatter.  \n \nA new regulation on Cash Management has similarly been drafted and is considered a key step in \nunderpinning the proposed Treasury Single Account. The full implementation of this will involve shifting \nlarge cash surpluses of the Government from commercial banks, where these are currently placed free of \ncharge, to the central bank in a zero-balance arrangement. An agreement has not yet been reached with \nthe central bank on the extent and manner of compensation to the government for these balances, \npending which the draft regulation has not been issued. \n \nA  new  Government  Regulation  on  Budget  Implementation  (Pelaksanaan  Anggaran)  currently  being \ndrafted will underpin new budget implementation procedures. Many of the procedures proposed in this \ndraft regulation are already being applied, under cover of interim circulars issued by the Director General \nTreasury to help test out and develop the detailed procedures. \n \nFor the State Audit Law (15/2004) no implementing legislation has yet been issued. Seven separate \nactions are required to implement Law 15/04; namely, four implementing regulations, a concept Manual, \nand two Memoranda of Understanding to implement articles 14 and 17 (7). The four regulations comprise \nexternal auditing standards (in fulfillment of Article 5 (2), out-sourcing of experts to BPK (in fulfillment of \nArticle 9 (3), issue of audit summons (in fulfillment of Articles 11 and 10.d), and guidance on settlement of \nlosses to the State (in fulfillment of Article 22 (4). The concept Manual on Investigative Audit is in \nfulfillment of Article 13. The two memoranda of understanding relate to guidance on submission of fraud \nin audit findings (Article 14), and; guidance on submission of audit reports to the legislative body (Article \n17) For many of these, in particular the more important ones on auditing standards and issue of audit \nreports to Parliament, drafts are ready and under discussion with members of the Executive (e.g. the \nAccounting and Auditing Standards Committee) and the Parliament. These regulations will be issued by \nthe BPK Board, not by the Government, and the enabling legal provisions for this authority are now \nincluded in the recently-enacted BPK Law referred to above. \n \nIn conclusion, the regulatory framework to enable and guide the implementation of PFM reforms \nis  now  substantially  in  place,  and  the  year  ahead  will  see  the  focus  shift  more  clearly  to \nimplementation, where the challenges will no doubt be substantial. \n \nB. Early Experience in Implementing Reforms \n \nThe Government has recognized early some key challenges in moving beyond the development of \nappropriate laws and regulations to their effective implementation. As an integral part of the change \nmanagement process, the Government reorganized the Ministry of Finance. This was accomplished \nreasonably well during 2005, in particular by creating a new DG Budget and Fiscal Balance and a new \nDG Treasury, broadly in line with earlier IMF recommendations. Both the budget and treasury functions \nhave been strengthened by these changes. In particular DG Treasury now oversees all treasury functions \nincluding cash and debt management, fixed asset management and government fiscal reporting.  \n \nMost recently in October 2006, the Minister of Finance has sought to further strengthen and \nsynergize  the  management  of  reforms,  by  setting  up  an  office  for  Policy  Analysis  and \nHarmonization  reporting  directly  to  her.  It  is  anticipated  that  this  office  will  help  expedite  and \ncoordinate the completion of the reform agenda. \n ", "  Appendix 7      71 \n \nBudgeting Reforms \n \nNew measures that have been introduced through the new State Finance Law are gradually \nimproving  fiscal  transparency.  Budget  documents  for  2005  and  2006  have  become  more \ncomprehensive and informative. These improvements include (i) the new economic and fiscal framework \n(ii) clearer expenditure classification, including the integration of routine and development budgets, and \npresentation of budgets consistent with the GFS 2001. \nPlanning and budgeting functions have also been clarified, although more needs to be done to \nimprove qualitative aspects and improve coordination between Bappenas and Ministry of Finance. \nPlanning and budgeting have been integrated by formally linking line ministry work plans with budgets. \nThe respective roles of BAPPENAS and MOF in budget preparation have been clarified, with BAPPENAS \nassuming full responsibility for the planning process (including preparation of the work plans) and MOF \nhaving the leading role in the formulation of the annual budget. However, early experience suggests that \nthere is a need to further strengthen cross agency coordination between BAPPENAS, MOF and the line \nministries to facilitate the move to performance based budgeting process. Improvements include the \ntimely  submission  of  budgets  to  Parliament  within  the  budget  cycle,  although  there  are  persistent \nconcerns about the quality of performance budgets submitted by Line Ministries. The implementation of \nthe  MTEF  has  not  been  very  effective  to  date and  will require  more  intensive  training  and wider \ndissemination of the concept. \n \nSome specific implementation experience during 2005 and 2006 is highlighted below: \n \na. A new functional and program classification consistent with the IMF GFSM 2001 for cash based \ntransactions has been implemented. Budget allocations have begun to be based on sector strategies and \nprograms rather than historical expenditures. However the program classification requires further review \nto ensure it adequately reflects the objectives of or the program management approach used by individual \nspending ministries.  \n \nb. The earlier model of separate recurrent and development budgets have now been formally \nunified, with components from the former development budget reclassified to the appropriate economic \ncategories. However, unification of the underlying substance of these two groups may not be entirely \nconsistent in all agencies. \n \nc. Progress in implementing MTEF has been limited. Forward estimates have been introduced for the \nfirst time, although much more work needs to be done to fully adopt the MTEF approach. The Work Plan \nregulations provide for indicative budget ceilings to be issued for two years out but in the 2006 budgets \nindicative ceilings have been issued only for the forthcoming budget year.  \n \nd. There has been limited progress in developing a more performance oriented budget. Although a \nstart was made with the fiscal 2005 budget, full implementation will take more time as there appears to be \nlimited understanding and no clear strategy yet developed to operationalize this concept. Spending \nministries do not appear to fully understand the objectives of the new work plans and budget documents \nand so far these appear to have been an extensive paper exercise with little discernible impact on \nresource allocation. Strong collaboration between DG Budget and Bappenas is needed, ensuring that \nthey act collaboratively and consistently and that planning is fully integrated into the budget as envisaged \nunder performance budgeting.  \n \ne. Severe delays were experienced in issuing budget authorization documents (DIPA) in 2005, \nalthough significant improvements were made in 2006. In the past years, these documents were often \nmade available to line agencies not until after April of the running year. As a result, a high proportion of \nthe total funding provided under the approved budget to spending agencies could not be executed or \ndisbursed until the last quarter of the fiscal year. Often virtually no such commitments or disbursements \ncould occur in the first two quarters other than purely routine expenditure (such as salaries of civil \nservants). \n ", "72    Appendix 7   \n \nAmong the main reasons for this delay during 2005 was the inadequate understanding of the \nnewly introduced budgeting procedures among a large number of spending agencies in the \nGovernment.  It appears that Line Agencies had not been adequately trained in these. These budgeting \nchanges introduced a whole new way of preparing budget estimates, performance based budgets and \nunderlying work plans, and these often had to undergo several revisions before being accepted, leading \nto significant delays. In addition, current procedures require that spending patterns are set centrally and \nmid-year adjustments are often difficult. Allowing for more flexibility in this process without putting in place \nother safeguards will speed up spending but may increase the risk of excess waste.  \n \nFor the budget year 2006, the DIPA issue process seemed to have stabilized. These documents \nwere issued for all spending agencies in January 2006 and the disbursement position is better than \nbefore, although spending patterns have still not improved dramatically, with aggregate government \nspending as of September 2006 standing at 62% of the budgeted funds. A related constraint that \ncontinues  to  affect  expenditure  patterns  is  the  absence  of  authorization  to  carry-over  of  unspent \ncommitments at year-ends, given the one-year life of all DIPAs. Although a one-time waiver for this was \nauthorized in 2005, this needs to be regularized for all development expenditure so that this can be \ndistributed more evenly through the year. \n \nTreasury Management Reforms \n \nThe implementation experience with Budget execution processes is less satisfactory, with a \ngradual modernization at Ministry of Finance and very little impact on the control environments at \nspending agencies. Some highlights are discussed below: \n \na.  Introduction of a Treasury Single Account (TSA) and automation of the treasury payments \nsystem are key reforms and progress in pilot testing of the underlying concepts has been slow. \nAlthough a detailed work plan for this was developed in 2005, especially for the establishment of the \nTreasury Single Account (TSA) which involves the progressive rationalization of the vast number of \nseparate government bank accounts. Supporting the management of state finance resources requires \nminimizing central government idle cash/cash float, reducing maintenance cost of too many accounts, \nfacilitating cash forecasting and cash management control, as well as enhancing transparency and \naccountability of central government banking.   \nPilots for zero balance transitory accounts have been completed in three locations: Jakarta, Bekasi \nand Batam since 2005. Expansion and roll-out of the pilot are on hold due to delays in passage and \nissuance  of  Government  Regulation  on  Cash  Management  (see  above).  A  committee  has  been \nestablished  within  DG  Treasury  to  seek  quotations  from  commercial  banks  for  remuneration  of \ntransactional  banking  services  (TBS).  An  extension  of  this  pilot  to  an  additional  50  KPPNs  has \ncommenced effective Sept. 1, 2006. Gradual implementation of TSA (expenditure and revenue accounts) \nin all KPPNs is proposed for mid-2007 in a phased manner. \nIn the meanwhile, the proliferation of unauthorized and unaccounted bank accounts continues. A \nrecent audit by BPK has discovered Government bank accounts at 63 banks which are in the personal \nname of a Government official, a project or a Badan (unincorporated body or agency). Many of these \nwere not earlier known to the Treasury. These include 680 current accounts and 623 term deposit \naccounts. Total balances in these accounts amount to a sizable Rp8.5 trillion. The Ministry of Finance has \nso far not been successful in inventorizing all such accounts that exist and bring them into accountability \nand control.  \n \nAs part of improving cash management there is a need to reduce delays in revenue remittances into \ngovernment bank accounts, which sometimes can be up to a few months. For instance, balances in the \nservices clearing account in 2005 from the Reforestation Account were not deposited in the State \nTreasury for a few months. Treasury cash management and payment modernization will be supported by \nthe planned computerized treasury information management system (SPAN) under the World Bank \nGFMRAP project.  \n ", "  Appendix 7      73 \n \nb. Some parts of the MOF (Directorate of Treasury) organization has been rationalized to support \nrationalization of the treasury system. Regional accounting offices (KAR) and local verification offices \n(KASIPA) have been merged with regional administrative offices (KANWIL) under DG Treasury, with \ntreasury payment and accounting field offices (KPPNs) coming under KANWILs. While there has been \ntraining for MOF staff this has not yet extended to staff in the Spending Ministries, who thus lack \nawareness of the proposed changes. This is likely to severely constrain effective implementation of on-\ngoing reforms at the centre. Further complementary ongoing reengineering of business processes is \nneeded to introduce internal checks and balances, and diminish the potential for rent-seeking that hitherto \ncharacterized virtually all stages of budget formulation and execution in Indonesia. \n \nc. The procurement of a new treasury system (SPAN) to be funded by the World Bank under \nGFMRAP is delayed. The new treasury management system is intended to improve accounting and \nreporting for treasury transactions, increase transparency in budget formulation and budget execution and \nreduce transaction costs.  \n \nd. The development and adoption of new Government Accounting Standards is a good step \nforward to improve financial reporting, though the requirement of the State Treasury law of the \ncomplete introduction of accrual accounting by 2008 is very ambitious and may not be realistic. \nThe Accounting Standards Committee (KSAP) has been in operation for a few years now during which \ntime they have put in place a due process for development of Government accounting standards that are \nwell aligned with comparable international standards (IPSA\u2019s). An initial set of 11 government accounting \nstandards have been formally adopted through the issue of a Government Regulation (No. 25/2005). \nThese standards are on a modified accrual basis, and the intention is to move to full accrual standards by \n2008.  \n \nEffective 2006, these accounting standards are now already applicable across government and each \nministry and agency is expected prepare a financial accountability statement based on these standards. \nDouble entry accounting has now been introduced in all Ministries, and standalone accounting packages \nhave been installed at line ministries in a modular fashion \u2013 SPM for Budget execution and SAI for \naccounting and reporting. Implementing these new standards across government however is a major \nchallenge  and  will  require  extensive  training  as  well  as  some  re-engineering  of  related  business \nprocesses in line ministries and agencies. This task will impose challenges, given inherently weak \ncapacities in Ministries.   \n \ne. In the area of fiscal reporting, progress has been made by the Ministry of Finance in the timely \npreparation of aggregate financial statements, including a Balance Sheet, Budget Realization \nreport and Cash Flow Statement. Government prepared an aggregate set of financial statements for the \nyear 2004 for the first time. This exercise was repeated for fiscal 2005, and aggregate financial statement \nwere handed over to BPK end-March 2006 for audit, well within mandatory time targets. This aggregation \nprocess is a complex one, involving consolidation of over 19,000 budget reporting units from 1000 \nreporting entities, and this is a commendable achievement. Improvements have also been made in the \ncomprehensive disclosures made in these financial statements on the accounting policies and details on \nrevenues, expenditures, assets and liabilities. \n \nThe DG Treasury now has the ability to generate flash reports on budget disbursements (LRA) \nand revenue receipts transactions conducted through the local State Treasury Service Offices \n(KPPN) and the State Treasury, though there appears to be a reluctance at MOF to publicly \ndisclose such (unaudited and unreconciled) data.  Mechanisms and procedures for the preparation of \nBudget Realization Reports (LRA) are outlined in PerMen Keu 59/2005. Delays have been reduced in the \naggregation of KPPN transactions and reconciliation of these with ministry work unit (satker) records by \nthe DG Regional Offices (Kanwil DJPBN). In the past, such differences have been significant, including \ndifferences with some agencies within the Ministry of Finance such as Tax and Customs & Excise \nDirectorates.  In  preparing  the  Financial  Statements  for  FY  2005  such  differences  continue  to  be \nsignificant, although early in FY 2006 some new processes have been introduced to allow reconciliation \n ", "74    Appendix 7   \nbetween treasury offices and line agencies on a monthly basis at KPPN level and quarterly basis at \nprovincial / Kanwil level. The relevant instructions and operating manuals to guide this process have been \nissued as Circular Letters (SE) by Ministry of Finance.   \nEfforts have been made to integrate nominal LRA reporting with budget ceilings as formalized through the \nBudget Activity Lists (DIPA) to enable reporting of expenditure as a percentage of allocated budget \nresources. Although LRAs2 based on new classification structures can be generated with ease, the \nperiodic publishing of such reports \u2013 for internal and external purposes - has yet to be institutionalized. \nRather, reporting is ad-hoc and limited to aggregate (central government wide) figures. DG Treasury has \nlaunched a new website in 2006 with a designated page for public reporting of periodic LRA. However, to \ndate LRA has not been posted on the site. \nPending the introduction of a Treasury Single Account, some positive interim measures have \nbeen taken during 2006 to improve accountability of dispersed Government bank accounts. To \nhelp enforce greater reliability of the bank balance figures at the year-end and to identify cases of major \ndifferences between reported and actual bank balances, MOF has instituted a procedure to obtain from \nall Treasury offices (KPPN) copies of the year-end bank statements of the operational bank accounts \nunder their management.   \n \nDespite the good initial taken there continue to be serious shortcomings in the reliability of \ngovernment  financial  statements,  reflecting  the  immense  challenges  that  lie  ahead  in  an \nenvironment  where  accounting  capacities  at  the  grassroots  are  weak  and  the  accounting \nprocesses not yet integrated or fully automated. Some of the major issues in reliability that have been \nraised by the external auditors in the audited 2005 financial statements include the following: \n \n1) Significant differences between revenues as reported respectively by KPPN and the Tax Office. To \nresolve this MOF has recently designed a new comprehensive web-based Revenue Management \nInformation System. \n \n2) The Balance Sheet of the central government for the year 2005 has reported a balance of Rp 60 \nTrillion as Long Term Non permanent Investment (RDI) and District Development Fund (RPD). This \ncomprises government receivables from BUMN3, BUMD and regional governments from Foreign \nLoans (SLA) loans from RDI and loans from RPD. Although the year-end balance has been recorded \nin the aggregate Balance Sheet, transactions during the year, such as authorization and drawdown of \nnew loans, loans recovered and financing charges paid or earned, are not recorded in the financial \nstatements.  In addition, procedures for authorization of movements from these funds during the year \nare not clear. This has reduced the level of transparency in and accountability for these funds. \n \n3) Procedures for recording, valuing and reporting procedure for Fixed Asset as State assets were not \nin accordance with the accounting system. Management of fixed assets in Ministries and Institutions is \nnot yet in accordance with regulations and laws. \n \n4) The value of permanent investments in State Owned Enterprises (BUMN) which is presented in the \n2005 Balance Sheet were not based on valid accounting principles and contained some significant \nomissions. All holdings in SOE\u2019s were valued on the basis of net equity, using the latest available \naccounts. Despite the fact that nearly all holdings in BUMN are 100% no attempt is made to prepare \nconsolidated accounts for government and its subsidiaries. \n \nAudit Issues \n \nThe BPK \u2013 the country\u2019s supreme audit institution - now has a stronger mandate though the \nstaffing and resources provided to it do not fully correspond to its new mandate. The new Audit \nLaw (15/2004) strengthens the role of BPK and clarifies its role across all three levels of government and \n                                                 \n2 Laporan Realisasi Anggaran or Budget Realization Reports \n3 State Owned Enterprises \n ", "  Appendix 7      75 \nhas considerably expanded the scope of its audit. However, military institutions are currently not subject \nto audit. Existing regulations also place some limitations on the ability of BPK to audit all revenue \nagencies such as the tax department. As a result, for the year 2005 BPK was not able to audit tax \nrevenues and tax receivables, which account for about 70% of total public revenues. In comparison to the \nresources provided to internal audit institutions, BPK has a physical presence in only 9 or the 26 \nprovinces of the countries, whereas the central internal audit agency (BPKP) has an (under-utilized) \npresence in each of these 26 provinces. As a result, BPK is able to cover less than 60% of the local \ngovernments in its annual work program. \n \nThe BPK submits summary reports of audits undertaken to parliament annually and half yearly. In \naddition, BPK presents audited accounts of municipalities and regions to parliament. These reports certify \nthe financial statements of the audited reporting entities, and in addition comment on any irregularities or \ninefficiencies in budget execution that may have been noted. Public disclosure of all BPK audit reports is \nnow mandatory \n \nInternal audit and Controls \n \nThe mandates of the three internal audit institutions continue to be unclear as is the allocation of \nresources between them. Internal audit is within the remit of the BPKP, the Inspector General (IG) of \neach ministry, and the Bawasdas of municipalities and regional governments. Ironically, even with (or \nperhaps because of) multiple internal audit agencies in existence, the internal audit function continues to \nbe a chronically weak link in governance. \n \nAt present the BPKP\u2019s mandate is unclear. It can assist IGs, municipalities and regions upon invitation, \nit provides training in auditing for these entities. Although its mandate has reduced significantly, it \nmaintains fully staffed decentralized offices in some 26 provinces in the country. A key regulation on \ninternal controls under the State Audit Law (Law No.15/2004) \u2013 being supported by ADB as part of the \nSTAR Program \u2013 deals with addressing the inconsistencies. It is expected to clarify the roles and \nresponsibility of BPKP versus the other internal control organs of the Government. In the meantime, the \nenactment of the Law on the Supreme Audit Institution Law (BPK Law No.15/2006) \u2013 passed by \nParliament on 30 October 2006 \u2013 has given the much needed boost to clarify BPK\u2019s position and \nauthority. \n \nThe IGs have different roles in different ministries. Their actual mandate, staffing and activities are \ndetermined by the minister in charge of the ministry in which they operate. The IGs are therefore not \noperating as one institution, but rather as 20 institutions corresponding to the number of ministries and \nministers. Generally they focus on routine technical and performance audits (including compliance with \ntechnical standards) conducted on a random basis or in accordance with an approved annual audit plan, \nbut not on a risk based methodology. Reports are not available to the public or the DPR. Professional \nbackgrounds of staff IG therefore normally include technical qualifications and not accounting or auditing. \n \nThe  audit  of  financial  transactions  in  the  35  provinces,  442  districts  and  2  regencies  are \nundertaken in a very complex institutional set up. The BPK is the external auditor of all local \ngovernments. In each district and province a Bawasda is established to undertake what they call \u2018general\u2019 \naudit of regional budget expenditure. However, Bawasda\u2019s generally do not have the skills of staff to \nundertake all audit responsibilities.  \n \nThe allocation of resources between the internal audit institutions is unclear and there does not \nseem to be strong cooperation and coordination between them. This hampers the realization of \nsynergies between the institutions. The audit of local governments in particularly lacks transparency and \nis needlessly complex. \n  \nInternal control mechanisms across government need strengthening. These comprise all rules, \nprocedures and business processes that are applied in the execution of the budget, to ensure that public \nfunds are safeguarded from waste, inefficiency and fraud and comply with approved laws, regulations and \npolicies. A key internal control in public expenditure management is the Expenditure Control and Payment \n ", "76    Appendix 7   \nSystem. In order to strengthen the responsibility and accountability over the appropriated budget by the \nline ministry, recent budget execution regulations have transferred the function of payment order issuance \nto the line ministries, resulting in a better segregation of functions of verifying transactions and issuing \npayments. While this segregation of duties is well designed, implementation experience is not entirely \nsatisfactory. One endemic weakness that has been noted in accounting practices has been the quality of \naccounting evidence that is accepted for payments by the Treasury as well as Line Agency financial staff. \n \nProcurement Policy \nThe issuance of Presidential Decree (80/2003) promotes the basic principles of procurement: \ntransparency, open and fair competition, economy, and efficiency. It covers all areas of procurement that \nuse public funds and contracting entities at all levels of government. The decree meets most of what is \ngenerally regarded as accepted international practice. However, the pace of Indonesia\u2019s commendable \ndecentralization  reforms  has  had  an  impact  on  public  sector  procurement  as  different  levels  of \ngovernment \u2013 from ministers, governors, and even mayors \u2013 are able to issue their own decrees, \nregulations, and instructions. The plethora of regulations is often inconsistent with one another and many \ndo not meet accepted international practice. As a consequence, national procurement reforms and the \nneed for national procurement policies and standards have become urgent. One key step in this direction \nis the creation of a National Public Procurement Office (NPPO), which the Government had committed to \nundertaking  in  2001.  However,  progress  has  lagged  in  making  the  NPPO  fully  operational.  The \nPresidential Decree 80/2003 required that the NPPO be established by January 1, 2005. A lot of work has \nalready been done and is on-going, in both preparing for the establishment of the NPPO and also in \ndeveloping institutional capacity.   \nThis measure however remains a contentious issue and the Minister of Finance has stated that \nmany other aspects of the procurement framework could be improved beyond the specific issue \nof the NPPO. For example, a centralized training and procurement practitioner\u2019s certification system is \nunder development with certification at various levels. The system has commenced targeting government \nprocurement practitioners with initial certification to the basic level by means of a computerized testing \nsystem.    \nDecentralization \nIndonesia has transformed itself from one of the most centralized countries in the world to one of the most \ndecentralized countries within a short period of time. In 2004, the regions commanded about 35 percent \nof total Government spending. Given the sharp increase in regional transfers in 2006, the regional share \nin total public investment is likely to rise above 50 percent in 2006. One of the most important pending \ndecentralization reforms is on on-lending and on-granting regulations and the transition to market-\noriented system of sub-national credit. The Government has recently issued revisions to on-lending and \non-granting decrees to facilitate immediate support for local infrastructure finance and service delivery. \nMore work is however needed to establish a regulatory framework for the development of more market-\nbased system of sub-national credit, including the issuance of regional bonds (based on Law 33/2004). \nThe BAPPENAS blue book decree has been signed and issued (PerMen PPN No. 5 2006) and the on-\ngranting and on-lending decrees have been signed by the Minister of Finance.  \nRespective roles and responsibilities of MOF and Home Affairs with respect to financial reporting by local \ngovernments have not been fully resolved, although some amendments to earlier decrees have been \nmade to harmonize local government financial reporting with that applicable to central government. \n \nKEY AREAS FOR FUTURE ATTENTION \u2013 PFM \n \nProgress in implementing reforms has been slower than what development partners and the \ngovernment would like. To some degree this has been due to the distraction of managing string of \nnatural disasters recently experienced in the country. The lack of financial management capacity in the \n ", "  Appendix 7      77 \ngovernment is also a significant a contributory factor in slowing down the pace of implementation of \nreforms. In the period ahead, progress of the following key on-going PFM reforms will need to be closely \nwatched: \n \n\u2022  Ensuring  greater  integrity  and  more  effective  management  of  public  funds  through  the \nimplementation of a Treasury Single Account, automating the treasury payments system, and \ninstitution of measures to prevent the proliferation of off-budget bank accounts. \n\u2022  Strengthening external oversight of all public funds, by further enhancing the physical and human \ncapacity of BPK, and strengthening legislative capacity for oversight of budget execution. \n\u2022  Strengthening  internal  controls  in  government,  including  the  internal  audit  institutions  by \nrationalizing the number of institutions that now exist; \n\u2022  Increasing  revenue  collection  and  eliminating  revenue  leakages  through  governance, \naccountability-enhancing reforms to the tax and customs administrations and enabling audit \noversight of tax revenues. \n\u2022     Implementation  of  a  government  financial  management  information  system,  successful \nimplementation of Government Accounting Standards and reengineering of underlying business \nprocesses to ensure reliable financial reporting. \n \n\u2022     Extending  modern  financial  accountability  and  management  processes  to  sub-national \ngovernments and bringing these fully in line with international and emerging national standards.  \n \nManagement of Foreign Exchange \n \nThe foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The country is \nno longer subject to the Extended Arrangement from the IMF. Bank Indonesia (BI) was last subject to the \ntransitional  procedures  under  the  Fund\u2019s  safeguards  assessment  policy  in  2002.  That  assessment \nrecommended remedial actions to address a number of vulnerabilities in the audit arrangements for the \ncentral bank. The main recommendations have been implemented, including the establishment of an \nindependent audit committee at BI and the publication of BI\u2019s audited financial statements. Audited \nfinancial statements for Bank Indonesia for the year 2005 have been reviewed and we note that the audit \nreport issued by BPK, the State Audit Board, contained an unqualified audit opinion. \n \nConclusion \n \nWeaknesses  in  the  financial  management  and  accountability  identified  in  the  past  continue  to  be \ngradually addressed through the PFM reform program discussed above, and supported by the DPL \ntriggers as well as the GFMRAP project and other initiatives. These will generate some fiduciary risks for \nthis operation. Although the pace of implementing the planned reforms has been somewhat slow over the \nlast year, the trajectory of reform is in the right direction and the current Government continues to \ndemonstrate a commitment to continue the task of completing the planned reforms in PFM. Taking these \ninto consideration, we do not propose putting in place any additional fiduciary arrangements for this \noperation. \n ", "78    Appendix 7   \n Table A7.1: Status of CFAA Key Recommendations (October 2006) \nCFAA Recommendation  Status as of October 2006 \nImproving the Control Environment  Laws have been legislated as separate laws.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nThe National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) has five basic strategies for poverty reduction: (i) broadening \nopportunities, (ii) empowering community institutions, (iii) increasing capacity, (iv) providing social protection, and \n(v) promoting global partnerships. The NPRS is to be implemented through macroeconomic strategy and policies for \nfulfilling  basic  rights,  promoting  gender  justice  and  equality,  and  regional  development.  The  NPRS  considers \nmacroeconomic policies as the foundation for reducing poverty through a supportive business environment and broad \nopportunities for increasing the capability of the poor through four related objectives to (i) create macroeconomic \nstability,  (ii)  promote  economic  growth,  (iii)  increase  opportunities  for  employment  and  entrepreneurship,  and \n(iv) reduce inequalities between regions. The NPRS considers the willingness of central and local governments to \nmanage the budget in an open, accountable, efficient, and effective way\u2014an essential prerequisite for implementing \nthe NPRS. It recognizes that partnerships are necessary for implementing the NPRS with the private sector, and \nfinancial and nonfinancial banking institutions are identified as key stakeholders.  \n \nThe country poverty assessment1 and country poverty partnership agreement2 consider macroeconomic stability as a \nfundamental underpinning to poverty reduction. Under the agreement, ADB has agreed to support the Government to \npromote macroeconomic stability for inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Highest priority is given to institutional \nreforms to achieve transparent and accountable institutions. The poverty agreement also calls for expansion and \nimprovement of key basic services such as health, education, water supply, and sanitation through public-private \npartnerships and the need to expand a system of social protection. At the same time, the poverty partnership \nagreement notes the tremendous fiscal constraint facing the Government in the medium term, and therefore the need \nto make the best use of existing resources.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe Development Policy Loan (DPL) series, as cofinanced by the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP) by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), directly supports implementation of the NPRS as envisioned by the poverty \npartnership agreement. The DPSP focuses on key areas central to implementing the NPRS strategy. The core areas \nof the program are   \n(i)  ensuring macroeconomic stability,  \n(ii)  improving the investment climate,  \n(iii)  improving public financial management, and  \n(iv)  improving public service delivery for the poor.   \n \nThe actions under each of these core areas directly correspond to the NPRS strategy or implementing mechanism. \nThe links between DPSP-2 actions and the NPRS are shown in Table A8.1. \n \nThe DPSP-2 actions are essential for implementing the NPRS. A few key features with a pro-poor focus are \nhighlighted below: \n\u2022  Continuing focus on public expenditure reorientation towards pro-poor needs (e.g. the 2006 budget has \nallocated over $6 billion in additional resources for health, education, and community infrastructure needs) \n\u2022  Enhancing analytical capacity within the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for improving fiscal policy, which in turn \nwould help accelerate economic growth by formulating effective tax and fiscal decentralization measures \n\u2022  Streamlining on-granting procedures to channel development assistance from national to local governments \n\u2022  Considerably enhancing transparency and accountability in public financial management \n\u2022  Improving overall governance through providing adequate protection for witnesses who provide information, \namong others for instance, on poor implementation of government programs \n\u2022  Undertaking  and  institutionalizing  in-depth  pro-poor  program  assessments,  and  using  the  findings  in \nimproving the ongoing unconditional cash transfer (UCT) program and designing the proposed conditional \ncash transfer (CCT) program  \n \n ", "  Appendix 8      81 \n \nTable A8.1: Links between the National Poverty Reduction Strategy  \nand the DPL/DPSP Actions  \n \nNational Poverty  Development Policy Support Program Actions \nReduction Strategy  \nMacroeconomic Stability   \nFiscal policy directed to  \u2022  Reduce subsidies to non-poor, and effectively use savings for pro-poor   \nmore effective and efficient        programs \nmanagement of the state  \u2022  Improve tax revenue administration \nbudget and revenues, and  \u2022  Develop a debt management strategy.  \nmanagement of foreign  \u2022  Implement Law No. 33/2004 including redesign of Ministry of Finance decree  \nloans and grants        on onlending and on-granting \n\u2022  Reallocate central Government-sponsored funding to Special Purpose Grants. \nTransparency and  \u2022  Complete implementing regulations: State Finance Law, Treasury Law, and \naccountability of the state    Audit Law  \nfinance  \u2022  Develop and implement a timetable for a single treasury account \n\u2022  Establish an operations unit with powers to investigate fraud \n\u2022  Submit a Witness Protection Law to parliament (subsequently enacted) \n\u2022  Initiate civil service reforms \n \nBasic Rights    \nBasic services such as  \u2022  Improve targeting of the poor \nhealth, education, and  \u2022  Learn from existing compensation programs to improve them \nwater supply access to  \u2022  Develop a new rationalized social safety net by 2007, possibly including a pilot \ndecent work; and reduction  conditional cash transfer program.

Implementation of the compensation programs initiated  in March  2005 and October 2005 by the \nGovernment will provide additional insights. These lessons will enable the Government to develop better targeted and \nmore transparent programs to accelerate implementation of the NPRS. ADB\u2019s parallel sector interventions (e.g. the \nPoverty Reduction and Millennium Development Goal [MDG] Acceleration Program) will provide reinforcing support. \nThe DPSP also supports enhanced private sector participation in NPRS implementation through broad-ranging \nmeasures,  by  reducing  transaction  costs  associated  with  investments  and  removing  registration  delays  and \nuncertainties. It will support financial intermediation for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Infrastructure \ndevelopment will receive attention, through support for allocation of resources for public sector risk sharing. These \nmeasures will help attract productive investments to generate employment.    \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?
