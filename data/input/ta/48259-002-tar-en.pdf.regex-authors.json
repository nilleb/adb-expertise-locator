INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will enhance financial resilience to \ndisasters triggered by natural hazards, epidemics, and pandemics in selected developing member \ncountries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The TA will support (i) assessments of \nthe enabling environment for disaster, epidemic, and pandemic risk financing in Cambodia, the \nKyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and the Philippines; (ii) regional knowledge-sharing events in Central\u2013\nWest, South, and Southeast Asia on developing risk financing frameworks;  (iii) the development \nof two disaster insurance products in Nepal; and (iv) a disaster public expenditure and institutional \nreview in Nepal. The TA will build on the Strengthening the Enabling Environment for Disaster \nRisk Financing (Phase 1) project.1 The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, focusing on social protection systems, strengthening women\u2019s resilience \nto external shocks, building climate and disaster resilience, strengthening institutional capacity to \nrespond to economic shocks, and increasing support for regional public goods and collective \naction to mitigate cross-border risks.2 The TA is included in the 2020 Management-approved \nresults-based work plan of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department \n(SDCC).3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Adverse economic and social impacts. ADB DMCs are extremely vulnerable to natural \nhazards. From 2000 to 2019, disasters in DMCs have killed almost 716,000 people; affected 3.3 \nbillion people; and caused direct physical losses totaling $676 billion\u201427% of the global total.4 \nDisasters have had devastating economic and social impacts, not only resulting in damage to \ninfrastructure, crops, and housing but also leading to loss of government revenues, disruptions in \ntrade and commerce, and market destabilization. Health emergencies, especially epidemics and \npandemics, also pose a substantial risk, leading to both morbidity and mortality and substantial \neconomic dislocation over a wide geographic area, as demonstrated by the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19), declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. \nImmediately affected poor and near-poor households may suffer the adverse effects of disaster \nand health shocks for decades as livelihoods are disrupted, limited savings are eliminated, debt \nis accumulated, and children are sometimes permanently withdrawn from education to boost \nearnings. Marginalized groups such as women, children, the elderly, the disabled, and minorities \nare  particularly  vulnerable  to  natural  hazards,  mirroring  wider  socioeconomic  and  cultural \ninequalities. \n \n3.  Risk financing options. Confronted with fiscal challenges that disasters and pandemics \npresent, policy makers in DMCs are seeking to strengthen ex ante or pre-disaster and ex post \npost-disaster risk financing options to ensure that populations, businesses, and governments \nhave  the  resources  to  improve  preparedness;  facilitate  timely  relief,  early  recovery,  and \nreconstruction;  and  build  back  better.  Ex  ante  instruments  include  setting  aside  reserves; \nestablishing  contingent  financing  arrangements;  and  using  risk  transfer  products  involving \nindemnity and parametric insurance, reinsurance, and capital market solutions. Ex post or post-\ndisaster funding instruments include recurrent and capital budget reallocations, domestic and \nexternal credit, tax increases, and development partner assistance. \n \n1  ADB. 2015.

Challenges to uptake of risk financing instruments. Despite increased recognition of \nthe need to enhance financial resilience to disasters and health shocks, uptake of risk financing \ninstruments remains low in ADB DMCs, particularly in the poorest countries. Most governments \nmake limited regular budgetary provision for unforeseen events such as disasters and health \nemergencies. National and local governments are often mandated to allocate a part of their \nbudgets for such purposes. However, these allocations are often largely limited to immediate \nhumanitarian relief costs and preliminary health response. Moreover, DMCs have typically made \nlimited use of other ex ante risk financing instruments, including insurance. In 2018, the non-life \ninsurance penetration rate in Asia is extremely low at just 1.58%\u2014only slightly above the rate in \nsub-Saharan Africa which is 1.47%. By comparison, Asia\u2019s developed countries have an average \nnon-life rate of 2.89%, similar to Western Europe\u2019s 3.02%. Low penetration rates in DMCs are \npartly a result of demand frictions such as unaffordability, liquidity constraints, lack of trust, and \nbehavioral biases. On the supply side, adverse selection and moral hazards; high transaction; \nlack of sound legal and regulatory institutions; and a lack of credible, granular data on risks limit \nuptake of disaster insurance. \n \n5.  As a result of under insurance, ex ante risk financing arrangements are inadequate when \na major disaster or pandemic strikes, and the resulting spending needs are often largely met, by \ndefault, through budget reallocations. Such reallocations can take time to approve and can knock \nprevious spending priorities and development goals off track. Ad hoc risk financing arrangements \nand  related  uncertainties  regarding  budget  availability  also  hinder  response  and  recovery \nplanning and the effective use of resources. Therefore, many governments seek to strengthen \nsovereign disaster and epidemic insurance instruments and nudge the insurance market to \ndevelop  property,  health,  and  agricultural  insurance  products.  Strong  commitment  and \ncoordination among DMCs can help expand the use of such mechanisms. \n \n6.  Key findings from disaster risk financing assessments. Strategy 2030 has identified \nthe need for DMCs to strengthen financial preparedness for disaster response, support health \ninsurance reforms, and promote regional cooperation in risk financing to mitigate cross-border \ndisaster, climate change, and infectious disease risks. Under the Operational Plan for Integrated \nRisk Management, 2014\u20132020, ADB is expanding its engagement in risk financing through \ncontingent disaster financing and actions to increase disaster insurance penetration.5 It has \nsupported assessments of the enabling environment for disaster risk financing (DRF) in Fiji, Nepal, \nPakistan, and Sri Lanka. Key findings from these assessments include: (i) national DRF strategies \nare required to help establish financial protection arrangements; (ii) DMCs need to develop shock-\nresponsive social protection systems via integration with risk transfer arrangements; (iii) risk \nfinancing arrangements must factor in better financial preparedness against health shocks; and \n(iv) regional knowledge sharing on risk financing solutions should be enhanced. \n \n7.  The assessments point to the need to strengthen fiscal resilience of DMCs by tracking \nbudget allocations and expenditure on disaster risk management (DRM) and improving the \ninstitutional framework for DRF. Such allocations may be spread across sector budgets and may \nform just one component or an indirect benefit of a wider development project. Additional issues \nsurrounding the monitoring of post-disaster spending largely reflect DMCs\u2019 overreliance on post-\ndisaster budget reallocations and poor related records. These challenges around monitoring \nbudgetary expenditure make it difficult for the federal government to (i) hold public bodies to \naccount on DRM policy and spending commitments, (ii) ensure that individual line agencies and \nlocal governments have sufficient resources to meet their DRM responsibilities, (iii) ensure a cost-\neffective balance of expenditure on disaster risk reduction and post-disaster response, and (iv) \n \n5  ADB. 2014. Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "3 \nensure that the extent and nature of public spending on DRM is appropriate relative to the scale \nand nature of disaster risks and other demands on public resources. \n \n8.  Additional lessons from the country diagnostic studies have highlighted that insurance is \nnot a stand-alone risk financing solution. Its suitability needs to be assessed based on several \ncriteria, including the frequency and severity of the types of hazards faced, the opportunity cost \nof  premium  payments,  and  the  availability  of  alternative  mechanisms  for  managing  risk. \nComprehensive DRF strategies could help governments compare the available options and use \ndifferent  risk  financing  instruments  most  effectively.  The  selection  process  should  involve \nassessing the scale of risk at each return period, determining who bears each risk, and identifying \nthe most suitable instrument for each layer of risk. A thorough risk assessment and cost\u2013benefit \nreview is also critical to matching risk financing options to risks. The selection of sovereign risk \ntransfer instruments is ultimately a political exercise that requires balancing timeliness, accuracy, \nand cost; and establishing an enabling environment for private sector participation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: enabling environment for risk financing in \nselected DMCs strengthened (footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: capacity in \nselected DMCs for developing and deploying sustainable and scalable risk financing products \nenhanced.6 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Frameworks for disaster and pandemic risk financing developed. Under \nthis output, SDCC will deliver country diagnostics assessments on disaster and pandemic risk \nfinancing to four target countries: Cambodia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and the Philippines. \nDrawing on ongoing DRF projects in the four countries, the assessments will study the enabling \nenvironment  for  disaster  and  pandemic  risk  financing  and  identify  actions  to  advance  the \navailability and uptake of risk financing solutions. The country diagnostics assessments will \nexpand the DRF diagnostics framework developed under phase 1 of the TA to include epidemics \nand pandemics. The assessments will cover government policies; the impact of shocks on \nbusinesses and livelihoods and broader economies; the availability of social protection and \ninsurance and other risk financing instruments, including gender-inclusive products; availability of \ntechnical support for facilitating insurance claims underwriting and claims administration; private \nsector credibility; and market regulation. Drawing on these assessments, the TA will support the \norganization of regional knowledge-sharing events under regional cooperation and integration \nplatforms, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Central Asian \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC),  and  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation, involving officials from finance, health, and DRM ministries. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Feasibility  studies  on  disaster  insurance  products  for  livelihood \nrestoration, homeowners, and small businesses in Nepal undertaken. The TA will support \ntwo gender-sensitive feasibility studies to inform the design of potential insurance pilots for post-\ndisaster restoration of livelihoods and small businesses in municipalities in Nepal. Municipalities \nwill be selected in consultation with the government. The first study will focus on weather index-\nbased crop insurance against loss of yield for small and marginal rice farmers who have borrowed \n \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nfrom financial institutions and will also seek to bridge gender gaps. The second will focus on the \nprovision of post-disaster assistance to homeowners and small businesses using parametric \nindex insurance products linked to social assistance schemes. Both studies will explore cost-\nsharing arrangements for insurance premiums among federal, provincial, and local governments \nand the involvement of private insurance companies. \n \n12.  Output 3: Disaster-related public expenditure and institutional review in Nepal \nundertaken. The TA will support a public expenditure and institutional review to map DRM \nresources and responsibilities in Nepal. The review will analyze federal, provincial, and local \ngovernment arrangements, and generate recommendations for each domain of government to \nadopt more effective integration of DRM in government spending. \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s value addition. In line with the country partnership strategies, the assessments in \nCambodia and the Philippines will contribute to the Public Asset Financial Protection Program \nunder the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility.7 The Philippine assessment will \ncomplement ADB\u2019s Disaster Resilience Improvement Program proposed for 2020. The Kyrgyz \nRepublic assessment will complement the Landslide Risk Management Sector Project proposed \nfor 2020 and ongoing ADB TA to design a regional disaster insurance facility for CAREC \ncountries.8 The Pakistan assessment will extend the DRF diagnostics framework developed \nunder phase 1 of the TA to cover pandemic financing and contribute to the implementation of the \nnational DRF strategy with ADB support. The Nepal assessment will complement the policy-\nbased loan program Support for Reforms to Strengthen Devolved Service Delivery proposed for \n2020. The Nepal National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority has expressed \ninterest in designing pilot projects on insurance and DRM public expenditure and institutional \nreview. The regional knowledge-sharing events will focus on financial preparedness for disasters, \nepidemics and pandemics, insurance, and capital market solutions, and regional risk financing \nframeworks. SDCC will produce knowledge products for wider dissemination of innovative ideas \nand lessons through ADB Knowledge Events. Where possible, the TA will complement and \nsupplement existing and proposed initiatives and activities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) and (ii) $500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.9 The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n15.

Recruitment will be based on the same methodology developed for selecting consultants \nduring phase 1 (footnote 1). Disaster and pandemic risk financing are highly specialized domains \nand it is challenging to find diverse skill sets within a single consulting firm. Individual consultants \nbring in-depth knowledge of the subject and extensive hands-on experience in dealing with \nbusinesses and governments in multiple geographies. Resource persons will also be engaged to \ncontribute to the delivery of regional knowledge events under the TA. ADB will engage the \nconsultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its \nassociated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.10 Output-based and/or \nlump-sum contracts will be considered for consulting services, where appropriate, with the \nconcurrence of the Procurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening the Enabling Environment for Disaster Risk Financing (Phase 2) and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.\n \n10 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nEnabling environment for risk financing in selected developing member countries strengthened (ADB \nStrategy 2030)a \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2022:     \nCapacity in  a.
