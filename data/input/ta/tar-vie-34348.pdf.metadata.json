", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Viet Nam Country Strategy and Program (CSP) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), identifies inclusive social development as one of its three strategic priorities. Improving \nand deepening human capital, especially of the poor, is identified as a major area of operation. \nDuring the Country Programming Mission in 2002, the Government of Viet Nam requested \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Strengthening  of  Preventive  Health \nServices Project1 (the Project).  A Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam from 8 to 17 January \n2003  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost \nestimates, terms of reference, and implementation arrangements of the TA.2 The Mission held \nconsultations  with  the  concerned  government  ministries,  potential  beneficiaries,  and  various \nmultilateral and bilateral organizations. The TA is included in the CSP for Viet Nam for 2003.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam has made considerable progress over the past decade in improving the health \nof its population. Many of the key health indicators are comparable to those of countries that \nhave  substantially  higher  income  level.3  Despite  these  impressive  achievements,  the \nVietnamese public health system faces the formidable challenge of dealing with a double \nburden of disease, typical of countries going through the epidemiological transition. While the \noverall prevalence of communicable diseases has decreased drastically, prevalence among \nseveral subpopulations, especially the poor and ethnic minorities, still remains stubbornly high. \nAt the same time, the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases is increasing. Faced with the \nchallenge of addressing this double burden, the country needs to (i) accelerate efforts to control \nthe incidence of communicable diseases, and protect the health of the poor and disadvantaged; \nand  (ii)  position  the  system  to  meet  the  challenges  of  ongoing  social,  demographic,  and \nepidemiological transitions. \n \n3.  A  major  challenge  for  the  Vietnamese  health  system  stems  from  the  ongoing \nepidemiological  transition,  whereby  the  pattern  of  disease  is  increasingly  dominated  by \nnoncommunicable diseases. Evidence shows that this changing pattern of disease is already \naffecting the health system in rural and poor areas. The challenges for the health system are to \nprovide the most appropriate, cost-effective care, and to diagnose the early signs of lifestyle \ndiseases including cancer and cardiovascular conditions before they evolve into life-threatening \nconditions that entail costly treatments for individuals and large expenses for the health system. \nFor instance, hypertension (or high blood pressure) accounts for about 20% of all deaths in Viet \nNam.  Recent  surveys  suggest  that  approximately  7%  of  the  adult  population  suffer  from \nhypertension.  \n \n4.  With increasing life expectancy and declining birth rates, the proportion of old-age \npopulation is rapidly increasing in Viet Nam. The aging population, and increasing trends in \nurbanization  and  unhealthy  lifestyles,  are  expected  to  further  increase  the  incidence  of \nnoncommunicable  diseases,  thereby  adding  to  the  burden  of  disease.  For  example,  the \nmortality rate due to coronary disease in Viet Nam is projected to increase by 60% from 1995 to \n2010. Deaths caused by chronic pulmonary obstructive disease could also increase due to \naging, high levels of pollution, and smoking. Cancers are expected to rapidly increase at similar \n                                                 \n1  The Project was earlier referred to as the Health Sector Development Project. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 2002. \n3  Asian  Development  Bank  and  World  Health  Organization.  2002.  Improving  Health  Status  and  Reducing \nInequalities.  ", "2 \nrates.  Health  care  for  the  elderly,  being  very  specialized  and  more  expensive,  requires \nsignificant changes in how services are provided and financed. It is unclear if the existing health \nsystem is adequately positioned to take on these challenges. \n \n5.  Rapid increase of HIV/AIDS4 infection, growth in illicit drug use, declining yet high levels \nof tobacco use, large increase in accident-related deaths, and persistent high levels of child \nmalnutrition are areas that require priority attention. In just one decade, HIV has spread to all 61 \nprovinces. There are estimated to be more than 150,000 HIV-infected persons in the country, \nwhich is expected to grow to more than 200,000 by 2005. A significant proportion of HIV \ninfection is attributable to intravenous drug use. Use of tobacco is also an area of increasing \nconcern. About 50% of males and 4% of females regularly use tobacco, which has a profound \neffect on the incidence of several diseases including lung cancer, other respiratory illnesses \n(e.g., chronic bronchitis and emphysema), and cardiovascular diseases. This will require greater \nemphasis on health education and behavior change communication.  \n \n6.  With rapid urbanization being experienced in the country, environmental health and \noccupational health are emerging as key issues. Establishing minimum standards and enforcing \nthem are essential functions of the public health system. The capacity of the Government to \nenforce minimum occupational and environmental norms is currently weak. In addition, the area \nof food hygiene and safety is emerging as a major public health challenge. The food safety \ninspection program, particularly at the provincial level, needs substantial strengthening. The \ncountry needs to develop capacity for testing exported and imported food items. This will \nbecome even more important as Viet Nam continues its efforts to more closely integrate itself \nwith the global economy.  \n \n7.  Promoting  preventive  health  generates  significant  externalities  for  the  economy. \nTraditionally, the preventive health system has been strong in Viet Nam and is responsible for \nmuch of the impressive achievement in health. Sustaining the momentum of the preventive \nhealth  system  will  require  considerable  strengthening  and  reorientation  of  these  services. \nProvincial preventive health centers need further investment through improved provision of \ndiagnostic and laboratory services, a better surveillance system, and improved personnel skills \nto meet the challenge of the epidemiological transition. The major constraints to taking on these \nfuture challenges are the lack of capacity for testing and diagnosing health problems and their \nunderlying causes, a poor surveillance and monitoring system, and inadequate skills among \npreventive health personnel.  \n \n8.  The proposed  Strengthening of Preventive Health Services Project will build on the \nexperience  of  the  ongoing  Rural  Health  Project  and  support  national  preventive  health \ninfrastructure  and  selected  programs  for  prevention  and  control  of  communicable  and \nnoncommunicable diseases. The Project will directly address the identified needs in the health \nsector. The overall goal of the Project will be to assist the Government in maintaining the pace \nof health improvements in the future, and to control the spread of emerging diseases including \nHIV/AIDS. The specific objectives of the Project are to assist the Government in: \n \n(i)  halting  by  2010  and  beginning  to  reverse  by  2015  the  spread  of  major \ncommunicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS; and \n(ii)  preparing  the  health  system  to  effectively  address  the  new  and  emerging \nchallenges,  including  those  related  to  food  safety,  occupational,  and \nenvironmental health. \n                                                 \n4  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ", "    3 \n \n9.  These objectives will be achieved through strengthening the public health infrastructure \nfor preventive health. A preliminary logical framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will assist the Ministry of Health (MOH) in undertaking the requisite background \nanalysis and preparing the documentation necessary for the Government and ADB to appraise \nand approve the proposed Project with objectives and focus as discussed in para. 8. The main \noutputs of the TA will include (i) a master plan for laboratories for preventive health in Viet Nam, \n(ii) a master plan for training of preventive health workers; (iii) a project feasibility report, and (iv) \na project implementation plan. In addition, the TA team will help MOH in preparing prefeasibility \nand feasibility studies to enable the Government to undertake its project appraisal. The likely \nsize of the Project is $75 million equivalent, including government counterpart funds.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will be implemented in four overlapping but distinct phases. The TA will be \nimplemented in a participatory manner that will closely involve community leaders, potential \nbeneficiaries, health services providers, and interested international agencies.  An initial poverty \nand social analysis is included in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The first phase will be a learning and analysis phase in which background information \nabout the Project will be collected and collated. Based on available analytical work already done \nin Viet Nam, discussions with stakeholders, field visits, and rapid surveys (as needed), the TA \nteam will produce (i) a situational analysis of the communicable diseases control programs in the \ncountry, which will summarize the organizational structures of these programs; identify gaps (if \nany) related to policies, institutional capacity, and investments; and highlight the priorities for \ninvestment and external support; and (ii) a master plan for preventive health laboratories with \nrecommendations for clear priorities for investments. \n \n13.  In the second phase, the TA team will prepare the first draft of the project proposal \nbased on the analytical work completed in the first stage and previously undertaken work. A \ndraft feasibility report for the Project will be prepared, which will inter alia include (i) details of the \nProject area with all necessary background information; (ii) the objectives, scope, rationale, and \nlogical  framework  for  the  Project;  (iii)  various  options  available  for  achieving  the  project \nobjectives and recommended option(s); (iv) details of recommended project activities,  their \ntechnical justification, and rough cost estimates; (v) targets and monitoring indicators; and (vi) \nproject management structure. The results of the second phase will be shared and discussed \nwith a wide range of stakeholders in a national workshop. Representatives from provincial \npeople\u2019s committees, provincial health departments, related departments of MOH, other involved \nministries, selected nongovernment organizations, mass movement organizations, and interested \ninternational agencies will be invited to the workshop. \n \n14.  In the third phase, the TA team will develop a more detailed feasibility report. Based on \nthe inputs from the national workshop, the feasibility study will be further refined and the \nfollowing sections will be added: (i) a detailed economic and social analysis, (ii) benefits and \nrisks associated with the Project, (iii) policy actions that are required to be taken in conjunction ", "4 \nwith the Project, and (iv) an ethnic minority development plan. As per the ADB  Operations \nManual, a  project performance management system will also be added, which extends and \nreplaces the benefit monitoring and evaluation system originally envisioned. The TA will identify \nspecific policy recommendations that should be implemented in conjunction with the Project. \nIssues related to project implementation in difficult areas will be specifically considered, and \nrecommendations provided. The final draft feasibility study will be shared with stakeholders in \nthe second national workshop. The draft will be finalized and submitted to ADB and the \nGovernment.  The  TA  team  will  also  assist  MOH  in  preparing  a  prefeasibility  study  for \nsubmission to the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). \n \n15.  In the last phase of the TA, the team will prepare a project implementation plan based on \nthe feasibility study with operational details of the Project. The plan will include a time schedule \nfor various activities, and bidding documents for all procurement to be undertaken in the first \nyear  of  the  Project.  The  team  will  also  assist  MOH  in  preparing  the  feasibility  study  for \nsubmission to MPI, and support the fact-finding and appraisal missions of ADB. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $625,000 equivalent, comprising $375,000 in \nforeign exchange and $250,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $125,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the \nJapan Special Fund financed by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nbalance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $125,000, through the provision of counterpart \nstaff, office accommodation, office support and translation services, and availability of meeting \nrooms. Tentative cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has \nbeen advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MOH will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A team of three international (16 person-\nmonths) and seven domestic (26 person-months) consultants will be recruited to provide specialist \nservices totaling 42 person-months. International consultants will provide services in (i) public \nhealth (7 person-months), (ii) laboratory sciences (6 person-months), and (iii) health economics \nand health financing (3 person-months). The domestic consultants will provide services in (i) \nepidemiology  (12  person-months),  (ii)  laboratory  equipment  (6  person-months),  (iii)  social \ndevelopment  (3  person-months),  (iv)  human  resource  development  and  training  (4  person-\nmonths); and (v) medical waste management (1 person-month). \n \n18.  The services of all the consultants will be engaged through a firm by ADB using the \nsimplified technical proposal procedure and the quality and cost-based selection method in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements on the \nrecruitment  of  domestic  consultants  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Outline  terms  of  references  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n19.  An interministerial steering committee, chaired by MOH, will be established to provide \noverall guidance to the TA and to ensure coordination with other concerned ministries. The \ncommittee  will  include  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  MPI,  Office  of  the \nGovernment, State Bank of Viet Nam, and provincial people\u2019s committees of selected provinces.  \nAt the technical working level, a TA task force will be established under the leadership of the \ndirector, Department of Planning. The task force will be composed of representatives from the ", "    5 \nDepartment  of  Preventive  Medicine,  Food  Administration,  and  other  related  departments. \nMembers of the task force will form the core of the project management unit during the ensuing \nProject. People and offices involved in project preparation will thus continue to be involved in \nproject implementation to maintain continuity. The task force will be appointed and the steering \ncommittee established before the start of the TA. \n \n20.  In addition to the workshops, regular consultations will be held among ADB, the consulting \nteam, and international agencies to present the TA findings with the aim of generating cofinancing \ninterest at the earliest stages of project processing. The TA will be implemented over 8 months \nfrom August 2003 to March 2004. The TA team leader will submit a draft inception report to ADB \nand MOH within 2 weeks from the start of the TA, an interim report 1 month after the first national \nworkshop, and a final draft report by January 2004. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance, not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the Strengthening of Preventive Health Services \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

The public health system faces challenges in protecting the health of the poor and \nin responding to the changing patterns of disease associated with ongoing social, demographic, and epidemiological \ntransitions.  The poor and disadvantaged tend to suffer from a greater burden of disease.

Poverty Analysis    Proposed Classification:  Poverty  \n     Thematic areas:  Human Development/Gender \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe goals of the Project are to improve the availability of quality health services, increase client affordability and \nutilization of health services, and strengthen the capacity of the public health system to meet the challenges of \nongoing social, demographic, and epidemiological transitions. Investments will be made in two areas: (i) \ncommunicable diseases control, including HIV/AIDS and malaria; and (ii) noncommunicable diseases control, \nincluding food safety, occupational, and environmental health. The poverty analysis will help to ensure that the \ninvestments are pro-poor whereby the poor and disadvantaged groups will benefit proportionately, and the Project will \nreduce vulnerability risks of the poor and disadvantaged groups from becoming further marginalized. \n \nThe poverty analysis should focus on the poverty impact of the proposed interventions on the poor and \ndisadvantaged. It should include the targeting of different components to the poor, and the contribution of the Project \nin reducing vulnerability of the poor and the near poor to health-related shocks. It should include an assessment that \nidentifies (i) the existing burden of disease for the poor and disadvantaged groups, (ii) their ability to pay for proposed \nservices supported by the Project, (iii) possible strategies to optimize the use of services, and (iv) the current capacity \nof the preventive health system to effectively address their health needs. The analysis should also establish cost-\nsharing mechanisms to enhance the sustainability of the preventive health system, and improve the overall equity of \nhealth financing. \n \n \nC.
