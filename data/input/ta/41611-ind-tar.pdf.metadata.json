During  discussions  for  the  country  operations  business  plan  2008\u20132010,  the \nGovernment of India (the Government) requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  power  sector  entities  in  Himachal \nPradesh. ADB conducted a fact-finding mission from 30 March 2008 to 4 April 2008 and \nreached an understanding with the government of Himachal Pradesh (GOHP) on the TA\u2019s \nobjective, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, implementing arrangements, and consultants\u2019 \nterms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Himachal Pradesh\u2019s power sector ranked seventh out of 29 in a state power sector \nperformance  rating  study  mandated  by  the  Government.2 Strengths  included  satisfactory \nprogress in distribution reforms, particularly metering and energy accounting, and achievement \nof 100% rural and consumer electrification. Himachal Pradesh is one of the few states where \nenergy  delivered  to  consumers  is  100%  metered,  and  its  distribution  system  has  97.4% \navailability, which is high. It has also achieved more than 90% metering of its distribution \ntransformers  and  feeders  up  to  33  kilovolts  (kV),  resulting  in  aggregate  technical  and \ncommercial losses of a comparatively low 16.3%.   \n \n3.  The state\u2019s power generation potential is 20,415 megawatts (MW)\u2014about 25% of India\u2019s  \ntotal hydropower potential\u2014out of which around 6,150 MW has been developed. Recognizing \nthe state\u2019s comparative advantage in hydropower generation, the main strategy of GOHP, \noutlined in its state Hydro Power Policy, 2006, is to become the country\u2019s \u201cHydro Power State\u201d \nby providing affordable, reliable power to its residents, and selling excess power to other states \nand earn revenue. GOHP has targeted its comparative advantage in hydropower with planned \ninvestments in installed capacity backed by institutional reforms and capacity development. A \nnew corporate entity, Himachal Pradesh Hydropower Company (HPHPC), has been established \nwith a mandate to develop and operate new hydropower plants in the state.  \n \n4.  As of March 2007, the state has installed capacity of 535 MW; this rises to 1,866 MW \nwith a share from the national power capacity. In 1991, Himachal Pradesh opened hydropower \ndevelopment  for  private  sector  participation.  Two  private  projects  totaling  386  MW  were \ncommissioned. Currently, the state is able to meet about 50% of its demand from its own \nresources and experiences energy shortages in the winter months. Power demand3 in the state \nis expected to increase by 11.37% from 2006 to 2012 and 6.69% from 2012 to 2017. To meet \nthis, GOHP is expanding its hydropower development plans by adding 5,744 MW capacity by \n2012. The identified hydropower sites have been allocated to state, central, and private sector \ninvestors. Central public sector utilities are expected to develop about 2,754 MW; the private \nsector  about  1,850  MW;  and  the  state  sector  1,140  MW.  An  additional  750  MW  of  mini-\nhydropower is expected to be developed privately.  \n \n5.  GOHP  requested  ADB  assistance  to  accomplish 1,140 MW  investments.  Since  the \nstate\u2019s clean energy agenda is in line with ADB\u2019s clean energy and the environment program, \nADB is preparing a multitranche financing facility (MFF) of $800 million to assist GOHP in \nselected hydropower projects totaling 856 MW. The MFF will be implemented by the new \ncorporate entity, HPHPC, which has substantial human capital in the form of senior technical \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 May 2008. \n2 State Power Sector Performance Ratings - Final Report to the Ministry of Power, Government of India, June 2006. \n3 The Central Electricity Authority periodically publishes electric power surveys which include power sector data and \nforecasts gathered from all sector agencies to be used for sector planning purposes. \n ", "2   \nstaff and is hiring financial and legal professionals to support its growing business. HPHPC\u2019s \ntechnical staff has experience in implementing investments funded by external donors but not \nthe MFF modality, so capacity building is essential for preparation of further MFF tranches.  \n \n6.  Himachal  Pradesh\u2019s  transmission  assets  consist  of  2,100  kilometers  (km)  of \ntransmission lines rated 66 KV and above and about 100 power transformers, totaling around \n2,000 megavolt-amperes of capacity. These physical interconnections of transmission network \nenable the state to exchange power with its regions, depending on the daily power supply \nbalance.  However,  with  considerable  hydropower  capacity  additions  in  various  stages  of \nplanning,  development,  and  construction,  there  will  be  significant  need  for  additional \ntransmission capacity to be able to wheel the power in the state and out of state. In the absence \nof a framework for planning, ad hoc capacity additions are made in response to the availability \nof funding. Regional long-term demand forecasting is crucial along with concept development \nfor the power system to meet prospect demand. This could be addressed by developing a \nplanning framework and power system master plan (the master plan). Himachal Pradesh State \nElectricity Board (HPSEB) does not have long-term planning capability to develop a master plan \nthat could (i) consider various generation scenarios, and (ii) design a transmission grid capable \nof supplying in-state and out-of-state consumers as efficiently as possible with an appropriate \nlevel of supply reliability. \n \n7.  The  state\u2019s  power  sector  is  regulated  by  Himachal  Pradesh  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission (HPERC). GOHP established a functioning regulatory commission in 2001, and it \nhas been issuing tariff orders since then. HPERC is mandated to take measures conducive to \nthe development and management of the electricity industry in an efficient, economic, and \ncompetitive manner. It also acts to safeguard consumer interests and improve the quality of \nservice, and holds regular review meetings to monitor compliance with the various directives. In \nits 2005\u20132006 tariff order, HPERC made efforts to reduce cross-subsidies and optimize power \npurchase costs by authorizing the procurement of power on a merit order dispatch basis. \nHPERC has developed all regulations, codes, and standards (including open access) required \nby the Electricity Act, 2003; and is developing a multiyear tariff framework. A strong regulatory \nstructure is being formed in Himachal Pradesh. However, new sector developments such as the \nestablishment  of  a  new  hydropower  company  and  planned  generation  increase  make  it \nessential to develop HPERC\u2019s capacity further.   \n \n8.  ADB will provide TA in the following areas: \n \n(i)  Component 1. This component will develop a comprehensive master plan that \naddresses the state\u2019s power sector planning issues, considering the wide range \nof supply and demand scenarios in Himachal Pradesh. The master plan will be \nlinked to the state\u2019s sector policy and will summarize a clear planning framework, \nplanning criteria, and a detailed and disaggregated demand forecast at the power \nsubstation level. The master plan will (a) provide a series of staged, least-cost, \n10-year network expansion programs matched to demand growth and under \nvarious clean energy generation scenarios; (b) run a cost and benefit analysis for \noptions with and without the clean development mechanism; and (c) identify risk \nfactors and a risk management plan for the state power system. A rolling 5-year \ncapital works plan linked to the master plan will be developed and updated \nregularly, with detailed project reports prepared for projects covered in the first  \n1\u20132 years of the capital works plan. The master plan will include a loss reduction \nframework and a staged capital works program designed to reduce technical and \nnontechnical losses along a reasonable and agreed path.  \n ", "  3\n(ii)  Component 2. This component of the TA will assist HPERC in assessing user \nrequirements, information availability for identification of functional specification \nof a regulatory management information system (RMIS). The TA will also assist \nHPERC in developing methodology to compute the cost of supply at various \nvoltage levels.  \n(iii)  Component  3. This component will provide bridge assistance to HPHPC to \nprepare periodic financing requests for further tranches of the MFF and set up a \nproject monitoring mechanism for projects financed under the facility.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact and outcome of the TA will include the following: \n \n(i)  Component 1: The outcome of this component will be a comprehensive power \nsystem master plan that will provide the blueprint for development of the power \nsector  in  Himachal  Pradesh.  The  master  plan  will  tie  together  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  expansion  to  ensure  that  all  proposed  capital \ninvestments are part of a long-term, structured plan rather than ad hoc. It will also \nensure  that  network  expansion  is  economically  efficient  and  will  provide  a \nrealistic framework for loss reduction. \n(ii)  Component 2: The outcome will be specifications for an RMIS and a reporting \nframework for the power sector entities. Using these specifications, HPERC will \nacquire an RMIS using its own resources. Assessing information requirement of \nHPERC  and  reporting  necessities  of  the  power  sector  entities  will  facilitate \npurchasing  or  developing  the  correct  RMIS,  and  ultimately  facilitate \nimplementation of the multiyear tariff structure. The RMIS will also support review \nof  performance  standards  in  the  multiyear  tariff  framework.  Developing  a \nmethodology to compute the cost of supply at various voltage levels will support \n(a) rationalization of tariff across different voltage levels, (b) rationalization of \ncross-subsidies, and (c) determination of open access surcharges. \n(iii)  Component 3: Preparation of periodic financing requests for further tranches of \nthe MFF. \n \n  1.  Outputs \n10.  Outputs for each component are as follows: \n \n(i)  Component 1: (a) A detailed long-term (10-year) demand forecast for Himachal \nPradesh at the power substation level, with demand disaggregated between \nmain consumer groups; (b) a series of realistic long-term generation capacity \nexpansion scenarios, considering prospects for in-state generation development \nas  well  as  generation  sourced  outside  the  state;  (c)  a  series  of  least-cost \ntransmission expansion plans, matched to the generation expansion scenarios \ndeveloped; (d) an assessment of the quantum and timing of generation and \ntransmission investments for each system development scenario; (e) an estimate \nof distribution investment costs to meet demand growth; (f) cost and benefit \nanalysis  for  options  with  and  without  the  clean  development  mechanism; \n(g) identification of risk factors and a risk management plan for the state power \nsystem; (h) institutional reform recommendations for HPSEB to develop capacity \nto implement the master plan and revise it as necessary; (i) a power system \n ", "4   \nanalysis software program and equipment (computers);4 and (j) a detailed 5-year \nprogram of capital works, and preparation of detailed project reports for projects \nto be covered in the first 2 years. \n(ii)  Component 2: (a) Specifications for a RMIS, (b) a reporting framework for the \npower sector entities, and (c) a cost of supply framework and model. \n(iii)  Component 3: Periodic financing requests for further tranches of the MFF. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.
