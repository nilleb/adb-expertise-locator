The recent proliferation of free trade agreements (FTAs) in Asia is placing increasing \nstrains on the region\u2019s FTA negotiations capacity and creating a demand for new technical skills \namong  government  officials  in  such  areas  as  services,  intellectual  property  rights,  and \ngovernment procurement. These capacity constraints are particularly acute in poorer countries, \nwhich also lack institutions to provide training for their officials. These issues were highlighted at \nan FTA brainstorming seminar, which was attended by eminent policy-makers and members of \nacademia in the region, in Manila in March 2006.1 Subsequently, the Association of Southeast \nAsian  Nations  (ASEAN)  requested  capacity-building  support  for  FTA  negotiations  from  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) at a Senior Economic Officials Meeting (SEOM) in Kuala \nLumpur on 24 March 2006.2 In response, ADB\u2019s Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) \nconducted a fact-finding mission to the ASEAN Secretariat to determine how ADB could support \ntrade-related capacity building in ASEAN countries.  \n \n2.  This technical assistance (TA) is designed to strengthen the technical and analytical \nskills  of  officials  from  selected  Asian  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  in  designing, \nnegotiating, and implementing effective FTAs. The design and monitoring framework is attached \nas Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Many developing countries do not have sufficient trade-related capacity to benefit from \nthe opportunities provided by the open markets of multilateral trading systems. As a result, at \nthe global level, trade-related capacity building is at the heart of the deliberations of a new round \nof multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO). \nThe Doha Declaration issued by the WTO ministers in November 2001 identified trade-related \ncapacity building as a critical element of the development dimension of the multilateral trading \nsystem. Subsequently, the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, China in December 2005 \ncalled for a workable aid-for-trade package to respond to trade-related capacity building needs \nof  developing  countries.  ADB  and  other  regional  development  banks  have  committed \nthemselves to supporting this initiative as it can provide significant opportunities for economic \ndevelopment and poverty reduction4 and increase participation by developing countries in world \ntrade, thereby strengthening the multilateral trading system.  \n4.  Since 2000, new trade and investment frameworks have been rapidly emerging in Asia. \nMany economies have been initiating and participating in negotiations on increasing numbers of \nbilateral or regional FTAs. The coverage, rules, and standards in several of these FTAs overlap. \nADB estimates that there are currently over 175 FTAs5 that either have been signed or are \nunder negotiation in Asia. East Asian economies have been involved in 95 of these and have \nbeen a major driver of FTAs in the region.  \n                                                 \n1  Participants at the brainstorming seminar on free trade agreements: \u201cIssues and Challenges in Designing Free \nTrade Agreements in Asia\u201d, which was organized by the Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI), included \nHE Ms. Mari Elka Pangestu, Trade Minister of Indonesia, and Mr. Narongchai Akarasanee, Executive Chairman, \nExport-Import Bank of Thailand (former Trade Minister of Thailand). \n2  The Second Meeting of ASEAN Senior Economic Officials was attended by senior ASEAN economic officials at the \ndirector-general level.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities on 13 July 2006. \n4  See press release of Inter-American Development Bank on 8 June at  \nhttp://www.iadb.org/NEWS/articledetail.cfm?font=3&artid=3122&language=English \n5  http://aric.adb.org/regionalcooperation/index.asp accessed June 2006     ", "2 \n \n5.  The growing number of FTAs in Asia and the Pacific is in part a response to the \nuncertain progress of multilateral trade liberalization under the auspices of WTO. There is also a \nprecautionary motive behind them as countries seek to avoid being placed at a competitive \ndisadvantage by the other regional trading arrangements that are taking shape in the rest of the \nworld. Another factor behind the spread of FTAs is that many economies that are geographically \nclose to each other have already established strong trade and investment relationships and now \nwish  to  deepen  their  economic  cooperation.  For  example,  ASEAN  has  established  closer \neconomic partnerships with the \u201c+3\u201d countries (the PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea) and \nother trading partners (Australia, New Zealand, and India). The outcome of these agreements \nhas been the establishment of various FTAs between ASEAN and these countries.6  \n \n6.  There are positive and negative implications of the spread of FTAs in Asia. On the \npositive side, the proliferation of FTAs can help countries to pursue their dynamic comparative \nadvantage and allocate resources efficiently. Against a backdrop of slow progress in global \ntrade negotiations, FTAs can promote continuing liberalization, induce domestic and structural \nreforms  in  the  countries  concerned,  and  widen  market  access  across  the  region.  Trade \narrangements with dynamic, competitive partners can also encourage the spread of efficient \nproduction practices.  \n \n7.  However, the demands of negotiating many trade agreements place increasing strains \non scarce trade-negotiation resources of many countries, especially given the expanding scope, \ncontent, and increasing complexity of recently negotiated FTAs in the region. These capacity \nconstraints are particularly acute in DMCs that also lack institutions to support capacity building \nfor their officials. These countries may not be well equipped to manage the analytical and \ntechnical aspects involved in designing, negotiating, and implementing effective FTAs. This is \nparticularly the case in DMCs that need to simultaneously pursue significant domestic structural \nreforms, thereby introducing greater openness and increasing domestic competition.   \n \n8.  The recent proliferation of FTAs also implies that they are fast becoming a trade policy \ninstrument  of  choice  in  many  DMCs.  Capacity  building  on  FTA  design,  negotiations,  and \nimplementation for DMCs has thus become increasingly important. However, the 2005 Joint \nWTO/OECD Report on Trade-Related Technical Assistance and Capacity Building notes that \ninternational  support  for  trade  capacity  building  declined  from  $204  million  in  2002  to \n$118 million in 2004. \n \n9.  ADB is well placed to strengthen the FTA negotiation capacities of DMCs in Asia. ADB \nhas a track record in supporting trade facilitation in Asia and the Pacific through its support for \nregional and subregional cooperation programs such as the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \nProgram and the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program. ADB has \nalso supported regional capacity-building programs for trade facilitation in Asia, such as a High-\nLevel Meeting on the WTO Trading System and training courses on trade facilitation, the WTO \nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and the WTO \n                                                 \n6  To date, ASEAN has signed framework agreements on comprehensive economic partnerships with the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China [PRC], India, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. The negotiations on FTAs, which have already \nstarted with these countries, cover trade in goods, services, and investment. The basis for FTA negotiations \nbetween ASEAN and Australia and New Zealand is the Joint Declaration of the Leaders at the ASEAN-Australia \nand New Zealand Commemorative Summit, which was signed in November 2004. The Trade in Goods Agreement \nwith the PRC was signed in November 2004 and its implementation began in July 2005. Other agreements are \nunder negotiation with a targeted completion year of 2007. ", "  3   \nCustoms Valuation Agreement in 2002;7 a high-level meeting on key WTO issues and training \ncourses on anti-dumping activities, rules of origin, and investment in 2003;8 and a high-level \nmeeting  on  key  WTO  issues  and  two  training  courses  on  accession  and  WTO  dispute \nsettlement mechanisms in 2004.9    \n \n10.  In line with ADB\u2019s mandate to play a proactive role in facilitating and promoting regional \ncooperation and integration in the Asia and Pacific region, ADB should help to build up capacity \nof selected Asian DMCs in designing, negotiating, and implementing FTAs. This would also be a \ncontribution by ADB to the Aid-for-Trade program of WTO. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The objective is to strengthen the technical and analytical skills of officials from selected \nAsian DMCs in designing, negotiating, and implementing effective FTAs. The intended impact is \nthe development of effective FTAs. The expected outcome is improved technical and analytical \ncapability of Asian DMCs\u2019 officials in FTAs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA includes a high level seminar for senior officials and three training courses for \nmiddle level officials to be jointly conducted by ADB in collaboration with leading international \nexperts on FTA negotiations. The training courses target middle-level and junior officials at \nvarious concerned ministries of selected Asian DMCs who are responsible for coordinating FTA \ndesign, negotiation, and implementation. Participation would include a mix of officials mainly \nfrom ASEAN countries (in response to the specific request of the ASEAN SEOM) and other \nAsian DMCs, as appropriate.  \n \n13.  The seminar would enable senior officials to better understand complex trade, economic, \nlegal, institutional, and other policy issues relating to FTAs. This would strengthen their strategic \nand managerial skills in designing, negotiating, and implementing FTAs. \n \n14.  The tentative outline of each training course is made up of three main sections. The \nintroductory section will provide the participants with some important background concepts and \ntrends. It will cover (i) international trade theory and the economics of FTAs (including trends in \nthe Americas and Europe), political and economic driving forces of Asian FTAs, the main \nfeatures of Asian FTAs, and the case for an emerging Asia-wide FTA; (ii) the concepts of \nbusiness  competitiveness,  national  economic  performance,  and  strengths,  weaknesses, \nopportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to analyze competitiveness; and (iii) how to use \nSWOT analysis to analyze an economy\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, trade competitiveness, \nand policies on trade in goods, services, and investment. \n \n15.  The second section will focus on designing effective FTAs (i.e., FTAs that are in line with \nWTO provisions). The section will cover the following: (i) general principles in designing an  \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2002.

The third section, which is the main focus of the training, will concentrate on strategizing \nFTA negotiations and implementations. This will include: (i) country preparation for entering into \nan  FTA,  such  as  choice  of  FTA  partner,  type  of  FTA  or  economic  accord,  distinguishing \nbetween short-term structural adjustment costs and static and dynamic gains, and identifying \nnecessary domestic changes in legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks, and economic \nreforms; (ii) issues related to the Harmonized Rules of Origin; (iii) trade facilitation measures \n(e.g., transportation, logistics, communication infrastructure, customs clearance and processing); \nand  (iv)  emerging  problems  in  implementing  FTAs  (e.g., adaptation  of  sanitary  and \nphytosanitary measures, enforcement of intellectual property rights, implementation of rules of \norigin, dispute settlement, role of private sector, and interagency coordination). \n \n17.  The courses will involve a mix of formal presentations, seminars, case studies, group \nwork, video conferencing with experienced trade negotiators, a panel discussion on regional \nFTAs, and simulation exercises. Course flexibility will allow training programs to be tailored to \nsuit the different development stages and degrees of economic openness in selected Asian \nDMCs.  Training  materials  can  subsequently  be  duplicated  for  other  subregional  training \nprograms  on  trade  issues,  such  as  the  regional  TA  for  Support  to  Trade  Facilitation  and \nCapacity Building in GMS.10\n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000, which will be financed by the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund and administered by ADB. \nThe budget will cover travel and per diem for senior and mid-level officials of selected Asian \nDMCs, and remuneration for resource persons, international and national consultants, other \ncosts related to the organization of the high-level seminar and training courses, and other \nmiscellaneous  costs.  A  detailed  cost  breakdown  and  the  proposed  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n19.  The regional TA is expected to begin in September 2006 and to be completed in October \n2008. ADB will be the Executing Agency. OREI will implement the TA, in collaboration with \nEconomics and Research Department, and other ADB departments and offices.  \n \n20.  Each training course for mid-level officials will run for two weeks. The courses are \ntargeted  at  officials  actively  involved  in  designing,  negotiating,  and  coordinating  the \nimplementation of FTAs (e.g., officials from ministries of trade, finance, customs, and foreign \naffairs). The participants will have the following minimum qualifications: (i) a bachelor\u2019s degree \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2006.

The TA will require approximately 4 person-months of international consulting services \nand 2 person-months of national consulting services. Recruitment will follow the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. The scope of work and outline terms of reference for the consultants \nare in Appendix 3.   \n \n22.  International consulting services will be utilized to support the organization of the high-\nlevel seminar and preparation of the seminar report. The consultant(s) will have expertise in \ninternational  trade  policies,  regional  economic  cooperation,  and  trade  negotiations,  and \nextensive knowledge on the bilateral or subregional FTAs in Asia.   \n \n23.  Two international consultants will be engaged on an individual basis for the training \ncourses. The consultants will prepare and facilitate training courses on designing, negotiating, \nand implementing FTAs targeted for mid-level officials in selected Asian DMCs. One subject \nspecialist consultant from WTO will be invited to deliver lectures on selected technical topics \nduring  the  training  courses.  A  national  consultant  will  also  be  involved  to  support  the \norganization of the training courses.   \n \n24.  The first training course is tentatively scheduled for 16\u201327 October 2006. The second \nwill  be  held  in  October  2007,  and  the  third  in  2008.  The  high-level  seminar  is  tentatively \nscheduled for March 2007.  \n \nIV.  PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund  for  Capacity  Building  for  Designing,  Negotiating,  and  Implementing  Free  Trade \nAgreements (FTAs) in Selected Asian Developing Member Countries, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "6      Appendix 1    \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData  \nDesign  Performance   Assumptions \nSources/Reporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \n       \nImpact   \u2022  FTAs consistent with WTO  \u2022  Reports of selected  \u2022  Macroecomomic \n  rules  Asian DMCs  stability \nEffective FTAs  \u2022  Broad stakeholder  \u2022  Primary data from  \u2022  Commitment of \n   participation  the private sector  governments of \n    \u2022  Strong interest of business  and government  selected Asian \n  community in FTAs  officials  DMCs \n\u2022  Increased market access for   \nparticipating countries   \n \n        \nOutcome   \u2022  Better understanding of  \u2022  Review and  \u2022  Commitment of \n  international trade theory and  assessment by  governments of \nImproved analytical  the economics of FTAs  independent  selected Asian \nand technical skills of  \u2022  Improved skills in applying  institutions such as  DMCs \nofficials in selected  SWOT analysis to analyze  the informal  \u2022  International \nAsian DMCs involved  competitiveness   advisory group or  consultants and \nin designing,  \u2022  Better understanding of  the ASEAN  resource \nnegotiating, and  general principles in designing  Secretariat  and the  persons are \nimplementing FTAs   effective FTAs  SAARC Secretariat  available \n    \u2022  Increased knowledge on how  \u2022  Evaluation by  \u2022  Invited officials \n  to manage FTA stakeholders\u2019  Operations  are available \n  divergent expectations and  Evaluation   \n  concerns and how to engage  Department of ADB    \nthe business community while  \u2022  Feedback from    \nfactoring in their aspirations  participants   \nand concerns    \n\u2022  Improved understanding on   \nquantitative estimates of    \nmacro-effects of FTAs: ABCs   \nof modeling techniques and    \ncaveats and sample results of   \nCGE modeling   \n\u2022  Better knowledge on how to   \nstrategize and implement FTA   \nnegotiations   \n \n \n       \nOutputs  \u2022  High-quality presentation  \u2022  Progress reports by  \u2022  Inputs of \n1.
