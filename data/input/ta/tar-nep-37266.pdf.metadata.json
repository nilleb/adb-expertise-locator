The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) will prepare a transport connectivity \nsector project to improve feeder road connectivity from the strategic road network (SRN)  to \nremote areas. The TA is included in the 2004\u20132006 Country Strategy Program (CSP) Update \nfor  Nepal.1    A  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Nepal  from  3-9  March  2004  and  reached  an \nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost and financing arrangements, \nand the terms of reference for the TA. The TA framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The transportation system in Nepal depends heavily on the road network. A key part of \nthe network is the 4,740 kilometers (km) of the SRN formed by the national highways and \nfeeder roads, which constitutes 36% of the total road network. The national highways consist of \nthe east-west highway, which acts as a backbone running the length of the country in the terai,2\n \nand north-south highways linking major towns that serve a large portion of the population.  \n \n3.  Although investments for rehabilitating and improving the national highways have been \nconsiderable, the feeder and access roads connecting the district headquarters to the SRN \nneed be improved to provide the people with access to social services, trade, and employment \nopportunities. The feeder roads are major links to national highways and provide access to the \ndistrict headquarters and places of national importance such as tourism areas, industry, power \ngeneration, and pilgrimage sites. The Rural Infrastructure Development Project of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) comprises the construction and rehabilitation of 250 km of village \nroads in three districts.3 \n \n4.  The Government's Tenth Plan (FY2002-FY2007) considers poor transport connectivity to \nthe rural areas as a key constraint to economic growth in Nepal. The Plan has identified \nintegrated transport infrastructure development, linked to balanced regional development, as a \npowerful instrument of poverty reduction, given the close nexus between poverty and excluded \ndevelopment.  The  Plan  has  identified  specific  measures  to  build  the  capacities  of  the \nDepartment of Roads (DOR) and the private sector.4 The Plan\u2019s strategy and programs are fully \nin line with the provisions of the National Transport Policy.5 A 20-year road master plan has \nbeen prepared by DOR, and DOR is in the process of obtaining Government approval for it. The \nMinistry of Local Development prepared a draft National Policy for Local Infrastructure in \nFebruary 2004 and is in the process of obtaining Government approval for it. \n \n5.  The Plan identifies tourism as an important instrument of poverty reduction by virtue of \nits  potential  for  realizing  multiple  objectives.  Tourism  provides  additional  income  and \nemployment opportunities in both urban and rural areas, particularly in the hills and mountain \nareas. It is important to strengthen the SRN, particularly the feeder roads, which can open up \nnew areas for rural tourism.   \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 March 2004.  \n2 Nepal is divided into three geographic regions: the terai (flat plains), middle hills, and mountains. \n3 ADB.1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for Rural Infrastructure Development Project Manila (For $12.2 million, approved on 27 June \n1996. The project is being implemented. A follow-on Decentralized Rural Infrastructure Livelihoods Project under \npreparation is expected to construct another 450 km of district roads).  \n4 The Government has enacted legislation for implementing build-operate-transfer (BOT) and build-own-operate-\ntransfer (BOOT) policies. The Road Fund Board was established in January 2004 providing a framework for \nimproved road maintenance that will be operational and financed by a road levy. ADB has been continuously \nsupporting the operation of the road fund.  \n5 The National Transport Policy approved by the Cabinet in 2001 includes the establishment of a National \nTransportation Board, under which the roles of the departments of transport management and roads will be \nintegrated. ", " 2\n \n \n \n6.  The  development  of  Nepal's  main  roads  has  depended  on  substantial  foreign \nassistance. Typically, 50-70% of the road budget has come from foreign loans and grants. \nADB's strategic objectives in the transport sector in Nepal6 are to (i) continue to improve the \nexisting core network, (ii) ensure adequate funding for operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nexisting transport facilities, (iii) support subregional linkages, (iv) strengthen institutions, and (v) \npromote private sector participation. ADB prepared a transport sector strategy for Nepal in \n2002,7 and since 1983, has provided seven loans totaling $198.4 million8 for the road sector. \nADB and the Government concur that to further improve the overall developmental impact of \nthese investments, a medium-term program for improving and maintaining feeder and access \nroads is needed. It is important to coordinate and improve synergy among ongoing and newly \nprepared externally funded projects, especially for institutional strengthening and development. \n \n7.  Overall ADB's operations in the transport sector in Nepal have been rated successful.9 \nThe lessons learned highlight the importance of providing transport connectivity to remote areas \nand increasing the involvement of the local contracting industry, for greater economic and social \ndevelopment. The lessons also suggest insulating projects from implementation delays due to \npolitical changes and adverse macroeconomic conditions, as well as ensuring adequate funding \nfor sustainable O&M. In this regard, all civil works contracts including new road constructions \nfinanced under ADB\u2019s assistance will include maintenance for at least the first 5 years, to be \nfunded by the Government's counterpart contribution.  \n \n8.  Nepal is participating in dialogues on multimodal transport and communication through \nthe  ADB-assisted  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  comprising \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. Specifically, Nepal chairs the Transport Working Group \nand is assisting in the Subregional Corridor Operational Efficiency Study10 that will assess the \noperational efficiency of selected subregional corridors connecting these countries.  Nepal is \nalso  chair-country  of  the  SASEC  Tourism  Working  Group.  To  enhance  the  development \nobjectives of the subregional cooperation, the transport links to India and Bangladesh need to \nbe improved. \n \n9.  The ongoing conflict that has brought to light a mosaic deep-seated divisions within \nsociety  has  also  become  a  serious  constraint  to  the  implementation  of  infrastructure \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2003.

The PPTA is under implementation and the loan will be processed in 2004. ", "  3\ndevelopment projects in Nepal.11 Subject to the improved security situation, the 2004-2006 CSP \nUpdate supports the Government to prioritize reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure \nthat delivers greater benefits to the disadvantaged groups in the conflict-affected areas.12 \nConnectivity through feeder and access roads is expected to promote greater local involvement \nin the development process and will improve access to resources. With parallel efforts that aim \nat  more  inclusiveness  and  accountability  in  the  delivery  of  basic  social  services  and \nincorporating appropriate social and environmental safeguards, the overall economic impacts of \nfeeder and access roads can be significant. \n \n10.   With  ADB  assistance  under  the  Road  Network  Development  Project  (footnote  8), \nmeasures to improve road safety have been undertaken, consistent with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nRoad Safety.13 Nevertheless, road safety in Nepal is only slowly being accorded importance. \nThere  is  a  need  to  improve  the  enforcement  of  road  safety  measures  relating  to  axle \noverloading, and overspeeding. Transport connectivity through feeder and access roads is \nexpected to increase vehicle ownership and travel by villagers as well as their exposure to risk \nof road crashes and injuries. A community-oriented road safety program will be needed to \nmitigate the risk of road crashes for road users living near the SRN. \n \n11.  Traffic volumes on the majority of the feeder and access roads average less than 500 \nmotorized vehicles per day. Evidence in other developing member countries (DMCs) shows that \nin addition to benefits from savings in vehicle operating costs to normal traffic, connectivity to \nremote areas offers economic benefits through traffic generated and induced by feeder roads, \nand the growth in local economic development.14 There is a need to estimate these benefits \nusing verifiable indicators and consider what additional complementary infrastructure is required \nto make the investment in feeder and access roads projects economically justifiable.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The overall goal of the transport connectivity sector project is to improve feeder road \nconnectivity from the SRN to rural areas, and increase the capacity and efficiency of the road \nnetwork in the country. The project goals are fully consistent with the priorities in the current \nCSP Update as well as the CSP under preparation, which concur that efficient road transport \nand improved connectivity to rural areas are key to poverty reduction. The main outputs of the \nTA will be (i) a medium-term (10 years) transport connectivity program (the Medium-Term \nProgram), consistent with the 20-year master plan (para. 4), with a time-bound action plan for \nachieving  the  overall  sector  objectives;  and  (ii)  a  road  investment  sector  project  that  is \ngeographically  focused,  economically  viable,  technically  feasible,  and  socially  and \nenvironmentally sound.  \n \n13.  The TA will also recommend steps to strengthen (i) the Government's long-term capacity \nto manage and operate the road network as a safe and efficient mode of transport, (ii) ensure \nsustainable funding for O&M of road assets, and (iii) strengthen local contractors\u2019 capability to \nimprove and maintain the roads. A sustainable mechanism will also be proposed to give DOR \nan in-house means of financing feasibility studies. The project logical framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \n                                                 \n11 As part of ADB's new CSP 2005-2009, a conflict assessment report was prepared. The draft will be finalized in \nJune 2004. \n12 ADB is currently preparing the 2005-2009 CSP. The new CSP is scheduled for finalization in 2004.  \n13 ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n14 Generated traffic is traffic that did not use the road before improvement but will be attracted to use the roads after \nimprovement due to reduced travel cost or travel time. Induced traffic is additional traffic caused by the growth in \nlocal economic development because of road improvement. ", " 4\n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will review and analyze transport sector performance, key problems relating to \nconnectivity to remote areas, and opportunities for local economic and social development. \nBased on the review, the TA will propose the Medium-Term Program to resolve key problems \n(paras.  2-11),  including  financing  strategies  for  construction,  rehabilitation,  and  proper \nmaintenance; and propose a pragmatic and achievable medium-term action plan to implement \nthe  Medium-Term  Program.  The  Program  will  be  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Transport  Sector \nStrategy (footnote 7) and incorporate lessons from previous ADB-assisted projects and projects \nfunded by other agencies. The TA will assess the existing performance of the Road Fund Board \nand identify realistic mechanisms to progressively increase revenues for the fund to eventually \nbe sufficient to finance 100% road maintenance works. In addition, the TA will confirm that DOR \nhas adequate institutional and organizational capacity to prepare and implement a sector \nproject, consistent with ADB\u2019s policy for sector lending.15  \n \n15.   The TA will prepare a feasibility study for a sector investment project to implement the \nfirst part of the action plan for the  Medium-term Program, and other priority road sections, \nincluding  a  segment  along  the  north-south  transport  corridor  identified  in  the  Subregional \nTransport Facilitation Project, in consultation with other development partners.16  A list of \ncandidate feeder roads is in Supplementary Appendix 1. The project will have a geographical \nfocus and take into account the following: (i) constraints from the conflict as well as the need for \nrehabilitation and reconstruction due to the conflict; (ii) local development in other sectors to \nmaximize the overall developmental impact of connectivity; (iii) proper engineering alternatives \nthat take into account environmental concerns in road construction, including minimal use of \nexplosives and bulldozing on the mountain slopes, and adopting bio-engineering for slope \nprotection; (iv) alternatives to improving transport to remote areas; and (v) negative affects of \nissues in increased access, including increases in illegal logging, trafficking of women; and \npollution and road safety issues. \n \n16.  Baseline data for the current situation will be created for a set of objectively verifiable \nindicators on connectivity and regional economic activity, in accordance with the latest ADB \nrequirements,  guidelines,  and  handbooks  for  project  performance  management.  The  TA \nconsultants  will  forecast  the  20-year  normal,  generated,  and  induced  traffic.  Economic \nevaluation will be carried out following ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, \ntaking into account the mountainous conditions of Nepal and its low traffic volumes, especially in \nthe remote areas. In selecting the candidate roads, consideration will be given to the distribution \nof net benefits to the poor through connectivity to market, health, education, and other essential \nservices, and improved road safety. \n \n17.  Environmental assessment will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy, the Operations Manual F1/BP and F1/OP (2003), Environmental Guidelines for Selected \nInfrastructure Projects, and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (ADB\u2019s Policies, Procedures \nand Guidelines) and the Government\u2019s guidelines and procedures. Social analysis will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB's Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis. The summary \ninitial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n15 The Government has satisfactorily met the following eligibility criteria as per ADB's policy for a sector type loan: (i) \nthere is a 20-year master plan to meet the priority development needs of the sector, (ii) DOR has the institutional \ncapacity to implement the plan, and (iii) the policies applicable to the sector are appropriate. \n16 Among other priority sections in the strategic network to be identified by the Government, the feasibility study will \nalso update feasibility studies prepared under other financing assistance, such as the tunnel road  and railway \nbetween Kathmandu and Hetauda, upgrading of Kathmandu \u2013 Pokhara (World Bank). ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA total cost is estimated at $720,000 equivalent, comprising $397,000 in foreign \nexchange and $323,000 equivalent in local currency. It is proposed that ADB contribute up to \n$600,000, covering all the foreign exchange cost and $203,000 equivalent of local the currency \ncost. The ADB portion of the TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide $120,000 equivalent in local \ncurrency, to finance office space, local transport, as well as counterpart and support staff. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that \nADB's funding for the TA does not automatically commit ADB to finance the ensuing investment \nproject. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) will be the Executing Agency for \nthe TA. The Implementing Agency will be DOR. During the formulation and implementation of \nthe TA, ADB\u2019s Nepal Resident Mission will be actively involved, especially in addressing ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard policies relating to social and environmental concern.   \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 9 months, beginning in October 2004 and ending in \nJuly 2005. A multidisciplinary team of consultants will provide about 16 person-months of \ninternational and 40 person-months of domestic inputs. The consultants will have expertise in (i) \ninstitutional and private sector development, (ii) regional transportation planning and transport \neconomics, (iii) road engineering, (iv) road safety, (v) the environment, (vi) resettlement, and \n(vii) social development. All consultants will be selected and recruited using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Simplified \ntechnical proposals will be requested from the short-listed consultants. Terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 4. The consultants will be a firm of international consultants in \nassociation with domestic consultants. Individual international and domestic consultants will also \nbe engaged for any required tasks, independently or in association with the consulting firm. This \nflexible consultant recruitment arrangement reflects the participatory approach envisaged in the \nTA.  \n \n21.  The consultants will submit an inception report no later than 3 weeks after starting their \nservices, focusing on the work program and feeder roads selection. An interim report will be \nsubmitted 4 months after TA inception, and a draft final report will be submitted 8 months after \ntheir services begin. A tripartite meeting of the Government, consultants, and ADB to be held in \nKathmandu and chaired by MPPW will review the draft final report. Within 3 weeks after the \nmeeting, the consultants will submit a final report, in a format acceptable to ADB, incorporating \nall comments received on the draft final report from the Government and ADB. Stakeholders\u2019 \nworkshops  involving  all  stakeholders\u2014central  agencies,  district  development  committees, \nprivate  sector  representatives,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  other  development \npartners\u2014will  be  conducted  on  the  medium-term  transport  connectivity  program  and  the \ninvestment project within a month after the interim report and before the tripartite meeting. \nSpecifically, the TA will involve the relevant development partners during project formulation, \nand seek cofinancing to implement the program and the investment project. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to the Government \nof Nepal to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund (JSF), funded by the \nGovernment of Japan, for preparing  the Transport Connectivity Sector Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.

The terms of reference \n(TOR) for the consultants include but are not limited to the following; \n \nA.  Transport Connectivity Program  \n \n3.  Specific tasks related to the program are as follows: \n(i)  Review DOR\u2019s transport sector strategy, the Government's Tenth Plan, 20-year \ntransport master plan, previous ol an of Asian Development Bank (ADB), TA \ndocuments, and evaluation studies, and relevant documents from other external \nagencies.1  Review  and  analyze  sector  performance,  key  problems,  and \ndevelopment challenges; and present cause-effect tree analysis. \n \n(ii)  Identify key problems such as poverty, access to services, markets, tourism \npotential, etc, facing the area where the subprojects are proposed. Propose \nalternative  options  to  resolve  key  problems,  as  well  as  those  relating  to \nconstruction and rehabilitation.  The public expenditure review should not be \nlimited to operation and maintenance (O&M) funding; but rather, it should be \ngeneral review that shows the limits of government investment in the sector. \nPrepare a pragmatic and achievable medium-term program and action plan to \nimplement the strategies, including establishing benchmark indicators, monitoring \nsystem, and resources required to implement the action plan. \n \n(iii)  Using a regional planning and a programmatic approach, formulate a series of \ninvestment  projects  and  starting  points  for  institutional  reform  and  capacity \nbuilding before initiating the projects. Each project will have a geographical focus \nand take into account the following: (a) constraints from the conflict as well as \n                                                 \n1 Refer to footnotes 8 and 9 of the main paper. Under World Bank assistance, the Department of Roads (DOR) also \nprepared a 10-year Priority Investment Plan (PIP) in 1997. The Plan includes strategic road network (national \nhighway and feeder roads) and rural transport components (district roads, main trails, suspension bridges, and \ndomestic aviation). The World Bank is assisting DOR to update this PIP. The consultants will avoid duplicating \nthese activities.
