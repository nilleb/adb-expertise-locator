INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster will support the \nmandate of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to promote regional cooperation and integration \n(RCI) by strengthening the quality and impact of ADB\u2019s RCI knowledge products, particularly the \nAsian Economic Integration Report (AEIR), and RCI databases. The publications and databases \ncould help provide research and data support for ADB Management participating in regional and \nglobal policy forums; deliver an information service for external clients in policy, research, and \ndevelopment finance; and support ADB\u2019s knowledge and operational work in RCI. \n \n2.  The TA is part of the priority TA program of ADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department (ERCD) and was endorsed as corporate TA in December 2017.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Regional integration continues to deepen in Asia and the Pacific. Intraregional trade \nremains high at 57.8% of the region\u2019s total trade in 2017, while the intraregional share for foreign \ndirect investment reached 50.2%.2 Intraregional financial links are increasing, even though the \nregion  remains  more  globally  connected.  Free  trade  agreements  (FTAs)  involving  Asian \neconomies continue to proliferate with the number of concluded FTAs rising from 45 in 2000 to \n167 as of August 2018.3 The Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership was \nsigned  by  its  11  member  countries  in  March  2018,  and  negotiations  for  the  Regional \nComprehensive Economic Partnership were continuing as of November 2018. \n \n4.  However, regional cooperation efforts are likely to become more challenging because the \nremaining areas of RCI are much more complex. Trade tariffs have come down but other border \nbarriers\u2014such as nontariff measures, and border administration and clearance procedures\u2014will \nbe harder to tackle. Many Asian economies still face behind-the-border constraints related to lack \nof adequate logistics, infrastructure, and institutions. Asia and the Pacific also needs to deal with \nthe cross-border issues of labor mobility and financial integration as well as crimes, diseases, \nclimate change, and disasters. \n \n5.  These emerging challenges coupled with the rapidly changing economic environment \nrequire policy makers to monitor regional economic issues and forge national and regional policy \nresponses. Regional and global forums\u2014such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); ASEAN, Japan, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3); and the Asia\u2013Europe Meeting\u2014aim to discuss \nthese policy measures to maximize mutual benefits through concerted actions and cooperation. \nAs required by these policy dialogues, in-depth and evidence-based analyses on how regional \nintegration is progressing are needed. The following is also needed: exploring how regional \ncooperation can help promote inclusive and sustainable growth, supplementing national policies, \nstrengthening regional financial safety nets, and buttressing social and environmental protection. \nHowever, incentives for investing in RCI-related research and knowledge products in countries \nremain  low  because  of  externalities  and  the  public  good  nature  of  RCI-related  issues. \nUnderstanding and addressing the complex RCI issues in the region also require a high level of \ntechnical expertise as well as regional and country-specific knowledge. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 September 2018. \n2  Data based on ADB\u2019s Asian Economic Integration Report database. It covers the 48 regional members of ADB (45 \ndeveloping economies plus Australia, Japan, and New Zealand). \n3  ADB. Asia Regional Integration Center FTA database. https://aric.adb.org/database/fta (accessed 30 August 2018). \n ", "2   \n6.  ADB has the mandate and expertise to produce RCI-related knowledge products. Under \nStrategy 2030, ADB\u2019s new long-term corporate strategy, RCI is recognized as an operational \npriority.4 Strategy 2030 also underscores the value of ADB\u2019s knowledge and research in raising \nthe understanding of critical issues for action and contributing to global and regional forums by \noffering regional perspectives. ADB has also played an important role in the evolution of regional \nand subregional RCI initiatives.5 ADB will expand its RCI portfolio in line with the target to make \nRCI lending 30% of ADB\u2019s overall operations under Strategy 2020.6  The Operational Plan for RCI \n(2016\u20132020) recognizes that ADB\u2019s RCI knowledge products should support ADB\u2019s operational \ndepartments to enhance the quality of its RCI portfolio growth.7 \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n7.  Experience with the implementation of previous TA projects suggests that the research \nproduction process should allow for enough time and effort for in-depth analyses and rigorous \npeer reviews. To work toward this, the TA cluster will adopt the 2-year rolling research cycle in \nline with that of ADB\u2019s Asian Development Outlook. The TA cluster approach is more appropriate \nthan a stand-alone TA because the AEIR and the TA cluster\u2019s other knowledge products will \nevolve, building on the research conducted and the data compiled during prior subprojects. It will \nalso ensure that the 2-year rolling research work is continuously supported through the timely \nengagement of experts and other activities. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n8.  The  TA  cluster  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  increased  awareness  and \nunderstanding of RCI-related issues and policy options among ADB developing member countries \nto leverage RCI for inclusive and sustainable growth in Asia and the Pacific. The TA cluster will \nhave the following outcome: new RCI knowledge products and data shared in various regional \nforums and referenced by policy makers, researchers, practitioners, the media, and the public.8  \n \n9.  Output 1: regional cooperation and integration-related reports and publications are \ncreated and disseminated. Three kinds of RCI-related knowledge products will be produced. \nFirst, the annual AEIR will feature thematic chapters on challenges and issues related to RCI in \naddition to providing updates on RCI progress in trade and the global value chain, foreign direct \ninvestment,  financial  integration,  movement  of  people,  and  subregional  RCI  initiatives. 9 \nBackground research papers will be commissioned on topical issues to provide solid empirical \nand analytical foundations for the AEIR and other reports. These papers will also be considered \nfor publication as separate policy briefs and/or working papers. Second, the TA cluster will \nproduce reports on the regional economic outlook and risks and RCI progress for the semiannual \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n5  ADB\u2019s pioneering RCI platform was the Greater Mekong Subregion established in 1992. The pragmatic nature of the \nGreater Mekong Subregion, with ADB as its secretariat, proved highly successful. ADB subsequently replicated this \nmodel in Central Asia through the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program and in South Asia through \nthe South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program. \n6  ADB. 2008.

Manila.  \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  The AEIR, including its precursor report\u2014the Asian Economic Integration Monitor\u2014is the only ADB publication as of \n2018 that provides a comprehensive and regular review of RCI-related trends and issues in Asia and the Pacific. The \nAEIR has been downloaded an average of 12,000 times per issue as of May 2018. \n ", "3 \nASEAN+3 Finance and Central Bank Deputies\u2019 Meetings. Third, to increase operational support, \nthe TA cluster will conduct the biennial survey of trade finance in collaboration with ADB\u2019s Private \nSector Operations Department and produce and disseminate reports on trade finance. \n \n10.  To disseminate the AEIR, the TA cluster will hold internal and external launches in \ncollaboration with ADB\u2019s regional departments and the Department of Communications. The key \nfindings of the TA cluster\u2019s RCI-related knowledge products will also be shared in international \nconferences and seminars to be arranged by the TA cluster team in collaboration with reputable \nresearch institutions. The products will mostly be disseminated electronically, although printed \ncopies of the AEIR highlights will be circulated during AEIR launches, conferences, and seminars \nas event materials. Printed copies of the full report will be provided based on demand from policy \nmakers and other audiences. The digital platforms to be used for dissemination include ADB\u2019s \nofficial  website,  the  Asia  Regional  Integration Center (ARIC)  website,  social  media,  blogs, \ninfographics, and other online knowledge-sharing sites. \n \n11.  Output 2: Timely and up-to-date regional cooperation and integration indicators and \ndatabases are maintained and improved. The TA cluster will maintain and improve RCI \ndatabases in ADB\u2019s ARIC website,10 which comprises (i) macroeconomy and finance, including \nthe Financial Stress Index; (ii) regional integration indicators, including the Asia-Pacific Regional \nCooperation and Integration Index; (iii) the FTA database, including a tool kit to compare different \nFTA texts; (iv) the Daily Market Watch; and (v) the information portal on Asia\u2019s RCI-related \ninitiatives, including news, studies, and other important documents and meetings. The key trends \nfrom the updated databases will be captured through infographics and blogs, which will be posted \non the ARIC website and shared through social media. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $3,600,000 ($1,200,000 for each of the three TA \nsubprojects), which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF 6 for subproject 1, and subsequent TA subprojects will be financed by the succeeding \nTASF replenishment). Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements will be included in \neach TA subproject proposal submitted for approval. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA cluster, with ERCD\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration \nDivision (ERCI) being directly responsible for administration, engagement and management of \nconsultants, procurement of equipment and software, and the achievement of TA cluster outputs. \nAdhering to the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach in knowledge solutions, ERCI will compile expertise and \nknowledge  from  other  ERCD  units  (e.g.,  the  Asian  Development  Outlook  team\u2019s  regional \neconomic outlook, the Key Indicators team\u2019s global value chain data, the finance team\u2019s financial \nintegration, and the RCI thematic group\u2019s inputs on RCI operations) and other ADB departments \n(e.g.,  the  Department  of  Communications\u2019  media  expertise,  the  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment\u2019s trade finance survey, and regional departments\u2019 inputs on the AEIR). ERCI will \npursue closer coordination with ADB\u2019s operations departments in selecting research topics for \nAEIR  theme  chapters  and  identifying  appropriate  methodologies.  For  possible  research \ncollaboration and joint conferences and dissemination activities, the TA will also identify and \npartner with reputable regional or global research institutions. The implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 1. \n                                                \n10 ADB.

Subprojects. The TA cluster will be implemented through three subprojects (Appendix 2).\nEach subproject will be designed to support the achievement of the cluster outputs (paras. 9\u201311)\nas  needed  during  the  implementation  period  (Table  2).  Upon  review  by  ADB\u2019s  regional\ndepartments and other relevant departments and units, each TA subproject proposal will be\nsubmitted for approval to the director general of ERCD.

Consulting services. Individual consultants will be recruited as needed to provide an\nestimated 45 person-months of international consulting inputs and 556 person-months of national\nconsulting inputs.11 The consultants will be engaged in accordance with the ADB Procurement\nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated project administration instructions\nand/or staff instructions.12 Hiring a team of individual consultants will provide more benefits for\nADB than engaging a firm because (i) based on past implementation experiences, it is difficult to\n11 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n12 ADB will consider lump-sum payments, output-based contracts, and framework contracts for consulting services. ", "5 \nfind a firm that specializes in a wide range of RCI-related topics that AEIR and ARIC databases \ncover; (ii) it is faster to mobilize and coordinate  individual consultants, particularly for responding \nquickly to the needs of ADB Management and developing member country policy makers for  data \nand research work on emerging issues; and (iii) there is greater flexibility in engaging experts \nspecializing in a broad spectrum of RCI-related topics. \n16. International consultants will be commissioned to prepare background research papers\nfor selected topics in the AEIR and to draft and edit TA publications and ARIC website content.\nNational consultants will include senior economic analysts to lead the delivery of the TA\u2019s core\noutputs, including assigned chapters of the AEIR, and economic analysts and a statistician to\nmaintain  and  update the  ARIC  website  and  databases  and  help  prepare  the TA  project\u2019s\npublications  and  seminars.  Other  national  consultants,  including  a  system  and  database\ndeveloper and a website developer, will also be engaged to manage the ARIC website databases.\nTypesetters, graphic designers, and proofreaders will be engaged for the publication of the AEIR\nand other documents. Resource persons\u2014internationally distinguished experts, which could\ninclude ADB staff\u2014will be engaged to present or facilitate discussions at seminars and other\nevents.\n17. A team of ERCI staff will oversee and manage the implementation of the TA cluster. One\ninternational staff will be the lead project leader and lead the consultants. The TA cluster team\nmembers will include two other international staff, one national officer, one operations coordinator,\nand one operations assistant.\n18. ADB\u2019s procurement. The purchase of equipment (computer hardware and software) and\nstatistical databases will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time)\nand the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).13\nWhere applicable, the TA team will coordinate with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and\nTechnology and Office of Administrative Services in the purchase of the equipment. After the TA\nis completed, the TA team will dispose any procured equipment in compliance with the project\nadministration instructions on administering grant-financed TA projects.14 Disbursements under\nthis TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook\n(2010, as amended from time to time).\n19. Social media and websites. The TA cluster will regularly update and maintain the\nexisting ARIC website and its social media accounts.15 If there is demand for the website to\ncontinue, the project team will explore sources of financing to maintain it before project closing.\nV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n20. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3,600,000 on a grant basis for\nthe Asian Economic Integration: Building Knowledge for Policy Dialogue, 2018\u20132023, and hereby\nreports this action to the Board.\n13 Procurement Plan will be provided in each of the subproject proposal. \n14 ADB. 2013.
