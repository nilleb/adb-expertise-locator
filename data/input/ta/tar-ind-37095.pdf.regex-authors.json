India's Tenth Five-Year Plan, 2002\u20132007, identifies imperatives for invigorating rural \nIndia  by  removing  restrictions  on  agri-trading,  agro-industry,  and  agricultural  exports,  and \nthrough  public  and  private  sector  investment  in  agricultural  marketing  infrastructure  and \nfacilities,  to  support  market-oriented  farming  systems.  The  Government  of  India  (the \nGovernment) seeks assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for economically \nviable projects in agribusiness, with a particular focus on improved storage and greater value \nadded in the processing and marketing chains in order to improve efficiency and reduce post-\nharvest  losses.1  Agribusiness  includes  all  activities  in  the  production,  manufacturing, \ndistribution,  wholesale  and  retail  sales  of  agricultural  commodities.  Given the diversity of \ncommodities and marketing and processing channels in agribusiness, areas must be identified \nthat have the highest potential for economically and financially viable ADB assistance. The \nGovernment requested ADB for advisory technical assistance (TA) to assess the agribusiness \nand commercial agriculture needs. A reconnaissance mission visited India on 26 May to 3 June \n2003. A fact-finding mission on 28 July to 8 August 2003 reached an understanding with the \nGovernment  on  the  objective,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA. These were defined through a consultative process including central \nGovernment, state governments, external funding agencies, private sector, nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and local stakeholders. The TA  is included in ADB\u2019s 2003 program for \nIndia.2 The TA framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Agriculture contributed 24.2% to India\u2019s gross domestic product in 2001\u20132002 and \nprovides livelihood support to about two-thirds of the country\u2019s population. About 75% of India\u2019s \npoor live in rural areas, and 80% of them depend largely on agriculture for their livelihoods. The \nsector  provides  employment  to  56.7%  of  the  country\u2019s  workforce  and  supports  the  rural \neconomy through backward and forward linkages. India is one of the world\u2019s largest producers \nof farm commodities, and the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables. Agriculture \naccounts for about 14.7% of the country\u2019s total export earnings. India also has one of the \nworld\u2019s largest agricultural research systems, and a relatively well-developed base for research \nand development, and extension. \n \n3.  In the past four decades, India has become self-sufficient in food grains and now has a \nsurplus. Food grain production increased from 89.4 million metric tons (t) in 1964\u20131965 to 211.3 \nmillion t in 2001\u20132002, with the dissemination and adoption of green revolution technology. \nFactors contributing to this success include (i) increase in net sown area; (ii) expansion of \nirrigation facilities; (iii) land reforms, especially consolidation of holdings; (iv) development and \nintroduction of high-yielding seeds, fertilizers, improved implements and farm machines, and \ntechnology  for  pest  management;  (v)  price  policy  based  on  minimum  support  price  and \nprocurement operations; and (vi) infrastructure for storage. However, India also presents a stark \ncontrast between a large food grain surplus on the one hand and widespread rural poverty and \nmalnutrition on the other. Regional disparities have been accentuated, with agricultural and rural \ndevelopment lagging outside the states that have benefited from the green revolution. \n \n4.  The National Horticulture Board estimates domestic fruit production at about 46 million t \n(almost 10% of global production) and vegetable production at almost 90 million t (about 15% of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2003-2006): India. Manila. Expansion of ADB operations to agriculture \nis one of the most important features of the new country strategy, to mainstream poverty reduction. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 8 May 2003. ", "2   \nglobal production). Production of fruit and vegetables has been growing at compounded annual \nrates of 5% and 6%, respectively, over the past decade. Although India is the world\u2019s second \nlargest  producer  of  fruit  and  vegetables,  only  2\u20134%  of  this  production  is  commercially \nprocessed,3 in contrast to 83% in Malaysia, 78% in the Philippines, and 30% in Thailand. \nWastage is estimated to be as high as 25%. Value addition is constrained by the long value \nchain, with too many intermediaries making scale efficiencies difficult. Agriculture could be \ndiversified and the food processing industry developed, which would give a strong boost to rural \nincomes  and  have  major  multiplier  effects  on  employment  and  equitable  income  growth \nthroughout  the  economy.  The  Government  appreciates  that  a  strong  and  dynamic  food \nprocessing industry can play a vital role in diversification and commercialization of agriculture, \nensure  value  addition  to  agricultural  produce,  generate  employment,  enhance  income  of \nfarmers, and create surplus for export of processed products. \n \n5.  The Tenth Five-Year Plan suggests that the equity, efficiency, and sustainability of the \nrecent policy approach to agriculture needs to be reconsidered, in particular the strategy to \nsecure  increased  production  through  subsidies  on  inputs  (such  as  power,  irrigation,  and \nfertilizer) rather than through building new capital assets. Deteriorating state finances have \nresulted in subsidies crowding out public agricultural investment in roads and irrigation, and \nexpenditure on technological upgrading. Lack of resources has also eroded expenditure on \nmaintenance of roads and canals. These problems are particularly acute in the poorer states. In \nrecognition of the Tenth Five-Year Plan\u2019s priorities for public sector investment, the Government \nhas identified agribusiness development as a strategic priority. In India, agribusiness could have \na significant role in rural and economic development, and agro-enterprises could be a major \nsource of rural nonfarm employment and income.  \n \n6.  The major constraints to agribusiness and commercial agriculture development at the \nnational level are well-documented.4 These include (i) agriculture not being market-driven; (ii) \ndistorted incentive structures; (iii) a multiplicity of laws, regulations, and taxes; (iv) inadequate \nbackward and forward linkages; (v) poor infrastructure, especially for marketing; (vi) the poor \nstate of markets and the way they transact; (vii) inadequate outreach of services and credit to \nfarmers; (vii) lack of modernization in storage techniques and transportation methods; and (viii) \ninadequate information on and linkage with standards and requirements for exports. Value \nadded in the sector is low, with estimates of 7\u201322%. Outreach of credit and services to farmers \nis insufficient, marketing infrastructure remains poor, and transaction costs are high. A range of \npolicy and physical constraints need to be addressed to encourage private sector growth in line \nwith opportunities presented by growing incomes in India and the country increasingly opening \nup to world trade. \n \n7.  The Government has established a number of agencies and initiated several schemes to \ndevelop agribusiness for domestic and export markets. Initiatives have also been taken to \nmodernize and rationalize legislation  related to the commercialization of agriculture; but the \nmultiplicity  of  laws,  regulations,  and  taxes  remains  an  impediment.  Inefficiencies  in  the \nagricultural marketing system (for food grains and other produce) have been assessed and the \nGovernment has started implementing some of the recommendations. Recommendations relate \nto a wide range of issues, including (i) promoting direct marketing, (ii) improving credit flow to \nthe  agriculture  sector,  (iii)  improving  credit  delivery  supported  by  a  system  of  negotiable \n                                                 \n3  Statistical estimates of processing relate to the organized (formal) sector. \n4  For example, (i) Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 2002.

", "  3 \nwarehouse  receipts,  (iv)  enabling  forward  and  futures  trading,  (v)  promoting  the  use  of \ninformation  technology  in  agricultural  marketing,  and  (vi)  improving  extension  services.5 \nAgriculture being a state subject, state governments also have institutions and plans to support \ndevelopment of agro-industry. NGOs are working with rural communities to establish agro-\nbased microenterprises. The organized private sector is also active in this area; multinational \ncorporations are developing innovative marketing networks in rural areas through the use of \ninformation and communication technologies. However, these initiatives are, as yet, fragmented.  \n \n8.  Financial support for agribusiness development can be leveraged by linkage with the \nbanking sector\u2019s interest in supporting viable projects that allow them to meet their targets for \npriority  sector  lending.  Banks  have  taken  initiatives  such  as  entering  into  public-private \npartnerships  for  contract  farming  (in  northern  states)  and  working  with  NGOs  to  mobilize \ncommunities and develop forward and backward linkages for commercialization of agriculture \n(in southern states). Banks with a widespread network of branches can play a major role in the \ndevelopment process. Opportunities for improved market information and access also exist, \nbuilding  on  India\u2019s  well-developed  infrastructure  and  skill-base  in  information  and \ncommunication  technologies.  Another  \u201cdriver\u201d  is  the  need  to  be  globally  competitive,  with \nopportunities presented by world trade agreements. Making full use of these opportunities \nrequires addressing a number of constraints at different levels, and taking a more holistic \napproach to value addition in agriculture. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  assess  and  prioritize  opportunities  for  agribusiness \ninvestment and growth with strong private sector focus. This will contribute to the longer-term \ngoal of raising rural incomes and reducing poverty by raising the productivity of land and water \nresources in a sustainable manner through diversified agricultural production and enhanced \nemployment and value addition in the marketing system. The TA will synthesize information and \nanalyses of the agribusiness sector, undertake new field studies in selected states, consult \nwidely with farmers and public and private sector stakeholders concerned, and identify priority \ninvestments and complementary policy and institutional reforms. Thus, the TA will assist the  \nefficient preparation, in 2004, of ADB's proposed initial agribusiness loan.6 The TA will produce \na comprehensive synthesis document that identifies opportunities, constraints, and strategies; \nprioritizes approaches for development of commercial agriculture and agribusiness in India; and \nidentifies complementary policy and institutional reforms needed. \n \n10.  The primary outputs of this TA will be (i) an assessment of the policy, legal, and \nregulatory environment for agribusiness, including constraints to private sector activity; (ii) an \nanalysis of economic efficiency of the value chain; (iii) an inventory of past and ongoing \ninterventions and survey of lessons learned; (iv) an assessment of potential social and poverty \nimpacts  (including  a  case  study  on  contract  farming);  (v)  an  assessment  of  needs  and \nopportunities for agribusiness development; (vi) an agribusiness development road map and \nstrategy, including investment priorities and approaches for agribusiness development for four \ntarget investment states, and a reform agenda to support these priorities; and (vii) a national \nseminar to disseminate and validate the findings of the TA. \n                                                 \n5  Government of India, Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Agriculture and Cooperation. 2002.

Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will make an assessment at the national and state levels. States to be covered \nhave been selected to provide a geographic spread, as well as an overview of different levels of \ndevelopment of agribusiness and commercialization of agriculture. The TA will review examples \nof agribusiness initiatives in up to six states, to draw lessons for future design of investment \nprojects. These will be documented as case studies as part of the TA outputs. Focus group \ndiscussions and consultations in these states, and their participation in the national seminar at \nthe end of the TA will also give the states an opportunity to learn from the experience of the TA \nteam. The states identified for this purpose are Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, \nMaharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttaranchal. In addition, the TA will study in detail four selected \nstates, to prepare an agribusiness development roadmap and strategy, and identify investment \npriorities. The states targeted for potential investments are (i) Chhattisgarh, a focal state for \nADB assistance, where planned ADB assistance for development of irrigation and rural roads \nwill support and have synergy with diversification of agriculture; (ii) Jammu and Kashmir, given \nhigh  priority  by  the  Government,  and  with  apparent  comparative  advantage  for  certain \nhorticulture crops; (iii) Punjab, which has been at the forefront of the green revolution,  now \ntrying to shift from agriculture to agribusiness, with need for crop diversification in part driven by \nsoil degradation and depleting water resources from the rapid rotation of rice and wheat crops; \nand (iv) Sikkim, a new focal state for ADB assistance, as part of the Government\u2019s priorities to \nsupport development of the northeastern states. The selection of states and specific initiatives \nto be reviewed will be finalized by the national counterpart team, in consultation with ADB, in the \ncontext of finalizing the consultants\u2019 work plan at TA inception. \n \n12.  The TA will (i) review available information from secondary sources, including relevant \ninternational  experience;  (ii)  develop  case  studies,  based  on  both  primary  and  secondary \ninformation to be collected through field visits to the target states, on specific ongoing initiatives \n(including contract farming and the use of information and communication technologies in \ncommercialization of agriculture); and (iii) use a consultative process of focus group discussions \nand stakeholder workshops to identify constraints and opportunities, and to define and prioritize \ninvestment needs and a supporting reform agenda. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $750,000  equivalent,  comprising $220,000 in foreign \nexchange  and  $530,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  An  amount  of  $600,000  equivalent, \ncomprising the entire foreign exchange cost and $380,000 equivalent of the local currency cost, \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom, and administered \nby ADB. The Government and state governments will contribute the balance of the local \ncurrency cost of $150,000 equivalent through the provision of counterpart staff, office space, \nadministrative services, and data. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are given in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC) of the Ministry of Agriculture will \nbe the Executing Agency for this TA. DAC is responsible for formulating and implementing \nnational policies and programs aimed at achieving rapid agricultural growth through optimum \nuse of the country\u2019s resources. DAC will nominate a TA manager to lead the counterpart team \nand working group, and a TA coordinator, who will work closely with the consultants\u2019 team, \nfacilitate their interactions with other government agencies (central and state), facilitate access ", "  5 \nto data and information from DAC and other government departments and organizations, and \nassist in arranging field visits.7 One person each will be nominated as a focal point for the TA \nfrom (i) key organizations such as Agricultural and Processed Foods Export Development \nAuthority,  Export-Import  Bank  of  India,  Ministry  of  Food  Processing  Industry,  National \nHorticulture Board, Small Farmers\u2019 Agribusiness Consortium; and (ii) each of the states to be \ncovered by the TA. The focal points will comprise the national counterpart team. In addition, \nnominees of each of the three national chambers of commerce and industry will represent the \nprivate sector in the team.8 A subset of this team, including the private sector representatives, \nwill comprise the counterpart working group. The roles of the counterpart team and working \ngroup are elaborated in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 5 months, commencing in November 2003, with \ncompletion expected by April 2004. A total of 34 person-months of consulting services will be \nrequired: 9 person-months of international consulting, comprising an agribusiness development \nspecialist  and  an  agricultural  economist,  and  25 person-months  of  national  consulting, \ncomprising specialists in agribusiness, marketing, agricultural technology, horticulture, agro-\nprocessing, credit, information and communications technology, and social development. ADB \nwill  recruit  an  international  consulting  firm  in  association  with  domestic  consultants,  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will be selected using the \nsimplified  technical  proposal  procedure,  and  advance  action  will  be  taken  to  recruit  the \nconsultants. Outline terms of reference are provided in Appendix 3. Equipment to be procured \nunder the TA will be handed over to DAC upon TA completion. \n \n16.  The following outputs will be produced: (i) an inception report, at the end of the second \nweek of the TA, giving the detailed work plan based on the final selection of states; (ii) a \nmidterm report and sector profile, at the end of 2 months; (iii) a national seminar, to present and \nvalidate the TA outcomes, at the end of 4 months; and (iv) a final report, incorporating feedback \nand comments, upon completion of the TA. Tripartite review meetings will be held on completion \nof the inception and midterm reports, and in conjunction with the national seminar. \n \n17.  Active involvement of stakeholders, including farmers and small-scale entrepreneurs, will \nbe sought by organizing focus group discussions and stakeholder workshops at the state and \ncentral levels. The private sector will be proactively engaged in the assessment, through the \ncounterpart team, the focus group discussions, and the development of case studies that are \nlargely based on private sector initiatives. The workshops, and a concluding national seminar, \nwill disseminate results and obtain feedback from stakeholders in the public and private sectors. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to the Government \nof India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for the \nAgribusiness and Commercial Agriculture Assessment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n7  DAC programs cover a range of activities, from ensuring timely and adequate supply of inputs and services to \nagriculture marketing. DAC is organized in 22 divisions and other organizational units, with offices all over the \ncountry providing for coordination at the state level. Given its broad functions and capacity, DAC was identified as \nthe appropriate executing agency for this overall assessment. \n8  The Associated Chambers of  Commerce and Industry of India, Confederation of Indian Industry, and Federation of \nIndian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
