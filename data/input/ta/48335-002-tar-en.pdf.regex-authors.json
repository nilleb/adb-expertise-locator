INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the implementation of \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) transport strategy plans, which promote \nregional cooperation through competitive and sustainable transport corridors.1 This TA builds on \nand continues the work of two TA projects: Technical Assistance for Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation: Knowledge Sharing and Services in Transport and Transport Facilitation; \nand Technical Assistance for Enhancing Road Safety for Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation Member Countries.2 These two projects have significantly advanced knowledge \nexchange in transport within the CAREC region while also supporting the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  as  CAREC  secretariat.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030;  ADB's \nOperational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020; and ADB\u2019s CAREC 2030 \nprogram.3 The TA is also in line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership \nstrategies for CAREC member countries.4 \n \n2.  The CAREC Program is a partnership of 11 countries and development partners working \ntogether to promote development through cooperation, leading to accelerated growth and poverty \nreduction.5 The  program  facilitates  projects  and  policy  initiatives  that  support  sustainable \neconomic growth and shared prosperity in the region. As of December 2018, CAREC member \ncountries and development partners had financed investments worth more than $34.5 billion, the \nmajority (75%) of which were transport sector projects. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Transport remains the primary vehicle for regional cooperation and integration in CAREC \nmember countries. Aiming to transform CAREC member countries from landlocked to land-linked, \nthe  CAREC  Program  supports  the  expansion  of  trade  and  the  acceleration  of  economic \ndevelopment by more closely connecting the CAREC region with its neighbors. The development \nof  an  effective,  efficient,  sustainable,  safe  and  user-friendly  multimodal  corridor  network  is \nessential to achieving this goal. Transport has therefore remained the largest sector of activity in \nthe CAREC program. \n \n4.  The CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020 (TTFS 2020), approved in \n2013, guides CAREC initiatives in the transport sector. To enhance the capacity of CAREC \nmember countries to implement the TTFS 2020, ADB has implemented two TA projects since \nDecember 2014 (footnote 2). These two projects focused on five priority areas: railways, road \nsafety, road asset management, transport facilitation, and aviation. The TA teams for these two \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020. Manila; ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 April 2019. \n5  The CAREC member countries are Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, \nPakistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. ADB provides financial and \nsecretariat support to the CAREC Program.  \n \n ", "2 \nprojects produced 13 knowledge products, which were made available in three languages; \norganized  eight  workshops  and/or  working  group  meetings  attended  by  more  than  200 \nparticipants  from  CAREC  member  countries;  and  conducted  the  CAREC  Transport  Sector \nCoordination Committee (TSCC) meetings from 2015 to 2019.6 \n \n5.  CAREC member countries demand knowledge solutions to advance transport policies, \nprograms, and initiatives in the five priority areas listed above. In particular, CAREC member \ncountries need support to overcome the following weaknesses: \n \n(i)  Weak institutional capacity and coordination. National transport agencies have \nweak institutional capacity and fail to coordinate with each other to maintain and \nmonitor the quality of the regional transport network.  \n(a)  Road  asset  management.  The  CAREC  road  network  totals  34,180 \nkilometers, but no universal approach to monitor and manage CAREC road \ntransport assets exists. Without sound road asset management, CAREC \nroads receive insufficient maintenance funding and servicing.  \n(b)  Road  safety.  CAREC  member  countries  are  implementing  Safely \nConnected:  A  Regional  Road  Safety  Strategy  for  CAREC  Countries, \n2017\uf02d20307 and have integrated road safety engineering in the design of \nseveral road projects, but road safety legislation, design standards, and \npractices in many countries still fall short of international good practices. \nCollection, analysis, and reporting of road accident data is limited, thereby \nrestricting the ability of CAREC member countries to formulate informed \nroad safety action plans. Furthermore, the requisite skills and knowledge \nto implement good road safety practices are limited throughout the region.  \n(c)  Aviation. Because much of the CAREC region is landlocked, air transport \nis  vital  for  the  region,  but  air  connectivity  between  CAREC  member \ncountries is sparse by international standards. A lack of competition and a \nlack of market access are the main factors inhibiting the growth of aviation \nin the region. Aviation and the Role of CAREC: A Scoping Study found that \nbilateral and multilateral air service agreements between countries are too \nlimited in scope.8 \n(d)  Transport facilitation. Despite CAREC countries desire to implement an \nintegrated approach to cross-border transport and logistics, institutional \ncoordination between national transport agencies and border management \nagencies remains weak in CAREC member countries. As a result, the \naverage cost and time it takes to clear borders remains high, while the \naverage speed of cross-border travel is slow by both road and rail.  \n \n(ii)  Insufficient knowledge management and dissemination. CAREC program has \ndeveloped several knowledge products in subsectors such as railways, road asset \nmanagement, aviation, and road safety under ongoing ADB TA projects (footnote \n6). The new CAREC transport strategy will focus on policy reforms to improve the \nsustainability of regional transport systems and infrastructure\u2014areas in which \nCAREC member countries experience substantial knowledge gaps. Hence, a \nstrong need exists to accumulate and disseminate good practices in the priority \n                                                \n6  Knowledge products included a strategy paper on railways, a literature review, sector progress reports and work \nplans, a compendium of best practices and case studies, manuals, a scoping study, and a blog. \n7  ADB. 2016.

Lessons and/or achievements from ongoing ADB TA projects that the proposed TA will \nincorporate include the following: (i) stronger engagement at the national level (e.g., development \nof national strategies and action plans and national capacity development activities); (ii) more \nsupport for and coordination with CAREC regional cooperation coordinators and ADB resident \nmissions  to  enhance  communication  with  national  governments  and  ensure  effective \ndissemination of knowledge products; and (iii) dynamic feedback from countries to ensure that \nknowledge products are demand-driven and relevant regionally and nationally. \n \n7.  The 18th CAREC TSCC meeting, held 25\uf02d26 April 2019, approved the new CAREC \nTransport Strategy 2030.9 At this meeting, CAREC member countries expressed that they \nappreciated the support provided by ongoing and previous ADB TA, and requested new TA to \nsupport the implementation of the new strategy.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: reliability, resilience, and sustainability of \ntransportation systems improved.10 The TA will have the following outcome: Capacity of CAREC \nmember countries to implement CAREC transport sector strategic plans enhanced.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Policy  dialogue  and  knowledge  sharing  among  member  countries \nfacilitated. Through the TA, the Technical Assistance Supervising Unit (TASU) will facilitate \nregional cooperation by supporting the organization of TSCC annual meetings, which will guide \nimplementation of the CAREC Transport Strategy 2030. These may include policy and technical \nmeasures  to  address  emerging  issues  in  priority  areas  such  as  road  safety,  road  asset \nmanagement, cross-border transport and logistics facilitation, railways, and aviation. The CAREC \nsecretariat will prepare policy briefs and technical papers to facilitate dialogue. The TASU will also \nfacilitate the development of future project pipelines for sustainable transport projects in CAREC \nmember countries. In addition, the CAREC Program will organize subsector discussions and \nregional thematic forums for stakeholders to exchange experiences and best practices.  \n \n10.  Output  2:  Skills  and  capacity  of  transport  agencies  in  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation member countries on key areas in transport improved. The TA team \nwill support institutional capacity development by conducting at least five training workshops on \npriority  transport  topics  for  at  least  150  participants,  to  be  preceded  by  a  training  needs \nassessment and gap analysis. \n \n11.  Output 3: Knowledge products produced and disseminated. The TA will support \npreparation and dissemination of publications and organizing events in key CAREC transport \n                                                \n9  CAREC. 2019.

Manila. \n11 Relevant strategic plans include TTFS 2020, Transport Strategy 2030, existing strategic plans for rail and road safety, \nand a strategic plan for aviation outlined in the scoping study. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "4 \nareas. Knowledge products produced will focus on the latest advances and best practices and \nwill  highlight  modern  technologies  and  approaches.  The  CAREC  Secretariat  will  post  the \npublications on the CAREC website and print them for external dissemination upon the request \nof CAREC member countries.12 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nUnited Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity under the Regional Cooperation \nand Integration Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  Central  and  West  Asia  Transport  and \nCommunications Division (CWTC) of the Central and West Asia Department will administer the \nTA. A team comprising at least one international staff and one operations assistant will oversee \nthe implementation of the TA. The team will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; organize \nworkshops and conferences; and monitor implementation of the TA in coordination with CAREC \nconsultants based in member countries.  \n \n14.  TA implementation emphasizes intra-agency and interagency coordination. Hence, the TA \nteam will coordinate with the teams of other ADB TA projects supporting CAREC 2030 to enhance \noutreach, maximize benefits, and save costs.13 In addition, ADB staff in the transport technical \nsector group will serve as resource persons for the TA. The CWTC will also collaborate with all \nCAREC  development  partners,  particularly  with  the  CAREC  Institute,  to  organize  joint \nknowledge events. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 30 months from July 2019 to December 2021. ADB will \nengage about 19 person-months of international and 57 person-months of national consulting \nservices, including at least five specialists and resource persons (international, 19 person-months \ncombined);  a  regional  cooperation  officer  (national,  30  person-months);  research  officers \n(national, 12 person-months, intermittent); and a coordination officer (national, 12 person-months, \nintermittent). Given the diversity of topics, the independent nature of most individual assignments, \nand their short duration, ADB will recruit the consultants individually. The terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. Other activities to be financed by the TA include study tours, \nseminars, and workshops. \n \n16.  Since the precise scope of studies will be defined during implementation, ADB will \nmaintain flexibility in engaging specialists. Once the scope of the studies is defined and agreed \nupon with CAREC governments, The CAREC Secretariat will prepare detailed terms of reference \nfor the consultants. Where appropriate, ADB will consider lump-sum or output-based contracts \nfor these services. Where the consulting terms of reference call for the services of a firm, ADB\u2019s \nProcurement, Portfolio, and Financial Management Department will support the procurement. \n \n                                                \n12  CAREC. www.carecprogram.org. \n13  ADB.  2014.
