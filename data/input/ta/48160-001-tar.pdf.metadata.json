INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country programming mission in 2014, the Government of the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) requested technical assistance (TA) to strengthen capacity in \nurban water supply and sanitation management. An Asian Development Bank (ADB) TA fact-\nfinding mission visited Vientiane in the Lao PDR from 22 to 26 September 2014 and agreed on \nthe  proposed  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference with the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT). \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Lao PDR\u2019s population in 2011 was estimated at 6.4 million, of whom a third reside in \nfive large urban centers and 150 small towns in 148 districts.2 Gross domestic product was \nestimated at $1,445 per capita in 2012 and $1,620 in 2013. An estimated 22.9% of people were \nliving under the poverty line in 2012, down from 28.0% in 2008. The development of urban \ncenters and small towns is important to improve living conditions and public health, strengthen \nrural\u2013urban linkages, generate employment, and narrow regional income disparities. Increased \naccess to safe and reliable water and sanitation plays a vital role in the economic development of \nthese towns. The government\u2019s urban sector targets for water supply and sanitation are 90% \ncoverage for piped water supply and 100% coverage for sanitation by 2030. About 60% of urban \nresidents had access to piped water supply and 90% to improved sanitation in 2012.3 The urban \nwater supply sector decentralized to the provincial level in 1999 and is comprised of 16 provincial \nnam papas (PNPs, or provincial water supply utilities) and Nam Papa Nakhone Luang (Vientiane \nCapital Water Supply Utility). These utilities are state-owned enterprises (or state companies), \nwhich are required to perform as corporate entities under the Enterprise Law, 2005. \n3.  Investments in water supply and sanitation in the Lao PDR have aimed at improving \nsupply-side infrastructure to respond to the economic water scarcity in the country.4 Since the \n1990s, ADB has contributed to national targets as a lead development partner in the sector \nthrough infrastructure financing for water supply systems in Vientiane capital, secondary towns, \nand small district towns. ADB projects have financed the development and rehabilitation of \nabout 31 new piped water supply systems, improving access for nearly 300,000 people. By \n2015,  12  more  systems  will  be  constructed  and  rehabilitated.  ADB  investment  has  also \nincreased the access and coverage of household sanitation in project towns to nearly 100%; \nhouseholds are required to improve household latrines prior to receiving a free household water \nconnection, and poor households are eligible for a sanitation grant. Other development partners \nhave also contributed to these targets.   \n4.  The concept of good water governance is new in the Lao PDR; it requires improving \nmanagement of water as a resource across competing users and the delivery of water supply \nservice in an efficient manner. The value of water as a limited resource and the competing \ndemands on water for drinking, energy, and irrigation are increasingly recognized. Water and \nenergy, for instance, are linked in two ways\u2014water is used in the production of energy, and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 November 2014. The pre-TA \nfact-finding mission was upgraded to a TA fact-finding mission on 2 October 2014.  \n2  Government of the Lao PDR, Lao Statistics Bureau. 2012. Ministry of Planning and Investment Statistical Yearbook \n2011.  Vientiane.  Town  classification,  under  review,  cites  Vientiane  as  the  capital,  four  secondary  towns \n(>20,000 people), provincial or small district towns (4,000\u201320,000 people), and small towns (<4,000 people). \n3  World Health Organization and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund Joint Monitoring Programme. 2014.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nenergy is the main cost factor in the provision of water and wastewater services. While energy \nproduction depends on water, it does not consume a considerable amount of water; rather, water \nuse in energy production affects water quality. Conversely, every liter of water that passes through \nthe water supply system represents a significant energy cost. Efficiency in the delivery of water \nsupply service involves both stabilizing peak demand and managing the end use of water (such \nas water reuse or recycling, efficient toilets, low-flow showerheads). Most inefficiency in water \nsupply occurs before the water reaches the end user (such as water leaks). Energy and water \nefficiency improvements in water utilities generate impressive reductions in operating costs and \noften improve service. A review in 2013 found that energy-saving measures could reduce energy \nconsumption in the Lao PDR\u2019s small town water supply systems by at least 20%\u201330%.5  \n5.  Based on seven PNPs, electricity costs are on average 14% of total operating costs \n(from 2% in primarily gravity systems to 22% in pumped systems). In 2011, 16 PNPs supplied \nabout 30.5 billion cubic meters (m3) of treated water to their customers and spent an estimated \nKN9.6 billion ($1.2 million) on electricity.6 A 30% saving in electricity costs could save the PNPs \nabout KN2.9 million ($360,000) per year, and could reduce tariffs by about KN90/m3 on average \n(30% of KN313/m3). The main areas for achieving improved energy efficiency are associated \nwith pumping systems, leakage management, and system automation. Scope to achieve energy \nsavings in water treatment and water utility buildings is limited. The TA will build capacity among \nPNPs in good water governance, and will assist them in conducting energy audits, and in \nidentifying energy efficiency and water reuse measures that help reduce operating costs. \n6.  The TA will complement PNP training with support to the proposed department of water \nsupply of MPWT in module development for energy and water efficiency. MPWT\u2019s Water Supply \nand Sanitation Strategy, 2013\u20132030 is implementing the Water Supply Law, 2009. It defines a role \nfor the new department (to address the specific needs of the water supply and sanitation sector) \nand  includes  a  focus  on  future  demand-side  activities.7 The  TA  will  support  the  proposed \ndepartment and help demonstrate the importance of addressing water supply and sanitation \ntogether, as water is a limited resource and requires greater efficiency in the way it is managed \nfrom source to disposal and/or reuse or recycle. The department will include a sanitation division \nfor wastewater, water reuse and recycling, and sanitation issues. The Department of Housing and \nUrban  Planning  (DHUP)  of  MPWT,  whose  remit  includes  water  supply  and  sanitation,  will \nimplement the TA if establishment of the proposed department is delayed.8 \n7.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Lao PDR, 2012\u20132016, \nwhich prioritizes water supply and other municipal infrastructure and services.9 It is listed in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan for the Lao PDR, 2014\u20132016, and is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Assessment Strategy and Road Map for Urban Development in the Lao PDR and the \nSector Assessment (Summary) for Water Supply and Urban Development and sector problem \ntree.10 The TA explores ways to reduce the operating costs of water supply systems, given the \nlimited funds for operation and maintenance; it supports implementation of the Water Supply \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2012.

It is also in line with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 under Strategy \n2020, which promotes working with corporate water utilities to strengthen financial management, \nreduce inefficiencies, and stabilize water consumption through robust demand management.11  \n8.  The TA builds on ADB\u2019s ongoing capacity development support to MPWT, the Water \nSupply Regulatory Committee (WSRC), and PNPs in urban water supply sector development \nand regulation, improved water supply utility performance, and private sector participation. ADB \nsector loan projects have improved the operational and financial performance of PNPs through \nregular  tariff  increases  and  reduced  arrears,  while  ensuring  affordable  services  to  poor \nhouseholds. They have also focused on strengthening good corporate governance in the sector \nthrough support to (i) PNPs in the preparation, implementation, and updating of 3-year rolling \ncorporate  plans;  and  (ii) provincial  governments  and  water  utilities  in  the  preparation  and \nmonitoring  of  service  contracts  with  WSRC-approved  benchmarking  indicators.  The  TA \ncomplements ongoing project and TA activities by focusing on improved management while \ncontinuing to manage the tariff framework. Parallel ADB support in governance and public \nsector management, including regulatory impact assessments and private sector development, \nhas helped sustain urban water and sanitation developments in the Lao PDR.12   \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved operational and financial performance among water supply \nutilities. The outcome will be strengthened capacity in water supply and sanitation management \nfor improved efficiency in municipal water use. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Output 1: Water supply utilities improve their practices in water use management. \nThe TA will support the proposed water supply department of MPWT and PNPs in identifying \ngreater  energy  efficiency  measures  and  possible  water  reuse  and  recycling  opportunities\u2014\npromoting good water governance. It will support a demand management study to illustrate the \nimpact  and  costs  for measures  to  reduce  water  demand  and  cost  for  municipal  water  use \n(i.e., water at source and the cost of associated treatment). It will assist four PNPs to (i) identify a \nseries of energy efficiency measures for water supply systems, including energy audits; and (ii) \ndevelop an approach for water recycling and reuse, with costed measures. It will build PNPs\u2019 \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific.

This will be \nbased on a review of examples from the region and other partner initiatives (World Bank\u2019s Thirsty \nEnergy).13 It will complement a recent ADB-supported project, approved in 2013, that focuses on \nnonrevenue water, water loss audits, and asset management (footnote 12). The PNPs selected \nwill be from the pool of PNPs on ADB projects.14 A set of modules will be developed to assist the \nproposed water supply department to train other PNPs in identifying energy efficiency measures \nand developing an approach for water recycling and reuse.  \n11.  Output  2:  Water  supply  utilities  improve  monitoring  of  their  operational  and \nfinancial performance. The TA will work with the same four PNPs (as in output 1) to develop a \nnew system or to adapt an existing grading system to allow each to self-monitor its operational \nand financial performance against an efficiency index based on key performance  indicators, \nincluding a new indicator on energy savings or water use. The efficiency index will incorporate \noutput 1 findings with results of the ongoing regulatory TA, which supports the WSRC and PNPs \nin reviewing benchmarking indicators, refining the methodology for data collection, and conducting \nperformance audits of PNPs (footnote 12). Trained PNP staff will be able to analyze the data in \ntheir corporate plans, and to communicate operational and financial efficiency improvements more \neffectively to tariff-approving authorities through a single index. The output will work in parallel with \nongoing ADB-financed sector projects that support participating PNPs to update their corporate \nplans. It will include a review of existing grading systems and initiatives in the sector, supported by \nADB  and  other  agencies  (e.g.,  the  Inter-American  Development  Bank  AquaRating  and  the \nInternational Water  Association  Water  Utility  Efficiency  Assessment  Matrix).  Modules  will  be \ndeveloped to help the new water supply department train other PNPs on the grading systems. \n12.  Output  3:  Enhanced  knowledge  management  through  roundtable  discussions. \nThis TA will develop the capacity of the proposed water supply department and PNPs through \nroundtable discussions. These discussions will strengthen the capacity of sector officials and \nPNPs through regional exchange and knowledge management. They will focus on operational \nand financial performance topics such as corporate and water governance. The output will \nidentify resource speakers from regional water supply utilities or government departments. It will \nbuild  on  the  experience  of  water  operators\u2019  partnerships  and  other  forums.  A  knowledge \nmanagement  series  will  be  developed  to  showcase  sector  reform  experiences  and  good \ncorporate and water governance with other utilities and government officials in Southeast Asia. \n13.  Output 4: Institutional development and support for improved water and sanitation \nmanagement. The TA will assist the proposed water supply department in implementing its \ninstitutional mandate, especially with respect to sanitation. It will help the department prepare an \nurban sanitation strategic framework and road map to 2030, which will focus on on-site sanitation \nsystems, decentralized wastewater systems, and centralized wastewater systems; and highlight \nthe synergies with good water governance. The urban sanitation strategic framework and road \nmap will be in line with the Ministry of Health\u2019s sanitation policy (for approval in 2016). \n14.  The  main  risk  to  the  TA  is  that  the  establishment  of  the  proposed  water  supply \ndepartment is delayed. In its absence, the TA will be implemented by DHUP. Assumptions \ninclude (i) WSRC and the Water Supply Regulatory Office continue to regulate PNP performance \nthrough annual water sector performance reports; (ii) other capacity development assistance by \ndevelopment partners continues in parallel; (iii) PNPs selected are participating in ADB projects, \nwhich  will  support  implementation  of  recommendations  and  accompanying  infrastructure \n                                                \n13 D.

Washington DC. \n14  Nam Papa Nakhone Luang and Binh Duong Water Supply Sewerage Environment Company Limited of Binh Giang \nprovince of Viet Nam are twinning through parallel ADB TA to address nonrevenue water management, energy \nsavings, and customer relations. The TA will coordinate with this activity. \n ", "  5 \nimprovements to water supply systems; (iv) energy efficiency action plans and water recycle and \nreuse measures are incorporated in participating PNPs\u2019 corporate plans; (v) energy efficiency \nand water reuse measures are incorporated in future water supply systems; (vi) grading systems \ndeveloped  by  development  partners  are  available  in  English;  (vii) regional  participants  and \nresource speakers are available to participate in roundtable discussions; and (viii) the Ministry of \nHealth sanitation policy sets forth the overarching policy framework for sanitation. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, of which $1.3 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, air-conditioned office and work space (no \noffice furniture), secretarial assistance, local transport to site visits in the provinces, standard \ninternet  access,  workshop  and  training  facilities,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months (1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017). The \nexecuting agency is MPWT, specifically the water supply department (or DHUP). The TA will \ncoordinate with WSRC, DHUP, and PNPs. Participating PNPs will be selected based on the \navailability  of  an  updated  corporate  plan;  sufficient  budget  to  implement  the  measures  and \nsuggestions by the TA; office space for the TA consultants; and counterpart technical staff (three\u2013\nfive persons) to work with the TA consultants, of which at least one should be a female PNP staff. \nThe project steering committee for ADB water supply and sanitation projects will help coordinate \nthe TA. A budget is allocated for regional meetings for staff from the water supply department.  \n17.  Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Implementation support will include the \nconsulting  services  of  a  firm.  The  firm  will  be  engaged  following  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection (90:10, full technical proposal) for 48 person-months (four international specialists for \n36 person-months and one national specialist for 12 person-months).15 The consultants will \nassist MPWT in procuring office equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time). All equipment procured will be handed over to MPWT at \nthe end of the TA. Goods will be procured using the shopping procedure, as packages are \nexpected to be less than $100,000 equivalent. TA consultants will administer the costs for \nworkshops,  training,  and  surveys.  Disbursements  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n18.  The design and monitoring framework will be used to monitor the TA. Pre- and post-tests \nwill be administered during workshops and roundtable discussions. Good practices and lessons \nwill be disseminated through workshops, reports, the roundtable discussion series, and other \nknowledge products.
