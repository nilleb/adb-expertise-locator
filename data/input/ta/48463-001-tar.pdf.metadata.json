INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2014  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical \nassistance (TA) to the Pilot Program for Establishing a Support Framework for Sustainable \nVillage Community Funds.1 After a fact-finding mission in April 2015, ADB and the government \nreached an understanding on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and \nterms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s outstanding economic performance has come at the cost of some serious \nimbalances\u2014between  coastal  and  inland  regions,  and  between  urban  and  rural  areas. \nBalanced and inclusive growth is one of the main themes in the government\u2019s 12th Five-Year \nPlan (2011\u20132015).3 Both the government and ADB view the development of inclusive finance as \none of the key policy measures to achieve inclusive growth.4 The PRC banking system has \nplayed a dominant role in the financial market by mobilizing a large pool of deposits and \nproviding an estimated 95% of corporate financing. However, many rural and poor households, \nas well as small and medium-sized enterprises, still find it very difficult to access credit.5 \n \n3.  In response to these problems, the State Council\u2019s Leading Group Office for Poverty \nAlleviation (LGOP) and the Ministry of Finance launched a village community fund program in \n100 villages of 14 provinces in 2009, following two small pilot programs in Henan and Sichuan \nprovinces.6 The village community fund program is an innovative microfinance model whereby \ncommunity  members  contribute  to  and  manage  a  revolving  fund  scheme  with  the  aim  to \ngenerate income within a village; it consists of about 80% of government contribution and 20% \nof members\u2019 contributions. Designed as a community-driven microfinance model targeting the \nrural and poor, the fund has a loan ceiling of CNY5,000 per member household, and the loans \nhave a tenor of up to 1 year and are backed by group guarantee. The program not only reduces \ntransaction costs and credit risks thanks to insider information and community monitoring, but \nalso builds the capacity of poor rural communities and households. The villagers elect their fund \nmanagers  in  village  meetings,  participate  in  drafting  the  fund  operating  rules  and  loan \nprocedures, and help monitor the funds. \n \n4.  By the end of 2014, 21,727 village community funds had been set up in 1,260 counties \nof 28 provinces and autonomous regions. Total financing for the funds amounted to CNY4.278 \nbillion\u2014CNY934 million (21.8%) came from the central government budget, CNY2.389 billion \n(55.8%)  from  local  government  budgets,  and  CNY955  million  (22.3%)  from  members\u2019 \ncontributions. Some 1.66 million rural households, or 28% of all rural households in the program \nregion, joined the funds. On average, a village community fund had 85 member households and \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2015-2017. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 July 2015. \n3  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform Commission. 2011. 12th Five-\nYear Plan (2011\u20132015). Beijing. \n4  An inclusive financial system is one that services all clients, not just the relatively well-off. This means servicing \npoor and low-income clients with a wide range of accessible products. \n5  An  analysis  of  county  surveys  and  statistical  data  indicates  that  10  million\u201317  million  households  and \nmicroenterprises need access to formal credit, for an estimated total of CNY1.3 trillion\u20132.3 trillion. In addition to \nformal credit, 41 million\u201348 million rural households still need informal credit as well, for an average loan size of \nCNY36,000. At present, the financial institutions are not meeting the scale and dimensions of this demand. \n6  Pilot projects in Henan and Sichuan were introduced in 2006-2009. \n ", "2  \na revolving fund size of CNY280,000. The funds struggle to achieve financial and institutional \nviability because they target state-designated poor communities and households\u201454.6% of the \nfund members are poor households. By the end of 2012, village community funds had provided \nCNY7.63 billion (equivalent to $1.59 million) in loans to their members. Over 55% of the loans \nwere provided to the poor members. The central LGOP has delegated the supervision and \nmonitoring of the village funds to the respective Poverty Alleviation and Development Center \n(PADC) on behalf of the local LGOPs.  \n \n5.  Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) was one of the first autonomous regions to \nintroduce the village community fund program in 2006, after the LGOP had identified potential \ncandidates among the counties that subsisted on semiarid farming and animal husbandry. By \nthe end of 2014, IMAR had set up community funds in 1,110 villages of 80 counties. The funds \ntotaled CNY230 million while the cumulative loans exceeded CNY540 million. The program has \ngreatly supported the income-generating activities of poor farmers and herders because IMAR \nadopted the \u201c3 over 50\u201d rule: over 50 members of the village fund are farmers and herders, over \n50% of the poor households in a village join the village funds, and over 50% of the borrowers \nare poor borrowers. Since its inception in 2012, the PADC in IMAR has been responsible for \nimplementing and coordinating poverty reduction projects supported by foreign donors, and for \nmonitoring and supervising the village community funds and rural microfinance projects in IMAR.  \n \n6.  Despite these achievements in a relatively short time, the program faces numerous \nchallenges that threaten its sustainability\u2014e.g., lack of capacity and the absence of an effective \nmonitoring and supervision system, poor fund performances  because fund managers lack \nknow-how and experience, limited growth, and small fund sizes because access to wholesale \nfunding is proving difficult.7   \n \n7.  Foremost  among  the  constraints  are  the  inadequate  resources  and  capacities  of \nregulators,  and  the  lack  of  a  comprehensive  regulatory  framework  to  govern  the  village \ncommunity funds. The program has been monitored and supervised by the local LGOPs with \nlimited staff, coverage, and capacity. The LGOPs are also heavily burdened by other poverty \nreduction efforts in the region. The PADC, which has supervised village funds on behalf of the \nlocal  LGOPs,  is  not  physically  present  at  prefecture  and  county  levels.  This  made  timely \nacquisition of relevant data in line with the reporting requirements very difficult. In the absence \nof  a  comprehensive  computerized  data  management  and  reporting  system,  computerized \ninformation covered only 15% of the village funds nationwide. On-site supervision and auditing \nby the central LGOP proved difficult and costly in view of the large number of village funds \nacross the country.  \n \n8.  Second, the village funds have been constrained by a lack of capacity for professional \nlending  operations  and  financial  management,  leading  to  poor  fund  performance  and \nundermining the sustainability of the program. The village fund managers are elected through \nvillage meetings, but most of them do not have any experience in lending operations or in \nfinancial management. They simply rely on the general guideline and handbook provided by the \nLGOP, and proper training to improve their capacities is rarely provided. A related issue is the \ninability of village funds to access wholesale funding, which worsens their financial performance.  \n \n9.  Finally, the village community fund program needs a reform strategy based on the \ninsights  gained  so  far,  with  sound  policy  measures  to  improve  the  overall  efficiency  and \n                                                \n7  The nonperforming loans of village community funds in IMAR are estimated to amount to more than 20% based on \nthe interviews conducted during field visits, although no official statistics are available to corroborate this. \n ", "  3\nperformance of fund operations. To increase the program\u2019s sustainability and outreach, access \nto wholesale funding is essential. The new strategy also needs to find ways to overcome the \nconstraints and provide a road map for easier access to wholesale financing.  \n \n10.  Aligned with the PRC\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan for 2011\u20132015, the ADB country partnership \nstrategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC identifies inclusive growth as one of the strategic pillars. The \nTA supports inclusive growth by improving access to finance through reforms to the village \ncommunity fund program. ADB has previously helped build an inclusive, market-oriented, rural \nfinance system and strengthened the financial regulatory regime with policy recommendations \nand capacity building. ADB also has published a report on the community-driven development \npilot projects in PRC.8 The proposed TA will build on these achievements and lessons.9 \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be improved financial access for rural and poor households in IMAR. The \noutcome will be the successful reform of village community funds based on the TA outputs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA aims to improve the outreach and long-term financial sustainability of the village \ncommunity fund program by (i) developing an efficient monitoring and supervision framework for \nthe village funds, (ii) enhancing the capacity of village community fund managers and regulators, \n(iii) introducing advanced lending operations and systems, and (iv) establishing a strategy and \nroad map to reform fund operations and broaden access to wholesale lending.   \n \n13.  The TA will develop an efficient monitoring and supervision framework to govern the \nvillage funds and prepare a knowledge product and service. It will assess the feasibility of \nimproving  the  capacity  and  system  of  local  LGOPs,  creating  a  separate  monitoring  and \nsupervision agency, or shifting the responsibilities to other agencies or institutions. Ways to \ninvolve local social organizations for capacity building of regulators will be explored. Based on \nthe recommendations, pilot village community funds will be selected in IMAR and the new \nsupport framework will be implemented. The TA will also provide monitoring and reporting \nequipment for the pilot programs. The monitoring system will include sex-disaggregated data \ncollection. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  boost  the  general  capacity  of  village  community  fund  managers  and \nregulators through training sessions, a study tour, seminars, and workshops.10 It will design \ntraining modules for fund managers, accountants, and supervisors, so that the capacity-building \n                                                \n8  The community-driven development (CDD) Pilot Project in the PRC: Sharing Knowledge on CDD, is one of the four \nCDD studies conducted in the PRC, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and the Philippines under the ADB regional \ncapacity development technical assistance project, Sharing Knowledge on CDD in Asia and the Pacific (RETA \n7543, 2013). \n9 Related projects include the following: ADB. 2004.

Regulators and village community \nfund managers will be the participants. \n ", "4  \nprogram can be easily replicated and conducted in other provinces. Training for the regulators, \nin particular, has a gender target\u201430% of participants are to be women. Village fund managers \nfrom different provinces, government officials, and regulators will be invited to a dissemination \nworkshop to share the results of the pilot programs and their views on the final report.  \n \n15.  The TA will also introduce advanced lending operations and systems, and prepare \nguidelines for the proper operation of a village community fund, including anticorruption and \ngovernance measures. A manual for lending operations and risk management will be published \nand shared. \n \n16.  The TA will prepare a final report to summarize the results of the pilot programs. The \nreport will include a strategy to reform and improve the concept of the village community fund, \nand  a  step-by-step  road  map  to  achieve  better  access  to  wholesale  financing.  The  final \nrecommendations from this report, including guidelines and manuals for the operation of village \ncommunity funds, will form the basis for replicating and expanding the improved program and \nfor informing other communities in the PRC about it. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $330,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff time, access to data sources, assistance to field \ntrips  and  meetings,  use  of  office  space  and  facilities,  logistical  support,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The executing agency is the LGOP in IMAR; the implementing agency is the PADC in \nIMAR. The executing agency, with support from consultants, will administer training, seminars, \nand conferences. The advance payment facility procedure will be adopted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time) to \nfacilitate timely organization of training, seminars, and conference activities.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented from 1 August 2015 to 30 June 2017. International and \nnational consultants will be engaged through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), and proceeds will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). An advance payment facility will be made available to the executing agency to \nadminister the activities of workshops and the study tour only when direct payment to service \nproviders and suppliers is not practical. The procurement of equipment will be conducted in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The \nexecuting agency will be in charge of managing the procured equipment. \n \n20.
