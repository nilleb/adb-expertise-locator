INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support participating developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in enhancing their knowledge \nof and capacity to develop policy actions and technological solutions and build a business case \nfor air quality management through the preparation of city-level clean air action plans (CAAPs),1 \nalong with investment estimates to implement CAAPs. The support will include (i) conducting city-\nlevel air quality studies (focusing on the current situation, its impacts, and management); (ii) \nidentifying measures to address air quality, including innovative technological options, policy \nrecommendations, and enabling capacity support; and (iii) preparing city-level CAAPs, with \ninvestment estimates. \n \n2.  This TA is included in the Environment Thematic Group\u2019s 2018\u22122019 workplan.2 The TA \nis aligned with operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to make cities more livable, tackle \nclimate change, build climate and disaster resilience, enhance environmental sustainability, and \naddress poverty and reduce inequality by helping to achieve better health for all.3 In addition, the \nTA will support the implementation of ADB\u2019s Climate Change Operational Framework in the areas \nof urban resilience and climate change mitigation.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Air pollution is the most pressing environmental concern and has become a major \nchallenge to global health as a leading preventable cause of death. The combined effects of \nambient (outdoor) and household (indoor) air pollution cause about 7 million premature deaths \nannually.5 Among air pollutants, particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter is the best \nstudied  and  is  linked  to  a  wide  range  of  diseases  affecting  several  human  organs.  The \nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer has reported that airborne particulate matter and \nambient air pollution are proven \u201cGroup 1\u201d human carcinogens.6 \n \n4.  The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Ambient Air Quality Database 2018 shows \nthat more than 80% of people living in urban areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air \nquality levels that exceed WHO limits.7 While all regions of the world are affected, populations in \nlow-income cities are impacted the most. The most recent air quality data indicates almost all \ncities (97%) in low- and middle-income countries with more than 100,000 inhabitants do not meet \nWHO air quality guidelines (footnote 7).  \n \n5.  Air pollution is one of the top risks leading to early death worldwide, and responsible for \n                                                \n1 Participating cities will prepare City-level Clean Air Actions Plans (CAAPs) covering surrounding peri-urban, industrial, \nand rural areas that share the city airshed. A CAAP is expected to enable the government and broader stakeholders \nto mobilize resources in the most effective and efficient manner to achieve air quality objectives. The experience of \ncountries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) demonstrates that the CAAP has been an efficient air \npollution control instrument. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 April 2018. \n3   ADB. 2018.

Unless action \nis taken, human health risks and associated costs to society will rise rapidly. Investments in air \npollution abatement offer no regrets options9 to boost economic development (through better \nenergy-efficient technologies, improved transportation systems, and enhanced urban facilities \nand  overall  productivity),  while  mitigating  climate  change  and  contributing  to  healthier \nenvironments and more productive lives. \n \n6.  Each country and city face specific challenges that are unique to their national or local \ncontext, but common air quality management (AQM) challenges include: (i) weak institutional \ncapacity and arrangements; (ii) inappropriate policies, strategies, and supporting regulations; (iii) \nlack of reliable baseline data; (iv) lack of awareness regarding the health and environmental \nimpacts of air pollution; (v) lack of knowledge about, willingness to adopt, and access to process \nimprovements and cleaner technologies; (vi) lack of a technology transfer program; and (vii) \nabsence of financial support, incentives, and innovative financial mechanisms or approaches.  \n \n7.  Lessons from successful strategies, policies, and approaches adopted in Asian cities can \nhelp achieve better air quality.10 The TA builds on increased AQM awareness and knowledge \namong cities in the region, which has been contributed by ADB supported TAs11 and collaboration \nwith Clean Air Asia including \u2018Better Air Quality\u2019 Conference. The TA will support further efforts to \ndevelop of concrete and feasible policy and technological options to improve air quality. ADB\u2019s \nmultiyear and multisectoral TAs and investment programs (involving a policy-based loan, green \nfinancing platform, and emission control and pollution-reduction fund) for air quality improvement \nin  the  greater  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  region  showed  that  air  quality  improvement  requires \nappropriate, targeted assessment; capacity building; well-developed plans; and investments in \ncleaner  technologies.12 The  policy-based  loan  to  Mongolia  for  the  Ulaanbaatar  Air  Quality \nImprovement Program and ongoing related TA also highlight the need to overcome knowledge \ngaps and capacity constraints.13 ADB initiatives supporting urban development, clean energy, and \nsustainable transport demonstrate air quality improvement opportunities. \n \n8.  Encouragingly, extreme air pollution events have led to strong public demands for clean \nair action in many Asian cities and countries. WHO data indicate that air quality is improving in \nsome high-income Asian cities\u2014the challenge is to help low- and middle-income Asian cities \ncomply with national standards and WHO guideline values, which requires TA to further deepen \nair quality analysis, strengthen policy and institutions, and prepare CAAPs with investment \nestimates and financial mechanisms. \n \n                                                \n8  World Bank Group and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. 2016.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: air quality levels in selected DMCs improved.14 \nThe TA outcome is: commitment of selected DMCs to improve AQM increased.15   \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n  \n10.  The TA will support three primary and four secondary cities.16, 17 The TA team will select \nthe participating cities based on the following criteria: (i) air pollution levels, or the likelihood of \nincreased air pollution; (ii) commitment of DMCs and cities; and (iii) consistency with country \npriorities as indicated in the country partnership strategy. Possible participating cities include (i) \nprimary cities: Erdenet (Mongolia), Peshawar (Pakistan), and Ha Noi or Ho Chi Minh (Viet Nam); \nand (ii) secondary cities: La Trinidad (Philippines), Faridpur (Bangladesh), Sialkot (Pakistan), and \nVinh Yen (Viet Nam).18 Output 2 will be linked to national- or provincial-level policy reforms \nneeded for city-level CAAPs. The TA will enable future investments in AQM, improve air quality, \nand generate climate change mitigation benefits. The TA supports regional cooperation through \nknowledge sharing, exposure visits, and technical cooperation; and gender mainstreaming by \nensuring that at least 40% of the participants in awareness programs are women.   \n \n11.  Output 1: Current air quality situation and management practice assessed. The TA \nactivities will build on existing AQM efforts. The TA team will conduct diagnostics on air pollution \nlevels, impacts, and sources in the participating cities to increase AQM knowledge about those \ncities, and (i) carry out studies to assess air quality and management practices (i.e., emission \ninventory, source apportionment, effectiveness of AQM measures, and mitigation potentials);19 (ii) \nprocure portable air quality monitoring devices for secondary cities to fill air quality data gaps and \ntrain institutions in their operation; (iii) apply air quality tools to better understand pollution impacts \nand assess community vulnerability;20 (iv) conduct roundtable and policy dialogue with the \ngovernment and other stakeholders; and (v) design awareness programs. The TA team will refine \nthe scope of output 1 based on current AQM capacity, information available, and consultations.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Innovative cost-effective technological and policy options for addressing \nair quality evaluated. Output 2 will use experiences in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nand other countries and will (i) assess energy efficiency and emission reduction technology in \nterms of its applicability, performance, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and local context; (ii) identify \nneeds\u2014for capacity building, policy reforms, technology transfer, and other issues\u2014related to the \n                                                \n14  Defined by TA. \n15  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n16  \u201cPrimary\u201d cities are the leading city in the country or region, and disproportionately larger than other urban areas (B. \nGoodall. 1987. The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London). Secondary cities are smaller but generally \nhave at least 100,000 inhabitants.  \n17  Four secondary cities will be selected from the recipient 8 countries and 25 cities of the Urban Climate Change \nResilience Trust Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility. Most of the secondary cities lack adequate \nair quality information but offer the chance to integrate air quality in city development plans at an early stage. The \nCAAPs will cover the city and surrounding areas that share the same airshed (footnote 1). \n18  Information on Possible Participating Cities (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n19  The focus will be on (i) the most common \u201ccriteria\u201d air pollutants\u2014carbon monoxide, lead, ground-level ozone, \nparticulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide\u2014which are elements of the Air Quality Index, and (ii) \nspecifically particulate matter, especially particulates below 2.5 micrometers in diameter, because of their major \nhealth impacts. Additional pollutants will be considered based on the initial local context review.   \n20  This includes ADMS and AERMOD (Gaussian plume air dispersion model), BenMap (air pollution health impact \nassessment), non-parametric wind regression for source identification, and real-time prediction of emissions data.  \n ", "4 \nDMC\u2019s capacity to adopt these technologies; (iii) provide national and provincial-level policy \nrecommendations  linked  to  city-level  AQM;  (iv)  organize  technology  training  programs;  (v) \nundertake  visits  to  better  understand  the  PRC\u2019s  experiences,  technologies,  and  financial \nmechanisms; and (vi) coordinate a technology fair to build linkages between technology providers \nand potential government and private sector users.  \n \n13.  Output 3: City-level clean air action plans, along with investment estimates for air \npollution control, developed. Building on outputs 1 and 2, the TA will help participating cities to \n(i) develop CAAP and associated investment estimates for immediate, medium-term, and long-\nterm actions; (ii) conduct economic and financial analyses of proposed CAAP investments; (iii) \ndesign an incentive and financing mechanism to promote air quality improvement technologies; \nand (iv) identify potential domestic and international resources, including private sector funding. \nAppropriate institutional mechanisms for the preparation and implementation of CAAPs will be \nidentified based on assessments in Outputs 1 and 2.   \n \n14.  The TA approach is justified over a grant-financed project approach, given the high \ncapacity development and knowledge content.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,500,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u22126), (ii) $800,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund \nand administered by ADB, and (iii) $1,200,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Urban \nClimate Change Resilience Trust Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility and \nadministered by ADB.21 \n12F\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA through the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment (SDCC) Environment Thematic Group. SDCC will identify counterparts from relevant \noperations departments and resident missions to (i) coordinate local TA activities, (ii) facilitate \ndialogue with the government, and (iii) serve as a catalyst for the inclusion of AQM efforts in \ncountry partnership programs and project pipelines of participating DMCs. The TA team will \ncoordinate implementation with relevant sectors (energy, health, transport, and urban) and \nthematic  groups.  The  PRC\u2019s  International  Center  for  Environmental  Technology,  Foreign \nEconomic Cooperation Office, Ministry of Ecology and Environment will provide support for \nknowledge transfer, the exposure visit, and the technology fair to be organized in the PRC.  \n \n17.

City-level CAAPs, along with investment estimates for air pollution control, developed.d  \n3.1 Develop CAAP and associated investment estimates that highlight immediate, medium-term and \nlong-terms actions, and associated investment costs (Q4 2020).  \n3.2 Carry out economic and financial analyses for each CAAP investment (Q1 2021).  \n3.3 Design incentive and financing mechanisms for cities in the participating countries (Q2 2021). \n \nInputs \nADB: $500,000  \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund: $800,000 \nUrban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility: \n$1,200,000 (only targeted to secondary cities) \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CAAP = clean air action plan, COBP = country operations business plan, DMC = \ndeveloping member country, NA = not applicable, NGO = nongovernment organization, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Q = quarter, TA = technical assistance, NGO= nongovernment organization. \na  Defined by TA. \nb  ADB will engage international consultants with expertise on air quality monitoring and modeling, air quality technology \n(mitigation), air quality policy and planning, environmental economist, and finance. \nc  The TA Team will select four secondary cities from the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund\u2019s 8 countries \nand 25 cities. Most of the secondary cities do not have adequate information on air quality. However, these cities \noffer opportunity to integrate air quality in city development plans at an early stage. The city will include city and \nsurrounding peri-urban, industrial, and rural areas that share the same airshed. \nd  A CAAP intends to improve air quality and public health by identifying cost-effective measures to reduce emissions \nfrom transport, industries, waste deposits, and residential burning. CAAPs, and specifically action plans related to \ninvestments, can feed into the preparation of country partnership strategies and COBPs of the participating DMCs. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "Appendix 2  9 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Amount \nA.
